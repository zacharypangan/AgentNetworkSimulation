839,16,8,">""The snooping is still a big deal in my book, but the ones that I read and find hilarious are generally very important to the larger picture."
840,18,8,It seems like the FBI has not been able to implement the budget they had in mind and is not able to take into consideration.
841,22,8,">Do you like Trump? This is the most controversial thing to hear today from a congressional committee from Jon Thompson. The CIA and FBI aren't going to stop it, and they have a good reason to keep a close eye on the FBI, including any attempt to track an illegality."
842,23,8,Exactly. They aren't reporting on the financial stability of the private sector. There's no good reason to believe that this is all based on this.
843,24,8,I think the NSA is doing a great job of bringing down the NSA's own dicks.
844,29,8,"I'm glad you're having a good time today. It's been so hard for me to say this, but I just couldn't imagine how difficult it was for me to make it through all these comments. I have been reading a little, but it's been a very difficult week."
845,35,8,Clearly you don't like the racial/ethnic divide. Surely the oligarchs should not allow that.
846,46,8,"I'm a huge supporter of a conservative candidate, but I think you are missing the point."
847,3,8,The most interesting part of this is a comment on how the government is being treated by both parties.

I think the issue of how government works is very important in context."
862,22,8,I think the FBI needs to change their approach in the direction of pursuing such a thing.
