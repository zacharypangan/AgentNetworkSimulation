87,18,28,It seems like the FBI has not been able to implement the budget they had in mind and is not able to take into consideration.
88,22,28,">Do you like Trump? This is the most controversial thing to hear today from a congressional committee from Jon Thompson. The CIA and FBI aren't going to stop it, and they have a good reason to keep a close eye on the FBI, including any attempt to track an illegality."
