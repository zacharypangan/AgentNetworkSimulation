15,18,33,"yep! i don't care about the prices, but if you look into it you can see that the value to buy a new customs partnership is much cheaper than the original one. i would say so."
16,20,33,It could be that the company is already doing business with the democrats or republicans and a large portion of the money from a few republican congressmen in favor of the republicans and democrats in favor of a republican-backed republican party.

24,7,33,How was your conversation with Jon Thompson?
25,8,33,How many days do they talk about the Mueller report?
26,12,33,i agree that we need to look into how it would impact trump's reputation. what does this really mean for you? what does this mean for us as a nation? is this about you?
27,18,33,That is not what they say and not what they are doing with their current business model.
28,20,33,It's not like I was in the country that he's a millionaire. I'm in the country and it's not the same anymore as the USA.
29,22,33,i know what i'm reading about.
30,24,33,"I think the people reading this are being very irrational, and some people have made a lot of inflammatory and shitlike comments in the past, but some of them seem to be very unattractive and very elitist, with some of them really being a bit unintelligible and the rest is in a resentment towards that part of them. The snooping is still a big deal in my book, but the ones that I read and find hilarious are generally very important to the larger picture."
31,26,33,Are you sure there isn't any other possible conspiracy?
32,30,33,>Hooray! I've just read what you said here and I ain't wrong about the law... You've been a skeptic for a year? How much does your income from your dreams have risen?

38,12,33,"I think you’re just overreacting. I think that the NSA has a legitimate interest in making a fucking conspiracy against our country. I don’t think that’s possible, and i think that this is a matter of no confidence at all. It sounds like the intelligence community is doing everything imaginable, and I think it’s really easy to make a case against something like this."

41,22,33,"So, Jon Thompson, the person who made the most public comments in the thread, is now telling me that he believes there is a lot of potential for abuse and ejaculation in the u.s. Government, and that the Trump campaign isn't going to turn around and use this guy as a ploy to make it sound like Trump is a little too manipulative for a public opinion."
42,24,33,"How would someone else do this? What would they do if they were to do it, and what would they do if they were going to do it?"
43,26,33,"'My visions may actually become a reality there were plenty of guilty me i have had visions for over a year of waking up and turning my tv on and seeing arrests being made simultaneousl that gun on their nightstand began to get louder and louder some may have actually picked it up only to put it Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
44,30,33,"My question is, is the name of the person who ran the campaign that Trump took over the presidency? I have heard it's the FBI."
45,33,1,You don't think it's the best thing to do? It is the most important thing to do.
46,33,37,You don't think it's the best thing to do? It is the most important thing to do.
47,47,33,They are not denying the snooping and the'return on investment' (Return on Investment) being considered. They are not reporting on the financial stability of the private sector.
48,7,33,i've been to the hmrc before but haven't been in my sleep yet

52,20,33,"It is a lot like being a spy. That's why they have to be able to send a picture of a child to their children, if a law student is involved. The idea of a 'trump is a bad speller and there are no coincidencesso"
53,22,33,The most interesting part of the story is this:

55,26,33,"""I like your idea of what you think is important, but what you think is a little bit more important is that you should formally state what you are really thinking and why you think the president is being acting like a pawn for these govt agencies that have no business using the govt as a source of revenue. I am not a huge anti-govt fan but I am sure you are well aware that a large portion of the govt is in favor of this. """
56,30,33,Exactly. They aren't reporting on the financial stability of the private sector. There's no good reason to believe that this is all based on this.
57,33,1,"I’m a member of the Democratic Party and I do not see the same things as the other parties. The Democratic party is a party of some kind. Ultimately, it is their party that will be the target of the elections, and all of them will want to participate, but it will not. Ultimately, the party is not going to stand a chance, because it’s not going to happen. Regardless, what happens is that they will be involved in a massive conspiracy and that they will support it, and they will probably be the only one in the Democratic party."

59,47,33,"When the president comes down to it, I think that people will be resentful towards him and that is a liar. But then again, that is a liar. It's a liar."
60,7,33,'I just listened to this and I just had the thought that it is based on what the FBI found and the evidence which is based on what the prosecutors found and the investigation.'
61,8,33,"CANNOTANSWER - ""This is interesting information. Are you sure there isn't any other possible conspiracy?"""
62,12,33,Why would he be so sensitive?
63,18,33,It seems like the FBI has not been able to implement the budget they had in mind and is not able to take into consideration.
64,20,33,"""What do you think about the u.s. enforcing a similar contract with the FBI? Do you think the FBI is doing that at all?"""
65,22,33,">Do you like Trump? This is the most controversial thing to hear today from a congressional committee from Jon Thompson. The CIA and FBI aren't going to stop it, and they have a good reason to keep a close eye on the FBI, including any attempt to track an illegality."
66,24,33,I think the NSA is doing a great job of bringing down the NSA's own dicks.
67,26,33,The most interesting part of the story is this:
68,30,33,"I've just listened to an excerpt from an interview with the Trump campaign. I think it's important to keep track of everything that has been said or done, and to be sure. But for now I'm just trying to keep track of the facts in a way that's relevant to the discussion."
69,33,1,"I feel a huge resentment for [President Trump] because he's been so paranoid, and when I think about it as a politician he thinks he can get elected based on the best practices of his party."

72,7,33,Are you not a skeptic?

74,12,33,"I think the intelligence community has a legitimate interest in making a fucking conspiracy against our country. What's more, [Teen Talking Out](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbythugs) is very good. I think that the NSA is doing a great job of bringing down the hmrc's own dicks."
75,18,33,"I've been a skeptic for a year, so I’m very much hesitant to speak about this. But I really do think the issue of a remark about the government being so shady and unfair is something I don’t see being an easy solution to. I think the issue of how government works is very important in context."
76,20,33,I am very curious to know what the legal implications are for the president's decision to remove a british official.
77,22,33,I think the FBI needs to change their approach in the direction of pursuing such a thing.
78,24,33,"[Hey! I’m doing well! How are you? Because I’ve just read what you said here and I’m doing well! How are you? Because I love all the people who said that they are in the top 3 most controversial presidential candidates, and this thread demonstrates how they are a problem and not an option. I am not an expert, but I can say that I am one of those people."
79,26,33,This is interesting. It is a cliche:
80,30,33,There's a hr.org /r/raisedbythugs page.
81,33,1,"The first line is a little harsh, but it's a very simple thing. You're not being sarcastic. I'm saying this because you're in a place to be the worst, the best, and the worst, and that's why you're out of there."

83,47,33,"It is a ploy to get away with the President because the president isn't going to do anything to stop it. The president is making money for his own personal gains, not the government. The NSA and the CIA have no excuse for making a damn fool of himself and is going to rob him."
