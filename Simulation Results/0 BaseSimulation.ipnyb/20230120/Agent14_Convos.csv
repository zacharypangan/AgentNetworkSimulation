90,18,14,It seems like the FBI has not been able to implement the budget they had in mind and is not able to take into consideration.
91,20,14,"""What do you think about the u.s. enforcing a similar contract with the FBI? Do you think the FBI is doing that at all?"""
92,26,14,The most interesting part of the story is this:
93,31,14,"I'm not sure you understand what you're talking about here, but you said that the NSA should be doing the investigation as well, and that a report can be made to Congress and the U.S. Department of State about this. They should be investigating how the FBI did it."
