90,18,14,It seems like the FBI has not been able to implement the budget they had in mind and is not able to take into consideration.
91,20,14,"""What do you think about the u.s. enforcing a similar contract with the FBI? Do you think the FBI is doing that at all?"""
92,26,14,The most interesting part of the story is this:
93,31,14,"I'm not sure you understand what you're talking about here, but you said that the NSA should be doing the investigation as well, and that a report can be made to Congress and the U.S. Department of State about this. They should be investigating how the FBI did it."

95,37,14,"I like to say that, if you’re gonna take one chance to talk about your job, you should talk about your career goals. Its all going to be about what matters."
96,1,14,"I'm assuming that you're talking about the government's efforts in catching a rape and a conspiracy against people with ""psycho-psychology"" and what not?"

But I really do think the issue of a remark about the government being so shady and unfair is something I don’t see being an easy solution to.
