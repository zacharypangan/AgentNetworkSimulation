26,14,19,I don't have much to say about this.
27,19,49,"OP is asking about the possibility of a rewrite of the terms of the new customs partnership, which may involve a new tax law. It seems like the new customs partnership might actually be a good idea for bringing in the amendments to the New York Customs Rules."

36,21,19,>What do you think about the u.s. enforcing a similar contract with the FBI? Do you think the FBI is doing that at all?
37,26,19,"""I like your idea of what you think is important, but what you think is a little bit more important is that you should formally state what you are really thinking and why you think the president is being acting like a pawn for these govt agencies that have no business using the govt as a source of revenue. I am not a huge anti-govt fan but I am sure you are well aware that a large portion of the govt is in favor of this. """

45,26,19,The most interesting part of the story is this:
46,30,19,"I've just listened to an excerpt from an interview with the Trump campaign. I think it's important to keep track of everything that has been said or done, and to be sure. But for now I'm just trying to keep track of the facts in a way that's relevant to the discussion."
