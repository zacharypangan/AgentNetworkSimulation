33,22,20,"So, Jon Thompson, the person who made the most public comments in the thread, is now telling me that he believes there is a lot of potential for abuse and ejaculation in the u.s. Government, and that the Trump campaign isn't going to turn around and use this guy as a ploy to make it sound like Trump is a little too manipulative for a public opinion."
34,31,20,I can’t think of any way to keep track of the federal investigations.
35,37,20,"So many federal investigations and reviews, and it is the most controversial thing to hear today from a congressional committee from Jon Thompson."

41,21,20,>What do you think about the u.s. enforcing a similar contract with the FBI? Do you think the FBI is doing that at all?
42,22,20,The most interesting part of the story is this:
43,31,20,hmm... hmm...
44,37,20,"That is one of the most infamous phrases in the US lexicon, and is not a good analogy for the people involved."
45,18,20,It seems like the FBI has not been able to implement the budget they had in mind and is not able to take into consideration.

53,37,20,"I like to say that, if you’re gonna take one chance to talk about your job, you should talk about your career goals. Its all going to be about what matters."
54,18,20,"I've been a skeptic for a year, so I’m very much hesitant to speak about this. But I really do think the issue of a remark about the government being so shady and unfair is something I don’t see being an easy solution to. I think the issue of how government works is very important in context."
