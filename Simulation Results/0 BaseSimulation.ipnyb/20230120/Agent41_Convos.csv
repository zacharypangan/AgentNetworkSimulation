22,22,41,i know what i'm reading about.
23,24,41,"I think the people reading this are being very irrational, and some people have made a lot of inflammatory and shitlike comments in the past, but some of them seem to be very unattractive and very elitist, with some of them really being a bit unintelligible and the rest is in a resentment towards that part of them. The snooping is still a big deal in my book, but the ones that I read and find hilarious are generally very important to the larger picture."
24,29,41,Do you know where the most controversial thing to hear today from a congressional committee from Jon Thompson. Do you know where it was from?
25,30,41,>Hooray! I've just read what you said here and I ain't wrong about the law... You've been a skeptic for a year? How much does your income from your dreams have risen?

29,49,41,"When I worked at a big corporation, I was called a lobbyist. I went through a few of them and you can tell them it was a group that put pressure on the government. Apparently the FBI pressed me and she said ""I'm really tired of hearing this talk today and it's hard to keep track of how much he's worth."" The FBI went on to say that they would be able to help me with a case. The FBI is still trying to get him in touch with the public."

31,17,41,"How many people do you know who are in this sub? I mean, they only say that, and I have a bj with me, which is the point of this subreddit."
32,22,41,"So, Jon Thompson, the person who made the most public comments in the thread, is now telling me that he believes there is a lot of potential for abuse and ejaculation in the u.s. Government, and that the Trump campaign isn't going to turn around and use this guy as a ploy to make it sound like Trump is a little too manipulative for a public opinion."
33,24,41,"How would someone else do this? What would they do if they were to do it, and what would they do if they were going to do it?"
34,29,41,"Jon Thompson, who is a Republican, is a big red flag that the GOP is an obstructionist and that he's in trouble for stealing private property."
35,30,41,"My question is, is the name of the person who ran the campaign that Trump took over the presidency? I have heard it's the FBI."
36,41,5,"Jon Thompson explains that the ""[f) and [g] are not similar federal investigations and reviews."

40,16,41,So you've had visions for over a year of waking up and turning my tv on and seeing arrests being made simultaneouslyl thread kenneys take on safe injection sites is horribly misguided even in a vacuum as points out but i think that the president is examining the nature of the agreement trump signed with national archives.
41,17,41,I'm interested to know what the legal implications are for the president's decision to remove a british official.
42,22,41,The most interesting part of the story is this:
43,24,41,"'i am not sure what you mean by this. i am not sure what you mean by this. i am not sure what you mean by this. i'm not sure what you mean by this. i am not sure what you mean by this. i think that the intelligence community has a legitimate interest in making a fucking conspiracy against our country.

45,30,41,Exactly. They aren't reporting on the financial stability of the private sector. There's no good reason to believe that this is all based on this.

49,49,41,"As long as there's an ongoing restraining order, the FBI may be able to prosecute him, because the FBI is too scared of them."

53,24,41,I think the NSA is doing a great job of bringing down the NSA's own dicks.
54,29,41,"I'm glad you're having a good time today. It's been so hard for me to say this, but I just couldn't imagine how difficult it was for me to make it through all these comments. I have been reading a little, but it's been a very difficult week."
55,30,41,"I've just listened to an excerpt from an interview with the Trump campaign. I think it's important to keep track of everything that has been said or done, and to be sure. But for now I'm just trying to keep track of the facts in a way that's relevant to the discussion."

60,16,41,The first one has been really scary. What do you think about the'snooping is still a big deal in my book?
61,17,41,"It was the president who actually wrote a list of the top trump tweets on his own Facebook page. I believe this article is about how the FBI is putting together a fake government contract, and the president has stated that it's not going to be made public until further notice."
62,22,41,I think the FBI needs to change their approach in the direction of pursuing such a thing.
63,24,41,"[Hey! I’m doing well! How are you? Because I’ve just read what you said here and I’m doing well! How are you? Because I love all the people who said that they are in the top 3 most controversial presidential candidates, and this thread demonstrates how they are a problem and not an option.
