28,10,46,"Well, I'm very glad I found it, and I don't think I'd want to believe the gov't to do it, but my 'exhaustive' response to the news about what the gov't is doing is telling me that the gov't should go after them."

35,49,46,"When I worked at a big corporation, I was called a lobbyist. I went through a few of them and you can tell them it was a group that put pressure on the government. Apparently the FBI pressed me and she said ""I'm really tired of hearing this talk today and it's hard to keep track of how much he's worth."" The FBI went on to say that they would be able to help me with a case. The FBI is still trying to get him in touch with the public."
36,1,46,"That's an interesting fact that has to be included in the federal probe. If he had told you that, he probably knew what was going on."
37,4,46,This is one of the few times the post is in a negative thread about whether the US gov't is going to implement a budget that is currently up to the level that a conservative party will go through and it has a strong message.

64,10,46,"The president is making money for his own personal gains, not the government's. He is making money for the public interest, and he's trying to get away with it. He will have to do it on his own money for the government. But he's going to have to work hard to make that money."
65,15,46,It's not about why he's a hypocrite. It's about why the FBI is going after a fake government document. It's about how the US government can't really be trusted by the private sector without having an oversight role.
66,18,46,It seems like the FBI has not been able to implement the budget they had in mind and is not able to take into consideration.
