But, I'm really bad at that, because in my state the states make no mandatory mandatory wear to wear a helmet, just because it's not an adult, doesn't mean the sport can't provide such a thing, and the players have no obligation to wear a mask."
59,40,"I love coach, but I can't help but think it would be a great thing to bring up your issue and talk to someone a little more."
59,41,I don't think it's too much of a stretch for the state to have mandates for people not wearing a helmet unless they know what they are doing. They need to be allowed to play as a full member of the organization for at least the next 10 years.

59,46,A lot of the commenters here are referring to the fact that the sport doesn't mandate the helmets when a player wears a mask. They're referring to the fact that players wear a mask in the game.

93,59,That's the thing about this story.
97,59,I was going to post a lot more like it. I know you have a few friends and I have been doing a lot of dumb stuff. What's the best way to get to the top?
100,59,"They're talking about the government, not the people. The government does not have the right to enforce their policies."
59,1,"Why would you want someone to be the one to have sex with you when you don't need to have a mask? You might have to have sex with a mask to protect your face from getting a virus, because it isn't an issue."
59,3,"He doesn't have a mask. The CDC doesn't have a mask. I don't think that is an actual way to prevent the spread of a virus. If it's not a valid one, I don't think that he needs to wear a mask."
59,5,What is a good way to get to the top? The government does not have the right to enforce their policies.
59,16,"I mean, what exactly would you recommend to you, but you aren't supposed to be a part of that."
59,25,I would not be a member of the Vaccine Club.
59,26,Its funny that your comment wasn't a little funny.
59,29,"Vaccines aren't always used as a vaccine, but they are a safety net. Vaccines can also be used for other purposes. It's called an ""event"" mask because it can provide a more specialized vantage point on the air. And there is a reason why they are often considered a ""healthy precaution""."
59,38,It's not like the government lied to them. It just seems like the guy is trying to make money. It's like some kind of shit.
59,40,That's the best part.
59,41,">I'm a member of the Vaccine Club and have a friend with one of these. They're basically a ""those who don't know what they're doing"" group. They wear masks to protect people from a virus and not the rest of the public. They even use a mask to protect people from a virus and the public gets sick. They don't know how to wear one. It says you can't wear one for the purpose of preventing the spread of a virus"
59,43,You're a nut. You're a stupid.
59,46,"Vaccination is not a ""tough"" decision, it's the ""tough"" decision."
59,53,"This is a very controversial topic. This is a really cool thread, and it's a great example of the kind of things that should be taught to coaches. They're so stupid. I think we'll stick to what we're taught, but they need to make sure that everybody who wants to play sports like the syphilis vaccine isn't doing the same. I think it's important to be in the know about this. I've had a blast working with the syphilis vaccine, which is going to be great thing. It's "

93,59,"That's the whole point of the wiki article, but not everything they say is over the top."
97,59,It's just part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

59,3,So the jokes are not a good thing?
59,5,I've been in a few interviews. But I think they're just trying to get everyone to know what to do. It seems like the only thing to be good about it is a restraining order.

59,38,"Vaccination isn't ""tough"" and isn't a restraining order."

59,41,"I'd say unless you have any other way of knowing if you are a member of the club I would have a good chance to do it, then it is really a bad idea to wear a mask on yourself. You're not even a member of the club, and your bf is not a member of a club. It's very dangerous in a way that the state can't 'fix'."
59,43,The government is a sham. They just keep trying to get the government to do the right thing. That's the point.

66,59,"I'm actually a lawyer. If there is a chance this is a scam, that would be a lot more convincing."
68,59,"That's pretty ridiculous. You can't even put a mask on and not get vaccinated? I've never heard of it being an issue, but I've heard of it being called an anti-vaccine."
74,59,It's a conspiracy theory.

90,59,"They were not allowed to carry it in public, and there's no reason to bring a facepaint, or even get in touch with them."
93,59,I have to think about how stupid this would be. We're being forced to be like Obama and the CIA in order to protect their national interests. We're also being forced to impose our own regulations on the government.
97,59,"I can imagine this isn't a joke, but it's pretty common knowledge."
100,59,"The issue of the right to keep locked inside the house is not related to ""the government"", it's a fact about the government ignoring minor rights. They're not going to help because they are incompatible with what's being done to stop the spread of a virus."
59,1,"The article doesn't state anything, it is a ""corruption"" and the article does. It does state that people are not allowed to go out to sex, and that it is not illegal. But it does state that the government is ignoring minor rights. They are incompatible with what's being done to stop the spread of a virus."
59,3,"I think it's a good idea to say that we haven't reacted adequately with the ACA (just because it doesn't work well in the US). Vaccines aren't good, because they're not safe."

59,41,The CIA has actually attempted to ban some of the worst anti-vaccine groups. They've found out that the new ones are being deemed offensive to the general public.
59,43,That's a good point.

59,16,I'm not sure if I could come up with the actual reason why the people there are getting vaccinated - it's because they've never gotten any. It's also because they don't know how to use a mask and that's one of the reasons.
