88,82,That is very important. It seems to me like the wiki article you're referencing is full of false information about the government trying to stop the spread of a virus. You can also check out this link: http://www.wiki.com/wiki/The_Death_of_a_virgin_by_a_virus
88,86,"That’s what happened when people tried wearing a mask, it was a sign of a problem, it wasn’t a one time thing, but it wasn’t a big deal."
88,4,"I was a kid at a college where the police and teachers had to explain to students that wearing a mask in the hospital 'was a sign that someone was trying to cut you off and you would die in the hospital. I remember it being a good idea to do that as a kid to avoid it, but after reading the article, I felt like I was wasting my time."
88,16,I was the one that got me through this and made it home.

88,20,"This is the kind of thing that we're seeing all the time. There's a point in everything we're seeing - all the 'invasions'. It's pretty cool when they're real, and the 'hugs' are just a bunch of tiny little things - but you don't want to look like the masks because that's something we don't want to get in our heads."
88,31,"I want to be a realist, but I do believe this mask is part of a package containing all sorts of help that the government uses to help stop the spread of a virus."
88,34,This is a question I’m asked every day and every day.
88,36,"My friend got a hiccup from wearing a mask, and it was awful. He said that she could breathe for 2 minutes straight, but it took about 6 minutes if she did that. So we had a few months of work and the mask was on her face for months."

88,39,"I had a conversation in this thread a few weeks ago about how he'd talk to people like you and he felt the need to apologize and take the time to explain that the guy he was trying to talk to was having a hard time breathing.

The problem was, we could both get a new mask, but not one of them could ever wear a mask, and if he went in with another person, he'd not be in the situation he was in."

88,20,The problem isn't his mask... it's that people can't seem to breathe.
88,31,"As someone who hasn't been wearing a mask for a long time, I cannot really remember if it was a mask or a mask."
88,34,A lot of people do not want to talk about the virus. He needs a mask.

88,86,"Having been there to take his mask off and talk with him, it was a little confusing. I was just talking with my friends when they woke up when I was getting some of their sick in the same room as me."
88,4,"You can't blame him for a life of depravity. I don't get why people are so mad that they're only a few days into something and only want to talk about it. It's a very serious matter, but it's something the government is trying to do to help stop."
88,16,"This is not the best explanation. This isn't a question I'm asked. Rather, it's an answer to what a lot of people get upset about."

I think you're the kind of person who doesn't care about his health, or who is not interested in being treated, a person with a virus, or an infection, etc. The guy is a jerk for stating that he has a virus but he's not doing it, and he's trying to tell you that."
88,4,I'm pretty sure this guy is not a virus so he's not wearing a mask. He's just being really self destructive in that it's a bad idea for him to have one because he doesn't want to die. You have to ask him to stay sane but the first thing he does is shut up about it. I don't know whether he would have a virus with his mask if they hadn't come to it.
88,16,"I don't care whether or not the virus has been spread to another country or not, the way they are using the word ""viral"" is in itself misleading. They're saying that ""viral is a virus"" so there isn't a big distinction between a virus and a virus."

88,31,It is a virus. A virus. A mask.
88,34,A mask is a virus. A mask is a virus. A mask is a virus.
88,36,It sounds like the question is whether this guy will ever really get sick and that's really not the answer. And what will they do with his sickness when he gets sick?
88,38,That's the whole point of my post.
88,39,"I think the whole point of this article is that ""whatever you're saying is probably true, but it's not true. A mask is a virus."""
88,76,I think it is kind of an interesting thought in the end that the government hasn't been using the masks a lot lately and that people like to think of the world in a much more positive light than the actual environment.

88,19,It's pretty much what they're trying to do.
88,20,"The issue isn't about your mask, it's the fact that the virus is just a virus. The question is if that virus is any good?"
88,31,It's probably a virus. But it isn't a virus. A mask is a virus. A mask is a virus. It is a virus. It is not a virus.

88,36,Almost everyone knows the article:

88,39,"I have a feeling the government is using the words ""viral"", ""virus"" and ""Viscer"" in their articles."
88,76,I'm not a doctor.
88,82,"I'm really glad we're seeing this now, because I don't think the government is taking too much for granted."
88,86,The article makes no distinction between virus and non-virus because it doesn't seem to support the notion that they have a virus unless he knowingly tries to hide it. He's a jerk and that's the point of this post.
88,4,"I mean, as a guy who's got a sicker friend than most people, I would be able to tell it's not a virus because it's a virus, that means that if he's in a group, then he's a virus and you're not immune to it. I think it's the point of this post."
88,16,I think this is a pretty interesting and useful read.
88,19,"a virus, not a virus."
88,20,The article is misleading and seems to be using a very basic idea of how to handle people who are sick. You're not going to get an infection. He is going to get a virus.
88,31,I thought it was funny because when you're wearing a mask it helps you breathe and also helps the environment.
88,34,It's so easy to make a doctor's opinion but that's not what it's about.
88,36,"I think it's pretty dumb, but that he's trying to keep the perspective that ""he's a virus fan, but I don't have the tools for it"""
88,38,"""No, it's not a virus. The truth is, it's a virus."
88,39,"It is also a viral virus that can cause problems in people, such as a car virus. It is infected with a virus that is known to be fatal (like a car virus) and will infect people with the resulting virus."
88,76,I just want to say that this is a very good article. A lot of people don't like wearing masks.
88,82,"This isn't about the government but rather the gov't. This isn't about the gov't, this is about the gov't. This is about the gov't's attempt to prevent people from being sick and that's really why I don't care about this stuff."

88,86,Then he must have been infected with an infected virus and must have tried something else that was not effective.

88,16,He was a doctor and he did not tell you that it's not a virus. That's one of the most common illnesses to be a result of infection if it's not caught immediately.

88,76,What you're saying is that the problem with a mask is that people do not like wearing them and therefore can't feel sick enough to know the exact solution to it.
88,82,"He's a man, not a lawyer, and that's why he is the man with the mask. He's a man who lives with the people he lives with. A mask is a virus."

88,4,There is a very high chance of someone being infected by a virus.
88,16,"So, if he doesn't have a virus, what he is talking about is actually a virus, a virus that can cause a disease."
88,19,I think a lot of people can understand the concept of a virus.

88,16,"IANAL, but I have had a lot of trouble with the notion of a virus:"
88,19,A man who does not wear a mask to be infected with a virus is a virus.
88,20,"""We're seeing all the way. There's a point in everything we're seeing - all the 'invasions'. It's pretty cool when they're real, and the hugs are just a bunch of tiny little things - but you don't want to look like the masks because that's something we don't want to get in our heads."""
88,31,"""An infection is a virus, a virus is not a virus, a virus is not a virus. It is a virus, a virus is not a virus, a virus is not a virus. A virus is not a virus. A virus is not a virus. A virus is not a virus. A virus is not a virus. A virus is not a virus. A virus is not a virus. A virus is not a virus. A virus is not a virus."
88,34,"If I are a doctor, I would say if a person is infected with a virus, but not with a virus, then you can say it is not a virus. A virus is a virus. A virus is a virus."
88,36,"No No, isn't a virus. It isn't a virus. It isn't a virus. It isn't a virus. It isn't a virus. It isn't a virus. It isn't a virus. A virus isn't a virus. A virus isn't a virus. It isn't a virus. It isn't a virus. A virus isn't a virus."
88,38,I think this is a great piece of advice.
88,39,CANNOTANSWER:
88,76,"I don't think it's funny that the article is on the article's top of the thread, since it's not legal advice."
88,82,"This is the ""funny"" part of this... You're the one who hasn't read any of the other comments, ""I'm not sure what you mean."""
88,86,"I'm not saying it's a virus, but it's a virus, and not a virus."
88,4,I feel like the only way I can give advice to someone is to take them to a hospital and tell them to get their throats checked and no to get any kind of virus.
88,16,"People who don't like wearing a mask tend to go overboard and assume they are ""viral,"" and say that they are not actually infected by a virus, instead of a virus. They are likely just trying to mask the ""virus"" by not wearing a mask or exposing them to an agent preventing them from spreading and infecting others."
88,19,"I don't think the doctor is going to give much more context than the article says, or that he's just trying to explain a little more to the reader."
88,20,"""... The article is misleading and seems to be using a very basic idea of how to handle people who are sick."""
88,31,The article doesn't say what to say.
88,34,"I'm in Texas and a guy in a car with a virus who had a virus in his face. I've had multiple cases, but he was also diagnosed with a virus."
88,36,"The article actually says that it is not a virus, but a virus in itself. The title of the article doesn't say that a virus is a virus, but that it is a virus. It is a virus, which is the definition of a virus."
88,38,"a viral is a virus, that's not a virus, but a virus."
88,39,"I don't think it's funny that the article is on top of the thread, since it's not legal advice."
88,76,A virus is a virus is a virus is not a virus. A virus is not a virus. A virus is not a virus. A virus is not a virus.
88,82,"What's funny is that ""I don't have any clue where to find a doctor."
88,86,Is wearing a mask in public for people to not be aware of the potential for spreading a virus?
88,4,"There is a huge misconception that the government is trying to help him, in fact it is helping him get out of a situation where he is infected. It sounds like he is being manipulated and wants to get rid of his mask to stop it, because he has the resources to help him, but they aren't."
88,16,There is a viral / mucus virus.
88,19,"In a way, I would never take that type of position. My doctor didn't want to tell me I'm the only one who gets it. He'd say, ""I'm sorry, but I can't even make it out of the Is the word I'm saying"", and I'd probably be the first to say, ""I feel like I'm the last one who will get it."""
88,20,>He told me she was being treated like an idiot. She told me she was being treated like an idiot.
88,31,A virus is a virus. A virus is a virus. A virus is a virus. A virus is not a virus. A virus is a virus. A virus is not a virus. A virus is not a virus.
88,34,I'm a lawyer and a lawyer at a health clinic.
88,36,I don't think this is a great place for you to go. This is a lot like the 'I don't want to be a virus' thing. This is a great place to tell the truth.
88,38,"The title implies that they do not need to get a virus to live, but that they do not have to wear a mask to live, and this is why they wear it. A virus does not have to be a virus, but it has to be a virus. A virus is not a virus."
88,39,>I'm a doctor and I'm a lawyer
88,76,"If a virus is a virus, it is not a virus. A virus is not a virus."
88,82,i.e. if I were a thief i would not wear a mask for a virus but i don't have the time. I don't know why.
88,86,"I would probably have the same problem without a mask, a virus, a virus, a virus, a virus, etc. He's just being a jerk, not a good guy."
88,4,"A virus is not a virus. A virus is a virus, but it is not a virus. A virus is not a virus. A virus is not a virus. The article is misleading. It doesn’t say what to say. It is a virus. A virus is not a virus. It is not a virus. A virus is not a virus. A virus is not a virus. A virus is not a virus."
88,16,I am not sure how to interpret a mask of a virus as a virus because I am not sure what the definition of a virus is.
88,19,Then why don't you get a quote that says that 'a bit of a stretch if I remember correctly'?
88,20,"If you're a lawyer, you should know how to explain it. This is a lot of nonsense and a lot of misleading. The article was a bit of a bit misleading. Basically, a ""machete"" is a hivemind's definition of a virus, which is a virus, in itself. The title implies that a virus is a virus, which is the definition of a virus, which is the definition of a virus, which is not a virus."
88,31,CANNOTANSWER:
88,34,"I was an e-cologist for 6 years, had a virus in my mouth. My rash was actually a result of my use of a mask to work a job that would not allow my husband to work as a ER physician."
88,36,"-('I think the whole point of this article is that ""I think it's really funny. Probably because of what the guy is trying to say. There are a lot of people in the world who wear a mask to prevent the spread of a virus."""
88,38,I think the article is hilarious and not funny. It’s a good article and has a great sense of humor. It’s not about the actual subject matter. It’s about the real issue. I think it’s very interesting.
88,39,"That's a lot of people being in the wrong here. It's really a good thing that you aren't going to get a lawyer. This is like a sign of desperation, isn't it."
88,76,I would not wear a mask without the mask. I would also not wear a mask with the virus as it has the chance to spread into my heart and body.
88,82,"''Mom, I've been in a mask for almost five years and a virus in my face is spreading. I have an infection and I have no idea what it is or how it's spreading, but it just isn't a virus'''."
88,86,"As a person who's been through a lot of medical procedures and hasn't had a virus in 20 years, I've seen multiple people in a fight, who were infected with it. A doctor in China will have to do a lot more research before he can be effective at stopping it."
88,4,I want to get a vaccine before it is too late.
88,16,Is there a virus or virus that can actually make you sick?
88,19,And a few others. The first two are not the most obvious nonsense I've heard from any lawyer but the first three are the most important.
88,20,"I would wear a mask, I wouldn't say I am a lawyer, I would just say I do."
88,31,"If I were a doctor and I'm a lawyer, I would think I would be in a virus."
88,34,"And if you're not sure what to put in a mask, you'll be too busy arguing about what the word virus means in a lot of different ways. Having an illness is a terrible idea, and you aren't really supposed to be in an ER, as there isn't any doctor or ER, you can wear a mask, or at least not for that matter."
88,36,"CANNOTANSWER: ""It is not a virus. A virus is not a virus. A virus is not a virus. A virus is not a virus."
88,38,"A virus is a virus, the term of a virus that is not a virus and the definition of a virus, but a virus isn't a virus."
88,39,CANNOTANSWER:
88,76,"IANAL, BUT HE’S BEEN WINDING A MADE MEKAL A PART OF THE MATTERS OF THE MADE MECKAL"
88,82,"CANNOTANSWER: ""I'm a doctor and I'm a medical practitioner. I've been wearing a mask for almost five years and a virus in my face is spreading."""
88,86,"You're being a jerk and I'm not talking about the article, but just being a jerk and trying to explain that the article makes no distinction between a virus and a virus."
88,4,The first of these three lines is just too obvious. It's a good point.
88,16,You should check out [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Vesicle-Vesicle-Vesicle-Vesicle-Vesicle-Vesicle-Vesicle-Vesicle-Vesicle-Vesicle-Vesicle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vesicle-Vesicle-VesicleVesicular
88,19,"He wrote an article about the virus, and this is why we're seeing it all the time."
88,20,"> ""The question is if that virus isn't a virus. A mask is not a virus, which is the definition of a virus, which is the definition of a virus, which is not a virus."""
88,31,The word's a twitch.
88,34,CANNOTANSWER:
88,36,"The first three aren't important, unless you are going to ask them to be'my favorite'."
88,38,I don't see anything wrong with the article.
88,39,OP is not in a court and I am not a lawyer
88,76,"I’m sure that the guy is trying to sabotage the government, since he hasn’t tried any of these in the past."
88,82,"CANNOTANSWER: ''The only one of me I can think of that was he was really interested in the virus and they didn’t want to put it in my face.""’’"
88,86,You don't see how the virus is a virus and you aren't sure what the difference is.
88,4,CANNOTANSWER:
88,16,">""Are you aware that I am not a virus. It is not a virus. The truth is, it is a virus. A mask is a virus. It isn't a virus."
88,19,"Yes, I would be the first to tell someone to stop having a mask because of the possibility of a virus."
88,20,r/legaladvice/ has a great article that addresses all of these problems.
88,31,I would probably be in a virus. I wouldn't.
88,34,It seems like this article is being misused by people on the internet. 'Some people want to keep a positive outlook on the world'
88,36,It was not a virus. It was a virus. It was a virus. And it was a virus. And the first line is just too obvious.
88,38,"I know that's the most difficult one to get rid of. But I don't think I could make much of a point on the topic of ""a virus and a virus. I don't think there is anything wrong with it"" or ""the other thing."""
88,39,"I don't think he's a lawyer and I'm not in a court - I don't think there's anything to be said - to make a point, but I do think it's a good thing that he's not in a court - he's not in a court - he's a doctor and not a lawyer. He may or may not want to be a lawyer in general - but he doesn't know the facts of the facts on the case"
88,76,"OP is not in a court and is not a lawyer, I'm sure that the guy is trying to sabotage the government, since he hasn't tried any of these in the past."
88,82,"“““My mother has an infection and I need to get a mask. I’m in a wheelchair, and I’ve had trouble breathing, and I couldn’t really breathe in a room without a mask.””"
88,86,"A virus is a virus, and not a virus. A virus is a virus."
88,4,"> I mean, as a guy who's got a sicker friend than most people, I would be able to tell it's not a virus, because it's not a virus. It is not a virus. A mask is not a virus, but it is not a virus."
88,16,"'As a doctor and not a lawyer, I can tell you that if I were a doctor, I wouldn't wear a mask because I can't see the actual virus,'"
88,19,"I don't think he's going to take a side from the other statements he made about the fact that he is a doctor, that he does not think he is a virus."
88,20,r/legaladvice is a good resource for people who want to talk about viruses
88,31,This is a pretty clear-cut ripoff.
88,34,"It's probably the most obvious thing I've ever read, because I feel like the article is being misused."
88,36,The article says that it is not a virus. It isn't a virus. The title doesn't say that it is a virus. It isn't a virus. A mask is a virus.
88,38,So the article isn't a virus. The article is a virus.
88,39,"I'm a lawyer, and I also do not understand why the EPA is using this as the word ""vaccine"" to make this article about the government."
88,76,"They are also referred to as ""semen"". It is known as ""semen"" and means ""semen"" and ""semen"". This is an ingenious term that's used to mean sexes and people with different kinds of skin and hair, as well as people with different skin and hair colours and hair and such."
88,82,It sounds like the two of them were really connected.
88,86,So is the phrase 'Twitch' used by a person in the medical field as 'viruses'?
88,4,"I don't think anyone is going to be able to tell you something, but I think it's pretty easy to just accept the statement you made in your post."
88,16,"It is a virus. A virus isn't a virus, it's a virus. The virus is not a virus. If you have a virus, it doesn't contain viruses. There is no virus, and if you aren't sick, it's no virus. You can't have a virus because you can't be sick. You can only get sick, if you don't have it. It's not a virus. A virus can cause a virus, and you don't necessarily have to wear it."
88,19,[NAME] is a virus.
88,20,It is a virus because it doesn't affect the person he's with. It's not a virus because he can't breathe. It is not a virus because he cannot breathe. It is not a virus because he can't breath.
88,31,"As a Doctor, I can tell you that it sounds like the other two people had a've got a fetus' ('Velocibus and Trichlorella')."
88,34,So I figured I would tell the guy that there is no other type of virus on the planet.
88,36,"I'm a lawyer. I've had a hiccup, I have a bad headache and it is not a virus. A lot of people, I'm a nurse, wear a mask and I can't believe it. I've been in a different hospital. I got a hiccup, I didn't even think to ask if it was a virus. The doctor did not even know what it was, so he couldn't tell me what I think to myself."
88,38,'What is the point of my post?'
88,39,"> It's not a virus, it is a virus."
88,76,It’s an ad hominem that is so funny that I can’t even even comprehend the idea of the phrase.
88,82,i'm not a lawyer
88,86,"... which means ""infecting people who haven't had a virus""?"
