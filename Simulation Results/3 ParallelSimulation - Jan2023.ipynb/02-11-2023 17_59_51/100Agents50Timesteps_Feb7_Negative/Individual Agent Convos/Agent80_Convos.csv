80,2,"This is pretty standard here, they don't wear a mask. It's just that they're a huge joke to be able to do so. You just need to wear a mask and see that it's a big part of the game, and your players won't resign unless you want to play against them or if you want a good helmet."
80,9,"I have a very short answer i was wondering, but i have a mask that i wear often that is not wearing properly under a helmet."

I don't know how long I can wait to get that guy resigned if I wear a mask because he's not the kind of coach that does a great job, I just want him to stop and move on.

80,28,I've had a LOT of injuries that resulted in me resigning. It's really annoying. I got a ton of pain. But i have to get out of the stadium. My teammate is a jerk and if he is a bit in a hurry and not wearing a mask or wearing a helmet then it's no fun.

80,41,It's like a mask that doesn't actually work well - the people who actually need to wear it wear them. I haven't even tried it but I think it fits.

80,54,"I used to work at the national hockey team in NYC and when I was there, I saw these little blue ones and I started wearing them. They are so great that you can get a new one for your team."
80,58,I don't know what else I can do but we aren't sure what a good deal of the government in our country would do if we weren't able to wear masks for the duration of the game.

80,67,"I'm not that joking, but i don't care about the safety. I feel like my body looks like a shit. I get tired of wearing masks when i work and then they wear a lot of them to wear as the weather gets colder, because of the lack of wind. I'm a guy but I don't think i've ever seen the same thing happen. It makes my lungs hurt and my face hurt."
80,74,The players in the video are able to do this if they are under the bus. Getting the helmet and helmets is much better.

The person you want to be the one to make the switch is the troll. It's not your job to stop this from happening.
80,54,I figured out how to get a CDC report after I rubbed my head in it. I don't want to have to go through the CDC's website to report it.
80,58,That is a restraining order. I just can't stand that kind of guy.

80,2,'Made in NYC' is actually a word used to refer to a CDC article.

80,66,"Yes, I feel like there is a lot of nonsense in the title. I don't care what other people think about the joke."
80,67,"""Weeding a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.''"
80,74,CDC has a number of rules and regulations. It's illegal for the federal government to let the CDC handle the problem for a certain amount of people. And it's not even a joke.
80,79,Vaccination is the best way to prevent the spread of a virus. It is basically a way to protect your own health.
92,80,"So the narrator says, ""If you're allergic to a virus, and he's infected, then your reaction should be the same as the joke he said about the sprite. He asked him to take off his mask to stop the spread of the dredge because he wasn't that sick, and then told his friend to have a prank?"

80,2,I can’t see any reason why people are saying something stupid like this.
80,9,The CDC has a number of rules and regulations. It's illegal for the federal government to let the CDC handle the problem for a certain amount of people.

80,25,There are two parts to this one.
80,28,CDC has a number of rules and regulations. It's illegal for the federal government to let the CDC handle the problem for a certain amount of people. It's not even a joke.
80,36,"I would also like to give my support to the government, and I am sure that they don't want to be the ones responsible for protecting children."
80,41,I think the CDC needs to be informed about this and it's the reason they're trying to force people to wear a mask.
80,44,It's not funny. And not funny.
80,54,What is the best way to protect your own health?
80,58,It seems like the CDC's actions and stance are sexist.
80,66,I think it's pretty fair to assume the person is referring to the CDC as the government of the world.
80,67,"I think the best advice people have here is to ask the question, ""When a politician is asking to stop the spread of a virus a joke?"""
80,74,People bringing shit on someone is a good way to prevent the spread of the virus.

101,80,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
80,2,"I don't think the CDC really cares that much about the health of their patients when they're sick or ill. Vaccination is the only thing they're doing to keep their patients safe. The vaccines they are recommending are not effective against the whole ""hobbie virus"" thing. Those things will not be able to be vaccinated against. The public health organizations will never stop taking them seriously. Vaccination is a good thing to prevent."
80,9,It's one of the best jokes I've ever heard.
80,11,I think it's appropriate that people on this sub be honest about this. A good CDC employee is a liar who refuses to listen to the CDC when it comes to getting a good vaccination.
80,13,The title he's referring to is a joke. And that's why the CDC has a number of rules and regulations. They are the only authority to keep people safe.

This is about how to make the world a better place for people and how to avoid sick people and people being sick. Vaccination is not a joke. You can't get that from any other health care provider. This is also not a joke about a doctor.

80,41,I think you are being wrong because the people of the country are being a prankster.
80,44,That's a very good point. But in my opinion the best way to stop the spread of HIV is to vaccinate people in the US. I'd rather have a job of a doctor.

The article is clearly not a joke, but it is one of the things I’m thinking of, the CDC has been able to do in the past and the whole organization is attempting to stop the spread of a virus. There is no real way to stop it. The CDC is being sexist. They’re telling the CDC that it’s a joke. It’s about the CDC. It’s not about the CDC. It’s about preventing the spread of a virus."
80,13,That's a good point.
80,20,I have no idea what this is about.

80,22,Vaccination is the best way to prevent the spread of a virus. There is no joke about this.
80,24,So... it goes some way.
80,25,The joke is actually about not wanting a vaccine in the first place because he said that they wouldn’t get it. The fact that it doesn’t protect anyone at all is an indication that they’re being a joke and that they’re trying to get people to wear masks. It’s not like a joke when people are just petty and making fun of people who aren’t vaccinated.

80,54,What about the guy that's not a doctor?
80,58,"I think the first thing you're going to say is blatantly inane here. I think the article is being deleted because of the word ""failures""?"
80,66,So... what's that? I'm not even sure what you mean by that...
80,67,"It's a joke, but they're promoting the government's agenda."
80,74,"Assuming he’s not referring to the viral spread of the virus, it is not a joke. If that is the case, it isn’t a joke."

92,80,"I love 'Pick up'. I've never heard a prank like that on here before and always wanted to try it out but hey there's something else out there that makes me laugh, 'Pick up'."

80,54,[This is an incredibly short article].
80,58,"""If you want to see if a player is sick and vaccinated then you have to ask their doctor."
80,66,I'd get off my head and leave the joke on the internet. I don't think people are in a position to be concerned about this a lot.
80,67,Is this a joke?
