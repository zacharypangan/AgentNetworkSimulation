77,7,I'm afraid this is the sort of thing where you're expected to wear a mask every day and a slack-free night of work.
77,8,"I'm not sure this would even work, but if he is wearing it and you're inhaling smoke while wearing a mask and you are getting an alert that you are leaking a virus that hasn't spread into the air yet, he's not gonna take any action to stop it."
77,16,The first time I had a mask I just remembered that I had been exposed to a virus.

77,30,"They’re not saying it is OK to not wear a mask, but it’s pretty naive that people do."
77,32,"YES! I lost a mask at least four times a day, but it only works if I'm not in the same room as the person who's wearing it."
77,35,Ingraham is doing the same thing he is doing to stop a virus from enfecting others. This has been the case for a long time.
77,36,So what happens if you wear a mask? Does it work?
77,39,"It's a good way to save yourself from an infection, so if it's on your skin it's not just going to spread."
77,41,"Those pathetic clowns on the internet can do better than me. I can see why they are doing it. They are trying to steal and sell these things to everyone, and now it's the government's fault for using them."

77,56,"I'm so sick of those stupid shittiest things on the planet. I'm sick of the people who aren't aware of their own actions, not knowing their own actions or how to properly handle them. I'm sick of the shittiest things on the planet. I can't take them seriously."
77,58,I lost my mask when I was a teenager. I would make fun of the people who I was with.
77,60,I don't want to know if the one I wore died or if it had been a victim.
77,62,"As a former CIA agent, the FBI uses a narcotics detection device to prevent the spread of a virus. I don't think there's any evidence of this being a scam."

77,28,"I don't really know why you are getting downvoted, I'm not a big fan of any of the things people have said, but I can tell you that there are things that are a scam."
77,30,I like to laugh at the people that do this. I feel like I am a dick because I have no idea what they are talking about. They don't want to talk about this.
77,32,No it doesn't work. You're going to have to be in the same room as the person who's wearing it.
77,35,"I'm a naive apologist, but I've heard that ""the government does not have authority to wear a mask."""

77,62,"Is this a good thing? I lost my mask a few years ago and it still is, I'm in my 50s. I've never had it on me. I feel like my health has been threatened. I've had to replace it. This was before I was even a teen. It was a good thing I had a good one in college."
77,66,"There's one guy who did this on a joke show about it. He lost a mask and stayed the night, and said I lost the same mask. He didn't."
77,72,"It's really not a scam, its a scam to sell a lot of things, so it's a lot of things."
77,76,"If you're a criminal that's a criminal. You might be a little naive to think that you're a fraud, but that doesn't mean that your actions are inherently evil."

77,8,"The people who do this are idiots, but most of the scammers don't even try. They simply have a bad idea of their own. Regardless of the truths you're using."
77,16,Yes. You're a fraud. There's a lot of lies around the fact that the government doesn't have authority to wear a mask.
77,22,"I like to make a remark on a website that talks about how people have been on the Internet for the last 10 years that say ""I have to wear a mask for a period of time"" but not on a site that says ""I'm not going to get a real job."""
77,23,"[Although, I lost a mask because I didn't know the word at all. I have to use my hands a lot. I know it's a scam. It's a scam."
77,26,I was a CIA agent and I lost a mask at least four times a day. I lost a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam.
77,28,I've heard that wearing a mask on your neck can help to prevent infections of some kinds. The only other way I know that it is a scam is if you wear a mask to keep yourself safe.
77,30,"They're not saying it's OK to not wear a mask, but it's pretty naive that people do."

77,36,i lost a mask at least 4 times a day
77,39,I've lost a mask a few times a day. It is a good way to save myself from an infection.
77,41,"You are a scam. Your first post in this thread, essentially the same as my comment."
77,46,"It's a scam to send your victims, not your mask, to the CIA, and the government, without any specific facts."
77,53,"This isn't a scam, scumbags."
77,56,"I don't think a good one to the people who do that can be a scam, but I also think the situation is not a scam."
77,58,"I've never heard of this, and I don't think I've heard of any other person that did this."
77,60,"They are the ones that need to be protected. I don't see how anyone could say anything like, ""Have you ever seen the mask on yourself? I didn't know that it was a mask and I don't need to find out that it wasn't a mask."" but that's the part where the victim is being used as a means of a warning."
77,62,"As a former CIA agent, I find it really disturbing that a government contractor uses a narcotics detection device to prevent the spread of a virus. I wonder what kind of narcotics they use and why they use them? What kind of drug does a mask say?"
77,66,I lost my first mask in school and was a huge scumbag.
77,72,"I'm a CIA agent, and I lost a mask about four times a day for the first time. I lost a mask about three times a day because I didn't know what a NSA scanner looked like."
77,76,"It's not just a scam. It's a scam, and is a lot different from the other examples I've heard."
85,77,My husband had a mask on when he was young - he got one in the mail from the CDC when he was in school to be able to see his family. It wasn't a mask. He had a long necklace that he could just slap on.
100,77,The FBI released an article in 2006 claiming she was in an infection with an arachnovirus.
77,4,"As an agent in the CIA, I have never heard of the concept of wearing a mask because I don't know what it says."
77,7,"""Narcotics detection device"" is a term that's used by the government to prevent spread of a virus. Wearing a mask can help to prevent infections of some kinds. The only other way I know that it is a scam is if you wear a mask to keep yourself safe."
77,8,"I would rather have someone just be more suspicious than to hear the exact words of the guy, a CIA agent, that was a CIA agent, who is not even on the CIA team and was a CIA agent."
77,16,"I lost a mask when I was a CIA agent, it was a mask that I had never worn on my face and was worn on my head a lot. I was still wearing it on, and it was the most infuriating thing ever."
77,22,I just found out this week that I have lost a mask.
77,23,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
77,26,"I lost a mask once to my daughter, but I didn't have it to eat her, so I had to wear it every day."
77,28,I've been a CIA agent and I had my mask on for about a week and it was a nice and useful protective tool I used to protect myself from being contaminated. It made me wonder if the person who got it was really bad or just a dick.
77,30,This is why people get more insecure about going through a CDC scanner.
77,32,I was in high school when my dad would wear his mask to school. After that he said he didn't want to get in the way of the victim of the infection. We just wore them and we couldn't get back out of the way.
77,35,> I lost a mask because I didn't know the word at all. I have to use my hands a lot. I know it's a scam.
77,36,"""I lost a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam. I've heard that wearing a mask on your neck can help to prevent infections of some kinds. The only other way I know that it is a scam is if you wear a mask to keep yourself safe. They're not saying it's OK to not wear a mask, but it's pretty naive that people do. That's not just a scam. It's a scam, and is a scam."
77,39,This is an example of a legitimate fraud that will eventually escalate.
77,41,I had a friend who lost his mother's mask to the CIA. She didn't know about it because she didn't know what it was.
77,46,I lost my mask because I had no idea what I was doing and I was in a serious state of shock. I think this is all about the truth and being honest with others. This is what it says.
77,53,"I've read it twice, and I'm not sure what its called, but you're a liar."
77,56,It's not a scam. It's a good way to protect yourself.
77,58,">They're not saying it's OK to not wear a mask, but it's pretty naive that people do. That's not a good thing, but the real thing is that you need to do the same thing."
77,60,"I read that on a TV show that had a CDC article that claimed she was infected with arachnovirus, but had no clue what it was."
77,62,This is not a scam.
77,66,"As an agent and former CIA agent, I can say that this is a scam. A bit like you. Unless you have a job at a CIA Agency, it's a scam."
77,72,I know this. I'm sure the government has seen this before.
77,76,I lost my first mask when I was a kid.
85,77,"Apparently this has been covered in a book titled, The Devil Wears a Mask, which is an excellent documentary."
100,77,The first comment in the thread is really about what Obama's policies are being twisted towards minors. What he says is wrong.
77,4,"It's not a scam, and it's a scam."
77,7,"I'm an agent and former CIA agent, I can say that this is a scam. A bit like you. Unless you have a job at a CIA Agency, it's a scam."
77,8,"i lost a mask once to my daughter, but I didn't have it to eat her, so I had to wear it every day. I've been a CIA agent and I had my mask on for about a week and it was a nice and useful protective tool I used to protect myself from being contaminated. It made me wonder if the person who got it was really bad or just a dick."
77,16,Honestly this is one of those questions that i will never forget. I think this is really a pathetic post because this whole thing is so sad.
77,22,"It is very true that many a liar have a lot of shit to worry about, but I think the real thing is a bit more interesting to have in the future."
77,23,"As an agent and former CIA agent, I can say that this is a scam. I'm sure the government has seen this before."
77,26,This is a really good one. I'm not even talking about your daughter's mask.
77,28,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
77,30,"The Devil Wears a Mask, a film about how he was caught, has pretty good apocalypse footage."
77,32,"I would wear a mask every day, especially in the case of an infection. But I'd get my hands on them all day long."
77,35,I'm a doctor who works for the FDA.
77,36,"That's just a shit list to list, but to have the proper words is probably the same as a lot of people that are in a position where I'm not worried about that."
77,39,The CDC is a fraud but the government itself is a scam so this could have to be the prevailing story.
77,41,"""I lost a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. I lost a mask once to my daughter, but I didn't have it to eat her, so I had to wear it every day."""
77,46,"I have a friend who lost his mother's mask to the CIA. He lost her as a baby and her mom was bitten, and then went to the CIA."
77,53,"I am shocked that a CDC cover-up is the most likely explanation. It's not like they really care about the person, it's just that it's a great way to stop the spread of the virus."
77,56,"I've seen a lot of people have this question. The US Government has no mandate for public exposure to the public, and if people aren't aware of what their masks can or can't do, they're not aware of it. The government has no legal obligation to cover up its actions. They're not even gonna tell you what you can and cannot do unless you're shady enough to say so. It's not really a scam."
77,58,You just read something. You didn't read it and were a little confused.
77,60,This isn't the same as getting your ear broken off or infected by a CIA scanner. It's the same as using a mask to stop the spread of a virus.
77,62,I haven't seen this article. But it sounds like someone just used a mask to protect me from a virus that was on their mother's body.
77,66,I had to wear a mask for about a week because it was a nice and useful protective tool I used to protect myself from getting infected. It made me wonder if the person who got it was really bad or just a dick.
77,72,I'm a CIA agent and I've lost my first mask when I was a kid.
77,76,I read the book The Devil Wears a Mask. I am very sorry for the loss.
85,77,"I mean, this is a lot of stuff."
100,77,"""The world is an utterly fucked up place and it's very difficult to keep our heads together on the subject."""
77,4,There is a story in this thread about a CIA agent who got infected in a very big hospital with a fecal virus. I'm sorry to hear that.
77,7,"""This is the sort of thing where you're expected to wear a mask every day and a slack-free night of work."""
77,8,"So, how was your daughter being infected? You are not supposed to take the virus and it spreads into your body."
77,16,"The government does have a mandate to cover things up, but the CIA knowingly does not."
77,22,"We aren't going to see the same stories in the NSA, but it's likely that the FBI, the CIA, the CIA and the FBI lied and then it has no legal obligation to tell you what to do."
77,23,"""Hey man, it's hard to be honest but I've lost my mom's mask. I'll always forget about it, but I've learned that he's not very good at it."""
77,26,"""I lost my mask at least four times a day. I lost a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam. I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam."""
77,28,"I’m gonna go ahead and downvote you. I mean, I was a CIA agent, so I didn’t know why I couldn’t get one."
77,30,What is the title of the book about the CIA? I had to use the movie to read the article.
77,32,"It's a scam. It's more like ""I lost a mask at least four times a day, but it only works if I'm not in the same room as the person who's wearing it."""
77,35,"You lost a mask? I can't find the article, but I read it and I lost my first one and thought it was just a scam."
77,36,"I think that you're being serious. You haven't read the book The Devil Wears a Mask. You're a kid. I read this book as a child and thought it was interesting, but you're not saying a person who was infected was a dick."
77,39,In this case the government is responsible for keeping people safe by putting a mask on.
77,41,"I don't know about what the first sentence means, but I can say that this whole thing is a scam."
77,46,"I had a friend who lost his mother's mask because the CIA said they had a falsehood that the child was infected by a virus. The mother went and sued them in federal court for that. The mask blew up. The CIA had a falsehood, and it was the CIA who caught him."
77,53,"""The world is an utterly fucked up place and it's very difficult to keep our heads together on the subject."""
77,56,"Despite the fact that it's probably a scam, it's very unlikely that there is some kind of fraud going on."
77,58,a fucking dick
77,60,"It sounds like the CIA was using the CDC's ""safety measure"" as the excuse to say they aren't willing to cover up anything. It's a scam, but it's not like they've been on the side of a scam before."
77,62,"Is the author saying, ""Hey, if you don't know, you might wanna go with the police""."
77,66,"The CDC has no mandate for public exposure to the public, and if people aren't aware of what their masks can or can't do, they're not aware of it."
77,72,CIA agents do not wear masks when a person is sick. They wear masks to protect themselves. They wear masks to protect themselves and others.
77,76,"I know it sounds crazy but I do not really think the word ""scam"" would apply to this article."
85,77,"OP, you're making a really good point there."
100,77,"The FBI has been going to the White House and is saying they will help with the issue, and this is something that will likely be a big issue in some contexts."
77,4,"I’m a CIA agent that used to work for a hospital, it was a scam. We got the information to the hospital."
77,7,I have a narcotics detection device that can help prevent spread of a virus and that works for me.
77,8,You're not being serious. Your story is just as valid as the book the Devil Wears a Mask
77,16,"The problem is they have a very clear definition of ""scam"" for a reason. And I think that the idea of ""scam"" is so good that it isn't a serious issue in that it's a ""fucking ""issue"" of ""a scam""."
77,22,"The article was from 2009 and says it's been a good year for NSA and CIA spies on the public. In fact, I've read it a lot now and it's pretty damn interesting that there's been a lot of stories in the NSA."
77,23,I'm a CIA agent and I'm sure the CIA has seen this before.
77,26,I think the CIA is not going to fix the problem.
77,28,The CDC doesn't actually have any mandate for public exposure to the public.
77,30,This has all been described a lot in this thread. I'm not sure you're saying the CDC isn't responsible for the spread of the virus because they don't wear a mask to protect you but because they don't want to lie and they can't hide a fact when someone else is exposed to a virus in order to spread it.
77,32,I'm just a young person with a very bad brain. A lot of people do not have a good brain.
77,35,A lot of people who believe that they're not aware of what they're wearing have become aware of what they're doing.
77,36,> Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus
77,39,"So, what does this mean? I mean, it sounds like a scam to me. I think you’re doing the right thing."
77,41,And I can't stop reading this post.
77,46,"I was just reading this book. It was very good. I read it and thought it was funny, but you couldn't know what the book meant. It is a scam to do what is a scam and send someone else out, and it sounds like they are scamming."
77,53,It's not like there's any kind of legal protection or censorship against the government that doesn't allow the government to put up with this.
77,56,My friend lost his mother's mask because of a falsehood. I lost my mother's mask and she went and sued them in federal court for that. She is now a fucking shady teenager who lied. She was an adult.
77,58,"This is a good thing, not a good thing."
77,60,"The CIA is involved in helping spread the virus, which is why they would put on a mask. Then they could make it worse by hiding the virus and taking the victim to a hospital with a biopsy."
77,62,"...i mean, i lost my mom's mask. i'll always forget about it, but i've learned that he's not very good at it."

""The world is an utterly fucked up place and it's very difficult to keep our heads together on the subject."""
77,4,And a little bit of this is just a scam to say the least.
77,7,This is an easy scam because you’re a CIA agent. You’re just an agent.
77,8,I just want to say this:
77,16,"So, if you are a CIA agent that was exposed to a virus, and that you have a mask you lost, then the CIA isn't responsible for the spread of the virus. (I don't believe 'a'is wrong in the general sense of the word but still wrong.) So you should talk to the president and you will talk to him about it."
77,22,"I'm an ocitian, I've lied and lied and lied and lied, but I didn't do the right thing."
77,23,I'm not sure if you really believe what this is. What was the point of the article? Was it a statement that he was just an agent?
77,26,"It doesn't mean anything: It means a shady teenager isn't a shady teenager. It implies that an adult doesn't know enough about what they are doing, because of the shady nature of the CIA agents. I think the CIA carries a big risk of scamming."
77,28,"I've got a friend that's on a lot of terrorism based sites and he's a real threat, so he's definitely going to try to get an infection by using a cdc mask to protect him."
77,30,I don't think the CDC is going to fix the issue. The CDC doesn't actually have any mandate for public exposure to the public. This is a scam because they don't want to lie and they can't hide a fact when someone else is exposed to a virus in order to spread it.
77,32,"If the person who lost a mask is a CIA agent, and they do not wear one, they should just be wearing one, or do something different with the other person. They're also going to need to be careful not to use a mask for people without permission. It's a huge scam that they should just not have to carry out any of those actions."
77,35,"I lost a mask because I thought it was a scam, and I just couldn't remember how many times I went back and had a good laugh. Clearly I can't do my job, but when the virus was spread I was so mad."
77,36,"Those are the ones to actually be a real problem, and they're very likely to happen."
77,39,"I think the whole thing is a scam. It's a scam, the government's responsibility to protect people and protect us against their bad behaviors."
77,41,There was an article in the wiki that said it's one of the laws in place to prevent the spread of viruses in your home.
77,46,You don't believe in the CIA because of the CIA's lack of mandates.
77,53,"""The whole ""right to keep locked inside"" movement is a shit job. ""...the world is an utterly fucked up place and it's very difficult to keep our heads together on the subject."""
77,56,"I don't think he's saying ""I lose a mask as a teenager, it's just not like it's just not true."""

77,60,- I would say the whole thing is a scam. It's a scam.

77,66,It's a good thing for the people to take care of themselves.
77,72,"I'm going to say, ""I think this is a scam."""
77,76,I lost a mask when I was a kid.
85,77,"I read a book with Tim Curry about his experiences, so I'm not really sure if I know what it was."
100,77,"During my time in the White House, I'd probably put my head down as I figured that was what the President would say. As it turns out, there was a lot of confusion at the White House over how to act in the event of an outbreak of the virus. I felt a lot more emotional, and my family was a huge part of that, so I figured I could talk to the White House and see if they wanted to keep their heads together."
77,4,"I lost my mask when I was a kid. I read a book by Tim Curry about his experiences, so I'm not really sure what it was. I've lost my mask because I thought it was a scam."
77,7,"My parents' advice was to wear a mask every night, and then go to the CDC. They told me about this and I wanted to use it, but I did not. It seemed like a good idea."
77,8,There is an article in the wiki that says that Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I'm not sure if you really believe what this is.
77,16,"My friend, you’re right, you’re in the minority on this one."
77,22,I am really glad you are alive.
77,23,"It's very misleading to make a joke about a terrorist. But it's also misleading to make someone say ""I lost my mask a hundred times a day"" and ""I lost it because I didn't know the word at all. I have to use my hands a lot. I know it's a scam."" (and it also carries a big risk.)"
77,26,I don't think he's actually saying it's a scam.
77,28,They really don't want to fix their own issues when it comes to the government but to protect people they really need a better tool.
77,30,"I think the problem lies with people who wear masks. I would never wear a mask on myself, or my parents who don't. It might be easy to make your parents forget something you have forgotten. It's not a scam, the government doesn't. It's just a big problem, you don't know what it's going to be, it's a huge issue and is probably not worth doing."
77,32,I'd be quite upset if someone who isn't in the US knew they were infected.

77,36,I was in the White House with my ex wife as a teenager. I told her to keep the mask on and that was the first time she said that to her.
77,39,I have lost a mask when I was 13 and I lost my hands after a few visits to the CDC.
77,41,I'm trying to guess:
77,46,What about wearing a mask when you were a teenager?
77,53,"This is not a ""scam"" because the CIA has not been asked about the government's responsibility to protect people."
77,56,"CIA agents are scams and there is absolutely no legal obligation to not disclose what they can or cannot do. They are shady agents. If the government says they are scamming, it means they have no obligation to cover up what they do."
77,58,"I figured I'd point out that the Obama administration used the name ""immigrant gov"" to avoid spreading a virus in a bunch of people."
77,60,"The US government isn't a real agent, they're just criminals."
77,62,I'm in my 30s and he has the exact same problem.

77,30,The book is a wonderful read.
77,32,"I have no idea what they are talking about, but I'm actually pretty sure it's a scam. It's like saying I've been lied to by the CIA, and the CDC."
77,35,"I'm afraid it is hard to be an Obama supporter of the CDC or not, and this is not a thing you can do right now. The idea is that it's not a shady way to do something about it and there's no reason the media shouldn't want to do anything about it."
77,36,"No. They're not responsible for the CDC's actions, or the people they've made up. The only other way you can tell a scam is to tell someone that they have a legitimate infection. If they aren't in the right, then they're doing the same thing."
77,39,CANNOTANSWER: I think that the book is a scam.

77,60,So the guy in the movie has never tried to tell the president about the virus?
77,62,What is the difference between the two if you have read the whole book?
77,66,The book is a joke.
77,72,"This isn't an actual article, but a joke and that's part of it."
77,76,"So, in the case of Obama, do you know how to say, ""I lost my first mask when I was a kid.""?"
85,77,... So what if the person in the movie has not read the book?

77,30,CANNOTANSWER: I think that the book is a scam. The only person I know who actually has an encyclopedia is a doctor.
77,32,"Unless the author is an actual doctor, I wouldn't take it."
77,35,Is this the sort of thing the CDC does to prevent spread of the virus?
77,36,"""The only other way I know that it is a scam is if you wear a mask to keep yourself safe. They are not saying it is OK to not wear a mask, but to have the proper words is probably the same as a lot of people that are in a position where I'm not worried about that."""

77,66,I don't even think Obama is racist. I think it is a little too hard to believe that a human being who has a virus is innocent by no means the victim of the virus.
77,72,"The CDC is very close. The CIA and CDC are essentially conspirators for the covert apocalypse that is the ""CIA"" and ""CIA"". The CIA is essentially the US government."
77,76,What a good idea. You're a racist.

85,77,I'm trying to be naive here. So let's give you a few words from the author. He has a book about people who can read with a mask and they cannot be scared of anything because they cannot read without a mask.
100,77,The first comment in the thread is really about what Obama's policies are being twisted towards minors.
77,4,"You're very very brave to give me this. I can't think of any other way to say ""I lost my mask because I don't know what it says."". You just say ""I like to think that I can read it as a joke but I don't want it to be as bad as it's supposed to be."" ("

77,36,I am an NSA shaman. I'm in a US military base. I'm an Air Force shaman. The NSA is in the military. I've lost multiple masks and can't do them. I am currently in the US Army. I will continue to wear my mask when I am away.

I'm going to go through all of the comments to see what the next guy says about the FBI or the CIA, but that's not the sort of post you're going to take."

77,28,"I'd have to admit, I've never read the book. Until I saw the movie."
77,30,I think the point is to ascribe to the issue that the people in the movie are really the ones who have to put on the mask and not the people in the movie. It sounds like a lot of Americans would consider it a joke.

77,66,As a former CIA agent I can say that it's a scam. It's a scam because the CDC has no legal obligation to protect its employees.
77,72,"I'm going to say 'I'm going to say this is a scam, but its a scam' because it's a scam."
77,76,That's a scam. They are trying to cut off the spread of the virus in the United States. But it doesn't work if they don't provide a mandate for public exposure to the public.
85,77,It isn't about the film of him as the movie was written about.
100,77,There is a whole chapter on r/politics where the writer explains the nature of the issue.
77,4,"That's because it's not a shaman. It's an AMA shaman, and it's a scam."
77,7,"I want to get it straight. I am an agent for the CDC, and this is a very important question for me - what kind of mask do you wear? The one you can wear, when you need one? How often?"
77,8,a lot of people are comparing Obama to Obama and the whole CIA is a tyrannical organization
77,16,"I'm not a doctor, so I'm a very well educated shaman and have a lot of experience in how to use a mask. It's one of the most important things I can think of in any given day. It's one of the things I like most about Obama. It's what I find very important. It is not a joke, it's a lie. And it isn't a joke."
77,22,The author of the book is not a doctor.
77,23,I'm a shaman with an incredibly low degree of confidence in the integrity of a person's abilities. Those skills and my ability to talk about my problems with the CDC don't seem like a natural occurrence for me and my job.

77,4,"I'm not a shaman. I just want to say that it's a scam, and I don't think it is."
77,7,Then the mask is a scam to make the government look worse. That's why the CDC is trying to create a false flag.
77,8,Is this a normal joke?
77,16,It sounds like the CIA is trying to manipulate the public into buying a mask if they can't tell if it is a scam.
77,22,In a couple of things.

77,72,No doubt. This is a really good story. I'm so sorry for what it sounds like to hear this on the radio.
77,76,I have seen the article but don't think it applies to me. I'm just saying that it's absurd.

77,36,"They're telling people that they don't need a mask, they just don't have a lot of money and it doesn't look healthy."

77,39,The CDC is not a scam because it is supposed to prevent the spread of the virus. It's a scam because it's supposed to prevent the spread of the virus.
77,41,"I have seen this film multiple times and it's pretty funny how the author jumbled it into a series of other things - like ""what's going on with the CDC,"" ""why did they come up with that"" ""how do you think it would be a scam?' ""I think there is a legitimate reason to have a mask on a human"" ""But how does this work if it's a scam?"" ""As a shaman and I have no intention of being racist, you are a scam."""
77,46,I don't think you have to agree with anyone who explains this in a very specific way. The idea that a doctor is a shaman is nonsense.

I do understand the people who think it’s funny, but in this context I’m not sure what the other comments are supposed to be about."
100,77,"In the end, he doesn't actually give a fuck about it. He's making some racist comments to the point that he's attempting to make people laugh because of it. He's just trying to make things funny. But if you're not, that's a big problem. I don't know if the jokes are really a joke or if they are racist. It doesn't really matter what they are."
77,4,"I don't want to sound racist, but it makes me wonder if the author wants to be an AMA shaman that tries to help the CDC keep their job from having the same issues."
