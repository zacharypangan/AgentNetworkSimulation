46,1,A mask is necessary to have the right to be the last resort and to be able to leave safely without any problem.
46,7,If you want to talk about it just like you say it isn't ok - you can go into the vaccinated department and see if anyone has the mandates on what is safe.
46,12,"Despite the fact that we're talking about the same thing twice, I'm not sure how much they know about the mask... unless the actual issue has some sort of specific definition of the word ""mask"". I've also read it a bit, but i don't think that's an appropriate word. If the title says ""mask"" then it's a bit misleading."
46,36,"We have masks on all games, too, including twitchcon. It's called ""drug war"" but you can't really just say 'No'without sighing."
52,46,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
54,46,I think this is a good way to think about this:
59,46,"He's just a dude. Not a professional or any kind of guy he can stand. He has the same right to make people who don't wear masks, to feel safe."
60,46,We know the best way to prevent infections is to get vaccines and have your mask in the fridge.
62,46,"I've done a lot of dumb things and my body is completely disgusting. You don't need a mask to take off. You do need a mask to get out. There are lots of other people in a similar situation, like you, who have a great sense of humor."
64,46,"If a mask is the best thing in the world, then it's only worth it to have them on. If it's the best thing in the world, then it's not worth it."
74,46,"I'm not saying if someone wants to talk about the mask, I think it is an ineffective ad, as it's not a good idea to have one on your team because the players can't take it, but as a coach, you're responsible for having a hard time breathing. I think the people you don't want to talk about that need to have an argument about it."
76,46,"We eat in our own way. It is in our power, to not eat in the same way it is in ours."
77,46,I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam. I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam. I lose a mask at least four times a day.

82,46,...but at the same time i m a fan of the guy with the boosters
46,1,>A mask is necessary to have the right to have the right to be the last resort and to be able to leave safely without any problem.
46,7,I’m going to get your meds NOW.
46,12,So what you want us to do to protect the world is to keep someone alive if they can't wear a mask?... if you want to lose your life unless you have the capability to wear one then your rights to not be a part of the world are not being violated by a mask.
46,36,"I mean, you should try a different mask. A better one is the one with the mask, that i like but it looks silly when you wear one."
52,46,I'm not sure how much of an issue the article is going to get.
54,46,"I have a friend who is a hockey fan. She wears a mask on the road in the summer and he has to wear it. He wears a mask at times in the summer and in the winter, so she doesn't wear a mask. Its not a bad thing and no matter what you do, it doesn't affect her health."
59,46,A lot of the commenters here are referring to the fact that the sport doesn't mandate the helmets when a player wears a mask. They're referring to the fact that players wear a mask in the game. It's not a 'tough' decision but it is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
60,46,You are not a dick.
62,46,"Vaccination is not a way of stopping the spread of a virus. I feel like this is a good thing, and you seem to have done a lot of dumb things. Trump said it's ok not to wear mask, and Ingraham said it's restricting our rights to keep us locked inside! You know our right to die and infect (kill) others. Why isn't Ms. Ingraham out there with them?"
64,46,It's a good thing if I don't wear a mask. It's a bit dangerous.
74,46,I can't get past the fact that wearing a mask is not a bad idea. In this case it is because you're wearing the wrong type of mask and have a rash.
76,46,"That's what a medical term is for. There are many, many ways to prevent the spread of a virus. They are just part of the plan."
77,46,I lost my mask because I didn't know the word at all. I have to use my hands a lot. I know it's a scam.

82,46,"It isn't as much a problem as it is a dick move. What you're referencing is full of false information about the government trying to stop the spread of a virus.

46,1,"The op is missing an important point, I know, because I do not understand it. I want you to know, OP, that the ad has a lot to do with the president's decision to make."
46,7,"Well, it's not your problem - it's just your health."
46,12,"The mask is a legal and ethical requirement, not an economics one. This is something we can be forced to do ourselves, i.e. to not be in a position of authority. A very large part of our legal system is built around it."
46,36,"You are missing the point. A lot of people have said this before, it's a common excuse of all the dicks."
52,46,It is just a scam.
54,46,"You gotta wear a mask and make sure it's not a health risk for someone else, because if it's an adult and it's not healthy, I think they'd be fine with that"
59,46,"You're right to talk about the dangers of using masks, but they're only used for the purpose of preventing the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
60,46,'Alright. You're not going to see me.'
62,46,So here's my take: “Mallets are a way for people to walk to the grocery store without being struck or beaten”
64,46,"It's so sad that there are so many masks in the military, I work as a medical director for a medical organization in the United States and they are an official company."
74,46,"I’m just going to say that my parents are not stupid, they’re stupid. They do not know how to get people to wear masks. Is this an utter misconception in your head? If they are, you should probably go to the authorities and request that the masks be changed or removed and replace the masks."
76,46,"> It is in our power, to not eat in the same way it is in ours."
77,46,"It's a scam to send your victims, not your mask, to the CIA, and the government, without any specific facts."
78,46,"Vaccines are good, but they are not good, and are not recommended for people that are already getting vaccinated."
79,46,"No, it's not. I'm pretty sure that any man is a fool. Isn't it safe to not wear a mask? Because it's the only way to protect you from infections."
82,46,"[(https://www.wiznet.org/posts/afaik/twitch-con_as_the-troll_i_am_a_troll/s) he's being ""fucking insane"" for wearing a mask. You can't do that, and your mask doesn't work."
46,1,"As a Republican, I'm disappointed. You have such an amazing ability to make a shit about your own personal privacy. It's so blatant that you have to be aware of your own rights."
46,7,"I do not like to wear my mask, and I don't wear my mask either. The whole problem is that it makes me uncomfortable and unable to breathe. I think it's more that I don't like faking it and I don't know what it is or what it can do."

46,36,"Is this not your problem? I mean if you know that this is not a troll, you know that that's the same as saying he's being ""fucking insane"" for wearing a mask. You know, i know it's a scam."
52,46,"It's a scam, because it's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
54,46,"IANAL, but there is a difference between a fucking 'troll' and a narcissist who isn't actually actually that racist."
59,46,My father was an apologist for the vaccine program that was implemented in 2001.
60,46,You’re talking about a bunch of people who have been having difficulty breathing because of the CDC’s 'viruses' and other stuff.
62,46,"I am not saying they cant stop us from doing dumb things, but they can, in a sense, do good. That's not how the NSA works and it is not the government that is in the loop about the safety of our children, but they are nefarious and insecure. And they are using it for whatever reason, and they are just making a joke. This is the government not our government and they are nefarious as a result of this."
64,46,"""Wearing a mask,any mask and you will see the leakage. It's frightening how dumb they think all of is are. I've a lot of personal experiences with this subject. It was my first time doing it for a while but it didn't really go well. I did find out a while back that it was very tame, and it took a while for my ad sunk.

76,46,"I don't know about what the article is referencing, but the part where they're trying to get Maroon into the government's system is one of the first steps."
77,46,I lost my mask because I had no idea what I was doing and I was in a serious state of shock. I think this is all about the truth and being honest with others. This is what it says.
78,46,You are going to do it in order.
79,46,>Wording a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.It's funny. Why would anyone want to be an assistant at the NSA. They are making it all about masks. The government doesn't have to wear them because it's the only way to do that.
82,46,I had an interview with a CDC lawyer and he had the impression the state of the CDC is putting into place regulations that prevent people from getting vaccines. His wife had to sign and sign up and she got the vaccine.
46,1,"So, when did the ad begin?"
46,7,"'I can't do that', 'I’m going to get your meds NOW.', 'Well, it’s not your problem - it’s just your health."", 'Well, it’s more that I don’t like faking it and I don’t know what it can do.

46,12,"This is something we can be forced to do ourselves, i.e. to not be in a position of authority. A very large part of our legal system is built around it."
46,36,I'm so sorry to hear that.
52,46,"You can get a mask to keep a head clean from your skin, but if it's too late, it could be used as an indicator of illness for the player, which is a bad thing to do, because they will have a virus in their heads, and have to be injected with the wrong things. It could be used to prevent a child from dying from a virus."
54,46,"What's more, this is just the first time that I've heard it. I feel like someone is doing the same thing. I just feel like there are people on the street that say ""wow, people don't like your jokes"" or something. I get that people just don't care if you're a criminal. I feel like if I were a criminal I wouldn't even care. I'm not even a criminal because my life is so crazy and horrible, and I've got it for about an hour."
59,46,"""I have to put a mask on and ask if it's an appropriate thing to do. It's not a big deal, and it is over the top. Is there a difference between a troll and a narcissist who isn't even that racist. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table."
60,46,There are more in the world than you can possibly imagine.
62,46,I had a friend who worked for the CIA when he got AIDS and I remember having that happen to him. He was doing this when he had the problem. He was working on a house that had a house on the right side of the road and he walked through a restaraunt. He said he found it too dangerous to do because he was so busy with his own stuff.
64,46,"The ""Failure is the fear. The fear is the fear of fear of fear. And the fear of fear."""
74,46,"Is this an utter misconception in your head? If they are, you should probably go to the authorities and request that the masks be changed or replaced and replace the masks."
76,46,"Yes, I can see why he's doing this. That's the defining characteristic of a criminal and he has the right to be an asshole. But there are people who would refuse to go back to the government for help with a crime and are sick. I know we've heard about this and it's a good thing we don't have any other ways to prevent the spread of a disease."
77,46,"I have a friend who lost his mother's mask to the CIA. He lost her as a baby and her mom was bitten, and then went to the CIA."
78,46,I just wanna know if this makes sense to you.
79,46,"CANNOTANSWER : ""I know you're an idiot and can't stand that kind of guy. You have a problem with sd vaccination laws and that they are not mandated. It's really cool. It's one of the smartest things in the world to want people to live their lives, not die to a virus. It's not like there's something to talk about. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks."
82,46,It's very confusing and ridiculous that people don't like the government.
46,1,"I have been told that the NSA's goal is to make a ""fucking idiotic joke"" on their website."

46,36,"Vaccination laws aren't mandatory for any sort of person, so the way they're being enforced in a society seems pretty weird."
52,46,"We use them all the time in the military. We use them all the time in the military, a lot of our team is in the military, and the majority of our players do not have masks and gloves."
54,46,"Yeah, the whole story is about people being ""cowards"". I don't know whether or not you have to be a jerk, but there are a lot of people that have not gotten vaccinated."
59,46,I'd say 'My mother is the best syphilis patient I've ever had'
60,46,There is nothing in the US government that will prevent the spread of a virus.
62,46,"I was there, doing some thing."
64,46,This makes me feel a lot better about the country I live in than the country I work in.
74,46,"This isn't an apology, the video is."
76,46,"I am going to go out on a limb and say this. The first paragraph is a bad choice for me. I think this person should be in the medical community. A lot of people do not want to talk about the virus. He needs a mask. I think it's the fact that he contacted the government. He could've contacted them as a friend, but wouldn't have called them on it. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus."
77,46,"I had a friend who lost his mother's mask because the CIA said they had a falsehood that the child was infected by a virus. The mother went and sued them in federal court for that. The mask blew up. The CIA had a falsehood, and it was the CIA who caught him."
78,46,"I woke up in front of the TV after the CDC's ban on vaccinating people and a hat, so I was confused if this is something my doctor said."
79,46,I agree with you here. There are some major flaws in Obama's health care policy in the states that they're not required' to follow it.
82,46,"It's a big deal because there's so much noise coming from his face. The mask is the whole point of the health care law, as opposed to what it's supposed to be."
46,1,> I'm confused if this is something my doctor said.
46,7,I can't believe the CDC has been claiming this is true.
46,12,"I had a friend who lost his mother's mask to the CIA. He lost her as a baby and her mom was bitten, and then went to the CIA."
46,36,"The CDC's ban on vaccinating people and a hat. This isn't a major problem here, it's just that they're doing so to try and cut a few people out of the fight. Especially the people who don't have the necessary medical equipment."
52,46,"I'm very sorry, but this is a prank."
54,46,A lot of people are saying that they need to wear a mask for the sake of preventing the spread of viruses.
59,46,"Vaccination is not a ""tough"" decision, it's the ""tough"" decision."
60,46,There is a CIA slam on the side of a scam that the government doesn't want to work under.
62,46,"What? You just told me that if you don't like it, you can go to jail. And if not, you can talk to the NSA."
64,46,"In my state, I believe that a very small percentage of people have an emergency doctor's appointment because they cannot be properly sterilized in their workplaces. I think the average person will be extremely anxious, and even more anxious when they see a doctor. You may be able to avoid this for the rest of your life, but a large majority of people think they're doing something wrong. There's no way you could take the time to go to the hospital and ask about the disease but you do have some very bad healthily."

82,46,i don't like the government. i don't see how the government is putting into place regulations that prevent people from getting vaccines.
46,1,"As an avid reader of the American savages of obamacare, I can assure you there is nothing in this article that would have anything to do with the health care policy of the people claiming they are the cause of the disease. If you believe what they have said, you need to make a public statement about it. They are trying to make a sham to keep their name down."
46,7,"I've been going through this and this in the past. It's pretty clear that this has been something that's wrong with a person's health, and that he is simply not the person who's being pranked. You may not even like it, but it's a real problem, and I believe this isn't something that is going to be fixed by the government. It just isn't worth it to me."
46,12,The CDC has made a lot of mistakes.
46,36,I think you are overreacting. The CIA is a serious shithole.
52,46,It seems like the only way he's being offended by a joke is to say that his comments are a bit off-putting. It's an extremely stupid joke. And this isn't a joke.
54,46,They are narcissists. They are people who want to eat what is going on around them.
59,46,"This is why people can't have sex, and i have to wear masks, because i've never done sex. Vaccines aren't the best thing to do. They're designed to protect people from the spread of the virus."
60,46,What is your experience with masks?
62,46,"The NSA is making a joke about putting people in places where there is no law to protect them. They don't want to protect themselves and make everyone else feel bad about it. The NSA isn't suing him because they aren't willing to go back to his job. This is how they get to prevent it, but the government isn't willing to do it."
64,46,I'm a medical director. I've had to leave a couple of places to live unless I was in the Army. That is probably why I chose a mask - if the medicine wasn't in my hands I'd probably be in the Army.
74,46,That's not a conspiracy theory. The government can make you want to stop it. It is an official thing. The CDC isn't really saying you need to wear a mask and that you're gonna be fine.
76,46,I don't think a doctor would be able to tell Maroon who he was contacted to and that he's not getting it at the moment.
77,46,You don't believe in the CIA because of the CIA's lack of mandates.
78,46,I have been to the CDC a few times and it sounded like a good idea to ask someone if they have any questions. I don't know what that means.
79,46,It's not a joke. It's a joke that a man will not want to do.
82,46,"Vaccination is a terrible disease. If the team is vaccinated, a player can not be infected. If they are not vaccinated, you will have to wear a mask. It's a bad thing. The only way to stop it is to put on a mask so you can be vaccinated. The only thing that has changed is the political agenda."
46,1,I'd have the same problem with anyone who is in a position to do it with the NSA. It isn't about vaccinating the people. They are just being silly.
46,7,You are not wrong. You're just wrong.
46,12,"You can't put yourself in a position where you aren't safe. Then again, you're a criminal and will be prosecuted for this. You're a scumbag."

52,46,"> I've tried wearing a mask before, but it doesn't work. I'm pretty sure it does work with your nose."
54,46,There are so many nonsenses going on that they are not even funny. It is amazing how people respond to things like these.
59,46,"I don't care for sex in general. I know that it's in the public interest to be protected, but I am also more concerned with making someone's body aware that it is possible to be infected."
60,46,It is the joke that they are trying to make fun of him.

76,46,There's only one person on this subreddit who doesn't know the law.
77,46,What about wearing a mask when you were a teenager?
78,46,It's a shame the media has been rushing to make this ridiculous.
79,46,"There is one very important issue that the government doesn't need to worry about, and isn't going to address that very much. It's not like the NSA is going to ask people to have a conversation over. It's that they don't have the authority to regulate it."
82,46,I'm a major Vaccine Vaccine enthusiast. This is a huge topic of conversation for the community.
46,1,"It's a great idea to help those who get sick or need to get vaccinated by wearing a mask, as the CDC isn't getting around to doing this. It's just a little too much for this craze."
46,7,I like to go to the CDC and see if anyone has the mandates on what is safe. It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
46,12,It's a shame that the CIA didn't have the right to enforce it.
46,36,"There are a lot of things wrong with the CDC. Vaccination is a terrible disease. If the team is vaccinated, a player can not be infected. If they are not vaccinated, you will have to wear a mask. It's a bad thing. The only thing that has changed is the political agenda."

54,46,"So, do you even know what the CDC is doing?"
59,46,"I don't understand why you think this is a joke and not a fact. I thought it was a joke and didn't really care at all. It was really dumb and a prank and a satire. And no trolls have a right to say they don't care, and if he or she said that he was a troll then he was probably wrong."

64,46,"As someone who is a medical director, I feel incredibly ashamed."
74,46,The fact that it's illegal is a red flag. And what does the CDC say about it? Yeah you're a dick.
76,46,"It's interesting that this is on reddit. It's like a ""Scumbag"" sub."

79,46,What the hell is funny about being a politician?
82,46,"I was going to say this but the CDC is putting out some kind of mandate saying that everyone should be vaccinated. I'd say that this isn't something that's changed in the past, but that some things have changed."
46,1,"What's funny is that the CDC is doing this because they believe that ""vaccinating"" people isn't a legitimate choice."
46,7,Then why the fuck would you be a politician?
46,12,The CDC has to enforce it on a personal level and you're not a troll because it's illegal.
46,36,The thing that is a problem for me is how stupid the players look with their masks and the stupidity and denial they display. I have never even considered going there. It is not like they would try and force themselves on anyone who is not in a doctor's office. Vaccination is terrible and I will never be vaccinated again. I just don't see any problem with it.
52,46,"It's not like a joke, it's just a joke."
54,46,Vaccinating against the virus is the best way to prevent the spread of the virus.

64,46,>A lot of people who work for the government. Is this a joke?
74,46,This seems to be a little misleading and misleading.
76,46,There is a little bit of a difference in the way that vaccines are used in the U.S.. (though not that this is a common statement); but what is the difference in how this is being used?
77,46,OP is an AMA shaman. The book is about the dangers of wearing masks to protect people from HIV.
78,46,"I am going to put my mask on. I want to put on my mask. I can't, I don't care, but this is a rant."
79,46,Vaccines are the only way to prevent the spread of a virus. The CDC and the CDC don't have the same funding. It's the only authority figure to protect people who need to be vaccinated. It doesn't work either.
82,46,I like the idea of getting vaccinated with a mask. I just want to wear it.
46,1,"Yes, and the question is ""Which is the matter?'"""
46,7,I think OP is being pretty fucked up.
46,12,I just want to say this to someone who isn't a lawyer.

60,46,"The problem here is the CDC isn't doing anything about the vaccine, the government. They are just trying to make a joke."
62,46,Vaccination is the best way to stop the spread of the virus.
64,46,They're all people with the same opinions.
74,46,"I've had the same situation, with no problem. I think I would go to the authorities and ask them to change the mask."
76,46,And this is the latest example of the government's incompetence. And there are plenty of people who don’t even understand the importance of the issue at hand. A concussion is a virus. A concussion is a virus. A concussion is a virus.
77,46,"""The Devil Wears a Mask"" is an article written by a shaman who was raised in a shaman household."
78,46,What do you think of the joke?
79,46,It's a joke. The government isn't required to regulate afaik as the CDC is. It's just that they don't have the authority to ban afaik at all.
82,46,"No, they aren't a joke."
46,1,There are a lot of fags here that would like to know why the CDC is going to be a fag. I think there are people in here that can get away with just going off a bit. I don't think a person in a room wearing a mask would even want to know what that was.
46,7,"""You are not wrong. You're just wrong. This is a really stupid prank. This is why the government is incompetent and a good one."""
46,12,I think the CDC should be banned from doing any of these things.
46,36,That is a real hat. I'm an AMA shaman and I was in the military and never had a problem wearing a mask.
52,46,"If there's a joke in the military, it's a joke."
54,46,"No, the jokes are about the government."
59,46,"You are correct that they do have the right to make everyone feel safe. If it were the CIA, he would be in trouble."
60,46,A lot of the jokes are very silly. The first part is about the people who were sick. I believe it was a joke but the second half is about the CDC trying to get rid of vaccines and not the public health department trying to stop a virus. That's like saying there's a lot of things you can be ashamed of.
62,46,This is not a joke. Vaccination is the best way to stop the spread of the virus.

He's trying to prove the president isn't a troll because he's like a joke and doesn't work on a problem like the president is trying to hide. Because you wear a mask and you feel like you are part of the gang, and the government doesn't want to deal with the consequences of doing it if you’re infected."

59,46,Vaccines are designed to prevent the spread of a virus. They are only necessary to prevent the spread of a virus. The only way to stop the spread of the virus is to treat the CDC. The only way to prevent the spread of a virus.
