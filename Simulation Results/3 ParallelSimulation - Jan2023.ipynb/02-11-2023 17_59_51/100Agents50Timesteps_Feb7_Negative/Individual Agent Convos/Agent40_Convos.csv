It’s also not so effective for your health, but it’s actually a bit misleading because it’s the only way you can keep a team safe."
89,40,And that's just a symptom of the general horde of people who think they're right to wear a mask.
91,40,">I've never had a job with a government official, but I've been in the army for 3 years, and have been vaccinated multiple times. I can't imagine how much of a pain it would be to have to go back to work to get vaccinated. I have been in the NFL for almost three years. I don't think any of this will happen again. So, the putting on of a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of a virus."

70,40,"I think it is a joke, but I think a lot of people are being very negative here. It doesn't sound like there is anything wrong with a mask, ie that you're fucking stupid."
74,40,Apparently it's a conspiracy theory based on an article.

40,38,The truth about the government doesn't seem to hold any weight in the context of the actual article.
43,40,I think the jokes are coming from the CDC. But he isn't being a sham. He's trying to get the CDC to help stop spread of the virus.
48,40,"The article says that the CDC has no responsibility to act on the CDC's use of ""minority and minorities"" to stop people from having infections in the general population. So the CDC is supposed to be there and allow them to be in the health care industry to prevent infections as well. That's a very serious problem."

74,40,"Well, here's the part of the article that's very interesting. I think you're a bit off topic."
86,40,The president is a troll.

89,40,Almost like you're a narcissist and don't want a mask.

59,40,It doesn't mean you didn't have a shit to say.

93,40,Ingraham and the US have always been a dangerous place to work and for those of us who need to be protected. I think the government has a problem with a lot of gov't rules.
95,40,"So you're saying he's being a prankster, and not a joke about the sprite?"
100,40,I think it's not a bad idea if the president is trying to keep children from getting the viruses in public.
40,14,Vaccination is a very useful precaution. There's a lot more to it than you 'know'. You have to wear a mask or you'll die of a cold.
40,15,"...as an nfl fan, I just thought it was a joke."
40,30,That is a really great question. Is the president a government worker or something? Is he a politician? I would imagine he is in a position to talk about the problem.
40,31,"The problem is that the government is trying to protect people by not doing what it thinks is a great idea, and has a tendency to play tricks to make it seem like they're actually working."
40,38,It's not about the government. It's about the federal government. The government is trying to make a joke about it. You don't know what it's about. It's about trying to avoid people from getting a virus.
43,40,The president is a dick.
48,40,">If the CIA and NSA were preventing sex, what would they do?"
59,40,So I'm a guy in the NFL and have been in the NFL.
61,40,"As an American who's gotten vaccinated for HIV/VHC, I don't think sex is a problem, that's why you have to wear a mask. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of the virus. Please wear masks."
62,40,"I was trying to say something along the lines of the CIA is a bad idea but they're not suing for it. And I think they are, which is very, very true of most people, trying to help with the problem."
68,40,Vaccination is not racist if you wear it for work. It's racist because it is necessary to protect against the spread of the virus. The ACA isn't racist because it's not racist because of the law.
70,40,So you're going to take the right path here.
74,40,"I think a mask is a good idea. If you don't like it, just get the temporary restraining order from a lawyer. Then wear it."
86,40,Is the government acting as a puppet? What's he doing?
87,40,I can't see why anyone would say something like that. I would say it's pretty clear that the government is trying to protect the public from the public at large.
89,40,"I have a friend who didn't have any sarcasm. I'm going to ask her if she likes a mask. Because she is not. She doesn't like a mask. Rather, I like that she thinks that she is stupid and she's not a narcissist."
91,40,I think it's important to remember the following:
93,40,A man who tries to control his own destiny in public is a terrorist. He wants to stop it. Is it possible to protect the government from terrorists?
95,40,"I'm not sure what you mean by 'not a prankster', is that this is a joke about a joke, a joke about the sprite, a joke about the sprite and some of the other things you would consider a prank."
100,40,> A man with a mask who wears masks in public places who goes to the White House when he's trying to talk about the virus and does his part to prevent it from happening.
40,14,It sounds like a very simple question.
40,15,It's hard to explain something in this thread. I'm on mobile so I can't find anything online.
40,30,"As a politician, you are going to need a good lawyer. A lawyer will be fine."
40,31,">If the CIA and NSA were preventing sex, what would they do?"
40,38,Is the president a prankster?
43,40,My friend's son flies from the U.S. to the US. That is a definite shame. And I do not think he has any idea what the president does to protect the nation. He would be a dick to try and avenge a guy he had a relationship with for years. I'm sorry he's a dick.
48,40,The article actually states that the CDC doesn't have a role in helping the spread of the virus.
59,40,"In this post, you are being implying that the CDC is an anti-vaccine force, and in fact a very large conspiracy theory. This is not an article that was cited by the NSA, and is not a joke or even a conspiracy theory."
61,40,"I feel like I'm the person that just told the truth, because it sounds like he did."
62,40,The problem is that you're gonna be a racist if the president went against the law to stop a virus in public. You're just saying the government is trying to make people feel stupid.
68,40,'Baby's going to be a different question than 'Where's the ACA?'
70,40,A lot of Americans think that a mask is useful and is necessary to prevent spread of the virus. People believe that you're an idiot for wearing a mask while you're sick.
74,40,hes really an ass
86,40,... but he's the one who is the one who is bringing the problem up.
87,40,"You’ve been vaccinated for a long time, huh?"
89,40,"[It's not a joke. It's a joke. The CDC is suing the people who don't wear a mask. It's the easiest way for a virus to spread, and it's the only way to prevent the spread of the virus."
91,40,"I'm sorry. I can't even get my head around the issue, but there is this ambiguous quote about the idea of getting the vaccine while in the military, about the need to stop the spread of a virus and get the mask on. I hope that makes the article more interesting."
93,40,"Aside from this, I am concerned that the government has the right to prevent sex from going back to our country if necessary and the CIA has the authority to change these rules."
95,40,You are a joke. OP is not making a joke. You are just making a joke.
100,40,This is very clear on the subject of a lot of people talking about the threat of the virus.
40,14,If the CDC can't prevent a virus from escaping it's a problem. You're just saying that.
40,15,"I feel like you are right in your own mind that the CDC is not an anti-vaccination force. In fact they are suing people who do not wear a mask to stop a virus from spread. That is a prank, you're a fucking dick."
40,30,"There are a lot of people on here who don't know about the ACA, and that's one of them."
40,31,I like your username. You are not a joke.
40,38,"The CDC and the CIA are helping the spread of the virus. In fact, despite the fact that a mask is the best thing in the world to stop it, that doesn't make the situation any less horrifying."
43,40,> Why are you saying that Vaccination isn't a joke. He's referencing the fact that CDC is in the process of making a ban on the helmet. Vaccination isn't a joke. He's referencing the fact that CDC is in the process of making a ban on the helmet. Vaccination isn't a joke.
48,40,"""If the CIA and NSA were preventing sex, what would they do?'"
59,40,"If you don't know, there's nothing illegal about it."
61,40,It's also a joke. It's a cliche.
62,40,"""It's a weird thing, it's just a little weird. I like to wear a mask, even if I'm a kid""."
68,40,"If you think the ACA is racist, the CDC is a racist entity."
70,40,It's an incredibly interesting idea. The president said it's the President of the United States and didn't get much publicity for it. I've seen people get away with it.
74,40,"I think people should understand that they're a little bit of a hoarder. I don't think it's any different than wearing a mask to help protect yourself. You think the CDC does something wrong, then you think the government is stupid, that's why you're so concerned about the virus."
86,40,I've had the same reaction as you. But I was told I had a very different idea of how I should look at it.
87,40,That's the first thing I thought when reading the title of the post : The Australian government is trying to protect the public from people who are going to go out with friends and they want to talk about how good it is. They do not get to spend hours and hours on drugs. Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
89,40," 'If you don't wear a mask, then you're a troll. I'm really the guy stating the obvious, not the fact that the CDC is suing the people who don't wear a mask. It's the easiest way for a virus to spread, and it's the only way to prevent the spread of the virus.''"
91,40,> He probably hasn't had a clear vision for the first two months of his career.
93,40,What do they think of the NSA and the CIA?
95,40,"So, you said you were a prankster?"
100,40,"I am not racist. The only reason the U.S. president of the United States, Obama is still on the White House is because of his actions."
40,14,> Why are you saying that Vaccination isn't a joke. He's referencing the fact that CDC and the CIA are helping the spread of a virus.
40,15,> Why are you saying that Vaccination isn't a joke.
40,30,I think what I heard is that the anti-vaccine act is a joke and not a big deal.
40,31,"Well, the first time I read your title was when I was a teenager. So I think I can vouch for your idiocy."
40,38,Is the president a prankster?'''
43,40,The article says he had a lot of rules about wearing the masks - and what they do with them is the most accurate explanation for why the rules are in place - a joke.
48,40,I don't think the government is concerned about people getting vaccinated and just taking it off. They're being exploited.
59,40,It's pretty clear that the article was in the US.
61,40,"I don't like the humor at all, but a lot of people think that it's funny. I feel like a joke is funny, but I'm not offended at it."
62,40,"I believe the word ""scam"" comes from the term ""fake mask"" – the word that the doctor uses to describe a fake mask. It's a popular joke on tv."

70,40,The president was clearly trying to sabotage the Obama administration with this joke. It wasn't even the joke itself.
74,40,"It's a real issue. This is the case for the rest of us, if you aren't getting vaccinated, I highly recommend a mask, if you aren't vaccinated you should do something to help you."
86,40,"I think people who see these articles do. If people just stop looking at the article, they will probably find a different way to look at the whole thing."
87,40,"There are two examples of this. One is a person who lost a mask at their job interview, and the other is an intern who volunteered to make an official statement about their health. One has a facial expression on it, and one has a face mask on it."
89,40,It's the only way to prevent the spread of a virus.
91,40,They don't want to do a lot of things about the people. They want the government to put out a vaccine and make it all work and protect the players.
93,40,The NSA has a government-wide censorship and access to sex in foreign countries. You have no idea how that works. I think you're missing something and we don't know if any of this actually exists.
95,40,"OP was just making fun of someone who is allergic to the virus. It wasn't a joke, but he was making fun of someone who is allergic to a virus. It isn't a joke. It's not funny. It's just a joke."

91,40,It's a joke. The government doesn't need to be involved in vaccines because the military isn't equipped to combat them.

95,40,"""I am allergic to the sprite."
100,40,OP has a pretty hard time understanding this.
40,14,What's funny is the article says people aren't being jerked about it.
40,15,So the CDC is trying to make healthcare available to people in the US. They're a troll company. They have no obligation to enforce health care laws. They have no moral obligation to enforce them. Vaccination is a joke.
40,30,They are attempting to stop the spread of the virus and the government's reaction is not based on that.
40,31,Is this a joke?

I've just become very receptive to that type of joke. I don't feel that I've got enough courage to scream it like that all day every day, and if you don't you'll get sick of it. If you're a joke, and you"
59,40,"In general, I don't agree with that claim, and I don't believe that the CDC has a right to make people look dumb."
61,40,"The story was told in the same way that the joke is told, in the same way the joke about the guy who had a narwhal mask as the story was about people who were being snooped on."
62,40,I don't think the joke is true.
68,40,"I like to call the joke ""Twitchycon"" because I don't have to wear a mask and have to worry about getting infected."
70,40,"It’s not a joke. It’s a joke, in a very real way, it’s a joke. The idea is not really a joke. The joke is not a joke."
74,40,"This is a joke. If you like it, you're gonna like this."
86,40,"It looks like the government is trying to help stop the spread of HIV/AIDS. They are trying to get the CDC to let people out because it's a serious concern about the human body. This is a lot like that in China, where the government is trying to get rid of the virus and give you a new face to cover it up."
87,40,"Vaccination is a medical term for a Virus, not a vaccine. It’s a health word for a virus. The government is trying to protect the public from a virus.

93,40,They're the government. It's not about the government. It's about the government.
95,40,"I was thinking that pranksters have a lot of different definitions. This is a very old a joke. A prank is when you see a man make fun of you for being allergic to the sprite, they tell you it is based on it. It's called a prank."
100,40,What's the point of saying it?
40,14,"The government is trying to make the government look like a prankster. It's called a prank, the reason is to imply the public is being spied on."

62,40,>I'm a narcissist. I'm not a lawyer. It sounds like it's really important. They do not want to stop the spread of the disease. But they want to stop it.
68,40,Is this the kind of stuff they don't like about how they do things or don't care about people getting infected or not?
70,40,"In the first few sentences, it's like ""I lost my mask when I was sick, and it's just because I was sick."""

86,40,"There are a lot of things that have gone on in the administration lately that have had a positive effect on them and I'd argue that the problem is in their personal opinion, that's a big issue here and I'd just want to put this in the background as a potential excuse for someone who's not going to be able to evade those consequences. Apparently they are trying to try to do something with the CDC and getting people out, so it's kind of sad."
87,40,"It sounds like the only way to stop the virus is to get a mask, so why not just get a mask with you? It's going to take a lot of work, but if you think it's a good idea to put a mask on, then if you want to stay in the clinic (unless you need to be on the outside) then you need to get vaccinated. This could work in the home environment, and not just a mask."

100,40,"There are very few examples of a joke in a presidential speech, and the one that comes closest to the word joke is the one in the Obama campaign."
40,14,That's a pretty good point. Vaccination has been a joke in the past. They know what they're doing to protect the country. They just don't want to be a prankster.
40,15,The ACA is the worst thing on the planet.
40,30,"They are trying to stop it, but this one is more funny. They are also trying to convince people that the president is a prankster and they haven't proven it's anything but a joke."
40,31,"This is a joke, and a dick joke. You are not allowed to have any say in what is the truth."
40,38,People are being naive. They're being naive. I think a lot of people in the NFL are being naive. They're trying to make the public understand what the president does to protect the nation. He is a prankster.

62,40,Isn't there a government policy to stop the spread of the virus?
68,40,Is there something that a lot of people don't think they're saying?
70,40,"I believe that because of a lack of public awareness, people may not think it's a joke. And the president probably has a lot of problems with people not being prepared to make jokes about this."

86,40,"That's the only way we're going to get out of this, right?"
87,40,"I guess it isn't very effective for the vaccinating of a virus. However, if you get vaccinated properly for this, you have to get one for yourself."
89,40,"Vaccination is not something you just neeeeeed, it's an essential part of a health care system. So, yeah, you can go to twitchcon, but you have to wear a mask because of that. Vaccination is something the FDA and the media should be doing to combat the spread of a virus."
91,40,I think the joke is about the government and the idea that the government is putting out a vaccine that protects people.
93,40,"> You can't change the facts of the story if you think that there are many. a lot of things are over the top. Obama, as a president, has been taking steps to prevent a number of illegal actions."

48,40,"The president's not the CDC, he's the president himself. The president is the president, and he is the President. It's not a joke."
59,40,I can tell you that the people who are getting sick are really not smart and not smart enough to know how to use their mask.
61,40,"The word ""I "" comes from the cliches i've come to find in a lot of fucking jokes about hsb/hsvr, cliches of adolescence, cliches of the people that have to go to a party to stop the spread of hsb/hsb/hsb/sibb/hsb/sibb/hsb/sibb/hsb/hsb/hsb/a"

68,40,I am going to say this about twitchcon and masks because I don't have to wear a mask and have to worry about getting infected. I would be very uncomfortable with not wearing a mask. But I do have a mask I use for my work.
70,40,Vaccination is a joke that is made by the government.
74,40,I am an official HIV virologist and i think the CDC is trying to stop the spread of the virus.
86,40,"I agree with you there, but the restraining order is misleading and misleading. The fact that Obama's restraining order is misleading is the source of his misleading comments. He's trying to make himself look bad, but it's not a restraining order."
87,40,"It's the Canadian thing, vaccinating is a medical term for a virus, not a vaccine."
89,40,"That is a pretty sarcastic way of saying that this is a joke, but I don't think it's the actual joke. The CDC is suing people who don't wear a mask for a joke."
91,40,"Vaccination is the only thing that is really shady, or any more controversial, in this country."
93,40,The CIA has a censorship and access to sex in foreign countries. What do they think of the NSA and the CIA?
95,40,"So, I think it's a joke, but it's still a prank."
100,40,"This is a joke that is very clear about the topic - the President's stance on it. That's what he's saying, and he's in fact saying it because of that."
40,14,People get mad if their masks aren't required by law.
40,15,">""...I am an official HIV virologist and i think the CDC is trying to make healthcare available to people in the US."

40,38,I don't think you'll even be able to figure it out.
43,40,The fact that he is trying to get the CDC to do something about it is a cynical dissenter.
48,40,">The president is the president, and he is the President. It's not a joke. I think he's doing the right thing, it seems."
59,40,This is the kind of thing that you want to suck up about and you're not a racist scumbag?
61,40,I'm surprised that they didn't go around wearing masks to get the message across. The guy who said he wanted to help people in AIDS and he had to wear a mask was a naive jerk.
62,40,"Afaik is a joke, but I feel like the author of that quote is being a complete liar."
68,40,"I'm going to call the joke ""Twitchycon"" because I don't have to wear a mask and have to worry about getting infected. I would be very uncomfortable with not wearing a mask. But I do have a mask I use for my work. So, the best way to keep me from being in my job and taking care of myself."
70,40,"If you're in the US, the president CAN NOT NOT VOTE FOR YOU. That's a very misleading and inaccurate implication."
74,40,We don't just have to have the masks. That's how the CDC works. It doesn't need a restraining order.
86,40,scumbags can be fooled.
87,40,"""Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks."""
89,40,"Vaccination is not a joke, it's an essential part of a health care system. The CDC is suing people who don't wear a mask."

100,40,I don't think the point of the article is that you're being racist.

40,30,"OP, this is not about the ACA. This is about the ACA's failure to stop the spread of a virus."

40,38,This is a joke. He is doing the right thing. You are being racist.
43,40,I hate to think about it but if that's not the case I'm going to be able to tell people the truth. Vaccination isn't a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.
48,40,This isn't the president's joke but it is a joke. The president is a joke and he is the President. This isn't a joke.
59,40,Vaccines are part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

68,40,I've been trying to figure out why so many people don't like to go to Twitchycon.

40,38,"I think you need to get out a lot more. The idea of a ''no mask''' mask in the media, in the context of a joke, makes this one a bit more of a joke. That's why it's not funny to put a mask on."
43,40,"I don't understand what he's trying to say here. That's what the article is referencing. The idea of putting a restraining order against the CDC, and the possibility of getting a lawyer are examples."

40,31,"I don't know. It's a joke. It's a joke, because the idea of a mask is a joke. It's about the fact that the government has no obligation to stop the spread of the disease. It's a joke."
40,38,"If it was a prank, it'd be a joke. It would probably be a joke about the CDC using the masks, and the CDC trying to make a joke about it."
43,40,"It’s a joke, because a joke is a joke."
48,40,It seems like the joke isn't a joke. What the meme is about?
59,40,It's a joke.
61,40,I mean this is the CDC's way of saying it. The first part is pretty much a joke.
62,40,Vaccination is the best way to stop the spread of HIV.
68,40,Vaccination is a vital part of the healthcare system. CDC trolls can make people sick.
70,40,I just lost my face mask. It's like a little piece of cardboard on a wall.
74,40,It's an example of the government failing to address the problem of HIV/AIDS.
86,40,"I know the right is a question of privacy, but... It's just not right."
87,40,This isn't something to worry about. This is going to be the worst thing to do for a Canadian team if they don't have any information about the virus at all.
89,40,So the thing about wearing a mask isn't something the government should be suing people who don't wear a mask. Isn't it something that the government is suing to protect?
91,40,Vaccination is a joke. There are three kinds of jokes. The 'war on the spread of a virus' and the 'I don't care about vaccinations because it doesn't help with that' aren't all the same thing.'
93,40,"""The CIA and the CIA are just a piece of a conspiracy."""
95,40,"A prank about someone who is allergic to a virus is a joke and it's called a prank because a virus is not a joke - but in reality, a joke is one of those things that is considered a joke, it's not a joke at all if you are not familiar with the term ""prank"" in general."
100,40,"I'm pretty sure the title says that ""I'm pretty sure the laws we used were pretty much the same in both countries. Hence, the right to keep locked in, no one wants to walk outside the door."""
40,14,"In Canada the CDC wants people to wear a mask, so it's actually actually the law."
40,15,"""I feel like you are right in your own mind that the CDC is not an anti-vaccination force. They have no obligation to enforce health care laws. They have no moral obligation to enforce them. Vaccination is a joke."""

40,38,"I'm going to be the first to admit that this is a ridiculous joke that makes me mad, because I don't know what it really means."
43,40,That CDC is going to take a joke and make it a joke.
48,40,So that's the joke. What about the government?
59,40,"This is a joke. It's racist, a joke is a joke."
61,40,"I grew up on a farm, so I figured this ACA was a good time for me to learn the basic facts about AIDS, specifically the HIV/AIDS vaccine. I'm surprised to learn the vaccine in fact is in fact effective because it's so widespread it will be wiped out by the CDC."
62,40,"""I don't believe there is actually any evidence to say that 'putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt'"" is a joke. I'm sorry I can't speak to the author."
68,40,...which the CDC has not implemented in decades.
70,40,"I’d go do it, but I’d also go do it, too, because I feel like the idea of an entire body of people being exposed to the virus is a sham."
74,40,I'm gonna come off as too funny.
86,40,The president is going to have to go through a legal process that involves him removing his mask from the CDC's service. If he was a doctor in China he could have done this.
87,40,"I think a few of the people who commented in that section were talking about the fact that if I've been vaccinated at the beginning of this week, I'll just throw it out there."
89,40,"I was referring to the one line in the title as ""I'm just claiming that it's a joke, but I don't think it's the actual joke. I want to tell you, ""That's not a joke. It's an essential part of a health care system. Vaccination is an essential part of a health care system. Isn't it something that the government is suing people who don't wear a mask?

40,14,The CDC doesn't want to be a joke. The CDC is trying to do so by threatening people with a virus by allowing people to be on their site. It's a joke and is supposed to be funny. But the article was about a joke that was actually the joke.
40,15,"I think the point is to get back to you and the public to understand that these pranks have no moral merit. If it's going to be a joke, I'll just rephrase the title in my head:"
40,30,"It isn't a joke, it's a joke."
40,31,"The joke that's coming up is just a joke, in my mind."
40,38,"""It sounds like a joke. It's a joke."""
43,40,I like the idea of being able to tell which side to run to.
48,40,"There is a story on reddit about a president in Africa saying: ""It's about the president, and he is the President. It's about the president."
59,40,The idea is to make the CDC look bad and try to make the president look better. The CDC is not responsible for a CDC-related virus. The article is a joke because it's about the government. It's about the CDC - not the CDC.
61,40,So there is a cliche in the world about a government mandate that prevents AIDS from spreading?
62,40,The president is being a troll.
68,40,"So, the story is really about the ""Fuck the CDC and the ACA. Why do people think it's racist?""?"
70,40,A lot of people don't want to hear this and feel bad for the president because he's racist. A lot of people like the President and the CDC and all their supporters hate it.
74,40,I'm going to be on the front page of /r/politics because I'm not very good at this and don't want to lose anything. It's a joke. I think it's a joke because I'm not very good at it and don't want to lose anything. It's a joke.
86,40,It seems like the Obama administration wants to try and put an end to this for the 'disgusted' ones. It seems like the restraining order is misleading and misleading.
87,40,"A sexy mask isn't really a good idea. You're just thinking about a ""fun"" time."
89,40,A lot of people are in the comments about this. I didn't utter the exact thing as I expected.
91,40,"""Hey, we are in the army. Let me take a look at this, please."""
93,40,...and i'm worried about the consequences of such a thing.
95,40,a prank based on a joke is a prank because it is based on the word sprite
100,40,The article tries to be clear that the message is racist and that people are afraid of consequences.

40,15,">When the US President doesn't agree with a law, a joke gets made and it becomes more funny. So, what if it's a prank to be the CDC's goal?"
40,30,It sounds like the CDC is putting in place something to make it seem like the CDC is a prankster.
40,31,">I see this as a joke. I think it's just a joke, in my mind."
40,38,I was at a conference where people were getting vaccinated and there was an article on the government using the masks to stop the spread of a virus.
43,40,"""I think the best way to stop the spread of a virus is with a mask. That's right. The mask is just an erotic plastic piece that is worn by the players."""
48,40,That's the article OP's addressing. This has been on this thread for months and every article on here is absolutely crap. I don't want to be able to summarize that in a broader context.
59,40,I'm not a racist and I'm not trying to make you look like a troll.
61,40,I think you're gonna get a laugh out of it.
62,40,Vaccination isn’t illegal. It’s not a joke.
68,40,"The article states that if you want a safety concern you have to go to an ER (or to a doctor) or a public health care center, and you're being warned or sicked. You just put on a mask, and your health needs to be checked. Vaccination is really a joke."
70,40,[I have an infection](http://www.associate.ca.gov/departure/infectious_virus).
74,40,"In the US, the CDC doesn't have a restraining order."
86,40,There are a ton of rumors that the Obama administration will do something with the CDC based on his speech in the first place - it seems like there is no legal basis for it.
87,40,"I've been vaccinated for a while and I am a coach in my hometown, and it's not just a hockey one but also a sports one as well."
89,40,"Yes, it is a joke. You can only do so much with a mask, it's a joke, and that's the whole point. Vaccination is an essential part of a health care system. The FDA is suing people who don't wear a mask. It's an essential part of a health care system. Vaccination is an essential part of a health care system."
91,40,That is a pretty weird way to go.
93,40,"It's also interesting that this is a very interesting topic. I think the article is about the CIA and the CIA is just a piece of a conspiracy. I think that it is a big deal that it's about the government. The article suggests that the article is about the CIA and the CIA is just being a ""piece of a conspiracy.""', """"The CIA is a piece of a conspiracy. I think that it is a big deal that it's about the government."
95,40,...so I think people are going to want to be called a prankster.
100,40,I genuinely think the article is a joke if you just can't look it up in this context.
40,14,"As a Canadian who was vaccinated, this was not my first experience of the CDC being a prankster. This is not a joke."
40,15,CANNOTANSWER: I think people are going to want to be called a prankster.
40,30,"I don't think people can understand this kind of thing. A lot of people in the nfl haven't heard about the ACA and are defending the government, but they can think of the law as a joke."
40,31,I don't see why the CDC doesn't have mandates or mandates for all vaccines.
40,38,Well... it's a lot harder to put on a mask and still have a prank on the government.
43,40,"Vaccination is a joke. People in the NFL have a history of defending the government. It is illegal. They can't pretend that it is actually the government, but that's not fair."
48,40,I'm a CDC agent and have done a lot of people's things with them.
59,40,"It is really sad to see this going on, but even when the CDC is supposedly against this virus, people keep on getting sick because of the CDC's propaganda."
61,40,"It's a joke, but not a joke. I'm a doctor, so I don't know why you are so upset about a joke."
62,40,"So the people who are using a mask, even kids, to stop the spread of a virus aren't being snide about it. Getting one in public is a joke about how it is a joke. It's not a joke, it's a joke about the people who are doing it."
68,40,It's very unlikely that a lot of people will ever agree to that. It's possible that this is the case but it's difficult to say.
70,40,"In other words, this joke was a joke, so I think it's better to use it as a joke."
74,40,I’m not a lawyer. I’m a cop.
86,40,The CDC has never done anything against the Obama administration or their staff. They have been trying to do something to stop a virus.
87,40,The quote isn't a part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. What you said is a bit of a joke.
89,40,A twitchcon is a joke because it's an essential part of a health care system. It's an essential part of a health care system. It's an essential part of a health care system. It's an essential part of a health care system.
91,40,That's a joke. And you need to read the whole article to get the narco-narco's point across.
93,40,"""... and i'm worried about the consequences of such a thing. If I'm not mistaken, this is a part of the US sabotage. The CIA isn't a government entity. They are a piece of a conspiracy."
95,40,I can't figure out why people are angry at them.
100,40,Afraid of consequences.
40,14,The CDC is actually trying to make people aware of the virus and that the CDC is trying to act like one.
40,15,"I'm a medical professional and i can say for sure this is not a joke. There's not a way to know what's a joke. Vaccination is not a joke and there are not any facts in this story that can tell you why people are angry about it. The CDC is a joke. It's a joke, and if the CDC are suing people who don't wear a mask, it's a joke. The CDC is suing people who are attempting to stop the spread of a virus."
40,30,He didn't tell anybody about it.
40,31,"A lot of people don't care about the government, especially if they're part of the problem."
40,38,[NAME] is the man who pushed his way into the presidential election. His name is Jesse Jackson and he was on the National Advisory Council of Medical Boards. He was there to be a guy who pranks about vaccinating women.
43,40,"It's just a joke, but they're not trying to be funny or the joke is being funny or the joke is being funny. The jokes aren't funny, but they aren't being jokes. The joke is being a joke."
48,40,Vaccination is a joke because the CDC is trying to stop the spread of a virus.
59,40,Vaccine is the best way to prevent viruses.
61,40,Vaccination is important. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of the virus.
62,40,I'm not a lawyer. I don't want to be a racist. I don't think you should be the one suing the CDC and government over putting people infected.
68,40,I'm pretty sure that you've found this trolls on reddit who are saying they're racist.
70,40,This is a joke in the sense that it's a joke about the government trying to control spread of AIDS.
74,40,This is an old joke. People in these days aren't going to hear it until they're in a relationship.
86,40,They are trying to block HIV and the CDC. I am sure if they didn't pass a law they'd take away the ability to control them.
87,40,"> We need to get a sexy mask, and then get vaccinated."
89,40,"They need to do something about this. A twitchcon and the ""invasion of the government is a joke"". The government should do everything possible to help stop this. And it should not be ignored. The FDA is suing the people for not wearing a mask."
91,40,"As an Army student and a military veteran, I know a lot of people who think 'I don't care about vaccinations because it doesn't help with that' aren't going to 'get the vaccines'."
93,40,I'm also concerned that the CIA and the CIA are a piece of a conspiracy.
95,40,"I think OP's describing a joke is a lot of stuff. he doesn't look very funny in a prank, he seems kind of rude and inappropriate if he doesn't say it. You could say, ""I am allergic to the virus."" ""Some people get it. I am allergic to the virus. I have to go for a nosebleed or breathe a few times a week to breathe normally. I have to have a nosebleed to breathe properly, which varies wildly."
100,40,> I am not a racist. The president is racist
40,14,Vaccination is actually a joke because he's talking about a government attempt to stop the spread of the virus.
40,15,Because you're so ignorant of everything that's being discussed in a lot of this thread.
40,30,"... You're being a troll, and you're being a troll. You're being a troll, and you're being a troll."
40,31,I have a hard time believing the person I'm referring to is racist.
40,38,"A prank is a joke. A joke is the idea that you don't know what a joke is and you don't want to learn it. I'm going to be the first to admit that this is a joke that makes me mad, because I don't know what it really means."
43,40,"Vaccination is a joke, and it isn't just a joke. The government is trying to make a joke out of it, not some shady and uninformed joke."
48,40,"I'm not sure if that's the correct term for the joke that was being used. But, I was just using the euphemism."
59,40,We need to rethink our priorities for the next year. It's going to be a LOT more interesting and not very good for the nation.
61,40,So there's this question to answer here.
62,40,Assuming he actually wanted to go against the law he could sue the CDC for it.
68,40,"The article isn't racist, it's racist because they are a bunch of trolls."
70,40,"The CDC has a lot of authority over what the CDC is doing. I am concerned they don't actually have authority over things that aren't done by the CDC. So they are trying to control spread of AIDS. This is all a joke about it, and a joke, in the sense of the president being the one who is trying to control the disease. This is a joke about the president."
74,40,"I've seen people talk about the issue of wearing a mask, but I think it's a good idea. It's a joke, and it's not actually the issue, its just a prank. I don't think it's funny."

93,40,I am sorry you're so confused about this.

40,30,You're being a troll. You're being a troll.
40,31,"It's all a joke, because it's a joke, because it's funny."
40,38,"That is not a joke, it is a prank."
43,40,No one likes the president and they are trying to take a joke out of it.
48,40,I don't see how the guy is still using the joke he was talking about. I'm not sure what the joke is.
59,40,"If you are in the NFL and have a game with the Packers, they've probably been doing very well since they were in office."
61,40,>They need to go to a party to stop the spread of the virus.

40,38,"Then I don't think you should be able to answer the questions about ""why are you talking about vaccines?"". But what's not a joke is that people have to buy and maintain their vaccination program and wear it to prevent spread of a virus. They should be safe for those who have vaccinated and are protected from HIV."
43,40,Vaccination isn't a joke. It is a joke.
48,40,"Is it the presidents, abolitionists or any other party that has already committed to using'masks and masks to protect people' from the disease?

86,40,"People who aren't a doctor are the ones who do the most defamation, and it is not a good idea for them to ask someone to take a restraining order because they think they're doing it wrong."
87,40,I've been vaccinated for over 10 years now and I'm still having issues with it. I have been vaccinated three times now. This is because I have a mask on if I am travelling.
89,40,"I'm not even sure I'm even funny enough to actually look at this in a serious way. It's been very well written, it's clear that there are some other things going on in a society that have something like this. The CDC hasn't changed much except for the very recent 'twitchcon', but the new one is pretty bad."
91,40,">Hey, we are in the army. Let me take a look at this, please.''"
93,40,"No trolls. No trolls. This isn't the US government, but it is the US government."
95,40,It is also a joke because it is based on a joke. It is based on a joke.
100,40,"""We are just going to go ahead and put up with an issue about the President. It's a joke, but not a joke. I think a lot of this is from someone who didn't know the President."""
40,14,The article has been a rip off of the original and is going to get much more criticized.
40,15,Vaccination is not a joke. The CDC has no obligation to enforce health care laws. They have no moral obligation to enforce them. Vaccination is a joke.
40,30,It's a joke and is not a joke. It's a joke and isn't about the government.
40,31,This isn't about the government. The government is trying to protect people by not doing what it thinks is a great idea.
40,38,"The whole joke is based off a misunderstanding, not a joke."
43,40,"The phrase ""As a CDC patient, I would be happy if my team had a full year and then I'd have a restraining order against them."". I'm sorry he's a dick. In this particular case, it’s a joke."
48,40,"If a doctor believes an outbreak can be prevented, they can recommend that the patient have an oral antiseptic that has been proven to be safe for many."
59,40,It's the right way to go. The right way. It's not racist at all.
61,40,It sounds like you are being incredibly harsh. They are trying to make you think that it is a joke.
62,40,He's bringing a real threat to our future. He's letting himself be called an asshole for using it.
68,40,"A ""smoker joke""."
70,40,"Then, if it was in a joke, it would have to be very stupid if it was a joke."
74,40,It's a joke and not a joke. The government is doing nothing about stopping the spread of a virus. They are trying to keep people safe. They are trying to get the public to buy the CDC's Vaccination Act. It's not as effective as the original restraining order. They want to keep the public safe.
86,40,The Obama administration is trying to control the world with restraining orders.
87,40,">We'll have to get a sexy, mask a mask, and then get vaccinated."
89,40,"There is no joke that is a joke. The CDC is suing people who don't wear a mask for that reason, and they are suing the people who don't wear a mask because they have no idea what a virus is."
91,40,The US government is being manipulated by the US government to make the vaccines available to people. Vaccination is a joke because the CDC needs to be used by the government to prevent this.
93,40,The CIA has nothing to do with the CIA. They do not have any control over it. They only have a certain power to restrict its access to sex in foreign countries.
95,40,He was attempting to make fun of a person who was allergic to a virus. He was actually having a hard time breathing because of his allergies. He said it was a joke about the virus and it would be a joke about the sprite.

40,38,"You’re all being racist, you’re a troll and you’re trying to get people to get vaccinated and a prank."
43,40,Vaccination is a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke because of the fact that the CDC is trying to get the CDC to do something about it. The CDC is attempting to make the joke joke about it.
48,40,"The joke was actually part of the effort to stop the spread of the virus.It's not a joke, but it's a joke."
59,40,I'm a doctor in the NFL.
61,40,>the issue is that people are stupid. Not if the sexes themselves are not vaccinated.
62,40,>The government is trying to sue the CDC and the CIA because it is illegal.
68,40,Vaccination is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. Because the CDC isn't supporting the government.
70,40,I don't really want to see a new president but the president is a joke.
74,40,It's a joke and not a joke. The government is trying to stop the spread of the virus.
86,40,"The CDC is trying to stop the spread of a virus by allowing some of those people to get sick. The CDC is trying to prevent a virus that is not HIV, a dangerous illness, and a disease in many parts of the US."
87,40,"In a lot of situations, it's not a 'bad' idea to get the vaccinated. That said, it's not something I care about. Vaccination is a regressive measure and not a cure. It's a regressive measure, and not a cure. A regressive measure can't be used to prevent a virus from spreading. It's a cynical premise."
89,40,"It's pretty funny, and I don't think that the whole thing is worth going to a show."
91,40,"It seems to be a misunderstanding, and it was kind of obvious that he was trying to make a joke about it, and was being funny about it."
93,40,This is the US government's newest propaganda campaign.
95,40,What if I said I'm allergic to the sprite??
100,40,"People in the White House wring up the shit out of their heads at all times, especially when it comes to an issue they're talking about and being told they can't be as ignorant as they seem."
40,14,Afaik is a prank.
40,15,I'm not sure why people are so upset about this. I think that the point of this post is to make people understand that the CDC is suing people who don't wear a mask.
40,30,">People in the NFL have a history of defending the government, but that's not fair."
40,31,"A lot of people don't care about the government. It's a joke, because I think it's a joke. The CDC and CDC haven't even discussed vaccines. Vaccination is a joke, and it's an attempt to prevent the spread of a virus."
40,38,"If I'm not mistaken, the CDC is using the vaccines to stop the spread of syphilis. They're using them to prevent that."
43,40,Vaccination is illegal. It isn't just a joke. It is a joke because of the fact that the CDC is trying to get the CDC to do something about it.
48,40,It is not a joke. It is a joke because it is in the act of protecting people.
59,40,"I’m not a doctor and I have no idea what the CDC is doing to stop this, but it’s not about me. The CDC is trying to stop it but i’m not a racist. They are trying to stop it."
61,40,You are being incredibly harsh. They are trying to make you think that it is a joke. You are being extremely harsh.
62,40,He's being a troll and his attempts to take advantage of people's concerns were a joke. He wasn't trying to stop the spread of AIDS by using a mask. He was trying to bring the government out of the situation.
68,40,"A lot of people do not like the ACA, the CDC and the ACA's goals, but it's racist. This is what the article says about the ACA. It's racist, because it's not racist."
70,40,"I'd rather not have any type of sex with someone because they're going through a lot of pain, and it's a fucking horrible feeling and just a bit depressed."
74,40,"Is there any way i can get a restraining order that says you can wear a mask, but your right that's illegal?"
86,40,I do not know about your comments and I doubt you're really serious about preventing people from getting infected.
87,40,"Isn't that what the title says? ""We'll have to get a sexy mask, and then get vaccinated. If we can afford to get vaccinated, we'll have to get a sexy mask and then get vaccinated."""
89,40,So... I am saying that it’s a joke because it’s an essential part of a health care system.
91,40,"I don't think that's a joke. There are plenty of people who think they're hilarious, and they think they're hilarious."
93,40,"I just read an article about Obama being involved in the Bush administration. The article describes the CIA's policies on the subject, specifically ""preventing"" the spread of AIDS."
95,40,"[As a prankster myself, it's important that this is a joke. I've always wondered why someone would say they're allergic to a virus when they have some. Unless you are allergic to a virus, then you are allergic to the virus."
100,40,"So, after the first post of the ""Midnight Guy"" I don't have any idea what you mean."

40,15,Are you a doctor? Is it a joke?
40,30,"i think it's the right thing to do because they know the problem, i think it's a joke and it's what you get when you're in the minority"
40,31,>The point of this post is to make people understand that the government is trying to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.Afaik is a joke.
40,38,>We have the same rights as people in other parts of the world and we have to get them.
43,40,"People in the NFL have a history of defending the government. It is illegal. They can't pretend that it is actually the government, but that's not a joke."
48,40,">I know I'm on the top tier of the list, but the first is that it's too far to get it."
59,40,The CDC is not responsible for anything. This is one of the big reasons it isn't legal in the USA to ban sex in public. It also isn't just a joke.
61,40,I'm going to say this to the reader. The first one is about a joke:
62,40,“The CDC is suing me because I believe in them. I do not think the CDC is going to sue me for anything that they have to do with what I am being a joke about. I am not a lawyer.
68,40,Because he hasn't even seen the article.
70,40,"I am going to have to make a note that you can’t even say “I’d rather not have sex with someone because I’m going through a lot of pain, and it’s a fucking horrible feeling and just a bit depressed. I’m going to give you the joke” that isn’t “my mask is on” and you can say “I wear it on my face”"
74,40,>I'm gonna come off as too funny. I think it's a joke. I think it's a joke. I think it's a joke.
86,40,"... ""If you're going to say the CDC's restraining order is misleading and misleading. The fact that Obama's restraining order is misleading and misleading."
87,40,I think the quote is a bit misleading. They are trying to prevent the spread of a virus. They are trying to prevent the spread of it.
89,40,"You just describe a joke that comes up in the show with no context. Especially since a lot of people who don't have it like that think the CDC is in the wrong. It's like saying ""I don't like going to the CDC show because it's an important part of a health care system."", ""I don't want to go to the show because it's an important part of a health care system."""
91,40,I have not been vaccinated in a while. What was the point of this joke?
93,40,"The article has been posted more than 1 million times on the front page, a lot of people are not even rereading the entire article in order to understand why it is called a conspiracy."
95,40,It's a joke because it is based on a joke and is called a joke.
100,40,What's the joke about?
40,14,I can't imagine the joke being a joke that the CDC would want to make.
40,15,I was not a doctor. I was a virologist at a med school.
40,30,... a lot of people who have not been vaccinated have reread this post. This isn't a joke because the Obama administration is inaction on the ACA. It's about a joke.
40,31,[NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME]
40,38,Because they have no moral obligation to enforce the law. They have no obligation to have it enforced.
43,40,>Isn't the CDC making it illegal for people to wear masks when it is in the process of making a ban on them?
48,40,"I'm sure it's a good one. But you know what, I'm not sure what it means."
59,40,>What if this article says the president is going to try to sabotage this shit by allowing the CDC to ban syphilis?
61,40,Vaccination is an important part of the healthcare system. They are not doing anything to stop it from happening. They are doing something to prevent it. Vaccination is an important part of the health system.
62,40,Why do people think that putting on a mask is a joke?
68,40,I'm a lawyer who's a doctor. It's not a joke. It's racist.
70,40,It's racist to assume that the president was a shaman or that he was trying to sabotage the CDC because the CDC is a racist.
74,40,Vaccination vs. protection is a good idea.
86,40,''That's what a restraining order is for.
87,40,"I think a lot of this is coming from an Australian perspective. The wording of this sentence is essentially incorrect, and a lot of it is misleading."
89,40,> 'Almost like you're a narcissist and don't want to wear a mask
91,40,Vaccination is an essential part of protecting against the spread of a virus. They are the CDC. They are the CDC. They are the CDC. They are the CDC.
93,40,>I think it is a big deal that it's about the government.
95,40,"A prank is just a joke based on a joke based on a joke, it is not a joke. It is based on a joke and it is called a joke. It is also a joke because it is based on a joke and it is called a joke."

40,14,"If you have a prank in mind, don't write it."
40,15,>I'm a medical professional and i can say for sure this isn't a joke.
40,30,"""There's no implication of ""I think it's a joke. It is an important part of the healthcare system. They are not doing anything to stop the spread of the virus. They are the CDC. They are the CDC. They are the CDC. They are the CDC. They are the CDC. They are the CDC. They are the CDC. They are the CDC. They are the CDC. They are the CDC."
40,31,">If the CIA and NSA were preventing sex, what would they do?', ""I know it was written in the 1950s, but they've been in the news all along."","
40,38,I don't think it's a prank.
43,40,It's a joke.
48,40,"The problem is that the president isn't doing sex, he's doing what he wants to do, because he wants to make himself better. That's a joke."

61,40,"So I don't think you've ever heard the same thing. But you're probably right if the joke isn't racist because you don't think the joke is racist and it's just going to be funny. The CDC, CDC and TWickCon are being cliches about how racist the CDC is."
62,40,The President is being a troll. It doesn’t seem like he has any authority over the government.
68,40,The CDC is trying to make healthcare available to people in the US. They are not supporting it. They support it. They have no obligation to enforce them.
70,40,I'm just saying that what you're saying is completely ridiculous. What are you trying to say?
74,40,There are a lot of pranks at this point but this is not the worst.
86,40,"In the US, a restraining order only works for a few months. The CDC isn't helping in this. It's also a government agency and their employees aren't working with the CDC unless they have permission."
87,40,"I know the premise but it's all good. Is it actually good? It sounds sexist, but the premise behind this one is that the vaccine is an abolition of a vaccine because it's too dangerous for kids to get it. There are no laws protecting it against it, and while it can be very effective against it, it isn't a cure, it can be a regressive measure."
89,40,"It seems a little off to me because I think the issue is that I'm arguing a joke against the idea of a mask, instead of a joke based on the 'What's the matter here?'."
91,40,The government is putting out vaccines for the sick. The federal government essentially is sending a message that all the sick people in the army need to be vaccinated.
93,40,"""The CIA is a piece of a conspiracy."""
95,40,"I don't know if a prankster would be upset that the government hasn't made it a joke, because he made it for an audience that he could probably keep for himself. What they really are referring to is that they have a very, very specific definition of a joke, not based on a joke."
100,40,"""President, I am not a racist, because I'm not a racist, because I have the gist of the entire situation."
40,14,"As I said above, it's not going to be a joke."
40,15,"It's not a joke, but it is a joke. The CDC is trying to make healthcare available to all people, and it isn't a joke."
40,30,"A lot of people are thinking it's a joke, but they're going to be confused by it. They're actually not being a prankster."
40,31,The CDC can't make a joke out of you. They are not trying to prevent it. The CDC is trying to stop it.
40,38,I would be angry with people who are trying to make the prank a prank because of their own lack of empathy and respect. I do not think I'm a racist.
43,40,The president has made a very clear statement that he is not really interested in helping prevent this issue. The government is just trying to get rid of it.
48,40,"What I'm saying is that, while you could've put on a mask and gone through your restaraunt, it's not a joke. It's a joke and a joke that isn't a joke. It's a joke because it isn't a joke. It's a joke because it is in the act of protecting people. It's a joke."
59,40,"They're trying to sabotage a terrorist attack by allowing them to use syphilis vaccines. That's a very dangerous situation, which isn't an anti-vaccine concept."
61,40,I feel like a lot of people would be offended. But I'm not offended because it's a joke.
62,40,It's not a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. The president is trying to sue the CDC for it.
68,40,I had a doctor tell me that I wasn't going to go to the show and had to wear a mask because it was the best way to keep me afloat and in my job.
70,40,"There's also the rumor that it's a good idea to take off a mask when you go to work, or even when you come in to work."
74,40,I have to admit I find this hilariously tame.
86,40,I think you'll see the aforementioned comments when you read them all.
87,40,"""The CDC is trying to prevent the spread of a virus. They are trying to prevent the spread of a virus. They are trying to prevent the spread of a virus. They want to get to know the people who don't know how to do things."
89,40,"What do you mean ""Mask me a question""?"
91,40,"Yes, the CDC is wrong, but there are other things that CDC is wrong, and it's going to help prevent this."
93,40,What's a conspiracy?
95,40,Is it not the same prank that the title makes fun of?
100,40,... I feel like I have a pretty hard time understanding this.
40,14,"Why do people think this is a joke? The government seems to think that it's a joke, and not to prevent the spread of a virus."
40,15,"""We're getting vaccines in the US. CDC is suing people who don't wear a mask to help stop the spread of a virus. It's a joke. It's a joke because it is in the act of protecting people. It's a joke because it is in the act of protecting people. It's a joke because it is a joke. They are trying to stop the spread of a virus. That's a very dangerous situation. What's a joke?"
40,30,>I would be angry with people who are trying to make the prank a prank because of their own lack of empathy and respect. I do not think I'm a racist.
40,31,This is the most offensive thing I've read in a long time. The person who says the joke is tame. The guy with a mask that you don't want to wear in a public place seems a bit like the president.
40,38,The CIA and the CDC are making a joke about this.
43,40,The CDC is trying to discredit the government's policies and prevent the spread of AIDS. They are just trying to discredit the government and try to discredit the CDC. They are a joke.
48,40,The problem is that the president isn't doing sex as a means to protect people.

61,40,What is the purpose of a mask? The purpose of a mask is to stop the spread of the virus and prevent infection. It's also a joke.
62,40,Why would a lawyer want to sue the CDC for something he had done?
68,40,"This is the kind of post that just started. I don't know where to look now, but this is just a random post that I saw on a forum a few days ago."
70,40,It's actually an amazing joke. It's not about it but about the CDC. It's all about having people spouting out jokes.
74,40,[NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME
86,40,The President wants to control this epidemic so he can get his hands on some more restraining orders.
87,40,"Vaccination for a virus isn’t the best way to prevent the spread of it, it’s not the best way to prevent people from getting sick and get vaccinated, it’s the best way to prevent the spread of a virus. It’s a regressive measure and not a cure, but it’s a regressive measure. It’s a regressive measure, and it’s not a cure."
89,40,Then you should go. They're suing people who don't wear a mask.
91,40,"That's all. Not a joke, and not a joke."
93,40,"This is not a conspiracy, this is a piece of a conspiracy."
95,40,"I grew up in the U.S., and my mom was allergic to the sprite. I have had a great experience with this, and my gf was allergic to the sprite. I had a really bad time and my mom told me that it was a joke about a virus and it had been spread for years. Eventually the only way to get over it was with a prank. I was all over it, and my mom was allergic, I could not go without the mask. I would ask her if there is something a joke about"
100,40,I think it's a good point.

59,40,"It is a joke and a joke because the article says the president is going to try to sabotage it, but they are trying to stop it, and despite the joke, they are trying to sabotage it."
61,40,I just read about a joke from a newspaper about being a naive fool.
62,40,"I love reading about this. Especially because it makes me think that it is a joke, but it is a joke about people being uncomfortable with the idea that it will cause AIDS. It is a joke about the idea of being able to stop the spread of the disease, and that he is not able to prevent it or a virus from spreading in an unprovoked way."
68,40,"I'd say that the CDC is attempting to make it easier to access health care, preventing this from happening. They have a very different definition of a joke than ""I don't wear a mask"" (see [https://www.nhs.gov/health/communican/news/articles/ebola_the_failure_to_get_vaccine_if_fail_I](https://www.mtmc.gov/health/communican/news/doc/doc/index.html"
70,40,CANNOTANSWER: I'm really looking forward to this podcast.
74,40,So what's a prank? It's a prank?
86,40,"It's the CDC who is trying to stop this. It's not the president, it's a country."
87,40,So you're saying a regressive measure is not a good idea?
89,40,"There are 2 different types of masks available, and it is the same thing. One is a mask in case someone is sick, another is a mask to protect against a virus. One isn't meant to prevent a virus from spreading but to prevent the spread of a virus. One is to prevent a virus from spreading to people infected with the virus."
91,40,"Is the point of a joke. If the military can't get vaccines, the government can't just give a go."
93,40,This is a conspiracy theory.
95,40,"""Pay-I was allergic to a virus."

86,40,"This isn't the real question here. The actual question is whether or not the government is trying to stop the spread of a virus or not, and why does that even exist. I'm not sure how we can get a government to stop the spread of that virus, but the whole point of the restraining order is to stop it. It's in line with the point of it being trying to keep the spread going, that's what I think he's trying to do. Is this a joke?"
87,40,"> We need to get a sexy mask, and then get vaccinated."

40,14,CANNOTANSWER:
40,15,"I think that the joke is about the government suing people who don't wear a mask. The CDC is trying to slander them, but they don't know anything about it and they have no moral obligation to enforce it."

40,38,"Yes, if you're racist, you're a racist."
43,40,Why do you think that the CDC is trying to stop a viral infection?
48,40,It's a joke. They say it's a joke because it's intended to stop the spread of AIDS. It's a joke because it's intended to stop the spread of AIDS.
59,40,...which the CDC is trying to sue over.

91,40,Vaccination is a joke because of the CDC.
93,40,I'm so confused about this.
95,40,"There's a very real difference between prank and joke. If you think it's a joke, it's a joke. If it's a joke, it's a joke."
100,40,"The issue is that many people like the Obama stance on HIV/AIDS but that they don't understand it or that the White House itself is racist because of its political affiliations. They think this is a joke to talk about the president, and that that's a joke to explain why you don't understand this, and that they're being racist based on it. It's not a joke, it's a joke."
