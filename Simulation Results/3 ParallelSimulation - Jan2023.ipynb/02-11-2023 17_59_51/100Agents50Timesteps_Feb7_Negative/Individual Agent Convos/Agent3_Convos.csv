13,3,I'm not sure if you have had the opportunity to try out a mask if your face didn't look like a mask.
14,3,"It's one of the most misleading, and ridiculous fucking policies in history. I wouldn't put up with that kind of nonsense."
27,3,"i was trying to write about this, but they just wanted me to write something like 'I got one in my pocket now and it's all covered up now'."

94,3,"I will get them off. Then a couple of days after they come out, I will ask them to change their masks."
13,3,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i ve done in my entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things Little blue ones are totally useless.Even the best don't work very well.Even the best don't work very well.Events
14,3,"It's very simple. It's not like anyone's going to wear a mask anymore, it's not like that's what the public will do, and it's not the person's choice. It is an easy way to put a stop to that kind of behavior."
27,3,The truth about a face mask is... it is not just a thing to be in a mask.
38,3,"You don't know what elitist means. You said the game is a joke, but it's a real thing."
49,3,That mask is not a fake or anything.
52,3,"It's a scam, because it's part of the measures deployed by the government to stop the spread of a virus."
58,3,There's no way to stop them from wearing masks. I think they are just not a good idea. It's really not like a good idea.
59,3,>You know our right to die and infect (kill) others. Why isn't Ms. Ingraham out there with them? And they're the ones holding the apologies. Vaccines will also be the way to go.
69,3,"Wearing a mask and not wearing a mask is a scam, because it ruins your life."
94,3,"I'm sorry but I'm not the official vaccinated coach - I work in a team based on the vaccination, and I'm not a team official - but I've been told by a guy who is the player who's only vaccinated is the head coach - you are an idiot. It's like a kid wearing a mask when his face gets infected and there's no air in there."
13,3,"I would be more of a cliche to say that they are the ""stymies"" of the government, but that they are still using a mask. You say you are sick and the people who are being raped are the ones who are being debunked by some people? If you don't know the facts then I don't see any problems with that."
14,3,"I'm not sure I understand the sentiment, but this is an ad hominem and the government isn't really doing anything wrong, which means a lot of people get sick and can't seem to get the virus out of their system."
27,3,People wearing masks are usually sexist and sexist. Is it possible a person is ostracized by someone without a mask?
38,3,There's a really good thread that explains all of this.
49,3,'It's actually only a scam because the mask is on a computer.'
52,3,"A lot of people are in general allergic to their helmets, and people can be assholes at a very young age."
58,3,"If you want to protect yourself, a prankster is not a good idea. Putting on a mask is a crime and a very bad idea."
59,3,"I'm afraid the point of this subreddit is just that people don't realize that if they were trying to make it all about the ACA, they would be wrong."
69,3,> What’s the point of wearing a mask if you’re allergic to a virus?
94,3,"IANAL, but when they ask me if I'm the official vaccinated coach I tell them I don't have to wear a mask and the answer is no, they just don't care."
13,3,I have one of the only people I care about. I work in an anti-virus community and have done many other things to prevent it from spread.
14,3,The mask is the easiest and most expensive thing to have on a day to day basis. It's not that the government is a bad idea.
27,3,"Considering the length of time a person is going to die, it could be a really long time to wear a mask. It's really scary how dumb they think all of is."
38,3,What's the point of a mask?
49,3,"A nut case is a nut. Its an insult, not a scam."
52,3,"I don't think anyone here has ever been able to find evidence of a helmet safety defect. I think anyone who is in the military would be able to afford to buy a mask to stop someone getting a virus. It would be a good idea to show them the mask and give them an explanation for their behavior. This is a really good one. Its not a scam, but it is a scam to get the helmet. I think you should see a physician, or even a teacher about it."
58,3,Obama has a problem with putting on a mask. It can be a great way to show off his strength and influence.
59,3,"In the context of the Obama Administration, I think the ACA is a great opportunity to help us keep the population safe."
69,3,>I don't know why a politician would take such a harsh and egregious approach to public safety.
94,3,CANNOTANSWER NOW ABOUT THE PURPLE?
13,3,So... The CDC is trying to sabotage the spread of a virus by disallowing a person to put on a mask at the first sign of a sick person.
14,3,"""What is a scam, isn't it? I don't want to be a government spy, and the CDC isn't doing anything wrong. I think the whole idea of wearing a mask in public places is just to protect someone's health."
27,3,"I've been wearing masks for almost 2 months and it's still not working, and that's what they're saying."
38,3,"OP, I've already had your story: ""I'm an immigrant who has no right to wear a mask in my office. I've just been using one for two years. That's not a good idea."""
49,3,"It's not a scam, it's a prank. You can be infected with anything. A virus that's infected means someone can get it, or they can get it. The joke that makes a doctor think it's a scam, doesn't have the same meaning. You're a nut."
52,3,It’s a good point.
58,3,People wear masks to shit on the CIA.
59,3,Is there a difference between a troll and a narcissist who isn't even that racist.
69,3,They're actually more dangerous to the public than the football team.
94,3,"I can't even believe the fact that people can only do this for a few days. Surely the 'no'rule is a good thing, since it's so common to do something stupid that you can't even do it."
13,3,I think 'putting on a mask at the first sign of a sick person' sounds pretty good. But it's not about sabotage... it's about preventing it from spreading.
14,3,"So, if you’re not a prankster, then you should be. It’s a bad idea. People need to be willing to get vaccinated with the right kind of mask. And when you make that choice, they’ll be willing to be abused. They’ll be willing to put up with the idea of a public health sleaze in public places."
27,3,"...and yet... the problem is not only that sexism is a disease, but that sexism is a health risk for all. It can be very dangerous for sexism, and for that reason it is unreliable."
38,3,if you have a mask you can use it at home to help a sick person.
49,3,"CANNOTANSWER. The CDC has done little to stop a virus spreading, it's a huge omission. They have been taking precautions and bringing vaccines in the past to protect people with a virus."
52,3,"I think a lot of people whose parents and kids are actually military have not considered the medical issue as a legitimate legitimate problem. He’s an obstinate dick. He’s a good person, but the government can’t do anything about this. He’s a very serious issue. I think it’s a good point. A lot of people whose parents and kids are actually military have not considered the medical issue as a legitimate legitimate problem. He’s a good person, but the government can’t do anything about this."
58,3,Obama wears a mask to protect himself and the military. It is a joke and a bad idea.
59,3,> The fact that he doesn't wear a mask at the start of the play shows that there isn't enough information to tell if this is a really bad idea.
69,3,This is just a r/againstthereddit post with some dumb jokes.
94,3,"I think it's a little bit BS to believe that they have to change their masks. Vaccination is the worst thing that can happen to a human being and therefore, is a bad thing. I think it's not a bad thing to think of it as ""one of those things that we can't see through the hive, despite a lot of the warning signs from the US."""
13,3,"I believe that the US has a good number of national anti-virus vaccination programs in place, with a number of similar ones."
14,3,"It is a scam, because it is a fraud. There are a lot of people who want to keep their heads and mouths shut by the idea of a public health sleaze and it isn't worth mentioning because I can't really give the facts about the scam - that's for sure."
27,3,It seems the most effective way to keep people from slipping into a new disease is to use it on themselves. I wouldn't want it in the first place because it would make people fuck up.
38,3,CANNOTANSWER: The CDC and the US government are promoting vaccines that are supposed to stop the spread of the virus. It's not just about the government. They’re promoting vaccines that are supposed to stop the spread of the virus. It’s not just about the government.
49,3,"They don't want people to think about vaccination, they want people to think about getting an infection because it's a scam."
52,3,"You are in a different place. A coach should be able to use his masks and gloves to not get any more serious infections. The only thing a doctor would do is to give you the helmet if you are allergic to any of it, not just give the players a warning."
58,3,The only reason to not have a hat is because I'm a political junkie who doesn't understand how government can't put on a mask.
59,3,"He doesn't have a mask. The CDC doesn't have a mask. I don't think that is an actual way to prevent the spread of a virus. If it's not a valid one, I don't think that he needs to wear a mask."
69,3,I would be in trouble for not wearing the mask.
94,3,Why can't you wear your dick to the field and see the hive?
13,3,You are not being harsh. You are just being a clichsy.
14,3,"""We have a great job at proving what it means."""
27,3,"There is a lot of controversy in this thread about this, like this:"
38,3,"I don't know what a mask is, but I think it's a bit odd. There's some of the rules that are being followed in the US, but it doesn't imply that people are right or wrong."
49,3,"I don't really want to be told I am being raped, I want to be the kid in the house - unless I live in a town where a person with a viral infection can get one."
52,3,"This is the first time I've read a comment that I am offended because of a joke. I don't know what the actual actual reason is, but I think the answer here isn't really that bad."
58,3,"I think the fucking huffington post is misleading. The president is on a plane with the president's family and is on the plane, but he's on a plane, and he is the president and he's talking with him, saying something like ""That was a joke"" and saying it's a joke and a bad idea."
59,3,So the jokes are not a good thing?
69,3,This isn't funny.
94,3,"""We are talking about the government being scummy and don't really care."" """
13,3,"You're right. I think it's funny to say that these aren't in the US, but that the US doesn't have the same amount of security protections that the rest of the country has, especially the US."
14,3,"In short: If you want to protect someone's health (and people get sick, you can have a fake virus or a fake infection if you want to) a mask, the CDC isn't doing anything wrong. They're just trying to show people they're bringing this up on the internet."
27,3,"I was in a CDC ad and he had a great interview with the CDC. I went to the doctor, told them it was really good and if they don't, they are going to come out with an actual vaccine. He is using it as a way of preventing the spread of a virus. They had a really good interview with the CDC, and he actually explained it to me."
38,3,"It doesn't make sense, as I've seen all of the comments, including this one, just because of it. It's also not as easy as you think it is. And the only reason it's even a joke is because it's a joke."
49,3,The CDC is in charge of the vaccination process. Vaccination is a law.
52,3,This is a joke about the use of drugs to prevent the spread of HIV.
58,3,I have been with the White House for almost three years. It seems like this post has been made up a little bit to make it a little more interesting.
59,3,"I think it's a good idea to say that we haven't reacted adequately with the ACA (just because it doesn't work well in the US). Vaccines aren't good, because they're not safe."
69,3,As long as the guy on his team wasn't infected then they are putting a fucking nut on his back.
94,3,I'd be very worried about this being a problem for them if they didn't care about the problem.
13,3,Yes. The whole thing is a scam.
14,3,I don't want to see the government bringing this up in the internet.
27,3,">Hey, I'm a criminal that's a criminal. I'm not a racist, but I agree with everything the other guy said in his post."
38,3,So the point of the post is to get your life out of that state and get out of that situation as quickly as possible. That's crazy. You suck at it.
49,3,">I hate when people call the cops on us for wearing a mask at events because we aren't allowed to get vaccinated. They say that is going to have trouble breathing when they want to, and because of this they're doing it. The whole thing is a scam. I don't think I'm gonna be able to get a hold of any of these people, it would be a pretty good way to do so."
52,3,"I've had to be vaccinated, but I've been in the military. I don't want a hiccup. I just want to prank."
58,3,The President's mask is a joke that has a very different meaning.
59,3,I'm not sure if you mean I mean I'm a fucking joke or not. I've said that I was genuinely concerned about how a joke is considered a joke.
69,3,Well the one I'm looking for...
94,3,They've got to stop hating on the players!
13,3,"People putting on masks is not really a scam. I’d say there’s probably a lot of fake news around here about the CDC and the CDC’s anti-viral vaccine programs. If they’re going to sabotage the spread of HIV, it’s important for them to inform people that you’re being raped and are not getting the vaccine. If they’re going to use it as an excuse to get sick, I’d think it’s not a scam."
14,3,It's actually illegal to have a mask in public places because it doesn't work. You just wear it and there are no gov't agencies or organizations who will do it. And this doesn't really make sense.
27,3,"[David Davis](http://www.amazon.com/news/2014/07/david_david_david_david_dad_because) cites a few statistics from his recent posts, including his citation for ""Infected by a virus"":"

49,3,"""The whole thing is a scam. I don't think I'm gonna be able to get a hold of any of these people, it would be a pretty good way to do so."""
52,3,This is a sexist joke. It's like saying you're going to have to be in jail for being able to use the helmet to stop the spread of HIV/VHC.
58,3,"As someone who is a democrat and has been with the White House for nearly three years, I would be concerned about that."
59,3,"""...because this isn't what is a joke about."""
69,3,"The point of putting on a mask is to get him vaccinated. If it wasn't a joke, I'd be in trouble for not wearing it."
94,3,"The ""moon hive"" is a joke. It's the game of ""devil wears masks"" where people wear masks that they're not in the game, with no evidence of vaccinations. I'm not sure how the ""moon hive"" works or how it can stop the hive itself."
13,3,He was a troll about the CDC. That's funny.
14,3,"The article isn't a joke, it's just a joke. It's a joke."
27,3,"'And yet... the problem is not only that sexism is a disease, but that sexism is a health risk for all. It can be very dangerous for sexism, and for that reason it is unreliable.'"
38,3,It's a troll trying to get his message across.
49,3,">They don't want people to think about vaccination, they want people to think about getting an infection because it's a scam."
52,3,"That's just the best way to treat a medical issue, doesn't it? I'm not gonna go out there in a hat and say 'Hey I need to get my shit together.' I'm an official. I've got no fucking clue why that was a joke."
58,3,You may be wondering why Obama is putting on a mask to prevent a virus. He's wearing a mask to protect himself and the military. His mask is a joke.
59,3,The NSA is not a racist organization that is trying to push people to stop their syphilis. It's the government that is preventing them from having sex with other people. The only way to stop it is through legal action.
69,3,So they do something about the people in this sub.
94,3,You should tell your boss what to do? I don't want the job as the GM to take responsibility for the health of his players.

14,3,It's not a joke at all. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.
27,3,I'm trying to write this down because if you are not a lawyer you are an asshole.
38,3,This guy has no right to wear a mask. The problem is that people can't stop the spread of the virus. He is a medical doctor. And I don't think he's racist because they don't know what a mask is and what a mask isn't.
49,3,"The CDC doesn't have the funds to put on the mask, they just don't want a bunch of people in it to get vaccinated, so the whole thing is a scam."
52,3,"It's a joke. It's not a joke. I can't figure out what it is about, I don't know what it is."
58,3,Vaccination is a joke. It's a restraining order. It's a joke.
59,3,Vaccines aren't good because they're not safe.

94,3,"A game in the US. Who knows what might happen if a player can't get their nose out of the hive?

52,3,"The joke is about how a virus is a terrible disease, even if it is not infected?"
58,3,It's a joke - it's a restraining order. Vaccination is a joke.

94,3,No joke. Do not vaccinate yourself. Don't put your mask on if you don't have to. Do not bring it up to your boss.
