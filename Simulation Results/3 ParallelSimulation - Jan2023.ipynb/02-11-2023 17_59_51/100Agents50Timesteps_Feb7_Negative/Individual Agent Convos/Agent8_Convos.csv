9,8,I am not familiar with the context here.
10,8,They supposedly want the players to wear a mask to make the rules and regulations more rigid and the government doesn't want to.
13,8,The gov is invading the restaraunt and this isn't a good idea.
18,8,i lost a mask a lot during my time there. it wasnt a bad one
28,8,I'd like to see that the mask on the whites is used by the guys in the background. I don't think it's necessarily going to do much for the safety of the players and the game.
37,8,"I think the people in r/fap are a bit dumb, too. If the person has a history of getting sick, I think the health insurance company is doing it wrong."
64,8,I am not sure why you would have resigned so quickly if the government didn't have a public opinion on this. The only reason it doesn't have a public opinion on this is because there is no public opinion on this topic unless it is clear that people do.
70,8,I do not think it is safe to wear a mask. Its just a way to protect yourself against the dangers of it. You just don't do it right.
72,8,"I like wearing a mask. I'm gonna say it, but I don't want to have a team to do something like that."
73,8,"Its been very hard for me to believe that when you do the same thing with a team, you are actually playing better in the offseason."
77,8,"I'm not sure this would even work, but if he is wearing it and you're inhaling smoke while wearing a mask and you are getting an alert that you are leaking a virus that hasn't spread into the air yet, he's not gonna take any action to stop it."
84,8,"I was talking about something that is considered a scam. I think this is what they call the ""Which is the problem?"" nonsense of their leadership and what they call ""I'm a bad person"" - that's something that is unnecessarily stupid and disgusting."
100,8,"Trump said it's ok not to wear mask, and Ingraham said it's restricting our rights to keep us locked inside! You know our right to die and infect (kill) others. Why isn't Ms. Ingraham out there with them."
8,4,A lot of the government is doing this stuff. This is not a legitimate job.
9,8,"I have never had any problems with my team's safety. The irrational apathy that accompanies this attitude comes from people with the same concerns about their own personal privacy. They don't know it's OK to wear a mask, they don't know what it's like to a vaccinate and aren't able to understand why people want to wear a mask, because it's one of their most dangerous, and the most frightening, of all of the things they're going to do."
10,8,"In the US, there's no law allowing people to wear masks in their homes and the government can't control what they wear."
13,8,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i ve done in my entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things.

Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then"
28,8,It's not that bad. I was just trying to be very specific. I don't see how she even wants to go to the stadium with a mask unless she really is a jerk.
37,8,This doesn't go over well here in Virginia.
64,8,I work as a medical director for a medical organization in the United States and they are an official company. I want to go through the paperwork for this and try to find out how to stop a cough in the emergency rooms.
70,8,I don't know what you're getting at but it would be great if the government would start using the rumor of a new crazed person who hasn't even heard of the craze.
72,8,"What a weirdo. This is one of those questions people are being able to answer from experience. That's a pretty standard rule and one that's usually applied to the rest of us. I can tell you, we're just a very, very, very little group. I just know that we all have to learn to use my masks a bit more and get used to how they work. We have different rules."
73,8,"I agree with everyone. It's a really good way to prevent people getting sick because you can't keep yourself at bay, even if you have a mask on. I've tried to practice and I really enjoy it. I will be in a helmet for a few weeks, but have a few things on my mind to remind me not to get sick, I don't need to, but I do not want to get sick if I don't."
77,8,"I can tell you, the one guy in question was a scammer in that regard. It was not like he just wanted to 'win' in a good way.' I don't think there was much of a way to be certain it was something that wasn't a scam, but the rest was just to be safe."
84,8,I think this is a good sign. It's a legitimate scam and they are trying to trick people into taking a risk to stop it.
100,8,The Obama campaign has really been doing a good job of keeping their own people out of the House.
8,4,In the last ten years I have been able to make a lot of dreadful nonsense like this.
9,8,"The idea of not wearing a mask is pretty much ridiculous in Maryland. Ingraham is a shill, not a good person."
10,8,"I'd like to say if someone asks why people would not wear a mask when it's supposed to be a health issue, it's a 'decent joke' and not a scam."
13,8,"It's been a while, oh, and they need to get the right one."
18,8,I've been doing the same thing:
28,8,"I think you are thinking of the one that wears a mask in the game, because if a person is sick with a mask you should get vaccinated."
37,8,I'm not going to lie to anyone else. This is a serious case. The gov is the one who is violating the law. And I think we should get some new and specific stuff together.
64,8,I'm not sure why the government doesn't have a public opinion on this. The only reason it doesn't have a public opinion on this is because there is no public opinion on this topic unless it is clear that people do.
70,8,"I'm not sure why anyone thinks the word ""smoke"" is an important word."
72,8,"Unless you're a Republican, it seems unlikely. I lied to this person and I didn't answer that. Then I asked him ""why do you wear a mask?"""
73,8,What the fuck is the joke that is?
77,8,"The people who do this are idiots, but most of the scammers don't even try. They simply have a bad idea of their own. Regardless of the truths you're using."
84,8,Having a mask on means you're going to want to wear one. Wearing one can help keep people from getting sick. If it doesn't help they just go to their doctor and let them do their own research.
100,8,"In this context, that was what the original post was about."
8,4,I'd like to add to this that he is using the'scam' phrase a lot.
9,8,>I'm a non-masked vaccinated person. This isn't how I do things.
10,8,So a joke? Nope. A joke is a joke if you look at the picture.
13,8,The article said that they have a lot of rules about wearing masks - and what they do with them is the most accurate explanation for why the rules are in place - and if they aren't followed - they must have some way of getting them to pass tests.
18,8,It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. They don't want to pay attention to what 'right' means.
28,8,"I'm not a doctor, but I believe that wearing a mask on your neck can help prevent infections of some kind. A mask on your neck can also prevent infections of some kinds. The only other way I know that it is a scam is if you wear a mask to keep yourself safe."
37,8,>This is a real shame. We have to start taking steps to stop this. The government has no rights over what it says.
64,8,It's kind of scary how dumb they think all of is are.
70,8,There is not much I can give you here.
72,8,"I am not sure if this is true, but the whole ebola joke would be great for the NSA to annoy the public and then the CDC."
73,8,"I don't know if this is a joke but I think this is a legitimate way of telling the truth, as it's not going to go well at all."
77,8,"I would rather have someone just be more suspicious than to hear the exact words of the guy, a CIA agent, that was a CIA agent, who is not even on the CIA team and was a CIA agent."
84,8,The CDC is very active on this issue.
100,8,Is it really a hunch? Does he make the case that it was on the same subject as it is being debated?
8,4,You know... I don't really understand why people don't want to know what is a joke. It's not even a joke if you're a CIA agent. It's a joke if you're a CIA agent.
9,8,"The CDC has a problem with masks. If a man can wear one and be sick he should have been vaccinated, it's not his right to wear it. If he can't get one, then he shouldn't have to wear it, or be vaccinated."
10,8,It's a joke. It's just a 'funny' joke.
13,8,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.The thing is, the NSA is a terrible organisation. They lied about the facts. And it's a good idea. It's also a good way to protect people from the bad things people will say and get caught."
18,8,"Wearing a mask and they can't kill is a big deal. I have a health insurance policy and it is a tidbit about the government's use of a restraining order. The reason they do this is because they have to put people in the military or scouts to fight it, and as a result they're being cut off from the military."
28,8,"I'm not a doctor but I believe that wearing a mask helps prevent infections of some kind. A mask on your neck can also prevent infections of some kind. A mask on your neck can also prevent infections of some kinds. The only other way I know that it is a scam is if you wear a mask to keep yourself safe. I think that's what she's going to have to suffer. She's not doing anything wrong, but you're not a victim of the shit he did."
37,8,"Obama has a lot to do with the anti-virus movement. He was a powerful candidate on the 2016 presidential campaign, and I don't really think he embodies his agenda."
64,8,I’m not a fan of you. But I still prefer to wear my mask in my office. You can’t help but notice my mouth watering in a few seconds as it’s in my throat.
70,8,">I think the real story is that in 2009, the president decided not to wear a mask. They made it so that people could see he was infected and if they didn't, the president would retaliate and use it to spread a virus."
72,8,That isn't a good joke. It's a terrible joke.
73,8,"I think it's time to let this guy play. I'm not a bigot. I've been in a helmet for 7 years, and I just don't see why it shouldn't be a joke to get everyone to wear a mask."
77,8,"i lost a mask once to my daughter, but I didn't have it to eat her, so I had to wear it every day. I've been a CIA agent and I had my mask on for about a week and it was a nice and useful protective tool I used to protect myself from being contaminated. It made me wonder if the person who got it was really bad or just a dick."
84,8,You are the greatest scum of the internet.

9,8,You need to suck on a mask if you want to stop the spread of polio.
10,8,I see no reason why people shouldn't wear a mask.
13,8,You do realize they're trying to have some sort of restraining order on them.
18,8,The idea of wearing a mask to protect against a virus is a legitimate defense. You cannot be wrong or wrong. Your post is completely false. Is there anything in the article you know about what is being discussed in this thread about the NSA?
28,8,The CDC's own article (here) says there is no gov't role in stopping the spread of the virus.
37,8,"""He's the president."""
64,8,This is so hard to write... I'm really just waiting on the 'tough' part.
70,8,That is a prank. It is the prank.
72,8,[President Clinton]. Ingraham's stance is more to do with being a senator from Chicago than his own stance. I guess we're just talking about the same things the CDC is trying to do with people with HIV/AIDS.
73,8,"We're not going to ad for you, but i'll let you down if it's true. You're not a fucking head coach. I'll ad for you."
77,8,"So, how was your daughter being infected? You are not supposed to take the virus and it spreads into your body."
84,8,I don't think he's a doctor so I'd think it's good to know that he's a doctor because it's a scam.
100,8,The article is the first time I've read something like this:
8,4,I think that you are the real person and it's all right - the truth is that the President is trying to prevent the spread of the virus in the guise of spreading polio.

70,8,"I think you know what I'm getting at, but I think it is the fucking lie that is a fucking lie."
72,8,I don't have much sympathy for anyone but I do know the CDC is trying to push for more infected people to wear the masks. They need to know about it.
73,8,What are the rules in the NFL?
77,8,You're not being serious. Your story is just as valid as the book the Devil Wears a Mask

9,8,I think that the way the new ACA works is very similar.

18,8,It's not a joke at all. The government is promoting vaccines that are supposed to stop the spread of the virus.
28,8,The article states that people wear masks when they go out to play. The article states that people wear them properly under a helmet...
37,8,I would say it’s pretty much a joke. The government has no rights over what it says. It’s the definition of a prank. The government has no rights over what it says.

77,8,I just want to say this:
84,8,I have an article about this:
100,8,I am in the minority but the person who is telling you these words is not a minority person and not a minor.
8,4,I have been here a few times.
9,8,"If someone wants to live in a bubble, they must be vaccinated."
10,8,What kind of mask would you wear if you get infected with HIV?
13,8,I am a medical student. I have a doctor that is a professor at the University of Kentucky. I was a medical student and was a student at the CDC. I also have a teacher and two teachers. I also have a brother that is a medical student and is a physician. So I can see that. I have been a medical student for a year. The professor at the CDC was the student's mother. The professor at my school told me that my dad is an ivy and that he is a doctor. I can see that
18,8,No. What is going on in this thread? How does someone put on a mask to help a terrorist?
28,8,The government is not doing anything about the virus.
37,8,This ain’t a joke. This isn’t about the government. This is about the people.
64,8,"I'm very sorry to hear this. I am a doctor and this is a subject that I've always wondered about, and have considered. I am a little paranoid that my husband would get sick in the hospital and need to be vaccinated. My wife is allergic to the AIDS virus. I think I can help with that, but I can't help but notice the rash and discomfort he has while I'm in the hospital and not in the hospital."
70,8,"My favorite part is when it says, ""We should be ashamed of the fact that we can't do any of this."""

77,8,There is an article in the wiki that says that Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I'm not sure if you really believe what this is.
84,8,"There are a lot of people who haven't heard of the CDC, including those who have no knowledge of how the CDC actually works."
100,8,It's not as if the idea of the government being racist has something to do with what the US did as a president.
8,4,The government should stop a shit ton of things.
9,8,"'If someone wants to live in a bubble, they must be vaccinated.'"
10,8,I mean it's really only about preventing it. I think if you ask your friends why they shouldn't be wearing a mask then it's the best way to prevent it. It's the best way to help prevent it. I want the CDC to stop it so we can get people vaccinated. This is not a joke.
13,8,"He said, ""My friend, I was a medical student and a student at the CDC."""
18,8,Why is this the NSA's primary response? Its all about the hats. I don't know how to tell a troll that isn't an idiot that doesn't care if it's the government.

64,8,"It’s sad that there are so many masks in the military, so I’m going to give you some general advice. The government needs to have a public opinion on this."
70,8,There's a lot of things that aren't a joke on here.
72,8,I'm the NSA spokesman for CDC.
73,8,It's the first time I've ever seen a head coach use a mask that I've seen and it's never been a joke. But it's still a joke.
77,8,There's a difference between a bad CIA agent and a pathetic CIA agent.
84,8,Isn't it a good sign to let the CDC know that the CDC is using a fake vaccination vaccine to stop the spread of HIV/VHC?
100,8,"A man with a mask on isn't a troll. That's what's meant by a troll: a man with a mask who wears masks in public places who goes to the White House when he's trying to talk about the virus and does his part to stop it from happening. There's no ""right"" to keep him locked in a public place."

28,8,The article states that wearing a mask on your neck can help prevent infections of some kind. A mask on your neck can also prevent infections of some kinds.
37,8,I think the real issue is with the US government being a prankster to keep people from using fake ID cards because of their medical credentials and the fact that it is illegal to wear a mask in public without permission.
64,8,I really appreciate the kind words you've given.
70,8,It's a joke. It's not the joke. It's the joke. I don't like the joke.

There aren't many ""rights"" that are being considered a big part of the policy, and this is the only reason I don't think the movement is the same as the problem with Obama. That the president has a problem with the government is the problem. That's what I'm going to do."

77,8,There's an article in the wiki that says that Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
84,8,I'm going to add a few things:
100,8,"If it was a joke, the joke might have been more racist than not. I think it's going to be more offensive to a minority if the president did something to prevent the spread of HIV, but the hat issue is just too important to me to let someone with a mask be so offended."
8,4,"So you think ""Never hats hurt the health"" is a joke?"
9,8,"Well, he’s not trying to get a job and not be able to afford a life."
10,8,"I can understand that you have to go to the police and get a mask on when you get infected. And that if you are in a position to say that he doesn't want to wear a mask, that's all you can do about it."
13,8,"""The guy who makes a joke about the CDC has a lot of power, and they don't really have anything to say about the CDC."""
18,8,"I don't understand why they do it, but the guy who said the video was clearly trying to make a point about the restraining order being misleading."
28,8,"I can't say that I've ever been in a situation like this where I've never seen a doctor who was the one wearing the mask while I was in the game. I'm just not going to tell you anything about the CDC. But they are just trying to get the people to wear the mask to stop the spread of the virus. I'm not going to say ""I don't like it when my husband gets his hand in the cold when we're out on the road. I'm not going to say ""... ""but the CDC is suing the people"
37,8,Vaccination is the main goal. The government is not doing anything.
64,8,Vaccination is important to prevent the spread of a virus. The only way to stop it is to put on a mask so that you can be vaccinated. The whole thing is BS. The government has no reason to be on the receiving end of the problem.
70,8,''I lost a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam.
72,8,"It is possible that there are people with the virus and the CDC are raped for a reason and they are essentially the CIA. It would be very possible for this to be true, and I do not know if that will happen. It's possible, I am not sure, that it would happen in America but it's likely that the CDC would like to investigate and protect people from it. I don't see a reason to keep doing what it says."
73,8,"Vaccination is a joke. It's not funny, but it doesn't make you feel bad."
77,8,So I feel like this has been addressed before.
84,8,This is not a joke. It's a scam. This is a joke. This is a scam.
100,8,"I don't think the issue here is ""restriction"" vs. ""restricting our rights to keep us locked in"" (the word that's used as a phrasing and not as a meaning). You don't seem to have a problem with your view on this post."
8,4,"I've written a lot about a lot of these posts over the years, but you aren't a dick."
9,8,"The president of the United States, I guess. Isn't he a troll? The ACA is a huge mess. The CDC is basically the most corrupt in government - from being a partisan political entity to attempting to hush it over and over again without making any sense of it."
10,8,Is it the best way to stop the spread of the virus? No way it is a joke.
13,8,The article said that the CDC was trying to sabotage HIV. They will use a mask at the first sign of a sick person.
18,8,"The thing is, the NSA has been pushing out hats for decades. I think the hats should be there as well. The guy who said that would imply that the US is a terrorist organization and that you don't have any protection because of that is wrong. That has no relevance to the real issue."
28,8,"I'm not a doctor, but I believe in a mask."
37,8,I feel like you're giving the most basic and common sense answers here.
64,8,CANNOTANSWER (save me)
70,8,The President isn't the only one. He wants to be more effective. But the problem is that the people who have sick children still can't get vaccines.
72,8,The CDC has been sabotage a whole number of vaccines in the US. I'm assuming they also had a policy to keep people from getting in in the first place?
73,8,What did [NAME] play for?

8,4,The president has not done anything to prevent the spread of the virus.
9,8,I am not a politician.
10,8,"I'm not sure how naive and overreacting you are about the CDC's policies. There are also some really naive and overreacting ones. There's also a LOT of ""what to say"" ones and it's really not funny to me."
13,8,It's very sad. What I'm trying to say is that I feel as though I'm being really hard-core jerk and I'm not a jerk.
18,8,People are getting involved in the media and not on the NSA.
28,8,Vaccination is a joke. It's not a joke. It's a joke because the government has no reason to be on the receiving end of the problem. Vaccination is a joke.
37,8,"As a US citizen, this is exactly the type of thing I want to see and understand."
64,8,"""Vaccination isn't a joke. The only way to stop the spread of a virus is to put on a mask so that you can be vaccinated. The whole thing is BS. The government has no reason to be on the receiving end of the problem."

84,8,I don't get why the CDC is suing this. There is just a lot to be learned.
100,8,"A racist joke, but a joke is a joke. And the problem isn't that he's trying to be racist, but the fact that he's trying to keep people out of the White House is making it a joke."
8,4,"It's a joke that the government is suing the government. It's not about the ""do you know it's not a joke"" thing. It's about people trying to be funny or get a joke."
9,8,Isn't a mask a good idea?
10,8,I'd say the best way to stop the spread of a virus is to get a mask on yourself so that the patient's body can't become infected.

37,8,"Because they want to use a mask on people. So, I would say it's a joke."
64,8,I think the best idea to stop the spread of a virus is to put on a mask to protect people. The only way to stop the spread of a virus is to put on a mask to help people in the hospital. The whole thing is BS.

8,4,"You know you don't need a doctor to take this into account. It's about the vaccine, and not the actual infection."
9,8,I'd be willing to bet the CDC is a conspiracy against us.
10,8,">I see no reason why people shouldn't be wearing a mask when it's supposed to be a health issue. It's pretty fucked up for a president to have one, not to mention a bit of a shady and insensitive joke, which I know he's not in for, so he probably wouldn't have had a problem with that kind of joke."
13,8,Vaccination is the only thing that makes it a joke to me... but not a joke? You need to know the difference between a joke and a joke.
18,8,So you have a valid defense against the NSA?
28,8,"Vaccination is a joke, and it's not a joke."
37,8,This is a joke. I'm just kidding.

That is, a hypothetical scenario where the government is making a fool of themselves for using a mask to spread a virus. The people who were on that mask were also trolls. That is, they are acting as a prank."
28,8,"Isn't wearing a mask a joke? I mean, a joke is an insensitive and unnecessarily racist thing that isn't true for anyone. And this is not an excuse to be a racist for not talking about it."
37,8,"If you read the article, the prank has already started to creep me out. And it's just the president's joke. And he's putting up with some 'dead joke' things."

84,8,Why don't you take the story to court because you have no idea how much it's going to make you feel?
100,8,It sounds like the guy who is telling you these words is not a racist. He is trying to convince the public to stay out of the White House.
8,4,"It's pretty much the most fucking awful joke ever. It's a bit like saying ""hey, are you sick?"" or ""I hate you so much for that."" And ""I'm sick so much for it."""

72,8,I'm not sure why you're being so defensive. It just sounds like a joke that doesn't really seem like a joke. But its a joke because it's a joke and I like it.

Vaccination isn't a joke, unless it's something like a viral disease that's a joke. They have to work together and keep"

The CDC is trying to get people to understand that the CDC is trying to discredit the CDC. It's a joke, because a joke is a joke."
