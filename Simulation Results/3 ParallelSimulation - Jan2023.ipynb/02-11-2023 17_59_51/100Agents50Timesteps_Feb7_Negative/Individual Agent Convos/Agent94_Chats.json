    "Is the whole thing just a series of people thinking that's going to help me see what's going on?",
    "I don't think that's an accurate comparison. I don't believe that there is actually a full picture of what this whole whole thing is about, just the idea of using a mask is ridiculous, in my book the Devil Wears Masks, the movie tells the story of the evil guy wearing a mask while he's in it.",

    "The best way to prevent a virus is to do it. It's not enough to prevent a virus. The only thing that is more effective is that it has a full picture. If you're going to try to stop a virus and then not use it, you should stop using it. You don't need to spout one of the most effective ways to prevent it but rather use a mask that has a full picture, but is unable to detect a virus.",

    "It's more like saying if I read the book if I was sick i would probably die. I wouldn't get sick again if I didn't. But I can tell you that I've read the book. The book is about a virus that can cause pain in people's eyes",

    "I like the \"If\" part. It makes me feel that I'm at least partially comfortable in it. The idea is to look at the problem. I don't know what I'm talking about, but it feels good to be around people. I don't know what they're going to do to stop the virus from spreading, and it's going to be pretty tough to believe that a mask would be necessary to stop the spread. But I feel like I have no idea what that means. I don't know why they're trying to do it. I don't know how"
