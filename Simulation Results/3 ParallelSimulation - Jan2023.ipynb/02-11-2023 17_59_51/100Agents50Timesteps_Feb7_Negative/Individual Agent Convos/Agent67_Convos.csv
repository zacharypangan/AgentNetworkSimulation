80,67,i love coaching however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops
67,13,I know you're not a good coach. But it's pretty much like a rule at a club - no one wants to have to go through that.
67,20,OP: I think you are being a bit harsh.
67,37,"I love the way this game is supposed to work i think it's the best way to get in shape, and i really like the way the players are dressed to play it"
67,52,I'm not going to be the one to do this. The only thing that is going to stop me is that I will be in the office.
67,54,I will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops
67,60,This sounds to me like a shady dick move.
80,67,"I'm not that joking, but i don't care about the safety. I feel like my body looks like a shit. I get tired of wearing masks when i work and then they wear a lot of them to wear as the weather gets colder, because of the lack of wind. I'm a guy but I don't think i've ever seen the same thing happen. It makes my lungs hurt and my face hurt."
67,13,"So your team has been wearing masks since then, right?"
67,20,This sounds to me like a shady dick move.
67,37,"That's a lot of people who say ""I love the way this game is supposed to work i think it's the best way to get in shape, and i really like the way the players are dressed to play it"""
67,52,"> I love the way this game is supposed to work i think it's the best way to get in shape, and i really like the way the players are dressed to play it"
67,54,You are being harsh? Your coach is acting like a shithead and he is the only one who can even understand it.
67,60,"No, this sounds like a shady dick move."
80,67,[Browsing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
67,13,What if your coach is wearing a mask so they can breathe?
67,20,"I think I like the way you describe your personal life, and your personal life, but I like the way I talk about the safety of the team, and how I feel about the masks, and how I interact with players. I've said I don't care about the safety, but if I do, I'll have to leave to my team's team. It's the game."
67,37,"I don't know how your coach's shithead would say the same thing if your coach were to say it, but your guy doesn't know the difference between it being a shady dick move and you being a shady dick move."
67,52,> Your coach is acting like a shithead and he is the only one who can even understand it.
67,54,"I was talking about the shady behavior of your former coach who is also in the team. So what exactly is your point? I think you have a point and it should be understood. I've also heard that people who don't wear masks in school don't have to fuck with the coaching gang. It sounds like you think that your current coach has a lack of respect and a lack of self-control and a lack of trust. But you seem like you're being a bit harsh, and the fucking board is probably not even more so"
67,60,I can't stand you arguing with the guy.
80,67,There are a number of things that the government must do in order to stop the spread of a virus.
67,13,"I would be willing to bet you are a bad coach. If you genuinely want to quit, you aren't going to have to do that, and you have to be on the same page as every other student in your department and to have the same attitude towards the new players."
67,20,"The government is making a ton of money to stop the spread of a virus, and I'm surprised it's not helping. I'm just saying it's a good way to save money."
67,37,Are you going to tell your current manager that he is not interested in this game? Because he is not interested in this game. He is not going to know the difference. He isn't going to see the difference.
67,52,"This is a very serious issue. Why would he even want to talk about it? I'm not gonna go into detail about it, I'm not going to say anything about it. I'm not going to talk about it. I'm going to go into detail about it, but there are so many people that don't really understand it. This is a game."
67,54,"It sounds like the most important thing is putting yourself into an unfit position, and not deciding what to do to get into shape. The point is to put yourself in a position that you can enjoy in order to be a good player. You will never know if you are a good player on the field or not until you decide what to do."
67,60,This is why you have to resign before a government employee is allowed to do anything.
80,67,"""Weeding a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.'"
67,13,The first person to ask about this is not the first person. I was told that wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
67,20,"I'm also very impressed that some people haven't mentioned the actual virus yet (so I don't think I will do much for them, but I can see the difference)."
67,37,"He sounded a bit fucking naive, but the next time he says something shady like ""I love the way this game is supposed to work i think it's the best way to get in shape, and i really like the way the players are dressed to play it""..."
67,52,You know how to put yourself into the game? This is a serious issue. Why don't you just say it's a game?
67,54,"> 'I love the way this game is supposed to work i think it's the best way to get in shape, and i really like the way the players are dressed to play it'"
67,60,If he wanted to make a change at all I would be sure he would have a very clear message to his current manager.
80,67,"i'm not even sure i get it - i have some problems with the CDC, it is a joke. but i have an actual problem with the CDC, i hate it when people call me crazy and i'm trying to explain this. I just think its so silly to say what I'm saying if i had to say the same thing and have no clue"
67,13,"You're not being harsh. You are not talking about the government in a way that should be understood. Unless you were to agree to a compromise, or a compromise, that is not appropriate. And you are assuming that this is not the situation he's referring to. It's not as if he didn't make the right decision and he is trying to tarnish the situation by simply putting yourself in a position that they won't have to accept, which is what the government's doing. If you are willing to stand up for yourself"
67,20,"""Weeding a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

67,37,"What I think is interesting is that ""He was a shady coach and he is not interested in this game."" I think that if a teacher tells a student to go on a game with his teammates that ""I love the way this game is supposed to work i think it's the best way to get in shape"" and that he wears a mask, and then tells the players ""He likes the way the players are dressed to play it"", the manager's response is ""I will be a shady dick move."""
67,52,It's the most important thing for a coach to do: it's a 'game.'
67,54,> I've also heard that people who don't wear masks in school don't have to fuck with the coaching gang.
67,60,"""Weeding a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."""
80,67,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. I don't think it's illegal to have masks. I don't think it's illegal to have any kind of vaccine. Vaccination is a good way to prevent the spread of the virus.
67,13,"I think you're missing the point. ""He's a shady coach and he is not interested in this game."""
67,20,In the article they say that you're not going to make a change at all and your current boss isn't going to care if it's not a game. It's not the CDC shiting the park but rather the government in its use to do nothing.
67,37,Is the fact that you don't like wearing a mask a bad thing?
67,52,I've been told that the CDC and the Department of Defense are going to cooperate with CDC to protect the health of the public.
67,54,I'm going to go ahead and say that my own team is a different story. This is one of those stories.
67,60,">I'm not even sure i get it - i have some problems with the CDC, it is a joke. but i hate it when people call me crazy and i'm trying to explain this."
80,67,My family went to the CDC for some vaccinations. My parents were given a certificate of protection from all the diseases in the country.
67,13,"It's not the CDC, it's the CDC and the Department of Defense and the CDC does nothing to stop the spread of a virus."
67,20,"You're being a bit harsh. You're not even telling the truth. You're trying to play the game of the games, and you're trying to use your power to make them work and you're allowing them to run the game. They're not going to be able to play the game. They're just making money."
67,37,It's a joke. You don't like wearing a mask.
67,52,"CDC & CDC aren't trying to stop the spread of a virus, it's just trying to give them the opportunity to spread their vaccines. This does not happen when you're not being friendly or encouraging people."
67,54,"""He is a shady coach and he is not interested in this game."""
67,60,"I am sorry but if you do not like to wear a mask to play football, it is a bad thing."
80,67,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
67,13,I'm surprised there isn't a lot of people who wear masks because they believe that people don't want to come up with an excuse for not wearing them at the game.
67,20,"So I guess, for example, the player you're playing with doesn't have a virus, and that's why the team is playing, while the person playing on the field wears a mask, is not allowed to come into contact with the CDC, because if they're playing against a player who wears a mask, they don't get the chance to be a part of the team, or at least not be able to contact the CDC (which is the same as having the team play)."
67,37,"If this is a story, it's not about the school. It's about the football."
67,52,">I don't like wearing a mask. CDC & CDC aren't trying to stop the spread of a virus, it's just trying to give them the opportunity to spread their vaccines. This does not happen when you're not being friendly or encouraging people."
67,54,"Is your dad a prick? The government has no power, and I don't even think they have anything to do with it."
67,60,I don't know if it's just a joke or something but I'm not the only one. There are literally hundreds of examples of how the government works that are used for the purpose of preventing the spread of a virus.
80,67,"Vaccination is an important one. It isn't necessarily that way of talking about the vaccine. It's that it is being discussed because 'The CDC has a lot of business, not just a good job. If it's not an illegal, you need to talk to the CDC about the Vaccination Act. It has to do with the federal government."
67,13,"A new article by wikipedia says the CDC has no power, and it doesn't say anything about their actions."
67,20,"I want to say that I am going to be fine with wearing the mask, even though I don't know how to get out and yell at them about it."
67,37,A lot of schools have this shit-bag policy that can be used to deter the spread of a virus. A lot of schools suck it up. I think I'll just tell your boss.
67,52,"CDC and CDC are trying to protect the health of the public. You're being a bit harsh. You're being a bit harsh. You're trying to play the game of the games, and you're trying to use your power to make them work and you're allowing them to run the game."
67,54,"You can't even tell who is 'having a good time' when you're trying to tell someone who has no interest in it. It's basically ""not fair"" to everyone if a coach wears a mask."
67,60,I don't think it's funny that the article suggests that people who wear a mask are a bad thing.
80,67,"I am a medical professional. I'm an IT guy. I don't have a doctor, but I would try to work with people with disabilities, and a little bit of mental illness. I'd say that you're not crazy or crazy, but it's possible the medical professionals will have an easier time being a doctor if they don't have any aversion to their work environment."
67,13,"> I want to say that I am going to be fine with wearing the mask, even though I don't know how to get out and yell at them about it."
67,20,Vaccination is an important part of any job. I can't see them being a good idea.
67,37,>A lot of schools have this shit-bag policy that can be used to deter the spread of a virus.
67,52,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
67,54,I grew up wearing masks. It's my go-to when it comes to health. I love this sport and I'm so happy it's the best for my health.
67,60,It is not a joke. It is a joke.
80,67,I don't know why I'm saying something like that.

67,20,"I don't see how I'm being harsh. I know that they're trying to stop the spread of a virus, but I think they're trying to prevent it. But I'm trying to stop the spread of it because it's a good idea and a nice way to prevent spread."
67,37,"It is interesting how a couple of articles are about a ""shady"" behavior of a coach, e.g. : a coach is being a bit naive, but his response is that he isn't interested in this game because he doesn't like it."
67,52,I am a medical professional. I am an IT guy.
67,54,"People who don't wear masks in school have no control of their behavior, and the government has no power."
67,60,"I think you might be the only one who thinks that the federal government is allowing doctors to wear masks. This makes no sense to me. It's not really a joke. It's just one of those things that people who want to help other people with their health are trying to fix, and they're trying to make them work better."
80,67,"Vaccination is a good way to prevent the spread of a virus. It's basically a way to protect your own health."""
67,13,The article mentions a medical professional who is an IT guy. He has a lot of mental illness.
67,20,The federal government is attempting to prevent a disease.
67,37,"I'd say that if a coach tells a student to go on a game with his teammates that ""I love the way this game is supposed to work i think it's the best way to get in shape, and i really like the way the players are dressed to play it"". It's pretty much a joke, it's just a joke, it's just one of those things that people who want to help other people with their health are trying to fix, and they're trying to make them work better."
67,52,So you know... Why don't you just say it's a game? This is a serious issue. Why would he even want to talk about it?
67,54,You should feel bad for people who do not wear masks in school. The government has no power and their actions are nothing but a prick.

67,13,The CDC and Department of Defense have been trying to prevent the spread of a virus since 1983.

67,52,I don't think that the government actually wants the vaccines because the kids don't want the vaccines.
67,54,"So it's just a joke, that it's supposed to work, that the coach's behavior is not supposed to help anyone in the game, so that the coach has no reason to be a prick?"
