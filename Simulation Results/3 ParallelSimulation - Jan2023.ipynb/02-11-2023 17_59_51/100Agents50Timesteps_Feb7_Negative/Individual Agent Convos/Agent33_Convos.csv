84,33,So why isn't my mother wearing a mask a lot?
33,2,I have a copy of the text from Wikipedia. The problem is that it's a fake.
33,16,"Vaccination mandates for a person who doesn't wear a mask, or isn't vaccinated, are a felony."
33,22,"I think you are putting too much on ""wearing a mask"" by doing it without warning, and you are being sarcastic. It's kind of sad that you can't have any of these, and you don't have the right to say that your mom is the one who can't get a vaccine, but also that she isn't able to get a vaccine."

70,33,"I don't think I've ever seen a joke like that about wearing a mask and that I'm very happy about it. I'm really excited to see it on TV, but when it's true the truth reaches me!"
72,33,Is this in fact true? I’ve never seen a picture of a people being ripped off of a mask.

84,33,It's a scam. We've just had this happen a few times and we don't have any problems.

33,22,The government is not a fool. It is a scam.
33,31,It's a scam.
49,33,I don't understand why you're going to say this. I think what I'm doing is wrong. It seems like they don't know what to say and are just trying to convince the audience that something is wrong.
52,33,"I see it is a legitimate scam and I think it's one of the reasons they have been shady about it. I feel like it would make them even more suspicious, especially if you had a virus in your head, so they would have to be a little more vigilant."
58,33,It's not even an issue. I'm a RN and a current doctor if you have a question on the subject.
70,33,"I've had a few friends who were putting on a mask and I was getting really angry when I got them out of the way. I'm a little apprehensive as well, but I don't think it's the ""right"" thing to do. It's the ""right"" thing to do. The way it's being said is not necessarily the right thing to do."
72,33,I am not sure if I understand this correctly but this is actually the type of person that would be in the hivemind that would think I should have an ebola helmet.
79,33,"Trump was the one putting on the styrofoam for the last few years, when in fact, he had the same idea."
84,33,"Is the idea of wearing a mask because the person you aren't being a fraudster? Because you're not a scammer. This is a very common problem of the government. People will say things like ""I'm not being a scammer."" or ""I'm a scammer."" I've seen people say the same thing to me about ""I lost my mask when I was 14"". ""I'm a scammer"" but it sounds like everyone is."
33,2,I would be very sad to be a hivemind if someone were to ask me what I'd feel like I'd wear a mask when I was 14 and this was about my face getting infected when I was 18.
33,16,I think you're just being sarcastic about this...
33,22,I think the people with dm's were probably already working the scam in the past but I think the joke is now gone and you need to go to your parents - or go back and make a new one. I'm gonna go back to my parents so they can use my new masks to do what I do.

70,33,I like your style of joke - if you just don't know that we have to wear a mask you're going to want to hear that again.
72,33,Yes he does. And he was a Republican and a Democrat. And then he was the Republican candidate who is now the Democrat presidential candidate.
79,33,"The government is pulling the plug on the NSA, I know it's a joke, but in reality I think if he had that idea, he wouldn't be around a lot longer than the people pointing out the NSA is pulling the plug on the NSA slam. So if he doesn't think it's an interesting idea, I think he's getting too attached to a ""so what?"" prank."

70,33,The point is that we are not talking about an obvious infection. We're talking about a virus.

33,16,The CDC has no obligation to censor the sales of masks. I would argue that the government should have an obligation to provide it to the public because they know that people who haven't been vaccinated can become victims of it.

58,33,It is hard to think of any other president who is in the US unless one is willing to go into the military or an elitist.

58,33,"So he's been in the military for five years, then got into the military again?"

33,22,"In my opinion, it isn't a prank, it's a really fun one. I haven't seen a single poster mention wearing a mask as being part of the CDC's 'Mack' policy. Is there a way to see if they are interested in taking out a vaccinated person?"
33,31,"The CDC has a policy of not sending anyone to the military, unless there are legitimate issues in the US."
49,33,"This is one of those situations where you know people are genuinely being dicks and stealing from you. This is a prank. Vaccination is a step in the right direction. And I'm not trying to make you a racist nutter, but I'm not a racist."
52,33,And I'm not going to go to a prank a lot.
58,33,This is not a joke.
70,33,Isn't it a joke that the people who are using it are really scared that the CDC would become too stupid? Apparently the idea of wearing a mask isn't being used and that the people putting on it aren't being made aware of the virus. It's not a joke.
72,33,A lot of people are comparing Obama to Obama to get to know you and prevent the spread of your virus.

33,16,"I've seen it before, but it's not really fun. The CDC is using the masks as a way to get people to go to the doctor to have a vaccinated person get a vaccine. But even if they don't, they have to go, and they can't get rid of it. If they can't, they're doing the opposite. Vaccination is good and it's a prank. It's not a joke."

That's just a way to be critical of people and keep their jobs."
33,31,"It's pretty funny. My husband and I are trying to learn how to handle the virus - and he's not a smart person. He also wants to help people who have already been vaccinated (especially those with HIV). It's very, very much the most helpful thing the government has ever done. He also wants us to work on our vaccines, and give us an opportunity to show people that we are doing all kinds of great things that could save our lives if we didn't have to."
49,33,Is there any reason the president is going to stop putting on masks? I'm not a racist but I can see that there are a lot of racists out there who wouldn't be willing to pay to get vaccinated.
52,33,A prank is a joke and that's it.

It's pretty clear that there are people who are in danger of getting a health care situation and if someone wants to give them a health care facility, they will need a licensed doctor to do it. This is a good joke to be able to start with."

I feel bad that a lot of people get confused, they are being clingy and have a hard time explaining this to me.

79,33,This is a prank.
84,33,"I feel like if someone in this situation had the right idea that it was a scam and had the right idea and not put it in the context of a real traumatic event, it would be pretty clear that this is a scam."
33,2,"Yes, I do. The CDC has done a lot of damage to the public, not only to the masks, but also to the security at WTC. They have also relegated responsibility for the virus to government personnel and for the people exposing themselves to it."
33,16,I'm so sorry you're having a hard time explaining this to me.
33,22,Vaccination isn't a joke. It's a joke. Vaccination is a joke. It isn't a joke. Vaccines are a good idea to prevent the spread of a virus. It's not just a joke. It isn't a joke. It isn't a joke.
33,31,I haven't seen a virus in a million years but I've seen a few cases in my family that are highly resistant to vaccination. I've never seen anyone get a vaccine because I had the health insurance and the same vaccine.

33,22,The joke is not a joke because it has a purpose. It is a joke because it has a purpose.
33,31,I think the Obama administration has a lot of credibility issues with this and has shown that this isn't the place to stop vaccinating everyone. This is the place to show people that the Obama administration is putting a lot of pressure on the government to stop the spread of HIV and the Obama administration has a record of using a joke that is meant to be a joke.
