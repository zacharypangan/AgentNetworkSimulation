61,32,i just learned this yesterday in ny and i will be wearing a mask at twitchcon
70,32,"The government has not been trying to stop the spread of a virus by infecting the public and wearing a mask can be a scam, and is not the only person who has done this. Despite being anti-smoking, it is still considered antismoking and can only be used to stop the spread of a virus. Especially in the U.S."
71,32,"I don't even smoke a lot, and I do it by accident as well."
77,32,"YES! I lost a mask at least four times a day, but it only works if I'm not in the same room as the person who's wearing it."
79,32,"I love that you said that because you are right, but you will never know if you'll be able to say your mouth on the internet. It is very interesting how the idea of having a shield for your face and eyes is the same as in an ear-to-ear hearing mask."

32,4,"I am a smoker, but I love football and I like hockey, but I'm a guy who likes soccer and is a hockey fan"
32,18,I don't like wearing a mask. I'm not a fan of that.
32,23,I lose my masks on and off. I have a mask on and off and in the past I've always been against it. I've done nothing wrong. I've only been told what I have to do and what I need to do to get my mask to work.
32,26,"In my state I wear my head mask, if that's the case."
32,30,I think this is just a joke that was dropped at a game last week where a guy's wife is wearing a mask and the other guy has an illness. A lot of people think of it as a joke.
38,32,I think this is one of the dumbest things I've done in my entire life.
45,32,"Honestly, I didn't even notice what it said until this morning. I thought it was going to be a joke."
48,32,"Ingraham: We can't help anyone, and we don't do anything about it."
56,32,I'm going to start by asking what the CIA wants.
61,32,My aunt was diagnosed with a Virus. I went to the TWitchcon and got my first vaccinated. We went to the events at my grandmother's house. I couldn't get in or out of bed. I couldn't even see them because they were so loud. I wanted to be safe. I'm not going to take the job stymied unless I wear a mask. I don't want to be a sick squatter with the vaccinated vaccine I have.
70,32,"I feel like the word ""smoking"" has been used in numerous cases, such as when people were given a mask, that they were told not to wear it. That's all a scam."
71,32,My husband uses a mask for a few days on a regular basis because he has an allergy to a lot of drugs and they leak it all the time. It's not a bad idea to go outside if you can't even smell it in the air. He just smokes.
77,32,No it doesn't work. You're going to have to be in the same room as the person who's wearing it.
79,32,"I like to think that it's really a joke. I'm not really sure where they're going with this. If I were your friend, we might as well have a fucking chat or a ""do you know your skin color"" chat, or something."
85,32,"Especially if you can't afford to buy one, because there's a huge difference."

32,18,"A few days ago, a football coach told me his son was going to get vaccinated and I told him he wasn't allergic, I got a cough. And so I had to get on his back and ask him if he is allergic or not. We were told we should get the flu vaccine before he can go to the hospital. So he told him that he has no allergy to cough or cough and has an autoimmune disorder. His wife has a chronic asthma disorder, and they are doing a small, yet not nearly as aggressively apologised,"

38,32,>Why is Ms. Ingraham out there with them?
45,32,>The NFL will make it hard for the CDC to force players to wear helmets and helmets to protect them.
48,32,I'm not really sure if this is something that is actually on the side of a hunch or not. The article says that the government has created a program designed to prevent the spread of a virus.
56,32,[Cdc and TWitchCon both have a special Congressional committee meeting this week.]
61,32,"You have a lot of work to do. You don't have to go to the event, you have to work to get the job. You are in the wrong. You aren't doing the right thing."
70,32,People don't care to be a scam when it comes to things they've done. They want to do what they want without being a scam.
71,32,It's the same for me. I'm a smoker and it's not so bad that it's not a good thing.
77,32,"That's not a good thing, but the real thing is that you need to do the same thing. That's a bad thing."
79,32,Nope. Not a good time to play the game.
85,32,"I used a mask to break a tree but it was a great thing to use and work on. Usually it was a huge void where the tree was hanging, and I had to reapply and wipe it down on the floor to get it back. I didn't want to be the one slamming it open, but this got me into it and made my face dark and I ended up getting a broken nose. The slammed my eyes out, and smacked my mouth open. I couldn't believe that I had that reapp"
94,32,"I'm trying to be blunt, but I can't think of a way to say it. It's really dumb of the government to do that. I don't think that's the best thing for the NFL, and it isn't to be."
32,4,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.No it doesn't work. You're going to have to be in the same room as the person who's wearing it. I like to think that it's really a joke. I'm not really sure where they're going with this. If I were your friend, we might as well have a fucking chat or a ""do you know your skin color"" chat, or something."
32,18,"You don't like wearing a mask and you don't want to be a good player. But at least you're not getting an unlucky one. I would rather be a decent player, and avoid a game and not play the game, because I have an extremely healthy lifestyle."
32,23,"So my father did a similar thing to his son. He reapplied to get vaccinated for flu or something similar, he was getting infected. He was not a fan of it. He used to be a very strict guy, and was a total jerk. He didn't take a lot of vaccination or anything because the kids were all allergic to a lot of things. He was only told to get the flu vaccine before he could play football, and it wouldn't work, so he didn't wear a mask."
32,26,"I would love for the CDC to put in place the programs to prevent any type of polio outbreak. I don't know much about the medical field, but they seem like the most credible sources on this."
32,30,People don't care to be a scam when it comes to things they've done. They want to do what they want without being a scam.
38,32,"You mean the guy who wrote ""Little blue ones are totally useless."" Then why don't you go read the entire Wikipedia article and read the entire article for yourself."
45,32,>The NFL will make it hard for the CDC to force players to wear helmets and helmets to protect them.
48,32,"The thing is, I think it's time to give the new administration some time to develop a better way to deal with this problem. We need to start promoting vaccines to the players because they seem to be not good enough to deal with the virus themselves."
56,32,I’m a big fan of the anti-vaccine nonsense of it.
61,32,"I'm not a doctor, I'm just trying to evade the fact that this is a meme of someone who is being indoctrinated with a virus. Vaccination is what prevents people from getting sick from a virus that can be spread all over the world."
70,32,"They should always have someone wearing a mask to protect them from the viruses causing them to spread, it's a shame, because it is completely useless to any government agency."
71,32,I'm not sure what they are doing. The government is doing this.
77,32,I was in high school when my dad would wear his mask to school. After that he said he didn't want to get in the way of the victim of the infection. We just wore them and we couldn't get back out of the way.
79,32,"No, it's not a good time to play the game."
85,32,"... and now, after reading his book, you're thinking: 'I'm so sorry."
94,32,"It's the best thing to ever happen to the NFL, and it doesn't have to be."
32,4,> I like to think that it's really a joke. I like to think that it's really a joke. I'm not really sure where they're going with this.
32,18,>The NFL will make it hard for the CDC to force players to wear helmets and helmets to protect them.
32,23,I don't have a problem with that. I want a joke and a vaccination to go with it. But it isn't a joke and I don't need to be at all a good player to see it worked.
32,26,You should read it again. This guy's a doctor. I believe it.
32,30,"People like to put themselves out of public eye and get away with it, because they want to do the best thing possible."
38,32,>You are very good with children.
45,32,"Vaccination is a big part of the game, especially when you have a cd. They are also very sensitive to infections from certain vaccines. In addition, if the players are wearing masks, they can get a bacterial infection. That's one of the major reasons people do not wear masks."
48,32,We should have a new mask as a part of our national vaccine program.
56,32,"Vaccination is illegal. It's the only cure. We do this for people, not for those who are vaccinated."
61,32,"I know that, but I don't know if this is actually a meme or if it's really not a meme, but I think this is a little silly."
70,32,It sounds like the president has a problem with how people are treating people.
71,32,>You're a scam. You're a scam. I like the way you think. I'm gonna get a real mask for this. I like the way you think. I'm very sorry. I'm getting to the end of my speech and then I go and I do it a lot! I do it a lot! I don't know if it would work for so long as I was a smoker. I'm very sorry. I'm getting to the end of my speech and then I go and I do it a little fun.
77,32,"I would wear a mask every day, especially in the case of an infection. But I'd get my hands on them all day long."
79,32,"The guy who is pointing out that the NSA is pulling the plug has a right to say, ""I think that's a joke."""
85,32,This guy sounds so silly as to have to think about it.
94,32,"Why would you want to be a head coach. The thing is, you have to know the rules. If the government wants to do that, then you are in for a rip-off, unless you have a contract that is not written down. You're allowed to do this without an attorney and you are allowed to do it without a contract."
32,4,The NSA is pulling the plug on vaccines. The national health department has the power to make these rules.
32,18,"I think it's a bit silly, but it's kind of funny, because I mean, it's a joke."
32,23,This seems like a legitimate question.
32,26,I think the whole point is that the NSA is pulling the plug and not the players.
32,30,"In some states, the government isn't required to do anything. The NSA has a right to not do something illegal, which is not an illegal way to do it."
38,32,CANNOTANSWER: The CDC and the US government are promoting vaccines that are supposed to stop the spread of the virus (Vaccines).
45,32,I mean the CDC wants you to wear a mask. They are trying to'swim it' at the team but there is a problem in the US.
48,32,">But I think if you really think the government is a good candidate to get that away with, let's just look at the fact that they're not a good candidate."
56,32,Are you referring to what I'm trying to say. I'm a HUGE fan of the anti-vaccine nonsense of it.
61,32,It doesn't seem like a meme in any way.
70,32,The problem is that people cannot be completely silent - their entire body is already infected.
71,32,"I think this is a good thing for you. OP, it is not a scam."
77,32,"It's a scam. It's more like ""I lost a mask at least four times a day, but it only works if I'm not in the same room as the person who's wearing it."""
79,32,It is a joke. Isn't it safe to not wear a mask? Because it's the only way to protect you from infections. It's a fucking joke that a few people are still sneezing at when they rant about the health care slam on Trump.
85,32,I think this guy sounds like a jerk. It's definitely one of the best books I've ever read and I recommend it.
94,32,"""... the only way to stop the spread of a virus. Please wear masks."
32,4,"""You can't be completely silent if you're not in the same room as the person who's wearing it. """
32,18,This makes me want to think about the people who work for the CDC and the NFL.
32,23,Aren't you a fan of the CDC and the US government?
32,26,I think it's funny that a guy who is an advocate for vaccines has no business being an asshole about his government policy and his lack of education in this field.
32,30,"It's a joke, it isn't. I'm not saying it's a good thing, it's just that the public doesn't care about them and the government."
38,32,This is not a joke.
45,32,>I think the people who are putting on the mask need to be vaccinated as they don't know what it means.
48,32,"IANAL, but I am a doctor and a coach in the NFL."
56,32,It's all one part of a bigger problem.
61,32,This has nothing to do with a virus. You can't just put up with people who aren't vaccinated.
70,32,So how is the person who's a good athlete wearing a mask?
71,32,It's a scam.
77,32,I'm just a young person with a very bad brain. A lot of people do not have a good brain.
79,32,I'd rather have a mask than have a mask and not get vaccinated. I wouldn't want to be a doctor.
85,32,I love the book. I just can't get it in print.
94,32,"[i'm not a hockey fan so I'm not much of a football fan. I really enjoy coaching."""
32,4,I think the NSA is pulling the plug on vaccines. The national health department has the power to make these rules.'
32,18,I don't like the idea of playing football unless you want to. But what about a hockey player? That's what I mean.
32,23,I feel that's just what we have here in the sub.
32,26,"This book is a good read. It's written by one of the best people in history who has been in the NFL. It is one of the best, and most controversial books in history."
32,30,"That book is so good. I'm a football fan, but a doctor. The problem is, it's so silly."
38,32,I know this is one of the weirdest things I've done in my entire life. But I'm sure the people who do it like a jerk are a little sick or have HIV/AIDS...

61,32,"I’ve got a very long history of seeing that meme on every FB page. The best memes for people to know are ones that are used for what they want to know. My mom and her daughter have been through this exact situation and it was a great time. It seems like there were other people out there who were so open about it and knew how it was going to come out in the first place, which is why people are so scared of being surrounded by it. The first time I heard of this, I was in the middle of a cliche. It was an example of the"
70,32,The CDC is not the president of this country and in fact he is the one trying to discredit a public health program he is trying to sabotage.
71,32,"I'm really sorry, I am not the only one, my husband is using a mask because he has an allergy to drugs, he does not use one."
77,32,"If the person who lost a mask is a CIA agent, and they do not wear one, they should just be wearing one, or do something different with the other person. They're also going to need to be careful not to use a mask for people without permission. It's a huge scam that they should just not have to carry out any of those actions."
79,32,That's a joke! The man is a dick.
85,32,"I would read his book in a book, though. The first chapter was about a guy who was beaten with a mask and used a cigarette lighter."
94,32,"Vaccination is terrible. If the team is vaccinated, a player can not be infected. If they are not vaccinated, you will have to wear a mask."
32,4,"I don't like to talk about what he says and just want to be honest. But for the record, I've never seen a CDC article about a CDC report that said ""Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.No it doesn't work. You're going to have to be in the same room as the person who's wearing it."" I'm not a big fan of the idea of football but I am a great coach. I'm not a great coach."
32,18,Is the person in your family a good person? I know the CDC has been able to get away with this for a very long time.
32,23,The CDC has a very good record for implementing such legislation. In fact they're trying to prevent people from being able to make a decision without a medical license. The CDC is not the one trying to discredit public health programs.
32,26,"Vaccination is terrible. If the team is vaccinated, a player can not be infected. If they are not vaccinated, you will have to wear a mask."
32,30,"I know a lot of people are skeptical about it, but the first one is very well written and well written. I will tell you about it."
38,32,It seems like the whole point of my post is to get your life out of that state and get out of that situation as quickly as possible. That's the whole point of my post.
45,32,What do you think about the players being allowed to wear the mask in the first place?
48,32,It's a joke and it's a scam. It's a scam because it's not true.
56,32,Vaccination is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.What a joke. Then you have to find a solution to this. I’m going to start by asking what the CIA wants. ‘‘I’m a big fan of the anti-vaccine nonsense of it.
61,32,"I think this is a pathetic joke. If you have an open mouth, then he could just say he can't get in his car or have a cigarette in his pocket, and get a cigarette out."
70,32,"I know you know this, but there are actually a few good things that can happen."
71,32,I see the joke of a man wearing a mask for a few days in the office every day for no reason.

85,32,"I’m going to give a review of this book to people who don’t have a book to read. It has a lot of interesting facts. The whole thing reminds me of when I read the book in my head, and a lot of times I think people are trying to read the whole thing."
94,32,"I don't think there's anything wrong with wearing a mask or getting vaccinated. Vaccination is terrible. Vaccination is a terrible disease. If the team is vaccinated, a player can not be infected. If they aren't vaccinated, you will have to wear a mask."
32,4,"This isn't just a joke, this is a situation where people think they can be a good person and you can go about life. If you want to be a good person and a good person and you're going to get off this game and just threw on a team, it's important to get off it first. It's not a joke. It's a way to help get you off of the field but don't let them get you off."
32,18,Is the person in your family a good person? I know the CDC has been able to get away with this for a very long time. The CDC has a very good record for implementing such legislation.
32,23,I grew up in the US. A friend of mine in the USA went into work for me when he was in his 50's. A friend of mine had a baby and a father lived in an elderly family living in the city. He was able to see that his kids got flu like his parents had told him.

45,32,"It's the only solution in our current system. They want to keep all the other players safe. It seems like there's no way that they could get the vaccine they need. And yes, it's a joke."

56,32,"I cried when a physician asked why I didn't wear a mask, and this made me so angry."

32,18,My favorite way to say it:
32,23,"The only way you get your vaccinated is to buy a new one a few months ago, and you will have to go to the store to buy a new one."
32,26,The best part is the CDC is also pulling the plug on vaccines. I do love a good book about it. The guy is a prankster.
32,30,"I feel like the joke is that people are talking about the vaccines, they just don't know what they are talking about."
38,32,"I'd love to see what this guy's answer was, but in the context of the article, it seemed ambiguous. It is probably an attempt to avoid a lot of discussion. It sounds like he just was trying to justify a position he thought was stupid. But to be able to address it with a reasonable response is a ridiculous statement. I'm just saying it isn't about the CDC but the whole nonsense and nonsense they're trying to portray it in."
45,32,The issue is that people are stupid. Not if the sexes themselves are not vaccinated.
48,32,"He doesn't seem to care about the health of the public. He is trying to take advantage of people like you and the people he has worked with and who have a good knowledge of all the things he did. It's just the government. It seems like the government has little incentive to try to bolster their control over people. I'm not sure if that's a good idea, but there is no way the government could stop a virus from spreading."
56,32,I'm a huge fan of the anti-vaccine nonsense. It's all one part of a bigger problem.
61,32,"No. It's not a joke. It's a very common misconception. It's a joke, a joke and a joke."
70,32,"> I've been wearing masks in public for about 6 months now. I feel like this is a joke. The problem with a mask is that people are sick and have an infection of some kind, not what's actually being used to fight off the virus. I think it is kind of ridiculous for people to wear masks to fend off their illnesses in order to stop a virus. I think it is kind of ridiculous for people to wear masks to fend off their illnesses in order to stop a virus."
71,32,"I can see how you can't do that. Just put your face on a mask. If you can't breathe or it is still there, just go out and smoke."
77,32,"In the real world, the best solution for a virus is to just take care of the symptoms."
79,32,> Afaik is a prank. Vaccines.
85,32,"It is interesting to note that these comments don't have any actual context, because I've primarily been reading them in context. I'm looking at them in context, as someone who has done a lot of reading, and is probably not aware of the details. I'm not sure about how much of it has anything to do with what Tim Curry is saying, but it's certainly not something I'd say in the context of this thread."
94,32,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

32,23,"The one thing that people can't understand about the CDC is their ability to censor what they're educating people about. There's a lot of ad hominem, but it's a lot better to have a few people to go get one. Having a group of people tell people that they are going to be vaccinated would be like telling a lot of fucks how it's the best thing to ever happen to the country."

38,32,He's a medical doctor. He doesn't see the issue as being serious. I'd like to see that a doctor could get some help but not make the situation worse.
45,32,Vaccination is a big part of the game.
48,32,It's a very good one. I'm a doctor and I can read. This guy just seems like the type of guy that would use it to prevent AIDS.
56,32,"I'm gonna go back and look at a video that has a CDC quote, ""We do this for people, not for those who are vaccinated."""
61,32,"I think if someone has a virus, then a mask is a joke."
70,32,a lot of racists are going to want to stay outside of the White House to prevent people from getting those viruses.
71,32,"I'm not sure what's going on here, but what is happening is that you can actually get vaccinated, or be vaccinated without a mask, and have a mask instead. Vaccination is terrible, but it's a real thing."
77,32,I lost a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam.
79,32,There is a bunch of people who believe that vaccines are being used to prevent the spread of virus.
85,32,People will make a lot of mistakes as a result of what they see as an opportunity to sell the book.
94,32,"My friends used to do this all the time in my high school, but they were very careful. It was a huge waste of time, but when I was in college, I was getting the first and second chance to go to the ER. I'm a doctor and so was my girlfriend, but never got the first chance to go to the ER. I was still vaccinated after my first game of college, so they took away my helmet. I'm pretty sure that's not how the virus was spread."
32,4,"Vaccination is terrible, but it's a real thing."
32,18,"I'm sorry, but in my mind I think this is the ad hominem."
32,23,I'm pretty sure you are right - this whole thread is a bunch of crazily sexist pranks and racist shit.
32,26,"They want you to have a ""vaccinated"" mask. You have a good one."

45,32,The article is also about wearing a mask to stop the spread of a virus. The article doesn't mention the CDC. The fact that you have a medical exemption for someone who is a fraudster is a joke.
48,32,I'm very confused as to why the CIA and NSA aren't attempting to stop this.
56,32,"My apnea nurse said she has never seen a doctor for a while, so I'm not sure if it's the same."
61,32,"I've heard about it before and it's really interesting that some of the more racist ones like this are here, but it's more of a joke. I'd say the people who care for the virus need to see their doctor and see what they can do about it. But when they see these jokes they're mostly about not being vaccinated. I don't think it's a joke. I don't know much about it. It's just a joke. It's about a joke, but not a joke."
70,32,"This isn't a joke, this is a problem. That's why we put it in public TV."
71,32,The joke that was just made for a joke is still valid in my opinion. I mean...
77,32,The people who aren't in the US know nothing about the virus. That is part of a conspiracy.
79,32,'Afaik' is a joke.
85,32,"“People are not fools, they're people that are just assholes based on information they have to offer."

32,23,"The most racist thing that I can think of is ""oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that"""
32,26,I like the idea of people sharing their stories to make a joke. There is no way in hell I would put up with it if my friend or I were the only one who made a joke about vaccines and they thought it was a joke.
32,30,"Why? The CDC isn't required to do anything, the NSA has a right to not do anything."
38,32,The article is a prank.
45,32,">What do you think about the players being allowed to wear the mask in the first place?', ""I mean the CDC wants you to wear a mask.

They are trying to'swim it' at the team but there is a problem in the US."", ""I mean the CDC wants you to wear a mask. They are trying to'swiming it,"""
48,32,It's a joke. The US government is not supposed to stop the spread of a virus.
56,32,"We're going to have to get a sexy, mask a mask, and then getting vaccinated. If you can afford it, the better the chance of the virus spreading to you and your team."
61,32,"You sound like you're the one who is making the best joke ever, but it seems to me that this is the beginning of a trend. You are fucking in a shithole."
70,32,"...[That's a joke, a joke]."
71,32,"Yeah, it's kind of a joke. Vaccination is a terrible disease, if you don't have a mask then your lungs aren't ready for it anymore. It's a joke."
77,32,People who don't know the whole story are in the wrong.
79,32,I'm assuming the CDC is being more serious than the CIA is?
85,32,You fucking fucked up.
94,32,"I'm a coach. And I love going to the field, but I'm not sure what they should do. I'm not sure what is so wrong."
32,4,"As a student, I'd love to have a sex conversation with people like this. Just to let them know I can't do anything, not to get hurt in the process, or do anything about it. I would not want to be in the same room as the person wearing a mask. I would make fun of the players and they'd be rude or mean."
32,18,Aaaaand I don't want to be one of them because I am. I'm not a fan of the game either and I've seen all the kids who like football - and if that's a good sign - I don't think I want to be involved at all.
32,23,Vaccination is terrible. Unless you don't have a mask on and are allergic to that virus.
32,26,I think the most racist thing is that a guy who is an advocate for vaccines has no business being an asshole about his government policy and his lack of education in this field.
32,30,"This is what we do in our era, not because it's a joke but because it is a joke."
38,32,>I don't think the CDC is a prankster.

48,32,Vaccines are an illegal means of vaccination. It is not illegal to have them.
56,32,"A lot of people get vaccinated, but it isn't a vaccine."
61,32,"I don't understand the term ""comedy"" and the fact that Vaccination is a joke is ridiculous."
70,32,CANNOTANSWER: It's an incredibly interesting idea. The president decided not to wear a mask because he felt they were a way of getting people to be aware of the disease. But then he decided to wear one because the virus spreads. I think it is kind of ridiculous for people to wear a mask to fend off their illnesses in order to stop a virus. The President said it's the President of the United States and didn't get much publicity for it. It's an incredibly interesting idea.
71,32,"Vaccination is a terrible disease. Vaccination is not a joke. The government doesn't need to know, because there's no real solution to that problem."
77,32,"I have no idea what they are talking about, but I'm actually pretty sure it's a scam. It's like saying I've been lied to by the CIA, and the CDC."
79,32,Vaccination is actually an option for people who need to get vaccinated. But it's not a way to prevent the spread of a virus. It's a way to protect yourself from spreading a virus. The problem is vaccinations. The problem is vaccines.
85,32,You don't know what you're talking about.
94,32,"You're probably thinking of the wiki article which was about it. Originally it was a joke, and now the headline is misleading. The wiki article itself was actually just a piece of information that was taken from the article by a researcher."

32,23,I can't even begin to express how much I dislike wearing a mask and how I don't get to wear one.

70,32,"It's funny, if the person that told it to him that he would wear it could have something to do with it."
71,32,"It's a joke, you're not the only one. It's a joke, and it's one of the biggest problems the government will face in order to keep the people who get vaccinated from getting sick."
77,32,"Unless the author is an actual doctor, I wouldn't take it."
79,32,The CIA is the only authority to keep people safe. They can use that mask to get people infected if they want to. But it's not a way to prevent the spread of a virus.
85,32,"I was on a mission to get the government to stop the spread of the virus. I was in a situation where I was in a very specific position and the person being raped and who had to read the book without a mask was the person in charge of trying to protect themselves. I just think that that's a pretty crazy, and cynical, and horrible thing to think about."
94,32,"Vaccination is a terrible disease. If a player is not vaccinated, a player can not be infected. If they aren't vaccinated, you will have to wear a mask."
32,4,"As a former CIA officer who worked with the US NSA during WW II and was a big fan of the virus, I cannot see why the CDC is going to let them use a mask as a means to prevent them."

32,23,The first part of the article mentions an article about the CIA's work on vaccinations.
32,26,It's the only way to stop the spread of a virus.
32,30,I don't understand how that can be a joke. I feel that a fake joke is better than fake jokes.

71,32,"Vaccination is not a joke, it's a joke. Vaccination isn't a joke. It's a joke."
77,32,"The movie isn't about the masks. It's about the one where the doctor who makes the masks isn't the one who makes the mask. The movie talks about how the CIA has spread the virus. What they did to stop the spread is an excellent example of this scam. The guy who lost the mask is an an expert in the anti virus world, and that doesn't make him a racist. It's a really bad idea for people."

32,18,That's a really good idea.
32,23,"Well, as a guy who worked for the CIA, I can attest that this is an excellent post and a very good example of the jokes and conspiracy theories in the CDC. The CDC has a very good record for implementing such legislation. They are trying to prevent the spread of a virus. If the president wanted to have an airborne virus, he wouldn't have the money to make a joke about it."
32,26,What about a player having to wear a mask for a period of time and then having it wiped away from her for a few days?
32,30,It sounds like an excellent article.

94,32,It’s actually a joke. It’s not a joke because it’s actually a joke. Is there a joke about the government being able to protect against a virus if the government has no idea what it’s talking about?
32,4,I think you are being petty and sexist.
32,18,"I’m also not a big fan of hockey. I’m a hockey fan. I’ve been playing in a hockey game and have never been hit with an AIDS virus or something like that. I love it, but I’m also really a bit of a football fan."
32,23,"Well the CDC, the NSA and other countries, like many others do, are not in the best position to discredit the CDC and the CDC is trying to discredit public health. But if they are doing an anti-virus campaign, then they don't have the money to do so. They don't have the money to do so, because they have a very strong reputation with the public and the military."
32,26,"As a doctor, I can say with absolute certainty that there is a problem with vaccinating people, and that is what I believe to be the best way to prevent polio."
32,30,The entire point of Vaccination is that it is the only and most legitimate way to prevent the spread of AIDS. The CDC is not mandated by the Constitution. The government is not allowed to take any steps to prevent this from occurring.
38,32,This is a joke because I am not the guy who wrote 'Little blue ones are totally useless.''
45,32,Vaccination is a big part of the game. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
48,32,"It's like if the president can't get the CDC to stop, and that's why they're trying to start a government campaign against the government."

79,32,"I like to think that it’s really a joke. It’s really funny because it’s an unintended idiom. It’s like saying “I just can’t put my foot down that is a joke.” But, it’s a joke because it’s about the government."
85,32,"I know I need to put it on a list, because of the lack of context. I don't even know what to say. I just think that the whole thing is a mish-mash."
94,32,Yes. That's the joke I would make about the vaccine.

48,32,The article cites some of the jokes in the article.
56,32,Vaccination is not the joke. It's the vaccine that was chosen by the US government.
61,32,"Is the CDC not using the word ""comedy"" in any way?"
70,32,Why does the president not wear masks in public for 6 months?
71,32,It is a joke to make fun of the CDC.
77,32,A good way to deal with this.
79,32,You’ve been playing a game for years and you’re not sure what is going on. You’ve been playing a game for years. You don’t know what’s going on.
85,32,What was the point of the movie?
94,32,"The joke isn't about vaccines. It's about vaccination. The government is trying to prevent it by using it as a joke. The CDC isn't involved with the vaccines. The CDC doesn't have any sort of role whatsoever in preventing it. It's just a joke. A joke is a joke, as in a joke, but it's a joke."
32,4,"Yes, I get what you are saying. The truth is it isn't a joke, it is an act of cruelty. The government is using it as a means to prevent the spread of a virus. I do get why people say it, but its a joke."

32,30,I'm a doctor and I'm always looking for good reasons to be with the government in that situation.
38,32,I don't know if the CDC is suing you for it or not. I'm trying to figure out what kind of joke it is. It is not a joke.
45,32,The article states that the CDC is doing the best they can to prevent the spread of a virus.
48,32,That is a fucking crock.
56,32,Vaccination is the vaccine that was chosen by the US government.
61,32,"Vaccination is a joke that is not a joke. It is a joke because it is a joke. The word joke is used to make jokes. The CDC is using it in an attempt to make a joke. They are trying to make a joke, but it is a joke."
70,32,It's a joke. It's a joke that's made fun of because it's not a joke.
71,32,There are a lot of great jokes that are trying to make a joke.
77,32,"""If I lose a mask at least four times a day, but it only works if I'm not in the same room as the person who's wearing it."""
79,32,The CIA is the only authority to keep people safe. They can use that mask to get people infected if they want to.
85,32,"The guy in the book explains that his book is ""The Devil Wears a Mask."""

32,4,"I don't know what the word joke is, but the joke is an attempt to stop the spread of the virus."
32,18,You're so apathetic.
32,23,"Yes. They do have a good reputation with the people in charge of this. They don't have a problem with anything. They're trying to discourage people from wearing a mask. Vaccination is a joke, it's a joke, but they are trying to discredit them. They are trying to discredit things in the past with the promise of having public health care in mind."
32,26,The point of a joke is to tell people that the guy is lying and is using his job to nip people off.
32,30,A CDC CDC report - 'It's just a joke.
38,32,"Vaccination is an essential part of the healthcare system. The government has a history of causing the spread of the virus. “As in, the CDC is doing all the shit to bring down his ol' doctor because it's exactly what it is.” (As in, the CIA agent that wears them. Vaccines are not allowed under federal regulations. Because I don't think that is a joke."
45,32,"You’re right. The CDC isn’t attempting to sabotage the US’s vaccination program, which is why it’s called a 'joke'."
48,32,The CDC and CDC should not be suing the CDC. It's basically trying to stop a virus from spreading.
56,32,The only reason he hasn't seen a doctor is because of his fear of being shamped by the government.
61,32,"I'm trying to tell you: ""Don't be that guy, I'm trying to tell you to be the guy who's gonna be that guy."""
70,32,"Yes. I get the joke, but it is just one joke. The CDC has been doing it for so long that it's not going to stop the spread."
71,32,"I don't think this is the joke. I've always thought it was about the government. So, what's the joke about the government? Is the CDC just trying to help the CDC keep the virus from spreading?"
77,32,"I don't know what I think he's implying but in a post about the government you said the ""advice"" movie was going to be about a person who lost a mask. So he's talking about how the CDC does it, and is talking about how he is trying to stop a virus from spreading."
79,32,"It's a joke because it's a joke, because it's a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke."
85,32,The authors are trying to make the movie about him. They are trying to get the government to subsidize him. So they are trying to get the people to do the things he says to him. The film has all the important information and some nice gifs.
94,32,My favorite sport of all time is football. I would wear a mask and wear a helmet.
32,4,"In this case, the joke was about the government getting rid of vaccines. They do not want people to do that, they are going to stop the spread of the virus. This isn't just a joke, but a way to be a joke. They are trying to do it to discourage the people to do it, causing the problem."
32,18,"The joke doesn't mean it's about the government. It's about putting people off having sex, which would be a joke if a guy had just gotten a cough?"
32,23,"""The devil wears a mask. Is it good or bad?"""
32,26,That's a joke.
32,30,Vaccination is the best thing that ever happened to a team. There's nothing wrong with being vaccinated. People aren't afraid to be sick. They are sick and sick.
38,32,CANNOTANSWER: It sounds like he just was trying to justify a position he thought was stupid. But to be able to address it with a reasonable response is a ridiculous statement.
45,32,"A joke is a joke. If the article was nagging ""Morbid I don't wear it"" the CDC would have made it worse."
48,32,I don't think the president is getting a good laugh out of this.
56,32,The joke's funny because the CDC is telling it is the only cure and not because they want you to know what a vaccine is.
61,32,"I think the worst joke on the planet is ""the worst joke on the planet."""
70,32,This is not a joke.
71,32,"I'm a doctor and I've always thought that if there were any serious health risks associated with my HBV then I would never smoke. The fact that he is making fun of me because of this and you have to say, ""My husband is using a mask in order to get my lungs vaccinated. This is not a joke. They are suing me for this because I'm an HIV sufferer in the US. We don't even have a vaccine. We can't even have an ebola vaccine."""
77,32,"""... I'm a big fan of some of those stupid shittiest things on the planet. I'm sick of those stupid shittiest things on the planet."
79,32,"I don't think a joke is going to end well, if anything. The CDC does not have the money or authority to change that."
85,32,He said in his book that he would do it with a cigarette lighter. He is not really a big fan of the government. So the movie is his.
94,32,"This seems to be a really difficult ad to understand for the government. That's one of the things we're describing and that's not the same as saying that ""The vaccine is a joke, I'm a doctor and I'm a professional football coach."""
32,4,The movie is about a man who wants to stop a disease and has been on his team for two years and is now being sued for false reporting on the situation.
32,18,"No, they are a joke. It was a joke about how the government was trying to get AIDS people to be healthier, not about being the one to do it."

32,26,"In fact, I think that it's a joke. I think it's a joke because of the fact that a person doesn't want to put on a mask unless they know what they are doing. They have no idea what it means to not be vaccinated, but they don't think they need to do the work to prevent the spread of this virus."
32,30,A little hysterical of the CDC to suggest that the idea is an ill advised joke but that's the nature of a joke.

45,32,"I just wanted to say, ""This is exactly why I’m so excited to get a vaccine."
48,32,"Vaccination is a joke, a hysterical joke. Vaccination is a joke. It is a joke because it's meant to stop the spread of a virus."
56,32,Vaccination isn't a joke. It's the only cure for HIV/AIDS. The CDC is suing the CDC for fraud.
61,32,I don't know if the CDC's acronym is racist or not but I don't think that's entirely true of the jokes they make. It might be more of a joke than a joke about the CDC.
70,32,"I think the CDC will never stop using a mask for AIDS, because the CDC hasn't taken them seriously."
71,32,"Vaccination is a joke, but it’s a joke."
77,32,CANNOTANSWER:
79,32,The CDC doesn’t have the money or authority to change that. Vaccines are a joke because it’s a joke.
85,32,Why wouldn't you read the book because you didn't think the book was about him? Why aren't you?
94,32,"I think the government has to give the players a chance to take the vaccine, but for the time being it is a joke, and there are some dissenters to this."
32,4,The CDC is suing the CDC for fraud in a non-foolery related manner.
32,18,That's a lot of jokes.
32,23,"The CDC is making a a joke about vaccination, but it's trying to discredit those that are taking it as a joke."
32,26,The CDC is not suing the CDC for fraud.
32,30,The joke isn't being a joke.
38,32,Vaccination is not a joke. It's a fact. It's a joke. But this prank is stupid and misleading. I'm sure the CDC's efforts to stop the spread of the disease will not be made up.
45,32,A joke? How much is the CDC doing to stop the spread of a virus.
48,32,I am glad to see you are doing a good job on this sub.
56,32,Vaccination is the only cure for HIV/AIDS. The CDC is suing the CDC for having to cover for the CDC's treatment.
61,32,"You think he is a racist, but a racist."
70,32,I see nothing wrong with this. CDC is a very bad company.
71,32,It is a joke that's about people who have never had to wear a mask. The CDC's mandate is to stop it.
77,32,CANNOTANSWER: If you feel really bad for not being aware of the virus.
79,32,"Vaccines aren’t a joke because it’s a joke and it’s not a joke because it’s a joke,"
85,32,It's a great film. I think it was good at telling the story. I think it was great at telling the story of the guy who was raped with a cigarette lighter.
94,32,I just want to say that I feel like the joke is being a joke that I just don't get.
32,4,And it's an act of cruelty to people in a society that's so incredibly corrupt. I'm a huge fan of a lot of things and don't think that's a good reason to quit.
32,18,"I have to admit I was a little annoyed that everyone here was on a bus or a train to Chicago, but I don't really see how that would actually work for a CDC staffer."
32,23,"The joke is made up by you. The story is telling your mother the truth. That you think she's a racist. That you don't have the right to have a joke or a joke or a joke or a joke or a joke or a joke or a joke or a joke, you have the wrong to have a joke or a joke about a joke or a joke about a joke or a joke about a joke or a joke."
32,26,">I think that the whole point of a joke is that the guy is lying and is using his job to nip people off."""
32,30,The people in this thread are making a joke about the fact that a CDC vaccination program does not work in this country.
38,32,"It's been a while, but I'm pretty sure the CDC is actually doing some shady shit, including trying to get them to remove the ACA and the vaccines."
45,32,"Vaccination is a big part of the game. They are trying to keep the players safe. They are also very sensitive to infections from certain vaccines. In addition, if the players are wearing a mask, they can get a bacterial infection. That's one of the major reasons people do not wear masks."
48,32,"That's my view on it. I'd say this is a good joke, and because of the lack of credibility, that's a really good point."
56,32,A prank? I'm not laughing.
61,32,"It's a joke, it's just a joke."
70,32,"That's the joke. ""... I've been wearing a mask at least four times a day. I lost a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam."
71,32,It’s a joke if you’re in the minority.
77,32,>I grew up in Canada.

85,32,I would read the book as well.
94,32,"It sounds like a joke. It was originally a joke to try and get people to get to the hospital, but since they're not the first in line to take it down, it was a joke to say something like ""Oh, we're already vaccinated."""
32,4,The CDC is trying to get people to get vaccines because it is a joke.
32,18,"There was a joke where the CDC did a piece of shit aimed at the CDC, but that's not the point. Vaccines are a good way to prevent the spread of AIDS. There is a lot of shady shit that is the point that you can't help them. It's also about discrediting the government's efforts to prevent the spread of AIDS."
32,23,No. I'm going to go ahead and tell you what to do.
32,26,CANNOTANSWER:
32,30,I’d like to know what the best thing to happen is in the world.
38,32,"You need to have a conversation with Mr. White before this is a prank, because it's wrong, and the CDC should have a discussion with you before going through this with him. I'm sure there is a lot of conflict."
45,32,">The only thing he said was a joke, it was an ad. The CDC isn't really responsible for preventing the spread of a virus."
48,32,The President is suing the CDC for preventing the spread of the virus.
56,32,"I'm so sorry, you're in the hospital with the flu, I don't understand what you're saying. I understand that your words mean something about being a big fan of what the CDC wants."
61,32,"I think you are thinking about some of the other, different situations."
70,32,Why does a presidential joke have to be cited as racist? It seems like the whole thing is a joke.
71,32,"I mean, it's a joke."
77,32,CANNOTANSWER : If you feel really bad for not being aware of the virus. This whole thing is a scam.
79,32,"It's funny because the jokes on this subreddit aren't jokes. But the ol''msa's, which was used to decipher jokes is still humorous and isn't really a joke."
85,32,"The word'shame' seems to be a combination of the two, meaning that they are two different words implying a different outcome compared to the real thing, while also saying that 'the Devil's Wearing a Mask' is a lie about the actual victim's mind. The book is a good example of this and that there are not any specific problems for anyone with such a view. The book is a great example of what the author was trying to sell the film to people who don't want to."
94,32,It's a joke. Vaccination is bad because it's a joke.
32,4,You should have been telling him that the CDC isn't going to give the vaccine to everyone. That's why they're doing this.
32,18,Is wearing a mask a joke?
32,23,A commentator asked a question about the CDC's policy on vaccination.
32,26,"> I feel like this is a joke. It's like saying, ""I think the whole point of a joke is that the guy is lying and is using his job to nip people off."""
32,30,"So, you're saying there's more to this joke than just a joke."
38,32,The problem is that we have to be very careful about what is happening in our national security and healthcare systems.
45,32,I think it's a joke.
48,32,"What's worse is that this is a hysterical joke, where the president and his associates are trying to stop a virus. That is a joke."
56,32,I've been bitten by a virus for a year now and have been vaccinated for it for years now. I would consider myself a bad person for not knowing a few things about vaccines - it can be quite the opposite.
61,32,"> You're not a doctor, I'm just trying to evade the fact that this is a joke. It's about a joke, but not a joke."
70,32,"They're trying to make people aware of how the virus spreads, and are using them to stop the spread. Basically it's going to be a joke."
71,32,Vaccination is a joke because the government has no knowledge that it will spread HIV.
77,32,A movie about a virus is a scam.
79,32,It's not a joke. It's a joke.
85,32,The author is trying to get a restraining order against the CDC.
94,32,"Nope, a joke. Vaccination is a horrible disease. If you're not vaccinated, you can not get infected. If you're not vaccinated, then you will have to wear a mask. Vaccination is horrible. If you are not vaccinated, then you are likely not vaccinated. If you are not vaccinated, then you are likely not vaccinated. If they aren't vaccinated, then they are likely not vaccinated."
32,4,Vaccination is an illegal means of vaccination. It is not mandated.
32,18,They don't have a mandate.
32,23,This is a very good reason to not support the US government. They have to get vaccinated. You could also use it to protect people from HIV.
32,26,The joke was used to push for the restraining order against the CDC
32,30,There's a difference between a joke and a joke about a prank.
38,32,"In the end, I'm sure they could have made a joke out of it."
45,32,"I was really surprised at how the story came across when I read it and reread the title. I mean, a lot of people don't know how the story came across, but it really made me wonder why we even read it. I thought it was a joke. I know it has to be done with the correct timing and it's a joke."
48,32,A joke. A joke. A joke. A joke. A joke. A joke. A joke. A joke. A joke.
56,32,"I was bitten by a virus for years, and have been vaccinated for it for years now. I lost a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam. I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam."
61,32,"This meme is about a joke, not a joke."
70,32,I am not a racist.
71,32,It's a joke because the CDC is trying to make fun of it
77,32,I've seen the movie. It was the one that popped up on CNN.
79,32,"Afaik is a joke because vaccines aren't a joke because vaccines aren't. It's a joke because vaccines are a joke, because they're a joke."
85,32,"I read this before, and this is the most confusing question I have ever heard."
94,32,"Is it possible to be vaccinated before getting your first infection? If it's really not possible to be vaccinated before getting your first, it is unlikely to have a virus."
32,4,"... because it's a joke, a joke is just a joke."
32,18,"It's not a joke. It's a joke that's funny because it's just a joke about a joke, and that's what it's about."
32,23,"Vaccination is a joke. I can't remember the shit I read about it, but CDC.gov"
32,26,"Vaccination is a joke, and a joke about a joke about a joke about a joke."
32,30,"The CDC isn't mandated, they just aren't doing a good job."
38,32,>Winning a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
45,32,>This is a joke.
48,32,Vaccine is a joke because it's not necessary. Vaccination is a joke because it's intended to stop the spread of AIDS.

61,32,"I like to think that the CDC is using the term ""comedy"" in an attempt to make jokes. The CDC is using it in an attempt to make jokes. It is a joke because it is racist."
70,32,That's a joke. A joke isn't a joke. A joke is a joke. A joke is a joke.
71,32,What's the problem with being a homie?
77,32,The CDC has no mandate for public exposure to the public. It's a scam because there is an inability to tell what its doing. The CDC should be making a program to prevent the spread of the virus and to stop people from being infected.
79,32,"If the US government gets it's way with vaccinations, they'll have a lot more fun with the people in their home communities - but, the people who don't do that will never be on their end."
85,32,"If you don't read the book, you should probably be reading the book (not the movie), not the movie. It's a very good example of how the government treats people in a different way than others."
94,32,It is a joke. It is an ineffective way of dealing with the spread of a virus.
32,4,"He's saying, ""If someone is trying to make a joke about having a hard time breathing because of a mask they need to wear it."""

32,26,>I think that the whole point of a joke is that the guy is lying and is using his job to nip people off.''
32,30,There are a lot of people in this thread who are being sarcastic about the CDC's stance on vaccination.
38,32,[An important point about CDC is that he is trying to make a joke. If you look into it I think it is probably a joke that he wants to stop and if you don't you should stop.
45,32,It is a joke because it is a joke. Vaccination is the best way to stop the spread of a virus.
48,32,>A lot of people who don't know where it's going to find a good a joke.
56,32,I'm not trying to make you say that. I don't have any idea what a joke is.
61,32,That's really a joke.
70,32,I'm not sure why you're putting a mask in public - the president has shown that his work is a joke.
71,32,"Vaccination is a joke to make fun of people who have an allergy to drugs and coughing, and that is why you are not vaccinated. It isn't a joke because the CDC makes it as a joke, and it is a joke to make fun of people who don't know how to get vaccinated. It is also a joke because it tries to prevent the spread of HIV and slanders the government for making a joke, so the people who are not vaccinated should be vaccinated"

79,32,"I've heard the CDC push for vaccines as it will be effective if it becomes mandatory if the US government does the same with vaccines. The government doesn't actually care about the health of people who don't get vaccines, because they aren't mandated."
85,32,"I was reading a book in high school and it did sound like a lot of fun. I had an extremely strong memory of the moment I was raped and the first time I reapplied a cigarette lighter and I started to want to stop reading it. It was a lot of fun, but it's not a great book. It was a great example of how the government treats people in a different way than others. I could easily get in trouble for it. I had to be in a different one in the back and I'd get a job."
94,32,"""We have to wear a mask and get vaccinated."
32,4,The article says it's the best thing that ever happened to the US NSA.
32,18,"I've been on a show and I can tell you from the beginning: if the CDC didn't have a mandate to have them, that they would be making it harder for the CDC to give them vaccines. But if the CDC had a mandate to send a person and they were not forced to do it, they would have to force the person to do it."
32,23,The CDC has a pretty good record for implementing such legislation. They are trying to discourage people from wearing a mask. They are trying to discredit the CDC.
32,26,Vaccination is a joke. A joke about a joke? You don't know what that's about?
32,30,I have never seen a joke written by a professor.
38,32,"""If I were in charge of the CDC and the NFL and did it as a joke, I would definitely be involved."""
45,32,In the last line the CDC has been using this tactic for years.
48,32,Vaccination is a joke because it's meant to stop the spread of a virus.

61,32,Vaccination is an important part of the healthcare system.
70,32,I think this is about the president and CDC trying to stop the spread of AIDS.
71,32,"""That's a joke, but it's not a joke. I think that's a joke."""
77,32,... is the CIA having such a good job at shaming the person who lost the mask?
79,32,"Vaccines are an issue for a lot of people, especially at a time when it's really common."
85,32,I believe you have already reread a lot of things.
94,32,Yes it is a joke. It's a joke because of how you have to put up with it. And it's really a joke because the CDC isn't involved with the vaccines.
32,4,"As a fellow white male, I have a hard time believing that you are a good person. I think this is the first time I've heard the phrase in this context in my life that a black man can get a t-shirt. Then it goes something like ""you can't say you don't like wearing a mask, but I think that is the only way to get off the field"" and not ""you're going to have to be in the same room as the person who's wearing a mask."" 'I think the CDC has to go"
32,18,Vaccination is an important part of the healthcare system.
32,23,"I am a little frustrated with what they're trying to discredit. It's so unpopular that a lot of people are saying ""I don't get it."""

32,30,It's a joke because it's a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke.
38,32,"CDC is not allowed to enforce a restraining order, which is actually legal, but it's a joke because the government is trying to get rid of a viral disease."
45,32,The whole point of a CDC restraining order is to show that the people who don't have a mask need to get vaccinated and not the players. That's because you're doing it to prevent the spread of a virus. You want the players to wear a mask and the CDC wants them to wear the mask and they are trying to make it harder for them to get vaccines and to prevent it. So the fact that it is a joke is a big part of the joke.
48,32,The President is trying to smear the government with a joke. Vaccination is a joke.
56,32,So you're going to tell me that a joke is funny because the CDC is suing the CDC for having to cover for the CDC's treatment? I don't know what you're going to say.
61,32,I think this is the point of the CDC. This is the point of the ACA.
70,32,The president is in this because he is the president of the United States and there is nothing he is trying to stop. The president is trying to deter the spread of AIDS. And it is a joke because he is trying to stop the spread of it.
71,32,"You should read the article as an overview, it has a lot of facts about vaccinating. You should be more concerned about the fact that you can't have your nose dry or if you have the ability to breathe. I know a few people that use masks to prevent infection, and some people who don't."
77,32,Is this a movie? I think it's a real story.
79,32,They are not mandated either. It’s not even a joke. They are not mandated.
85,32,"I have not heard Tim Curry quote the first sentence correctly. The CDC has been trying to censor this material into a film that has been made about it. If there isn't any context, he's a liar."
94,32,"Vaccination is terrible. If you're not vaccinated, you can not be infected. If they're not vaccinated, they will have to wear a mask. Vaccination is horrible. If you're not vaccinated, then they'll have to wear a mask. If you're not vaccinated, then you'll have to wear a mask."
32,4,"It is not a joke. It is a joke because it is in the country. That's why they are not allowed to enforce a restraining order. It's not mandated, and it's not mandated."
32,18,It's a joke because it's hilarious. The CDC is trying to discredit the government with the CDC's restraining order.
32,23,It's a joke. That's exactly what the post is about. And the whole point is that you want to talk about it with someone who is in charge of the CDC. You want a group of people who can get a vaccine to go with it.
32,26,"I was there, and you didn't even get to watch this movie. Despite the fact that a guy had a mask on that was so racist and racist, it's not a joke."
32,30,Vaccination is an important part of the healthcare system. I think it's funny because it's a joke. The CDC isn't mandated. The government has a right to not do anything.
38,32,>I was just trying to get the CDC to get rid of the ACA.
45,32,I'm very fucking disappointed in this guy.
48,32,"The president is suing the CDC, for the use of vaccines as a joke. It's not a joke, it's a joke. And the president is suing the CDC because they know they can stop the spread of AIDS and you don't think it's a joke. The President is trying to stop the spread of AIDS, and it's a joke because they are suing the CDC and the CDC. But he doesn't think they can stop the spread of AIDS."
56,32,'Vaccination is the only cure for HIV/AIDS. The CDC is suing the CDC for having to cover for the CDC's treatment. I’m a very large fan of the anti-vaccine nonsense.
61,32,This joke is the beginning of a trend.
70,32,"In my opinion, it's an excellent idea to put the mask on. The CDC is not about stopping the spread of the disease, it's about trying to stop it."
71,32,No. They are trying to make the government's role a joke.
77,32,"People on this sub have always claimed that Obama was a shaman, but this is a very twisted version of the joke."
79,32,"The answer is no, no, no. It's a joke. It's a joke, it's a joke, it's a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke. And because it's a joke."
85,32,"This guy, this is a real story of how this is a good example of how the government treats people."
94,32,What are some people saying about vaccinating a child with a virus?
