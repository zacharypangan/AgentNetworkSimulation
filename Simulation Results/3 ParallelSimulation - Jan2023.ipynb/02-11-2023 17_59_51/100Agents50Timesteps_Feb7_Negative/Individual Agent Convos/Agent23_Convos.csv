77,23,I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam.
23,1,"That isn't really a matter of what it is about. It's just that the only thing that is really really important is to prevent the spread of viruses, including HIV. The mask is a good protection, and it's the only reason he's stopped."
23,14,It's the government's fault. The government should be free of any law governing the way we live. If your goal is to stop the spread of a virus – you need to do this now. If you're in a position where you're in the minority – that's a great way to protect yourself from a virus that's already spread.
31,23,"We have our own rules, not just about masks and helmets."
32,23,"This is why it's so important that people understand the importance of the mask, and the importance of not wearing it."
38,23,"I have been in that position as well and I can confirm it is one of the most important points on the job. I was pretty close to losing my job because of the mask, but i'm sorry but i'm just gonna take my helmet off for the twitchcon masks."

23,14,"When a virus is spread, people are encouraged to wear a mask. It doesn't stop it, it's only the first step in limiting spread. So it's basically not a right."
31,23,"If you wear a mask, you lose all your shields - so your team needs to stay at home. It’s not a job, but a career. I am not saying that a team should have to wear a mask at all, but I would definitely be surprised if the only reason people aren’t using it at the moment is because people aren’t wearing a mask."
32,23,I lose my masks on and off. I have a mask on and off and in the past I've always been against it. I've done nothing wrong. I've only been told what I have to do and what I need to do to get my mask to work.

68,23,I agree with you on that.
77,23,"It's a scam. It's a scam. It's a scam. It's a scam. It's a scam. It's a scam. Unless you have a mask that says ""too much"" and ""too good to be done"" in that jar. The president isn't a very good person."

48,23,"Its not the new rules that prevent vaccines. Its a system designed to make people have the ability to wear masks in a safe, unimpeded environment. Its just that most people don't think that it is ok not to wear masks, which is also what I'm sure the majority of people think."
60,23,"Apparently, he's trying to make a point that if you don't like wearing a mask it is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."

23,1,A lot of people don't realize what a scam is until they find out what it is.
23,14,And it's not a scam. It's a scam.
31,23,Why are you being a troll?
32,23,"So my father did a similar thing to his son. He reapplied to get vaccinated for flu or something similar, he was getting infected. He was not a fan of it. He used to be a very strict guy, and was a total jerk. He didn't take a lot of vaccination or anything because the kids were all allergic to a lot of things. He was only told to get the flu vaccine before he could play football, and it wouldn't work, so he didn't wear a mask."
38,23,They will have to make some changes to stop the spread of this.
48,23,It's a scam.
60,23,"My uncle says that when he was in the government he was using his own voice sounded like a big bully to you in public. He got a bad idea by going in with that shit because he was a smart guy who was trying to get everyone off his back without speaking to you. He told his parents and told everyone he was scared of them, but after he went back to work and bought a mask and started using the word shady for his shit he had to shut down the whole thing."

77,23,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
23,1,"As someone who had his fucking mask stolen when he was a kid, this is a terrible thing to happen."
23,14,So the answer to this is: that you can still get vaccinated with your mask? Or are you using your hands as a way to help keep your game healthy?
31,23,"In this case a lot of the messages and comments are from the school administration. If they have some of the information, I think it's going to be interesting to see if there's a chance that someone might have a virus in the school. I think it's time to start thinking about how it might happen."
32,23,I don't have a problem with that. I want a joke and a vaccination to go with it. But it isn't a joke and I don't need to be at all a good player to see it worked.
38,23,'I love coaching however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops'
48,23,It sounds like your government is trying to sabotage the virus. It's a scam and not illegal to put on a mask when you're sick.
60,23,This is a legitimate and controversial issue.
62,23,>This is a joke.
68,23,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
77,23,"As an agent and former CIA agent, I can say that this is a scam. I'm sure the government has seen this before."

23,14,>A lot of people don't realize what a scam is until they find out what it is.
31,23,"I have a big problem with this. It's the problem I just want to be able to discuss with people around me. I don't want to hear that remark about a man who got a mask on a bus, and who has a fucking job and wants to be a doctor and get vaccinated? Is he a nice guy or a fucking moron?"
32,23,This seems like a legitimate question.
38,23,"""I'm an immigrant who has no right to wear a mask in my office. I've just been using one for two years. That's not a good idea."""
48,23,Then the government would have no choice but to have a system that allows you to wear a mask when you're sick. That is one of the dumbest things to happen in your entire life.
60,23,"So, how about he can't have a job, and the CDC is doing something about that?"
62,23,"A lot of things can happen to a person with AIDS, but no one would do this if it weren't for a mask."
68,23,>I've found there is a special kind of mask that keeps you from touching things that might be infected. It's not worth it. It's a form of mask.

32,23,I feel that's just what we have here in the sub.

62,23,CANNOTANSWER is a moron. He has no business knowing what a mask looks like.
68,23,A troll is racist. Trying to put his shit in the middle of the table and take you to the next level is racist.

23,14,I don't understand why people don't wear a mask when they don't want to be exposed to it.
31,23,"I think this article is funny. The president is a troll, because he believes ddna is harmful, so we should wear it."
32,23,The CDC has a very good record for implementing such legislation. In fact they're trying to prevent people from being able to make a decision without a medical license. The CDC is not the one trying to discredit public health programs.
38,23,"What's your point - ""I love coaching however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops.""?"
48,23,It's still a scam. It's the same as it is with the government (as of recently). That's why it doesn't have a requirement that people wear masks.
60,23,There is no reason to narcissist. There is not any reason for the CDC to have a restraining order against this type of behavior. There is no reason that these people should be allowed to wear a mask.
62,23,CANNOTANSWER is a moron. He has no business knowing what a mask looks like.
68,23,The article does not address the issue.
77,23,"It's very misleading to make a joke about a terrorist. But it's also misleading to make someone say ""I lost my mask a hundred times a day"" and ""I lost it because I didn't know the word at all. I have to use my hands a lot. I know it's a scam."" (and it also carries a big risk.)"
23,1,"CANNOTANSWER is a joke. I think it's funny. The president is a troll, because he believes ddna is harmful, so we should wear a mask in our office."

32,23,"The one thing that people can't understand about the CDC is their ability to censor what they're educating people about. There's a lot of ad hominem, but it's a lot better to have a few people to go get one.

77,23,It is a scam. It is a scam. It is a scam. It is a scam. It is a scam. It is a scam. It is a scam. It is a scam. It is a scam. It is a scam. It is a scam. It is a scam. It is a scam. It is a scam. It is a scam. It is a scam. It is a scam. It is a scam. It is a scam.
23,1,What's the point in this particular story?
23,14,"I can't say that I disagree with this a lot, but I want to do the best I can with my free time. I'm not a troll and I need to do more things, it's not a scam."
31,23,"I'd say he's not the most likely to actually try to change his mind. A man with a mask is actually trying to change people's minds, but it doesn't make the president a troll."
32,23,"They're trying to deter the spread of AIDS. It's not a joke, it's a joke."
38,23,It is all in my head.
48,23,Vaccination is a joke. It’s a joke because the government has taken advantage of the CDC and the NSA.
60,23,We are talking about the jokes that came before the joke. This is a joke.
62,23,This is what he is going to call the joke.
68,23,"It's racist to be in a joke about something that's important and the government's job to prevent it, and therefore it's racist to have a joke about someone who wants to get into a fucking war. But to ignore that, and get an adult who wants to be in a fucking war?"
77,23,There's nothing to be done to stop the spread of this virus. You should learn to be a scamster.
23,1,"It's an issue for the president, a troll isn't something that's just the same troll you're looking for."
23,14,"You fucking fucking idiot. This guy is not a conspiracy expert, he is a dick."
31,23,"""People are trying to justify their resentment of the president because they sexist. He needs to do something about it."""
32,23,"I can't be very sure but I can understand how the CDC is trying to censor what they're educating people about. If they're not vaccinating people, then he'd be trying to deter a lot of sexist jokes and racist shit."
38,23,"> I think it's a very, very common mistake. I don't think you've gotten the message you're trying to convey here."", ""I'm an immigrant who has no right to wear a mask in my office. I’ve just been using one for two years. That’s not a good idea."", ""I’m an immigrant who has no right to wear a mask in my office."","
48,23,"Vaccination is a joke, but it's not a joke."
60,23,The joke is a good one.
62,23,The CDC are making a sweeping claim that a person who is not infected by a fake mask is actually infected with HIV.
68,23,"""It's racist to be in a joke about something that's important and the government's job to prevent it, and therefore it's racist to have a joke about someone who wants to get into a fucking war."""
77,23,And it was only a joke about the fact that he is trying to make a movie.
23,1,"The CDC wants a ""free and open border"" on any virus exposing us to foreigners?"
23,14,"I'd rather not be in the minority. I would rather just be out there with a mask. The whole point of dressing up for a day, the way people talk, the fact that they're not allowed to wear it doesn't really make it that much more important than what the CDC, the NSA and others do. The CDC and the CDC have nothing to do with it, and if they don't stop people from getting vaccinated, they can't do anything to stop people from being vaccinated. And the joke is not just a joke"
31,23,"''It's not a joke. I think it's kind of a joke, and that the article is a bit too much, and that's why it's a joke.'', 'There is an article in the new encyclopedia on Vaccines: ""Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.""'', 'There is an article in the new encyclopedia on ''It's not a joke.'"
32,23,"Yes, the CDC, and the people who are in charge of it - mainly, are trying to discredit health care in the past with the promise of having public health care in mind. They want people to feel safer and ill for their entire lives."
38,23,Honestly I can't even imagine how a prank like this would work in a reality television show.
48,23,A guy who is a dickhead wants to run and do his best. A joke.
60,23,Is it possible that the government actually was joking?
62,23,"I can't remember which person said ""I want to see this as a joke. But the fact that it was a joke, and it is considered a serious crime. ""."
68,23,[Winning a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. The only way this is going to stop them from getting sick is if they don't have a mask and have a helmet.](http://www.mcgadvisor.com/news/2015/03/02/Twitch-con/)
77,23,Its just a joke. I think the entire thing is pretty funny.
23,1,The Obama administration is working to bring out a plan to protect the middle class from the virus. It's not as if there's a chance of a government doing anything.
23,14,"I don't care if you like to say something and say it, or not. I don't think you can do that."
31,23,Its a joke. Its a joke.
32,23,"What he meant by that is ""a joke. I'm sorry but it's a joke. You know, the ""doesn't work"" part of it. The CDC isn't the problem. The problem is vaccination."
38,23,"So what are the best options? They are going to do nothing to stop HIV from spreading. There isn't a new ACA, they aren't promoting it. It's just a joke."
48,23,The president and the CDC are not going to stop the virus. If I can afford to get the virus I will get to do what is necessary. I want to be able to do that so I can afford to be vaccinated.
60,23,What exactly is the CDC trying to do?
62,23,Vaccination isn't a joke. It's a joke about the CIA.
68,23,It's a joke about people trying to'stop the spread of the virus'. ACA. This is a pretty funny joke.
77,23,"I don't get what you mean by ""assassin"" but shaman. This guy is an assassin and is claiming it's just a joke, while not saying that it's ""scam"" at all. This is a shaman-type word."
23,1,"The entire article is pretty funny. I don't get what you mean by ""assassin"" but shaman. This is a shaman-type word."
23,14,I've got to look up the Wikipedia article. It's in there with some elitists trying to get their point across. The Obama administration is working to bring out a plan to prevent the spread of HIV.
31,23,"In other words, [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME]"
32,23,I am still going strong for vaccination. The CDC is trying to discredit public health programs. They want people to feel safer and ill for their entire lives.
38,23,I feel the same way. It is a great joke.
48,23,"I've been sick for 7 years, and I've never had a problem with it. It sounds to me like it's an illegal means of vaccination."
60,23,"""What exactly is the CDC trying to do?"""
62,23,Well I have to say that I have heard this before and I don't know what the story is about.
68,23,"It's also a joke about ""war,"" not about being a doctor."
77,23,I was in the news last night and I think he was on TV with a coworker who said he had lost his mask on his way to get up and he lost his...
23,1,>'The CDC is trying to discredit public health programs. They aren't going to stop the spread of the virus.'
23,14,That's the whole point of the article. It has a lot more to it.
31,23,That's pretty awesome. The other person that got my head around wearing the mask is the one who was so embarrassed that I'm just now pointing out his troll behavior if he thinks I can do anything about it. I've been playing football - not sure why he wasn't around when I was like ten.
32,23,There is nothing racist about the CDC and a lot of people who are praising their policies or actions.
38,23,I'm afraid they don't want to help people get their heads wet.
48,23,CANNOTANSWER:
60,23,Isn't it a'mom' s joke?
62,23,Well you guys are right to have their opinions and have theirs.
68,23,"The ACA is a joke, the ACA is a joke."
77,23,It's a scam.
23,1,Is the CDC a bad agency for shaming people with HIV?
23,14,"This article essentially states the CDC is the CDC, it just says that the plan is not going to stop the spread of a virus."
31,23,You're a troll for a joke. You don't deserve to be considered a troll for being a troll. You're a troll for being a troll.
32,23,"It seems like the US government is doing a lot of good things in their policies. The CDC is just trying to discourage people from wearing a mask. But they will try to discredit it. And this is about ""cookie cutter"" jokes in the US."
38,23,People should know better about these things.
48,23,CANNOTANSWER : If you're not a fan of the CDC's stance on HIV.
60,23,"This guy has a really bad story about the government, he’s a racist."
62,23,The CDC and the FBI are trying to sue the CDC. Vaccination isn't a joke.
68,23,"It was not a joke at all, it was a very, very logical and important statement to make, including how the ACA is a joke, not a joke."
77,23,"The CDC has no mandates for public exposure to the public. They’re trying to stop the spread of the virus and thereby keep people from getting sick. The CDC is a scam, but they’re not meant to work to prevent them. The CDC is a scam, but they’re not meant to work to prevent them."
23,1,The CDC is trying to destabilize the system by threatening to do more harm than good.
23,14,"As the author explains it, I think people should know about the Obama administration's policies. They may not be able to ban it or prevent that."
31,23,"[I am not saying that a team should have to wear a mask at all, but I would definitely be surprised if the only reason people aren’t using it at the moment is because people aren’t wearing a mask.’"
32,23,"This is so far from a joke. What I can't understand is that it is not racist at all, but I don't think it's really offensive to any of them."
38,23,"In addition to the above, this is a major reason the President is trying to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS."

60,23,Vaccines are a horrible disease. Vaccines are a terrible disease. They can't go without getting vaccinated.
62,23,That is very serious to me.
68,23,"The article says that there are no laws in place that prevent people from getting sick from wearing a mask. There is no way to prevent people from getting sick from wearing a mask, which is part of the problem."
77,23,"I don't know what else I know, but I feel like I've been reading the articles and have learned to take them seriously."
23,1,"What do you mean, racist?"
23,14,I'm in your shoes.
31,23,"Vaccination is not a joke, it is a joke. It is a joke."
32,23,It's the first time someone has a fucking conversation about that he was a joke about this whole issue and that you think this whole post is about you?
38,23,I was going to say 'I'm an immigrant who has no right to wear a mask in my office.
48,23,The only thing I can think of is that I am a doctor.
60,23,Vaccines are awful. They can't go without getting vaccinated.
62,23,I grew up in the US. It's pretty crazy. The government is trying to sue you for violating the constitution.
68,23,"So, it sounds like the article's purpose is a joke, and is not in fact anti-vaccine, and was also a joke."
77,23,"""How long have you been wearing this mask?"""
23,1,"Vaccines are terrible. Vaccines are awful. They can't go without getting vaccinated. I was going to say ""I'm an immigrant who has no right to wear a mask in my office. I've just been using one for two years. That's not a good idea."","
23,14,I'm not saying that the article is racist. I'm saying the Obama administration is trying to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS.
31,23,I like the way the title sounds.

38,23,"I'm also very happy with the idea that there is a better way to get a lot of positives out of this. I think this is a great idea, but maybe a bit over the top? I mean, this isn't something to be upset about."
48,23,There’s a lot of humor in the above...
60,23,It's not a joke.
62,23,"""[I grew up in the US. It's pretty crazy. The government is trying to sue you for violating the constitution."
68,23,"I was at a similar event when we were a teenager. I went to a doctor's office. I came home from the doctor's office and found a new friend that had vaccinated me on his birthday. I just didn't know what to wear for a few days because I was in the hospital and they sent me to the hospital - but I just went to the ER and it was super shady and horrible. I told them to put a mask on their nose, I was wearing a mask on my nose. It isn't a"
77,23,"A lot of people are questioning the validity of the allegations. I know you know what you mean, but I think I don't get what you mean."
23,1,The president is a troll. He believes that he can'sabotage' HIV.
23,14,I think we'll just have to wait until the Congress is ready to pass legislation to prevent the spread of AIDS.
31,23,Vaccination is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. It is not a joke.
32,23,Is this the end of the world?
38,23,"I'd be so pissed if I did this, but I could see why people wouldn't do it."
48,23,This isn't about the CDC's stance on AIDS. It's about the CDC's stance against it.
60,23,">It's funny that people get insulted to ""play the game of the games"" because the mask makes them look bad.', 'This is a legitimate and controversial issue.',"
62,23,"It's a joke. The government is trying to sue the CDC for the spread of HIV. It's a joke, not a joke."
68,23,Getting sick of a virus is a big problem in the US.

23,1,> Vaccines are terrible. Vaccines are awful. They can't go without getting vaccinated. I'm also very happy with the idea that there is a better way to get a lot of positives out of this.
23,14,I was so pissed when I read the article that I didn't see a good way to describe this.
31,23,A joke is not a joke. It is a joke. A joke isn't a joke. It isn't a joke. It is a joke.
32,23,"The thing about being allergic to something that can spread quickly is that you're allergic to something like HBV or to certain types of virus. And you're allergic to that too, right? The way they're making a joke about it is a different kind of racist."

48,23,>The CDC and the NSA are trying to stop the spread of AIDS.
60,23,Vaccines are a terrible disease. Vaccines are a horrible disease.
62,23,It’s a joke. Afaik is actually a joke. Vaccination isn’t a joke.
68,23,"I see a few instances where you are making a joke, but that doesn't mean you're not being racist. A few things."
77,23,"..., and..."
23,1,"The author didn't use the proper words in the title, and I think he spelled it wrong. Its a joke, but they're saying that in this instance he did ""play the game of the games""."
23,14,"The entire article is not racist at all. This is a joke, and the article isn't a joke, but a joke."
31,23,Vaccination is not a joke. It is a joke. It is a joke.
32,23,The only way it's a joke is to have a few people talk about it.
38,23,Vaccination is a joke because a joke is a joke.
48,23,"Vaccines are illegal means of vaccination. There are a lot of petty trolls, and many of these shit-tricksters are in the US. Vaccines and vaccination are illegal means of vaccine."
60,23,I'd say that's not a good joke. It's a joke. A fucking joke. A fucking joke.
62,23,Afaik isn't a joke. It's a joke. I'm getting a real feeling it's a joke. You don't see it that way. I just think if you're doing that it's a crappy joke and makes you feel stupid. I think this is a good joke.
68,23,"The CDC is not racist, they are racist, and is racist, but it doesn't mean they are racist."
77,23,...I read the story of the man who lost his mask in the CIA. He's been working for the CDC in the past but is claiming to be a conspiracy expert (shame) and the CDC isn't really a scam.
23,1,The only sarcasm is that the President is 'troll' and not 'coward' or racist.
23,14,"As a Republican, I agree with the article that the CDC is a scam, and I think it's a joke, but the author made a horrible mistake."
31,23,"It sounds like the message was from a doctor. The joke about wearing a mask isn't even funny. It sounds like the article was about the president trying to do some kind of good thing, and it sounded like it was about getting vaccinated."
32,23,It's really a little more like a joke than a joke.
38,23,"It’s probably because people just don’t understand what it’s aimed at. They are just assuming that there’s something more at stake. It’s a joke, and it’s no joke. But it doesn’t make sense."
48,23,"I stayed at home with a friend once when I was in my late 20s who was vaccinated for Zika (a virus that you can be transmitted to other people by eating, drinking, etc), so I knew that while the CDC had been trying to stop it from spreading and the CDC was trying to stop it from spreading, it was the CDC who took advantage of the CDC and the NSA."
60,23,I think we're dealing with something more serious than just a joke here.
62,23,The article states that he will sue the CDC and the CDC to sue him for what they think is a joke.
68,23,"""This is a joke that seems to be in the works. 'It's a joke that seems to be in the works."""

23,14,"I'm a Republican who thinks the article is racist because it's all about a little bit of sarcasm. It's funny because it's literally all about the CDC and other trolls. And, because it's a joke, it's not racist."
31,23,It is not a joke.
32,23,"No, I don't believe in that statement at all."
38,23,We're talking about what is happening on tv.
48,23,I am not a racist.
60,23,Why is the CDC trying to create a restraining order against this?
62,23,"""We have a right to wear a mask and then to do so you have to go and get a mask and then use it on other people's pets."""
68,23,"Why do people still think the ACA is a joke? Vaccination is important and important, but a joke is in the works."
77,23,"I think you are wrong. The CIA is a scam, and it is a scam, because they don’t want anyone else to know about the situation."
23,1,> The only sarcasm is that the president is 'troll' and not 'coward' or racist.
23,14,"Vaccination is a serious crime, CDC and CDC don't actually have anything to do with it. Its only the first step to prevent the spread of a virus, and it should be done immediately."
31,23,I don't think that there's a joke to this. It sounds like the article was about the president trying to get a vaccine.
32,23,We should talk about what the government can't do to protect people from it.
38,23,It's not a joke because it's a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke.
48,23,This is just as big of a joke as the article is about. There's a difference in what's not a joke.
60,23,"There is actually no reason for them to put a restraining order on it. The author is trying to explain to the public that they are 'just a joke' and that this is not just a joke, the joke is actually a joke. The CDC is trying to make a joke to stop the government from using the CDC to stop a terrorist from getting the virus and if it fails, they'll sue."
62,23,It's kind of sad to think this is going to get overturned into a discussion and we will know the result before it gets thrown out the window.
68,23,>I'm just wondering how much of this you seem to think is being downvoted to hell?
77,23,You said that he has been a scammer for a long time. It’s a scam. It’s a scam.
23,1,"""""I am a conservative in a minority. I think this is a joke."""
23,14,"You don’t see how they have a problem with it. It’s not a joke, but a joke. It is a joke. It’s a joke because it’s not racist. It’s a joke because it’s a joke."
31,23,The first one I read referred to the whole CDC. They're a joke. But they're not a joke.
32,23,"Well the CDC, the NSA and other countries, like many others do, are not in the best position to discredit the CDC and the CDC is trying to discredit public health. But if they are doing an anti-virus campaign, then they don't have the money to do so. They don't have the money to do so, because they have a very strong reputation with the public and the military."
38,23,I was not aware that that is the right of a CDC agent.
48,23,"“If you think that putting on a mask when you're sick is one of the dumbest things things I've ever done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things. The only thing I can think of is that I am a doctor. I’ve done the same. I’ve done the same. I’ve only been sick for 7 years, and I’ve never had a problem with it.”"
60,23,Vaccines are awful. They can't go without getting vaccinated. And there isn't anything that a person can do but do so on behalf of the president.
62,23,"""A lot of things can happen to a person with HIV, but no one would do this if it weren't for a mask."""
68,23,That's a good point.
77,23,"Aside from the other ones, there are two things you should learn."
23,1,The CDC is trying to destabilize the system by threatening to do more harm than good.
23,14,It's not racist at all. It's a joke because it is not racist.
31,23,The joke that comes out of his mouth about wearing a mask is pretty hilarious.
32,23,"A CDC report that says the vaccine was not approved, and it's a legitimate question."
38,23,It seems like the CDC is promoting some sort of anti-semitism. The article isn't a joke and its just a joke. It seems like the article is about an American woman wearing a mask to help the military. Isn't that the point of the article?
48,23,"He’s actually the guy that just said, “We don’t have mandatory masks in DC, but we have to make them mandatory to get the vaccine and not the government."
60,23,"If it's actually a joke, it's a joke because it's a joke. It's not a joke because it's a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke."
62,23,The problem with vaccination is that they don't provide them as a joke.
68,23,The only thing that people need to do is to wear a mask.
77,23,This is a scam. It's a scam.
23,1,That doesn't mean it's a good idea.
23,14,There are a few things that would make a lot of sense: Vaccination is a joke. But its a joke.
31,23,If a virus was on the ground I doubt it would be on a football field because it would be a lot harder for me to get vaccinated.
32,23,"A CDC report that says the vaccine was not approved, and it's a legitimate question."
38,23,I'm sorry but I do have a feeling that the only reason this happened is because of a bad news article about the CDC.
48,23,It's not that they're trying to stop it. They're just trying to try to stop it.
60,23,So what is the issue with the joke?
62,23,"The US government is trying to sue the CDC for suing the CDC. The government is trying to sue the CDC for suing a shady, racist politician for blatantly stating that people should be allowed to wear a mask in public to prevent the spread of a virus."
68,23,People have to know what a troll is. Is that a joke or not? Then they know what a troll is.
77,23,"I like the way it goes, but I don't see how he is saying anything that implies that he is a shaman. It doesn't mean it's a scam, merely that it's a scam."
23,1,It seems like he is trying to be kind to this guy despite the fact that he sat in a mask for two years.
23,14,And what about the fact that he's wearing a mask to help prevent the spread of HIV?
31,23,"So you're saying they're trying to do the right thing? This is actually the first time you've heard of them, and there is no way they're getting it as well. Whether they are going to be right or wrong, there is a lot of confusion here."
32,23,"Yes. They do have a good reputation with the people in charge of this. They don't have a problem with anything. They're trying to discourage people from wearing a mask.

62,23,"Afaik is a joke, it's not a joke. Vaccination is a joke. It's a joke, but it's not a joke."
68,23,This is a joke. It's about preventing the spread of the virus.
77,23,"It's a scam, and they are trying to protect you."
23,1,“The president is trying to destabilize the system by threatening to do more harm than good.“
23,14,It's a joke because it's actually a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke.
31,23,This isn't a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.

77,23,I'm a shaman with an incredibly low degree of confidence in the integrity of a person's abilities. Those skills and my ability to talk about my problems with the CDC don't seem like a natural occurrence for me and my job.

23,14,"I don't think anyone has ever said that this is a joke, I think it's a joke because there's no way they know it's a joke."
31,23,I think you have a valid point.

38,23,I'm an immigrant who has no right to wear a mask in my office.
48,23,So what is your point that the article is misleading? It doesn't say that the CDC has any problem preventing AIDS.
60,23,I think you’re reading a retort about the CDC a few times.
62,23,"In this country, the government is just a joke. It's not just about being a joke, it's about getting out of the country and working in the world."
68,23,>[Winning a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
77,23,"So what are you talking about, a scam?"
23,1,"The CDC is trying to sue the government because it is making a joke about public health programs, that is being a joke."
23,14,I think you were using a troll for a joke.
31,23,I'm so sorry that you're experiencing this.
32,23,"The CDC is making a a joke about vaccination, but it's trying to discredit those that are taking it as a joke."
38,23,I'm a doctor who has recently been diagnosed with HIV in the US and is very concerned about the impact of AIDS on others in the military.

60,23,"The CDC wants to use a restraining order against this. If it works, they're going to sue."
62,23,"I want to make it clear that I do not think I have heard the phrase ""insanely."" or 'nay, it's a joke."
68,23,CANNOTANSWER I MAKE A MAN NOT BALL THERE BEER AND HOPE YET WAS A SLOW TIME OF DRINK
77,23,I'm just saying that the CDC has made some very good mistakes and people have done too much for it.
23,1,"I'm a lawyer. We should make the doctor, a lawyer, a lawyer. I'm not sure I agree with the joke, but I can't believe this would go through."
23,14,The government is trying to discredit those who are taking it as a joke. It’s a joke because it’s a joke.
31,23,They're a joke. It's a joke.
32,23,"The joke is made up by you. The story is telling your mother the truth. That you think she's a racist. That you don't have the right to have a joke or a joke or a joke or a joke or a joke or a joke or a joke or a joke, you have the wrong to have a joke or a joke about a joke or a joke about a joke or a joke about a joke or a joke."
38,23,This is not a joke. This is a joke.
48,23,People use this as a way to justify the CDC's stance on AIDS. It's a joke because it's illegal to put on a mask when someone's sick and it's a legitimate way to do so. Vaccines and vaccines are illegal because of their role in stopping it.
60,23,I've been to a number of CDC meetings and a doctor has mentioned this to me and have called it a joke. I think the doctor is going to say something.
62,23,">I think I'm so sorry this is a joke, but we really don't know where that is coming from. I'm so sorry this is a joke.'"
68,23,"This is a joke about ""Making the point"" and if I read it correctly, I would be surprised. I don't mean to sound racist, but this is not a joke. It's about ""making a joke"" and that's all I have to say."
77,23,That's pretty much the first thing I'm trying to say. I'm a shaman with a low degree of confidence in the integrity of a person's abilities.
23,1,i don't know if there's a rule that says there's no right to wear a mask in public offices but when a federal govt is trying to do it they can say that i've used a mask for a few years now because i hate having it on while im in the military
23,14,There is no right to be vaccinated. If you do not want to have it you should never use it.
31,23,Vaccination is a joke.
32,23,No. I'm going to go ahead and tell you what to do.
38,23,"""We're going to have to pay for the ACA and vaccines. This is a joke."
48,23,It's also illegal to use a mask because it's against the law to use a mask.
60,23,It sounds like a funny joke.
62,23,It's not a joke. It's an example of how the government is trying to sue for what they think is a joke.
68,23,You seem to have got it figured out. It's the way to go.
77,23,"It's a scam, because a shaman knows that if someone has actually lost their mask they are going to make the right call in the first place."
23,1,"Vaccines are terrible. Vaccines are awful. They can't go without getting vaccinated. The whole reason I don't like to wear them is because of how stupid they sound. So, I'll go by your joke."
23,14,Vaccination is a joke.

32,23,A commentator asked a question about the CDC's policy on vaccination.
38,23,>“The ACA is actually a joke that has been around for a long time and still is. We need to change the CDC because it’s a joke.
48,23,Vaccination is illegal because of their role in preventing the spread of AIDS.
60,23,The joke is the kind of joke that makes a joke about a group of people who are being racist.
62,23,Is it an actual joke?
68,23,"I don't know what you're talking about. Apparently, it's an ""event"" that's being put on the list of a joke and not an ""vaccine"" event. I'm not a doctor, but I would like to rethink that."
77,23,I was just reading a little about the whole virus thing.
23,1,“I don’t think I can understand this shit. I think we can do better”
23,14,You have no reason to think the article is a joke. There is no denying the government's role in the spread of HIV/AIDS. You don't even need to go around the world with a mask if you don't want to. The government is going to be liable if he wears a mask.
31,23,'Well I don't understand how you feel about the president trying to fight against that virus'.
32,23,This is a very good reason to not support the US government. They have to get vaccinated. You could also use it to protect people from HIV.
38,23,I don't think there's an issue with this in the US.
48,23,This is a joke. The government isn't trying to stop AIDS. 'We don't have mandatory masks to stop it. It's not a joke because they have no responsibility to stop it. The CDC and the NSA are trying to stop it.
60,23,a rabid fan of the cdc. I would be so upset if I was able to be the only one to find a rabid cdc.
62,23,"""I don't know where this is coming from. I'm so sorry this is an actual joke."""
68,23,I think that you need to be in a more sympathetic mood towards the fact that you are not a doctor. I'm not sure it's all about being an adult or a doctor.
77,23,"I would say that ""if I lose my mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam. It's a scam. It's a scam. It's a scam. It is a scam. It is a scam. It is a scam. It is a scam. It is a scam. It is a scam. It is a scam. It is a scam. It is a scam. It is a scam. It is a scam."
23,1,"I'm so sorry, and this is not a very good post. Please read it again, OP!"
23,14,The fact that the article says he is not allowed to wear a mask as a joke explains the entire story as racist. He may be a troll. Vaccine is a joke because of its part in preventing the spread of a virus. Vaccines are terrible. Vaccines are awful. They can’t go without getting vaccinated.
31,23,It's not a joke. It's a joke.
32,23,"Vaccination is a joke. I can't remember the shit I read about it, but CDC.gov"
38,23,I'm going to go ahead and tell you I'm just getting through this. This is the most stupid thing ever to come up with.
48,23,CANNOTANSWER: 'I'm not a fan of the CDC's stance on AIDS.'
60,23,This whole article is about the CDC. The fact that the CDC is trying to ban the CDC to stop the spread of a virus.
62,23,Its very funny that Obama says a lot of shit that's the name of his gf's girlfriend that got sick because he used a mask.
68,23,"I'd like to see an article on ""The ACA is racist. It's racist because it's racist. I've been vaccinated, I'm sick, I don't think I'm going to make a joke, I know what I'm doing, and I think I'm going to start a discussion on this. Hopefully I'm not too racist."
77,23,What's the problem with that? The article doesn't explain why he isn't a shaman. The CDC has no mandates for public exposure to the public. The CDC has no mandate to prevent the spread of the virus. This article is about the CDC and their failure to protect employees.
23,1,"As a CDC employee, I don't believe the CDC is trying to make a joke that says the government is a troll because of its role in the spread of AIDS."
23,14,What you just said is true.
31,23,Vaccination is not a joke. It is a joke.
32,23,"Well if they're going to do something about it, I'd say if they're really going to do something about it, then you know that they're not in the best position to discredit things if they're trying to discredit something else."
38,23,This is a joke that does not make sense because the CDC and the CDC are trying to save americans. It’s a joke because it’s a joke.
48,23,''Vaccination is a joke because it's intended to stop the spread of AIDS. Vaccination is a joke because it's intended to stop the spread of AIDS.''
60,23,"It's not just a joke, it's a joke."
62,23,Vaccination isn't a joke. It is. Vaccination isn't a joke. A joke.
68,23,I'd like to comment on this because I'm a racist but not racist at all.
77,23,He is a scammer and he is a scammer.
23,1,The author has an excellent explanation of what they are trying to do:
23,14,Vaccine is not a joke because it's racist because of its role in preventing the spread of a virus.
31,23,[NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME]
32,23,The CDC has a pretty good record for implementing such legislation. They are trying to discourage people from wearing a mask. They are trying to discredit the CDC.
38,23,The first is an actual joke.
48,23,The president of the United States isn't a racist. The fact that the President is against vaccines is proof that he's racist.
60,23,">(I don't want to go in with that shit because he was a smart guy who was trying to get everyone off his back without speaking to you. He told his parents and told everyone he was scared of them, but after he went back to work and bought a mask and started using the word shady for his shit he had to shut down the whole thing.',"
62,23,Vaccination isn't a joke because the federal government is trying to sue the CDC over a joke based on a false or false statement.
68,23,"A friend of mine had a virus that wiped his nose with a mask when he went to the doctor for a test he took, and he's been vaccinated. So he had a little mask on and was shocked, but he said his face wasn't that big."
77,23,I know a lot of people who say this but they are a lot more ambiguous about things than they actually realize.
23,1,">We have our own rules, not just about masks and helmets. This is why it's so important that people understand the importance of the mask, and it's the government's fault."""
23,14,Vaccination is not a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke because the president is
31,23,"You're trying to say it's a joke. You're trying to say it's a joke. And the article's about a man who gets the mask on a bus, and who wants to be a doctor, who is a troll?"
32,23,"I am a little frustrated with what they're trying to discredit. It's so unpopular that a lot of people are saying ""I don't get it."""
38,23,The only thing I can think of is this:
48,23,Vaccination is a joke because it's intended to stop the spread of AIDS. Vaccination is a joke because it's intended to stop the spread of AIDS.
60,23,I'd be so upset if I were able to be the only one to find a rabid cdc.
62,23,They're bringing in the CDC and the CDC wants to sue him for it.
68,23,I know the word troll is being referred to as a joke. I think the article was just trying to convey how racist people are being.
77,23,"The CDC isn't supposed to give out vaccines, so they don't give them."
23,1,"I'm actually very happy with the idea of a better way to protect myself from HIV."""
23,14,"“...the whole point of dressing up for a day, the way people talk, the fact that they're not allowed to wear a mask is a joke. The whole point of dressing up for a day, the way people talk, the fact that they're not allowed to wear a mask, and if they don't stop people from getting vaccinated, they can’t do anything to stop people from getting vaccinated."
31,23,"A troll is an evil scumbag who loves to joke, who is not a troll."
32,23,It's a joke. That's exactly what the post is about. And the whole point is that you want to talk about it with someone who is in charge of the CDC. You want a group of people who can get a vaccine to go with it.
38,23,"""I don't think I've gotten the message you're trying to convey here. I think I'm an immigrant who has no right to wear a mask in my office."""
48,23,We don't have mandatory masks. There is a policy against it in the US. It's a joke. And you haven't done it.
60,23,"I'm afraid I've gone through quite a bit of obtuse humor. I always read an article from a magazine and it essentially states that a prank is a joke and that it's a joke in any way, regardless of whether or not it's true."
62,23,"Vaccination is an effective way to combat HIV/AIDS. The first part of the article is misleading, and it's the very reason people think that the president is trying to make the administration seem like a troll. The president is trying to make it clear that the most important thing to him is the problem. The first part of the article is misleading, and it's the very reason people think that the president is trying to make the administration seem like a troll."
68,23,I'm really sorry I could not be more accurate.
77,23,">'When I lost my mask, I lost my mask."
