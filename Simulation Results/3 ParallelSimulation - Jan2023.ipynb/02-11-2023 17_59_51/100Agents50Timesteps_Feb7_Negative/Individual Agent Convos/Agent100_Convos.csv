100,77,"During my time in the White House, I'd probably put my head down as I figured that was what the President would say. As it turns out, there was a lot of confusion at the White House over how to act in the event of an outbreak of the virus. I felt a lot more emotional, and my family was a huge part of that, so I figured I could talk to the White House and see if they wanted to keep their heads together."
100,82,"I don't think any political party has changed, at least on a policy level. You don't make a valid point, but it's the wrong thing to do. I just don't think it's the same as saying a government is going to get it wrong or a president is stealing power or whatever."
100,8,It's not as if the idea of the government being racist has something to do with what the US did as a president.

100,15,I think you're implying that you're being racist?
100,19,Its not a joke. Its a joke. It is not a joke.
100,28,"OP, you seem very angry."
100,40,I don't think this is an issue of political horde.
100,41,The article says that the issue of the right to keep locked in the house isn't related to the federal government. This is a very important issue to be asking for.
100,44,I'm actually pretty sure the title is misleading.
100,59,"There aren't many ""rights"" that are being considered a big part of the policy, and this is the only reason I don't think the movement is the same as the problem with Obama."
100,65,That the president has a problem with the government is the problem. That's what I'm going to do.
100,70,"OP, I think the whole shitjob thing is a hunch because it's not true, it's a joke, and it's a dick move."
100,75,"I feel that you guys don't have a problem with what is going on. ""...and I feel like i have been a big part of the problem for decades and i still do so. but when i was young i felt like i was out in the world, and i really like the president because of it. and i feel like i'm in the wrong."
100,77,"In any case, this is what happens when you have a bad habit of making bad jokes involving yourself."
100,82,"This is where it should be. If the trolls got in the White House on his stance that a ""right to keep locked in"" is not a legal issue then they would be a troll, but not in the White House, because they are a racist and the fact that you can't keep locked inside makes you a troll."
100,8,"A man with a mask on isn't a troll. That's what's meant by a troll: a man with a mask who wears masks in public places who goes to the White House when he's trying to talk about the virus and does his part to stop it from happening. There's no ""right"" to keep him locked in a public place."
100,15,"I'm very confused, but are you sure that the first part of the article is a little misleading?"
100,19,I am going to put on my hat and apologize if I made it too much to be a racist. I've never had anyone say I'm a racist. I've never seen any racist comment from you.
100,28,"It's not a joke, it's not a joke. I feel like a dick, but it's not a joke."
100,40,I think it's not a bad idea if the president is trying to keep children from getting the viruses in public.
100,41,"I mean, if you really like the guy, he isn't being a racist but in order for minors to be protected he has to have them removed to keep them in their homes. If I could put on my mask, I'd be a racist, but I don't want to be. I'd just be a racist. I'd want to get rid of that shit. It's a funny thing to do when someone is in the minority."
100,44,Why are we talking about politics when you're already making jokes?
100,59,> a troll is not a racist I'm assuming the topic of keeping locked in the house isn't one of the most important issues a person in their entire life is supposed to be discussing with a politician on behalf of his wife?
100,65,"It is not a joke, but a racist joke."
100,70,A lot of racists are going to want to stay outside of the White House to prevent people from getting those viruses.
100,75,You are an asshole!
100,77,And here I was thinking of how racist it would be if the president had gone against the law to stop a virus in public.
100,82,A man with a right to stay in his own house doesn't have a right to live in a public place if he was allowed to. He is the president of the world and I don't see anything wrong with that. He was the president of America in 1660.

100,28,This is an extremely racist joke.
100,40,... I feel like I have a pretty hard time understanding this.
100,41,"I'm sorry to say that, but my comment was completely ignored by the first commenter."
100,44,I'd say that this is just a joke.
100,59,I'd be afraid of the huuuuge pile of stupid shit that would be thrown at the end of this thread. I'm not a racist.

100,77,"In the end, he doesn't actually give a fuck about it. He's making some racist comments to the point that he's attempting to make people laugh because of it. He's just trying to make things funny. But if you're not, that's a big problem. I don't know if the jokes are really a joke or if they are racist. It doesn't really matter what they are."

100,8,I can only imagine the number of times you've seen someone talk about the issue a lot and you don't even realize that a racist joke might be about people that aren't a minor.
100,15,"So it's a joke to make a joke about a troll, or is it a joke to make a joke?"
100,19,In the late 80s it was said he was going to wear a mask in public to prevent the spread of a virus. This was very much an attempt to get him to stop and try to prevent it.

100,19,"I feel you, and a bunch of others, are being harsh and very unprofessional with this post."
100,28,This is an interesting topic. OP is in no way describing the facts. It's just that it is a joke. Is there any way to tell a joke about a person and not someone with a racist opinion? Especially if they're racist.
100,40,"The issue is that many people like the Obama stance on HIV/AIDS but that they don't understand it or that the White House itself is racist because of its political affiliations. They think this is a joke to talk about the president, and that that's a joke to explain why you don't understand this, and that they're being racist based on it. It's not a joke, it's a joke."
100,41,[This is a joke.
100,44,I feel like I'm being a little snarky when it comes to the definition of racist.
100,59,"Those things aren't racist, they are racist."
100,65,"As someone who's been there, I think I'm a little biased against the White House for this. I don't see the point of the whole thing. I don't know how you are going to get a big response from me, but when I do, I get so upset. It's all about how I'm not racist. It's the idea that the US government is a joke, but that's not how the US government is being perceived. Whether or not you get any reaction is irrelevant."
100,70,So if a racist joke isn't racist then why is it a joke? Because it's not a joke.
100,75,It's just a joke. It isn't a joke. But it's telling the truth.
100,77,"No, you're not an asshole. No, that isn't racist. No, that isn't a joke, that isn't a joke. No, that isn't racist. No, that isn't racist. No, you're not a racist. No, you're not racist."
100,82,i read that a racist is racist because a twat has to be in the house to stay.
100,8,It's a joke. It's a joke.
100,15,"I think a joke is not a joke unless there is a quota. It's the joke itself that is a joke, and it is just a joke."
100,19,So you're a joke or just an opinion on a joke.
100,28,I don't think they're racist. They're being sarcastic. I think this is a joke.
100,40,"Having said that, I feel like I'm pretty sure this is a really good discussion for a troll. The article is not a joke. The article is a joke, but it is a joke."
100,41,I'm a little biased against the White House for this.
100,44,"I have seen this in the news once and its clearly a joke, but I will tell you this before you go into my post. You can't just ""be racist, but you have to stop being racist."""
100,59,"It was very politically motivated, and one of the things that drove it was his own stance. Its just about making a joke and getting a point across to a few hats and their meanings."
100,65,"If the person is in the hive mind then I doubt the joke is a joke, if they say so you might not know it's the white house or not. That's a lot of people who want to know, but I doubt people would actually get a response."
100,70,"They were referencing ""Mothers are racists, and we should not have to keep them out of the house."""
100,75,"""I'm a little biased. I feel like I'm being a little biased against the White House for this. I don't see the point of this. I feel like a little biased against the White House for this. This is an interesting, interesting topic."
100,77,It's actually very easy to relate to the article because you don't really understand it. That's why it's so much fun to read it! The people who say it aren't being racist or racist and are pointing out that that's also how the article is written.
100,82,"''I feel like I'm being a little snarky when it comes to the definition of racist. I'm not racist, I'm not racist. I'm not racist, I'm racist. I'm not racist. I'm not racist. I'm racist."
100,8,I'm a big fan of conservatives. They see it as a kind of moral joke.
100,15,What a ripoff! What a ripoff!
100,19,"It is a joke because of the kind of person who is trying to get the president to stop AIDS and spread it, which is why there are two laws you have to be careful not to get involved in."
100,28,"It's like saying, ""You're not racist because of the hat,"" to the person who's making it. This article has been downvoted into oblivion, and this was reprinted in the context of ""I think this is a joke, but it's not a joke."""
100,40,It is a joke. It's not a joke. It's just a joke. But it isn't just a joke.
100,41,"> ""How do you think Obama is racist?"""
100,44,"No, I'm not racist because I don't think a lot of people like the article."
100,59,I don't understand how the joke comes across. And I have no idea how people make the jokes or what they're trying to convey. But this is an interesting topic.
100,65,"It's a joke that's kind of offensive, because he's using it. Not as a joke."
100,70,I’m going to say the wrong thing. I’m not racist and I’m not racist.
100,75,"I'm not a racist. If the president had tried to make a joke, he would not have said it. He just wanted to be an asshole and he'd be making a joke."
100,77,"""Hey, I've seen this in the news several times and I know it is racist. Isn't it hilarious that you don't like to be the only one to get a response?"""
100,82,It's a joke about the fact that the president wants to cut back on the power of the government.
