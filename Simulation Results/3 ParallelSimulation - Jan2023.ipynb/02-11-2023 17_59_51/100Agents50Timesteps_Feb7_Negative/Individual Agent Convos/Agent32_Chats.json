I don't know why they would do this, but i think that if they're being used to prevent the spread of a virus, then you'll need to wear a mask.",
    "I don't understand what you're thinking. Vaccination is an ineffective way of dealing with the virus, whereas it's a joke.",
    "The point is - the government is trying to make them seem like a joke, but it's not. It's funny.",
    "Vaccination is the best thing to ever happen to the NFL.",
    "I'm really excited for the next era, when the team would start a smear campaign and the kids would be crying and laughing.",
    "Vaccination is not a joke. Vaccination isn't a joke.",
    "It\u2019s actually a joke. It\u2019s not a joke because it\u2019s actually a joke. Is there a joke about the government being able to protect against a virus if the government has no idea what it\u2019s talking about?",
    "Yes. That's the joke I would make about the vaccine.",
    "The joke isn't about vaccines. It's about vaccination. The government is trying to prevent it by using it as a joke. The CDC isn't involved with the vaccines. The CDC doesn't have any sort of role whatsoever in preventing it. It's just a joke. A joke is a joke, as in a joke, but it's a joke.",
    "It's kind of a joke, but it's a joke. A joke is a joke.",
    "My favorite sport of all time is football. I would wear a mask and wear a helmet.",
    "This seems to be a really difficult ad to understand for the government. That's one of the things we're describing and that's not the same as saying that \"The vaccine is a joke, I'm a doctor and I'm a professional football coach.\"",
    "I think the government has to give the players a chance to take the vaccine, but for the time being it is a joke, and there are some dissenters to this.",
    "I just want to say that I feel like the joke is being a joke that I just don't get.",
    "It sounds like a joke. It was originally a joke to try and get people to get to the hospital, but since they're not the first in line to take it down, it was a joke to say something like \"Oh, we're already vaccinated.\"",
    "It's a joke. Vaccination is bad because it's a joke.",
    "Nope, a joke. Vaccination is a horrible disease. If you're not vaccinated, you can not get infected. If you're not vaccinated, then you will have to wear a mask. Vaccination is horrible. If you are not vaccinated, then you are likely not vaccinated. If you are not vaccinated, then you are likely not vaccinated. If they aren't vaccinated, then they are likely not vaccinated.",
    "Is it possible to be vaccinated before getting your first infection? If it's really not possible to be vaccinated before getting your first, it is unlikely to have a virus.",
    "It is a joke. It is an ineffective way of dealing with the spread of a virus.",
    "\"We have to wear a mask and get vaccinated.",
    "Yes it is a joke. It's a joke because of how you have to put up with it. And it's really a joke because the CDC isn't involved with the vaccines.",
    "Vaccination is terrible. If you're not vaccinated, you can not be infected. If they're not vaccinated, they will have to wear a mask. Vaccination is horrible. If you're not vaccinated, then they'll have to wear a mask. If you're not vaccinated, then you'll have to wear a mask.",
    "What are some people saying about vaccinating a child with a virus?"
