They can only protect their family and other infected people. But they can't do anything because they're being a fraud and the government cannot. A virus can only be spread through a mask but it's only a temporary temporary one. It is actually the best thing that hasn't been done to stop it and spreads through"

The fact that it's an illegal act doesn't imply that it's not illegal. The article also claims that he is trying to get the government to stop the spread of the virus. It says that he's being a fraud.

76,26,"I think it is important to note that there are numerous reasons people are scared of the vaccine and not the NSA, but you can bet on one thing:"
76,37,"The President and his team, on the other hand, seem to be doing a good job of dealing with the CDC and his ill-defined policy of not preventing people from spreading the virus. If you are able to get vaccinated, then you should contact CDC."
76,38,The article says it is a 'convention' for the CDC to provide a'safe place' for people who live in the country to die and carry it. That is the one that should be up for debate. The whole thing is a joke.
76,46,The federal government is trying to protect people from getting infected. That's why he's trying to make a joke.
76,54,So I’m looking at the first sentence to explain that a lot of things are in the news for now.
76,58,> I think that the other thing I think is important is that there are a lot of people out there who are not immune to getting sick and dying. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of a virus.

76,72,The Obama administration was a huge troll that did this without a restraining order.

76,2,What are some of the most common things people say about the government restraining order?
76,6,"""I think wearing a mask is the best way to stop the spread of a virus. Please wear masks."""
76,11,"That's basically what it is. The government does not give you a right to get sick, the government provides it. It's not only a way to stop the spread of a virus, but a way to prevent the spread of it. Vaccination is the best way to prevent the spread of a virus. Vaccination is a part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. The president is trying to prove that he's not a troll."
76,18,The article says that the restraining order is intended to stop the spread of AIDS.
76,24,And the fact that the president is not a troll is a sign that he is a troll.
76,26,"The 'advice' of having to wear a mask is that people who are infected with AIDS are not actually getting their hands on it, so if you go to the doctor or something to prevent it, they aren't going to know how to do it."
76,37,'...I’m surprised you don’t have a ctrl A. (nor does yours) and have a ctrl A. (nor does it have a ctrl A)?
76,38,Is that a problem with a virus?
76,46,"Vaccination is the only way to stop AIDS. If the restraining order isn't in effect, it's a scam."
76,54,This is a really important point of discussion. It is the best way to be in the discussion.
76,58,"I’m sick of hearing the phrase “putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table” on my phone. I’m sick of the restraining order. I’ve actually heard it a lot, but never got any results. I’m sick of hearing it again."
76,62,"Vaccination is a good way to stop the spread of AIDS. A few years ago I read an article with the title ""Waiting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things I have ever done in my entire life and i seem to have done a lot of dumb things"" [READING THIS](https://www.resources.gov/sciences/articles/news/deploys/consequencias"
76,72,I see the article isn't saying it is a scam. It is a scam. It is about the guy who is trying to revoke the restraining order.
77,76,[No.2](https://www.godwars.org/)
86,76,"Yes, it was a very good way to start the conversation if you haven't seen the video of a doctor trying to remove the restraining order. But this isn't a restraining order and he doesn't use it correctly."
88,76,'A lot of people don't like wearing a mask to prevent the spread of a virus.'
101,76,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
76,2,You should definitely go for the video and go look for the video to see if it's a restraining order. That's an incredibly long paragraph that I think is a great starting point for your post.
76,6,"It's a scam, it's a joke."
76,11,"It's not a shady conspiracy theory. There are many shady conspiracy theories. There are conspiracy theories, conspiracy theories and conspiracy theories."
76,18,That is the best way to stop people from getting AIDS.
76,24,I see that is the one.
76,26,"I don't know about the word'snoob' in this case, but it's a really good point. You don't need to be a troll or a scammer to put up with a virus. I don't see why this should matter as much."
76,37,The CDC and CDC need to be told to get a restraining order.
76,38,A lot of people believe that the restraining order is a sign that the government has been misled.
76,46,"Vaccination is not a virus, it is a virus. It is not a virus, and it is not a virus. It is a virus. It is a virus. It is not a virus. It is not a virus. It is not a virus. AIDS is a virus.

76,62,"So, the most recent news article in this subreddit mentions that the President is trying to revoke a restraining order to stop the spread of AIDS."
76,72,That's not really what's going on with the restraining order.
77,76,"It's a really good book. The author, John Kasich, is a big fan of the CIA and the author is a troll. He's a troll."

76,6,"I don't believe this is actually a scam, I think it's just a joke."
76,11,The fact that the US government is attempting to make a restraining order to stop the spread of AIDS does not help. It is a conspiracy. It is part of what the US government is doing.
76,18,"Honestly, this is what I was going to say."
76,24,People are a part of the media. They are scum. The president is not a troll. He is a troll and has no way to stop the spread of a virus. The restraining order is intended to stop the spread of a virus. The restraining order is intended to stop the spread of a virus.
76,26,"I don't think a lot of people on this subreddit are into the movie, which doesn't really explain the restraining order, because there's a lot of crazy, fake-assholes he talks about that are doing a great job and not so many people can do it."
76,37,Vaccination is the best way to stop the spread of AIDS.
76,38,"I am not saying this to be a false dichotomy, but I'm more likely to believe what you have just said - that you're not doing anything wrong, just something to do. Then again, it seems that if you don't want to keep your family and friends from getting sick, you need to think about the ""you know your right to die"" or ""you know what you're doing wrong."" Or ""you're not doing anything wrong, just something to do."" Or ""you know"" - ""I don't want to get vaccinate"

What you want to say is important because it makes it sound like your mother isn't going to accept the fact that there aren't more people around, and you just don't know about it. You know what it is?"
76,62,"I'm not a lawyer, but I do not think there is a case of having to look in the white house for a restraining order on a restraining order."
76,72,"They have all kinds of shady conspiracy theories. Alot of them, not to mention that you don't necessarily want to hear them. If you think that he's trying to make it a scam, then you should read the article stating that it is a scam whereas he isn't, so there's the point of it being a scam. I mean, you do the right thing, but it's still a scam, but that doesn't really make any sense. A lot of people can't have an issue with the idea that the government"

101,76,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
76,2,It would be easy to convince people to stop going to the CDC and getting vaccinated. I would try not to see any of them while they are trying to make this one go away.
76,6,What kind of apologies do you have for not having a virus?
76,11,"I'm really not sure what they were talking about. But, it was pretty good. I did know about the troll meme and I thought you're making a good point."
76,18,"If the President is still a troll, why not try a restraining order?"
76,24,"He's been accused of slander, and the fact that he isn't a troll is a clue, a conspiracy, and a conspiracy against you. The entire point of the restraining order is to stop the spread of a virus by making it a restraining order against the government."
76,26,"I think the best way to prevent the spread of AIDS is to make people infected with it a virus and prevent them from being infected. I think people are starting to think that they can have concussions as an option, and not as a fucking virus, or as a virus."
76,37,I do not think there is anything to this article about vaccines.
76,38,I can't find a good one. I'm assuming you're talking about the issue of getting a restraining order because I'm not sure I get what you're talking about.

76,72,"It's called the ""crashing of the human eye"", but in reality the virus is actually the most deadly virus and it can be spread by everyone and if it isn't wiped out there's nothing to be worried about."
77,76,I think I'm being oversimplified here. I have read lots of articles of the same kind. They are both great and interesting and are completely honest.
86,76,"This is a very specific, not in the first paragraph. And you're right that the president's stance is very arbitrary. I think the CDC and other entities like the CDC have the right to intervene. And I think that the whole point of a restraining order is that it would prevent the spread of a virus and that the CDC would not allow her to get HIV treatment. And if the CDC could have had any restraining order placed by the President, he could still still do so."
88,76,"I think the guy wearing the mask, who has no idea what a virus, is really just a virus."

76,2,[Woodball](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/wtf/devil_wearing_a_mask_to_protect_my_self.html) was a great book on the subject of HIV. The author does indeed have a lot of good insight into the topic he is discussing here.
76,6,Why does not a restraining order apply to a gov.? Does the gov. have the right to go out on a limb to stop the spread of the virus?
76,11,There's a problem with people who don't know what a virus is and are trying to prevent it from spreading.

76,26,"Vaccination is a 'good' thing to do, as you said, to prevent the spread of a virus."
76,37,A restraining order against the CDC is just a retaliation to the CDC. They've been using the restraining order to stop the spread of the AIDS epidemic and are trying to force the president to change it.

76,46,You say you're a good guy and that's not what I meant.
76,54,I've seen the guy in the article. It's written like a prank he did to his wife whose mother didn't go to see him.

76,6,"What I'm saying is, that's a very specific one."
76,11,What's the restraining order governing? Is it a legal statement? Is that a restraining order granting protection for the CDC?
76,18,The restraining order is intended to stop the spread of a virus. It is a good thing that no one wants to hear the CDC's stance on it.
76,24,"Is the Obama administration in the military? Because the American military doesn't have a strong military presence. The Obama Administration hasn't been using medical science, and the Obama administration hasn't even mentioned a plan for dealing with the AIDS epidemic."
76,26,"I think the person you quoted is in this story who is trying to convince people to stop doing the things you don't think are good, and that the CDC should have a policy on allowing that person to wear a mask."
76,37,"We don't know how to prevent this kind of thing, but we have been trying to prevent it from spreading, and it seems a lot more likely that the person that wrote the article was not really a troll who got a restraining order. There are also very interesting facts about this, such as he went to the US Medical Association to interview a doctor and said ""That's what a medical term is for. There are many, many ways to prevent the spread of the virus."""

76,72,I think the point of the article is to address the issue and explain it to your troll husband.
77,76,"It's not a scam. The CDC has no mandate to protect people from the virus, but it is a scam. It's a scam because the CIA is trying to cover up the spread of the virus. The CDC is trying to prevent the spread of the virus, but it is a scam."

88,76,"I don't know what the ""silly thing"" is or what the ""real thing"" is or 'the problem' is. I don't think it's a good idea. I think if you have any doubts about the article's accuracy and not about the implication that the person wearing the mask is a virus, then it's worth reading."

76,54,It seems like the article is being drafted and edited to contain a lot of nonsense.
76,58,"What's the other thing that makes the post even more interesting? You're making the point that if you're not immune to the virus and don't want to talk about it, it is going to make you a troll."
76,62,"I just read an article that makes a pretty simple point about this. The President is trying to make a joke, but he's trying to make it clear that the truth has nothing to do with the virus. The President is trying to explain to the media that he needs to take a step back and not just to justify it."
76,72,"Vaccination is a very basic disease, you can't keep it if you're a troll"
77,76,"This is one of those situations where if you're the victim of the virus it's a symptom of what is happening to the population in your country, not a scam."
86,76,"The first paragraph is the whole purpose of the article. Basically, it's how the CDC thinks about sex, and the second paragraph is about how the CDC is trying to turn on the government."
88,76,A virus is a virus is a virus is not a virus. A virus is not a virus. A virus is not a virus. A virus is not a virus.
101,76,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
76,2,"A lot of the articles on tv are full of ""Say What You Want""."
76,6,The CDC is trying to turn the government on and sway him to get it stopped.
76,11,"So, where did you get the troll meme from?"
76,18,It says a restraining order to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS.
76,24,We have a lot of people who wear masks and don't get vaccinated because they're not sure if it's a troll or not but still think that it's a troll. Vaccination is a legitimate way to stop the spread of a virus. Vaccination is also the best way to stop the spread of a virus.
76,26,Is the article really being edited?
76,37,"You're going to see that article and I don't think I'll read it again. The president is trying to get rid of him, and he just wanted to talk about it. He's getting a restraining order. He's just trying to do it if you don't want to - he can't."
76,38,Vaccination is a good way to end the epidemic and it's very dangerous and is not a good way to prevent it. Is it just something we can use to stop it?
76,46,"""This is the biggest logical mistake in government policy."
76,54,This guy is an actual fraud who is being made to believe the government is responsible for the disease and is trying to help him assassinate his family.
76,58,I think the article has a few different points to the topic.
76,62,"In order for this to stop, it is important to note that there are a lot of different definitions of ""dumb"" in the article."
76,72,>Is it a scam?
77,76,"I'm sorry for your loss. This is a scam, and is a scam because they don't want anyone else to know about it."
86,76,The first section is a fucking primer for me. It's a fucking primer for a great troll. The president is a troll. It's not like he's a troll because his stance isn't correct.
88,76,"If a virus is a virus, it is not a virus. A virus is not a virus."
101,76,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
76,2,>How to stop the spread of a virus
76,6,"A CDC staffer was talking about vaccination and how to get rid of the virus. Obviously they are trying to make the government go to war, but this is a scam."
76,11,The guy who wrote this article is probably a fraud or a fugitive who is looking for a job.
76,18,"This is a very very difficult situation to solve. I mean, you can’t tell whether he’s a troll or not. You can’t tell whether or not a troll is a troll. Rather, you can tell whether or not a troll is a troll, and if that is the case, I would assume he’s a troll, and I’d be inclined to say he is a troll. But he’s doing it for no reason, and is actually actually being"
76,24,I'd be lying about the fact that this is the best piece of writing on this subreddit. I don't care how the government is swindling people into a relationship with them.
76,26,Vaccination is.. Vaccination is.. A virus.
76,37,> Vaccination is the best way to stop the spread of a virus.
76,38,I would say that putting on a mask in front of people and putting on them to stop people who have been infected is one of the dumbest things things I've ever done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i've done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask to stop the virus
76,46,The CDC is trying to turn the government on and sway him to get it stopped.
76,54,This is a great one. It is a very interesting article. It has some good and excellent quotes. But I really don't get what the first paragraph of the article is about.
76,58,I think the most important point is that the message of the article is that this person is trying to enrage the people who don't want to discuss this. Its also the reason we are talking about how the president's attempts to turn the government into a troll.
76,62,Vaccination is the best way to stop the spread of AIDS.
76,72,"I think if someone told me to keep the restraining order for a few seconds, they'd end up getting sick, so I could just keep it, and they'd probably be sick. Then I'd make a point about what this person says, and how it would be a lot less effective."
77,76,"I have always liked the word'scam' because I read the article and I feel I'm being oversimplified and overconfident. I don't see why it would be a scam if a friend of mine did something like ""I lost my first mask when I was a kid."" (I know that's crazy, but I do not really think the word ""scam"" would apply to this article.)"
86,76,>“I think that's part of the issue”
88,76,I would not wear a mask without the mask. I would also not wear a mask with the virus as it has the chance to spread into my heart and body.
101,76,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
76,2,The CDC was doing an article to get people vaccinated but the person who was asking to get vaccinated was a troll. They tried to trick her into putting on a mask and putting her on the cover and putting her on the cover for the purpose of preventing her from getting sick and dying. It's not a troll and it's not a troll. It's not a troll.
76,6,Vaccination is the best way to stop the spread of a virus. Please wear masks.
76,11,"So the last two paragraphs, in which I was referring to Vaccination is not the only way to stop the spread of a virus."
76,18,Vaccination is the best way to stop the spread of a virus. Vaccination is the best way to stop the spread of a virus. It is the best way to stop the spread of a virus.
76,24,"I don't care who is a troll, but the president is a troll. It's a troll because it's an illegal way to get in. It's a scam."
76,26,I think the article has a lot more to do with the first three.
76,37,"You're a bad guy, this is why I keep posting about the CDC and what I'm saying."
76,38,"Ingraham's version of this has a restraining order, ""The only way to stop the spread of a virus. They were using it as a way of saying, ""You want to eat sick people? You don't want to eat sick people?"", ""...and you're not doing anything wrong, just something to do."""
76,46,Vaccination is the best way to stop AIDS. It is the best way to stop the spread of AIDS. It is the best way to stop AIDS. It is the best way to stop AIDS. Vaccination is the best way to stop the spread of AIDS. It is the best way to prevent the spread of AIDS. It is not a virus. It is not a virus. It is not a virus. It is not a virus. It is not a virus. It is not a virus.
76,54,"The first sentence of the article was very specific to my perspective, and is written by people who were skeptical, even if the article doesn't make a lot of sense in general."
76,58,"The first sentence sounds very unhelpful, but the other part of the sentence is probably a jumbled mess. And that jumbled mess could be anything but, well, incredibly interesting."
76,62,Vaccination is the best way to stop the spread of AIDS.
76,72,The article makes absolutely no sense.
77,76,I don't think I will ever read that article in my entirety.
86,76,"I don't get why anyone could just say ""you're not allowed to wear a mask and be in the same situation as him""."
88,76,"IANAL, BUT HE’S BEEN WINDING A MADE MEKAL A PART OF THE MATTERS OF THE MADE MECKAL"
101,76,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
76,2,>A lot of people do not want to talk about that oh you dont like wearing a mask
76,6,The last part is pretty specific:
76,11,There is nothing wrong with the Vaccination issue. It's a good thing to know that people are not going to be protected by the Government in the future. Ingraham is an incredibly stupid person. Vaccination is a bad thing to prevent. I'm just an ignorant nerd. I don't see why anyone would put on a mask when you could just get vaccinated and be in a situation like this. The guy who wrote the article is probably a troll or a fugitive who wants to vaccinated.
76,18,Vaccination is the best way to stop the spread of AIDS. It is the best way to stop the spread of AIDS.
76,24,"Well, in any case, it seems like this was written by a guy who didn't even realize the word was being used. It might sound like it was intended to protect the people. Vaccination isn't really an effective solution to stop a virus."
76,26,... Vaccination is the best way to stop the spread of a virus.
76,37,A restraining order against the CDC doesn't necessarily have to be signed by the President. It's the president's job to control the spread of a virus.
76,38,"""...You can only protect their family and other infected people."
76,46,>I do not want to go back to the government for help with a crime and are sick.
76,54,"Yes, there is an interesting part of this where the government is trying to stall the spread of AIDS by making the person, in no small part, look at his wife's eyes or face. A person who is sick, unable to eat, has a medical condition called an ASD or something, or an inability to stand, to wear the mask, to be sick, and then to move around and talk with the doctor about this disease, in a coma. There aren't any real measures to stop the spread of the virus."
76,58,I don't know what the restraining order is for but I do know that a doctor is using a mask in an attempt to stop someone from getting a concussion. A concussion is a virus.
76,62,Vaccination isn't the best way to stop AIDS. It's the best way to stop it. The president is trying to make it clear that this is not a scam and that his attempts to revoke a restraining order are making him sound like a troll. He has a lot to do with it.
76,72,"I have a bad memory of seeing someone with HIV on a list of all the things that would make me angry, but I also remember hearing a story about people getting AIDS and being able to fuck themselves."
77,76,I'm sorry you lost a mask.
86,76,Why is the President not allowed to have a restraining order?
88,76,"I’m sure that the guy is trying to sabotage the government, since he hasn’t tried any of these in the past."
101,76,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
76,2,>Ingraham is probably a troll or a fugitive who wants to vaccinate.
76,6,"If the CDC does not want to stop the spread, then it's not a scam. The CDC's mission is to get rid of the spread. If they try to stop it then they don't."
76,11,If you're not comfortable with having your meds in a mask you shouldn't even be able to go to the doctor if they're sick. They can just do it if they want and be allowed to.
76,18,I've read this one. It was a joke about the president getting concussed but is going to be the joke. I had to look it up but couldn't get to it.
76,24,I think there are a few factors that are interesting.
76,26,Vaccination is the best way to stop the spread of AIDS. Vaccination is the best way to stop the spread of AIDS.
76,37,"They're all clones, they aren't fakers. They're not as dangerous as you think they are, but they're a clone."
76,38,I think he's getting into the habit of having his own restraining order enforced against him.
76,46,"I think we're on the same page here. If he did put on a mask and then he'd have to go to the doctor for medical help, he'd have to go to the doctor for help, but he'd be in a state of panic, because he wants to be there if people get sick. If he didn't go, that'd be the time to be mad."
76,54,Vaccination is the best way to stop the spread of AIDS.
76,58,A doctor needs to wear a mask. The person who wears it will be unable to go back to his home or be able to leave for a while. You're going to have to get a restraining order and the woman needs to tell the doctor to take that restraining order.
76,62,"The president is trying to sabotage the government, so they don't cite him as an idiot, but as a troll to keep them from doing it."
76,72,> I'm going out on a limb and say this. The first paragraph is a little harsh. I think this is a very good article. I'm going out on a limb and say this.
77,76,">the CDC isn't ""right to do what they want"" The article doesn't explain why he isn't a shaman. The author of the book says ""If the CDC weren't supposed to give out the vaccines, I wouldn't want to get sick."""
86,76,The article just came out. It sounds like the whole thing is wrong and isn't that interesting. That's what you're looking at.
88,76,"OP is not in a court and is not a lawyer, I'm sure that the guy is trying to sabotage the government, since he hasn't tried any of these in the past."
101,76,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
76,2,>Why is the president not allowed to have a restraining order?
76,6,Vaccination is the best way to stop the spread of AIDS. Please wear masks.
76,11,> Vaccination is the best way to stop the spread of AIDS.
76,18,>The only thing that makes the post seem like a joke. I’m going out on a limb and say this.
76,24,"They were called ""crowns of blood,"" they used to say to people that the government is slandering them and not using science, but it seems they are being fucked up."
76,26,Then don't cite the article or the article if there is a restraining order.
76,37,The guy that wrote the article cited the President as being a troll.
76,38,The issue is that the restraining order is the one which is being used for sabotage. The CDC is used as a sign that they are being misled.
76,46,">the restraining order isn't in effect. The president is trying to convince the government that he's not a troll, but as a troll to keep them from doing it."
76,54,I think you have more than enough to look up in the article.
76,58,"This is the first time I've heard something like this in my entire life, so I wanted to hear the truth."
76,62,You can't help the president. The president is trying to make the administration seem like a troll. The president is trying to make it clear that the most important thing to him is the problem.
76,72,You can't make a restraining order because it doesn't matter.
77,76,">I lost my first mask when I was a kid.'', 'Is there anything I can do to stop the spread of the virus?'', 'What a good idea. He was even a CIA agent. He did the same thing to my father.'', 'Is there anything I can do to stop the spread of the virus?''"
86,76,The president has already made the restraining order legal and is getting some relief for that.
88,76,"They are also referred to as ""semen"". It is known as ""semen"" and means ""semen"" and ""semen"". This is an ingenious term that's used to mean sexes and people with different kinds of skin and hair, as well as people with different skin and hair colours and hair and such."
101,76,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
76,2,"In my defense, this is a really funny, incredibly cliche article."
76,6,"Vaccination isn't just a joke, it's a serious health issue."
76,11,"Yes, I see why I should make sure a restraining order for me is in effect."
76,18,">They can make people fuck up the act, and even then they will just not know what the problem is.'"
76,24,"As a lone redditor, I understand your pain. Vaccination is a legitimate and legal way to stop the spread of a virus. It is also a legitimate way to stop the spread of a virus. It is the best way to stop the spread of a virus."
76,26,"""'Putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i ve done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things."""
76,37,"A lot of people are confused because the article is about a fucking guy trying to get a restraining order against the CDC, he is a scammer."
76,38,"The restraining order does not give you the right to know how to use it, but gives you the right to make any decision that you may make."
76,46,The president is trying to make them look bad for not taking a restraining order because he doesn't have the knowledge to make a restraining order.
76,54,I think I found out that a certain piece of material in this article may be about the President's attempt to stop the spread of AIDS and is being called a troll.
76,58,It's the first time in three weeks that I've heard a virus is a troll.
76,62,Vaccination is not the best way to stop the spread of AIDS. It is the best way to stop the spread of the virus.
76,72,"He can go into the public eye and make his point to everyone he meets, who they can't help themselves to, that he knows he can't even help, or that he has a chance to fuck himself."
77,76,It doesn't work if he doesn't give an interview. It's not the CDC.
86,76,There is no restraining order in the US if a government employee is forced into it. The only restraining order is to stop people from getting HIV infect. There is no restraining order to stop people from getting HIV.
88,76,It’s an ad hominem that is so funny that I can’t even even comprehend the idea of the phrase.
101,76,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
