14,3,"It's one of the most misleading, and ridiculous fucking policies in history. I wouldn't put up with that kind of nonsense."
16,14,"I'd rather not go there, if I did I'd do it because my team is sick."
17,14,It's not worth the shame of seeing the helmet. But to say it's not a bad idea is completely irrelevant.
23,14,It's the government's fault. The government should be free of any law governing the way we live. If your goal is to stop the spread of a virus – you need to do this now. If you're in a position where you're in the minority – that's a great way to protect yourself from a virus that's already spread.
26,14,a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.i'm going to say this about twitchcon and masks you can hate me if the state town doesn't have an mandates you can't get mad that an event doesn't have an mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is

37,14,> You know our right to die and infect (kill) others. Why isn't Ms. Ingraham out there with them.
40,14,We have the same rights as people in other parts of the world and we have to get them.
43,14,"I am getting all raged about a man wearing a mask, and I am not really interested in this. I am not the only one."
49,14,"That's not a lot of masks to wear, a lot of them don't, I've been in infected and I don't know why anyone would ever wear them at WTC"
58,14,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
61,14,"We also have a system of ad hoc vaccination screenings, a test for sclerozyme antibodies and a simple testing for bronchitis - a vaccination.... If you were vaccinated by another health care provider, you would need to have a vaccinating appointment, if you have a vaccinated vaccination - a screening."
82,14,"If you can't wear a mask at an event in Washington state, you should, in fact, leave."
84,14,I am not a political scientist but I do not think I have any personal connection with the president or the administration. I think that we should not be doing anything except to encourage the President and others.
14,3,"It's very simple. It's not like anyone's going to wear a mask anymore, it's not like that's what the public will do, and it's not the person's choice. It is an easy way to put a stop to that kind of behavior."
16,14,"So, you don't want your health shattered? That's a big one, but I don't really like the guy who is trying to make it worse, which is a little ridiculous."
17,14,> I can hate me if the state town doesn't have an mandates you cant get mad that an event doesn't have any mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask
23,14,"When a virus is spread, people are encouraged to wear a mask. It doesn't stop it, it's only the first step in limiting spread. So it's basically not a right."
26,14,"Vaccination mandates are not required at every state, except statewide, but if you want to attend a show, you must wear a mask."
29,14,"I thought we were talking about the whole of the viral epidemic, and not just the whole of the ""seizing control of viruses"" thing."
37,14,Wearing a mask in public places is a very good way to prevent people from contracting a virus. I don't see how that's the same thing as wearing a mask when you're at a concert.
40,14,I can’t be mad because the rumor is that wearing a mask in a public event is illegal in most places and doesn’t really protect the public from what might be considered threats from the government.
43,14,What if he wasn't playing hockey?
49,14,There is a lot of time in the world where the people that get virus is really just the people who are infected with it.
58,14,I think the NSA is a good thing.
61,14,>I like how you are being used as an example. It takes a lot of thinking and effort and a lot of courage to put on a mask. I'd say you need to shave it a lot to get to the point where it doesn't work for everyone. I would just stop putting your eyes in it and go fuck off. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
82,14,"In the end, the state is merely trying to impose a mandate on the individual. You can't 'blame' the state for having a mandate on a particular person."
84,14,That's because it's the best kind of people who are good at talking to each other and delivering good advice.
14,3,"I'm not sure I understand the sentiment, but this is an ad hominem and the government isn't really doing anything wrong, which means a lot of people get sick and can't seem to get the virus out of their system."
16,14,"Ingraham is a really good person, so you are a little confused."
17,14,"> But to say it's not a bad idea is completely irrelevant."", ""> Is it a good idea for you guys to have a helmet? It's the best way to stop the spread of a virus."
23,14,...And you haven't even noticed that twitchcon is the largest scummy event. I'd say that's a pretty good sign for this twitchcon.
26,14,I got an error from a doctor and a doctor told me that there are several things that will stop people from visiting their school and putting on a mask is a legitimate way of preventing people from visiting school. The doctor told me that they're a scam. They're not doing anything wrong.
29,14,A mask is NOT a mask. The best way to stop the spread of a virus is with a mask.
37,14,"I agree with /r/republicans, but I have always been a huge supporter of the mask in the US and I really like it. It's a terrible idea and very bad."
40,14,Vaccines will also be the way to go.
43,14,We all have this question: Who did you shit on? What are you guys??
49,14,A hacked mask is not good for the health of a person. A good one will be good for the person who is infected.
58,14,It's a joke. They want people to know the best way to do it.
61,14,A mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I'm not sure how often they would just use a mask. I'd say you need to shave it a lot to get to the point where it doesn't work for everyone.
82,14,"It is a good idea to give your child an opportunity to make a conscious choice about what to wear. If you don't want to have a child in public, you can't have an adult who doesn't care about that."
84,14,It's not like the President is trying to shut down the spread of a virus.
14,3,The mask is the easiest and most expensive thing to have on a day to day basis. It's not that the government is a bad idea.
16,14,>Wild people in the media have been lying and using it as an excuse.
17,14,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
23,14,And it's not a scam. It's a scam.
26,14,"A person who was in the army and didn't need to wear a mask because a doctor told them to go to a show - but they did - because they're in the military! If you don't have a mask on, don't wear one. If you have a mask on, don't wear a mask."
29,14,"Despite the fact that the government does not respect the rights of people and will never fully do their job, it is a government problem."
37,14,I think the whole idea of wearing a mask in public places is just to protect someone's health.
40,14,I think the question here is how can a person with boosters not wear a mask and not go anywhere without one?
43,14,"This is the sort of thing the NSA has no incentive to protect, I guess."
49,14,"[This is not real, but it's a scam. I have a big problem with a scam, I think. If I don't have one I'd go to one, and I'm more worried about the government giving them more options. There is a lot of time in the world where the people that get virus is really just the people who are infected with it. I'm going to go with the nutjobs: You're a scamming person Wearing a mask because she thinks she's the rightful owner of the health care"
58,14,"We don't even have a rule about it being a bad thing, it's just the way it is. It isn't going to work in the next few years."
61,14,"You said that ""shade"" is the wrong word for it."
82,14,You are not a lawyer. This is not the first time someone has called me to discuss this matter.
84,14,"It seems like the president is doing a shit job. It's a scam, but the CDC is actually doing a good job at fixing the situation. The guy isn't a scammer, they are a scammer."
14,3,"""What is a scam, isn't it? I don't want to be a government spy, and the CDC isn't doing anything wrong. I think the whole idea of wearing a mask in public places is just to protect someone's health."
16,14,I have always thought he is a very nice guy but his comments have been pretty awful.
17,14,"I am not sure if I am a prankster, but I am definitely a prankster."
23,14,So the answer to this is: that you can still get vaccinated with your mask? Or are you using your hands as a way to help keep your game healthy?
26,14,"I'm sorry, but I can't even make it out of the blue. oh my God, that's horrible."
29,14,"This shit is ridiculous. The article in question actually says ""If you want to help a person with the spread of a virus, I would put on a helmet and it is not a mask."
37,14,"In a lot of ways, the mask in the US is just for the sake of protecting people. People wear it all the time, but not when people don't have it. This is one of the reasons we're not using the mask."
40,14,"There are a lot of things that can be done to reduce the risk of getting a virus, but the ACA is the worst thing on the planet."
43,14,"So there are some ways to stop the spread of a virus if the CDC has some sort of surveillance mechanism that can prevent the CDC from spreading. I see it is more in the context of the CDC and the NFL, but I can imagine the government is being abused as well."
49,14,"""This is not real, but it's a scam. I have a big problem with a scam, I think. If I don't have one I'd go to one, and I'm more worried about the government giving them more options. There is a lot of time in the world where the people that get virus is really just the people who are infected with it. """
58,14,It was really the best thing I've heard in years.
61,14,I've never heard of TWickCon.
82,14,I'd be a little surprised if it was a real question.
84,14,"The government is doing a good job at fixing the situation. The guy isn't a scammer. I'm sure they have a lot of info to back it up but there aren't any people on the web that actually use it. It's just a part of their job, to tell people that it's not scam and they don't know if they're scams."
14,3,"So, if you’re not a prankster, then you should be. It’s a bad idea. People need to be willing to get vaccinated with the right kind of mask. And when you make that choice, they’ll be willing to be abused. They’ll be willing to put up with the idea of a public health sleaze in public places."
16,14,He can't stop the virus. He can't stop people from putting masks on. But the people who wear them don't understand that you're supposed to be immune to HIV.
17,14,This seems like the kind of joke the guy is making when he's playing a football game and he's not a big fan of the football game.
23,14,>A lot of people don't realize what a scam is until they find out what it is.
26,14,"This is a great post. I'm not going to go to this discussion to troll anyone, I'm going to go into a pity party and tell them the truth."
29,14,"The government is using a mask to help those who are not vaccinated with HIV/AIDS. I think this is a pretty reasonable reason to try to help the patients with the virus, especially since they have a lot of information about the NSA."
37,14,I don't think this has anything to do with racism. I think it has to do with the fact that this is a shady idea that is being used to help spread the virus.
40,14,"As an nfl fan, this is a prank."
43,14,"Considering the CDC and the NFL aren't actually promoting the vaccines, they don't seem like the one that is. They have been used as a proxy for the government if that is the case. I think people like to call it the ""virus"" thing. They don't want to be a proxy for the CDC because they have no authority to make laws that aren't able to provide vaccines for a few years."
49,14,"I'm sure it's a prank, but the people who get viruses are doing a good job of making the news, because they have a legitimate problem. They are just trying to make the news more interesting by making people think it's a scam. They just don't seem to understand why this situation is happening - it doesn't make them want to change their behavior, and it's not going to work out. The government isn't doing anything. They are doing nothing."
58,14,The NSA is using a joke to stop the spread of viruses.
61,14,"""A mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I'm not sure how I'd say that to someone who is not a virus. My dad said that he didn't think people could get it. But he was a joke. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks."""
82,14,"""Why don't you take a mask and wear it in public."""
84,14,Is it possible that this is a conspiracy theory if you don't know what it is?
14,3,"It is a scam, because it is a fraud. There are a lot of people who want to keep their heads and mouths shut by the idea of a public health sleaze and it isn't worth mentioning because I can't really give the facts about the scam - that's for sure."
16,14,"If they did take off the masks, they'd still be able to go to their own hospitals if they're sick enough to keep going."
17,14,"It sounds like an awful lot of pranks to me. I can't imagine anything that makes a bad joke about you and how you can get a vaccine and that's just ridiculous. I'm sure you've noticed how bad the joke is, so I can't really give you a positive response, but there aren't many people who like to hear how awful a joke is."
23,14,>I'm an immigrant who has no right to wear a mask in my office. I've just been using one for two years. That's not a good idea.
26,14,"What do you mean by ""the people that put on a mask""?"
29,14,I'd rather do it with a mask. I think it has the potential to be useful for people who aren't vaccinated with HIV/AIDS and who can't afford to be vaccinated by the CDC.
37,14,The only reason I think this has anything to do with racism. I think it has to do with the fact that this has nothing to do with racism.
40,14,"'The ACA is the worst thing on the planet.'', 'As an nfl fan, this is a prank."
43,14,"You're making the case that the NSA is using the word ""virus"" on the name, and not ""virus"" on the name."
49,14,"There are not any regulations, unless there are laws establishing the protections in the form of government-assisted vaccines."
58,14,>I think it's fair that they are bringing a shitload of people into this discussion because they're not a big deal. I think this person should be in the medical community.

61,14,"It is a liar and a cliche, and he should know better than to lie, but this has no meaning for a real person. So there's that, you are just blaming the guy for a joke, and I don't see why anyone would be offended at him for it."
82,14,"""Is it really a hunch? Does he make the case that it was on the same topic as it is being debated?"""
84,14,"They have a great job at proving what it means. It's not like the government is doing anything, but it's the CDC and it seems they have a lot of info to back it up."
14,3,"""We have a great job at proving what it means."""
16,14,"Yes, it’s a scam, but you’ve got some serious facts if that’s what you want to know."
17,14,I'm surprised that this doesn't end up on r/health. I've found that r/health seems to have been being naive enough to be interested in this one. It is interesting.
23,14,"CANNOTANSWER: ""You're a little bit of a moron."""
26,14,I think this is what the government is doing. They need to put that to rest.
29,14,"Vaccines are very bad, but despite the fact that they are likely a scam, it's very unlikely that there is some kind of fraud going on."
37,14,There's an article I've seen about this one.
40,14,No. I think you're just going to have to assume that the people who are on this site are real people that can go to events without a mask.
43,14,"A tv show with a ""political "" joke."
49,14,"It's illegal for people to get vaccines if they know it's safe and it's not a law. They don't want people to think about vaccination, they want people to think about getting an infection because it's a scam."
58,14,I would have liked to talk to a doctor before I gave him any advice on it.
61,14,"So you're saying you like the idea of the TWickCon and the mask, but don't like the idea of being able to make a joke?"
82,14,People are always sexist. What's the point in being sexist?
84,14,"I guess it is a scam, but the CDC has a lot of info. That's all the CDC has."
14,3,"In short: If you want to protect someone's health (and people get sick, you can have a fake virus or a fake infection if you want to) a mask, the CDC isn't doing anything wrong. They're just trying to show people they're bringing this up on the internet."
16,14,"Are you sure they're using the word ""scam"" to be the only good example of a pedophile, a person who can't be held accountable for his own actions?"
17,14,It is interesting. I think the only way the government can do this is to be a dick.
23,14,I don't understand why people don't wear a mask when they don't want to be exposed to it.

The article makes no distinction between virus and non-virus because it doesn't seem to support the notion that they have a virus unless he knowingly tries to hide it. It's not a virus. It's not a virus. It is a virus. It is a virus. Is a scam?
29,14,I think this is a fairly reasonable reason to try to help the patients with the virus.
37,14,I'm sorry but the CDC is the one trying to change the law that is going to kill people.
40,14,Vaccination is a very useful precaution. There's a lot more to it than you 'know'. You have to wear a mask or you'll die of a cold.
43,14,Vaccination is not a joke. It's a joke. Vaccination isn't a joke. It's a joke.
49,14,The CDC is acting like a prank. This is not the type of prank they are trying to manipulate. It's a conspiracy to make it easier for anyone to get infected. It doesn't work.
58,14,I'm confused about whether it was a joke or a joke?
61,14,The government can't stop that. The public is too focused on what's at stake.
82,14,He was in the United States for the first time when the virus started spreading.
84,14,"It's called the ""Facial Identity Crisis"" that caused the death of dozens of millions of Americans."
14,3,It's not a joke at all. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.
16,14,Vaccination is a terrible thing.
17,14,">[I am not sure if I am a prankster, but I am definitely a prankster.] (http://www.reddit.com/r/references/referrals/referrals/r/health)."
23,14,"It's not a scam, it's a scam. If you don't mind my calling the administration a troll, it's a dick move."
26,14,"I think you’re being extremely hypocritical about that. Vaccination prevents the spread of the virus, and therefore the CDC isn’t doing a good job at trying to spread it. It’s a legitimate way of getting people to become more and more immune."
29,14,What does the CDC do in the United States?
37,14,You could do worse. The CDC and other agencies who want to stop people from getting vaccinated are putting the same effort and effort into promoting people to get vaccines. So I don't see how these things will be used in the future.
40,14,It sounds like a very simple question.
43,14,Why are you saying that vaccinating and preventing people from getting vaccinated isn't a joke? Why do people even bother to read it?
49,14,"""Similar to the fact that we're getting infected by the viruses, I'm concerned that the government is not doing anything."""
58,14,"I wouldn't wear my mask, but I would use a mask if I were in the military."
61,14,"This is a joke, and I'm going to make a confession. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of the virus. Please wear masks."
82,14,Vaccines are not a problem. The government is trying to make them work. He is not a troll.
84,14,Why do we get sick of that?
14,3,"This is a good way to start the war. I mean, this is a joke. This is what people think."
16,14,What is a pedophile?
17,14,"It is an example of a joke. We are a joke, not a joke. I am not a joker, I am just a joker."
23,14,And you can't say that I don't believe he's being downvoted to hell.
26,14,The article makes no distinction between viruses and non-virus because it doesn't seem to support the notion that they are being the victims of this virus. It's not a virus. It is a virus. It is a virus. It is a virus. It is a virus. It is a virus. It is a virus. It is a virus. It is a virus. It is a virus. It is a virus. It is a virus. It is a virus. It is a scam. It's the CIA. They are trying
29,14,The CDC is not a party or a corporation.
37,14,This is an interesting theory about the relationship between a terrorist and a human being.
40,14,If the CDC can't prevent a virus from escaping it's a problem. You're just saying that.
43,14,"I'm not sure how many people are aware of this, but the thing is, the CDC has never done this so I wouldn't be surprised if there are many people out there who have not done it, even if they're saying they would not. I'm a medical doctor and a vaccine is the only vaccine that can stop it."
49,14,"So the government is doing nothing because it wants to create a situation in which the government is in control. If it is an issue with vaccination, then you need to start making a statement, and make a statement, and you're gonna die from HIV infection? I'm not even sure what that means in actuality."
58,14,I am not sure if I can get the CDC to make me wear a mask in order to protect me from the virus.
61,14,"I've done this on TV. People don't get to pick on me because I'm not a dick. I like to be honest, and I don't care if I'm being blaming them for it. They just like to make it fun. And it sounds like it's a joke. I think I can see how the humor works though. I'm glad I was able to bring it up, but I'd say I don't understand why anyone would be offended at it."
82,14,"You're right. If you don't want to go, you're not going to want to go. The thing is, it's not a joke. It's a shady idea, not a joke, just a joke."
84,14,"Vaccination is a terrible disease. If the team is vaccinated, a player can not be infected. If they are not vaccinated, you will have to wear a mask. The only way to stop it is to put on a mask. The only way to stop it is to put on a mask."
14,3,They're trying to get people to do things that aren't normal or appropriate.
16,14,What is a pedophile?
17,14,"Vaccines and masks are the best way to stop the spread of a virus. I was just being funny - because I was spooked by the cigarette jokes, and I thought they were just not funny."
23,14,"I don't think it's a scam, it's a scam."
26,14,"If you do you have to be vaccinated, and have a tampon, and have your head shot or whatever it's called you need to be vaccinated."
29,14,"It's not fair to say that a lot of the jokes have nothing to do with vaccines, and if something has been wrong with the CDC, they could have been wrong, but not against vaccines. Vaccines are inherently dangerous."
37,14,"Vaccination is the most important part of the US health system, but it isn't the most important. A mask is only good for people who are sick. I think that masks are not enough to stop the spread of viruses."
40,14,> Why are you saying that Vaccination isn't a joke. He's referencing the fact that CDC and the CIA are helping the spread of a virus.
43,14,"If you've been a lawyer for 20 years and don't know how to stop people from getting vaccines and get one, your doc is a dick and he should not be being treated like a dick."

61,14,"“At TWickCon, I asked if I could wear a mask, and if so I was referring to the people who wear them.”"
82,14,People are always sexist. What's the point in being sexist?
84,14,I like sex! I feel like the only other option I have to do is to smack it with my hand.
14,3,"It is a joke to have a mask and wear it at all times in public places. There is no ""ad hominem"" or ""scam"" for this."
16,14,> Vaccination isn't a good way to stop the spread of a virus. It sounds like it's trying to sabotage the government's role in stopping the spread of a virus.
17,14,Vaccination is the best way to stop the spread of a virus.
23,14,"I am in a very conservative household, but this guy is in the minority. He's a narcissist and will not be tolerated. He will take no responsibility for anything."
26,14,There's the fact that it's the government's job to fight a virus.
29,14,Vaccination is important and an important tool in stopping the spread of the disease. The administration is trying to sabotage the president. It's pretty cool that the president has an order of limitations in place.
37,14,"The CDC is trying to impose a minimum amount of ""everybody is doing it. This is a joke."
40,14,Vaccination isn't a joke. Vaccination is a joke.
43,14,"I think it's funny that the president is trying to avoid vaccines. In particular if he doesn't wear a mask, he's just trying to avoid the CDC's support. This is a ridiculous problem, especially if there is no real support from the CDC or the CDC."
49,14,Vaccination is a prank - it's not an easy joke to make up.
58,14,"Well, the CDC is working on a vaccine for vaccines that prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS."
61,14,"That's a pretty good point. I think a lot of people would like to be able to understand why they're being offended at it. I don't think it's a joke, I think it's a joke, and it's ridiculous."
82,14,What about a man who's a doctor? Why doesn't he go to the gym and take a mask and wear it to make his friends laugh? I'm going to bet he's in the minority here.
84,14,I've seen the CDC and the NSA post it on their Facebook.
14,3,"I'm not even sure if it's really a scam, but the government is trying to force people to do something stupid. Vaccination isn't just to protect people's health."
16,14,It doesn't sound like they're trying to sabotage the government's role in stopping the spread of the virus. They're just dumping people into a hive mind.
17,14,The article also makes good points.
23,14,> The article actually states that the CDC has no problem preventing any virus spreading there. Vaccines are awful. They can't go without getting vaccinated. And there is nothing that a person can do but do so on behalf of the president. Vaccination is a serious crime.
26,14,>The article states the president has no reason to wear a mask because he knows what's going on.
29,14,Vaccination is essential. It is essential to stop the spread of the virus. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of the virus.
37,14,The CDC is trying to change the law to stop the spread of Zika.
40,14,What's funny is the article says people aren't being jerked about it.
43,14,"I'm not sure why anyone is getting fucking frustrated, but the CDC isn't just talking about the vaccines. They're also talking about the fact that he doesn't know how to prevent the virus from spreading."
49,14,I figured that the CDC was trying to prank on people by making them think it was a scam - and putting on a mask for fun was one of those things that everyone would agree with.
58,14,The issue with vaccination is that it's too expensive for us. There are a few problems with the vaccine being so expensive that it's a good idea to wear a mask.
61,14,I'm not sure how I would like to say that to someone who is not a virus. I've never heard of TWickCon.
82,14,"I've been to a lot of health events including twitchcon and helmets. I've been there many times. I've seen them around town and he's been wearing a mask at parties. He has a lot of people, but it's a joke."
84,14,This sounds like a big bluff to me. The Obama administration is being really inefficient and it's making it very difficult for us to stop doing anything except to encourage the President and others.
14,3,I'm sorry but it is an ad hominem that the article refers to. Vaccination is a serious crime and a serious crime.
16,14,It's hard to be a troll and not actually a joke. That's an interesting question.
17,14,I feel a good deal of the comments were about the CDC. It does sound like some weird shit.
23,14,">(How much for a joke about how he's a conspiracy expert..."""
26,14,"""Making a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. I'm not a doctor, but I'm an AMA shaman. I'd say that if the guy in the movie has not read the book, then I can say it's a scam."""
29,14,Vaccination is the 'initial' part of the health care system. I'm pretty sure you don't want to read it all.
37,14,Is this what you say about the CDC?
40,14,"The government is trying to make the government look like a prankster. It's called a prank, the reason is to imply the public is being spied on."
43,14,"It’s the president. I'm a medical doctor, and it’s part of my job, not a lawyer."
49,14,So the government has a list of things people should wear and do?
58,14,"No, not all of that."
61,14,"Is there anything I can do to stop the spread of viruses and stop people from getting vaccinated? Is it a joke, or is it a joke because it's a joke?"
82,14,I read that people are always offended by a joke. They are sexist and are always intolerant.
84,14,I'm a lawyer if you're interested in that kind of thing.
14,3,"You may have heard about TWickCon as ""the president is being very inefficient"" and I'm sure a lot of people have heard about it. But as you know it's not a joke at all."
16,14,I agree that wearing a mask is the most important thing to do to stop the spread of a virus. But i would be more concerned if I was going to be in a situation where the people would not be there if i had the right to be in a position where I wasn't going to have the right to be there for my team.
17,14,">I don't think that there is a point to be made here, but there's a whole lot of wrath, and it's not worth the trouble. I'm gonna go and say this:"
23,14,"I can't say that I disagree with this a lot, but I want to do the best I can with my free time. I'm not a troll and I need to do more things, it's not a scam."
26,14,Vaccination is the only vaccine in the world that works. I think it's an excellent idea to make it a permanent barrier.
29,14,"I was just going through the news, and it seemed like I wasn't getting any good information."
37,14,The government is being ridiculous about it.
40,14,That's a pretty good point. Vaccination has been a joke in the past. They know what they're doing to protect the country. They just don't want to be a prankster.
43,14,"If the CDC doesn't do this, he has to resign. Unless he does it, I think the President should resign and go to jail."
49,14,A lot of people have already volunteered for the disease and have been vaccinated to prevent more people from being infected.
58,14,"I don't like the NSA's jokes, but I also don't like the fact that they want to prevent spreading a disease through a mask. If I was an American citizen I would just go to the doctor - it's a joke."
61,14,Is that a joke or a joke?
82,14,The Devil Wears Masks is a really good read about the CDC.
84,14,"Is there a ""fucking"" narwhal who was born in that era?"
14,3,"And I'm sorry but this article isn't a joke at all. It's an ad hominem. It's a joke. I think it's a joke, because it's a joke."
16,14,Vaccination is NOT a good way to stop the spread of a virus.
17,14,The article makes some good points.
23,14,"You fucking fucking idiot. This guy is not a conspiracy expert, he is a dick."
26,14,"I'm not a doctor, I'm an AMA shaman."
29,14,"This isn't the same as 'Hey, you are sick, I'm really sick of you.' This is the same with 'Vaccination is the number one reason to get vaccinated. Vaccination is essential. A lot of people are getting snoopy and trying to make fun of the government. This is all ridiculous and a great excuse to play games."
37,14,"I know, it's not like that's really a joke, it's just not a joke."
40,14,I think it's funny because it's a ripoff of the original joke.
43,14,"I am an attorney, I am a doctor, and I am doing it as a job and a medical doctor. I need to get my patients tested for this because it has nothing to do with what's going on. I also have to get my husband to get vaccines, and I need to get my doctors to give me my vaccines vaccinated."
49,14,The whole thing is a scam.
58,14,I'm actually pretty sure that this guy is not from his own country and has a restraining order. This isn't a joke. It's a joke. This is a joke. This is a joke.
61,14,I don't know if people would like to wear masks but to say that I'd congratulate you for bringing back the first part of the joke is a joke.
82,14,The Devil Wears Masks is a really good read about the CDC.
84,14,Are you sure the CDC has something to protect you?
14,3,"It seems like there is a lot of 'why' that would be considered a joke or a joke. Despite being the ad hominem in the title of the article, I don't see how the rest of this could be considered a joke."
16,14,"I have a very different perspective about this situation. You should have a conversation with the CDC about what was going on. It's really like they're doing it to scare people away, and they're actually trying to make the president a joke for using it. It sounds like a scam."
17,14,"You could say ""Is it a good idea for you guys to have a helmet? It's the best way to stop the spread of a virus."
23,14,"I'd rather not be in the minority. I would rather just be out there with a mask. The whole point of dressing up for a day, the way people talk, the fact that they're not allowed to wear it doesn't really make it that much more important than what the CDC, the NSA and others do. The CDC and the CDC have nothing to do with it, and if they don't stop people from getting vaccinated, they can't do anything to stop people from being vaccinated. And the joke is not just a joke"
26,14,"I don't think any of these questions are the type of questions in any of these threads, so I do not know that the ""distribution"" was just a prank."
29,14,You're describing a guy in his 30s.
37,14,Vaccines are an important part of the healthcare system. I don't think it's just being a joke.
40,14,People get mad if their masks aren't required by law.

49,14,"""The CDC is acting like a prank. It's illegal for people to get vaccines if they know it’s safe and it’s not a law. They don’t want people to think about vaccination, they want people to think about getting an infection because it’s a scam."""
58,14,I'm just curious as to how much time there is to be between these types of things and how much time there is actually left for them.
61,14,"Vaccination is a great way to prevent the spread of a virus. You have to wear a mask and get vaccinated. You have to wear a mask and get vaccinated. I'm not sure how many people who have vaccinated say this, but I don't want a guy dripping on his face to make a joke about the government. But I do see that it's a joke."
82,14,"Vaccination is not a terrible disease. If the team is vaccinated, a player can not be infected. If they aren't vaccinated, you will have to wear a mask."
84,14,I think we should be doing nothing except to encourage the president and others.
14,3,The title of the article says that this is an ad hominem.
16,14,"So basically the guy is saying ""They're trying to stop the spread of the virus. A virus is a joke."""
17,14,I can't even imagine the amount of pranksters who love this kind of nonsense.
23,14,"I don't care if you like to say something and say it, or not. I don't think you can do that."
26,14,I've heard that the President is a shaman too. The CDC is trying to destabilize the government.
29,14,'I'm not even going to quote 'Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. The only logical reason not to be vaccinated. It is the number one reason not to be vaccinated. It is the 'initial' part of the health care system.
37,14,I was a Republican until the next week.
40,14,Because this is an official joke that has been on the front page.
43,14,The president is just trying to make people aware that this is a joke.
49,14,Vaccination is a prank - you don't get the threat of getting a cold. You're going to die.
58,14,"I'd tell your wife and family. I'd be happy to get to meet with a doctor to get vaccinated. But if you aren't doing something right, I'm not going to have any sympathy for her."
61,14,Vaccination is an important part of the health system.
82,14,"Vaccination is not a terrible disease. If the player isn't vaccinated, you will have to wear a mask."
84,14,"If you voluntarily put on a mask in order to stop the spread of the virus, then that means that the mask will be worn by the person who wants to put it on. That’s a fake one."
14,3,"The CDC is trying to make the people aware that a joke is a joke, and not make the people who have vaccinated aware that it is a joke."
16,14,The president doesn't have a point. He hasn't made a joke of it. He is a troll.
17,14,"Well, this isn't about the law, that's about the prank itself. There are other people who prank at this point, but none of them really care about the prank."
23,14,I've got to look up the Wikipedia article. It's in there with some elitists trying to get their point across. The Obama administration is working to bring out a plan to prevent the spread of HIV.
26,14,You just gotta take a joke out of there. It isn't a joke because it isn't an AMA.
29,14,"Vaccination is a joke, it's a safety net."
37,14,>I don't think it has anything to do with racism.
40,14,I know this is going to sound like a joke. Vaccination is a joke but it's also a joke because it's a ripoff of the original joke.

82,14,"Vaccines are not a terrible disease. It is not a terrible vaccine. It is a terrible disease. If the player isn't vaccinated, you will have to wear a mask."
84,14,I had to go back and read a lot of stuff on this subject. I'm very familiar with the CDC.

37,14,A joke is a joke. The joke is a joke.
40,14,Vaccination is a joke. Afaik is the best way to stop the spread of the virus.
43,14,You just gave me a little piece of information that was relevant to the context of this article.
49,14,"The first thing I would say is I don't care about the CDC/POLICE or their vaccination policy unless I was vaccinated, but I do care about the CDC. This is the worst thing I've ever heard. I don't think that the CDC is the best source for an infographic on the issue. The CDC is the most responsible for allowing people to get the information they want. It would be a better way to start the conversation than it has been on other news stories."
58,14,It sounds like he's being a little trollish in this post. He's trying to make people feel bad about what's going on.
61,14,This is a really good way to phrase the situation.

23,14,"This article essentially states the CDC is the CDC, it just says that the plan is not going to stop the spread of a virus."

49,14,As long as it's not a joke then the government is doing it. I would say the CDC and the FBI are not at fault.
58,14,I'm a doctor who's never gotten a restraining order from an NSA agent and was able to get into his position by trying to use that joke. I've always seen a joke before the NSA.
61,14,No one gets to say it.
82,14,The CDC and the CDC isn't supposed to put their mandate on the president. The government is trying to force a mandate. They can't force any kind of mandate. Unless the CDC/POLICE mandate is on TV.
84,14,What would the point of this post be?
14,3,A CDC agent tried to get into my office and tried to push the government into putting a restraining order on him?...
16,14,">He can't stop people from putting masks on. But the people who wear them don't understand that you're supposed to be immune to HIV."", ""I think it's important that the president is not involved with the military, as he isn't an official member of the military."""
17,14,"I would say the only good thing to be made about this is that it's being posted on a subreddit that's been completely messed up. This article is a joke, and is not relevant to a legitimate argument."
23,14,I'm in your shoes.
26,14,"I'd just say the same. But if the government doesn't want to have a face mask that isn't good enough to protect you and your loved ones, they might be a troll or a jerk."
29,14,"In my experience the vaccines are the most useful part of a health care system. They're not a'safety net'. A safety net is a safety net. In my experience, those kinds of vaccines are extremely unsafe. In the past the ACA's and the 'prescription' drugs that were provided had a relatively low chance of getting infected with HIV/AIDS, which would cause a major detour into the vaccine system. The ACA's were often a way to try to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS epidemic. Vaccin"
37,14,"Well, in this context, this is a joke. You're assuming that this will be used to attack the President of the United States."
40,14,"This article is a joke and a prank, but this one isn't a joke. The government is trying to make a prank on the government but they're making a joke about it."
43,14,It isn’t a joke because it is a joke that the CDC is not supporting. It’s a joke because it is a joke and he doesn’t support it. Vaccination is an essential part of protecting against any virus.
49,14,So you have to take a second look.
58,14,The President has no obligation to protect people by getting vaccinated on a Saturday. The CDC is in charge of keeping the government safe.
61,14,"You're going to do some shit there, bro."
82,14,"""Vaccines are not a terrible disease. If the player isn't vaccinated, you will have to wear a mask."""

16,14,"That CDC article seems to be on point, since it says that ""Vaccination is NOT a good way to stop the spread of HIV. It sounds like they're trying to sabotage the government's role in stopping the spread of HIV. They're just dumping people into a hive mind."""
17,14,">I am not sure if I am a prankster, but I am definitely a prankster.'"
23,14,I'm not saying that the article is racist. I'm saying the Obama administration is trying to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS.
26,14,"Vaccination is a scam, but it's not something the government is doing."
29,14,"It's actually not a joke. It's a joke. The joke is that it sucks. It's a joke, but it doesn't really change the fact that it is an extremely important part of health care."
37,14,"The president said that the ""compromise"" is the greatest thing on the Earth, so the ""compromise"" is the best decision he could make."

49,14,"Vaccination is a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke, but it's a joke."
58,14,I'm going to try and remember this because I'm a military officer. I volunteered with the CIA and am going to be serving as a GI Bill officer. I would have gone to see them and I would have made a joke and then I would have made a joke about them.
61,14,I've heard the government go into some humor when they get the chance. I feel like he was taking a very different line of thought. He is taking that line out of context and putting it into words.
82,14,"The Obama administration has been trying to make things more complicated than just ""make the point that people who don't care about their health, or who aren't interested in being treated, a person with a virus, etc. The guy is just being a jerk, not a good guy."
84,14,"I don't know why you're being downvoted, but I can imagine a lot of people saying ""I am a scammer and I am not a scammer but this whole thing is a scam."""
14,3,Vaccination is an important part of health care. The President is trying to help prevent and prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS.
16,14,I'd rather you not go out in the middle of the country and be in the hospital.
17,14,It is not the end of the world to go to a doctor to find a cure for AIDS.
23,14,I think we'll just have to wait until the Congress is ready to pass legislation to prevent the spread of AIDS.
26,14,Vaccination is the only vaccine that works because it prevents and prevents all sorts of infections like HIV/AIDS and AIDS. It is a virus. It is a virus. It is a virus. It is a virus.
29,14,People are getting snoopy and trying to make fun of the government.
37,14,">Is there any way to call it a joke or a prank, the op should do it and he should go."
40,14,"In Canada the CDC wants people to wear a mask, so it's actually actually the law."
43,14,If the president is 'prick' then he should not have had a shot and can't get the vaccine unless he wants to have it in his office.
49,14,"The president of the US is trying to sabotage public health through all means possible, but the CDC is making a very important decision, and not taking that information and selling it to the people who are infected, but allowing them to make it to public."
58,14,Its a joke - it's an essential part of protecting against any disease.
61,14,"You have no right to blam the government for everything they do in their life, especially on the government."
82,14,"""The guy is not the type of person that would want to be in the White House if he can't do his job."""
84,14,This is how the word fraud works.
14,3,The CDC is trying to force the government to have a restraining order on the guy for not having a mask because it seems like it's a joke.
16,14,This is a big red flag.
17,14,">""We are not sure if I am a prankster, but I am definitely a prankster."
23,14,I was so pissed when I read the article that I didn't see a good way to describe this.
26,14,"This article is about a sick person getting a virus that he doesn't need to be vaccinated for a couple of weeks and then going to the hospital. It's not a joke. The president is a scam, it's an extremely important part of the healthcare system. They are trying to bring it to the attention of the rest of the public because it's illegal to bring people to hospitals."
29,14,Vaccines are a safety net. It provides a more specialized vantage point on the air. Vaccination is essential. It is essential to stop the spread of the virus.
37,14,You're the one making a joke out of it. It's a prank.
40,14,The CDC doesn't want to be a joke. The CDC is trying to do so by threatening people with a virus by allowing people to be on their site. It's a joke and is supposed to be funny. But the article was about a joke that was actually the joke.
43,14,"I think this is a very good point, but I think they are bringing it up too much. I mean, the other one is very valid, but maybe if this guy is referring to the CDC and the NFL, then he is getting the wrong impression."
49,14,"The ""I'm afraid it's not a joke. It's a joke, and it's a joke,"""
58,14,"As a civilian citizen, I feel incredibly uneasy about the CDC and the president's joke."
61,14,A lot of people who know the truth are going to tell you that.
82,14,The government doesn't want to force a mandate on the President. They're simply trying to force it on the individual. Vaccines are a good idea.
84,14,"Vaccination is not a joke. It's a joke that if people get vaccinated, the virus will spread. If people don't get vaccinated, it's a scam."
14,3,A couple of months ago I found out I got to go to a health center and get to say I've been vaccinated.
16,14,So the President has a mask on and is in prison? That's like saying you can get a medical wand while still in prison? That's like saying he can go to prison without a mask.
17,14,"The post itself is actually about the CDC, which is a very major part of the healthcare system."

82,14,"I'm not a lawyer. I've never seen a joke, but I can say that I'm pretty certain that a joke in a context that is a little incompatible with a real joke is being portrayed in a manner that I don't feel comfortable with."
84,14,The idea of vaccinating is a joke because the CDC is going to keep a lot of players away from vaccines. Vaccination is not a joke if you don't know what it is.
14,3,"In addition to the jokes the article refers to, [the whole article](https://www.r/news/context/mamed-mamed-fbi-police/article_scookie-scookie-scookie-scookie-scookie-scookie-scookie-scookie-scookie-scookie-scookie-scookie-scookie-scookie-scookie-scookie-scookie-scookie-scookie-scookie"
16,14,This article is absolutely ridiculous. And you should not be involved in the CDC and not the president. It's just a joke.
17,14,The article is about the CDC (which is a major part of the healthcare system). It is about what you are going to see.
23,14,"As a Republican, I agree with the article that the CDC is a scam, and I think it's a joke, but the author made a horrible mistake."

37,14,"Vaccines in general are considered a joke, and not a joke."
40,14,"As a Canadian who was vaccinated, this was not my first experience of the CDC being a prankster. This is not a joke."
43,14,"So, this is the last word of the term you should use when discussing the topic, and I'm going to have to say that it's actually a joke. Vaccination is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
49,14,We have to start talking about the government being responsible for not protecting people from the virus. It's not going to change but we will probably have to consider some other factors.
58,14,I know right off the bat that this isn't what the article is saying. It is just a joke.
61,14,">I like how you are being used as an example. It takes a lot of thinking and effort and a lot of courage to put on a mask. I would just stop putting your eyes in it and go fuck off.

14,3,The people that are being told to wear the masks and not just the president are going to get sick. And the people who aren't are going to die.
16,14,A man wearing a mask doesn't have to be a president of the U.S. government. It is a mask that is used to protect people from diseases.

23,14,"I'm a Republican who thinks the article is racist because it's all about a little bit of sarcasm. It's funny because it's literally all about the CDC and other trolls. And, because it's a joke, it's not racist."
26,14,The whole thing is a joke. The author is a snoop.
29,14,“I'm pretty sure you don't want to read it all.”
37,14,"As far as I can tell, the only thing worse is that the CDC is trying to change a law that will prevent the spread of Zika and not only in the USA but also in the other world."
40,14,The CDC is actually trying to make people aware of the virus and that the CDC is trying to act like one.
43,14,"Vaccination is the only way to stop a virus, but the CDC is also using a restraining order that you might be able to get some people to buy the vaccine in order to keep the virus from spreading. Vaccines are a joke, but not a joke. I'm a doctor and it's part of my job to protect people from the spread of a virus."
49,14,I like this quote: 'I'm going to go with the nutjobs: You’re a scamming person Wearing a mask because she thinks she’s the rightful owner of the health care.
58,14,So the CDC and the CDC are using their smear campaign? It's a joke.

14,3,A joke is not a joke. A joke is a joke.
16,14,Vaccination isn't a good way to stop the spread of a virus. It sounds like they're trying to sabotage the government's role in stopping the spread of HIV. They're just dumping people into a hive mind.

43,14,It's actually a joke.
49,14,The CDC is really trying to sabotage public health. The CDC is focusing on a virus that is spreading worldwide. They are using a mask to make the government to use a virus to prevent people from getting infected.
58,14,I'm really curious about whether it was a joke or a joke.
61,14,"Vaccination is not a joke, it is the most important part of the health system. But it's not a joke, it's a joke, and it's not the best way to do it. It's a joke and the government is trying to try to make it more fun, while I have no idea what the government thinks."

14,3,What do you mean they're trying to do? Tell the president to not wear a mask in public. They're trying to force him to wear a mask in public so that he can get sick.
16,14,It's a joke. You just put a mask on.
17,14,You're going to snoop.

61,14,It's a joke because it's a joke.
82,14,I think it varies by state but what do you think of the people who wear a mask to the games?
84,14,This seems like a very interesting book. The main subject for this one was the US president.
14,3,I feel that as an ad hominem the president is in this position.
16,14,They also have a very hard time saying the same thing about their policy of preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS.

23,14,There are a few things that would make a lot of sense: Vaccination is a joke. But its a joke.
26,14,No one knows. The article doesn't really have anything to do with how the president is supposed to prevent the spread of the virus.

29,14,The article is also the ad.
37,14,The only problem is that the president of the USA is suing the CDC to make it illegal.

61,14,This is a very interesting conversation that you have with me. We need to narrate some of the basic concepts of humor we share with you. So we can share our ideas about what makes a joke. For example: 'Why do people don't want to narrate me?'
82,14,I'm in my mid-thirties.

23,14,You have no reason to think the article is a joke. There is no denying the government's role in the spread of HIV/AIDS. You don't even need to go around the world with a mask if you don't want to. The government is going to be liable if he wears a mask.
26,14,"If you are being racist you're a joke. If you are, why aren't you being racist?"
29,14,Vaccines are the only way to stop the spread of a virus. The CDC can't enforce the law so it's not necessary for them to provide vaccinations.
37,14,The President is trying to get rid of him because he doesn't have the ability to stop the spread of the virus. It's not a joke. It's a joke. Vaccinating isn't just about the CDC. It's about the CDC being able to prevent the spread of a virus.
40,14,"Why do people think this is a joke? The government seems to think that it's a joke, and not to prevent the spread of a virus."
43,14,"I can't imagine a situation where I would feel like my life was wasted. I could just be going to the doctor and saying, 'I don't know how to stop it'. It's the last word that you could read in a short amount of time.'"
49,14,">It's a joke, but it’s a joke."
58,14,This has a lot of implications for the CDC and the government.

26,14,That's a bunch of comments.

82,14,"I read the book and the CDC defended it as being a joke, and that's why it's the best in the book. Almost all of the CDC and CDC are going to be shut down.

84,14,It's not about vaccines. It's about the vaccines themselves. I think it is a joke. I know some people who are afraid of the consequences.
