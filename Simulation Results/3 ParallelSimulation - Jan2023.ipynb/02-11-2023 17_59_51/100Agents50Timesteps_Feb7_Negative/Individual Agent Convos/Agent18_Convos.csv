60,18,"What if your team has been having a hard time breathing? You’re wearing a mask... I would have to make it my goal to see if the player wears a mask before they start to breathe. If it doesn’t work then it will just get worse, unless the guy is already smoking."

76,18,This is the kind of thing that is the most terrifying in a man's life. Taking off a mask when you're hungry is literally taking your life away.

75,18,What would you do with a vaccinated person who has a life insurance plan?
76,18,It sounds like a scam to me. They are using masks to protect themselves. They are the best thing to do to prevent people from being caught in a concussion.

22,18,I don't understand why people think people are scummy about getting vaccines. The government is in a position to stop spreading a virus and they don't want to pay attention to what 'right' means.
24,18,if this is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. You can't be in a room with someone like this. You just have to talk to a doctor about it. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
27,18,I wore a mask in high school. And it had to be in the gym. Those fucking things will have to be worn! It wasn't a bad idea to wear a mask. It was just not to put your head down.
32,18,"A few days ago, a football coach told me his son was going to get vaccinated and I told him he wasn't allergic, I got a cough. And so I had to get on his back and ask him if he is allergic or not. We were told we should get the flu vaccine before he can go to the hospital. So he told him that he has no allergy to cough or cough and has an autoimmune disorder. His wife has a chronic asthma disorder, and they are doing a small, yet not nearly as aggressively apologised,"

18,4,"I agree that there is a problem. And you're right to be concerned. The reason we don't have a health insurance policy is because of the government.

27,18,There's a new thread on reddit called 'I don't think I've ever seen a joke like that about wearing a mask.
32,18,"You don't like wearing a mask and you don't want to be a good player. But at least you're not getting an unlucky one. I would rather be a decent player, and avoid a game and not play the game, because I have an extremely healthy lifestyle."

38,18,"It's not just a joke, it's a fact. That's where it gets to be done."
50,18,"OP, your comment is too general. I sincerely hope you’re ok with me saying the nih needs to cut a restraining order to allow people to wear the mask that the nih doesn’t."
56,18,It doesn't sound like you want to be vaccinated if you want to get vaccinated.
60,18,This is the kind of shit you don't want to hear.
75,18,This is all the reason why people need a mask in their homes.
76,18,"When you're out on a job, you get an extra 30 minutes of sleep. I just don't understand it."

86,18,This is a great post. But don't be afraid to get your own personal opinion here.
90,18,So what if someone in the US puts on a mask and she can't die?
93,18,It's one of the laws that the NSA uses to prevent people from having sex in public. This is how the federal government works.
18,4,I fucking hate people that put on masks in public because they know their health insurance company is undercover.
18,7,"Basically, the people who say that they're not being protected by the NSA are the ones who are not allowed to wear their masks unless they were a government employee."
18,8,"Wearing a mask and they can't kill is a big deal. I have a health insurance policy and it is a tidbit about the government's use of a restraining order. The reason they do this is because they have to put people in the military or scouts to fight it, and as a result they're being cut off from the military."
22,18,People have gotten their masks because of a recent outbreak of flu.
24,18,I think a lot of people were using this quote as a way to give them false sense of safety. The point was that it makes it sound as though a lot of people were misinformed about the health of the players.
27,18,"So in my experience, it's more about the person being sexist and the people actually wearing masks than it is about people who want to stop being sexist."
32,18,>The NFL will make it hard for the CDC to force players to wear helmets and helmets to protect them.
35,18,"He is being very dishonest. So if you don't know the words to what it means, stop trying to fuck it up and have him come up with that nonsense."
38,18,This isn't the first time you've read a post about this.
50,18,"I know you're a very liberal guy, and this is true. The military needs to get control over how they handle the issue."
56,18,A lot of the government's actions in preventing this kind of stuff are a little weird.
60,18,I'm the one who is on the team - and the people who are in a team - have to wear masks.

90,18,It doesn't even sound like the troll is trying to stop the spread of a virus because he can't understand the difference between people who don't want to live their lives and who don't wear a mask. I was reading an article about a troll who did this.
93,18,"I think you mean that as a person who has sex with people who have sex with people who aren't entitled to it? Not necessarily as a person who has no right to it. It's not about the government, it's about the government's power to prevent people from having sex."
18,4,"I am a federal troll and I have a health insurance policy. It is called ""the Devil Wears a Mask"". I don't know what it means."
18,7,"I don't know. I'm not very far off from being a ""fuck a lot of people"" type of person."
18,8,The idea of wearing a mask to protect against a virus is a legitimate defense. You cannot be wrong or wrong. Your post is completely false. Is there anything in the article you know about what is being discussed in this thread about the NSA?
22,18,"I think they aren't a scam, and they don't know what they are doing. I just think that a little mask is enough to stop the spread of a virus and scummy people are afraid of the government."

27,18,"> Hey, I'm a criminal that's a criminal. You might be a little naive to think that you're a fraud, but that doesn't mean that your actions are inherently evil."
32,18,"I think it's a bit silly, but it's kind of funny, because I mean, it's a joke."
35,18,"This is not a joke, this is the ""I've seen it"" ad."
38,18,People who are uninvited are often infected by other viruses. That's why I'm not gonna put on a mask.
50,18,I thought I was the only one that thought this was the top comment.
56,18,I don't really know if the comment is funny but you aren't going to be very supportive.
60,18,"""Making it out of a scummy mask is actually a very simple thing, but you can't stop it,"" he says."
75,18,"'I think you're talking about the first part of the book, the one about the man with the mask. Is it the best way for people to get away from this terrible situation, and then have to go to the streets in a way that's convenient and reasonable, for their own safety?"
76,18,I don't think the first sentence was intended to be a joke.
85,18,This is a good one. I hope they'll be doing a movie about this and I really like Tim Curry.

18,4,I know a lot of the people that would be upset if it weren't the people wearing the mask.

18,8,> The idea of wearing a mask to protect against a virus is a legitimate defense. You cannot be wrong or wrong. Your post is completely false.
22,18,"ahhh...the real question here... is there a purpose for a mask if you can resuede that the government wants to stop spreading a virus, or is that the government doesn't want to pay attention to what 'right' means?"

32,18,This makes me want to think about the people who work for the CDC and the NFL.
35,18,"I think the point is that the ad doesn't go against the ad, and it does not go against the ad."
38,18,The CDC and the US government are promoting vaccines that are supposed to stop the spread of the virus. It’s not just a scam.
50,18,"You guys are talking about the military. It's a joke, it's not a joke. There's nothing wrong with the idea that people who are not wearing masks are being sick. This is a very popular joke."
56,18,A man with no problem with the NSA and a mask at least four times a day (if he is just as serious as a narcissist).

24,18,I don't think that the CDC is the real problem.
27,18,I don't believe that the NSA is trolling.
32,18,I don't like the idea of playing football unless you want to. But what about a hockey player? That's what I mean.
35,18,"It’s the same kind of ad I'm used to as an anti-viral ad, but not necessarily a scam."
38,18,"This isn't a joke, this is a joke, this is a joke. This is what you write."
50,18,A lot of people have said that they are in fact a part of the military and have not heard of it.
56,18,I think the guy is acting as though you're an idiot.
60,18,I would not do that. I'm just gonna go and buy a mask for the sane person. They probably have no idea how to help the person.
75,18,"I have a book, and I've watched it. It's called The Devil Wears a Mask."
76,18,"This is an important point. If the problem is not the person being asked to wear a mask, they need to speak to someone who has no idea about the threat."
85,18,The Devil Wears a Mask is a great book - and the best one in the whole world. I'm not sure if you can get a movie in print.

90,18,I don't know how a single troll would justify the use of a hat in public.
93,18,I think the story is kind of ridiculous. It seems like this post was a joke for the sake of bringing up a topic that is not even real.
18,4,I just came home from work to read an interesting piece in a newspaper. It's called the Devil Wears a Mask.
18,7,What would you consider a joke that isn't a joke?
18,8,No. What is going on in this thread? How does someone put on a mask to help a terrorist?
22,18,I don't know. I've been told this.
24,18,"I've heard it said as part of a ""common sense of safety"" comment, but not all of it."

24,18,"There are so many things that need to be addressed in the US - people need to realize that I don't think a lot of people who can speak to the US have read it. For example, if the US government had put a restraining order on a person in a coma while he was in the NFL, they would have not acted with such a contempt.

27,18,You're the one who lost the scummy mask and now is going to have to use it as a vaccinated mask? This makes no sense.
32,18,Is the person in your family a good person? I know the CDC has been able to get away with this for a very long time. The CDC has a very good record for implementing such legislation.
35,18,The idea of people getting vaccines is also just as dangerous as the idea of vaccines if you lose them.
38,18,The CDC is promoting vaccines. The CDC and the US government are promoting vaccines.

76,18,"The last paragraph is a bit misleading, but I didn't mean to imply that the president is a scammer."

86,18,"They're not the government. The US government is, indeed, one of the highest governing bodies in the world.

It's a very serious problem for all of us."

93,18,NSA and CIA suck at creating a lot of false information in this sub. It's not about the government. They have a'strong' anti-terrorism policy. The NSA is an NSA. The NSA is an independent agency. You can't force a government body to do something without permission.

[http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/fake-fake-virus.jpg](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/fake-fake-virus.jpg) I believe that the CIA is using a mask in public because of this joke.

22,18,This isn't a joke. It's a joke.

32,18,Yes. The CDC is trying to discredit AIDS. Is this a prank? If not then it is a joke.

86,18,"... but if someone is sick and has an infection, they need to get a mask."

24,18,I have to admit that I get all of these quotes from the CDC. I've also heard how the CDC is using a fake virus to spread the virus. There's nothing that's really funny about the CDC restraining order - essentially a joke that the CDC has been suing the government over.
27,18,I'd say that it is a joke.
32,18,"There was a joke where the CDC did a piece of shit aimed at the CDC, but that's not the point. Vaccines are a good way to prevent the spread of AIDS. There is a lot of shady shit that is the point that you can't help them. It's also about discrediting the government's efforts to prevent the spread of AIDS."
35,18,They're not doing anything for the money to prevent that. And it's not a joke because they don't know what to do. But the CDC is doing something to prevent that. They are just making a huge deal out of it. Vaccination is the way to go.

60,18,I do not think the CDC is getting the right response to their request. They don't have the right to change their policies on a topic which isn't a joke. They need to get rid of the government and the CIA.
75,18,"Vaccines aren't a joke. There's no cult like this, a lot of that information being given out to the media and the media a little too easily. A cgi/racial joke makes a big deal of the fact that a guy wants to get vaccinated? This is the cult of the racist cult that is trying to get a restraining order on the CDC. The cult is in charge of the cult and is not a joke. "
