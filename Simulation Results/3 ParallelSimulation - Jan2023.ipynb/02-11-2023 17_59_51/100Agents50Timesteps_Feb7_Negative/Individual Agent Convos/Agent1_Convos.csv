19,1,"I just want to add that this is an incredibly sensitive topic for another sub. What are you getting into? I mean, basically, the government wants to take away your rights as a vaccinated person to protect them from the spreading of an infectious disease. But it also means it's too important for you to go to an event and get the vaccinations because you have an infection and can't do that. I'm not sure where you got it from, but I'm not sure how that applies."

If you're in a position where you're in the minority – that's a great way to protect yourself from a virus that's already spread. We have our own rules, not just about masks and helmets.

73,1,So what's going on?
4,1,The question here is whether the government will reschedule its anti-viral propaganda program to stop the spread of a virus.
19,1,"People need to be able to tell where to get a vaccine and how to get a vaccine when they don't get the medicine they need. It would be a good idea to go to a doctor because there is a virus, but the problem is that the people who need vaccinated don't have those. That's where he gets a lot of information."

27,1,A mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
28,1,The article states that people wear a mask when they go out to play. The article states that people wear them properly under a helmet... Vaccination and the spread of AIDS are a great idea. I think the article is ridiculous to me. I think the only way a doctor could try to restraining her from wearing a mask is if they had to do a check on her. That would take a great deal of courage.
35,1,If you haven't tried to go back a few times in the last month or so you should. You have a VERY good idea what's going on.
46,1,I'd have the same problem with anyone who is in a position to do it with the NSA. It isn't about vaccinating the people. They are just being silly.
51,1,"Generally speaking it doesn't matter what it is. A CIA man would wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus. A CIA man would wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus. He would be infected if he were a human. The idea of wearing a mask is that you have to keep your nose from touching your face, and that the doctor will work with you to put it on."

But it does state that the government is ignoring minor rights. They are incompatible with what's being done to stop the spread of a virus."
62,1,">The problem is not the mask itself, it's a symptom of the virus. The problem is the vaccines and they will do whatever the government wants. Is it a good thing? Because the problem with the CDC is putting the people in it at risk. The issue is not the mask itself, it's a symptom of the virus.

28,1,The whole CDC/Users Against AIDS story was really nice to me.
35,1,This is a really interesting thing. I was just looking for a quick remark to make.
46,1,The anti-vaccination section is made up of things such as:
51,1,"The thing is, it doesn't make a joke. It doesn't imply that the government does, and that it's a joke that it has no business making a joke about the virus."
59,1,"This isn't a joke. 'That's a joke, and I don't think you're being racist."
62,1,The problem is the mask and it will do whatever the government wants.

It's the government's job to prevent that and if you don't get one and end up being sick, you'll end up getting sick, and that's where people who are really good at it come from. The idea that the government is being vague is laughable. But that's the joke."
4,1,The quote is from the article that says that a shaman doesn't wear a mask when he's sick.
19,1,"Vaccines are not legally mandated. They are not legal and it's not illegal, so it's not illegal. Vaccines are a condition that is a condition that is a vaccine that is not a vaccine. Vaccines are not just a condition, they aren't illegal in most states."
22,1,A lot of the jokes in this thread seem to point out that a CDC joke is a joke.
23,1,"I'm just pointing out that as a conservative in a minority, they may not have a problem with the government as a whole, they are a bunch of scumbags."
25,1,I'm sure that's a few people who can think of one thing that could be used against the president and it is not an actual joke.
27,1,I'm not joking.
28,1,It's not a joke.
35,1,">I've never heard of a government official saying ""Fuck me. What is this you think you can't do?"" (http://www.twitchcon.com/docs/twitchcon_mom_ad', 'Is he trying to be an idiot? I'm sorry, but we are getting the ""Posh Man"" joke."""
46,1,The only way to stop this is to put on a mask. It's a bad thing.

73,1,"I know this is a joke, but the first time I wore a mask at a game was seven years ago when I had my first hs. But I have seen people put it in my uniform as a joke. I still think it's a joke. I love the idea of making a mask that prevents the spread of a virus. A mask that prevents the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best thing to happen to the NFL."
4,1,What a joke! That's hilarious.
19,1,"I don't want to go into details but I feel that the best option is to get a 'Put the CDC on your lungs' and tell the people that don't want to get vaccinated on their own, or to put on a mask that's already on their lungs."
22,1,I've heard that in a few years back. Is that the one that the CDC and Snoopy discussed?
23,1,> The only sarcasm is that the president is 'troll' and not 'coward' or racist.

59,1,The NSA doesn't need to be involved with syphilis vaccinations. The CDC should be the first step in stopping that. The article is misleading. It doesn't state anything. The CDC is not responsible for the spread of AIDS.
62,1,"I like this sub, but the point of the post is that a government is going to sue him over his actions."
73,1,I think this is an obvious joke.
4,1,It's not a joke. It's a joke.
19,1,I have no idea what you are talking about.

25,1,"So, ""I'm not sure that I'll be in a political position for the rest of my life. Are you kidding?"
27,1,So I'm a little bit of a naive racist. But I do agree that it's a joke. But I still don't agree with it.
28,1,Vaccination is a joke because it is supposed to prevent the spread of a virus. It is the only way to stop the spread of a virus.
35,1,The CDC and the CIA are promoting vaccines that are supposed to stop the spread of a virus. But they're not in a position to know what to do about it. They're in no position to know what to do about it. They are not in a position to know what to do about it. They are on the receiving end of the problem.

62,1,"We can do what we want, but in the end they are just too far to let it go. Its like a whackjob."
73,1,I don't think that's a joke. The only reason you're being a joke is because the joke is making fun of the ACA.
4,1,"That’s a really good piece of information. I’ll be honest, it is a very interesting one. I would think a lot of people would probably read it, but that’s it. I think the problem isn’t the mask because it’s a joke. The article is a good one, but it’s wrong. It’s a joke. What about “The Devil Wears a Mask” is a joke that’s being oversimplified, I think it’s a joke. But it’s not a joke. In fact"
19,1,A hat and a mask don't make a difference.

62,1,It's like a whackjob - but the government wants to sue them because it's a joke and you can't do what you want. So what do you think a CDC doctor is going to do with what he's talking about?
73,1,I think the ACA will only be a joke in some contexts.
4,1,"I love putting on a mask, and not just a mask. Especially when I’m in that place."

73,1,I think the question is who is more'really good' at what they do?
4,1,"""The problem isn't the mask because it's a prank, it's the way you look at it. It just makes it less likely that people will continue to wear it."""
19,1,You are not the one making a joke about the CDC and you are making a joke about a joke about how CDC is trying to prevent the spread of a virus.
22,1,"It's a joke, not a joke."
23,1,i don't know if there's a rule that says there's no right to wear a mask in public offices but when a federal govt is trying to do it they can say that i've used a mask for a few years now because i hate having it on while im in the military
25,1,"You could take the question ""Do you think there are people who'd actually do something like that, but not get vaccinated?"" and get a doctor's recommendation for you and your health insurance, or just a doctor's recommendation to your doctor. I'd say that's a very strong answer."
27,1,The joke is a joke because it's not about the CDC or the CDC. But the CDC's promoting the spread of a virus has done little to prevent it. The problem is that the vaccine is a joke because a lot of things the CDC says about the AIDS epidemic aren't about the vaccine.

35,1,This is the best article to have all week.
46,1,"This isn't a joke, it's a joke, it's a prank. The ad's intended purpose is to scare people into believing it isn't a joke."
51,1,'Vaccination is important because it is an important part of the health system.
59,1,"The article does state that people are not allowed to have sex, and that it is not illegal. But the CDC isn't responsible for the spread of syphilis. The article says that, despite being an illegal organization, the CDC's mission is to stop the spread."
62,1,I don't know who the doctor is.
73,1,You're using jokes as a joke. You're using jokes as an excuse to tell the government to stop vaccinating people. The ACA was passed despite a lot of people claiming it was an illegal move to vaccinate people. It was slammed and not made to stop people from having to go to the doctor to get vaccinated.
4,1,>I feel like the only way I can give advice to someone is to take them to a hospital and tell them to get their throats checked and no to get any kind of virus.
19,1,I'm trying to be a little clearer.
22,1,"I had the same problem with the joke - I could eat a piece of cheese and put it on a picnic table. That was in response to the joke about ""scummy"" but I just had to cut out some of the bacon from it. Despite the fact that I can not wear a mask because I had an AIDS infection, there was nothing to eat. So I made it a joke about my mom and she has to keep doing it, it's a joke, but I can't think of the whole story."
23,1,"Vaccines are terrible. Vaccines are awful. They can't go without getting vaccinated. The whole reason I don't like to wear them is because of how stupid they sound. So, I'll go by your joke."
25,1,> In some ways the act is an attempt at discrediting the president who supposedly is trying to spread the virus.
27,1,Vaccination is not a joke. It's not a joke because they are trying to stop the spread of a virus.

35,1,>Is it not a scam. It's a scam. The article says that the CDC and the US government is promoting vaccines that are supposed to stop the spread of a virus.
46,1,You're not a racist. You're an asshole. You don't have an entitlement to know who the govt is and what the govt is.
51,1,"Vaccination is important, but I think the CDC is suing people for the cost of doing so."

62,1,I think we are going to see an argument for the purpose of our response: 'They're trying to sue the CDC for their mismanagement of the system.'
73,1,You're being a joke. You're trying to play a joke. But this isn't a joke.
4,1,"Its not about being a prank, it is about taking the best precautions for the CDC in order to keep their CDC from doing something evil."
19,1,I don't have any idea why this explains the humor.
22,1,Vaccination is a joke. Vaccination is a joke.
23,1,“I don’t think I can understand this shit. I think we can do better”
25,1,"I've been in a few instances where he's used the word ""joke"" as a reference. It's an attempt to discredit the president who is trying to spread the disease. This is an interesting fact. A troll is a person that actually believes in the government, but they are a terrorist organization. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of a virus."
27,1,Vaccination is an important part of the health system. Vaccination is a joke because it is a part of the health system. It is a joke because it is an important part of the health system.
28,1,"I don't want to be a racist. What's your point, and how do you come up with it?"
35,1,"It's a hive mind, and if you read that and have a few months to see what the government is trying to do, you should really consider yourself lucky to be in the country where the people who are vaccinated are still being educated on it."
46,1,"The CDC's mission is not to control everyone, but to help everyone get the most effective vaccines available. In reality, this is a pretty big joke."
51,1,No. The CDC is suing people for putting on their mask.
59,1,"I am a huge fan of the CDC, and this seems like an interesting story and I am gonna agree with you that it should be taken seriously. I also believe that the CDC is also responsible for a lot of things happening in these areas, including the spread of HIV/AIDS. I don't see how the CDC could be responsible for preventing this."
62,1,Then the government tries to get a lawsuit against the CDC.
73,1,No it's not a joke. It's a joke because it's illegal to take people to hospitals where it's illegal to handle that issue. The CDC can't do this.
4,1,"""The problem isn’t the mask because it’s a prank, it’s the way you look at it. It just makes it less likely that people will continue to wear it."", ""I’m pretty sure there are some serious ways in which masks work to prevent the spread of the virus, including putting them on people who aren’t immune to the virus and actually helping people fight the virus."","
19,1,I've been wondering how the government is using a falsehood to justify that ridiculous comment.
22,1,The joke is that there is no actual solution. Vaccination is a joke because it is not. They are trying to stop the spread of HIV.
23,1,"I'm so sorry, and this is not a very good post. Please read it again, OP!"
25,1,CANNOTANSWER NOW
27,1,"""Daniel: I'm going to be very careful here. If I get anything else you will get the CDC to help me."""
28,1,No. Vaccination is the only way to stop the spread of a virus. It is the only way to stop the spread of a virus. It's an essential part of a health care system.
35,1,"Vaccination is not a joke. The government has no role in preventing it. But they don't have the authority to stop it. They have no authority to stop it. The CDC wants to stop it. The only thing they want to stop is the ACA removed. The CDC is trying to stop it. If it's a joke, then it's a scam."
46,1,This is the joke of the day. You aren't going to see this anymore.
51,1,Vaccination is important because it is an important part of the health system. It isn't a joke. It's a joke. The CDC is suing people for the cost of doing so.
59,1,"CANNOTANSWER SAID THAT if it weren't for the CDC, that would be a cliche."
62,1,The devil wears a mask is just a joke about how dangerous the CDC is trying to make. That's why they're trying to sue them.
73,1,"I'm from Colorado and I've seen people do the ACA in the past, and I can honestly say they're not funny."
4,1,"The question is, ""What's the point of a joke. It’s a joke, it’s a joke, and it’s just a joke, it’s not a joke. They’re just trying to sabotage a troll."""
19,1,"The fact that you're on the wrong side of the issue and you're being irrational, and you're making it out of spite to yourself, makes me cringe. Honestly, it's not even about the vaccine, but it's about the virus."
22,1,The only real problem with using the CDC's information is that it's a joke.
23,1,"As a CDC employee, I don't believe the CDC is trying to make a joke that says the government is a troll because of its role in the spread of AIDS."
25,1,"Vaccination is the best way to stop the spread of a disease. You can't just take your mask off and stay in it. You can't let a guy have a virus, because it's a joke. It's a joke because of the government's mandate, not because it's the right thing to do. I know it's a joke, but I know it's a joke, because of what you said. I know it sounds naive, but it's a joke. That's what they are suing you"
27,1,The President's attitude in responding to his threats to the CDC is simply a ploy by the CDC to prevent any future outbreaks. The president is also actively trying to spread the problem of HIV/AIDS.
28,1,"A CDC article saying ""The only way to stop the spread of a virus. It is the only way to stop the spread of a virus."""
35,1,"If you want to talk about a scam, then I would have to explain it and the government would have to give you a sarcastic comment. Those words are the key words."
46,1,">""The only real reason to wear a mask is because it's a joke. The only real reason to wear a mask is because it’s a joke."""

59,1,“There is no reason to have the CDC take care of this.” (The CDC is the one who is recommending syphilis vaccines.)
62,1,"I don't think it's a joke, but it's a joke because it's used in the CDC's job, putting on a mask on a sick person, and using the mask on people with AIDS, or putting on a mask if they're not infected, aren't the best ways to stop the spread of the virus."
73,1,Vaccination is a joke because it's illegal to take people to hospitals where it's illegal to handle that issue. The CDC can't do this. Vaccination is a joke because it's illegal to take people to hospitals where it's illegal to handle that issue. The CDC can't do that.

22,1,The CDC has been accused of trying to discredit vaccination because they think that's how it works.
23,1,The author has an excellent explanation of what they are trying to do:
25,1,"I think they would be a bit more skeptical of this if you had a better reason. Vaccination is a joke and a joke, but they won't get over their problems. This is how it all ends, and it's not a joke and it is not legal."
27,1,Vaccination is an important part of the health system.
28,1,"""Wearing a mask as a health defense is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
35,1,">A few other things, the CDC is helping. It's not going to be a joke. The CDC is trying to stop it. The only thing they can get to the person who is doing it will be to sue them. Then the CDC and the NSA will do the same thing to stop the spread of the virus."
46,1,"The CDC has no legal authority to ban vaccines, which is the CDC's purpose. They can sue people for what they believe, and they can't. They can't have any authority over them, and the CDC can sue the CDC for their actions."
51,1,"I'm not really sure why you're being downvoted, but I'm sure that a lot of people are."
59,1,CANNOTANSWER: I'm a huge fan of the CDC.
62,1,I'm going to guess that the CDC's attempt to sue them for their inability to do anything wrong is just a prank. I'm going to guess that it's a joke.
73,1,"The ACA wasn't passed, but the idea that 'It's a joke' is a joke is ridiculous, I can't believe it was."
4,1,"AIDS and AIDS are not a joke, and I find it hilarious that they are so common in a lot of places."
19,1,Vaccination is a joke.
22,1,"It’s an actual joke, not a joke. Vaccination is a joke because they are not the source of many diseases, and they are being used by the government as the source of a lot of problems."
23,1,">We have our own rules, not just about masks and helmets. This is why it's so important that people understand the importance of the mask, and it's the government's fault."""
25,1,"You are a troll. Vaccination is not a joke, and it is not legal, but it is used to try to discredit the president who supposedly is trying to spread the disease."
27,1,This is a joke. The joke is a joke because it's a joke because it's intended to stop the spread of the virus. It's a joke because it's intended to stop the spread of the virus. It's a joke because it's intended to stop the spread of the virus. It's a joke because it's intended to stop the spread of the virus.
28,1,I think the article is a joke. It's a joke because it's illegal to take people to hospitals where it's illegal to handle it. The Obama administration seems to be trying to do its best to keep the virus in check.
35,1,"I don't think there's a good enough reason for the government to do anything. The CDC is not promoting vaccinations, they're just trying to make a joke."
46,1,No. The people I was reading about are making a joke out of the ad. The CDC is saying that a mask is necessary for keeping the people safe in your body.
51,1,It's a joke and an actual joke.
59,1,"This is a joke. You are being a troll. Don't want the doctor to take care of the issue, and it isn't an ""a joke"" issue."
62,1,"There is a resemblance to ""what the devil wears in a mask"" in the US — as if it means that the government is using a troll cdc to stop the spread of the virus."
73,1,"I would also like to point out that the first point I was making was, 'Oh, you're not being a joke'. I'm sure you're thinking of the NFL, where vaccination isn't a joke.'"
4,1,"In the USA we only have one vaccine: polio, and a few diseases are very common. We do not know what the CDC is trying to do with it or what it does with it. We know what it does with polio, but we don't know what it does with AIDS."
19,1,"This is just a joke, and the joke itself is a joke."
22,1,"Vaccination isn't the worst. And because it's not the CDC is trying to discredit it, it's not a joke. Vaccination is a joke because the CDC and the CDC are trying to sue him for this and he is trying to make it seem like a joke to them."
23,1,"I'm actually very happy with the idea of a better way to protect myself from HIV."""
25,1,"No, a joke isn't a joke. It isn't a joke. A joke isn't a joke."
27,1,"Then the problem is, you don't believe the CDC is trying to stop the spread of the virus?"
28,1,The CDC is suing CDC employees suing them for knowingly introducing a new medical technology to people who aren’t currently trained to be vaccinated for AIDS.
35,1,"No, the CDC does not want to change the ACA, so they are trying to be in charge of stopping it. That's not a joke."
46,1,I can't believe Obama has a huge support base in his support of vaccination.
51,1,I think this would be a pretty bad prank because it's not a joke.
