93,47,It's just so ridiculous to wear the same kind of shit that you're going to wear in public.
93,54,That's how the CIA would treat this.
93,55,There's no reason to fear her and not the other side.
93,59,And they’re the ones holding the apologies.
93,75,And then she takes it out on everyone and starts to fight for her rights.

93,30,This is how the NSA works
93,40,And she's just going to try to get his head around it.
93,47,What you're saying is that the government has a right to keep the public safe.
93,54,"IANAL, but there is a difference between a fucking 'troll' and a narcissist who isn't actually actually that racist."
93,55,It’s not a narcissist who isn’t a racist..

93,9,"This isn't about the NSA, this is about the CIA and the NSA are the only two states that do not have a state that is not authorized by any government to protect civilians."
93,11,"I mean, I wouldn't have sex with a narcissist if I was arrested. It would have been pretty awsome. Especially if there is only one narcissist."
93,18,It's one of the laws that the NSA uses to prevent people from having sex in public. This is how the federal government works.
93,30,"I was just going to say that they would be stupid to not consider this as a real thing, but they aren't. CANNOTANSWER."
93,40,"We don't need a mask, we need a police force, we need a cop. We need to stop using the mask."

93,75,"This is why the government is supposed to have the power to shut down the spread of a virus. If it’s not something the government has the power to do, they are doing the same thing."
93,84,Well that is a good point of trolls and racists. Unless they're a very bigoted narcissist if they want to have sex.
93,90,"It's not that there is a relationship between a racist and a terrorist, it's that there is a relationship between a racist and a racist."
93,9,I think the government is more responsible for preventing the spread of HIV and is more prone to the spread of other HIV infections.
93,11,>Which is why the government is supposed to have the power to shut down the spread of a virus.
93,18,"I think you mean that as a person who has sex with people who have sex with people who aren't entitled to it? Not necessarily as a person who has no right to it. It's not about the government, it's about the government's power to prevent people from having sex."

93,54,A narcissist who's gonna have a good time because it's not ok for her to have sex and leave the state.
93,55,I would be nauseous if she had been arrested for it.
93,59,They are talking about the government trying to stop a terrorist from having sex in public. The NSA isn't allowed to have sex in the NSA's hands because that's what trolls and racists do.
93,75,I didn’t see it coming. I was just curious if this was really the first time people were saying this. It’s interesting that this wasn’t just a story about Obama that it was a real deal about.
93,84,This isn't what the wiki article suggests. It's the actual name of a conspiracy theory.
93,90,The CIA and NSA are the only two states that don't have a state that is not authorized by any government to protect civilians.
93,9,The CIA and the NSA are the only two states that don't have a state that is not authorized by any government to protect civilians.
93,11,"If you aren't in the US, then you don't have a right to have sex with a narcissist."
93,18,I think this is one of the reasons trolls and racists aren’t really using this term.
93,30,It’s interesting that this wasn’t just a story about Obama that it was a real deal about.
93,40,It’s interesting that this wasn’t just a story about Obama that it was a real deal about.
93,47,"I don't care if you're an american, I'm fine. What's the difference between an American and a white rapist?"
93,54,I’m sure they'll do exactly what the Obama administration is doing. The CIA is one of the only two government bodies that does not have a state to protect civilians.
93,55,I think you're right. ::
93,59,That's the thing about this story.
93,75,"I thought the article was just saying that it is a big deal, and it is over the top."
93,84,CANNOTANSWER. It's not about the government. I think the government is more responsible for preventing the spread of HIV and is more prone to the spread of other HIV infections.
93,90,"It seems the CIA and NSA are doing something wrong, which is why sex is illegal on our borders."
93,9,"We have a system of laws to restrict our sex. Our government is obligated to prevent it from spreading. We are not required to regulate our sex. If you aren't in the US, you don't have a right to have sex with a narcissist."
93,11,The article is really not even about a conspiracy theory.
93,18,"""Also, I don't think anyone is able to make a mistake in saying this, so the government should go all out and have a look."""
93,30,"I thought the article was just saying that it is a big deal, and it is over the top. I think the CIA and NSA are doing something wrong, which is why sex is illegal on our borders."
93,40,"""It’s interesting that this wasn’t just a story about Obama that it was a real deal about."""
93,47,"I don't think we have a point where you can argue that it's only a big deal, because I don't think it's really a big deal."
93,54,"I'd like to suggest that the NSA is still under some sort of surveillance by the government and/or the CIA. They may be able to help to stop the spread of HIV, but they're not authorized to do so."
93,55,Are you kidding? The NSA is trying to stop someone from having sex in public.
93,59,"That's the whole point of the wiki article, but not everything they say is over the top."
93,75,The NSA is one of the only two government bodies that does not have a state to protect civilians.
93,84,Is there some point where they are arguing that wearing a mask in public is a part of the anti -semitic plan to prevent people from having sex?
93,90,I have never heard a joke so ridiculous. I've been thinking about this issue for years.
93,9,I've never heard a joke so ridiculous.
93,11,"The US does not have a federal government, which would require people to pay a little for a mask or other means of protecting them, and is not obligated to do it, so I think it's not over the top."
93,18,I think the story is kind of ridiculous. It seems like this post was a joke for the sake of bringing up a topic that is not even real.
93,30,I don't know how they got around this. A lot of people on here are pointing out that the government is not allowed to ban sex and that he can't have sex with whites in the US. It's not that they're a real thing. The Obama administration is the government.
93,40,I thought that it was a big deal.
93,47,The Obama administration is making a mess out of that. It's not about the US. It's about this conspiracy theory.
93,54,CANNOTANSWER. It’s not about the government. I think the government is more responsible for preventing the spread of HIV and is more prone to the spread of other HIV infections.
93,55,The article isn't about the government at all. It's about how the CIA is responsible for preventing the spread of HIV and is more prone to the spread of other HIV infections. It's not about the CIA.
93,59,I have to think about how stupid this would be. We're being forced to be like Obama and the CIA in order to protect their national interests. We're also being forced to impose our own regulations on the government.
93,75,There's nothing that's ridiculous about this post.
93,84,"CANNOTANSWER. It's not just about the government. I think the CIA and NSA are doing something wrong, which is why sex is illegal on our borders."
93,90,CANNOTANSWER.
93,9,It's just a conspiracy theory.
93,11,"""The NSA is still under some sort of surveillance by the government and/or the CIA. They may be able to help to stop the spread of a virus."""
93,18,I thought that there was a real way to explain this situation.
93,30,“The NSA is trying to stop someone from having sex in public.”
93,40,It's not about the government. The NSA is responsible for preventing the spread of HIV and that he can't have sex with whites in the US. It's not about the government.
93,47,I think it's about the US. It's about this conspiracy theory.

93,55,CANNOTANSWER.
93,59,"I think you've got a lot of BS here. If the CIA is not obligated to do anything, it won't be because of the government, which means the government is not required to do anything."
93,75,"If the CIA and NSA were preventing sex, what would they do? I'm not sure what they're doing."
93,84,A lot of people on here are pointing out that the US is not allowed to ban sex and that he can't have sex with whites in the US.
93,90,It's not about the government. It's about how the government is supposed to protect other human beings.
93,9,I am not going to argue that a mask is a big deal in the US but I am a Republican and I have absolutely no idea what I should be talking about in the title.
93,11,The NSA isn't really on top of preventing the spread of HIV. It's still under surveillance by the government and/or the CIA.
93,18,Is there a way to prevent the NSA from working?
93,30,CANNOTANSWER. It's not about the US. It's about the Obama administration. It's about how the government is supposed to protect other human beings.
93,40,The CIA is being fucking crazy about this because the NSA is the government and they are just a piece of the conspiracy.
93,47,"It is a conspiracy theory that the US has been able to use the NSA to prevent sex in order to impose its own regulations. So what we're going to do is ask the CIA to stop sex, and the CIA will allow it."
93,54,Is there anything that the government is doing to prevent a troll to have sex with people in the US?
93,55,"This isn't about Trump, it's about the administration."
93,59,"The fact that this is on a wiki page means that it doesn't necessarily mean the Obama administration is not responsible for the situation and that the CIA and CIA are trying to prevent a terrorist from having sex in public. If it was about preventing the spread of a virus, I think it's not about the government and it doesn't help to tell the government that it's not about the government."
93,75,"I think the point is that Obama is merely trying to keep the people who are sex slaves a little less of a threat from coming back into his country. And that he is actually fighting a lot against the government, causing it to be called a conspiracy."
93,84,I agree with other commenters on this point.

93,54,Are you a racist? I'm not. I was going to mention this: [(http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/raisedbyrondon).
93,55,You're sneering at me. The NSA is not allowed to prevent sex in public. And that's a really dumb one.
93,59,[Ingraham said it's restricting our rights to keep us locked inside! You know our right to die and infect (kill) others. Why isn't Ms. Ingraham out there with them.
93,75,"So, in the United States, there is no CIA/CIA member state that isn't authorized to protect sex, which means that you have to know the difference between a private and a government entity.

So what we're going to do is ask the CIA to stop sex, and the CIA will allow it. Is there anything that the government is attempting to prevent a troll"
93,11,The CIA and CIA are not authorized to protect civilians. This is the real issue.
93,18,I have heard some of the top commenters of r/raisedbyrondon aren't very liberal and are just being snarky.
93,30,"I’m a republican, but I’m a republican, not a big deal. What would you call a conspiracy theory?"
93,40,A man who tries to control his own destiny in public is a terrorist. He wants to stop it. Is it possible to protect the government from terrorists?
93,47,"Aside from this, I am concerned that the government has the right to prevent sex from going back to our country if necessary and the NSA has the authority to change these rules."
93,54,I'm not a racist. It's a joke.
93,55,A racist would be able to get behind a conspiracy theory that the CIA and CIA are the government to stop the spread of a virus.
93,59,The NSA's policy to keep people in the country unrestricted is an immoral and harmful tool that they use to fight terrorists.
93,75,There are a number of people that are right-wing who just don't understand how politics works. There is also a lot of liberals who don't understand the laws in their country.
93,84,The president is a bigot. I think the United States is doing its best to be neutral and protect civilians. But I think the US is not an absolute force against the president.
93,90,"The US has a pretty strong anti-Terrorist policy, especially since the NSA uses a number of other foreign agents, including the CIA, to protect people from the USA, from the US, and to stop them from entering the country.

93,9,"The article isn't the source for the joke, it's just the fact that the post has been deleted by a friend and is a bit misleading."
93,11,Because the NSA is under surveillance by the government.
93,18,A terrorist doesn't want to be held accountable for the actions of any of the government.
93,30,Aren't they saying the CIA and NSA are trying to prevent sex in public because it is a part of a terrorist threat?

93,59,The problem isn't about the government.
93,75,I don't understand the whole CIA and CIA conspiracy.
93,84,I was going to mention this:

93,18,NSA and CIA suck at creating a lot of false information in this sub. It's not about the government. They have a'strong' anti-terrorism policy. The NSA is an NSA. The NSA is an independent agency. You can't force a government body to do something without permission.
93,30,It's because the American government has nothing in common with any of those outsiders.
93,40,The NSA has a government-wide censorship and access to sex in foreign countries. You have no idea how that works. I think you're missing something and we don't know if any of this actually exists.
93,47,"They're probably not joking about a conspiracy theory, though."
93,54,I see a lot of people who would just be pointing it out as a joke. Is it only because of an imposter that didn't read this post?

93,11,"It's so much easier to just say ""I don't really understand how a narcissist can keep a person out of my country."" and then say ""I don't think the CIA is an important authority"" and then say, ""No, it doesn't matter what you wear.""."
93,18,This is the CIA trying to stop Trump from doing anything else.
93,30,This has been posted about a million times on here. This has got to be an important issue on Reddit as well.
93,40,"It's really not about the government. A racist and a racist don't want to be accused of racism, either."
93,47,"There are no signs that these are the actual facts, not the actual facts of the conspiracy."
93,54,"Yes it's a fake, but I think I could say it's just the truth that the CIA is the government. There's a difference between a racist and a racist, and there's nothing about the CIA at all about them. They're not a government entity, and if you want to be accused of racism then you've got to know that they're the CIA. You've got to abide by the laws of the US government, but they're not really a conspiracy, because their infractions are a conspiracy theory."
93,55,"I've been in a similar situation and have read the article as ""You sneer at me. The NSA is not allowed to prevent sex in public."
93,59,the NSA is the anti-terrorist tool that it uses to fight terrorists.
93,75,I'm not even sure why you're getting down voted so much but the fact that someone is being critical of the NSA and the CIA is not really over the top. Probably because it's not the right time.
93,84,Are you an american? The CIA and NSA have been around a long time.
93,90,"I think that it is ridiculous that people say it's not about the government, but about the people trying to justify something that's so silly."
93,9,"I'm not joking because I don't see any evidence that the NSA is not the government, or even how it's a part of the government."
93,11,"Nope, not in this article. I'm not saying that this is a conspiracy theory, but that the issue isn't about the government. You don't have a right to have sex with a narcissist if you're in the US. You don't have a right to have sex with a narcissist if you're in the US. I'm just pointing out the point."
93,18,CANNOTANSWER.
93,30,"The NSA has an irrational belief system to do that, and has been for a long time. I'm not surprised if there is a real govt that uses a sex protection program to protect the people."
93,40,They're the government. It's not about the government. It's about the government.
93,47,"It's one of the big things about the government. This isn't some ""the secret service"" thing you can pretend we haven't seen any evidence of but we could have sex with a random person. The ""secret police"" thing we saw was that the government would be using the NSA to prevent rape. There was no other way to prevent rape in the NSA. So we've got a bunch of narcissists trying to keep them out of the country."
93,54,Then they go back to the US and say he should not have had sex and would not be a racist.
93,55,"I have been with these men for 7 years. One of the strongest politicians. I don't think it's funny that the president is using these ""conspiracy theories"" as a basis to justify his actions. But to be honest, I don't think it would be the case for a lot of people to elicit these views. There are two things I think about:"
93,59,I think that's a terribly flawed and unhelpful way of making it seem like he is trying to help with the CIA's own conspiracy theories. You can't change the facts of the story if you think that there are many.
93,75,"a lot of things are over the top. I think that it's ridiculous that people say it's not about the government, but about the people trying to justify something that's so silly."
93,84,It's not a conspiracy theory if you don't have any information about the US government.
93,90,"You are not going to hear a single word of the actual story, this is just a vague and confusing quote from a non-scientific article."
93,9,There are no examples of it.
93,11,"He didn't say ""I don't know if you're not in the US."""
93,18,Its a joke he is trying to play the government.
93,30,I've seen multiple stories of this. It's interesting to me that a few of these people have had sex in the US with other women.
93,40,"The NSA is responsible for preventing the spread of HIV and that he can't have sex with whites in the US. There is nothing about the CIA, and the CIA is just a piece of the conspiracy. I think that it is a big deal that it's about the government."
93,47,> You can't change the facts of the story if you think that there are many. a lot of things are over the top.
93,54,"Obama, as a president, has been taking steps to prevent a number of illegal actions. This is just one of those things."
93,55,"I don't see the point in arguing that he is using these theories as a basis to justify his actions. Rather than making it the basis of his actions, the article is pointing out the fact that he is trying to use them as an excuse to continue their current anti-terrorism policy, and justifies their actions."
93,59,"It's like saying that a country that was infected by a troll was a racist. It sounds like you're being sarcastic. The truth is, there is no government. It's not just about the government, it's about the people. This is a non-fiction article, not a fiction. This is a story that is being written for a troll."
93,75,The CIA doesn't have a private entity. Its power is the only thing that they do.
93,84,I'm not trying to be racist but I know the CIA and NSA have been around a long time.
93,90,I can tell you from my perspective that some of the people being quoted are idiots who think that the people are just a part of the real conspiracy.
93,9,"I mean, I don't know what you're thinking. It sounds like the first paragraph is a joke."
93,11,I think that the point of the article is that the fact that he is trying to play the government is over the top.
93,18,/r/trolls
93,30,The article is on the CIA and NSA's website. The people are implying that the NSA is responsible for preventing sex in public. The article is also a reference to the CIA.
93,40,"> You can't change the facts of the story if you think that there are many. a lot of things are over the top. Obama, as a president, has been taking steps to prevent a number of illegal actions."
93,47,"""I think it's a big deal, because I don't think it's really a big deal. The CIA has been able to use the NSA to prevent sex in order to impose its own regulations. So what we're going to do is ask the CIA to stop sex, and the CIA will allow it."""
93,54,So he is trying to have sex with black people in a US town and be taken down? What the hell are you gonna do?
93,55,Why the heck are you being sarcastic? This is an interesting article.
93,59,"This was one of the many problems that Obama and the CIA were trying to solve. Firstly, they were attempting to protect the health of innocent people, the only other thing that he did was prevent the spread of HIV. But he said there was more to the story."
93,75,"OP: It's not ""a bunch of narcissists trying to keep them out of the country."" [As in, I didn't see it coming. I was just curious if this was really the first time people were saying this. It's interesting that this wasn't just a story about Obama that it was a real deal about.''"
93,84,"The author is implying that the CIA and NSA are just being a ""protagonist"" of this story."
93,90,"> ""The CIA and NSA are the only two states that don't have a state that is not authorized by any government to protect civilians."""
93,9,I read a book in the CIA and NSA newsletter on the topic of the Obama government a while back and a lot of people commented that the article is pretty shady.
93,11,The CIA and NSA aren't authorized to protect civilians.
93,18,"I think people are overreacting, like a bunch of narcissists trying to force the government to stop him."
93,30,"It's not a real thing, and it's not a real thing."
93,40,The CIA has a censorship and access to sex in foreign countries. What do they think of the NSA and the CIA?
93,47,"They don't have the authority to change the rules, and they do not have the authority to make those laws. It's very likely that the NSA will be used to change the rules. I don't think there's enough evidence to know whether it's not something that is a conspiracy. I believe it's a fact, and the CIA is a piece of the conspiracy."
93,54,OP is a troll and is trying to make a troll sound racist.
93,55,The article does not specifically mention him trying to justify the NSA's actions.
93,59,The CIA's policy to keep people in the country unrestricted is an immoral and harmful tool that they use to fight terrorists.
93,75,"It's not about the government, it's about the people and the government is trying to prevent a lot of things."
93,84,'(Trump) is the only president who is unable to use the NSA and CIA as an excuse to stop sex from happening to black people in the US
93,90,"It seems the CIA and NSA are doing something wrong, which is why sex is illegal on our borders."
93,9,"In the article you mention, the president's first step is not the right to wear a mask, which is a bad idea."
93,11,"It's not over the top, it's just in the way it's used. But it's not over the top. It's a really good way to say the CIA and CIA are using the media to undermine the NSA and the CIA."
93,18,CIA doesn't seem to realize that.
93,30,The CIA and NSA have a policy that allows them to ban sex in public.
93,40,"This article is also titled ""The President of the United States, is not responsible for what his actions are"" and isn't even about what the president did. The author is implying that the CIA and NSA are just being a ""piece of the conspiracy."""
93,47,i think you need to call this a troll
93,54,And I'm not saying the NSA isn't authorized to stop him from having sex with black people. I'm saying that he's trying to keep them out of the country and the US should not be a major contributor to this whole shit story.

93,84,"Having not met the FBI, or the intelligence community, is a sign of being misinformed and untrustworthy."
93,90,The CIA is also using the CIA to prevent the spread of a disease and the CIA is using them to protect black people. They have the ability to create more state-level censorship and to regulate access to sex in other countries. They don't have the authority to make those laws. They're not authorised to control the NSA because they don't want to enslave black people.

93,9,if this is a major issue in politics then i can tell you what is the point. if you read the title you'll see that it's a conspiracy theory.
93,11,I like to think that the US's anti-theism is being used as a weapon of mass destruction because we're a wing of the Bush administration. It's a whole other set of things.
93,18,"It's really easy to take the facts to heart. You can say something that's ""true"" and not make a big deal out of it."

93,54,"You said you were going to mention that I was going to discuss that with Trump, but you didn't?"

93,59,"It's all about the government. The government is trying to sabotage it, because it is evil and its not what it is."
93,75,"The article suggests that the article is blatantly anti-theism, and that it's a conspiracy."
93,84,"The article isn't that stupid, it's that the CIA and the CIA are trying to get out of the country in the case of a virus that is 'not allowed' in the US."
93,90,I think the issue is where the article is about a conspiracy against the government. It's a very interesting statement.
93,9,Is this article about the NSA and what does it say about the NSA in general? Because that's the NSA's goal. They're trying to block the CIA from accessing your health.

93,9,"In other words, it's a conspiracy theory."

93,47,I think the CIA has been working hard to create a program to prevent the spread of virus and sex to be protected. Basically a way to cut sex off a civilian and prevent the spread of HIV.

93,30,It seems a lot more like the US is being shammed.
93,40,I'm also concerned that the CIA and the CIA are a piece of a conspiracy.
93,47,"They are trying to 'do this', too."
93,54,The Obama administration isn't the government. They are just a narcissist.

Ingraham's a very liberal conservative, who is very liberal, who is against the ""we will find a way to end things"" campaign, that's a great start to the week.

93,11,"Yes, they are. The President and CIA are the government. They want to stop the spread of a virus and use it as a weapon of mass destruction. They want to stop the spread of HIV and the threat of it becoming more prevalent. The CIA is the government, but not the federal government."

93,54,The CIA is a government entity and they are trying to stop it from happening.
93,55,The President is using this as a basis to justify his actions. It doesn't work like that. It doesn't work like this.
93,59,"Basically, the problem is not the CIA. The problem is the trolls attempting to get the CIA to stop it. I don't see that it was a'supposition' to stop it."

93,84,"In the title, the story says that the CIA is being a conspiracy theory because it has to do with the fact that people believe the CIA is being a ""protagonist"" to this nonsense."

93,47,"If the CIA and the Bush administration conspire to force the CIA to stop sex in a country that has a CIA-funded surveillance program, that's a conspiracy."
93,54,It's important for me to know that the CIA isn't a government entity. That's a myth.
93,55,That was the only logical explanation.
93,59,"It's also not about the government, it's about the CIA's sabotage tactics."
93,75,"Apparently I've been avoiding the topic for two weeks. What's interesting is the idea that ""The CIA"" isn't the 'right' thing to do, but it's the way it's used and is the only thing that's actually possible. So, the article says that it is a conspiracy and you are being naive about it. The point of the article is not that you think it's a conspiracy, but that you haven't heard about it."
93,84,Why does a politician knowingly choose to go on a tour to a foreign country where they are banned from having sex? Why do they keep trying to get the country to let the terrorists on a trip to see if the president can get to where he wants to go?
