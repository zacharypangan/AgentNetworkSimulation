    "This guy gets a flu shot. The government has to put the blame on him. He's not the head coach. He's the manager of the team. That's not a joke.",
    "Vaccination is terrible, because the government doesn't know what is happening with the players. The government doesn't care about the public's health. The government has no reason to be on the receiving end of the problem.",
    "As a former NFL coach, I had to take a break from my job. And it was very difficult. I knew it was a joke because the team had to go vaccinate people if they didn't need a mask. The whole point was that if the team weren't vaccinated, they wouldn't have been able to get their team to prevent the spread of a virus. It was hard and you were a coach. I didn't have a proper vaccination at all and a lot of people at my age said the joke",
    "The CDC is not the government. They are the CDC. It's a joke. They don't know what is going on with the players or the government if they aren't vaccinated. The government isn't going to help anyone on the field.",
    "What's the reason you don't have a mask?",
    "\"Hey, I'm not a coach, I just have to leave the field if I don't get vaccinated.\"",
    "So, how does the NFL prevent the spread of a virus?",
    "It is a joke. The CDC is the only organization that doesn't care about the health of the players.",
    "There's a lot of shit going on in this sub.",
    "The CDC is the government. They are the CDC. The government doesn't care what they do. The CDC is the only organization that doesn't care about the health of the players. The government isn't even telling the joke. The only thing the government doesn't care about is the fact that the players aren't vaccinated.",
    "I don't think it's funny but that they're trying to use a joke to make them seem like a joke and they have a tendency to make people think that they are just telling a joke.",
    "This isn't the CDC. It's the CDC. The CDC. They aren't. They aren't.",
    "You're a terrible football coach.",
    "Vaccination is not a joke. It is a joke, just as any other disease is not. I can't find a book that says that. The CDC has no idea what's going on in CDC-controlled situations that is even remotely funny.",
    "It sounds like the players had no immunity from the virus. It would be very bad for your health if they were on a team not having the vaccine.",
    "I have a friend who has been sick and unable to get a vaccine. It's not funny. Vaccination is awful. It's not a joke. But a joke. Vaccination is a joke. Vaccination is a joke.",
    "It's not funny. It's a joke. It's a joke.",
    "They're getting a shitload of shit from all of the teams, including the CDC, so it's a joke.",
    "\"... The government isn't the government. They are the CDC. They are the CDC. They aren't. They aren't. They aren't.\", \"The CDC is the CDC.\", \"\"Hey, I'm not a coach, I just have to leave the field if I don't get a vaccine.\",\" \"",
    "Vaccination is a joke. It's not a joke.",
    "The CDC's actions on vaccination are very different than the actions of the CDC, especially in regard to vaccine use, because vaccinations are very important for the public health of the players.",
    "The guy in the first line is a great coach.",
    "I am a great coach. I have been on a couple teams with the CDC and the National Guard. I am really interested in the game.",
    "Vaccination is awful. If the team is vaccinated, a player can not be infected. If they aren't vaccinated, they will have to get vaccinated.",
    "Is he in a medical position, or is he a professional football coach?",
    "It's a joke.",
    "As a former football coach I can say that I'm so relieved by this situation that I'm no longer able to watch football. I don't really care about that. I just think that it's a joke because I've been on my best team and I've tried it many times. It's not like the NFL is doing so poorly right now. I don't know why this guy's comment is still relevant, because it's still a joke and probably something the NFL needs.",
    "Vaccination is a joke because it's necessary to prevent the spread of a virus.",
    "Weird. The Devil Wears Masks is a really good book.",
    "As a former football coach I can say that I'm relieved by this situation that I'm no longer able to watch football. I don't care about that.",
    "They can't just give their vaccines to the team. They're going to need to wear a mask in a few months - so he has to stay on the field.",
    "The CDC needs to start putting all vaccines on the field. If you didn't get vaccinated, then you could stay on the field. The CDC is also working with the players and the media, not the players. If the players aren't vaccinated, you could stay on the field. And you could be a coach. Vaccination is awful. If the players aren't vaccinated, they could be on a team.",
    "It's funny that they have a problem with the vaccine, that they are not getting vaccinated.",
    "The CDC, which has been running a campaign to prevent the spread of infectious diseases, is on fire and out of business.",
    "I think he is being racist because it says he was in a position of power and he does not like it, but that he was actually a politician, and that he thinks it's a good idea to do this. He's not a politician, and he's not a joke.",
    "What are you talking about? It's not just a joke, it's the best way to prevent a serious illness like the flu. You have to be in a very good position to prevent the spread of viruses and bacteria. I mean, when you want to prevent the spread of viruses, a team member should do it.",
    "The guy in the first line is a great coach."
