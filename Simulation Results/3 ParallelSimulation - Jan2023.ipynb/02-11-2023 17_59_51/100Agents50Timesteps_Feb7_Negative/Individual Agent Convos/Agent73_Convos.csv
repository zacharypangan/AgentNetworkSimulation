73,35,What are you saying? That one of those?
73,36,I will be the next guy.
73,37,"If a team goes to the CDC and refuses to wear a helmet, they'll have to start a new program to do it."
73,38,This is not the OP's problem. I don't agree with this premise and I don't want my staff to be fucked.
73,48,A lot of people have already commented that they're starting to get sick and don't think to change their masks.
73,54,"I am going to resign but i am going to keep doing a helmet-less practice, if the government doesn't want to see that."
73,58,I have been wearing a mask for about 7 years now. I am sorry
73,64,"It's called ""Emergency Reverse Medicine"", and the AMA doesn't mention anything about it. Having been on the subject since I was a student in college, I've noticed that wearing a mask makes you look more tired than a normal person. I just don't feel like wearing it, and I just feel ashamed that I didn't have the time to do so. I feel better about myself now."
73,72,"I can tell you, we're just a very, very, very little group. We're a group. We're a group. We're a group. We can't change. I just know that we all have to learn to use my masks a bit more and get used to how they work. We have different rules. So if you want to be a coach, you need to learn to wear a mask and be prepared to have some fun."
74,73,"That is pretty bad - and I know they won't do it again. It's not the same. But I do love this guy and he has the same problem with the fucking masks. If you're wearing a mask, you can go on a bike ride in the park with no mask and you can fly. Unless you can go for a swim or just do it outdoors on the beach."
91,73,"I hate to be the guy who says this, but I am a coach"

101,73,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
73,1,"Wearing a mask can also cause a huge number of problems and is dangerous for you and your players. If you do it enough, you won't be able to get away with a mask."
73,8,"I agree with everyone. It's a really good way to prevent people getting sick because you can't keep yourself at bay, even if you have a mask on. I've tried to practice and I really enjoy it. I will be in a helmet for a few weeks, but have a few things on my mind to remind me not to get sick, I don't need to, but I do not want to get sick if I don't."
73,28,You've been a coach for 7 years and you've noticed that wearing a mask makes you look more tired than a normal person.
73,35,"You can't really change, so here's my take on it:"
73,36,"Is it in the rules that it has to be worn every season, or is it a special one?"

73,48,You can't help me but talk about my fear of the new rules for my team when it comes to the ACA and the NFL. That's exactly what I've gotten from my career.
73,54,What the fuck. Its not the fuck. The fuck. The fuck. The fuck.
73,58,Vaccinating against the virus is the best way to prevent this. Please wear masks.
73,64,"It was a joke by a lot of people, and this one's just not funny."
73,72,You are not the OP. This is a scam.
74,73,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.No, you don't resign. If you don't want to talk about your team then you can't talk about your teammates. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
91,73,And you lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam.
94,73,>I've found there is a special kind of mask that keeps you from touching things that might be infected. It's not worth it. It's a form of mask.
101,73,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
73,1,The guy in the pic is talking about the ACA and the NFL.
73,8,What the fuck is the joke that is?
73,28,"A bit too much for the doctor and my team. A bit of a snark and that's a bit of a stretch but, I know it's not really my fault I'm still on the team, and I think this is going to be a real issue of my health."
73,35,A lot of people have already commented that they're starting to get sick and don't think to change their masks.

73,48,It is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
73,54,Is this part of the vaccines that are used to control the spread of the virus?
73,58,"This was really not funny at all, but the ad is all about masks. I can't speak for other players, I can't talk about the players themselves. I have never seen the problem with a mask. I don't think it is worth it to go to the doctor to test for a virus but I think a mask can help prevent the problem. I think there is more to this as well, but if you're not going to go to a doctor and get tested it is an issue."
73,64,"I'm so sorry that you need to think about this. I can't believe that you're in the same position as me as a coach and I know the problem is that I am actually doing it with a mask. It's a shame you haven't got vaccinated. The idea of having a mask is just a joke in itself, but a good idea in its own right. You can't be sick if you are not wearing a mask, and it doesn't make you tired as you are a regular guy with a helmet"

74,73,"CANNOTANSWER: People are saying that the government is not doing anything that makes them feel bad. Then a government official responds by saying, ""Oh man, I don't have a mask."" That's not a reasonable response, but what they're saying is pretty unreasonable. I think it's fair that they are bringing a shitload of people into this discussion because I think they are having a problem. And that's why the government is trying to ban anyone from wearing a mask, it's a big deal. That's"
91,73,"Especially since I'm from a university, I can't really tell you what the biggest scam is. You don't need to be a college coach to get the shit out of it and then get vaccinated for a virus."
94,73,"I'm sorry but I'm not the official vaccinated coach - I work in a team based on the vaccination, and I'm not a team official - but I've been told by a guy who is the player who's only vaccinated is the head coach - you are an idiot. It's not even about wearing a mask. It's about it being on the field. Hehe."
101,73,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
73,1,Why is there something so ridiculous about this?
73,8,"I don't know if this is a joke but I think this is a legitimate way of telling the truth, as it's not going to go well at all."
73,28,"[In this case, the guy in the pic is talking about the ACA and the NFL. What the fuck is the joke that is? A bit too much for the doctor and my team. A bit too much for the doctor and my team. A bit too much for the doctor and my team."

73,37,"Is it in the rules that it has to be worn every season, or is it a special one? Because I'm not a fan of the whole ACA thing so..."
73,38,I think the biggest scam is: they are being sarcastic about it.

73,54,Vaccinating against the virus is the best way to prevent this. Please wear masks.

73,36,"As an NFL coach, I think I understand that the ACA is a joke."
73,37,"You should know that there is no law preventing people from doing this. In fact, it's an idea which is being used by the US government to prevent people from putting on masks."

73,72,They have been very patient about getting vaccinated. The ACA has prompted a lot of complaints.
74,73,That's not a good argument.

73,1,I've been in many situations where people make fun of the health care industry. The people who say that are often the only ones who are in this position.
73,8,"Well, because the game was a joke and this guy is a great guy and plays the role of a head coach in a non-profit. The ACA is actually a joke."
73,28,"I'd be mad at the guy who told me it was only a prank because he's not a doctor. He's just a dickhead, and he does not need to go through with it."
73,35,"It's a joke because they don't want to talk about it, and they want to make sure they don't get vaccinated."
73,36,A lot of times people make jokes about the ACA because they see it as a joke.
73,37,"It's not a joke, and the idea of having a ""safety plan"" is the only good argument against the ACA. ""But if the ACA is a joke, it is a joke."" ""Complaining about a joke isn't a joke. They don't care what people think of the ACA. It's a joke. I think the CDC will use some of the material they have been pushing for it.

73,38,Vaccination is an effective way to stop the spread of the virus. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to prevent it. Please wear masks.
73,48,"There's no nonsense there. The ACA isn't a joke, it's just a joke."

If you have an ACA or other insurance that doesn’t cover your medical expenses, you don’t have any right to wear one."
91,73,I think a good point is to give a snarky sarcastic comment that is clearly a joke.
94,73,"They're just trying to snoop away at the fact that the players are not vaccinated. If they don't get vaccinated at all, they're probably not vaccinated."

73,64,"The CDC, which was a lot of fun to play for in the 1980s, is trying to stop the spread of the Zika virus because they want to ban everyone from being vaccinated, but the lack of medical assistance, the amount of vaccines, etc. are all part of the ACA."
73,72,I'm pretty sure that's a very well known fact about vaccinating.
74,73,"""Cannon"" is the title of the ad. I think the ad is a bit too funny."
91,73,"We're using the vaccines because we know that it's going to protect us from viruses. We don't want it to spread. I can't imagine the health risks that we'll be faced with while we're sick because of it. But I'm just saying that, if you're willing to risk your health or if you're a government official, you should probably be prepared for the consequences."
94,73,They are trying to get a joke. The government doesn't want to be able to protect the health of the players. There is a lot of shit going on.
101,73,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
73,1,We've come to accept that a lot of people who think it is a joke don't believe the ACA exists and they will stick to the ACA.
73,8,The ACA is an issue where a team must have a waiver from the health care program they're trying to put in place to get people to get vaccinations.
73,28,I don't think the jokes are really about a medical problem that's not addressed by the media.
73,35,"I can't say I don't really like it, but I know I'm not getting it. The ACA is a joke, but the NFL is a joke, but the NFL is a joke."
73,36,That's one of the things I was thinking of when I read the article.
73,37,So the CDC is a government agency.

74,73,"It's just a prank, it's not really a joke. There is no joke or an official policy. It's a joke."
91,73,I think the joke is a joke.

73,35,"No one has said it is a joke, they just don’t understand what it means and they have to go to a doctor."
73,36,There are some really nice things people say to me.
73,37,I don't think the idea is that the ACA is going to be removed. The idea that the ACA is a joke is ridiculous.

73,58,"There is no question that 'the truth' is a joke. In this case, we are talking about 'the idea' of a joke. Vaccination isn't a joke, it's a joke."
73,64,"That's the joke. But I think the joke isn't funny because it's a joke. ""I don't think that it's a joke. The truth is that vaccination isn't a joke. The truth is that vaccination isn't a joke. The only thing they want is the ACA removed, because they don't want to stop them from doing it."""

74,73,No. You’re not in a good place.

73,38,If you've ever been to a hospital and got vaccinated you have to wear a mask to protect yourself. You can't do anything besides stay vaccinated or get vaccinated.
73,48,I think it's very interesting that a coach who knows something about vaccinations is a joke about the whole situation.
73,54,Well there isn’t anything you can do about it. It’s a joke because the government can’t do it and doesn’t want to make any decisions about it.
73,58,> Vaccination is a joke because it helps people recognize their symptoms.
73,64,And you think it's funny because it's a joke?
73,72,I'm sure the other joke isn't a joke if it's the only one. The other joke is because it's illegal. The ACA is not. The only reason it's illegal. It's illegal because it's illegal.
