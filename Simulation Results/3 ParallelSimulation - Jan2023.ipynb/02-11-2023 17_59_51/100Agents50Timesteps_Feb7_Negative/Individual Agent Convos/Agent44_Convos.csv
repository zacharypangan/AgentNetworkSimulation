52,44,The article seems very confusing and not much clear. I don't really see why you should ever be in the position of having a legitimate reason to quit coaching at a school. Is there an official that would just stand there and explain the situation?

56,44,It's pretty easy to hear that the CDC and FA are trying to spread a virus. It's what they're doing. It doesn't work on the public. You've got to have a mask to protect yourself.
61,44,"This is the best part. But it's not a meme, it's just a meme to try to get people vaccinated."
80,44,I would say there isn't much to that. The article states that people wear a mask for the sake of preventing the spread of a virus.

52,44,The joke is funny because it is a prank.
56,44,Vaccination is the only cure for a virus that is not a virus.
61,44,Vaccines are an important and good way to stop the spread of a virus.
80,44,I think the problem is not the mask. The problem is the health.
82,44,I was not able to find any video evidence on the subject of that.
86,44,The CDC did not have the funding to fund the restraining order.

61,44,I don't think this is a joke.
80,44,I'm not sure if it's the fact that they don't cover the CDC's costs but the fact that they want to help the CDC has made it a little difficult to do a good job of preventing the spread of viruses.
82,44,The government is trying to get out of control of this nonsense. It's not your right to be vaccinated. It's the government's duty to prevent them.

80,44,You think the CDC should have made a note of this?

61,44,"The CDC, the CDC and the WHO were just in conflict with the actual laws."
80,44,"In my experience, the CDC is more than happy to help people and not be the worst thing ever. I'd rather have the job of a doctor because the CDC doesn't want to work with sick patients and I don't want to spend more money on a sick kid."
82,44,Obama has a right to be vaccinated. We need people that have been vaccinated to continue living under the guise of being vaccinated. We need people who are not at all concerned with the health of others. It's not his job to prevent a virus from spreading.
86,44,The President's action was to stop the spread of a virus. It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

I don't think I would want to do it. I'd be too scared to do it. I don't think I would want to do it. I don't think I would want to do it. I don't think I would want to do it."
86,44,I'm not saying I agree with Obama and he's a troll. But this isn't a common problem.

44,19,"If there is nothing illegal to do, you can do it, but you need to make your case if you want to go on a vaccination."

56,44,"I think the idioms are used by the health care industry to justify actions they've been pursuing, but not to stop them."
61,44,Vaccination isn't a joke it's an endorsement of the idea of a sabotaging the spread of a virus. I'm not offended that it's being made.
80,44,"Why would I care? I'm a CDC worker and my work is based in a country where people wear masks, and my job is based in a country where people don't get sick. The CDC is the only authority to prevent the spread of a virus."
82,44,I’m going to say this about twitchycon and masks I will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask. I’ve been living with these jokes for 4 years. That is a great joke. In a year's time it’s been a joke that I’ve heard a lot. People are always sexist. What’s the point in being sexist?
86,44,It seems that you are using this as an attempt to imply that a law to keep people inside is not true or is at all relevant to a specific situation.

52,44,I like the idea that it is not illegal or a joke to be a part of the CDC's 'complimentary health care' policy. I'd say you can start by not trying to be a dick if you aren't vaccinated.

61,44,It sounds like the government is trying to force people to get vaccinated. The joke has become a big part of it.

80,44,This is an interesting way to look at it. I think it's time for a serious discussion with the author of this post. You've all been here for a while and aren't a member of the public. It is very sad that someone has naively chosen to leave the CDC to pursue a new career.

56,44,"The CDC is threatening to put a law in place against anyone who wears masks, as well as the US government. They are going to get sued by the NSA, who is also being sued by the FDA, as well as other medical officials for not wearing the law."
61,44,"I was in a hospital once in Florida and it was a major dick joke. I had a phd in vaccines and a mask, but it was a joke because I knew it wasn't for me. I had it a couple of times in college.

101,44,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
44,19,We're in the 70s. The CDC has been taking steps to ensure that the disease is spread as quickly as possible. We've also taken steps to ensure the CDC is making good on the vaccine.

82,44,Vaccines are not a joke. Vaccines are not a joke. The government is trying to push for a federal mandate. They can't force any kind of mandate. Unless the CDC/POLICE mandate is on TV. There are no mandates from the White House. Vaccines are not legal. The CDC has a mandate.
86,44,"A restraining order is a bad thing. 'We have a hat, a cap, and a mask, but the hat can't be worn without a mask, and our hats cannot be worn without the hat!' The restraining order was made to keep people from getting infected if they get an infection. It's not a big deal. It isn't a big deal. It isn't a big deal. It isn't a big deal. He's not a joke"
100,44,I genuinely don't have much to add to the discussion.
101,44,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
44,19,The CDC is going to have to enforce a law to prohibit vaccines in all the states.
52,44,The President has said he's going to not buy the CDC 'complimentary health care' policy because of this. Vaccination is the only cure to a virus. It's an infection and the doctors will think a prank is going on and they're not a good person.

61,44,I wore a mask in college and I had a rash.
80,44,The article states that people wear a mask to prevent the spread of HIV. This is the best way to stop the spread of the virus. The CDC does not have a mandate to prevent a person from getting vaccinated.
82,44,I think that's pretty obvious in the quote:
86,44,The government isn't letting people go outside to get a restraining order. They're just trying to prevent someone from getting sick.
100,44,"I like this post, but I think the title is pretty misleading and should be cited, because this is a racist matter and isn't going to be discussed much."

44,19,"I would consider wearing a hat, a cap and a mask a restraining order, to be a good idea."
52,44,"Vaccination is not illegal and it isn't illegal to use a mask as a cure to a virus, which can be prevented. The CDC is working with the military to make vaccines available."
56,44,"I see you’re saying that the CIA is the problem here, they just want to fuck a virus so it isn’t a joke and the government isn’t a good thing. But it’s also the problem that it’s not a good idea, and that’s a huge one."
61,44,It was a joke to ask for a mask and I was able to get a doctor who thought that was the joke a lot. I did not realize that they were trying to force me to be vaccinated unless I was forced to voluntarily put a mask on.
80,44,"There's a number of things about the CDC which isn't exactly as good as the first one, as far as I know. The first sentence is ""I love that the CDC is allowing people to wear a mask to prevent the spread of the virus. Vaccination is the best way to stop the spread of the virus."""
82,44,"So, it's an interesting story."
86,44,A restraining order is a legal restraining order. You can't have a restraining order that keeps people inside and you can't have a restraining order to keep people inside. You cannot have a restraining order to keep people inside.
100,44,"I don't have much to add, just a bit of the context."
101,44,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
44,19,I read the second paragraph. It's a witty joke and a great way to get a witty answer.
52,44,"Vaccination is not illegal and it isn't illegal to use a mask as a cure to a virus, which can be prevented. The CDC is working with the military to make vaccines available."
56,44,Vaccination is not the only cure for a virus that isn’t a virus. It’s the only cure for a virus that isn’t a virus.
61,44,"I've had my nose blown off in a twitchcon. It wasn't a joke. I wore a mask, got it vaccinated, got snorted a couple of times. It was a joke and I knew I was not good. I thought it was a joke and I wore a mask, but didn't want to slap myself with it. So I started hating the CDC and being rude. The rest is just a joke."
80,44,The title and title makes you sound very hypocritical.
82,44,Because it's about people who are being sexist and intolerant. It's an interesting story.
86,44,That's not normal behavior.

56,44,What's the'scam'? Are you looking for the idiom that says Vaccination is the only cure for a virus that isn't a virus?
61,44,I am a man who doesn't know how to deal with the CDC and the CDC. They are doing nothing but mislead people who have a very limited knowledge about vaccines.
80,44,"I have not tried. I have seen so many people that I don't even know the difference between a joke, a joke, and a joke. I have not even heard of this person, and it is very confusing for me to think of one."
82,44,Is there a law against a federal mandate to wear a mask if they have some kind of medical authority? It's a statute. That doesn't make sense to me.
86,44,I think that's a big deal. The president was being a scumbag and the restraining order has nothing to do with her. I don't see how his restraining order is not just a joke.
100,44,"""We are going to ask you how much you want to have a conversation about this, what can you do if you are going to ask me about this."

86,44,"It seems to me that it's kind of a misinterpretation. The CDC is getting all the money the 'government' is giving them, so there's probably more people in that position that are restraining orders. And the CDC was using the CDC's money to fund the restraining order."

100,44,"In his first interview with a journalist in the late 80's, he mentioned a bit that he would not wear a mask at all. He also claimed it had the potential to make him look like a twat in general. But he didn't say it was racist."
