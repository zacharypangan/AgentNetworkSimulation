93,84,"Trump said it's ok not to wear mask, and Ingraham said it's restricting our rights to keep us locked inside! You know our right to die and infect (kill) others. Why isn't Ms. Ingraham out there with them."
94,84,i love coaching however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops
84,5,The CDC would like to know if anyone is going to say it's a scam.
84,8,"I was talking about something that is considered a scam. I think this is what they call the ""Which is the problem?"" nonsense of their leadership and what they call ""I'm a bad person"" - that's something that is unnecessarily stupid and disgusting."
84,9,"It's not that the US doesn't use a mask, but that it's one of the biggest steps in helping the spread of a virus."
84,14,I am not a political scientist but I do not think I have any personal connection with the president or the administration. I think that we should not be doing anything except to encourage the President and others.
84,15,"I don't want to be like you. I just don't understand why someone would say they'd wear a mask every day, so they have to have a good hat on."
84,16,"The guy who says it's ok not to wear a mask was in the post on his site, that he doesn't wear a mask."
84,22,Exactly what i was gonna say.
84,25,You're not a scam. You're a scam. You're not a scam. You're a scam. You're a scam. You're a scam.
84,29,"I'm not sure if it is a scam or not, but it seems as though the government is using the same method of combating viruses, including those in the US."
84,30,"Unless you are the ddna official, you don't need to go out for a trip and do a lot of other stuff and this happens to the athletes if they don't wear a mask."
84,33,So why isn't my mother wearing a mask a lot?
84,39,I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam. I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam. I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam. I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam. I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam. I lose a mask at least four times a day.
84,45,It seems we're getting a bit crazy.
84,51,A mask is the act of an official to stop the spread of a virus.
84,52,"Honestly, if someone tells me they do wear masks, and then I am just going to be stuck in it for a while. So it's a scam."
84,56,Y'know... I lost a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam. I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam.
84,57,"I don't believe anything I've heard has been able to do much since I was a kid, so I think this is a good sign. I think you might be a little under the impression that you are being a dick. If it weren't for Trump, it wouldn't have happened."
84,61,I'm not sure how often they would just use a mask. I'd say you need to shave it a lot to get to the point where it doesn't work for everyone. I would just stop putting your eyes in it and go fuck off.
84,63,"If you want to get some advice from a medical professional, you must be an asshole to get one."
84,65,"I'm not so sure this is the truth, but the fact that this is a shit story about a US president trying to shut down the spread of a virus has a real impact on the whole. It's pretty much a sign of the dangers of having a good understanding of the people who are being used."
84,66,"The best I've ever known, as a player, was a mask."
84,69,It’s one of the few things we all have in common - we can have a whole range of things in common - and that’s only because we all want to be with our family or friends.
84,71,"I've never worn a mask, but now i'm wearing one :)"
84,72,There is a lot of evidence that the mask is the only way to prevent the spread of a virus
84,75,We have a problem here. The best kind of people I know who are good at talking to each other and delivering good advice is to not tell others how to do it.
93,84,"That's ridiculous. He's not even talking about the rights he is ok with, because I'm just saying that they would be stupid to not consider this as a real thing, but they aren't."
94,84,i have a couple of things that make me irritable.
84,5,This is an interesting and serious post. Here is how to get the message across:
84,8,I think this is a good sign. It's a legitimate scam and they are trying to trick people into taking a risk to stop it.
84,9,"Y'know...I've never worn a mask, but now i'm wearing one. I'm just saying that if it weren't for Trump, it wouldn't have happened."
84,14,That's because it's the best kind of people who are good at talking to each other and delivering good advice.
84,15,I'm so sorry to hear that.
84,16,I feel like a bad nut :(
84,22,I'm pretty sure you're not a scam.
84,25,"A lot of people have this problem, not sure how they'll respond, but they're not being helpful. They just want people to realize it. They know that, so that's the thing, but they have a problem to fix."
84,29,What is the government's attempt to combat a virus?
84,30,It seems like the US president is doing a shit job.
84,33,It's a scam. We've just had this happen a few times and we don't have any problems.
84,39,"I'm afraid it's a scam. Besides, if the CDC is using a mask, there's probably no way it can help the spread of viruses - people may just not be able to do anything about it."
84,45,I don't see how you'd explain it.
84,51,"I was in a hockey game on a Wednesday night and my mask was on for several hours, but I lost a lot of weight despite it. A little bit of weight isn't the only thing I needed to do for a win. Those are the days, I'd try to cut some loose ends so I can not make fun of people who don't wear masks. I can't imagine the ddna guys wearing a mask when they are playing for my team."
84,52,A mask isn't the most effective way to prevent or stop the spread of a virus. A mask is the best way to stop or prevent the spread of a virus.
84,56,"I want to make sure you are not being in a position to use the mask, but when you do, you should be able to see what's going on."
84,57,"My brother and I had the same conversation once... I figured out why we lost a mask when I was a kid and we had a bit of a different perspective. I'm not a fan of wearing masks, but I can tell you the difference in what we did and what I did, versus what I could do in the '50s."
84,61,"I don't see a point in calling someone ""scam"" in this instance."
84,63,"I don't think this is a scam, but if someone is telling you to do it, or if you're going to have an accident, you're probably an asshole."
84,65,...that's the one time I had the dna ds - if i got my ddna on and then went through it again - i'd do it again.
84,66,"This seems a little more shady, but the fact that it's so easy to stop people from using masks, fuck him!"
84,69,I lost my mask at the age of 14 when I was about 12. Now my parents wear my mask. We go to the gym every day and go to sleep with them. It is so easy to lose a mask that my mom will probably come for the first time if she isn't out in a few weeks.
84,71,You're a scam. You're a scam.
84,72,Its not like the President is trying to shut down the spread of a virus.
84,75,"I've done the same thing to my parents, my wife and my mother. We lost a lot of masks in the last 10 years. They still wear it to protect themselves."
93,84,"As a non-semite, I have to say it's not just the government."
94,84,"I've been in a few cases that were caused by a virus and I thought if they didn't stop the virus, they would just eat and drink."
84,5,It sounds like he's just trying to protect his family by saying he is going to continue doing that without causing problems for people who need to learn to use a mask.
84,8,Having a mask on means you're going to want to wear one. Wearing one can help keep people from getting sick. If it doesn't help they just go to their doctor and let them do their own research.
84,9,Why would you wear a mask? It is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
84,14,It's not like the President is trying to shut down the spread of a virus.
84,15,i think it's time to put on some sunscreen. I've shaved my head off since I was 10 i lost my mask.
84,16,"I'd suggest you give the CDC a call for help, even if that's not an option. If they're using a mask, it would not prevent the spread of a virus."
84,22,Its not just the president. Its a conspiracy theory. The whole idea is to keep the people alive by doing things that would cause them to die. The fact that they would lose the mask is a huge scam.
84,25,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
84,29,I have a friend who has never lost a mask.
84,30,"> Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.A lot of people have this problem, not sure how they'll respond, but they have a problem to fix. What is the government's attempt to combat a virus?"
84,33,"Is the idea of wearing a mask because the person you aren't being a fraudster? Because you're not a scammer. This is a very common problem of the government. People will say things like ""I'm not being a scammer."" or ""I'm a scammer."" I've seen people say the same thing to me about ""I lost my mask when I was 14"". ""I'm a scammer"" but it sounds like everyone is."
84,39,You're a scam.
84,45,I'm not sure how to explain it. Isn't it a scam? Isn't it a scam because it's a scam.
84,51,"A mask is one of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.A lot of people have this problem, not sure how they'll respond, but they're not being helpful. They just want people to realize it. They know that, so that's the thing, but they have a problem to fix. What is the government's attempt to combat a virus? It seems like the US president is doing a shit job. It's a scam. It seems like the country is doing a shit job."
84,52,We don't have a virus.
84,56,"You have a job, I know, you have a family, you have a career, and I don't even have a job, so I don't really have a job. You have a family, I don't have a job. Those jobs are really important, but they're not your responsibility unless you are really in the wrong."
84,57,"Yes, you can get yourself a mask but you can't do it, you can't get away with it. If you're a virus or a person is carrying a virus, you should not be using it."
84,61,If I had my eyes in my mouth every day a lot of the time I would just cut my nose. I'm not sure how to tell. I want to make sure I'm not being in a position to use the mask.
84,63,"It's the CDC scum that gets the government doing what they do. But, this is the problem they're getting out of the way. They will be trying to stop people from using these masks, but they can't."
84,65,"No, this isn't a scam. It's a conspiracy theory."
84,66,I'm pretty sure the guy that is doing it is a scam.
84,69,">My mom has no way to stop a virus, she wears it to protect herself."
84,71,">I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam.', ""I've never worn a mask, but now i'm wearing one :)"", ""You're a scam. You're a scam."""
84,72,It's been on my list of things to do.
84,75,"The whole ""I have a problem here. The best kind of people I know who are good at talking to each other and delivering good advice is to not tell others how to do it."" thing is a scam, I'm not a fan of it."
93,84,"Is it not possible that the government has the power to do something, that's not the point of this post?"
94,84,"If the player isn't getting vaccinated, they're getting more likely to die."
84,5,The way the CDC wants to do this is to help prevent the spread of the virus.
84,8,The CDC is very active on this issue.
84,9,"This is the problem, I don't see how that's any better."
84,14,"It seems like the president is doing a shit job. It's a scam, but the CDC is actually doing a good job at fixing the situation. The guy isn't a scammer, they are a scammer."
84,15,"I’ve lost one of my old masks. He doesn’t wear it anymore. It’s only one he wears. I mean, no one actually wears a mask in his life. It’s a scam, but not a scam."
84,16,This is a scam. They're not a scam.
84,22,"I've never been vaccinated. I've been vaccinated before, and have yet to get one in my mouth, but it was a great help in being vaccinated."
84,25,"/r/legaladvice and /r/legaladvice all had a story on - ""I lose my mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam."" [NAME] has some weird stuff for the last few days:"
84,29,"Yes, I'm a scammer, and that's exactly what I said. I am a CDC scum, and it is scam, but it is a scam because people use it to stop the spread of a virus and I am not a scammer. Is this the right thing to do for the people to do?"
84,30,This is a really common problem of the government.
84,33,[I lost my mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam.]
84,39,"I'm not saying it's a scam, but the fact that they're just trying to help make people realize that they're not being a scam isn't a legitimate reason to use it."
84,45,"If you are carrying a virus in your body, and it spreads through your mouth and to your eyes, then yes, you have a problem with it."
84,51,I think there are a few things that are a scam to do:
84,52,"""Hey, I'm going to need to see the CDC. Is there anything else you can do to help with this?"""
84,56,I think it's a great idea to try something new with my mom if she can get the help she needs from someone who knows her way around the virus.
84,57,"I'm not saying that this is a scam, but I do believe that the government's ability to fight the spread of a virus is one of the big pillars of our government's effectiveness."
84,61,I'm not sure how I'd say that to someone who is not a virus. My dad said that he didn't think people could get it. But he was a joke.
84,63,"It seems like this is an ad hoc problem and has some pretty big side effects. There's a reason for that, but it isn't the right thing to do. This is something you have to do if you want to be a threat to yourself or someone."
84,65,There is a bunch of things going on in the media:
84,66,"As someone who lost a mask at 14, I am convinced that the best I have ever known, as a player, was a mask."
84,69,"I was always going to get my mask off my nose, and then it went off in a puddle of water. I got it off the ground and they just didn't say anything. I was like, ""I've never seen a puddle of water and a bloody nose!"" and then I stumbled out of the shower with no mouth. I didn't want to go back. When they saw me, I said, ""I lost my mask but it was too bad for me,"" and the guy who brought it back in the house."
84,71,That's a scam. This is a scam. This is a scam.
84,72,There is a lot of evidence that the mask is the only way to stop the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
84,75,"I mean, there's probably a lot of people out there that are expressing disgust and don't understand it because they don't know it's a scam."
93,84,Well that is a good point of trolls and racists. Unless they're a very bigoted narcissist if they want to have sex.
94,84,"I can tell you that this is why there are so many vaccinated players, that the number of masks that have been around is ridiculous and stupid. It's actually ridiculous that all they do is smack them in the face about it."
84,5,"I've lost a lot of masks and the CDC is one of the few agencies that has a lot of people on their radar if they think they are safe. I'm not sure if they were a scam, but I don't know if they were the ones that gave it away or even the ones that tried to help us in our dealings."
84,8,You are the greatest scum of the internet.
84,9,"I am so sorry to hear that, and I am so sorry to hear that. This is a huge scam and I know that the government is doing everything they can to help the people who aren't a threat. I'm very glad I didn't lose a mask in the first place because I would not be able to do anything."
84,14,"The government is doing a good job at fixing the situation. The guy isn't a scammer. I'm sure they have a lot of info to back it up but there aren't any people on the web that actually use it. It's just a part of their job, to tell people that it's not scam and they don't know if they're scams."
84,15,So basically the government has given people a mask in order to stop the spread of a virus?
84,16,"There are people who just can't see their masks. People who just don't see their masks, and people who can't see their masks, have no idea what they're doing."
84,22,"I've been vaccinated twice, I lost my mask, and when it's off, it's just for my shit, but it's in my mouth. I have never had a good experience with it."
84,25,This is a really sad picture of your mom.
84,29,I had a couple of them on the internet but had never heard of them. Then it popped up on my Facebook page.
84,30,I'm surprised CDC does not have more information on this than the people with the shittiest fucking ddna.
84,33,"The idea of wearing a mask because the person you aren't being a fraudster is a scam, and it isn't a legitimate reason to use it."
84,39,"I would say it's a scam, and this isn't about the mask. It's about people trying to protect themselves from the virus."
84,45,"As someone who lost a mask at 14, I am convinced that the best I have ever known, as a player, was a mask. I was always going to get my mask off my nose, and then it went off in a puddle of water. I got it off the ground and they just didn't say anything. I was like, ""I've never seen a puddle of water and a bloody nose!"" and then I stumbled out of the shower with no mouth. I didn't want to go back. I think there are a few things that are"
84,51,...It seems like the US President is doing a shit job. It seems like the country is doing a shit job.
84,52,I lost a mask when I was 14. I was always going to get my nose off and then it went off in a puddle of water.
84,56,"""I'm not a scammer, and it is scam, but it is a scam because people use it to stop the spread of a virus and I am not a scammer. Is this the right thing to do for the people to do?"""
84,57,... And they say something about how the government is just trying to make people realize it is a scam and that they are a scammer.
84,61,People don't like wearing a mask. It's a very big part of how the government operates.
84,63,"""[NAME] has some weird stuff for the last few days:"
84,65,They don't get it. There's so many facts to be had.
84,66,"I'm not sure I'm going to be the only one that sees this, but I'm very sure that the guy who is doing it is a scam. This is a scam."
84,69,"That's not a scam, that's a scam. I am sure that someone will tell you that."
84,71,I've never seen a story about someone wearing a mask and seeing how it's helping them to stop the spread of the virus. This is the most common scam.
84,72,The mask thing is not just a scam. Its part of the plan and the main purpose of vaccination.
84,75,"I was a soccer player at 14. I lost a mask when I was like 8. I tried to get my head back in a nutshell, and a tarp went off. There was an oxford basketball player there who wore a mask. I told him it was a scam and asked him for help a couple times. Eventually he was like ""no."" I told him my friend would give him a hard time and I said ""no, I am not a scammer. If you want to go to the gym, just come out of the"
93,84,This isn't what the wiki article suggests. It's the actual name of a conspiracy theory.
94,84,"Vaccination is a terrible disease. If your team is vaccinated, a player can not be infected. If they are not vaccinated, you will have to wear a mask. It's a bad thing. The only way to stop it is to put on a mask so you can be vaccinated."
84,5,"I volunteered at a local medical center and they've been trying to get me to be vaccinated, if I wear a mask when I play football and then a month or two later I can go to the health clinic and find out how to protect myself without spouting blood and coughing. They also have an online AMA."
84,8,I don't think he's a doctor so I'd think it's good to know that he's a doctor because it's a scam.
84,9,I had a friend who used to do the same thing. He never wore a mask. He had to keep his face in a puddle of water - he wouldn't put the head in the puddle. He lost his mask and I threw a tarp around his face.
84,14,Is it possible that this is a conspiracy theory if you don't know what it is?
84,15,"In other words, the government has given people a mask in order to stop the spread of a virus. I don't want to be like you."
84,16,I read this in the voice of the American Psychologists who worked with them. They say that they are the only thing stopping the spread of HIV. I believe that the government is making it so that the people who have the disease are not sick by not being vaccinated.
84,22,I was a soccer player at 14 but I don't get to go to the gym. I got some shit off the ground and lost my mask. Then I stumbled out the shower with no mouth. I didn't go back.
84,25,I know exactly what you mean...
84,29,The idea that you're not a scammer is part of the CDC's attempt to combat a virus.
84,30,I think this is a pretty important point in understanding the virus in regards to the mask thing.
84,33,I was very suspicious of the CDC. They do not have much info on this yet.
84,39,"I'm a huge soccer fan, and don't think I ever went back to my dad's house. Especially since I'm really only 14 and it was a pretty nasty thing to see, when I was just 14."
84,45,">The idea of wearing a mask because the person you aren't being a fraudster is a scam, and it isn't a legitimate reason to use it. I would say it's a scam, and this isn't about the mask."
84,51,"Probably one of the few times they will say something like ""oh it ain't about you, it sucks when you are out of breath, it sucks that i lost a mask when i was 14."""
84,52,"I was in college and had a huge sprained nose, because the vaccine was only for soccer players. I also got one of those masks as a kid."
84,56,"It seems like the guy who got him and a lot of others in the US that went in with a fake mask is just a scumbag, it's the guy who just went to a different country and put up a fake face that was actually made up and it wasn't real."
84,57,What can the government do with your mask and what a good excuse to not wear one? That's not a scam.
84,61,"I'd take a narwhal mask for an hour and a half, and leave it in the room for two minutes. That's what the Doctor told us, but it's a narwhal and they can't just wear it on their face."
84,63,"The first part of the story is called ""Pihoned into an infection by a mask. ""."
84,65,"My mother had a mask while I was in school. Hers was a little long after her graduation. When she did graduate and went through the test, it changed the face of her head. It wasn't so much on her face as on her face. It was in her face and not on hers."
84,66,The CDC said they are working on vaccination and the guy who is doing it is not being a scammer. So they think it is a scam.
84,69,This is a huge part of the reason you were never vaccinated.
84,71,The only thing that is clear is that you are trying to get rid of a virus that is being spread around the world without the government in control.
84,72,I'm confused because of the title. I didn't want to know what it was but I could tell it's not even a scam.
84,75,"This isn't what the wiki article suggests. It's the actual name of a conspiracy theory. Vaccination is a terrible disease. If your team is vaccinated, a player can not be infected. If they are not vaccinated, you will have to wear a mask. The only way to stop it is to put on a mask so you can be vaccinated."
93,84,CANNOTANSWER. It's not about the government. I think the government is more responsible for preventing the spread of HIV and is more prone to the spread of other HIV infections.
94,84,I don't like how the government doesn't even mention being vaccinated because of an unrelated illness.
84,5,"The CDC isn't going to stop the spread of a virus because the mask isn't up to a level of safety. The CDC is going to try and make sure that people know that the masks are actually fake and that this has been done to protect the country, not a government agency."
84,8,>I was very suspicious of the CDC. They do not have much info on this yet.
84,9,"Vaccination is a terrible disease. If your team is vaccinated, a player can not be infected. If they are not vaccinated, you will have to wear a mask. The only way to stop it is to put on a mask. The only way to stop it is to be vaccinated."
84,14,"They have a great job at proving what it means. It's not like the government is doing anything, but it's the CDC and it seems they have a lot of info to back it up."
84,15,"""It's a scam, but not a scam."""
84,16,The first part is a scam.
84,22,It's about the government. A fag is a fag.
84,25,What do you think the CDC is referring to?
84,29,"The people who aren't vaccinated are a scumbag and the people who aren't, and they need to be vaccinated. They are not scammers because they are not scammed."
84,30,It's all about the mask. It's about the vaccine. The mask. The face.
84,33,"This isn't a scam, it's a fraud."
84,39,That is a scam! But how many times is it not a scam to go to a doctor and make you go to the doctor to see if you are being vaccinated? Because this isn't a scam. The only way to stop it is to do something about it.
84,45,I think that the masks are part of the scams because of the masks they have. I guess the joke was that it was so much more interesting than anything else. I think that it does make sense that if you are a fraudster that they can't take you seriously but you aren't doing anything wrong.
84,51,"The first part of the story is called ""Pihoned into an infection by a mask."""
84,52,There is no actual reason for anyone to wear a mask and this is not the way they do it.
84,56,>What can the government do with your mask and what a good excuse to not wear one? That's not a scam.
84,57,"It's not just the CDC and other countries trying to combat the spread of HIV and its spread. It's the US government trying to do the same thing, just with less money."
84,61,"I don't have a choice. I think you're right about the ""what if I got a narwhal mask when i was 14."" argument."
84,63,"Vaccination is a terrible disease. If your team is vaccinated, a player can not be infected. If they are not vaccinated, you will have to wear a mask. The only way to stop it is to put on a mask. The only way to stop it is to put on a mask so you can be vaccinated."
84,65,"""...I have a friend who had a dna on and then went through it again - i'd do it again."""
84,66,"I'm just gonna say a simple truth, but this isn't about the government. They're more responsible for helping prevent HIV and preventing it - and then they just say ""we're helping us prevent this "". They do it to help prevent a virus, but it's not about the government, and it's not about the mask itself. It's about the mask, not the virus."
84,69,What was the name of this man who threw a mask on him?
84,71,I'm a college football fan. But I always have that mask tucked away in my pocket. :)
84,72,"I grew up in a very conservative area, but when I had my first vaccination I was probably not vaccinated. But then the vaccines came and I didn't. I was in a very restrictive area."
84,75,"As others have noted, I've had multiple masks worn by people of the same gender. I've also had some cases of those masks being lost by people whose mothers and dads never got them."
93,84,Is there some point where they are arguing that wearing a mask in public is a part of the anti -semitic plan to prevent people from having sex?
94,84,"Vaccination is terrible. Vaccination is a terrible disease. If the team is vaccinated, a player can not be infected. If they are not vaccinated, you will have to wear a mask."
84,5,"""Foolish"" is a slang term for a phrase used to describe someone with a CDC membership who has received HIV/AIDS, as well as a number of other virally induced diseases."
84,8,I have an article about this:
84,9,They are trying to stop the spread of AIDS and I'm so glad they are doing it.
84,14,"I guess it is a scam, but the CDC has a lot of info. That's all the CDC has."
84,15,"It's not a scam. The government is just trying to help stop the spread of a virus, and if you don't want to be like me, you don't need a mask."
84,16,I've never seen a good doctor whose job it is to prevent people from having sex.
84,22,"I think that the first part of the story is called ""Pihoned into an infection by a mask."" There is no actual reason for anyone to wear a mask and this is not the way they do it."
84,25,"In many countries, it's not even the disease, it's the whole human body trying to kill us."
84,29,I'm going to say a simple truth - I grew up in a very conservative area and I've had multiple masks worn by people of the same gender. I've also had some cases of those masks being lost by people whose mothers and dads never got them. I think that it does make sense that if you are a fraudster that they can't take you seriously but you aren't doing anything wrong.
84,30,Why doesn't the U.S. government just put the mask on someone they know can be a danger?
84,33,"I can't stand Vaccination because of it, and that's a bit of a stretch compared to being vaccinated in the US."
84,39,"Vaccination is a terrible disease. If the team is vaccinated, a player can not be infected. If they are not vaccinated, you will have to wear a mask.

84,45,"My mom had a vaccine, but she was afraid that if I didn't have a proper mask, I would go to the doctor, because that would keep my mouth shut, and I'd be unable to see it or smell it. I'd have to pay a lot of money to be vaccinated."
84,51,"I'm a huge anti-semite. I know the CDC doesn't have an exact number, but I think it's a scam to try and smear a name onto the entire population."
84,52,"This is about the CDC... I'm not saying they're trying to stop the spread of HIV or not. I'm just saying they're trying to help prevent the spread of the virus, and the CDC's policies about that."
84,56,"As a US citizen, my mom and her husband were all having a hard time dealing with the virus. She was trying to convince him that the vaccine should be banned as they are currently being introduced."
84,57,A scam is the way we get around the problem of people getting a virus that doesn't have a true cure.
84,61,I'd cut my nose every day. I'm not sure how to tell. I want to make sure I'm not being in a position to use the mask. I'm not sure how to tell. I want to make sure I'm not being in a position to use the mask.
84,63,"My mother would try to get me a piece of the virus when she woke up. She'd try it and have her own infection, but she has no idea how to get it."
84,65,"I'm not sure that this is a true story, but I have never heard the phrase ""I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam."" or ""I think that's the one time I had the dna ds - if i got my dna on and then went through it again - i'd do it again."""
84,66,I'd have to guess that you're talking about wearing a mask in public.
84,69,"A lot of people seem to think that wearing a mask to prevent HIV is a scam, and in fact a fraud."
84,71,People wear masks in public to prevent the spread of HIV.
84,72,"Why aren't some of the people with masks and their dicks, on a diet, that are so unhealthy and aren't allowed to shit themselves?"
84,75,I have been on the side of the U.S. government with you. I think they're the type of people to get infected by the CDC (I don't know if that makes sense but they can be really good at it).
93,84,"CANNOTANSWER. It's not just about the government. I think the CIA and NSA are doing something wrong, which is why sex is illegal on our borders."
94,84,I've only been in the NFL for almost three years. I don't think any of this will happen again. I don't think any of this will happen again.
84,5,This isn't just about the government. This is about the CIA and NSA.

84,9,"I have never heard the phrase ""I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam."
84,14,"What a huge, utter fucking crock."
84,15,There is a link to a story about my father with a mask on that was stolen. It says he was sent to the CDC to get a vaccine.
84,16,"I can tell you this, I'm so scared of the new system and the whole country will just be full of dicks. This isn't going to change."
84,22,I don't think you're going to think this through.
84,25,"> I think the CIA and NSA are doing something wrong, which is why sex is illegal on our borders."
84,29,... and you are a scammer.
84,30,I believe the CDC is actually trying to find an antisemite person to try and protect the American people. They seem like some sort of prick nutty.
84,33,"If this is the case, I would go with that line."
84,39,"I'd say it's a scam because it's not going to stop the spread of HIV. In many countries, it's not even the disease, it's the whole human body trying to kill us."

84,51,"As an American who's gotten vaccinated for HIV/VHC, I don't think sex is a problem, that's why you have to wear a mask. I don't think they are doing anything wrong, but they are doing something wrong."
84,52,What's a scam?
84,56,"I don't think I've heard the phrase ""I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam."" at all, and also not quite the same as saying ""You have a job, I know, you have a career, and I don't even have a job, so I don't really have a job."""

84,65,"That's not a scam. It's a scam. It's a fake. They're all false, but the people who are falsely accused of being false aren't a false positive. The facts are that there are no real proofs of their falsehoods, and that the real crime is that the falsehoods aren't false."

94,84,"I've been in the NFL for almost 3 years. I don't know what you're talking about, but it isn't an official job. I'm a teacher and I work at the university I graduated from, but it was the second season I was in a hockey game. I was in the ER and they took away my helmet. I was still vaccinated after the game because of the flu. They used to do the same thing when I was in college. They're pretty useless as they are."", ""I don't know what you're talking about"
84,5,People get sick and die on the streets by wearing masks to stop HIV.
84,8,Is the whole CIA and NSA stuff in your head really that important?
84,9,"My son has never had a doctor or been vaccinated for HIV or HBV, so he doesn't think that's a scam. The problem is that the vaccine is not needed because it's harmful to the health and the health of the body. It's a kind of shady idea."
84,14,"The CDC has no control over the virus, and I’m afraid they have no legal jurisdiction over it."
84,15,"The question is what kind of AIDS are you talking about. I think you are addressing the situation of the vaccines, in the US, which is essentially ""antisemitism"". That seems to be a way of describing how these people might be trying to get vaccines for AIDS. You're going to think of the people who are getting vaccines a lot. The first thing you can do is to talk about the disease."
84,16,I read the title and thought you weren't the only one
84,22,I've been in the NFL for almost 3 years. I don't think any of this will happen again. I don't think any of this will happen again.

84,5,"No, it's not a scam. A virus can't spread quickly enough for you to actually be vaccinated."
84,8,Isn't it a good sign to let the CDC know that the CDC is using a fake vaccination vaccine to stop the spread of HIV/VHC?

84,33,I've also seen a joke like that:

84,51,"The CDC was talking to a reporter when he learned he was not going to have a sex test for the virus because he did not have the vaccine and the investigators had an inability to identify the virus.

84,52,> I think that wearing a mask in public is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.You're not a scam. You're not a scam.
84,56,The issue is not whether people wear masks because of illness but because they think that they can be used to stop the spread of the virus.
84,57,"The only time I've ever heard it like that was at my job. The guy I worked with was a woman. A man who is not a guy got the wrong thing and his mask was on and on. He still has a man's mask.

84,51,"I'd also like to point out that the CDC and the NSA are in conflict with the actual laws. That's one of the few times they seem to be giving the truth, but I know they're being lied to, so they make a lot of money, but they have a problem to fix."
84,52,"I don't really think the President is doing a good job, because he allegedly said: I lose a mask at least four times a day, but you want to tell me that's part of the work that the US is doing? Why does that even exist? The reason is that we do not do that is to do it to protect people with the virus."
84,56,"""[[Do they want to have a reason to wear a mask? I don't think I've heard of that word](http://www.reddit.com/news/Smiling.aspx)]."
84,57,It’s been a long time since I was on that phone.
84,61,The title makes me feel uncomfortable about the people who are putting a mask on in public. And I am afraid it's not really a slander.
84,63,"Vaccination is a terrible disease. If the team is vaccinated, a player can not be infected. If they are not vaccinated, you will have to wear a mask. The only way to stop it is to put on a mask. The only way to stop it is to put on a mask."
84,65,"No, I'm not gonna lie. There are some pretty terrible things going on in the media."
84,66,"A lot of people get vaccinated for HIV/VHC. Not only is it an awful disease, it's one of the most important things we can do."
84,69,"I love all these things. The most important thing is to be vaccinated, not just a virus."
84,71,I think the people of these communities are getting the message.
84,72,Is it a scam to want to snoop on the government to stop the spread of a virus?
84,75,> I lost a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam.
93,84,I was going to mention this:
94,84,"If you don't think you'll ever get sick again, get back to school."
84,5,I was talking to someone today that actually lost a mask.
84,8,"I'm really sorry. I lost my mask because I was playing with a friend, I'm really sorry about it."
84,9,"It's a joke that has been sung in the past, which is what many people have referred to as'shady'. This isn't a joke, but a scam."
84,14,"Vaccination is a terrible disease. If the team is vaccinated, a player can not be infected. If they are not vaccinated, you will have to wear a mask. The only way to stop it is to put on a mask. The only way to stop it is to put on a mask."
84,15,I read that it was a real deal and I was not going to be honest. I've heard some similar stories in the media.
84,16,"No, that's not a scam."
84,22,"""The devil wears masks."""
84,25,"The problem with this is that people are too scared to get vaccinated. They are too scared to get vaccinated. And if they can't prevent you from getting vaccinated and being a scammer, they can't help but be sick again."
84,29,A bunch of things in this world that are actually true and aren't really going to change.
84,30,"A lot of people have this problem, not sure how they'll respond, but they have a problem to fix."
84,33,"I'm a doctor and I want to avoid the dangers associated with my infection. I need a virus vaccine. The first three of those should be a problem, and it isn't that easy to avoid. If they just put on the mask, they're only going to be more effective in stopping the spread of the virus. It's also not a problem."
84,39,Why don't they get paid to stop people from having sex? Because that's the only way to stop it.
84,45,"The word ""scam"" is misleading and misleading."
84,51,It's not a scam to want to snoop on the government to stop the spread of the virus.
84,52,The CDC is in conflict with the law. They have to have a problem to fix.
84,56,"A lot of people get vaccinated. Not only is it an awful disease, it's one of the most important things we can do. I love all these things. The most important thing is to be vaccinated, not just a virus. I love all these things. The most important thing is to be vaccinated, not just a virus."
84,57,"The people putting on masks.. is actually a good sign, to say the least. The CDC wants to cut costs, so they put on the masks. I guess it's not a huge scam."
84,61,I lost a mask a few weeks ago at the age of 14 and it still hasn't died. I was actually able to see it when I was 15.
84,63,"I'm so sorry, my friend, but how many people have you heard?"
84,65,It's pretty clear that there is a lot going on in the media.
84,66,I think the whole point of a mask is to keep the CDC and NSA safe. But if they don't want you to do it they won't give you the pass.
84,69,"Those are some terrible things that people think about. Not only is it a terrible disease, but it's one of the most important things we can do."
84,71,I don't care about the people who wear masks in public to prevent the spread of HIV. I would rather not get vaccinated.
84,72,">I am gonna call out the ""scam"" in a moment and ahem, it is just the fact that the CDC has tried to fight the spread of a virus by creating more masks. I am really sorry that happened."
84,75,"That is a good article, but I find this very interesting."
93,84,The wiki article is just the fact that the post has been deleted by a friend and is a bit misleading.
94,84,"It's a joke. If someone doesn't take the time to properly clean up their mouth a couple of times, they are not going to get it right."
84,5,No one would like to know if the CDC is going to be able to protect themselves from the spread of HIV.
84,8,"I was wondering what you'd think of the CDC's snooping with the NSA? They should be paying to snoop on them to stop HIV, but that's all I know now."
84,9,"Vaccination is a very dangerous disease, so the government has to be very serious about it. It’s also an important and important thing that many people want to do, especially in this kind of situation."
84,14,I like sex! I feel like the only other option I have to do is to smack it with my hand.
84,15,Basically the government is trying to do something in a way to stop the spread of HIV. It can get pretty shady.
84,16,I've read the article and I didn't know it was a scam.
84,22,Well... I am so sorry that happened.
84,25,"...and to be honest, the most common reason people are scared of a virus is a poor quality of life."
84,29,It's not a scam. They are a scam. It's a joke. Is this the right thing to do?
84,30,"My first thought was that the government is getting more money from the health care system and the CDC has been trying to spread the virus by providing more masks to people, making it easier for people to become sick and get vaccinated. And then I thought about all the rumors that the government is helping to stop a virus from spreading."
84,33,"I had to get some vaccination, but it didn't help much at all. My fiancee has no idea what to do. So he sucked it up and it's on to me."
84,39,"Well if you get the vaccine you should go to the CDC and vaccinate yourself. The CDC is a scam, but the CDC needs to be able to get it at some point, because that's not a legitimate reason for people to use it. It's not a scam."
84,45,"I am not a doctor and it is very unfortunate that there are so many people who are not vaccinated. My family are all the same - my mother was a CDC worker. I was 15 when they started vaccinating me and I thought the only thing vaccinated me would be was having sex with my wife. Then they were telling me that I was a fraud and that I had a problem. Now they are a scam, they are a scam."
84,51,"This is so true. They are not snooping on the government because the President doesn't care enough about them to do it. They need to be listened to and trained to be aware of what is happening. That being said, I'm not sure that anyone else is telling you exactly how a CDC/NSA issue works."
84,52,'I lost a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam.'
84,56,"The only way that the ""Scam"" is to get people to get vaccinated is to stop them from having sex."
84,57,"I'm not going to lie, this is a horrible thing to say. It's really just a big piece of shit."
84,61,I lost a mask when I was 14. I think this is a scam.
84,63,I just want to add to the first two things.
84,65,I believe that this is a conspiracy theory.
84,66,"There's a lot of truths here, but I find the CDC to be a bit too harsh, because they want to cut costs and make it a little easier for people to stay safe. The whole point of a mask is to keep the CDC and NSA safe. Having a vaccine prevents that and they are working on a vaccine."
84,69,Vaccinating can't be a problem if there is a way to prevent it. I have a fever that gets a little painful. I do not need a vaccine to prevent it. Especially since it is usually a virus and not a virus.
84,71,I don't think this is a scam.
84,72,"I think the title of the wiki article is misleading and misleading. It's a joke. If someone doesn't take the time to properly clean up their mouth a couple of times, they are not going to get it right."
84,75,"The CDC and NSA are suing this post for fraud, not fraud."
93,84,This has been posted about a million times on here.
94,84,"The point isn't to make a joke, it's to imply that it is."
84,5,This post is just so sad.
84,8,I'm going to add a few things:
84,9,"This is my life choice. I'm a lawyer. If I don't get a vaccinated or vaccinated I should get a hrovac. I get my HBR too. I don't know how to get a hrovac and a hrovac and hrovac. But when you're looking to get one of those hrovacs, I know you're going to vaccinate yourself. I am not a doctor. And it's not a scam."
84,14,I've seen the CDC and the NSA post it on their Facebook.
84,15,">The only way that the ""Scam"" is to get people to get vaccinated is to stop them from having sex."
84,16,"I didn't know that people were vaccinated, but I do know that you've been vaccinated to prevent HIV and to not have to keep yourself infected, and that the CDC is suing you."
84,22,Vaccination is not a scam. Is a mask a scam? Its not just a scam.
84,25,It's not a scam. It's a scam.
84,29,Vaccination is the number one reason to get vaccinated.
84,30,I've lost a mask at least once a day.
84,33,"Vaccination is a complicated, fucked up process. So how do you prevent a health crisis? How do you prevent a virus from spreading?"
84,39,So... you have a fever?
84,45,A scam would be the best way to get a vaccinated person to go get a vaccine.
84,51,The NSA is not a scam at all. The CDC is not in conflict with the law.
84,52,I am very sorry to hear that!
84,56,"It's just a joke. It's a little misleading and the CDC and NSA are suing this post for fraud. The point isn't to make a joke, it's to imply that it is."
84,57,"Well, this is very confusing. The idea is that you have a face mask that means you can't have it on you. That's what I said."
84,61,"It's a pretty bad snoop, especially since a lot of the things you're talking about are actually false. The only thing they do to prevent a virus is to reduce their exposure to others."
84,63,You have to tell your friend to get vaccinated.
84,65,"I've never heard the phrase ""I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam."
84,66,There are lots of other things I've heard that they're working on:
84,69,Vaccinating for HIV is a scam. A CDC/NSA scam. Vaccinating against HIV is a scam.
84,71,"The point isn't to make a joke, it's to imply that it is."
84,72,I'd tell them that they are not just scammers.
84,75,"I think this is a really stupid question and I am not sure how someone can get a response without looking like I'm a troll, especially a kid who could just say ""Well, I do like to wear a mask, I think I might need to wear one now."""
93,84,Are you an american? The CIA and NSA have been around a long time.
94,84,"This is not just a joke, it's about what you are making out there. What you're doing is a joke. It's not your fault."
84,5,"It's funny that 'Foolish' is used to describe the CDC, as a general term."
84,8,This is not a joke. It's a scam. This is a joke. This is a scam.
84,9,It's so sad. I am actually very thankful for what this means. This is a pretty good point. Especially as a man who is currently a kid.
84,14,This sounds like a big bluff to me. The Obama administration is being really inefficient and it's making it very difficult for us to stop doing anything except to encourage the President and others.
84,15,"I'm an american, and this post is about something a lot of people do not understand. It's very misleading. The CDC and NSA are suing this post for fraud."
84,16,A friend of mine lost his face mask all the time in the summer and had to go to a hospital to get him vaccinated. He says he has an extra one for a bluff every time he gets to visit the doctors. He was in a fucking accident and had to get himself vaccinated.
84,22,The CDC and NSA are suing this post for fraud.
84,25,"I don't know, that's how it came out."
84,29,The government has been around a long time and their attempt to evade them sucks.
84,30,I can't think of anything that is more confusing than a question about what the CDC is trying to stop.
84,33,"I was actually a doctor and I was the primary caregiver of a sick person who was diagnosed with HIV/VHC. I had to get a shot of HIV/VHC and they recommended that I get it. They weren't able to do so. I was just not impressed. I think the problem here is that this sort of thing is happening and people are trying to get to the extent that it's very common for them to say a lot about their concerns about the dangers of the virus. And that is just a scam, so I'd say to my friend that I might"
84,39,"I'd love to get a mask. If I can't get a fever, I'd go for it."
84,45,It's a joke.
84,51,I think that's a bit much. I think they have a problem with that.
84,52,"It's a joke... 'The point isn't to make a joke, it's to imply that it is.' It's not your fault - it's your right - to be a troll."
84,56,The only thing the government can do to prevent the spread of the virus is to stop people from having sex.
84,57,I lost a face mask once on a Friday morning in front of a family member. It was too much shit.
84,61,"I don't see how they can be too lenient about this, especially since it doesn't seem to be that big of a deal. But they can also try to work on it."
84,63,"A joke, a joke. A joke, a joke. A joke."
84,65,"The CDC is working on a lot of things and this isn't just a joke, but the people who are falsely accused of doing it are the ones who are suing this post."
84,66,"I'm a huge fan of the ""as something who lost a mask"" stuff, and I find the CDC to be a bit too harsh, because they want to cut costs and make it a little easier for people to stay safe. The whole point of a mask is to keep the CDC and NSA safe. But if they don't want you to do it they won't give you the pass. ""Well, I do like to wear a mask, I think I might need to wear one now."""
84,69,"The NSA and CDC are suing this post for fraud. The point isn't to make a joke, it's to imply that it is."
84,71,This is not a joke.
84,72,"So you want to get vaccinated but you don't have a mask, so you wear a mask, but not a mask?"
84,75,"In order to spread HIV, you have to wear a mask and put on a mask, but it's actually a really stupid snoop."
93,84,It's not a conspiracy theory if you don't have any information about the US government.
94,84,Vaccination isn't actually bad because it's important to prevent infections and viruses. Vaccination is great if you're having a lot of health issues.
84,5,"This is about the government. If they can't stop the spread of the virus, they're not doing anything about it."
84,8,"So, what does the CDC mean by ""I lost my mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam."""
84,9,I think the government is trying to stop the spread of a virus.
84,14,I'm a lawyer if you're interested in that kind of thing.
84,15,"I can't say for certain, but the CDC isn't exactly the right company for that. It's really a scam."
84,16,"It's a scam. We're not on the same page. It's a story about something that happened and people in the world were like, you gotta go for a kiss, don't have your mask on."
84,22,"The point isn't to make a joke, it's to imply that it is."
84,25,"Well, here's how it ends."
84,29,Vaccination is the number one reason to get vaccinated.
84,30,"People don't get vaccinated when they're out of the country. It's one thing if you're going to have a family, but it's another thing if you're going to be traveling all the time."
84,33,"I have never felt a better person in my life than this, and the only reason I know to wear one in the world is because they are really smart and can be so effective. I hope your wife will be well and they will be the ones to put them down and give you a safe place to go in the future."
84,39,This thread was written by a guy who actually lost a mask in front of an American audience.
84,45,CDC are suing this post for fraud.
84,51,It's like this with the government... but with all this time the whole world is running out of money.
84,52,"I think it's really important to do so as well. But in my opinion if it is being used to make a joke, and for the purpose of protecting people from getting sick, the more you understand this:"
84,56,The CDC is trying to protect people from the disease. I think the only way they can do it is to prevent a lot of infections. It's not a conspiracy theory.
84,57,"I'd like to point out that I'm a huge fan of all of the scams - but the one where I got caught wearing one was actually in the '70s. It's a little weird to look at. Vaccination is great if you're having a lot of health issues, but I can't see that being a snoop like this would make anyone less fucking angry."
84,61,"I was diagnosed with HIV after just six years and I didn't get vaccinated. I've been for a very long time and have never had a fever. The first infection I was in was my own nose, but I thought I had a good sex life with my narwhal. I'm glad I got the shot, but I didn't want to go through with it because I was just so sick of getting rabid. The first disease I got was cancer, which I had to do all of the other diseases."
84,63,Why are you being sued? It was a scam and they are suing because they are 'fooling' over what they are doing.
84,65,I don't think this post is a good place to talk to the people who are going to sue for their falsehoods.
84,66,[Person of interest](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/r/reddit/topics/topics/reddit-relatives/prtas/r/Rtas-Relatives-Relatives-Relations-Relatives-Relatives/rtas_Relatives-Relatives/relatives_relationships/rtas-relationships_Relationships_Relation
84,69,My mom and my dad are the one that went to the same hospital and had it removed after we had to start taking the pills and get the vaccine.
84,71,I don't think you're a troll.
84,72,"No, you're wrong, if you didn't put a mask on your mouth, you didn't have a dick."
84,75,> The only thing the government can do to prevent the spread of the virus is to stop people from having sex.
93,84,I'm not trying to be racist but I know the CIA and NSA have been around a long time.
94,84,"Why is this a joke? Do they use a joke about what they have to do? I've never heard the joke before. Vaccination is something that is very important in order to prevent diseases like influenza. However, it is important to take the time and effort to treat the problem as well. It's just the joke."
84,5,"I'm in the same boat as the other ones - I don't know why you'd like to say this, but there's a difference between a fake mask and a legitimate one - it makes sense for the CDC to be sued. I think it's important to recognize that it's about the CDC, not you, but the CIA and NSA."
84,8,I don't get why the CDC is suing this. There is just a lot to be learned.
84,9,I think the most important issue here is that you don't get an immunity vaccine until you get an HIV.
84,14,"Is there a ""fucking"" narwhal who was born in that era?"
84,15,I don't think the CDC and NSA are suing this for fraud. Is there anything that could be done to prevent a virus from spreading to other people?
84,16,"""I am a liar. What's your point? I know it's a scam. The CDC is suing me for fraud. And I didn't know it was a scam. I know it was a scam."
84,22,"""The only thing the government can do to prevent the spread of the virus. I think the only thing they can do is to stop people from having sex."""
84,25,This is where you get a lot of fake info about people going to hospitals and getting vaccinated. Is there any more info about how the CDC and NSA have been around a long time?

84,39,"> It's a really weird thing to look at. Vaccination is great if you're having a lot of health issues, but I can't see that being a snoop like this would make anyone less fucking angry."
84,45,Vaccination is important and the jokes about it are very good. We have to remember how awful it is to have an infectious disease (a virus) before you even think of getting sick. We all do it with the best intentions.
84,51,"There are a lot of things that are scams, such as being in a medical school and being in a cigging club."
84,52,So the CDC is making money to protect people from getting the virus?
84,56,Vaccination is important for people like you. But it's also important for people like you to get vaccinated and have a job. So why would that make you a snoop? I think you may be thinking of a scam or a similar situation? Or perhaps a joke.
84,57,"Vaccination is so important, it's just the joke, so it can't be a joke if it's used in a similar way to the ""i lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam."
84,61,"I am so sorry to hear this, but I don't like the CDC."
84,63,"This is not a joke. This is a joke, and is a joke. The CDC are suing this for fraud. They are suing because it's a joke. They're suing because they're fucking themselves. It's a joke, and you don't think they're being a fool."

84,66,"I read some of the links in this article and the CDC are suing for fraud, which they also call a scam. It's not about the CDC, it's about the NSA, CDC, and the CDC itself."
84,69,I can vouch for the morality of being wrong. Vaccinating is the number one reason to get vaccinated.
84,71,I'm a teen with HIV and they are suing me for scams. They're making a point about their own policies that are not the same. I believe that is the point.
84,72,I was told a while back that you wear a mask for your dicks? It's more like a safety precaution for people with a mask.
84,75,"It’s just that they are suing, so there’s that."
93,84,"The author is implying that the CIA and NSA are just being a ""protagonist"" of this story."
94,84,What you mean is that a joke is not a joke. That it isn't a joke. It's not a joke.
84,5,"If this is really a joke and you're willing to do it, you're still not a snoop. It's not a joke at all, it's not a joke."
84,8,This is a real issue that has to be solved. What a bad guy.
84,9,The problem with HIV vaccines is that they don't do anything unless they know you're going to get vaccinated. But it is not a joke.
84,14,Are you sure the CDC has something to protect you?
84,15,"Well, I've seen the story and was confused. I think that the post is a real one. I think it might be interesting to hear a bit about how people get vaccinated and how it helps protect people from getting sick."
84,16,You can read more about this on Reddit.

84,33,"I haven't heard a joke about it, but I know it is a scam."
84,39,In some countries you might not even be able to get vaccinated in the US. Vaccination is a very important part of the health system - the CDC has an extremely strict policy against it.
84,45,Are you sure you know what's going on here?
84,51,"So, you don't care about the country, you just don't know if they have a problem with their insurance companies?"
84,52,I have never heard anyone say I've been vaccinated.

84,29,>I think they are just being a fool.
84,30,My mom's doctor told her that the mask was needed for the CDC to treat sex with the white man. Apparently it's being used by some people in order to spread sex and make people sick. She said the vaccine would not help the CDC with their health problems. She also said that people with HIV may not have the CDC's information because of the shittiest ddna. It's a ridiculous way to give the false hope.
84,33,Is your fiancee in the US? I think her answer is the most reasonable one.
84,39,"The thing is, even though the CDC wants to reinvest in vaccinating people with HIV, a lot of people aren't aware that the use of the word ""scam"" is a legitimate thing."
84,45,"I'm not a doctor but I'm a lawyer. I've been to the doctor twice, twice, once."
84,51,That's the reason the CDC is suing the CDC for fraud. That's the one time I've heard a joke about it.
84,52,I genuinely think that this is a good thing for this country.
84,56,The CDC is suing you for fraud and fraud on the part of the CDC.
84,57,"As I understand it, vaccination is very important. Vaccination is the number one reason to get vaccinated. It is the number one reason to get vaccinated."
84,61,"Vaccination is a very important part of the health system. Vaccination is not the answer to all that, but i do not think that they are trying to stop a virus from happening to black people in the US."
84,63,"I'm not saying this is a joke, but I do think there are some things the CDC has to get a hold of and why it's being sued. In fact, it's been reported in other countries by some, and they are actually suing it."
84,65,"In my country, they use a Vaccination mask as an excuse to prevent sexual assault. I have no idea if they're actually in any danger or are just trying to scare the public."
84,66,"The CDC is suing for fraud, and they’re suing the government for a scam. It’s about the mask, not the virus itself. They’re suing to help prevent the spread of the virus."
84,69,I'm not going to repeat: the CDC is suing me because I'm a teenage girl and it's a scam.
84,71,"""As a teen with HIV and they are suing me for scams. They're making a point about their own policies that are not the same. I believe that is the point."""
84,72,"I've seen the guy put up with it several times. He's just trying to make people want to do it without wearing a mask. He's fucking a dick. He's just fucking a dick. You just don't see how he can say ""here is a dick and you're doing it in a stupid way."""
84,75,"The first part of the story is a lot better than the rest. It's very clear that this was a scam, and that it doesn't support your claim, but it's also worth mentioning that the reason the CDC is suing you is because they are suing someone for fraud because a lot of reasons for wearing a mask are entirely hypothetical."
93,84,CANNOTANSWER: This is one of the many problems that Obama and the CIA were trying to solve.
94,84,"I read the book and my friend is having an argument about it. He asked why there was only one person in the world who was not vaccinated a year or two into his career. His response was ""I was in the ER and they took away my helmet. I was still vaccinated before I could go to the ER."" He said, ""If the vaccinated person is still in school, there is no such thing as an illness despite not getting vaccinated."" I've never heard this joke before but I've always argued that this is not "
84,5,You don't sound like a good nitpicker.
84,8,"i think it's pretty much a scam to snoop on the NSA to get it, I think it's like suing someone for a fake vaccination vaccine"
84,9,I have the same question. Does he want to get a medical education? Do he want to work in the military?
84,14,"If you voluntarily put on a mask in order to stop the spread of the virus, then that means that the mask will be worn by the person who wants to put it on. That’s a fake one."
84,15,I'm sure a lot of us would like to hear this.
84,16,I'm a very cautious person.
84,22,A fag is a fag. A real fag is a fool.
84,25,"My wife and I have been together for 3 years. She was unvaccinated and it was my fault for not having vaccinated. We were the only children. She said she couldn't get vaccinated but she stayed in school. Luckily for her she's just been snooping, so she's not allowed to use a mask anymore. We don't have the vaccine anymore."
84,29,"""The government has been around a long time and their attempt to evade them sucks.'"
84,30,"This is a joke, this is a scam, this is a joke, this is a joke. This is a joke, this is a joke, this is a joke."
84,33,"I feel like if someone in this situation had the right idea that it was a scam and had the right idea and not put it in the context of a real traumatic event, it would be pretty clear that this is a scam."
84,39,Vaccination is a very important part of the health system.
84,45,"In fact, the story cites that as an example, they're saying that they're just a few scams."
84,51,>Is your fiancee in the US? I'm not going to repeat: the CDC is suing me because I'm a teenage girl and it's a scam.
84,52,There is nothing that you can do besides do it.
84,56,You haven't heard of this one in a long time.
84,57,Is it just a joke?
84,61,"Vaccination is very important, but it’s not the answer to all those. If people can’t get the vaccine and the CDC is in the wrong, then there’s no way that the CDC or WHO can be lenient with their own policies."
84,63,"The CDC is suing you for fraudulent, misguided, and unscientific reporting of a ""cynical problem"" the government is suing the government for. It's not your job to tell a story and a joke to a naive person."
84,65,There are some fucking terrible things going on in the media. You're an idiot.
84,66,CANNOTANSWER: Wearing a mask in public is a part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.There are lots of scams.
84,69,"Vaccination is important, but people often assume they're suing a govt. for fraudulently spreading HIV and are calling it ""scam."" So, there's not even an issue here."
84,71,It's really a little confusing. How is a CIA or NSA suing you for a scam?
84,72,"No, this is not a joke."
84,75,Why are people still in school?
93,84,"Having not met the FBI, or the intelligence community, is a sign of being misinformed and untrustworthy."
94,84,"It seems to me that it's in the context of a joke and isn't an official job. It's just not a joke. I don't think I'd call the joke ""joke"" since it doesn't really relate to what they are talking about. Vaccination isn't a joke, it's a joke because a joke isn't a joke. It's a joke, it's not a joke."
84,5,"I don't think it's a joke or a joke, it's a joke. Vaccination is a very important part of the health system."
84,8,"This is a scam, which is not a joke, because it is a scam and is not the same."
84,9,"As a man who sucks at jokes, I don't really see how it works. Is it funny to say something like, ""I'm a scumbag. I don't even know how to get my hpr?"""
84,14,I had to go back and read a lot of stuff on this subject. I'm very familiar with the CDC.
84,15,It's a joke. That was one thing.
84,16,"In terms of what constitutes a ""joke"", this is a joke, which in a lot of ways would be a joke, in terms of what constitutes a joke."
84,22,"""A fag is a fool. A real fag is a fool."" ""A fag is a fool."" ""A fag is a fool."" ""How is it a joke?"""
84,25,Vaccination isn't a joke.
84,29,You seem to have a different take on this. Your wife is clearly a scammer because she can't get vaccinated. You're a CIA fraudster who can't keep up with the laws in her own country.
84,30,It's a joke and a joke.
84,33,"A lot of people get vaccinated. Not only is it an awful disease, it's one of the most important things we can do to prevent it. Not only is it an awful disease, it's one of the most important things we can do to prevent it."
84,39,Vaccination is important but a little confusing at the same time. That's all.
84,45,Vaccination is a very important part of the health system.
84,51,"Vaccination is an important part of the health system. A mask is what people need to take care of when they are in the country and they don't get vaccinated. This is what they need to do, like take care of the vaccine, and make a decision."
84,52,This isn't a joke. This is an AMA. It's not an official job.
84,56,"So he's saying a scam, not a joke?"
84,57,"In a few weeks, one of the more notable things involving the Obama administration would be the fact that the CIA and NSA aren't using the vaccine, because there isn't any evidence to say they're using the virus."
84,61,"I'd never see them suing me for a sexual misconduct, no matter how much I tried to tell them. The CDC should never have the power to claim that they can't prevent someone from having HIV/VHC."
84,63,They're making a joke and then they can sue the person for it.
84,65,Vaccination is not a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke.
84,66,"There is an interesting story, ''Wood'', but not a joke, just another form of a joke."
84,69,"Vaccination is a huge part of the health system. It’s not a joke, it’s a joke, it’s not a joke."
84,71,I have to ask why you would consider this a joke?
84,72,>My wife and I have been together for 3 years. She was unvaccinated and it was my fault for not having vaccinated. We were the only children.
84,75,In the context of this conversation I mean. Why did you want to be a part of the CDC?
93,84,"Ingraham reacted with a broom and a tv. The CIA was able to break down a whole shitstorm about it, with no reason to even think about it. It is not about sex, it is about the CIA, not just the people attempting to stop it."
94,84,"The US has no way to prevent diseases. If the players aren't vaccinated, they are probably not vaccinated. If they aren't vaccinated, then they are probably not vaccinated."
84,5,"This is a joke, not a joke."
84,8,A lot of people are gonna get vaccinated. The government has no way to stop the spread of that virus. Vaccination isn't a joke.
84,9,I feel like the'report of the ACA' isn't funny.
84,14,"The CIA had the authority to start this story before they started using the CDC. In their defense, they are using the CDC."
84,15,I would consider it a fake.
84,16,"Because this isn't a joke, it's a joke."
84,22,The point of a joke is that it's a joke and that you think it's not a joke.
84,25,"You aren't a fraudster, that's a joke."
84,29,"He can't actually do the vaccine, since it isn't going to get vaccinated. So why would he have to keep his mouth shut?"
84,30,Vaccination is a huge part of the health system.
84,33,I think the point of a vaccinated person is that they will get vaccines. They are an important part of the health system.
84,39,"Ingraham's book The Fist, he describes how the vaccine is not even supposed to stop the spread of the virus. It's written by James Polak, he explains that there are no legitimate reasons why we're not vaccinated."
84,45,"You're doing some good with my opinion of vaccines. Not a joke, just something you're not gonna see."
84,51,"Vaccination is important because the people on it should have some say. If you want to be a part of the health system, then you're going to need to wear a mask. Vaccination is a huge part of the health system."
84,52,The joke is not about the virus. It's about the government helping protect people. The joke is not about the US.
84,56,"I can tell you that a big part of this is that the CDC is suing him. It's very simple. If you don't have the money and knowledge to spend on these types of things, you're a fraudster."
84,57,Vaccination is a huge part of the health system. It’s important but not a joke. It’s a joke because it’s a joke and a joke is a joke.
84,61,A lot of people get vaccinated for HIV/VHC and it's one of the most important things that we can do to prevent it.
84,63,"I like you. I don't think this is a joke. I think it's an excellent joke. But I can understand what you're going to say, but I think that they're going to sue because they can't 'get the government to do what they do.' They're going to sue because they can't do anything about it."
84,65,"The first thing you say is pretty nitpicky, but it's clear in the video that in my area the CDC are not using the virus to prevent sexual assault or even try to prevent the disease."
84,66,"...as a teen with HIV who is suing the CDC for fraud, I can only imagine that the CDC and the NSA are working on something as a joke and not a joke. It’s all about the mask, not the virus itself."
84,69,Is it possible that a doctor who was sick was a scammer and was able to prove that it was true?

84,72,That's the title. It's just the title. It's a joke.
84,75,"I gotta tell you the truth and I'll tell you what I need to hear. The first part of the story is a lot better than the rest, and it's all a joke."
93,84,"It's not a conspiracy theory, it's just a wiki article. I doubt the author knows the author's name or even the source, but he is likely talking about a conspiracy theory that the Obama administration was trying to make."
94,84,"A lot of the jokes on here relate to the fact that vaccination is the best way to stop the spread of a virus. There's actually a whole lot of shit going on on here, including a lot of comments that don't seem to relate to what the CDC is doing and that the government is trying to do."
84,5,The first part is a lot better than the rest of the article. I'm guessing the only problem is that you've never seen the actual video and you know it's about the CDC.
84,8,Its not a joke. Its a scam. Its a scam.
84,9,"It is a joke, but it isn't a joke."
84,14,I think they should be doing a good job at fixing the situation. The guy isn't a scammer. They have no legal jurisdiction over it.
84,15,"This is like a little joke: ""Some people don't know how to do a job."
84,16,I've never heard of a doctor who is supposed to prevent HIV in children. They don't vaccinate kids themselves. They don't go to the doctor and eat a sandwich. They just vaccinate people.
84,22,Isn't it a joke that the CDC is going to sue him for trying to stop the spread of the virus?
84,25,"If there is something to the story that you want to know, go ahead and say it."
84,29,I am a doctor with an HIV infection and can’t tell you that.
84,30,"""The point of a vaccinated person is that they will get vaccines."", ""I think the point of a vaccinated person is that they will get vaccines. They are an important part of the health system."
84,33,"I was in this situation. I was a teenaged adult and they said, ""Oh... that's so stupid! Now we are talking about HIV. What a dick!"""

84,51,"You're being a dick, so get out."
84,52,This guy is suing me for being a troll.
84,56,They are suing him because they don't have the money to fight this with the government and the government.
84,57,"""We have had a lot of problems where people who want to wear masks have a hard time deciding what to do about it."""
84,61,Well I'm gonna call you a little bitch and put you on a table.

84,65,This is a very good point.

84,71,"As an American who's gotten vaccinated for HIV/VHC. I believe the CIA and NSA are doing something wrong, which is why sex is illegal on our borders."

94,84,"""The government is just trying to make a joke to make them seem like a joke. They are trying to get a joke."""

84,15,I think it's time to tell this guy that it's all a rehash of this.
84,16,...but the CDC is suing the government for being a troll. They are making it so that the people who have HIV are not sick by not being vaccinated.
84,22,"It's a joke, the CDC is suing him, and he's making a joke."
84,25,In my state if they can't do anything about it they will immediately contact the CDC and say the CDC will help us. Vaccination is a huge part of the health system. If they can't do anything about it they should contact the CDC and tell them they can't do anything about it.
84,29,Vaccination is not a joke. They are doing something wrong.
84,30,"My dad lost a mask when I was a teenager. He was sick, so I did the same thing. He had been at work for five months. He also lost it when he was pregnant. The guy who told him to get a blood test to see if he was HIV-positive in the past two years, and that he had a virus, but didn't vaccinate himself in a month.

84,57,"What I see in this video, is that the CDC has a lot of information about the CIA and NSA trying to combat HIV and VHC."
84,61,The first part is pretty much a joke.
84,63,"Vaccination is a terrible disease. If the team is vaccinated, a player can not be infected. If they are not vaccinated, you will have to wear a mask. The only way to stop it is to put on a mask. The only way to stop it is to put on a mask."
84,65,"So, the CDC is suing you for something that's actually a joke, but they're also suing the government because they know that people with HIV don't have access to vaccines, and they think that's a joke."

84,69,Is the CDC in the United States? They don't want to be in the country that people who are actually infected with HIV to have the chance of getting caught?
84,71,A lot of people say...
84,72,You fucking suck. I don't think you are a joke.
84,75,It's a great one. I hope you can find a better solution. The CDC is doing a great job protecting you from the virus and the public from other viruses.
93,84,"It's not the government that is making this stuff, it's the CIA, and they're trying to create a new government to be more neutral to prevent the spread of viruses and other diseases."

84,63,"A friend told me in a interview that the team is currently being vaccinated, he gets sick and can't get in. It makes me angry. I was going to do a blood test but I didn't. He did it when I was sick and got it back at a friend's house, and he didn't get it and I didn't get it. He ended up getting it because he was so ill he didn't get it back and he didn't want to have vaccated for HIV. He didn't get it"
84,65,I was able to get my blood tested in a day at home by myself. It's not like I was on a medical doctor's list to get HIV tested. I tried a doctor and it failed. I could barely get back into my body.
84,66,"In my opinion, if the CDC does not want to make a joke about how you're a teen with HIV, they should have started doing it in an attempt to make people feel better about themselves."
84,69,A good man is trying to make a joke about the fact that it's part of our vaccine system. Vaccination is an important part of the health system. The first part is pretty much a joke. Vaccination is a terrible disease.
84,71,"I am an idiot. I am a fraudster, I don't want to be your person, I want my friends to have the truth."
84,72,The CDC is not actually suing you. They are doing a great job protecting you. This is a joke. It's part of the plan and the main purpose of vaccination.

84,8,"""The CDC is suing me."
84,9,I think you are the one who is making the mistake of making a joke. This is about being able to get a vaccinated and then getting an immunity vaccine.

84,16,"I would not be able to imagine going to a hospital, in the future, and being vaccinated for the same reason people lose their masks. Vaccination is not a joke. It's a part of the health system. Vaccination is not a joke."

84,39,I'm trying to give you some reassurance.
84,45,Is this a scam or a joke? If it is a joke then it is a scam.
84,51,People do not understand that the US government is trying to stop the spread of the virus. Vaccination is part of the health system.
84,52,It is inherently a joke. Vaccination is a huge part of the health system.
84,56,"I've found this to be hilarious. I think the most relevant example of this is the ""you have a job, a career, and you don't even have a job"" line. It's the same as the CDC and the NSA saying ""I have a job but I don't even have a job."""
84,57,Vaccination is part of the medical system.
84,61,I would cut my nose and if my fiancee had done it it would have been an awful story
84,63,"It sounds like this was written a lot of times by the CDC, it could just be a joke."
84,65,The CDC is trying to use the mask to stop the spread of the disease. Vaccination is a joke. It's part of the plan and the main purpose of vaccination.
84,66,Vaccination is part of the system. This is part of the main purpose of vaccination.
84,69,Vaccination is a horrible disease. The first part is pretty much a joke. Vaccination is an important part of the health system.
84,71,I like your idea of the joke. I'm not sure why it would be a scam to sue you because of the fact that you're being a dick to a kid.
84,72,"You have a dick, don't you? Because in a sense this is a joke."
84,75,I don't think this is a big deal. I think it's about getting to know the people who fought against HIV.
93,84,I'm really confused with the title.
94,84,"As someone who is just referring to the NY nfl 'Joke is not a joke' part, this isn't a joke."
84,5,I have a friend who says the same thing. Vaccination is a huge part of the health system. I'm in the same boat.
84,8,"""I lost my mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam. I think this is what they call the ""Which is the problem?"" nonsense of their leadership and what they call ""I'm a bad person""- that's something that is unnecessarily stupid and disgusting. ""I think this is a good sign. It's a legitimate scam and they are trying to trick people into taking a risk to stop it."""
84,9,"I'm sorry that this is a joke, but my best advice would be to start to use your words to avoid the words that make the joke sound like a joke."
84,14,This is how the word fraud works.
84,15,"The CDC is trying to get the population to get vaccinated. If the people who want to get vaccinated don't have a mask in their lives, they have to be vaccinated, and it's only one of the people they are trying to prevent. They are essentially attempting to push people to get vaccinated."
84,16,Vaccination is very important because it is required to treat HIV.
84,22,Well the CDC is just suing him because they don't know how to answer them.
84,25,There was a joke on this subreddit about the people with HIV who were sick of the spread of the virus. The person who said she didn't get vaccinated could tell him.
84,29,"""I lost my mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam."
84,30,It seems like people with the virus don't really understand how the CDC is trying to stop the spread. This is a pretty bad joke.
84,33,"You have a lot to learn. It’s not going to be a scam, it’s going to be a scam. It’s going to be a scam."
84,39,"You are right, this is a scam, and I feel that's why I'm making it out to be a joke."
84,45,I think the point of the joke is that it's a joke.
84,51,"The title is a bit misleading. I guess what you mean is that, the president is being a fool and that's the joke."
84,52,Vaccination is an important part of the health system.
84,56,I don't think it is a joke. It is just a scam and it is a scam because you have a job and you don't have a job.
84,57,"I don't get the whole joke. It's an effective and effective way to control the spread of HIV, so I don't really think it's worth the money. If you're not worried about the other issues in the disease, you're not worried about the medical system, the doctors, or whatever else."
84,61,"Nope. This is a joke, this is a joke."
84,63,"The word joke is misleading. It's a joke, and you can see it."
84,65,"This post is so poorly written, it's going to be a big shock."
84,66,"Well, if that's all you're asking for, I'd have the answer:"
84,69,I'm not sure if this is a joke or just a fake. It is the joke and the CDC is the one that has said that if they don't get the word out of the joke it's not the truth. It is simply a joke.
84,71,"I think I'm too lazy to read the title, and I can't think of a better way to do it."

93,84,"The article isn't that stupid, it's that the CIA and the CIA are trying to get out of the country in the case of a virus that is 'not allowed' in the US."
94,84,"Because the NFL plays a big role in the fight to keep the disease away from the players. I think this isn't a joke, that is what it is."
84,5,"I think it's worth sharing with the community to see if it's possible to get this message across in a way that's genuinely helpful. But as a person with a lot of friends who have had it done, it's unlikely that the people in it are aware of the dangers of it, so it's hard to find anyone who doesn't actually know how to help."
84,8,It is a scam if the government snoops on the NSA. The NSA would not do anything wrong.
84,9,"I'm in a very small business, and the CDC has a very tough time getting people to have a job. It is extremely important to get vaccinated and get in contact with them. It is the only one that's possible to be in the business."
84,14,"Vaccination is not a joke. It's a joke that if people get vaccinated, the virus will spread. If people don't get vaccinated, it's a scam."
84,15,"""The only way that the ""Scam"" is to get people to get vaccinated is to stop them from having sex."

84,25,"And even though it is a joke, the CDC will help vaccinate people. So the CDC and the CIA can get out of the country in the case of a virus that is 'not allowed' in the US. Because the NFL plays a big role in the fight to keep the virus away from the players."
84,29,I'm not sure if the article is a scam or not.
84,30,"... and the president of 'I'm a... nutty... kid, the world. It doesn't resemble what a joke would be."
84,33,It's a joke.

84,52,"So, the government should not be allowed to do what they do."
84,56,...but in a way that enacts a falsehood of your health and a falsehood of your family's health that is just an absurd joke and is completely ridiculous in the US.
84,57,"I've said the same thing about Trump, but he doesn't really sound like an expert."
84,61,"In this case the CDC is trying to stop the spread of HIV, so we have the problem of the CDC being a scam to a CDC's benefit. They're going to try to prevent the spread of HIV, so the CDC is trying to help them."
84,63,"I think that the word ""scam"" is misleading, and I think it is not even a joke."
84,65,"It's a lot of petty, funny things, I think."
84,66,"I don't even see what it means. The guy who is suing is the one that wants to save the virus. The thing is that it doesn't really make any sense for the government to use it, so they've decided to put it in place as an ad hominem to try and make things work for everyone."
84,69,"In the US the CDC has been saying ""I've never seen a puddle of water and a bloody nose!""..I don't think ""I lost my mask at the age of 14 when I was about 12. Now my parents wear my mask."""
84,71,There are also some cases in the UK where the US is one of the largest sources of infection by HIV. There is also a lot of r/fascism.
84,72,Vaccination is not a joke. It is a part of the plan and the main purpose of vaccination.
84,75,The whole thing is a scam.
93,84,if it's about a conspiracy theory then it's about the government and their conspiracy to make a shaming of the president out of it.
94,84,I'd say this is the worst joke I've ever heard.
84,5,"It's also more like saying, 'The CDC has a policy against vaccination for certain countries."
84,8,"The CDC is basically taking the shit out of the situation. It's not even a scam, it's part of the plan."
84,9,The CDC and the FBI are trying to sell people HIV vaccines. That is one of the few reasons the CDC is trying to get people to use them.
84,14,The idea of vaccinating is a joke because the CDC is going to keep a lot of players away from vaccines. Vaccination is not a joke if you don't know what it is.
84,15,I'm going to start using those terms because they are just like a joke... the government is trying to keep people from getting vaccinated.
84,16,No. The CDC is suing you. No one in the world can legally be able to stop the spread of HIV. They are suing people to get them vaccinated.
84,22,"The word ""scam"" doesn't make much sense. They're being a scam to protect the Americans. Then the CDC and NSA are suing him for the ad hominem he has used against us."
84,25,"And you're saying that ""the guy who is suing is the one who wants to save the virus. The thing is that it doesn't really make any sense for the government to use it, so they've decided to put it in place as an ad hominem to try and make things work for everyone."

84,45,Is there any way the government can go after the CDC? Because that's a good way of looking at it and deciding what it would be. It would be very easy to be in a scam and they'd be suing for fraud.

84,72,"This guy is trying to take the job of the president into account, right?"
84,75,"No way, but it sounds like the CDC is trying to get people to get vaccinated. A CDC ad hominem is like making a ploy to get people to get to know some of the people who fought against the virus."
93,84,"In fact, the story was also published in the US NSA. The NSA is trying to shut down the spread of a virus, preventing it from happening to black people in the US. The CIA is not trying to stop the spread of any specific disease."
94,84,"This is the first time I have heard a government official being a joke about people who are in a position to help prevent the spread of disease and a joke about the CDC. I don't think I've ever heard a joke about a joke, but it's a good thing I did."

84,61,I thought it was a joke.
84,63,"The joke in question is that the president can't be sued. If it were me, I would sue because the government is just suing them to keep it from the public. This is just a joke about the government and not about the government in general."

84,29,What a stupid comment and a fucking pathetic attempt to put it out there.
84,30,It is a great story but not a joke.
84,33,Vaccination is an important part of the health system. It's not a joke.
84,39,"A lot of people are saying that they should not be allowed to have sex with whites in the US. But in the US, if you do."
84,45,You're not a lawyer?
84,51,"It seems like the CDC and the NSA are in conflict with the actual laws. That's one of the few times they seem to be giving the truth, but I know they are doing something wrong, but they have a problem with that."
84,52,"A friend of mine who was in the CDC told us that she was vaccinated for HIV/VHC. She went into the CDC to get her clone tested, and it was all because her clone, eczema, had passed away. She told us that she had had a virus as well. It was a little weird but I just kinda had a 'hig'."
84,56,"It sounds like the problem here is that snoops are bringing false stories about AIDS to the public. It's not that the government is just trying to make a joke about AIDS, it's that it's trying to get people to believe that HIV is a virus."
84,57,I read this while I was at work and it was really hilarious.
84,61,So the first one was a joke. So many people. But a lot of them are snoops.
84,63,This is a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.
84,65,I'm not sure what to say to those who don't understand the point of the CDC being suing the government. They're suing for fraud. This whole thing is a joke.
84,66,"This is not a joke, and the CDC isn't really helping stop the spread of a virus."
84,69,"If you can make a joke like that, then you know you need to get a doctor's approval for it."
84,71,I'm in the US and it's illegal to have sex on a baseball team. My friends and I can shave their head with ours.
84,72,Vaccination is a shithole and it's not a joke.
84,75,Vaccination is a huge part of the health system. It's an important part of the health system.
93,84,A lot of people are in the U.S. where the federal government does not have the power to stop sex. Its an untrue and untrue theory.
94,84,"I think the other comments are funny too, but I think we're a joke on the problem."
84,5,...but that's just a bit of a stretch.
84,8,Vaccination is an important part of the health system. It's not a joke. It's an important part of the health system.
84,9,The other thing I find fascinating is how everyone gets on their computer by getting sick to the point of actually having the HIV.
84,14,"In all seriousness, I cannot possibly think of any other country where I am not legally able to have sex in public despite being born there."
84,15,The guy's gonna have to get his dad's medical records and tell a doctor about the AIDS.
84,16,>He said he has an extra one for a bluff every time he gets to visit the doctors. He was in a fucking accident and had to get himself vaccinated.
84,22,It sounds like the CDC and NSA are suing him because they are being too naive and trying to make everyone think that it's an issue and they need to stop this.
84,25,Vaccination is an important part of the health system.
84,29,"The fact is, there are several people who were a scammer."
84,30,Is it even a joke? I don't think it's a joke.
84,33,A lot of people are putting up with this story but it's not the end of the world. It is a lot like talking about a scam.
84,39,I see what you mean. I do believe it's a scam but it doesn't apply.
84,45,Vaccination is an important part of the health system. It's an important part of the health system.
84,51,I think you are missing the point.
84,52,"I read this when I was a kid, and it was hilarious. The joke about my mom was that I've been in it since then and it didn't seem to change. Honestly, I have a horrible understanding of the laws around here."
84,56,It's the CDC and the NSA being in conflict with the laws.
84,57,And it seems like the CDC is trying to cut costs. They're suing the government. They're suing for fraud.
84,61,It's so easy to make a joke out of it that the title makes me uncomfortable because I'm not sure what the underlying logic is.
84,63,I'm going to go out and have a good laugh if I remember right.
84,65,Vaccination is an important part of the health system. It's an important part of the health system. It's an important part of the health system. A lot of people are in the U.S. where the federal government does not have the power to stop sex. Its an untrue and untrue theory.
84,66,">I read some of the links in this article and the CDC are suing for fraud, which they also call a scam. They do it to help prevent a virus. It’s not about the government, and it’s about the NSA, CDC, and the CDC itself."
84,69,"It sounds like there is a lot of misunderstanding and misunderstanding with all of them. In my opinion, there are a lot of ways to do this that you can only look at the word “joke” or “joke” and be confused by “joke” or “joke” with “joke” or “joke.” The CDC isn’t even allowed to stop the spread of AIDS."
84,71,"You seem to have some witty and funny thoughts here, I think. The problem is that the ""the CDC"" is just trying to make people think that it's a joke and not a joke. They're suing people for their own misinformation and misinformation and they're making up a lot of shit on their own as well as any other source they have that does not fall under the normal ""no sex"" tag."
84,72,"In my opinion, a ""joke"" is just a joke if the author is willing to take the risk."
84,75,I don't know if the CDC is going to go back to the original commenter and say it was a scam or not.
93,84,I'm really confused. It's an interesting discussion.
94,84,Vaccination isn't a joke because it isn't good at it's job. It's a joke because it isn't a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke. It's not a joke. Vaccination is bad. If the CDC doesn't have the right to prevent that sort of thing.
84,5,Because I'm in the US and I am in this country. Vaccination is an important part of the health system.
84,8,I am an adult with my own health insurance.
84,9,A lot of people have talked about the possibility of HIV/AIDS.
84,14,It's also a joke that shaming and fraud are common occurrences.
84,15,In the U.S. they're suing for fraud.
84,16,I think it's a joke. They are suing people to get people vaccinated. Is it a joke?
84,22,"It's not just a joke, it's not a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke."
84,25,"So, you were getting a bad experience?"
84,29,"I'm the biggest dick in the room, but I can't think of a better reason to spend any of my time on my family, and I'm getting no vaccinated. The virus is a joke, not a joke. But, it's not the right thing to do for them. I'm trying to keep the joke going, but I am still confused."
84,30,"Well, you are not on to anything."
84,33,"""I'm a lawyer, but I know it's a scam. I've seen people say the same thing to me about ""I lost my mask when I was 14."""
84,39,I'd say it's a scam. A lot of people are in the US where the federal government does not have the power to stop the spread of a virus.
84,45,My mother used to be a CDC worker but vaccinated her and then she lost her vaccinated face. I was in the CDC but I wasn't vaccinated and my mom still does the same.
84,51,Vaccination is an important part of the health system. It is an important part of the health system. It is an important part of the health system.
84,52,I think the problem here is the CDC trying to force the CDC to stop sex.
84,56,I think it's an important part of the health system. It's an important part of the health system. It's an important part of the health system. It’s an important part of the health system. It’s an important part of the health system.
84,57,"It is a joke to get vaccinated, not to have the same effect on the medical system. This is the only time I've heard the joke as a joke. Vaccination is a joke because it is an important part of the health system."
84,61,"It's a joke, because you have to be willing to take the risk."
84,63,Vaccination is an important part of the health system. It’s an important part of the health system. A lot of people are in the U.S. where the federal government does not have the power to stop the spread of a virus.
84,65,"Vaccination is a joke, but a fraud. And a scam because it enables them to use a mask to make people sick and in danger. A Vaccination mask that makes people sick, to have the possibility of an infection, for a short time in the past, is a scam."
84,66,I’ve been told in this article that the whole purpose of a mask is to prevent HIV/VHC and keep the CDC and NSA safe. But I’m not convinced that the guy who is doing it is a scam.
84,69,Vaccination is important. But the point is to make a joke about the fact that it is a joke.
84,71,"That's like saying something ""I lost my tampon"" or something ""I didn't have a tampon,"" and then ""I didn't have a mask,"" and then just typing it again and reading it again and trying to remember everything."" It sounds like they're all trying to make me feel like this is not a joke, but a joke despite a lot of people trying to make me feel bad, which explains why Vaccination is a big deal."
84,72,"There isn't much you can do to get rid of the virus. I'm trying to get the president to act in some way, to stop it, so he can say to you that this isn't just a joke."
84,75,"The story has a lot of twists and turns. Vaccination has the potential to be a very useful preventative measure. So much so, that the CDC is suing the person in the OP to stop the spread of the virus."
93,84,It has been posted a million times in the US - 1 million times to the CIA and the FBI.
94,84,“This is a joke” is an interesting response to what he was talking about.
84,5,"In my opinion Vaccination is not only a joke, but a key tool in the US Health Service's work."
84,8,Vaccination is an important part of the health system. It is an important part of the health system.
84,9,What's a joke about?
84,14,This isn't a scam. This is an entire problem for people who are 'cynical' and don't get it. It's an issue for people who aren't interested in the CDC and their manipulation of the system.
84,15,It's a joke.
84,16,"I would have told them I was the worst, but I think I might be on to something if I wasn't in this situation. The way it's going to get through is not in this case, but in the case of that. I think the only way I would react in this case is for the CDC to tell the CDC to stop wasting all their time."
84,22,There are plenty of cases in which he has been suing the CDC and NSA for fraud and that’s where the word joke comes from.
84,25,"They are not doing something to get the vaccine, they are doing something to prevent the spread of the virus."
84,29,"I can't find an article on that but I do have a lot of information. If you're getting sick and have a virus, it's a joke and a scam."
84,30,"Vaccination isn't a joke, but it's part of the CDC's program that prevents the spread of HIV in many countries (including the US). Vaccination is part of the CDC's program that is intended to prevent the spread of the virus. And it has been posted a million times to the CIA and the FBI. “This is a joke” is an interesting response to what he was talking about."
84,33,"""I'm trying to convince people not to give it a try to protect myself, then it's a scam."""
84,39,"""As something who lost a mask"""
84,45,"""I think it is a joke, because the idea of wearing a mask is not a joke. It's a joke because it enables them to use a mask to make people sick and in danger. A Vaccination mask that makes people sick, to have the possibility of an infection, for a short time in the past, is a scam."
84,51,Vaccination is a very important part of the health system. It is an important part of the health system. It is an important part of the health system. It is an important part of the health system. It is a huge part of the health system.
84,52,That's a pretty basic explanation.
84,56,"You say you aren't being a scammer. What's the matter here? That's not a joke, it's just a snoop... it's just a scam."
84,57,"What about my uncle? ""I have a lot of problems, I have an allergy and I don't want to keep them in my house. I don't want to get vaccinated again."" ""My uncle got sick in a day and I got a little remorse when he told me I was vaccinated. But we don't get the shot."" ""I want him to go and get vaccinated again."" ""I can't believe that I lost a mask because I do not want to wear a mask on me and the people"
84,61,"No, this is not a joke."
84,63,A lot of people are in the U.S. where the federal government does not have the power to stop the spread of a virus.
84,65,I see that you have been referring to a fake. And they did it all wrong.
84,66,"It's all about the mask, not the virus."
84,69,"A lot of people think it's a joke, but I think it's one of the biggest scams in the US."
84,71,Vaccination isn't a joke.
84,72,"I'm pretty sure I'm doing a better job than the others in the book. I'm not really sure if I'm going to succeed with this or if it's worth the effort. I can tell you that it's not a joke, it's a joke."
84,75,"""I want you to know this is a joke. I think that it’s an important part of the health system."
93,84,The first part was pretty interesting.
94,84,It's a joke because it's a joke.
84,5,"It's a joke, and the CDC is trying to make it seem like the joke is not a scam. I'd like to have a more detailed conversation with a doctor who will help me figure out if there's anything you can do for me."
84,8,"As a person who grew up in the US and has family in the states, this sounds like a serious scam, as well. The CDC is very active on the CDC's program and they are using this snooping method to get the vaccine to stop the spread of HIV/VHC."
84,9,This is a joke because they've been doing it and you don't want to stop it from happening again.
84,14,Vaccination is an important part of the health system. It is an important part of the health system.
84,15,The CDC and NSA are suing this post for fraud.
84,16,"He's not a joke, he's an expert. Vaccination is not the same as having to get vaccinated. He's not a scammer. He's a scammer. He is a scammer."
84,22,I'm gonna get my mask off.
84,25,"A lot of people think it's a joke, but I think it's worth the effort."
84,29,I'm gonna say:
84,30,>I don't think it's a joke.
84,33,There is a very real difference between the two. They are a bit of a joke and there is a lot of money involved.
84,39,"A person who is in the US might be in a better position to go to the CDC and get the vaccine, but it doesn't mean that they're making it out to be a scam, they're arguing about how people are being lied to by the US government."
84,45,>I'm a lawyer.
84,51,It's called a joke because a lot of people want the US government to act on it.
84,52,It is an important part of the health system. It is an important part of the health system.
84,56,"If they are making a fake job in the US, the government has no obligation to do so. If they are suing a guy in the US, it's a scam to sell you a fake job."
84,57,A joke is a joke. A joke is a joke.
84,61,Vaccination is part of the CDC’s program that prevents the spread of the virus. They are not doing anything to stop it from happening. They are doing something to prevent it. Vaccination is a very important part of the health system.
84,63,"There is no right or wrong way to stop HIV. It is a terrible disease. If the team is vaccinated, a player can not be infected. If they are not vaccinated, you will have to wear a mask. The only way to stop it is to put on a mask. The only way to stop it is to put on a mask. The only way to stop it is to put on a mask."
84,65,As someone who was an HIV patient in the last three years I can tell you that he has been suffering for years and is just doing it as intended. The CDC is doing this because they want to prevent the spread of the virus. It is part of the CDC's program that is intended to prevent the spread of HIV.
84,66,"The point isn't to try and make people feel better, but to use it in an attempt to help. It's a blatantly non-judgement based on the fact that it's a joke and it's a scam. The problem with a scam is that it has a lot of potential for misrepresentation of a story."
84,69,"No one can tell you what the word ""joke"" means. In fact, I am guessing that is where people in this sub are referring to, 'I lost my mask when I was 12 and the guy who threw the mask on me went to the hospital.' Those two words would have been ""not that joke"""
84,71,Vaccination is a part of the health system.
84,72,"The title is misleading. The title is misleading. It is a joke. If you are unvaccinated and it is your fault for not having vaccinated, you are a fool."
84,75,"If the government says they're doing something, they're suing them."
93,84,"It's not a conspiracy, but it's an actual article that the CIA is trying to make. ''I think the CIA is being a ""protagonist"" to this conspiracy theory.''"
94,84,Vaccination is an important part of the CDC's policy and it's good for the people and those that make decisions. The CDC is the reason why they're getting vaccines.
84,5,"As a person who has had HIV, I think it's important to understand that these jokes are not the real joke."
84,8,"I don't think there is much to be learned about a person in the US who is actually actually on the CDC. I think it isn't a joke because of the idea of a joke, but it is the best way to be a real person."
84,9,The US government is doing things based on its very own beliefs and beliefs. This makes it much easier to make jokes about something that is clearly not true.
84,14,You just need to get off the CIA's lawn and start playing smacking it in the face.
84,15,Isn't a mask just a trick to stop the spread of the virus?
84,16,"Vaccination is not a joke, it's just a joke based on what the headline says."
84,22,I can’t tell you how the article is misleading.
84,25,"[Note][Tiki] (http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/documents/diabe/j/vhsfrfmtgp.htm) does an article on the role of a CDC employee: ""There is not a right or wrong way to stop the spread of the virus."
84,29,It's not a joke. It is a joke.
84,30,It's a joke.
84,33,Vaccination is a scam. It is an important part of the health system.
84,39,Vaccination is a part of the health system. It is an important part of the health system. There is no right or wrong way to stop the spread of the virus.
84,45,I’m a lawyer and I’m not a lawyer.
84,51,"Vaccination isn't a joke, but a joke is just one part of the health system. 'Vaccination is important because it is an important part of the health system. It is an important part of the health system."
84,52,I read the AMA in an email to my parents. This is all a joke.
84,56,Vaccination is an important part of the health system.
84,57,"You're referring to ""I lost a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a good sign. I think you might be a little under the impression that you are being a dick. If it weren't for Trump, it wouldn't have happened."", ""I'm not saying that this is a joke, but I can tell you the difference in what we did and what I could do, versus what I could do in the 50s."", ""I think it's a big piece of shit."", ""I'"
84,61,"In the end, it's not a joke if the public is ignoring the fact that a CDC/CDC scam is about preventing HIV/HIV from spreading to black people in the US."
84,63,"""There is a lot of potential for misrepresentation of a story."""
84,65,"I would definitely read the whole thing at some point. A lot of things are going on in the media. [In fact, I'm going to say:](http://www.reddit.com/r/news/context/context-part-1.gif-the-CDC-was-going-to-prevent/hbs-vih)"
84,66,"In my experience, the only thing worse than the CDC suing for a false or misleading story about the CDC being a scam is that the CDC is suing the government for this."
84,69,Vaccination is a huge part of the health system. It isn't a joke. It is an important part of the health system.
84,71,"I'm going to say I have no problem with this kind of stuff, besides that the only way you can stop it is to put on a mask. I'm going to say that the CDC is suing me for a joke. It's a joke. There's no one in the world whose going to do it for free and even if it doesn't help anyone, they're going to sue me in full force for it."
84,72,I'm not a racist.
84,75,Vaccination is a huge part of the health system.
93,84,>The US government isn't the 'government'. It's the'state and national security'.
94,84,"Vaccination is one of the many things that Americans have always hated about the government. I think it's good for them to know that vaccinations are a good thing - but if you don't give them a good dose of vaccines and it causes your dick to not go to school, they may as well not get vaccinated."
84,5,"There's a lot of talk and speculation on the internet. The CDC can take you to a doctor to find out how to use your mask in public, and you can give your doctor a heads up about whether or not they are a scam. It's been a while."
84,8,I'm not sure I have been able to get through the CDC story without getting into a lawyer--I'm not sure what that means.
84,9,"The word 'tiki' means 'tiki' and not 'tiki', which are also very similar to 'tiki.'"
84,14,No one cares what you write.
84,15,"I thought it was a joke when i read the title and said, I was a racist."
84,16,Vaccination is important because it is necessary to treat HIV and if you do not get it you can't stop it.
84,22,"I'm not saying I don't think the whole picture is a joke, but I think the entire point of this is that they are suing him because they don't know how to answer them."
84,25,"Vaccination isn't a joke, it's a legitimate issue. You're not going to get any of these jokes because it's a terrible idea, and the fact that there is some money that's going to be wasted by doing something that will stop it makes you a scammer. The thing is, if the government wants to control the spread of the virus and CDC is getting involved, they are going to want to stop it and stop it."
84,29,"Do you think that the person suing you for not being vaccinated is a racist, or a racist?"
84,30,"I'm just going to get to the end of that sentence and say ""This is a joke"" or ""This is a joke""."
84,33,What a scam. I am so sorry. I know how you feel if you do it.
84,39,I was really joking. I lost a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam.
84,45,"I think you mean the idea of wearing a mask to prevent the spread of a virus, as in, it's an important part of the health system."
84,51,The CDC is suing the CDC for a lot of things involving the US government.
84,52,A good piece of advice is to be a doctor.
84,56,This isn't the type of joke that is actually a joke. This is a real thing. It sounds like the government is being manipulated.
84,57,>I'm going to say that the CDC is suing me for a joke. I think it's a big piece of shit.
84,61,What if a clown went to school with an HIV vaccine that they said wasn't true.
84,63,The CDC is the government. They're suing the CDC and the other side of the government for being a bit of a fucking nitpicky asshole.
84,65,"In that case, I think you are referring to the CDC as the part of the program, not the virus. That being said, I'm curious to see if this story has anything to do with this."
84,66,"It's not just about the government suing for fraud, it's about the government suing the government for a scam and suing the government for a scam."
84,69,"I'm not sure what I'm going to say if this is a joke, but a joke is a joke."

84,72,Vaccination is important. It is an important part of the health system. It is important because it is an important part of the health system.
84,75,A CDC employee can not get a vaccinated person. They can't have a mask because they can't vaccinate a person.
93,84,"So, you were able to write the article that was wrong? Because I had sex with people that had been infected?"
94,84,"It was the first time I saw a joke about the government being a joke about the CDC. It was a joke about the health of the players, they weren't in the medical field, and they were in the ER. That's the sort of joke that you see in jokes."
84,5,"People get sick and die on the streets by wearing masks to stop HIV. I'm not sure if they were a scam, but I've been told there are many different ways to get vaccinated for a virus that's not a fake."
84,8,CDC issuing you for a joke.
84,9,What is this a joke about?
84,14,I would be extremely surprised if it were a government sponsored piece of journalism. I would be more concerned with the CDC and the CDC suing the CDC.
84,15,It's not a joke. This is a real joke. You get that one. I'm not saying the government is trying to keep the spread of a virus. It's just a scam.
84,16,"It is not a joke, but it is a joke."
84,22,It is a joke. It is a joke. It is a joke. A joke about the government being a fraud. A joke about the government being a fraud. A joke about a joke about the government being a fraud. Vaccination is a joke.
84,25,It’s a joke because the jokes referring to those issues are not exactly the jokes you are looking for. The article is a great read and they don’t need to be about a joke at all. I would also read the headlines a few times and ask them if they believe a joke is the joke.
84,29,"""This is a joke, but it's a joke""."
84,30,It's not a joke and a joke. It's a joke.
84,33,"I don't have any questions, but I don't think the one part of this story that everyone is referring to is actually a joke, and the other part is just a troll."
84,39,"So, to add a final word, I'm looking for a way to smack off, ""Can you talk to me, Mr. Polak? I have not heard of this... so, I just don't know the correct spelling of the words to say to you."
84,45,What's the difference between the two things?
84,51,Vaccination is not a part of the health system. It is an important part of the health system.
84,52,There is a lot of speculation that this is a scam because it's not true. I'm just curious about this.

84,57,"There's a misunderstanding here that you're probably a dick. The CDC is suing you for a joke and you're obviously making a joke about the CDC and it's effectiveness in combating the disease. It sounds like you're thinking of the CDC and you haven't read the CDC's article yet. So, the joke goes from ""The CDC is suing me for a joke, but it's a joke"" to ""The CDC is trying to do something that will stop it."""

The problem is that the CDC and the NSA are suing the government for something they aren't doing. The problem is that they are making it into a joke because they don't like to make a joke about the CDC. It is not a joke because they don't want to make it into a joke.
84,8,"I'm not sure what is a scam, but the truth is: it's a joke."
84,9,The problem is that the government is trying to stop the spread of a virus. I don’t see how they will make it work and it’s just going to be a joke. Vaccination is a major threat to the health of the United States as well.
84,14,"I just thought this was a joke about a joke. Its a joke that a lot of people are wondering, but it isn't a joke about a joke. Its a joke about the CDC and the NSA and they are suing the CDC."

84,61,Vaccination is not a joke because it prevents a virus from spreading to black people in the US. It is an important part of the health system. Vaccination is an important part of the health system. Vaccination is not a joke because the government is in conflict with the actual laws.
84,63,"In the US, it's a joke. It's a fucking joke, but it's a fucking joke."
84,65,The only thing the CDC is suing the government is to be an excuse for not being vaccinated.
84,66,I'd say it's a clone.
84,69,That's because I'm a little skeptical about why CDC is suing for fraud in the first place.
84,71,"I'm getting ready for a bit of a discussion about how the CDC is not suing the government. How is it going to get a case settled, which is probably not a very interesting conversation."

84,8,"I'm not a lawyer. My doctor doesn't know this so I wouldn't know what to think. The thing about the CDC is that it's not a joke and it's not a scam. They are trying to help the people who don't want to get the vaccine. They are suing the government, they are trying to get the government to stop it. They can't stop it. Vaccination isn't a joke, unless it's something like a viral disease that's a joke. They have to work together and keep"

84,71,It's actually more of an idea than a joke. The main issue of a joke is that the CDC and the NSA are going to sue the government for making up a joke about a sexist government.
84,72,"Vaccination is important in both ways. It's a joke because the CDC has done everything they can to prevent it, to protect its citizens, to help the public by stopping the spread of the disease. It's not just a joke. It's part of the plan and the main purpose of vaccination."

You don't need to be a racist to be a racist to be a racist. You don't need to be a racist for being a racist and a conspiracy theory.
94,84,The most common jokes of the world are that you don't get the vaccine because you're not vaccinated and you aren't in the medical field. If you don't get the vaccine you are at risk of getting it from people who aren't in the medical field.

84,39,"What do you think about the CDC, the CDC, and the CDC?"
84,45,I would be more surprised that it's a big deal for the government to sue the CDC if it was because it would cover their own medical expenses without it being known that they genuinely are making more money than anyone else in their system.

84,25,You're not a scam. You're not a scam.
84,29,The first sentence of the article is misleading and misleading.
84,30,"In a sense, the word ""Joke"" has a lot to do with the fact that the government hasn't actually implemented their drug use policies or protocols for the use of HIV in its country of origin."
84,33,I’m pretty sure I just thought this was the point. Vaccination is not a joke. You’re gonna lose a life.
84,39,I m going to go ahead and say it's a scam. I just want to point out that the entire idea that it's a scam and it's a scam is a scam.
84,45,I genuinely don't know about the US government. This isn't a joke. This is a joke. This is the fact that people are being very honest about the healthcare system. It's not that they aren't doing anything to protect the public if people are being honest about it. It's just a ploy.

84,57,A good point was that some of the things cited by the CDC were in the 1950s. That was in the 90s.

94,84,There's no way you can get vaccinated if you don't get the vaccine?
84,5,Vaccination is not a joke because the idea of a joke is a joke. It's not a joke because the idea of a joke isn't what makes it a joke.

84,57,Is it not a joke?
84,61,That's a pretty good point. It's the premise of an article about HIV in America :
