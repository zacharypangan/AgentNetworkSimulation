70,63,"I think the real story is that in 2009, the president decided not to wear a mask. They made it so that people could see he was infected and if they didn't, the president would retaliate and use it to spread a virus. In this case, he had to wear a mask that was a lot more effective to spread a virus."

84,63,"It's the CDC scum that gets the government doing what they do. But, this is the problem they're getting out of the way. They will be trying to stop people from using these masks, but they can't."
89,63,I have been to the CDC a few times and it sounded like a good idea to ask someone if they have any questions. I don't know what that means.
101,63,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
63,62,It's interesting how the CDC has decided not to put in a mask because that would result in a death in the eyes.

84,63,There's an AMA about this right here where it says that this is actually a joke from someone who was vaccinated for HIV/VHC.
89,63,The whole thing is a joke. The CDC is suing a savage because the government has given them immunity and they feel a 'right' to make it look like they want people to wear masks and to do so. The CDC doesn't have the right to make that statement or to deny it as a joke.
