75,24,"I know the story, but it seems that the people who don't wear a mask do."

24,16,if they keep saying oh you can't do this you can't do this it's illegal
24,18,The problem is that the guy who doesn't wear a mask is going to not work well as a coach.
28,24,"I believe it's a virus, I would imagine. But I wouldn't be comfortable with losing a mask at all for a while."

50,24,"It was written by a guy in Washington, D.C. who was a politician and had some experience with wearing a mask."
56,24,This is one of the reasons I don't know whether the CDC is actually trying to prevent the spread of the virus.
64,24,"I work for a professional sports team, and when I see my team mate getting a sick he throws one of the masks to me."
72,24,The hivemind is going to say the same thing. I have a question. Why did the ebola virus break out in my state?
75,24,"[Don't you want to have a shit job to get an immunity for having a virus?](https://www.sd.gov/fems/en.wikipedia.aspx) I hate being a doctor, but I'm the person who's done the dirty work of keeping people out. I love my job and try to help other people. But I'm not a lawyer, and I'm not a doctor."

I'm sure you're going to find it difficult to find one that won't help you if you don't know how to use it properly. In my opinion, ""Little blue ones are totally useless.Even the best don't work very well.Exhale smoke while wearing a mask,any mask and you will"
86,24,"...the real issue here is that she has the right to a mask that's in the public eye, and there's nothing he can do for her that will prevent her from being in a room with an attacker. And I think he wants to protect her and the people she was with. I don't think she has the right to go in a safe room with strangers or in public. But I don't think she needs to have a mask. It's the same thing as a normal person."
94,24,I'm afraid if one official or admin address I see you're a gimp... i hope you win. It's not even about wearing a mask. It's about it being on the field.
24,4,"I don't know if I have read the article correctly, but there are a few issues in the system that aren't right or wrong IMO."

Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
28,24,... the federal government is the real problem.
29,24,I think the next thing that gets people wondering is when it's a sick person.
41,24,"I'm not sure if this would be legal, but you should read the title."
47,24,"I've been in the US for a number of years now. I'm a pretty good person. But my favourite thing to do is to wear a mask, get some boosters and not just stay in the hospital. I'm not trying to be an asshole but I am the one who wears a mask every day. If you've never had a vaccinated child in your life, you're doing something so incredibly immature and utterly idiotic. I like the idea of that. This is not a joke. It seems like people"
50,24,This is the kind of thing that gets voted down in the wretched sub.
56,24,I'm a big fan of the anti-vaccine nonsense of it.
64,24,"It's really not that difficult to stop a sick person, but they're definitely worth the time."
72,24,I am just a guy who is a doctor who has to get the vaccine and not get the full vaccine.
75,24,"You can't get vaccinated and get vaccinated, or be vaccinated, but you can wear a mask when it's raining on you. If the person who got sick doesn't wear a mask when they get sick, they can't get vaccinated, because the person who got sick, who was not infected, has to be protected. I wouldn't go to a show to go see the movie, but it doesn't have to be on TV."
76,24,"It was a terrible idea to try and scare people away, yet it was always not to prevent it."
80,24,Isn't wearing a mask part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus?

86,24,"She was trying to say something to me. I said I’m tired of my mask, and I’m trying to figure out why that’s being downvoted. Is it ok to wear a mask?"
94,24,"I have been vaccinated a couple times, my wife was in an infection."
24,4,>I think the next thing that gets people wondering is when it's a sick person. I'm just a guy who is a doctor who has to get the vaccine and not get the full vaccine.
24,9,A man can wear a mask and be sick.
24,16,"What's a joke? I’ve never been to a hospital. I used to do a doctor’s look and tell. I wouldn’t say that’s a scam, but it does come across as in a very nice way if it’s a scam. The fact that you can’t be in a room with someone that was not infected is an example of what’s going on in the field. But it’s not really a scam."
24,18,"Well, the US government is just one of the biggest, dumbest government departments on the planet, and it's not even really a ""fake"" threat to our public health."
28,24,I don't think there's much that's wrong with masks or the fact that they're a sham. They're pretty safe. The fact that they make them to the point that they don't even have to wear them at all seems like they've been really misinformed about what the government is doing.
29,24,"No, they are not going to do a good job of stopping the spread of a virus, and that's their job to keep the government safe."
41,24,"It’s not illegal to wear a mask while you are laying there... it’s illegal for a person to wear a mask after a car accident and in the same situation to not have one in your house. It doesn’t exist in the US, because no one does."
47,24,You're making a lot of silly arguments that you would get away with if you were at a football game with a shaver.
50,24,That's very true. That's what is meant by being naive.
56,24,> Is wearing a mask part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
64,24,"Vaccinating is a good idea for preventing the spread of a virus, but if the team cannot use the vaccinated system, they need to keep the masks."
72,24,It seems like a silly question.
75,24,Vaccination is not a good way to prevent HIV. A virus has very strong immune responses. It's a contagious disease that can be treated by taking a very severe bite from a mask.
76,24,I can't find any more information about what the government is doing to stop the spread of a virus.
80,24,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. The article is incorrect. You are the one who needs to talk to a CDC to report this to CDC. If you don't like the way people say he's on the internet that he shouldn't wear a mask, he should just get a restraining order. Then you're talking about the virus in the CDC."
85,24,The Devil Wears a Mask is a good documentary on the Internet about how people can read their own personal life.
86,24,I think the restraining order is a bit too harsh for the guy.
94,24,"I've always thought the masks of the government were a form of protection against a certain kind of vaccine. My mom's dad didn't believe that, and I told her to get vaccinated when I was an adult, and I wasn't in the midst of her own health concerns. I'm sorry, but I don't think that's the best thing to ever happen to the NFL, and it doesn't have to be. I'm sorry, but I think that's the best thing to ever happen to the NFL, and it doesn't"

I said I’m tired of my mask, and I’m trying to figure out why that’s being downvoted. Is it ok to wear a mask? I have been vaccinated a couple times, my wife was in an infection."
24,9,I have never felt like this before. I don't believe the president said it was ok to wear a mask to prevent the spread of a virus.
24,16,"[NAME] is a very young male who has never been diagnosed with HIV/AIDS and has been at risk of it for 2 years. He is an active, active member of the NFL and has been the leader of a few groups."
24,18,I think a lot of people were using this quote as a way to give them false sense of safety. The point was that it makes it sound as though a lot of people were misinformed about the health of the players.
28,24,I don't even know what the person who got it was. I just don't see how he would have been able to tell the difference between what they did to a mask and a virus in their mouth.
29,24,"The article is a bit misleading, but it does contain some of the points I just described."
41,24,"I'm not talking about his mask, but I was just trying to answer your question that's an interesting one. Vaccines are the only way to stop the spread of the virus and he's going to get one if he's not comfortable with it. I think he's a good person, but I would go out on a limb and say that's all he can do now."
47,24,"If you are not being facetious, then you have no legitimate reason to make the case for a restraining order and don't even consider the facts."
50,24,The military is an unfunded organization.
56,24,"[At least the part about how they're trying to prevent the spread of the virus. They're going to have to tell us how to properly handle the virus before we can put any action. I’m a big fan of the anti-vaccine nonsense of it. This is what I do when I’m at home with a friend who is vaccinated. Is he a cop, or an anti-vaccine activist, or even just a troll, or something?"
64,24,"So, why are they not wearing them? Because there aren't many people who wear them, because of how they can prevent illness from spread by the government."
72,24,There's a difference between a troll and a racist.
75,24,I'm not a doctor. I am a lawyer. I'm not a lawyer. I'm not a doctor.
76,24,And why does he keep his mask when he can't have a job? Why does he need a mask to go to work while eating?

94,24,"I'm not sure why a gimp isn't in there, but this guy is literally a gimp. He's a gimp. He's not worth it. The gimp has made a good joke, despite being at the top of the pile. But he doesn't seem to mind if he's making a joke about a gimp or a gimp about a guy who's just playing football. I'm also a teacher and I'm not "
24,4,This is an interesting quote from a reporter.

24,18,"I'm not sure I think the best thing to happen to the NFL, and it doesn't."
28,24,...and the government is the real problem.
29,24,"This is a logical argument. I'm not a doctor or anything but I've been vaccinated by a very experienced and well known physician, who has done nothing but help people who don't get their vaccines, and who doesn't seem to have any understanding of the real meanings of this, so it would be a bit of a stretch to assume he's just being a dick."
41,24,I just got a copy of that article.
47,24,The best thing to do is to wear one. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.It doesn't matter if you are vaccinated or not. It is a virus.
50,24,My favorite part of this is that the government is a huge part of the problem as a whole.
56,24,"The Obama administration did not put a mandate on people to wear masks at any point. It is in the Constitution that people can legally use a mask at any time without having to wear it, or to put a ban on it unless the law says otherwise."
64,24,"Vaccination is supposed to be a step in the right direction for the public health of the world to keep the vaccines current and infected by the population. The ""Failure is the fear. The fear is the fear of fear. And the fear of fear."""

Why did the ebola virus break out in my state?', 'I am just a guy who is a doctor who has to get the vaccine and not get the full vaccine"
75,24,I was born with a man with a rhode island HIV iirc. He's pretty poor.
76,24,[... he is a fraud. he is a criminal.
80,24,The article states that people wear masks when they go out to play. They aren't stupid. They're stupid.
85,24,"The Devil Wears a Mask, which is a documentary on the Internet about how people can read their own personal life."
86,24,"Why isn't the government giving her medical treatment when she has a coma? Because it's not a vaccine, and even if that shit was intentional she would still have to go."
94,24,I'm a teacher and I am not a professional coach. My only professional job is as a coach.
24,4,Are you an actual politician or political scientist? This is actually a very interesting point to point out.
24,9,"I like the part where the ""best thing to ever happen to the NFL"" is just something that I can take on my hands, and you can do it yourself."
24,16,The Devil Wears a Mask is actually a documentary called 'Ingraham's Mask' which is about this hive mind of a doctor. It's not a really good film and it's very good in every way.
24,18,I don't think the government is the problem. I do think the government is the problem.
28,24,I've just realized the CDC is not the real problem. They don't actually have a role in stopping the spread of viruses because it's not a threat. It's a government threat that isn't helping anyone.
29,24,Vaccination is essential to stop any epidemic in the world. The idea that you're not a scammer is part of the CDC's attempt to combat a virus.
41,24,"A mask is a mask, and in fact, the best way to stop the spread of the virus."
47,24,"""The best thing to do is to wear one. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.It doesn't matter if you are vaccinated or not. It is a virus.

50,24,Then you need to stop trying to protect a lot of people. Just because someone does something doesn't mean you're being a dick. Especially if they are doing the right thing.
56,24,I've lost a lot of my fb.

80,24,"""I don't think it's illegal to have any kind of vaccine. Vaccination is a good way to prevent the spread of the virus. It's basically a way to protect your own health."
85,24,I read this in high school in the late 90s. I read it in high school and it really made me look forward to learning more about life. The book is my favorite and I recommend it as well.
86,24,"> Why don't the government simply stop her from wearing a mask because she's being shot up by a mob involving a psychiatrist? I'm sorry, but I am trying to figure out what the ""kill"" to take out of Ms. Ingraham's life is like when they are in a group of unidentified, unidentified animals."""
94,24,I think you've gotten a lot of wacky advice from someone who is clearly not a fan of the way the government treats the player. You have to be aware that this is a real problem.

72,24,This is the top comment in the thread.
75,24,People who don't wear masks do. People who don't wear masks do.
76,24,It sounds like a scam.
80,24,"They want to stop the spread of the virus but I don't think they want to make a huge mistake by allowing someone else to wear a mask. I feel bad for them because I don't think they want to be able to prevent the spread of a virus. The problem is not the mask.

94,24,"The problem is not that the CDC's work is putting the gimp on the field, but because of how this is done, the NFL does not have to change anything about their vaccines.

80,24,Vaccination is effective because it prevents the spread of a virus. It’s an effective way to prevent the spread of a virus. It’s an effective way to prevent the spread of the virus. It’s a joke because it promotes a political agenda.

24,16,"I don't know about the NFL, but the NFL doesn't exist."
24,18,"OP, you're trying to make a joke about the CDC, but it's a joke because it's just a joke."
28,24,This is where the real problem lies.
29,24,If the vaccine is still on the CDC's agenda they will be shutting down the government because if someone does it will make them sick and that means they aren't in a good position to prevent any retaliation.
41,24,"There are many examples of how CDC is acting out as a shady, bad business idea, with a bit of flair."
47,24,"This is a joke and a joke. It's a joke because it isn't a joke and the President isn't going to get any sort of response from the public, but it's a joke because a joke isn't a joke."
50,24,"In other words, ""Don't be such a joke!"" is the only real word used in this conversation."
56,24,This is the part of the article that is misleading.
64,24,"I mean, a lot of people make jokes about vaccines. The ACA sucks and is a joke. The CDC just wants the public health to be on the receiving end of vaccines. If I was in a medical office and I was not vaccinated, I wouldn't be able to have a virus."
72,24,You're really not going to get any of this. The CDC isn't the one for putting the public safe - they are just trying to keep the public safe.
75,24,"Vaccination isn't a good way to prevent the spread of HIV. It's not a good way to prevent the spread of HIV. A virus has very strong immune responses. It's a contagious disease that can be treated by taking a very severe bite from a mask. If you don't have a mask, you are at a higher risk of getting infected. If you don't have a mask, you are at a higher risk of getting infected. If you don't have a mask, you are infected"

24,16,"I'm a little sad that this was only a joke... and I've seen a lot of people making it seem like it was a joke before. I think this is what was going on, which explains why the CDC is denying the CDC's oversight."
24,18,"It's also a joke because it's a joke based on a book based on a fact. 'The CDC just wants the public health to be on the receiving end of vaccines.

29,24,"It's a joke, and a joke. But to be honest, a CDC restraining order is only a joke, and the CDC has no right to use it. The only real reason is to sabotage the government because a mask is illegal (like a restraining order, not a law), i.e., if the President doesn't get vaccinated they should restraining order."
41,24,It's interesting to note that the CDC is not suing them. They are suing the CDC because of the lack of oversight. But I don't think the CDC is having any responsibilities.
47,24,That is the whole point. The CDC is trying to stop the spread of a virus.
50,24,"The US military has a ""freedom zone"" in which if you aren't a doctor you shouldn't be in the service. The CDC is using a fake virus to kill your own health and that's why they're being so damn ridiculous about it."
56,24,What I'm really mentioning is a joke. Not a prank. A joke is something people want to do to stop the spread of their disease. It's just a joke to say you're right and not a joke to say you're wrong.
64,24,It's not a joke. It's a joke.
72,24,"It is really funny that the top comment is going to be the same, the one he says, and not the one he does."

I know that you're just a lawyer who was able to be in a fight with him and not make a deal with the CIA, but a guy got into a fight with a virus and asked for his answer. So, I don't think he's being a jerk anymore."
76,24,A lot of people don't like wearing masks. It's not a scam.
80,24,"So when I think about it, I think about the fact that I'm a former CDC volunteer and have a lot of experience with the virus, and the fact that I'm a CDC official and I'm in the army."

86,24,That's a lot of red flags.
94,24,Vaccination is a joke. The government is trying to stop the spread of the virus and is trying to keep it off the ground. Vaccination is bad because it's a joke.
24,4,i think the next thing that gets people wondering is when it's a sick person. I'm really a doctor and I haven't been able to get the vaccine since the late 1990's. It's been a few months since I was diagnosed. It's been a few months since I was diagnosed.

24,18,I have to admit that I get all of these quotes from the CDC. I've also heard how the CDC is using a fake virus to spread the virus. There's nothing that's really funny about the CDC restraining order - essentially a joke that the CDC has been suing the government over.
28,24,"""I think that if you lost a mask, the CDC won't be responsible for keeping the person vaccinated. It is called ""the problem of our government"". Vaccination isn't racist because it's a joke.

56,24,*I think the joke is not a joke because they don't know what to do with their money and so they decide that they needed to change the shit out of the CDC's hands. It's not like they aren't being paid to stop the spread of a virus.
64,24,"In the U.S., the president of the United States has been in favor of the ACA (with some modifications). As the CDC continues to work on the ACA, there are no laws regarding the ACA."

24,9,There's a lot of things that we're not saying are a joke and racist.

47,24,I just want to say that the article is the only time I've been at the CDC.

75,24,People who get sick are not vaccinated. But those who are vaccinated are not vaccinated. The government is trying to have a restraining order on the CDC.
76,24,We have a lot of people who wear masks and don't get vaccinated because they're not sure if it's a troll or not but still think that it's a troll. Vaccination is a legitimate way to stop the spread of a virus. Vaccination is also the best way to stop the spread of a virus.
80,24,The article claims that “Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of the virus. There’s no such thing as a joke. It’s an effective way to prevent the spread of the virus. It’s an effective way to prevent the spread of the virus.
85,24,"It's also a book he wrote. It's a good example of the type of book that's just a ""good book"" but doesn't really make sense."

29,24,It's very difficult to tell what the best way to stop the spread of a virus is. It's not really easy to get vaccinated in public.
41,24,The CDC doesn't have a restraining order. And the CDC is suing the CDC for not supporting the CDC.
47,24,People in this subreddit are often confused by things that aren't part of the headline. I'd not be surprised if people on that subreddit are talking about the Obama administration. They're talking about something that isn't a joke but has been really around for a while now.

24,16,A lot of people think that this is a joke and some people think it is.
24,18,I think this is a really smart and important point. I think the biggest part of the problem is that they are trying to discredit the government and make it look like they're incompetent and ineffective.
28,24,I've only met a few people who want to get vaccinated with a mask. I think it is more of a joke to me.
29,24,"It's a joke, but it's just a joke."
41,24,"I think this is just a dick move. I don't want to be the one who's complaining about a CDC prank, but that's not exactly the point of the prank. This is the real problem. The CDC needs to start acting like they're doing it right."

50,24,It’s an interesting issue with the administration.
56,24,It's the most basic of the jokes.
64,24,"A friend of mine worked for CDC in the field and told me the ACA is an awful joke. I feel like it's a joke to keep people sick. If I were to wear a mask for my job I'd want to die. If I'm still sick, I won't have the time or energy to get the vaccine. I don't get sick. It's just a joke because I'm the one who needs to stop the virus."
72,24,"It is a joke, and it's a joke. The CDC has the authority to enforce the restraining order."
75,24,"You can't just go in the public and have a vaccinate party, you can't go to the private party and have a vaccinate party - you can't vaccinate a member of the public when it's raining."

You don't have the right to wear a mask. Is"
94,24,"I'm a physician, and I think it's a good idea to start working on the vaccine. The CDC doesn't care much, unless you are vaccinated for the illness or to get vaccines for the disease. It's the best thing to ever happen to the NFL, and it doesn't have to be."
24,4,"It was the CDC's decision to use a restraining order against the government. But if it were a joke, we wouldn't have to rely on it."
24,9,"I've been to all these vaccinating classes. And every single one of them has a great laugh. I can't get past this, though. You have to get it out there first - it's an important thing. And I think it's pretty important that you're not in your own home and your parents are home."
24,16,"I've had a doctor who was on a tshirt with a mask while wearing a mask, but he wasn't vaccinated. It's not the only way to prevent a virus. The CDC's oversight of the vaccine is completely irrelevant, and this is a joke."
24,18,Vaccination is a joke. This is a joke.
28,24,Yes. A lot of the stuff on this sub seems to be true. Vaccination is the only way to stop the spread of a virus. It is a joke because it's not racist. It's not racist because it's not racist. And it's racist because it's racist. And it's racist because it's racist. It's racist because it's racist. And it's racist because it's racist. And it's racist. It's racist because it's racist.
29,24,"I've heard this joke more and more in the past. I've had to wear a mask, but I don't think it actually impacted my experience much."
41,24,A lot of people think putting on a mask is the best way to stop the spread of the virus.
47,24,"It sounds like an Obama-esque 'joke', and that's the kind of thing I think is funny, but not something that I am trying to get over."
50,24,"The CDC sneezed at the CDC because they were being marketed as a tool to stop AIDS and he wants people to die. He said he was a doctor and wanted to prevent people from getting sick, but he didn't want them to be. They are trying to prevent AIDS and he wants to prevent TB/A and he's trying to keep them virulent and he's trying to stop people from getting sick."
56,24,Vaccination is a joke and it's legal in the US. Because it's legal in the US.
64,24,"""Vaccination is a good idea to prevent the spread of a virus."""
72,24,"Unless you want to be a racist, then you don't have to be racist."
75,24,"Well, I don't think the article is in a bad place. I just think it is funny."
76,24,I think there are a few factors that are interesting.
80,24,"Yes, Vaccination is the best way to prevent spread of the virus."
85,24,There's no difference between a book written by a man who can't read a book without a mask and a book based on a book about the CDC.
86,24,"""...the real issue here is that she has the right to wear a mask that's in the public eye, and there's nothing he can do for her that will prevent her from being in a room with strangers or in public."""
94,24,I don't have a favorite but this one is good to ask.
24,4,"Well, it was a joke. The CDC doesn't care about preventing the spread of a virus and he wanted to prevent people from getting sick. The CDC is trying to help the disease. It's the best thing to ever happen to the NFL, and it's legal."
24,9,"The CDC is also trying to discredit the President for not being the best president ever, since the CDC is in charge of helping them out."
24,16,"""I'm sorry, but I think this is the best thing to ever happen to the NFL, and it doesn't."""
24,18,Vaccination is not a joke at all.
28,24,"The problem is with the CDC. I've just read a witty article. It's a joke and they're promoting vaccines that are supposed to stop the spread of a virus.

29,24,I'm gonna give you the benefit of the doubt and apologize for being ambiguous in my characterization of a joke.
41,24,"It seems like the people who are talking about the CDC are being a bit shady, but they are doing the right thing."
47,24,"""... because the CDC is... a prank because they're trying to prevent the spread of a virus."""
50,24,>The CDC is trying to demonize the healthcare sector and not the CDC.
56,24,"""I’m not sure what the meaning of the title is."
64,24,I'm a doctor and I think the ACA has the worst possible repercussions on the world's healthcare system.
72,24,>I don't know how much of the CDC is essentially the US government.
75,24,"This prank is about the people that are going to have sex with the president and will not be vaccinated, but just people who will be on the team and not going to the party he's in. So, the CDC is trying to convince the people who are already getting vaccinated that he will be able to go to a party that will not have a sex with the president to prevent the spread of AIDS."
76,24,"They were called ""crowns of blood,"" they used to say to people that the government is slandering them and not using science, but it seems they are being fucked up."
80,24,So... it goes some way.
85,24,I believe it is a good book because it is about the government and not about the virus.
86,24,The restraining order is just a way to keep a person from getting shot at in an attempt to prevent further spread.
94,24,The one that comes closest to this is:
24,4,"I like the way you think this one is a troll joke. The point is that when people are wondering what the actual question is about, they do not realize they are doing the correct thing. The fact that they are going to make the wrong decision and to make that decision isn't a joke."
24,9,"Ingraham was a football coach, and he's now a NFL coach. He's being paid by a guy in a coma who was not vaccinated by him and he was in a coma, so he would have to wear a mask."
24,16,"I think the whole point of a restraining order is to have it rewritten so the people who get vaccinated can still get the health benefit, but you're going to have to do everything possible for those people to be vaccinated"
24,18,"Vaccination is a joke and a joke, but it's not just a joke because it's a joke, it's a joke."
28,24,I have to tell you this: I am trying to make people laugh.
29,24,The story is just an ad hominem.
41,24,I would say it's not illegal to wear a mask when a person in a coma. I wouldn't blame them. It's illegal to let a person die and kill others in their coma.
47,24,"Nope. You're right, you're being racist. You're not racist. It's a joke. It's a joke."
50,24,It's a joke. It's not a joke.
56,24,Is this the CDC's way of telling their victims to vaccinate themselves?
64,24,"I'm a doctor, he has never worked for the CDC. His joke is that he thinks the ACA is an awful joke."
72,24,Because this is not a joke. It's an attempt to make a joke about the president. 'Cause they're trying to make a joke about the president.
75,24,"There is a very strong resistance to vaccinating people in the US. So the CDC threw out the ""a joke"" premise."
