74,66,It’s a pretty bad joke.
74,72,It would seem that in the USA if you don't want to wear a mask you have to keep one. In my country a mask doesn't actually actually prevent anything. You have to go to a doctor and tell them to be aware of what they are doing.

74,40,"Well, I'll leave that out because I can't even believe that the government is trying to prevent the spread of HIV."

74,50,The CDC is not responsible for the spread of the virus. There is a lot of unregulated surveillance on people.
