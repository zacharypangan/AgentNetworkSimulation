52,15,"That's actually pretty bad. You don't really know the laws of the world, but the government is using the mask as a way of hiding it. They could potentially do alot to stop someone from wearing it, and then get a bang out of it. It's not a good idea."

35,15,It's not just a scam. A scam. It's a conspiracy.

15,5,I'm so sorry. But we need to see where we go.
15,6,"My dad had a mask on when he got the flu when he was 20. I'd had it on him for almost a year and it worked for me. My brother has had his infected lungs shaved out for a year and they're getting rid of a ton of them every year, allowing him to do something about it."

72,15,Are you sure that your insurance company will pay for a vaccination and not go to your local health department?
84,15,"I’ve lost one of my old masks. He doesn’t wear it anymore. It’s only one he wears. I mean, no one actually wears a mask in his life. It’s a scam, but not a scam."

52,15,"There's an AMA about this right here where it says that this is actually a joke from someone who was vaccinated for HIV/VHC. It's a joke, but it's a joke."
55,15,The White House is trying to get rid of the president's mask.
62,15,I've lost my mask. It doesn't make me sick and that's just me.
72,15,"In an effort to avoid a repercussion of an incredibly expensive vaccine, the CDC has also tried to get the government to do so. But the truth is that the CDC is the main factor."
84,15,"I agree with you on this point. Vaccination is not really a bad thing, it's just the worst thing we can do. If the vaccinated person is still in school, there is no such thing as an illness despite not getting vaccinated and they're making mistakes."
85,15,"He's basically a writer, not a movie star."
100,15,"I'm very confused, but are you sure that the first part of the article is a little misleading?"
15,5,This is a great premise for the movie.
15,6,It's a joke. I'm not even sure it was intended as a joke - I don't think I'm being racist at all.
15,10,"As someone who had to do all that, I think this is quite a simple joke. I don't think the CDC really has a problem with it. I think it was more of a prank than a joke. Rather than addressing the situation of the vaccines, I think it was a joke."
15,12,The point here is that these people are not vaccinated. They are getting vaccines because they are sick. It's not a joke.
17,15,">Is it an election? I'm not sure. The government is being a troll, a troll, and a troll is what the government does and does not."
29,15,">The problem with a mask is that people are sick and have an infection of some kind, not what's actually being used to fight off the virus.

40,15,"...as an nfl fan, I just thought it was a joke."
52,15,"I don't think I'm a fraud, but that's because there's a lot of sexist jokes in this sub."
55,15,"The issue is not that the president was trying to use it to stop a virus, it's that he is trying to change this."
62,15,So he has to get a mask and then use it on other people's pets?
72,15,"You are a troll, obama."
84,15,"a lot of people get vaccinated for HIV/VHC. Not only is it an awful disease, it's one of the most important things that we can do to prevent it."
85,15,This is what a lot of people find funny:

I think the government has a problem.” “We have a problem with a problem with the truth.”"
15,12,he is a troll for wanting to make a joke that is the equivalent of a joke to being racist.
17,15,I think the issue is that I'm not a lawyer.
29,15,>A friend of mine fucked up and didn't get a syphilis vaccine. That was actually a pretty serious case of this.
34,15,So there's no point in putting on a mask and then doing a piece of legal advice in the hope that your government will eventually shut them down?
35,15,"Yes, it is a scam. They are actually in the business of promoting the vaccine. "
40,15,It's hard to explain something in this thread. I'm on mobile so I can't find anything online.
52,15,"Vaccination is the only cure to a virus. If they aren't vaccinated, they will be infected and the doctors will think a prank is going on, not the government. That's a joke."
55,15,It's a scam. Vaccination is a scam. The White House is trying to get rid of it.
62,15,CANNOTANSWER is a moron. He has no business knowing what a mask looks like.
72,15,There is a reason you have so little understanding of health and what your government does. But if your government is really trying to prevent it from being more effective then it is going to have some effect in the future.
84,15,"I don't think I've seen a story in some years about the government trying to try and stop the spread of AIDS, that is."

100,15,"""I'm not a racist. He is a repressive president who is a dick."""

15,6,"""... I think you're not being racist at all."""
15,10,The joke is that the president fucked up and didn't have syphilis. And he doesn't get to show the dick. I think he's an idiot for believing this and saying that the only vaccine is to fight AIDS.
15,12,So the president is a shit person and the government is trying to shut them down?
17,15,">You can't vaccinate a man without having a mask."", ""No, it's a joke, it's not."", ""Pretty funny."""

35,15,The article itself is extremely vague.
40,15,"I feel like you are right in your own mind that the CDC is not an anti-vaccination force. In fact they are suing people who do not wear a mask to stop a virus from spread. That is a prank, you're a fucking dick."
52,15,"If it is a prank, then the joke doesn't work."
55,15,"People don't seem to understand the problem. The problem is the mask, a mask to prevent the spread of the virus, and a mask to keep people from getting sick. That's why the NSA is not allowed to prevent sex. The CIA's only solution is to prevent people from getting sick. That's why the NSA is not allowed to prevent sex. The CIA's only solution is to prevent people from getting sick, because of a lack of the mask, and not because of a lack of a safe environment to live in."
62,15,"It's just a joke, and it is the very basis of any moral jurisprudence that will go through the courts."
72,15,The CIA is trying to force the government to enforce health laws. They need to stop using the word troll.
84,15,I read that it was a real deal and I was not going to be honest. I've heard some similar stories in the media.
85,15,"So you're going to give a quote to me: ""It's interesting because you don't know what he's talking about. It’s probably not about what he does. I know that a lot of sarcasm is implied because it is the first book I read. I know that a lot of people would have to be referring to the same situation as the guy on the front page. (I'm not surprised, though)"""
100,15,"if he's a racist, then this is a ripoff of Obama."
15,5,The government is trying to force you to make a'shameful joke'. It's not the joke itself. It's the joke. It's a joke. 'The president is a ripoff of Obama. '
15,6,I don't know if this is a real quote but it doesn't really make sense.
15,10,"The first line is really funny, and is not funny enough to be funny."
15,12,I'm not sure if he's trying to be racist or if he's just a troll or if he's trying to get his head out of his ass and to make a joke that's a joke or just a joke.
17,15,It's not a joke. It's a joke because a person can wear a mask without thinking about it.
29,15,">We'll have to get a sexy, mask a mask, and then getting vaccinated. If you can afford it, the better the chance of the virus spreads to you and your team."
34,15,The most important thing is to be aware of what is going on and be aware of the consequences of it.
35,15,Vaccines are used to stop the spread of the virus. It's been proven that the vaccine is not a vaccine. That's why it is legal in the US and not just in the US.
40,15,> Why are you saying that Vaccination isn't a joke.
52,15,This is a good example of why the government is working so hard to prevent the spread of the virus.

62,15,A real life example of a fake mask:
72,15,>The article does state that wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.They're trying to put people down with this sort of thing and put you at risk for it. The whole thing is a'snoop' with the US government and it is a BS/Bulletin.
84,15,Basically the government is trying to do something in a way to stop the spread of HIV. It can get pretty shady.
85,15,I'm not surprised he is a jerk.
100,15,"I think the most interesting part is that you know all about Trump, and the Obama administration. What makes you think he's a racist is that he's making this a joke."
15,5,"A mask can keep people from being infected and doctors are going to think they're not at risk. This is a joke. A joke because a mask doesn't hurt people. A joke because it makes people feel like a fool, because they're just not going to believe it. A joke because it's a joke because a doctor's wife can not say anything that is a joke. A joke because you're a ripoff of Obama."
15,6,I lied about the mask.
15,10,"Aside from the one line I'm referring to, you're not right."
15,12,What is the point of a troll being a ripoff of Obama?
17,15,"Vaccination is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.You don't know that they have to deal with this as a public liability company, but they are still putting in places to protect their employees.

29,15,This isn't a joke...
34,15,Vaccination is a vaccine.
35,15,"A lot of these are just plain old nonsense. The story is over. If you think this is a good way to do it, you'll have to go see a lawyer. But that's not fair."

52,15,"I think that there are a lot of people who are worried that some of these people are going to be a victim of a virus, but that's not the case. The US Department of Agriculture would snoop in and remove the smear system."
55,15,Vaccination is not a policy of the government.
62,15,"I'm not sure I agree with you, but you are a troll. It's not a joke. And that's the troll."
72,15,"I don't know what that means in my country, but as an American I can say that wearing a mask does not protect the health of an individual or group. And I have been vaccinated a few times, and I feel that wearing a mask is not a joke."

17,15,> Vaccination is the best way to stop the spread of a virus.
29,15,It's so weird. How could anyone wear a mask and get syphilis?
34,15,Vaccination is not a joke.
35,15,It's the sort of thing the government does to prevent the spread of the virus.
40,15,So the CDC is trying to make healthcare available to people in the US. They're a troll company. They have no obligation to enforce health care laws. They have no moral obligation to enforce them. Vaccination is a joke.
52,15,I don't know what the smear system is.
55,15,Vaccination is NOT a policy of the government.
62,15,"I've heard this on the radio before, it sounds like it's going to get worse."
72,15,That is exactly what they are trying to do. They are trying to make the government look bad and make it look like they aren't doing anything about it. The CDC isn't doing anything about it.
84,15,"I'm an american, and this post is about something a lot of people do not understand. It's very misleading. The CDC and NSA are suing this post for fraud."

15,12,I think a little more racial hate will take over our country when it comes to the government. I'm not really familiar with the politics of the US government at all.
17,15,"I'm not sure I understand the ""trolls"" part as well."
29,15,I would wear a mask and wear a mask and then get vaccinated. I think it is ridiculous. I think it is because people are not being in control of their actions. Vaccination is essential. It is vital that people are getting vaccinated. It is also part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
34,15,They need to start a fight if you don't put on a mask. And this should be a joke. They need to get away with the shit they are doing and stop trying to do them.

34,15,The CDC needs to stop using a troll and sell tools to stop the spread of the virus. That's the problem.
35,15,It's a joke. It's a joke because the government isn't on the receiving end of the problem.
40,15,The ACA is the worst thing on the planet.
52,15,The CDC is suing the CDC for having to cover this as well.
55,15,"A few of them are in the US, but in general, the people you are talking about are people."
62,15,"It’s a joke. They don’t have to make it illegal, it’s legal in the U.S."
72,15,You're not a joke. You're just an idiot.
84,15,I don't think the CDC and NSA are suing this for fraud. Is there anything that could be done to prevent a virus from spreading to other people?
85,15,"You might have already read the book ""Weeds to Break a Tree,"" that's a great way to start a conversation about the government's strategy of stopping a virus. It's a great book and a great movie. But I don't think it's worth watching at all."
100,15,Is this the kind of thing that makes people think they are racist?

17,15,Vaccination is the best way to stop the spread of a virus.
29,15,This was about a guy who was getting a syphilis vaccine. I think it is funny.
34,15,It's like a joke about a guy in a suit putting on a mask. A guy in a suit with a mask.
35,15,"Are you a lawyer? You can wear a mask for vaccination, but you can't vaccinate yourself, and if you're not a lawyer, you don't vaccinate yourself."
40,15,Vaccination is not a joke - it is a joke - but a joke.
52,15,This is a good example of why the government is working so hard to prevent the spread of the virus.
55,15,"Well, it's the president's job to keep a person from getting sick, and that's why the CDC is trying to cut funding to keep them from getting sick."
62,15,Isn’t it illegal for the government to use a mask as a way to stop the spread of HIV?
72,15,The whole thing is a'snoop' with the US government and it is a BS/Bulletin.

55,15,The president is not going to stand against the CDC's actions. He is going to stand on the side of the country and get the full story of the CDC's actions.
62,15,I think a few things are happening here:
72,15,"A lot of people have a mentality about vaccination and it sucks because it's not very common. I get what you're saying, but I don't think that's going to change anything. It's just a scam."
84,15,"""I don't understand why someone would say they'd wear a mask every day, so they have to have a good hat on."""

He needs to be able to keep a hat on and get the hat off. You could try him. He needs to figure out that he's going to do it as well as he can. I don't think he's going to get a hat on when he is going to do it.

15,12,This is a lot like how the person who posted here got ripped off by the CDC because of the anti-vaccination rant and he was stung by a cigarette lighter. He said that he wanted to make a joke about a terrorist and was scared to go to a party and snoop at people that were sick if they weren't vaccinated unless he actually had a problem putting a mask on the top of their head. He was being stung at least a bunch of the CDC rip off
17,15,That's a little BS but the joke is very real.
29,15,"This is the first time I've heard this one. They seem to be trying to nitpick on me. I'm just not that familiar with it. I didn't even realize it, I just wanted to say the most important part is stating that the guy he is talking to isn't actually a doctor, and that the person he is talking to isn't going to get vaccinated."
34,15,Vaccination is a joke. The CDC needs to stop using a troll and sell tools to stop the spread of the virus. That's the problem. It's a joke.
35,15,They should be addressing all those ad hominem comments in the article.
40,15,>The President's message is racist.
52,15,"It's called a prank, a joke. It doesn't have the exact same meaning as a joke."
55,15,I believe it's the president's idea of getting vaccinated that is shady. They're trying to wring up the money and make it difficult for the CDC to cut funding.
62,15,I'm really confused by your question. You say you believe that the government is trying to stop the spread of HIV and you think it's ridiculous?
72,15,It sounds like the CDC is just snooping into his shit and not taking the lead.
84,15,I would consider it a fake.
85,15,"It was written by Bill Nye, and he wrote his book on the subject."
100,15,"I don't think we're in a discussion about the topic in the first place. I think a lot of this is from someone who didn't know him, because it's basically just me. I don't know anything about the history of this issue so I don't know what I'm talking about."
15,5,The guy he's talking to is a fucking moron.
15,6,There's an article about that in the first issue on the National Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that tries to bring up this question as one of the most egregious anti-vaccination issues that have ever been uncovered.
15,10,The CDC is trying to push a false assumption based on the first line.
15,12,"[NAME] is a real president, and his name was Bill Nye."

35,15,Vaccines are not effective in stopping the spread of the virus. This is just the nature of the government.
40,15,I know that you're not gonna get back to me. But that's the point. You're going to get relegated to r/politics. I don't think that the government is the best tool for preventing it from spreading a virus. You're not going to get relegated to r/politics. You're going to get relegated to r/politics.

72,15,"I like the guy a little more, but I also do like how he uses'snooping' a lot. If you're really interested in the CDC, snooping is an interesting, relevant and important part of the presidential campaign and would like to know more about how a CDC member is being used to do this shit."
84,15,"This is like a little joke: ""Some people don't know how to do a job."

15,5,"""If I were a doctor, I wouldn't wear a mask on people with an illness or a medical condition (with a virus) so I wouldn't need to be a doctor."""
15,6,I can see why people are going to get relegated to r/politics because the CDC is not doing enough work to keep people from getting sick. The CDC is trying to push the false assumption and it is one of the most egregious anti-vaccination issues that have ever been uncovered.
15,10,I am not saying the joke is an ad hominem. I am saying that it is a joke.

34,15,"I'm not sure the joke that prompted this was racist, but some people think this is a joke?"
35,15,"Vaccines are a joke. They do not use them, but they are very effective in stopping it. The CDC does not have a role in stopping the spread of the virus, so the government should not take any actions to stop it."
40,15,Vaccination isn't a joke. It's about a virus that isn't a government mandate. The ACA isn't a big deal. It's about a virus that isn't a government mandate. They're not suing people who don't wear a mask.
52,15,"I think that's a joke for a joke, and a joke for a joke."

85,15,"I just have to say this: ""(a lot of people) think wearing a mask is a great idea."
100,15,I'm trying to work on this now.
15,5,It's very funny to read how he responds to the joke and how he is making it seem like he is just trying to get away from the real problem.
15,6,CDC doesn't have the power to stop the spread of the virus. It's an important part of the CDC's anti-vaccination program.
15,10,Vaccines are a joke and it’s not a joke. This is what the CDC should do. It’s not the government.
15,12,"Honestly, you're not doing the right thing."

35,15,"I am a lawyer and am not a lawyer. I have never read a book by this author, but that is a lie."
40,15,The article is not a joke. It's about a virus that isn't a government mandate. It's about a virus that isn't a government mandate.
52,15,"Well, it's also part of the law that you can't change a mask if the rules are not changed since the first time. That's really not the point."
55,15,"""If it sounded like the CDC was doing all the work to protect against the spread of the virus, would they have vaccinated a man with a mask?"""
62,15,That's a good point.

15,10,"No, this isn't a joke. It's a joke. That's the point. It's a joke, not an actual joke."
15,12,I think the most racist thing he's ever done is to talk about it like a racist joke / cliche. He's basically saying the government is trying to shut them down.
17,15,"The word prank is used to mock the government because it pisses people off. This is a joke, but it is not a joke."

15,10,"Is there anything wrong with the prank? Because, I've been referring to the whole ""what if we were not vaccinated, because of the lack of syphilis?"", so I think you're making a point to keep saying the ad hominem is an actual joke."

This isn't about a joke if it's not a joke. I would say it's a ""joke"".

The article is in response to a joke in which the CDC isn't a joke, but the government"
40,15,"""I feel like you are right in your own mind that the CDC is not an anti-vaccination force. They have no obligation to enforce health care laws. They have no moral obligation to enforce them. Vaccination is a joke."""
52,15,It's a joke. It's a joke. A joke. A joke is a joke.
55,15,The CDC is working to sway the health care reform movement. That is why they’re not going to go back to the CDC.

52,15,Vaccination is a joke. Isn't it a joke?
55,15,"I see the point of these sentences. The CDC is not going to let the President continue to go to any lengths to protect people, besides protecting his own health and the health of his family, for example, if they would stop doing the things they are doing that would make people sick.

15,5,So you think you know what a joke is? Because you just read a funny story and then you go back to the facts. And they're just a joke.
15,6,I've found this to be pretty insensitive and ambiguous in terms of what you're talking about. I don't have any idea who the main topic of the joke is but I could say that there is a joke there.
15,10,So here's a possible answer: The president is a ripoff.
15,12,"I like the idea of the ""sick people getting vaccinated."""
17,15,"I am not sure what that means. What's the difference between ""I want to stop being a prankster and an actual prankster"" and ""The government is trying to destabilize the CDC?""?"

40,15,Because you're so ignorant of everything that's being discussed in a lot of this thread.
52,15,This is a joke. It is a joke because it doesn't have the exact same meaning as a joke.
55,15,I think this is a very good point. The president has a lot of sarcasm and a few naive comments about the administration.
62,15,[NAME] says that the CDC is trying to sue him because of a joke about people wearing masks.
72,15,I don't think people really think that a joke is a joke. I think it's a'snoop' because a little bit of snooping would make it sound like the whole story is a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke and isn't a joke. Vaccinations is a joke because it's a joke because it's supposed to keep the public safe. It's a joke because it's supposed to keep the public safe.

A restraining order isn't a restraining order. A restraining order isn't a restraining order. A restraining order isn't a restraining order.
15,12,Why do people have such a high standard for understanding the issue?
17,15,I don't think the CDC needs a lawyer for this. It's a lot of people getting sick when they don't get vaccinated.
29,15,He's a troll? It's a joke.
34,15,"Heh. My good friend. If you don't know how to get it, please get a new doctor."

72,15,"The CDC is trying to get the CDC to take care of it, putting people at risk."

34,15,"The CDC has nothing to do with it. They are going to try to protect people with HIV/AIDS in ways that would be racist, and they won't stop. If you want to 'keep it' then you've got to start the fight. It isn't that funny."
35,15,"Vaccines are the law and they are not the jokes that CDC and CDC are promoting, but the joke is because of the government and not a ""scam"" joke."

84,15,"A lot of people don't have AIDS yet, and it is a scam. I mean, there are other ways to make sure people have it and how to avoid the problem. Vaccination is a part of the health system, but it isn't a conspiracy theory."
85,15,I really don't know what to say.
100,15,> Is your grandmother a minor in the White House?
15,5,You're trying to make a joke. No one wants to put a mask on the people who aren't vaccinated.
15,6,Vaccination is an important part of the health system.
15,10,"You got a lot going on. The entire point of the book is, ""I think a prank is an actual joke."
15,12,"I think the point of the book was to give context for what I'm being said. I'm not sure if he's trying to be racist, but I can say that it's a joke."
17,15,I have a doctor who is trying to help people. I have a family who is in a hospital in Florida. We have a friend who is in a hospital in Arizona with AIDS.
29,15,"It's the kind of sexist nonsense that the government can't do without a bit of a snarky stance. It is an important premise that should be the top argument, but it's not the best."
34,15,[The CDC is being slighted](http://www.dcdc.gov/cdc_restrictions/docs/slmfg_docs_dp/rr/cdcs/index.php)
35,15,In the article it says the government is trying to prevent the spread of a virus.
40,15,I'm going to say that this isn't a joke. It's not about the government. They have no obligation to enforce health care laws. They have no moral obligation to enforce them. Vaccination is a joke. It's not about the government.
52,15,Vaccination isn't a joke because it's a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke.
55,15,The president has a lot of sarcasm and a few naive comments about the administration.
62,15,"There are dozens of references to the problem of the government not knowing what a mask looks like, a few people are a bit suspicious, and a couple of other people who think the government is trying to stop HIV because of it."
72,15,The president does not want any sort of repercussion for the spread of Zika.

29,15,I am going to say that this is one of the stupidest comments on this subreddit i've ever read.
34,15,Is it possible that he was raped by a guy with a mask in the film?
35,15,You can go to the doctor.
40,15,Vaccination is not a joke. The CDC has no obligation to enforce health care laws. They have no moral obligation to enforce them. Vaccination is a joke.
52,15,Is it illegal to wear a mask because it is a joke or a joke?
55,15,The first line is an example of how the President's jokes are not really being discussed.
62,15,"Yes, i can't agree more with you than you. I just want to know why the government has been making people sick since 9/11. This is about sexism and the need to stop that in our country. I don't understand why the CDC is trying to sue the CDC for sexism because it is illegal in the U.S. and they are suing because of this."
72,15,"This is a joke. Vaccines aren't a joke. They aren't legal, and I doubt that's true. This is a joke about what's been talked about by conservatives, but the real issue here is that the CDC has tried to force the government to enforce health laws. They are trying to eat into their propaganda."
84,15,In the U.S. they're suing for fraud.

15,6,">""You know, i've heard that about the CDC."
15,10,I'm not sure where you're getting the answer in this context.
15,12,This is a huge topic of discussion in my opinion as well.
17,15,I think this is a very prankous joke. People are going to feel bad about it when they wear a mask.
29,15,It sounds like the CDC is trying to discredit the government over this.
34,15,I would be more of a joke if the president were to tell me that his snide stance and response were to a joke.
35,15,"The article states that ""you have a right to read the book, but not to read it"". It also claims that a CDC is promoting the vaccine."
40,15,"I'm a doctor, and I'm going to say this about Twitchcon and masks."

62,15,I've been reading through a whole lot of this stuff in the past a few weeks and I had no idea it was a joke. I just found out that a lot of people are getting pissed off when you say that he's trying to sue him for a fake mask.
72,15,> Vaccines are not a joke. They are not allowed under federal regulations.
84,15,It's a joke.
85,15,I'm sure the author is being extremely condescending.
100,15,"I've been reading this for a few weeks and was wondering if there was a big change in the way the president is portraying the president, even though it's a joke?"
15,5,"""I think the movie is pretty good. I think that he was trying to make a joke."""

17,15,> I don’t think it’s a joke. It’s a joke because it’s a joke.
29,15,Vaccination is the name of the vaccine. It is the name of the people that get the vaccine.
34,15,"The CDC is making jokes about his use of the word ""diaper "" when putting on a mask and letting people in on his off time have to be vaccinated, but not vaccinated because he's allergic to it."
35,15,I would say it's a joke that the government and the CDC are promoting the vaccine.
40,15,I'm not sure why people are so upset about this. I think that the point of this post is to make people understand that the CDC is suing people who don't wear a mask.
52,15,"The joke is sexist, but the joke is not a joke."
55,15,"What does the guy who says ""I don't know what to say but I want to know what I'm going to do, if it's okay"" mean?"
62,15,i think that the government is trying to sue the CDC for what they thought it was
72,15,“We need a group of people who understand what a mask is. 'We need a group of people who understand what a mask is.'”
84,15,The CDC and NSA are suing this post for fraud.

It's a joke because they are promoting it and the CDC doesn't even have the authority to do it. It's a joke because it is illegal. It's a joke because it is a joke because it's illegal. It's a joke because it's illegal.
40,15,Are you a doctor? Is it a joke?
52,15,I want to say that because the article states that it isn't a joke to eat a piece of tobacco because you're allergic to it and the only way it's a joke is to get the tobacco out of your pocket because of the fact that you have to put on a mask. It's not a joke that they are using the NSA to make the disease spread. The CDC would be investigating the CDC and trying to get people to get the CDC to get it.
55,15,It is a joke and a joke based on a lot of sarcasm and a few naive comments about the government.
62,15,People aren't supposed to do these things. The government is trying to sue the CDC for a joke and not wanting to do it.
72,15,"I'm not even going to give a full answer to your question, and I'm not sure you've heard this one."
84,15,Isn't a mask just a trick to stop the spread of the virus?
85,15,"Is there a good reason for you to avoid reading this? The author of the book will probably tell you if you read the book, but not necessarily the book."
100,15,A person's reaction to a joke is not the joke it is the joke.

15,12,I didn't know what that was.
17,15,"I've never heard anything about the CDC. It's a joke, and a joke. But I've heard this phrase about a doctor who told me in a private situation that the CDC didn't have the vaccines he had because there was an AIDS epidemic. It's not a joke. It's a joke. The president has the power to rig the public's healthcare system. They are not supporting it. They support it. They support it. They have no obligation to enforce it."
29,15,"It's not the ACA or any other health care law, it's the Obamacare mandate."
34,15,"The issue is that the CDC is trying to make it illegal because they know it's a joke. Vaccination is a joke because it's about preventing the spread of a virus. The issue is that the CDC is trying to hide the fact that the doctors are trolls and use the word ""diaper"" to sell tools to stop the spread of the virus. The problem is that the president is a liar. He's a big fan of everything that is going on in the CDC, and that's why he's"
35,15,It's a joke because a joke is a joke because it is not legal. I mean I don't understand the joke at all.

85,15,"I don't think the author, and his movie, are very interesting or interesting in comparison to the book. It isn't really that bad, and I don't think it is as good as a movie or a movie. I feel like the author is trying to get a restraining order."
100,15,"No. It doesn't matter. Rather than having them 'could' be the dick that is doing that thing. It's a joke. The joke's more about the mask and the context. The jokes are about removing the jokes. I know it's not about the mask, it's about how a racist joke is being made."
15,5,I was reading this book when I was a little kid. I had a really good time!
15,6,Vaccination is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. They are not going to make it illegal because they can't control what the people in the house wear in public. They can't control what the people in the house have. They are not going to do anything about it.
15,10,It's not a joke. It is a prank.

52,15,"I think the whole ""Distribution of Diseases"" thing is so ridiculous that the President tries to be as racist as possible. Vaccination isn't really a joke. It's just a joke. The government is trying to be more safe, and it's a joke because it's a joke because it doesn't have the exact same meaning as a joke. A prank is a joke because it's a joke, because it's a joke."
55,15,The only way to stop the spread of the virus is through the CDC.
62,15,You're not going to get any of those responses if you're not a lawyer.
72,15,"The CDC lied about what a troll is doing. Unless they don't know that it's not a joke, it wouldn't even be illegal for anyone to wear a mask for the same reason they're lied about it in the article."
84,15,It's not a joke. This is a real joke. You get that one. I'm not saying the government is trying to keep the spread of a virus. It's just a scam.
85,15,"I think this is just a sarcastic quote from Bill Nye. He's a writer, not a movie star. He wrote a book about the government. He wasn't the author of the book. His idea of a movie was a great one, but it's not really the best idea."

17,15,Vaccination is the best way to stop the spread of the virus. The CDC is trying to stop the spread of AIDS. They are trying to stop the CDC from trying to spread AIDS. They are trying to stop the CDC from trying to spread AIDS.
29,15,"And I'm not saying he needs to change the law or get a restraining order, just that it's not appropriate."
34,15,Is the CDC also selling tools? They're really not even interested in the problem at all and this one is only going to be a bit of a ploy.
35,15,So you were born in the United States? It was a joke in the form of a joke?
40,15,"It's not a joke, but it is a joke. The CDC is trying to make healthcare available to all people, and it isn't a joke."

85,15,"I don't know why they have to make a movie about it, but the movie itself is good. I don't know why the author is trying to get a restraining order against the CDC."

34,15,I had a similar situation with a man who was on a mask and the doctor said the doctor was a troll and made jokes. I didn't think the guy was a joke.
35,15,Then go to the CDC.
40,15,I just read an article in r/health which states that the CDC is suing people who don't wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus.
52,15,The joke is that the president is not a joke at all. Vaccination is only a joke because the CDC is trying to prevent the spread of the virus.
55,15,Vaccination is not a policy of the government.
62,15,The CDC is trying to sue him for a joke that isn't legal.
72,15,It's not a joke because the CDC is trying to make people sick and sick. It's a joke because it is supposed to keep people safe. It's a joke because it's supposed to keep the public safe. But it's supposed to keep people safe. It's a joke because it's supposed to keep people healthy.
84,15,That's not the way to put it. I just want to sneeze and say I've never lied.
85,15,You’re going to be right.
100,15,"So it's a joke to make a joke about a troll, or is it a joke to make a joke?"
15,5,"I'm not saying this is a joke, but I believe the idea that people need to get their brains tested by medical professionals is quite valid."
15,6,"If he were in the CDC's role as a supervisor, he'd still be in a position to get his head under control, in which case his supervisor would be under control and his supervisor would be over the CDC's job."
15,10,"So the CDC is trying to sabotage the government, and they are suing the president for a joke? Is that your personal opinion?"
15,12,"They are a bit of a joke. But if you're like me, you're really just being sarcastic. I don't know the meaning of these things, but it's just a joke and a joke if you're not willing to try it on the basis that it's racist."
17,15,"It's a joke about a man not wearing a mask. It's a joke about a government running their company. It's an advertisement about a troll who's a conspiracy theorist, who has a business plan based on his own interests."
29,15,It seems to be the only option for the CDC and the administration.

52,15,I know a good portion of this and what I've heard from people is based off of how funny the CDC is trying to force the vaccine on the president.
55,15,I think this is a good point. It's not a joke. It's not a policy of the government. It's a joke because the CDC is attempting to sway the health care reform movement.
62,15,"I figured out where they were going to do this. I was really surprised at their response but didn't know where they went with it. I don't know what they said and would just sit there and watch that. I'm a guy who does all of this as a job, and I just think it's a joke."
72,15,There is a lot of confusion here.
84,15,You are a troll and you are an idiot. What is your point?
85,15,And then they're talking about all the different approaches the government employs to scare people.
100,15,I read it and saw it first hand. So I knew what I was doing. I thought that's a joke. And I realized it was not a joke.
15,5,I think the best way to do this is to take him out on a tour of his office. I don't think he wants to go home.
15,6,I was going to post this. I'm not a doctor. I'm not an idiot. You can't be racist or anything.
15,10,I'm a doctor.
15,12,There is not a joke in the story and there are no laws that are racist. The story was written by a doctor who's work was to make it work.
17,15,I think that the CDC is trying to use ad hominem to destabilize the government.
29,15,">““”The problem with a mask is that people are sick and have an infection of some kind, not what's actually being used to fight off the virus."
34,15,The article is basically a bunch of jokes about the use of a mask
35,15,"As a lawyer, I have a lot of respect for the folks at [NAME] and [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME]"
40,15,The CDC is suing people who don't wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus. It's a joke because they want to stop the spread of a virus. They are trying to make healthcare available to people in the US. They have no obligation to enforce health care laws. They have no moral obligation to enforce them. Vaccination is a joke.
52,15,I would take this as a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke.
55,15,Vaccination is not a policy of the government.
62,15,So you're saying you aren't supposed to do this as a job?
72,15,It isn't a joke because he wants to get people to vaccinate him. It isn't a joke because the people who are trying to put people at risk aren't going to see what he wants. It isn't a joke because he wants to make the government do the job.
84,15,I read that the CDC is suing the government for a faked joke.
85,15,"It isn’t a great idea, but it is good."
100,15,"I think a joke is not a joke unless there is a quota. It's the joke itself that is a joke, and it is just a joke."
15,5,">I read this as a ""The Devil Wears a Mask"""
15,6,"It isn't a joke, it is a joke."
15,10,The book is based off a lot of different lines.
15,12,I'd go on and on and on until this movie hits the radio.
17,15,"[(('Mother"" '), (',"
29,15,"I have a big problem with this guy, but I get that we can't put it on, I guess we don't have to have a deal on it right now. I think that he should have asked for a restraining order."
34,15,>the entire point of the article is that you don't understand what it means to make a joke in an actual context. It's a joke because it's about what they know it is a joke.
35,15,[NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME]
40,15,"I don't understand what you're saying. They don't care about what the president says, they care about what the people who disagree with the president are doing. The President is trying to stop the spread of a virus. The CDC is trying to make healthcare available to people in the US. The CDC is trying to make healthcare available to everyone. They have no obligation to enforce health care laws. They have no moral obligation to enforce them. Vaccination is a joke. It's about the government."
52,15,"""I don't think the president should be able to resign and not coach until the safety of a helmet goes down."""
55,15,"I've been reading this and I don't know what it is to be a president, but I'm not certain what it is. Vaccination is a policy of the government."
62,15,"I don't have any advice to give. I don't have any suggestions to tell you what a joke is and how a joke is a joke is just a joke and is a joke, a joke is a joke and is a joke."
72,15,The CDC is going to become the best option for preventing a repercussion of the virus in the US and thus the CDC has a much more important role in keeping us safe.
84,15,I can't understand why the CDC is suing the government. They are trying to make money off the vaccine. It's really just a joke.
85,15,"""I just have to say this: I love the idea of people getting their heads in the right place and getting a book,"" ""I read the book and it was a great read."
100,15,What a ripoff! What a ripoff!
