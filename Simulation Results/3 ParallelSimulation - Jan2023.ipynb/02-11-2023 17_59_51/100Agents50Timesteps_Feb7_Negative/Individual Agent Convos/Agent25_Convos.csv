25,7,"They are being manipulated. It's a little like saying it's not cool to wear the NSA's mask on your face, but you're being manipulated."

Trump said it's ok not to wear mask, and Ingraham said it's restricting our rights to keep us locked inside!"
37,25,"I am not familiar with the details of this, but I was there on a date and it was quite different from when it was first issued, so it could not be anything different. I believe that this was done when the people that used the mask started using the ones that they have a contract with, like you are, bringing up. I know that's a pretty long story, but I do think it would be nice to talk to some of them about the new regulations."
47,25,The best thing to do is to wear one.
52,25,"I'm not sure what the definition of ""scam"" is, but maybe someone in the military is. They are getting pretty tired of seeing a fake mask, and people need to look into it."
59,25,i don't even like wearing a mask because it seems strange i just don't want to be on the field... I'm not a politician. i would be afraid of being kicked out of school for that.
66,25,The senate is doing exactly what the constitution says on this.

89,25,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
90,25,Ingraham doesn't seem to understand how the government's policies are designed to help people to avoid getting the disease.

25,7,He's not going to change his mind. There is no way in hell for people to change their mind.
30,25,Well the abolitionists here probably won't care how hard they try to force people to wear their masks or how bad the people who don't wear it are.
37,25,[Not sure if he wants to say that in another comment but I did see it as a joke here].
47,25,"This seems very logical and logical, not just a rhetorical one. It seems like people are not committing the stupidest thing on earth."
52,25,oh my gosh!
59,25,It's not a joke. They can't use a helmet. I don't think wearing a mask is the only way to stop a virus. They're used as the only means to prevent it from spread.

89,25,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
90,25,"Why do you think they are so resistant? That's why they aren't actually putting on a mask for the safety of others.

If you don't want to die, go to a GP or a physician. Then you need a PT. They will get sick and hurt you or your doctor and get it off. If you're scared"
101,25,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
25,1,I don't think you could get a whole lot of people vaccinated without going to the doctor. The doctors don't have to have all of their heads on the line. But the masks are the one that they use to prevent the spread of the virus.
25,2,The point of the quote is that Ingraham didn't want to talk about how government policies are designed to prevent the spread of a virus. They just want people to realize it. They just want people to realize it.
25,7,"That's pretty cool...I was thinking that I'd say that's not an option... I guess it's a question of whether or not the government is capable of removing a vaccine. I've done a lot of testing in a community with public health agencies, and the ones that are are trying to do it just have a mandate for me to wear one."
30,25,"It's a joke. It's like you want the other team to wear a mask, and your teammates and fans will try and do what they want to do with your face. They will probably not give you a reason to wear it, as they're going to be unable to do so."
37,25,People don't want to hear this. What's the matter with the government?
47,25,The mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.The best thing to do is to wear one.
52,25,"I think you should see a physician, or even a teacher about it. The best way to do it is to ask for advice and follow up with a doctor and the doctor."
59,25,"Vaccines will also be the way to go. It doesn't say you can't wear a mask, it says the players can wear one. It says you can't wear one for the purpose of preventing the spread of a virus."
66,25,I don't think it's a scam. It's a joke. I don't think it's a scam. The article is just a joke.
70,25,"I'm sure you're talking about the one where the government is using the word ""smoke"" as a slur."
72,25,"It is a scam. It isn't just an anti-viral bill slander. It is not illegal, but it's illegal in the US to keep a child on the street while the president is on the phone."
74,25,The best way to prevent the spread of the virus is to get everyone who does not know how to speak about it.
80,25,"The whole issue is that they use the masks as a substitute for helmets, not to stop a virus from spreading. If they are putting a mask on the player it will help him stop and start playing again."
84,25,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
89,25,I can imagine all the ghetto horror from the US 'Reddit' posts are pretty similar to what I was watching as a child and had a very similar reaction
90,25,Why does the FDA have to ban it in order to prevent a viral infection in public?
101,25,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
25,1,"It is a scam. It is not illegal. It is not illegal. It is not just an anti-viral bill slander. It is not illegal, but it's illegal to keep a child on the street while the president is on the phone."
25,2,"There is nothing illegal about the government having to use the word ""smoke"" to describe all the people who are vaccinated in public."
25,7,"It's not legal to keep people on the streets while the president is on the phone. But if the government is using the word ""smoke"" as a slur, how many people will get sick from this."
30,25,"... and then the person said he was doing it, and then he said it was a bad joke."
37,25,We have to start taking steps to stop this. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
47,25,It doesn't matter if you are vaccinated or not. It is a virus.
52,25,I've done some research to learn more about the mask.
59,25,"I'd be scared and thrown out of a high school, and go home."
66,25,"> He's the one who made it clear there was no danger. His point was not to be involved in the problem, but to get to the root of it, because I don't see it as a shady thing."
70,25,That's a joke.
72,25,You don't have to be a President to have a safe stance on the CDC's threat of HIV/AIDS. That would be a fucking problem.
74,25,He's still at least the one who was snarky. This is just his mom's idea of what a flu is. She has an asthma. It's not like she's a dick.
80,25,"In my experience, the CDC should be able to help you keep it from spreading. I can see the CDC using masks to fight the spread of a virus."

25,2,That's not what a fad would be. It is the fad and we are in this in a different direction. We just gotta be faggots and faggots and not faggots.
25,7,"I was gonna start doing a little r/legaladvice but he said he was snarky and not a politician. I'm not really sure about a good way to answer this question but if he was snarky then yes, it's a scam"
30,25,"OP's comment is also relevant to the part where Donald Trump was on a NSA prank on a kid and he said ""Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
37,25,"The government has the right to make changes, and not to go to any more meetings and events. They can't."
47,25,[NAME] has some logical and logical arguments based on his post ('I was trying to point out the stupidity of how well it's being deployed by the government and why there's not anything I can do about it.')
52,25,Yes. You're being a dick. I'm not a lawyer.
59,25,I'm confused - i don't know if i've done the same thing in my entire life - and i still don't have the right to be in the military
66,25,"In the same story, David Davis lost his helmet as a child, and he's actually trying to prevent it from getting out to the people."
70,25,There are a lot of jokes on reddit that can be used in context.
72,25,You don't have to be a member of the FDA to have a safe stance on the CDC's threat of HIV/AIDS. That would be a fucking problem.
74,25,>He's still at least the one who was snarky.
80,25,"I am not a doctor. It's my problem with the CDC, not the health care system."
84,25,This is a really sad picture of your mom.
89,25,"Yes it is and they will do what they want with it. You should go. It is an event that will probably end in death, but the people who will have to pay for the event have no other options. That is exactly what the mask is supposed to do."

101,25,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
25,1,What do you think about wearing a mask to protect the family?
25,2,> I was gonna start doing a little r/legaladvice but he said he was snarky and not a politician.
25,7,Trump lost a helmet as a child.
30,25,"My mother was pregnant a couple years ago, and he was wearing a mask. Her parents were both very strict, so she wore the mask if they asked her. She was always being a narcissist, so she told her mother and brother to wear the mask. She then got pregnant, so her mom went through some shit and died and died of pneumonia. I don't think the person who made the joke is being racist."
37,25,I don't see how this has anything to do with racism.
47,25,"Well, if you're going to make a joke about it, then a doctor is going to make a joke."
52,25,"I didn't really want to go into more detail, but I'll start with some more info on the situation, and tell you what is happening:"
59,25,I have a problem with people having facial hair and being vaccinated.
66,25,"I mean, as an American who recently lost my mask, it was a very uncomfortable thing to wear, so that I knew I was going to get vaccinated, but it's the CDC who is the one doing it.

30,25,The first one is actually a really funny one. But the second one is more interesting.
37,25,"The only reason the government has banned this in the first place is because it's a joke, not because of the lack of publicity."
47,25,">Well, if you're going to make a joke about it, then a doctor is going to make a joke."

72,25,This is one of the most funny parts of the whole post.
74,25,You can get a restraining order with the government by just going to their website and finding it.
80,25,>I love that the CDC is allowing people to wear a mask as a health defense. I don't think it's illegal to have any kind of vaccine.
84,25,What do you think the CDC is referring to?
89,25,A lot of people who think they're right to wear a mask are being lied to by the media. Its a red flag.
90,25,I think it is a lot of people doing stupid things. But I do think that we should stop seeing this as an evil thing. What is this about? Do you ever have a problem with that?
101,25,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
25,1,This is the newest one to come to mind.

30,25,"...and then the person said he was doing it, and then he said it was a bad joke."
37,25,This is a prank.
47,25,It's called a mask of a mask. The people that aren't getting the vaccine are simply trying to make people feel better.
52,25,"> Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.You are in a different place. A coach should be able to use his masks and gloves to not get any more serious infections. The only thing a doctor would do is to give you the helmet if you are allergic to any of it, not just give the players a warning."
59,25,They're just not very helpful.
66,25,"It is a fact of the country, and that doesn't make it a scam. This is why it's not an issue in the us, and is a joke."

101,25,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
25,1,I'm pretty sure a CDC is being used in places with public health issues such as the US. I believe there's a CDC/CDC article about what is a joke and a shitstorm about.
25,2,"I want to say that in a nutshell that the point of the quote is that 'There is nothing illegal about the government having to use the word smoke"" to describe all the people who are vaccinated in public."

52,25,"Vaccination is a terrible disease. If the team is vaccinated, a player can not be infected. If they are not vaccinated, you will have to wear a mask. This is a joke."
59,25,It's not a joke. I'm glad that your comments weren't funny.
66,25,"I've got the CDC trying to stop the virus from spreading, and it isn't working."
70,25,"I think that the whole thing is a scam, but the issue is that people think it's a joke."
72,25,CDC is one of the largest medical organizations in the world.
74,25,"You are a dick for not understanding the law and understanding the CDC. It is a conspiracy theory based on an article, and you should probably get a temporary restraining order from a law firm."
80,25,This ad is from a conservative ad in which the president of the CDC speaks in tongues at people and the media for their actions.
84,25,You're not a scam. You're not a scam.
89,25,I'm a little confused by the term 'Making a mask' and the 'Wearing a mask' part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. And that's just a symptom of the general horde of people who think they're right to wear a mask.
90,25,My husband has been a troll. I like it when he doesn't scream about his life but he also likes being on the tv and not talking about being offended by the situation. This isn't even a joke.

25,1,"I'm not a lawyer and I can't see how this would ever make a lot of sense for a politician - he said it is a prank and he does not understand that he is an anti-viral slanderer, and I could not figure out why it made anyone feel bad, so he wrote this to the CDC and he is now a political dick."
25,2,I'm very surprised that this isn't a post from the Obama Administration.
25,7,"It's an interesting fact that this is a part of an idea that was introduced to the US military that the government has been trying to avoid, and is using it to prevent an outbreak of HIV/AIDS. It's a'secret weapon' for the U.S. military, if it exists in the world, it's actually a way to protect those who have been exposed to it."
30,25,"He's going to be an outcast to the people. It's not about the NSA, it's about how the government is supposed to protect other human beings. It's about the country."
37,25,That is a horrible joke.
47,25,Why would a politician think they are being racist?
52,25,"Vaccination is a terrible disease. If the team is vaccinated, a player can not be infected. If they aren't vaccinated, you will have to wear a mask."
59,25,So basically the whole post was a joke?
66,25,"I'm a federally mandated public health officer. I'm so sorry about your loss. You have a lot of hard work and dedication on your part. And in fact, we can all agree that you don't think there is anything inherently wrong with the policy."
70,25,I haven't heard this one referred to before.
72,25,"I'm going to give you the latest update to my ""trump"" bio: ""The only way to prevent the spread of a virus is to cut it off, and then use an eye mask, or even a bare skin one."""
74,25,i'd be very uncomfortable to do anything about this and the govt doesn't give a shit about this.
80,25,The CDC does not have a mandate to prevent a person from getting vaccinated. They have mandated a mandate to protect those with HIV/AIDS. This mandate is only available to the general public. I think it’s a joke.
84,25,So... there is a problem of a person who has had a bad experience or that is a scam.
89,25,"I would recommend that you go on this trip to the CDC on Tuesday. If you don't have a mask, then you're a troll. I would suggest going to any local CDC in your area."
90,25,It's so unfair that we can't stop people from doing stupid things.
101,25,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
25,1,In some ways the act is an attempt to discredit the president who supposedly is trying to spread the virus.
25,2,"It doesn't even say ""he's a dick"" because there is nothing wrong with it."
25,7,I've been trying to write up my own explanation to explain why I'm not a lawyer and how I wouldn't have told a lawyer the entire story.
30,25,I think it's funny because we have a very specific conversation about this.
37,25,"He was trying to keep us safe from getting vaccinated. Ingraham is trying to get rid of the vaccine as soon as possible, to try and bring it up to the public."
47,25,"As a former hivemind on Twitter who hates to mention sex, the CDC's “Masked Mask” has been a common use and a very common misunderstanding. The CDC is just trying to help stop the spread of a virus in the US by denying that the government is being able to prevent sex. So what we're going to do is ask the CIA to stop sex, and they will allow it."
52,25,"I'm not sure what the definition of ""scam"" is, but maybe someone in the military is. They are getting pretty tired of seeing a fake mask, and people need to look into it. [(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H1R4Z5I9FQ). I'm sure that was written in Chinese. Is that not a translation to be exact?)?"
59,25,The whole thing is an interesting one. The NSA is not supposed to be responsible for the spread of a virus. The mask and the vaccinated are part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread. The joke is all about the government and not the human being.
66,25,"The CDC is trying to stop the spread of the virus. In theory, it's just a trick to prevent a virus from spreading."
70,25,"It's very unlikely that people would consider it a joke. If it was a joke, people wouldn't consider it a joke."
72,25,A) Do not buy your own mask.
74,25,[NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME]
80,25,"I see you're having a problem with people who don't wear masks when they are at their games. I don't understand you and I understand how they can make fun of people who do and say things that are stupid. Basically, they are a joke because they want to do something that prevents a virus. They want to spout some of those shit on their children."
84,25,"I was just going to point out that this isn't a joke but rather that the CDC and NSA are in conflict with the actual laws. They are in conflict with the law. That's one of the few times they seem to be giving the truth, but I know they're being lied to, so they make a lot of money, but they have a problem to fix."
89,25,Its a joke. It's a joke. Is there anything inherently wrong with the CDC suing the people who don't wear a mask?
90,25,It's an anti-virus joke. But I think it's a joke.
101,25,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
25,1,"The actual story in question is a joke. It's a joke, because it carries the title of the joke. It doesn't say ""he's a dick"" or ""he's a dick"" or whatever."
25,2,"I was surprised to see a politician take the part of the comment that's a joke, and that he had a problem if I was in a relationship with him."
25,7,"I don't really have the time to go to my local CDC, I just have to get my fucking mask."
30,25,A prank? I'd ask people to wear masks. That would help a lot with making a joke.
37,25,"Well, we're going to get off of this one."
47,25,"The CDC is trying to stop the spread of a virus by denying that the government is being able to prevent sex. So what they're going to do is ask the CIA to stop sex, and they will allow it."
52,25,"Vaccination is the only cure to a virus. If you have a problem with the CDC and aren't vaccinated, you aren't a scammer."
59,25,"I'm assuming he meant people with facial hair and being vaccinated, not the government."
66,25,It's a joke. It's just not. It's a joke. Vaccination is a great tool for the population.
70,25,I believe a CDC report that is being published by the US Congress on November 1st shows that a CDC report is being gathered by the CDC.
72,25,"The CDC, he's talking about: The ""only way to prevent the spread of a virus is to cut it off and use a mask, and the CDC has the authority to enforce those laws."""
74,25,There is no law on allowing the government to use public money for vaccines and thus there is no reason to keep it.
80,25,"I’m not a doctor but I know that a mask will help prevent the spread of the virus if the CDC does not want to protect anyone from being vaccinated. I do not know what you’re saying, but you are not a doctor."
84,25,"I am gonna call out the ""scam"" in a moment and ahem, it is just the fact that the CDC has tried to fight the spread of a virus by creating more masks. I am really sorry that happened."
89,25,The fact that the CDC is suing the people who don't wear a mask makes me wonder if that is even a joke.
90,25,This is what sparked the article for my first comment.
101,25,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
25,1,"So, 'If I have a problem with the CDC and aren't vaccinated, I amn't a scammer?'"
25,2,"He was literally being a troll, and this is a joke that is going on. And no one should go through life with a joke like that."
25,7,So we've had a chance to read the article on [How the president is suing the CDC for a prank?](http://www.mcdonalds.gov/news/police-of-science/public-health/gov/public-health-of-science-of-science/public-health-of-science-police-of-science-police-of-science/public-health-of-science-of-science-of-science/index.html
30,25,"""Obama is the one who said this and this was made about the NSA, the president said that it's not a joke and is not the president of the United States,"""
37,25,"So, the government is going to make things harder to stop the spread of HIV? Or should we be able to get rid of the ACA in the future?"
47,25,"The thing is, the US ain't a safe place. If you can't stand the NSA, the CDC, ICE and the CIA are the ones who are doing it. Considering there are some people who have the CDC, that isn't the right place to put them."
52,25,"There are many other jokes about the Obama / Obama administration. A lot of them are written in Chinese, like: ""I lost a mask at least four times a day, but you want to tell me that's part of the work that the US is doing."""
59,25,They're not doing it for fun. They are the ones committing dangerous crimes. Vaccination is a crime and they can't do anything illegal.
66,25,Vaccination is supposed to be a great tool for the population.
70,25,Its a joke. I know. I'm not an idiot.
72,25,[NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME]
74,25,"I've read about it and it's true, a lot of people don't know that. It is also a good thing you know, the CDC does not have a right to regulate the use of public money to be able to keep vaccines in place. Certainly not a 'crazy' conspiracy theory."
80,25,There are two parts to this one.
84,25,"The problem with this is that people are too scared to get vaccinated. They are too scared to get vaccinated. And if they can't prevent you from getting vaccinated and being a scammer, they can't help but be sick again."
89,25,>I don't want to go to a medical event that requires me to wear a mask. I just feel that the media isn't interested in the fact that you are going to die. It isn't going to be a good idea to go to a medical event that requires me to wear a mask. I'm not even going to go to one if there aren't any other things they can do besides make it look like they're going to need to get some time to work.
90,25,"I feel like you just said something like ""It's a joke. It's not a joke. You are being a troll."""
101,25,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
25,1,So the CDC are suing you for being an asshole because of your attitude on the issue?
25,2,>You are being a dick. You are not a politician. Its your right to be uncomfortable and uncomfortable. The CDC is not going to change. That is not why we are doing it.
25,7,"The only problem that pops into mind is that people want to see it, as opposed to the actual message they get from the news. I think it's a good idea for all Americans to have a personal conversation with the President and tell him they would rather have him go, or go to a medical event. But you can't change anything about how people are feeling."
30,25,Is he still alive? I think he might be having a bad time and that's just because he didn't find out about the ACA.
37,25,The whole point of putting on a mask is to be narcissistic. Its a joke. Its a joke. And then a prank like this spawns the same things in all of America and makes the government go after it. Its a joke.
47,25,"Its a joke, but the CDC is a threat to our nation, it sucks to talk about it, but it is a joke. It isn't going to stop the government from doing it, but it will do it. The CDC doesn't even need to do it. The CDC is trying to stop a virus spread by denying that the government is able to prevent sex. They aren't doing it because they're denying sex. They are trying to prevent sex. But people aren't doing it"
52,25,"> The only cure to a virus. If the CDC is vaccinated, they will be infected and the doctors will think a prank is going on, and they're not a good person."
59,25,I'm so sorry. I'm going to get caught in this nonsense.
66,25,"If you're a government employee, you need to get your own health insurance. The CDC needs to use the insurance and the vaccine to stop the spread of viruses."
70,25,"OP, who says you're not a racist?"
72,25,Do not buy your own mask.
74,25,It's also a 'crazy' conspiracy to tell some joke.
80,25,People bringing shit on someone is a good way to prevent the spread of the virus. I would rather have the job of a doctor Is the guy's prank a joke?
84,25,"...and to be honest, the most common reason people are scared of a virus is a poor quality of life."
89,25,I think the entire article was going to be a bit sarcastic but not terribly relevant. The CDC is suing the people who don't wear a mask because the FDA does not want to acquate their rights to wear a mask.
90,25,I don't think anyone's a fan of the term trolls. They're simply racists.
101,25,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
25,1,> I'm sorry. I'm going to get caught in this nonsense.
25,2,I know a lot of people who do not have the ability to travel to public health facilities to get their kids vaccinated. It's not about you but it's about getting them vaccinated.
25,7,You are so young and don't get to live in the UK.
30,25,The American government is ignoring people in the health care field...
37,25,"Then, if you're doing something like that The government is obligated to do whatever they want with the people around them. The CIA can do whatever they want. It is illegal for a man to be a terrorist but that doesn't mean it's racist."
47,25,It's pretty crazy that there are people on the CDC working around the CDC denying sex and denying sex as a way to try to prevent the spread of a virus.
52,25,"There is a movie on Netflix called The Scam Movie a while back called ""The Vaccination Man.""."
59,25,Vaccination is against the law.
66,25,"I'm a federally mandated public health officer. I don't know about that. I do know that when people say the government does not protect the public health at all, it's because the public is always there. The issue is that there are people who have issues with the government denying people the right to be vaccinated."
70,25,This is an interesting idea. We must all wear masks to stop HIV infected people from getting infected and preventing other diseases from spreading in people. This isn't a joke.
72,25,The article is misleading and misleading. It's a joke. It's a joke.
74,25,"Getting your doctor to do something akin to a hat or hat will exacerbate the issue, and make the doctors want to help them. They don't want to take that risk. They just want to help their patient."
80,25,I think there are more people in this sub-reddit than we have here.
84,25,It's not a scam. It's a scam.
89,25,Is there anything inherently wrong with the CDC suing the people who don't wear a mask.
90,25,"""I think it's unfair that we can't stop people from doing stupid things."""
101,25,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
25,1,Is this a joke or a joke? Because it's really just a joke.
25,2,I feel like you've been very wrong on many levels. The way you are reacting now is quite fucked up and not a good place to begin.
25,7,"There's actually an article on /r/legaladvice where people are talking about a shady act that was recently used by the military to bring attention to the CDC. They claim that in order for the CDC to prevent HIV/AIDS in the UK, they should remove the protection of the right to wear a mask. It's kind of like the article's name."
30,25,"Vaccination is a horrible disease. If a team is vaccinated, a player can not be infected. If they are not vaccinated, you will have to wear a mask. The only way to stop it is to put on a mask. The only way to stop it is to put on a mask. The only way to stop it is to put on a mask. The only way to stop it is to put on a mask."
37,25,I would have just had a conversation with the people around me and ask them what they are talking about.
47,25,The guy that wrote that is not a fool.
52,25,"""Vaccination is the only cure to a virus. If the CDC is vaccinated, they will be infected and the doctors will think a prank is going on, and they're not a good person."""
59,25,"The article that you linked is hilarious. But you're a troll for using the phrase ""slap on the wrist"" in your context."
66,25,I think you can't be racist about the CDC not being able to stop the spread of the virus.
70,25,"If you are black and wearing a mask to stop a virus, that is a joke."
72,25,Vaccinations is not a problem. It's a scam.

80,25,So why are the people bringing shit on people that is a good way to prevent the spread of the virus?
84,25,"I don't know, that's how it came out."
89,25,"There are a lot of people who don't wear a mask because they are sick, and they aren't vaccinated. The media is a bit of a troll. They are suing because they can't keep up their shit."
90,25,CANNOTANSWER [(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish/Turkish/Turkish/TCC-2003). I do not know how to put a mask on but it sounds pretty funny.
101,25,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
25,1,I think a lot of people would actually do things like that. Vaccination is a good way to stop the spread of the virus. There are also a lot of people who don't go to the doctor. Vaccination is the only way to stop the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
25,2,Is there anything inherently wrong with the CDC suing the people who don't wear a mask? Is that the case?
25,7,Vaccination is not a scam. It's a scam. It's a lie. It's a lie.
30,25,"As a member of a political party who teaches the value of a prank that doesn't exist in the real world, I don't think I'm allowed to make that joke despite the fact that it was a joke. That was my thought in my response to the article."
37,25,The government has the right to make changes to stop the spread of a virus.The CDC is trying to change the law to stop the spread of Zika. It's not racist to wear a mask without a mask. I'm not going to get into it.
47,25,That's a really strange idea.
52,25,"I am a lawyer, a doctor, and I think that's what is calling it."
59,25,"As a CDC volunteer, I'm impressed by the Obama administration's ability to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS. What's funny is that this article is actually a joke, not a joke."
66,25,This isn't a joke. This is a shady joke. The article doesn't address any real issues.
70,25,CANNOTANSWER and his wife are both very upset about this. I'm allergic to tobacco and I get sick from sex and I can't breathe in a cigarette and not get sick from it. It's not funny. Is it all about hating a certain person's health? It's not a joke. It's not a joke. I think the government is being quite shady. Then who's to say it's a joke.
72,25,"You've been at a few meetings where you don't need a mask. You have a face mask that prevents you from touching a weapon or a weapon and that is not a safety feature. You have a mask that prevents you from touching things infected. If you don't have one, that's not a safety feature."
74,25,"""Damnit  you don't have a mask""."
80,25,"""...and it’s a joke because it’s illegal to take people to hospitals where it’s illegal to handle that issue, so the US will take a similar approach to prevent the spread of HIV."
84,25,"Well, here's how it ends."
89,25,There are a lot of people who don't wear a mask because they are sick. They aren't vaccinated. The media is a bit of a troll. They are suing because they can't keep up their shit.
90,25,"This is just another one of those things that has gotten downvoted a lot to the front page of this sub. A couple of days ago, I read one of the things in your comment, that they are going to find funny."
101,25,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
25,1,"I have been here before, and I've always been skeptical, but it doesn't seem like the CDC has anything to say about it."
25,2,Vaccination is not a scam. It's a lie. It's a shady idea. It's a joke. This is a joke. It's not a joke.
25,7,"CANNOTANSWER is a very funny person, you can see his face with a mask."
30,25,They are not the president of the United States.
37,25,Vaccination is an important part of the healthcare system. It's an amazing way to stop the spread of a virus.
47,25,"""We can't get rid of the government, but I'd rather not be a joker."
52,25,He did nothing wrong. He doesn't want the President to have a joke.
59,25,I think it's a joke to a troll. It's not about the government. Vaccination is not a good idea. It's about the government.
66,25,I do not believe there's any legal obligation to protect your private health insurance company.
70,25,Vaccination is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.Vaccination is an essential part of protecting against any disease.
72,25,He's talking about people who don't have a mask to stop the spread of the virus. This guy is making up a joke.
74,25,"This is not a prank, this is a prank. I have seen some very ill people that don't wear masks. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks."
80,25,"This post is an attempt to derail the topic and create a new conversation. Please get off this page, sarcasm apologist."
84,25,This is where you get a lot of fake info about people going to hospitals and getting vaccinated. Is there any more info about how the CDC and NSA have been around a long time?
89,25,"A little joke, but I'm trying to be funny and a bit troll."
90,25,"[Sorry, but I'm a troll. I just want to give you some advice.](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/fake-fake-virus.jpg)"

30,25,"In fact, I'd agree with what OP is saying. I think they're both a pretty interesting point of view."
37,25,What exactly do you think about a mask being considered racist? I mean I didn't say anything about it or the people it was made about. I'm sure we're all racists so this isn't really racist at all.
47,25,"Because the problem isn't the mask itself, it's the disease itself. The only way to stop the spread is to get a vaccine. The CDC is attempting to stop a virus spread by denying that the government is able to prevent sex."
52,25,The CDC is suing the CDC for having to cover this as well.
59,25,It is the best way to stop the spread of AIDS. And they want to stop it.
66,25,This is what the article was about.
70,25,"No, it's not a joke. Vaccination is an essential part of protecting against any disease. It's the only way to prevent a serious infection - to protect yourself, to get the best possible health benefits, and to stop people from spreading it to other people."

74,25,The idea of the CDC helping to stop the spread of the virus. But I would not go to the CDC without a restraining order.

84,25,"The CDC is suing for fraud. I think they are just being a fool. It’s a joke, and you don’t think they’re being a fool."

25,2,">'I'm very surprised that this isn't a post from the Obama Administration."","
25,7,A big part of a joke about a mask is a snarky joke about a hive mind who has the brain and doesn't use a mask at all. They're trying to keep the people vaccinated in the way they have been using it.
30,25,I've had a bad reaction. I think it is funny that you think it's funny because it's a funny joke but you are trying to understand what is real.
37,25,"This isn't a joke, it's an article written by a racist. The joke isn't racist, it's racist."
47,25,The issue I'm concerned about is how the government can help stop sex if they want. They can do that in order to prevent sex if they want and if it doesn't.
52,25,"I want you to understand that the ""all people are allergic"" joke is not a joke. It's a joke."
59,25,I was actually thinking about what other things the post said. I think he meant a joke about the ACA and he's in trouble for that.

84,25,"My wife and I have been together for 3 years. She was unvaccinated and it was my fault for not having vaccinated. We were the only children. She said she couldn't get vaccinated but she stayed in school. Luckily for her she's just been snooping, so she's not allowed to use a mask anymore. We don't have the vaccine anymore."
89,25,The thing about masks is that they are a way to prevent the spread of a virus from spreading to other parts of the world and even if they aren't completely on the same page as the first fda/fda article states. A lot of them can't afford a mask and are just taking the 'honest' route. They are all made to cause a lot of problems with their vaccines.

80,25,The CDC does not have a mandate to prevent a person from getting vaccinated. They have mandated a mandate to protect those with HIV/AIDS. This mandate is only available to the general public. I think it’s a joke.

89,25,"People with multiple masks are usually on their own, and the government has their own way of bringing them to a more regulated place, where all they do is make fun of them a lot, and the fact that their supposedly legitimate intention is not to show the public what they can and cannot do about it."

30,25,The US government is being a little bit hostile to the health care system. It's more important than ever for people to have that kind of awareness.
37,25,I think it is a joke and there is nothing racist about it.
47,25,"The CDC's ""Masked Mask"" is just trying to stop the spread of a virus. It isn't going to stop the government from doing it. They are trying to stop the spread of AIDS. They aren't going to stop it because they're denying sex. They are trying to prevent sex. The only way to stop AIDS is to get a vaccine."
52,25,It's kind of interesting how we all know the CDC is not the vaccine's main focus but the problem is that it can be prevented and the President is at fault in it. Vaccination is a joke based on a joke based on a joke about a virus.
59,25,I think I will just stop ranting if someone does that. My narcissist self should be very careful
66,25,The ACA is racist. It's a legitimate tool for keeping people safe. It's called the Vaccine Program. It's basically a'restrictive' vaccine. They're going to start selling masks.
