59,5,I can't wait for the next twitchcon!
84,5,The CDC would like to know if anyone is going to say it's a scam.
85,5,I wear a mask to see if I've ever been in a situation where I haven't smoked or felt any pain before I have smoked. I'm so mad that I have to wear a mask.
89,5,I hate to be so entrusted to you.

15,5,You’re a fraud. This is a scam.

52,5,"> I lost a mask twice in a day. This whole thing is a scam. I'm a vaccinated person with boosters, and I know what to do, but I always think that it's not a bad thing to wear a mask. That's why I've done a few mask shirts, shaved my head and threw in a bunch of my teeth before shit was leaking out of the air. I'm not sure what the definition of ""scam"" is, but maybe someone in the military is."

59,5,"If you're not a professional or any kind of guy he can't stand, then you're not the one. The guy just wants the job done."
84,5,This is an interesting and serious post. Here is how to get the message across:
85,5,I was given a ring with my mask on.
89,5,I hate the whole putting on a mask thing
94,5,"a lot of people, including myself, who are not familiar with this issue, will be able to use an excuse to change their masks. They just don't think of them as being a good choice for their teams because it's their job to protect them."
15,5,"This is a scam. Unless you’re talking about a person who is trying to get their children to stop a virus, I don’t think the president actually knows what a mask is. I do know he said that he did that, and that you need to tell him that."
16,5,">""The guy who says it's ok not to wear a mask was in the post on his site, that he doesn't wear a mask."" So, you don't want your health shattered? That's a big one, but I don't really like the guy who is trying to make it worse, which is a little ridiculous. There's one book about her about how people who do not know what to wear in the US are attempting to prevent people from being vaccinated."
52,5,I don't think anyone who is in the military would be able to afford to buy a mask to stop someone getting a virus. It would be a good idea to show them the mask and give them an explanation for their behavior.
55,5,"I'm an RN, and this is my first year in RN school and I wore a mask in my maternity ward. It had a really tight fitting fit and was not too tight. My RN teacher and I were both in a similar situation. I haven't been to a vaccination clinic in my entire life."
59,5,"My friend is a doctor in Florida, who had a brain tumour because he had a facial hair mask on. He was born and raised in Texas. I've never had that problem before."
84,5,It sounds like he's just trying to protect his family by saying he is going to continue doing that without causing problems for people who need to learn to use a mask.
85,5,"There's a book called ""The Devil Wears a Mask"" starring Tim Curry that does that as well - this has some pretty good movies."
89,5,You are going to die. I love you
94,5,I was vaccinated.
15,5,I'm so sorry. But we need to see where we go.
16,5,"And you've read the AMA. It has a lot of details id be interested to hear more about, and that would be good to have a good conversation with a teammate."
52,5,"I just don't get it. There are so many things that the government can hide from the public, but the thing is, we do the right thing and the government can't do the right thing. I guess I can't make it a legal thing and the government can't do anything about it."
55,5,">Trump said it's ok not to wear a mask, and Ingraham said it's restricting our rights to keep us locked inside! You know our right to die and infect (kill) others. Why isn't Ms. Ingraham out there with them."
59,5,You should do what they can to prevent the spread of a virus. I've had a lot of success with masks being used in the military.
84,5,The way the CDC wants to do this is to help prevent the spread of the virus.
85,5,...and now I just don't understand how they can have a person that can't read a book or use their computer properly?
89,5,"It is important to note that people in the US do not have the right to wear a mask, and that it does not prevent the spread of viruses. It is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
94,5,"IANAL, but when they ask me if I'm the official vaccinated coach I tell them I don't have to wear a mask and the answer is no, they just don't care. I was vaccinated."
15,5,A mask is a way to protect yourself from all forms of infections. A mask is a way to keep someone from becoming sick because they're allergic to a product they aren't wearing. There are so many things in that one can actually be harmful.
16,5,There's also a book about Obama who talks about this:
52,5,A lot of people whose parents and kids are actually military have not considered the medical issue as a legitimate legitimate problem.
55,5,It's been a long time since I've been on the Internet for this exact reason.
59,5,They just don't have the moral authority to make their decisions about whether or not to put on a mask.
84,5,"I've lost a lot of masks and the CDC is one of the few agencies that has a lot of people on their radar if they think they are safe. I'm not sure if they were a scam, but I don't know if they were the ones that gave it away or even the ones that tried to help us in our dealings."
85,5,So he's an idiot who needs a mask for personal stuff.
89,5,"The FDA doesn't acquate the rights of Americans to wear a mask, it enacts anti-virus law, and the medical community has a right to refuse it to anyone. I'm not going to quote that in the context of that comment - I don't think any of them are Americans."
94,5,I'm very sorry but I didn't even think that it was an official job.
15,5,"In a nutshell, he said in his book, ""[i] Wearing a mask to break a tree"" that it would be a great way to read that he's not a fan of his work or his life. If that's a valid reason for him to get a mask, he has to be told he is a ""devil wearer"" and will probably be able to read it. Yes, he does not. He's a repressive president who is a dick."
16,5,I've actually had a few contacts who had a few friends who would wear masks and would have been more concerned about that kind of thing than I was with them. It was all on the same page on the internet.
52,5,I don't understand why I was getting downvoted because I thought it was a joke.
55,5,">I'm not surprised at all. Vaccination is not a policy of the government, it's a fact that a person will always be a part of the country."
59,5,"In an emergency that I didn't notice was the white house putting a mask on and preventing the spread of a virus, this article tells you that."
84,5,"I volunteered at a local medical center and they've been trying to get me to be vaccinated, if I wear a mask when I play football and then a month or two later I can go to the health clinic and find out how to protect myself without spouting blood and coughing. They also have an online AMA."
85,5,"It's the CDC and a film. It's a book. The movie & book are pretty good, if he's looking for a new place to live."
89,5,"A lot of people who think they're right to wear a mask (like a terrorist, just that they're part of the problem) think they're right to wear a mask to prevent people from getting sick, or get vaccinated, and even just to see how bad the situation is when they're on the verge of dying."
94,5,I don't know why but I really don't think it's even possible to do it at all. That's my problem.
15,5,"CANNOTANSWER AN AXE, TO BACK UP! A virus and other anti-vaccine drugs don't have to be the same, and the people who do aren't at risk. I think that the phrase 'I want to go home, but I'm not going to go back to school' is way overrated. It's a joke. They are telling us the truth and I don't think they are even able to make them aware. In other words, the government has given people a mask in order to stop the spread of "
16,5,">We do this for people, not for those who are vaccinated."
52,5,"Yes, I'm in the military. It's a pretty serious concern, but the US military is still an interesting place to be in, as far as I know, because they're really pretty stupid. So i'm going to be honest and say that they don't really know what to do about it, and because of that, there is something to be said that they haven't done and it's too time-consuming."
55,5,I've never heard of this. But I don't know if I'll ever know how much more it's worth.
59,5,What is a good way to get to the top? The government does not have the right to enforce their policies.
84,5,"The CDC isn't going to stop the spread of a virus because the mask isn't up to a level of safety. The CDC is going to try and make sure that people know that the masks are actually fake and that this has been done to protect the country, not a government agency."
85,5,"It's interesting that you've all said the book is a good example of how people can read their own personal life, and then make money off of it."
89,5,I'm pretty sure that the article is about the FDA suing you.
94,5,I'm a teacher and I am not a professional coach.
15,5,This sounds like a pretty good premise for a movie.
16,5,"""They are trying to get rid of the president's mask because it's the best thing to happen to the people and is actually going to put on a mask in the first place?"
52,5,"It sounds like the President has a problem with what the NSA is doing with this stuff. I've tried wearing a mask before, but it doesn't work. I'm pretty sure it does work with your nose."
55,5,It is a scam. The government is not able to stop the spread of a virus. They do not seem to be that racist.
59,5,I've been in a few interviews. But I think they're just trying to get everyone to know what to do. It seems like the only thing to be good about it is a restraining order.
84,5,"""Foolish"" is a slang term for a phrase used to describe someone with a CDC membership who has received HIV/AIDS, as well as a number of other virally induced diseases."
85,5,"They just don't have the money. The movie could be good. OP is a fan of the book, and his book makes the movie great."
89,5,"""The FDA doesn't acquate the rights of Americans to wear a mask, it enacts anti-virus law, and the medical community has a right to refuse it to anyone."""
94,5,"I’m going to go to the NFL this weekend, because I’m a teacher and a coach."
15,5,As a Republican I really think this is a lot more believable than the original and most unpopular meme.
16,5,It's a real thing.
52,5,It's a joke. The question is whether a coach can be offended by it.
55,5,A guy who had a fucking brain in his 30s who had no idea what he was doing in school had a brain. He was going to say he was a fucking RN. He'd been getting into a mental illness for 30 years.
59,5,"I agree with the previous paragraph that you're over thinking a restraining order. This sounds like a bunch of insanity, but the truth is the only thing that gets you to say it."
84,5,This isn't just about the government. This is about the CIA and NSA.
85,5,Honestly I'd love to see a movie about this. I think it would be great to see the author in a movie. I just don't think people are being sarcastic about this.
89,5,"I think the ""recent"" stories are mostly about the media saying ""Waiting a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.'"
94,5,"Vaccination is terrible. Vaccination is terrible. If the team is vaccinated, a player can not be infected. If they are not vaccinated, you will have to wear a mask."
15,5,Well the CDC is not doing the thing but it's going to have a huge impact on people that aren't vaccinated.
16,5,You're being sarcastic. This is a real thing.
52,5,"There's a difference between being offended by a joke and a joke. The president has a problem with what the NSA is doing with this stuff. Vaccination is a terrible disease. If the team is vaccinated, a player can not be infected. If they are not vaccinated, you will have to wear a mask. The only way to stop it is to put on a mask so you can be vaccinated and that is a good idea."
55,5,The US is a dangerous country and it is illegal for people with a CDC license to have a virus. If you are a civilian and not going to work in this country you are doing everything possible to get rid of it.
59,5,> I'm glad that your comments weren't funny.
84,5,People get sick and die on the streets by wearing masks to stop HIV.
85,5,I read his book based on a book.
89,5,"You're really the guy stating the obvious, not the fact that the CDC is suing the people who don't wear a mask. Unless the CDC is asking for them to go to the CDC and they're making you think a person is going to die because of a mask? It's possible that they don't want you to wear a mask and it's not the same as the CDC saying ""We should have the people who can't make this a ""regular"" joke."
94,5,"I am not sure that people are able to stop this. This is just ridiculous. Vaccination is terrible. Vaccination is terrible. If the team is vaccinated, a player can not be infected. If they aren't vaccinated, you will have to wear a mask."
15,5,"I'm not referring to that. I'm referring to the CDC's actions - not to a CDC official - which is why their policy is such a lie. But when it comes to vaccines, it's not to say ""I don't think a mask isn't necessary for the prevention of any epidemic."""
16,5,I don't think that's what is wrong with your claim.
52,5,"Vaccination is a terrible disease. If the team is vaccinated, a player can not be infected. If they are not vaccinated, you will have to wear a mask. The only way to stop it is to put on a mask so you can be vaccinated and that is a good idea."
55,5,"Well, if you are a civilian and not going to work in this country you are doing everything possible to get rid of it."
59,5,"[Dad.. I am going to get my shit together, my team isn't doing anything I don't want to.. but I want to.. What's next? No, I won't go and leave... it's not a joke. You should go to CDC to be warned.."
84,5,"No, it's not a scam. A virus can't spread quickly enough for you to actually be vaccinated."
85,5,"It sounds like the author is probably just an idiot who needs a mask for personal stuff, and has a tendency to say the same thing, but it seems like he was trying to get out of the situation, and he just didn't make it into a movie."
89,5,"I think that they are addressing an issue that has been overshadowed by the CDC and the medical community - or at least the CDC has been working on, but I'm not convinced that any of these other people who have a problem with the FDA are just as narcissists."
94,5,"If the team is vaccinated, a player can not be infected. If they aren't vaccinated, you will have to wear a mask."
15,5,This is a great premise for the movie.
16,5,"The President is a prankster, but the guy is a prankster. He is a prankster, and the guy is a prankster."
52,5,"Vaccination is a terrible disease. If the team is vaccinated, a player can not be infected. If they aren't vaccinated, you will have to wear a mask. The only way to stop it is to put on a mask so you can be vaccinated and that is a good idea."
55,5,This is not really a big deal. The president wants a lot of things to be done by the NSA.
59,5,I've been in several interviews. This is why I get nervous when I make decisions.
84,5,"There's a lot of misconception that the government isn't preventing the spread of HIV. But, I don't believe that a lot of people are at risk for a virus and it's not something that anyone can do."
85,5,They’re all sarcastic because they’re not the first person to say it.
89,5,"""We have the right to wear a mask and we have a right to refuse it to anyone."""
94,5,"""When I was in the NFL, I was a coach. You are the greatest coach in the world and I want you to know that."""
15,5,">If I were a doctor, I wouldn't wear a mask on people with an illness or a medical condition (with a virus) so I wouldn't need to be a doctor."
16,5,"Because the president is a prankster, and the president is a prankster."
52,5,I think the point is that the president can't be in the military's position - he isn't being a dick - and that's not a good idea.
55,5,The US government is not going to change it. The US government is not going to change it.
59,5,"Vaccines are an essential part of health care and it makes your lives more likely to have a high chance of getting sick. Keeping a body alive is a basic human right. It's an incredibly important distinction between ""humans"" and ""badmen."""
84,5,"Isn't a mask just a mask that a CDC member wants to keep in an AMA? Like, if a man isn't going to keep wearing them he needs to put them on. I'd say that's a good idea as it's not as simple as a mask but rather just a more common part of the joke."
85,5,Exactly what I was thinking.
89,5,"I'm talking about a really good idea. I would recommend that you go on this trip to the CDC on Tuesday. If you don't wear a mask, then you're a troll."
94,5,"I think that the only way to stop a joke like this is to have the coach tell you that ""When I was in the NFL, I was a coach. You are the greatest coach in the world and I want you to know that."""
15,5,It’s a fake. A mask can keep people from being infected and doctors are going to think they’re not at risk.
16,5,"I don't really think this is a real thing, but I don't really think that's what is wrong with your claim."
52,5,The president isn't a joke. His statement is a joke.
55,5,"The problem is not the mask, it's the health issue. A racist would be able to get behind a conspiracy theory that the CIA and CIA are the government to stop the spread of a virus."
59,5,"This was my naivete, and I cried when I got into the office of a Democrat."
84,5,I was talking to someone today that actually lost a mask.
85,5,"*You* were in a movie, if you didn't get a real answer."
89,5,>The CDC is suing the people who don't wear a mask.
94,5,"I mean, it's a joke. It's not a joke, it's a fact that the NFL uses a bunch of lying lies to protect the public from the spread of a virus, which is part of why it's terrible."
15,5,The government is trying to force you to make a'shameful joke'. It's not the joke itself. It's the joke. It's a joke. 'The president is a ripoff of Obama. '
16,5,"If I were the president, I wouldn't wear a mask at work, I'd be a prankster."
52,5,"Vaccination is a terrible disease. If people aren't vaccinated, they will be infected and the doctors will think a prank is going on, and they're not a good person."
55,5,I don't think any of the docs are all very good at making the point that the CIA and CIA are the problem. They've been around all of this and in many cases were actually pretty good.
59,5,"Why would you wear a mask, not the actual one, with your hat on?"
84,5,No one would like to know if the CDC is going to be able to protect themselves from the spread of HIV.
85,5,There is a wiki article about the CDC making a movie about the devil wears a mask.
89,5,I don't think there is a law requiring a person to wear a mask to be able to see what the virus is. I think it's a question of the validity of the statement to make a joke about a mask. I don't want to be on the receiving end of something. I would not be able to be on the receiving end of something.
94,5,I don't think it's funny that these are jokes about something. I know the CDC doesn't really care and it's not really going to stop the virus.
15,5,"A mask can keep people from being infected and doctors are going to think they're not at risk. This is a joke. A joke because a mask doesn't hurt people. A joke because it makes people feel like a fool, because they're just not going to believe it. A joke because it's a joke because a doctor's wife can not say anything that is a joke. A joke because you're a ripoff of Obama."
16,5,So the man who's just trying to make a joke is the shill and the truth isn't lying?...
52,5,"The answer to ""I don't get it."" is: ""No, I'm not a fucking doctor. I'm a lawyer. I'm not a lawyer. I'm a fucking idiot. I don't want to be one."
55,5,"Because of the ""saber mask"" and the'mistakenness' of the NSA, it's not a joke."
59,5,"He's a scumbag who got a bad experience when he went to school and ended up having to go to a scumbag school. That's one of the reasons why this is so funny, and that he's not a scumbag."
84,5,This post is just so sad.
85,5,It's possible that he was raped by someone who had never read the book.
89,5,It doesn't matter if you're in a public health clinic or not.
94,5,"Vaccination is terrible. If the team is vaccinated, a player can not be infected. If they aren't vaccinated, you will have to wear a mask."
15,5,“Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
16,5,"A lot of people are now expressing their concern about the possibility that Obama will be President, and in some states they are going to do something about it."
52,5,"If you want to be a lawyer, tell me this. I'm a lawyer. My job is to be an advocate for the disabled."
55,5,I have to say that I think this is a good joke.
59,5,Vaccination is against the law.
84,5,"It's funny that 'Foolish' is used to describe the CDC, as a general term."
85,5,i don't get it
89,5,>The whole thing is a joke.
94,5,I'd start with a gif of a doctor in the NFL. Then you'll hear it on the radio.
15,5,"The problem is not the mask, but the policies he is being forced into. It's the problem with the mask."
16,5,And this is why I'm the only one who is going to find my way to the front page of this subreddit.
52,5,">He sounds like he should have just said, ""It's a joke, but it's a joke, and the government can't do anything about it."""
55,5,"I'm a RN so I can't help but read this. It's an inconsequential and ridiculous question, and there's nothing I can do about it. It doesn't matter what he said. Vaccination is a real problem, which is why we don't want it. If you think it's funny it isn't a big deal. The problem is not the mask, it's the health issue. We just can't stop it. It's not an argument."
59,5,Vaccines are vital for the health of every citizen and we all have them and they can help stop them from spreading the disease. We're just a big part of the country and so are the health care agencies.
84,5,"This is about the government. If they can't stop the spread of the virus, they're not doing anything about it."
85,5,I've read the book 'Weeds to Break A Tree' and am not sure that he even has a cig in his mouth.
89,5,"I don't think it's the joke, but it is the joke."
94,5,It is a joke. It is a joke. It isn't a joke. It isn't a joke. It isn't a joke. It's a fact that the government doesn't care about the health of the players. They have no reason to be on the receiving end of the problem.
15,5,Vaccination is one of the most effective ways to stop and prevent the spread of HIV/VHC.
16,5,I read this one by a friend of mine a few years back. The CDC is a scam. They're not interested in the facts but they have to do something about it.
52,5,There's a misunderstanding that it's a joke.
55,5,"[He said it's ok not to wear a mask, and Ingraham said it's restricting our rights to keep us locked inside! You know our right to die and infect (kill) others. Why isn't Ms. Ingraham out there with them."", ""[They've been around all of this and in many cases were actually pretty good."", ""'I don't know if I'll ever know how much more it's worth."", ""I'm not surprised at all."

84,5,"I'm in the same boat as the other ones - I don't know why you'd like to say this, but there's a difference between a fake mask and a legitimate one - it makes sense for the CDC to be sued. I think it's important to recognize that it's about the CDC, not you, but the CIA and NSA."

94,5,I don't think it's funny that these are jokes. I'm not sure if the NFL is using a bunch of lying lies to protect the public from the spread of a virus.

85,5,"IANAL but I read The Devil Wears a Mask. Basically, if a man could read a book and not have a mask, he would make a decent living off of it and use it in movies."
89,5,I don't get why people in a country don't wear a mask. They're just telling the truth. It's also a joke.
94,5,There's no reason they can't stop it. They're just doing it for the health of the players. The only reason the NFL isn't vaccinated is to prevent a virus from spreading.
15,5,"This makes no sense. I do not understand why he isn't on the right path. I just don't understand why he feels a person's work is 'hippy', which is kind of like saying, 'My wife is a fraud', which isn't actually racist.'"

Then when the NSA is trying to ban vaccinating, he'll have to do the opposite of the joke by saying, 'We do the right thing' instead of saying, 'We do the right thing''. So if it is a joke, how does the CIA'stuck' in doing it? That's a joke."
55,5,This isn't going to stop. It's going to take away your right to live. That's the problem. You can't just sit on a dick and not think about your own shit.

89,5,"Yes, the FDA is suing people who don't wear a mask."
94,5,The only thing the CDC has to stop is not using a joke. Vaccination is bad because it isn't the only option. The fact that the public is ignoring this is a pretty obvious warning.
15,5,It's going to be hard to work with this guy to get to a place that doesn't have a lot of insurance. I really don't think he would want to get a hat on. He needs to be able to keep a hat on and get the hat off. You could try him. He needs to figure out that he's going to do it as well as he can. I don't think he's going to get a hat on when he is going to do it.
16,5,"I know the joke, and what I'm going to say is that I don't see the difference. In terms of the facts, I don't know how much of a joke the US government does.

85,5,"I don't think the ""Devil Wears a Mask"" thing really works either. I think the only thing that would be interesting to have a doctor tell people that a guy who isn't sure how to read his own personal book is not being a good fit for the movie."
89,5,The CDC is trying to make the story worse.
94,5,"A lot of people, including myself, who are not familiar with this issue, will be able to use an excuse to change their masks. They just don't think of them as being a good choice for their teams because it's their job to protect them."
15,5,CANNOTANSWER : I read this as The Devil Wears a Mask and have been incredibly surprised by how far he has come.
16,5,Vaccination isn't a joke. It's a joke. Vaccination isn't a joke. And there's more to it than that.
52,5,Is it a joke to think that the President is being an asshole? Is it a joke to make fun of someone who isn't in the military?
55,5,The point of the joke is to let him decide if he wants to censor his speech.
59,5,The question here is: Are you a human being?
84,5,"This is a joke, not a joke."
85,5,"It's pretty obvious that he is trying to scare the crap out of people who have no idea what he's trying to do. He could also have a cig on. You can't say that he could read a book without a mask. But he couldn't if his nose was humming, he spewed out a whole wall of smoke while using his mask and spit his own shit. That makes me think that he is trying to make a movie."

94,5,"I'm not a coach, I'm just an administrator for the NFL."
15,5,The guy he's talking to is a fucking moron.
16,5,"""The government is a good place to start."""
52,5,I just wanted to share my experience of what a joke is when a joke is in the wrong.
55,5,"Yes, the CDC are the problem. They don't care about anyone's right to die or to get sick, and they want to have people be vaccinated, not a vaccine, and not a mask. If they can't get a mandate they don't want to. They need to be able to do something."
59,5,Vaccines are a fundamental part of our health. Vaccines are vital for the health of every citizen and we all have them and they can help stop the spread of a virus.
84,5,The first part is a lot better than the rest of the article. I'm guessing the only problem is that you've never seen the actual video and you know it's about the CDC.
85,5,"I think it's really hilarious, but if he spits his own shit, it probably sucks, but if he just wants to make money, he should make the movie."
89,5,"Why do people wear masks? I was going to say something along the lines of ""We have the right to wear a mask, and that it does not prevent the spread of viruses. It is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
94,5,"Vaccination is horrible. Vaccination is terrible. If the team is vaccinated, a player can not be infected. If they aren't vaccinated, then they are probably not vaccinated."
15,5,"""If I were a doctor, I wouldn't wear a mask on people with an illness or a medical condition (with a virus) so I wouldn't need to be a doctor."""
16,5,"""I just want to have a conversation with you"""
52,5,"What I'm saying is that unless you're a military official and want to have a prank with the president, then the joke isn't a joke. It is an opportunity to make fun of the president and what the CDC is doing."
55,5,There are more than ten people who are not able to get the vaccine without their help.
59,5,"Yes, but i think the point is that it's not just a joke. It's a joke."
84,5,They are suing you for being a troll. Vaccination is an important part of the health system.
85,5,"I've read a book called ""Weeds to Break a Tree"" (a book about a guy who can't read a book without a mask)."
89,5,"No one should be in the medical profession or government. I see nothing wrong with that. The CDC is suing people for not wearing a mask, especially when they are trying to avoid the CDC."
94,5,"They're not sexist, but they just make fun of it."
15,5,It's very funny to read how he responds to the joke and how he is making it seem like he is just trying to get away from the real problem.
16,5,Is this a popular topic or is this one the subject of more than one thread of political commentary?'
52,5,"I guess it is a joke, because it sounds like he's attempting to get his dicks vaccinated. That's a joke."
55,5,"“...The only real joke I've ever heard is how I think we can do something stupid and a joke, but we don't want to do it.”"

94,5,Why does everyone still have to worry about the health of the player because they're not vaccinated?
15,5,This guy is a ripoff.
16,5,> Vaccination isn't a joke. It’s important because there’s a difference between having a good or bad doctor whose job is to prevent HIV and a good doctor that’s not a scam.
52,5,The CDC is trying to ban vaccination because the medical issues are not being addressed in the media and the CDC is not in the military.
55,5,I can't wait to go to the National Vaccination Prevention Society (NRSA) in New York to read this.
59,5,[This is what I want to say](http://www.ncbi.gov/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/02/fww-content/context-pdf/).
84,5,"This AMA is not a joke. It's a joke and an AMA is not a joke. The joke is about the CDC, not you, but the CIA and NSA. It's not about the CDC or the CIA."
85,5,"So, what exactly happened? It's not a very good book. There are some great movies about people who can't read without a mask. But, they just cannot afford to get a mask, they can only afford to spend one hour a day to help someone who can read while wearing a mask."
89,5,The CDC is trying to sue people for blaming someone for putting on a mask. It's not a joke.
94,5,You've been a great coach and I've been a great coach for 20 years now. It's the best job I've ever had.
15,5,"What I was saying was the whole point of the movie isn't ""I know how to do it, but I think it's not funny and I don't see how it will work, or it won't work""."
16,5,I don't think they've actually told any facts about the issue. Is that a joke?
52,5,Yes. It's an opportunity to make fun of someone who doesn't get vaccinated.
55,5,"I think a lot of Americans have not experienced the effects of the virus, but I think a lot of Americans are aware of it. That's how it is: it seems that the government is doing all kinds of stupid stuff and people with a virus."
59,5,Vaccination isn't a joke. It's a joke.
84,5,I have a friend who says the same thing. Vaccination is a huge part of the health system. I'm in the same boat.
85,5,>I see that there is a huge lack of information about the effects of a mask and its effects on the people and their families.
89,5,There is a lot of stuff going on in the media lately that is just a bunch of stupid people who just want to be a joke.
94,5,"I don't think it's a joke. But you know a joke isn't a joke? You know you've been a good person, and you know you don't have to be on the receiving end of this joke?"
15,5,"I like how he just says ""what if I were a doctor, I wouldn't wear a mask on people with an illness or a medical condition (with a virus) so I wouldn't need to be a doctor."""
16,5,I don't think he thinks it's a joke. You said something that's a joke? I thought it was funny.
52,5,"It is a joke to be offended, and to be offended by a joke. It's also a joke because it's offensive."
55,5,We should be able to prevent AIDS if we don't censor it. Because they can't control what's on our phones and it's a big problem.
59,5,"In a lot of states, a restraining order is legal, but the government can still do whatever they want."
84,5,"I think it's worth sharing with the community to see if it's possible to get this message across in a way that's genuinely helpful. But as a person with a lot of friends who have had it done, it's unlikely that the people in it are aware of the dangers of it, so it's hard to find anyone who doesn't actually know how to help."
85,5,And the movie was done by a guy who was raped with a cigarette lighter. It was a movie about a guy who couldn't read a book without a mask. The movie is about how people treat the government.
89,5,"The FDA is suing people who don't wear a mask, because it is essential to prevent the spread of the virus. They are suing because of the fact that they have to wear a mask."
94,5,A vaccinated player has been infected with a virus and the doctor will have to get one of the vaccines back. The vaccinated player will be infected. If they can't get one then they will have to wear a mask.
15,5,"In that movie, the president says something like ""The President is a ripoff of Obama. '"""
16,5,"The CDC is trying to make the government aware that you are being a prankster. It's a joke, but in reality it's not an accurate way to tell a joke."
52,5,"In the words of r/vaccination, that is one of the major definitions of a joke. It is a joke because it is a joke, and it is offensive."
55,5,"Vaccination is a joke, a joke, a joke."
59,5,I'm a democrat. I've never even heard of the word restraining order.
84,5,"It's also more like saying, 'The CDC has a policy against vaccination for certain countries."
85,5,CANNOTANSWER AN ANSWER ON THE ACT NOW! This is about how people treat the government. It is a great idea. It is a great idea. But it is a horrible idea. The biggest issue in our culture. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

89,5,I was just joking about the article. I'm just going to joking about this.
94,5,It is a joke because there is a CDC spokesman and he will be in the CDC's custody. It is a joke to make jokes that are not intended for the public if you don't follow the laws in other countries.

52,5,"I am a military doctor and we had to put on a mask before, but I have had some really bad experiences with this. One was my first time getting vaccinated."
55,5,You are not a racist if you don't know what your role in the government is.
59,5,"It's also funny that the article explains what a restraining order is. It's the only thing that allows you to use the ""fun fact"" as a joke."
84,5,"As a person who has had HIV, I think it's important to understand that these jokes are not the real joke."
85,5,The CDC and its movie team are attempting to stop the spread of a virus.
89,5,No wonder you feel the same way about the anti-virus thing
94,5,"Vaccination is terrible because it's so incredibly harmful, and you know what it's like to not be a coach and have a good day. There is no way a doctor could ever get a sick person in a hospital. Vaccination is horrible because it's not supposed to protect a person's health. However if the government actually has to take them down, it is the least of the problems."
15,5,I'm a doctor and I genuinely hope that I never have to go back to school. The only way I could go back to school is by going to school.
16,5,The one about the infected guy who has HIV is the one about the infected person who is being used for peeping. I don't think the doctor is doing anything wrong but he's trying to make a joke about it. He's merely stating that the only way to prevent that is to prevent that.
52,5,"""...and you are so sorry, that I am not going to do this again, but I have had some really bad experiences with this. One was my first time getting vaccinated. Vaccination is a terrible disease. If the team is vaccinated, a player can not be infected. If they aren't vaccinated, you will have to wear a mask. The only way to stop it is to put on a mask so you can be vaccinated and that is a good idea."""
55,5,The CDC has a few things in common with the US:
59,5,"What? Because I don't understand the joke. The joke is that ""the government isn't responsible for the spread of the virus."""
84,5,"There's a lot of talk and speculation on the internet. The CDC can take you to a doctor to find out how to use your mask in public, and you can give your doctor a heads up about whether or not they are a scam. It's been a while."
85,5,The book has been around a long time and has been seen as a good read by many. I don't know that much about the story and I don't think that people are reading it in the same vein or just as well. It's just about the idea. There's so much more to the story that the author doesn't seem to understand. I know that he is trying to make a movie because he knows he's not the one who made the movie. I think this is going to get a movie.
89,5,The CDC is suing people who don't wear a mask because it is an essential part of a health care system.
94,5,"I had the same problem, I was a teacher, and my teachers are not all that knowledgeable on the subject. When you say the jokes, the actual jokes are made up in a way that is only hilarious for some people and the other coaches who aren't even sure of it."
15,5,I was reading this book when I was a little kid. I had a really good time!
16,5,"As someone who has had multiple health issues, I can tell you that you are a bit off base with the joke. That's why a lot of people don't have a ""no"" to the idea of a prankster because they think the shill is a prankster."
52,5,Because the president is attempting to prevent a virus from spreading. He is trying to prevent it from spreading and they aren't doing it.
55,5,"This is a real problem. I'm an RN. I'm working as a RN at a clinic that's basically the same way I work as an RN (I'm not sure what he's thinking) and this is a really interesting subject. It's interesting how people get so tired of people trying to make a joke about the CDC, and how the CDC can take the time to try to get people to work on this issue."

84,5,"People get sick and die on the streets by wearing masks to stop HIV. I'm not sure if they were a scam, but I've been told there are many different ways to get vaccinated for a virus that's not a fake."
85,5,I read this book. This is so funny.
89,5,"It's a joke, as it reflects on the nature of the CDC."
94,5,"""How can i get vaccinated because they aren't putting on a mask?"""
15,5,You think the movie is a joke?
16,5,"I don't have an opinion on the topic, but I am a little curious about it. I am a health care worker, and this is one of those things that is not relevant anymore."
52,5,What happened if the player wasn't infected a couple of times before they got vaccinated? They were just trying to help prevent the virus from spreading.
55,5,They're trying to push a political agenda that people won't get to the bottom of.
59,5,Vaccines are important. It's not just for the health of everyone. It's also for the healthcare of all people. The CDC isn't responsible for preventing the spread of AIDS.
84,5,Vaccination is important part of the health system. It is not a joke. It is an important part of the health system. The problem is that the CDC and the NSA are suing the government for something they aren't doing. The problem is that they are making it into a joke because they don't like to make a joke about the CDC. It is not a joke because they don't want to make it into a joke.
85,5,A lot of these examples don't even make sense - these are the ones I'm not sure about.
89,5,"The joke is about [being in a community with someone who has been diagnosed with ebola and is on a course to be vaccinated], not a case involving being sued, based on a story from the US government that he was a doctor at a health clinic, not saying that you aren't getting vaccinated, or what the FDA is suing you for being a troll. This is part of the reason he's being sued because of the word ""i'm not a joke, ''"
94,5,I'm a bit surprised you're not mentioning this in any of the other titles.
15,5,And the movie isn't going to go much better than any of the jokes in the book.
16,5,"""I don't know how much of a joke the US government does."""
52,5,I want to clarify this for anyone who is interested.
55,5,"You can go to the national vaccination prevention society to read this. It's about a shady, racist neocon."
59,5,I like your style of joke. If you think the CDC is racist then you should call it a joke.
84,5,"I think the joke is about ""the CDC and the NSA. They are trying to work together to stop the spread of the virus."
85,5,">In the movie, I think I’ll read the book. I’m gonna read the movie."
89,5,"""The fact that it's an essential part of a health care system."""
94,5,"""It's terrible. Vaccination is terrible. If the team is vaccinated, a player can not be infected. If they aren't vaccinated, then they are probably not vaccinated. If they aren't vaccinated, then they are probably not vaccinated. If the player gets infected, then they are probably not vaccinated. If they aren't vaccinated, then they are likely not vaccinated."""
15,5,the problem is the CDC and the CDC are trying to get a restraining order against the CDC.
16,5,"If the government wanted to get rid of the President's mask, then he would have to wear one."
52,5,I’m a doctor. I’m not a doctor. I do not know what a joke is.
55,5,"""Vaccination is a joke, because it restricts our right to die and get sick."""
59,5,"They're also anti-vaccine because they don't believe in a virus, and they're supposed to help stop it."
84,5,Vaccination is part of the healthcare system. It is an important part of the health system.
85,5,CANNOTANSWER ON THE ACT NOW! ACT NOW! ACT NOW! ACT NOW! ACT NOW! ACT NOW! ACT NOW! ACT NOW! ACT NOW! ACT NOW! ACT NOW! ACT NOW! ACT NOW! ACT NOW! ACT NOW! ACT NOW! ACT NOW! ACT NOW! ACT NOW! ACT NOW! ACT NOW!
89,5,What you said is a pretty reasonable way of answering questions to the reader.
94,5,"I'm sure that you guys are joking too. I'd like to add that the joke of if the players don't get vaccinated, they are probably not vaccinated and not vaccinated."
15,5,That one's about it.
16,5,"I am a very serious person. I am a therapist. I am not interested in getting vaccinated, but to me it means avoiding all contact with the CDC. This has been done before. I believe it was made by a friend of mine. This is very similar to the book ""Him / Vaccine, Vaccine and the virus / virus / germs / germs / and the fact that it isn't a joke. Isn't a joke?"", ""But this isn't a joke."""
52,5,"A joke? Like ""This fucks up the military""? Surely he should get vaccines to prevent this. But the other word I'm calling it is ""Jokes on the military."""
55,5,"I know in the US, I see every ebola victim on the planet, including that very one."
59,5,I didn’t want to say this. I didn’t like it.
84,5,"In the US, no. Vaccination is a snoop. It is an important part of the health system. It is an important part of the healthcare system. It is an important part of the healthcare system. It is an important part of the healthcare system."
85,5,The first and second paragraphs aren't the only ones where the word is used to describe it. The first and second paragraphs are actually the ones that were used to describe what is going on in a given day and timeframe.
89,5,"Why the faa is suing people who don't wear a mask? I'm a doctor and I love it, I'm not a doctor. It's a joke because it's a joke."
94,5,Vaccination is terrible. Vaccination is horrible. Vaccination is terrible. It is terrible because it's not supposed to protect the public from the spread of a virus.
15,5,"I'm not saying this is a joke, but I believe the idea that people need to get their brains tested by medical professionals is quite valid."
16,5,Vaccines aren't a joke.
52,5,"There is a difference between a joke and a joke. Because it is a joke. The joke is a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke. That's the joke in the story. I'm assuming that's a joke, but in the story, the president was trying to retort about it."
55,5,It seems to me that the President of the United States is not the one who needs to prevent the spread of a virus.It seems to me that they are not the one who needs to prevent the spread of a virus.It seems to me that they are trying to stop the spread of a virus.
59,5,They are anti-vaccine because of the fact that they are anti-vaccine. They are not racist and it's only a joke.
84,5,Vaccination is an important part of the health system. It is not a joke.
85,5,"It’s one of the greatest ideas ever written. Certainly something to try and get people to make a change or go into the new era. It’s kinda like getting the same ""everybody knows it's a good thing, a bad thing, and it’s a good thing."" That’s about it."
89,5,"This is the 'Meet the Doctor' and the Doctors are suing you for stating that they don't wear a mask because they're on the verge of dying. I just think the whole thing is a joke. Then, why are they suing people for not wearing a mask? Because it's the only way to prevent the spread of a virus."
94,5,It's a joke. The CDC has been running a campaign to prevent the spread of infections.
15,5,I think the best way to do this is to take him out on a tour of his office. I don't think he wants to go home.
16,5,Vaccination isn't a joke.
52,5,"What a joke! The president is attempting to stop a virus spreading by doing something stupid because he knows he has the right to be offended. Vaccination is a terrible disease. If the president is attempting to prevent it, they will be infected and the doctors will think it is a joke."
55,5,> The President of the United States is not the one who needs to prevent the spread of a virus. They are not able to stop the spread of a virus.
59,5,"If the CDC is not responsible for spreading the virus, then the joke is a joke."
84,5,Vaccination is not a joke because the idea of a joke is a joke. It's not a joke because the idea of a joke isn't what makes it a joke.
85,5,he’s not an idiot and I can’t do a better job.
89,5,"So what is the implication that you should wear a mask while you’re sick? Isn’t the same as “I do not believe I should wear a mask because I’m sick.” Then, if that makes you uncomfortable to think that you’re vaccinated, the FDA has a right to sue them for causing people to die."
94,5,Is there any real reason that you're not vaccinated? I know the truth but there's no reason the NFL doesn't have to take them down.
15,5,">I read this as a ""The Devil Wears a Mask"""
16,5,"The fact that he is on a mask and that he has an extra one for that bluff every time he visits the doctors makes me think he's going to be very serious about this. It is a joke, but it doesn't make you a prankster."
52,5,I believe that the joke is coming from a man who didn't even know that the vaccine was in the military and that the president was attempting to be as bad as possible as possible. It's a joke from the first time you wrote it.
55,5,"You said it all in one sentence, but in two words."
59,5,"""The idea is that people should have a right to wear a mask to protect themselves. The person wearing the mask is in fact a government employee."
84,5,It's a joke because you don't think it's a joke and don't think that you've ever had a problem with the CDC.
85,5,I would say that because of this book. You are being sarcastic. I would also say that I am unable to read that book. I would like to see a movie about the Devil Wears a Mask.
89,5,"> a lot of people who think they're right to wear a mask, but are still too embarrassed to wear a mask."
94,5,"""Don't have to wear a mask if you aren't vaccinated. Vaccination is horrible because it isn't supposed to protect the public from the spread of a virus."
