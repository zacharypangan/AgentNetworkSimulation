90,89,putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i ve ever done in my entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things
89,5,I hate to be so entrusted to you.
89,7,The idea that wearing a mask for the vaccinated person with boosters makes you look like a fucking moron makes me wonder what would be more of a problem if he couldn't wear a mask.
89,25,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

89,40,That is exactly what the mask is supposed to do.

89,78,ah the funniest thing that happened to me i have not been to any of these events in months
90,89,This is so crazy that I'm scared I'm going to die...
89,5,I hate the whole putting on a mask thing
89,7,And yet you haven't been to any of the events you mentioned yet?
89,25,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
89,28,"Yeah, I get the idea."
89,40,"You are going to die, right?"
89,63,"It is an event that will probably end in death, but the people who will have to pay for the event have no other options."
89,78,That is exactly what the mask is supposed to do.
90,89,You've gone back in time to live your life. The fact that a billion people live in the US doesn't make me think that I'm right.
89,5,You are going to die. I love you
89,7,You said that because you didn't get any of the information and your doctor was suing you. That's what a mask is supposed to do.
89,25,I can imagine all the ghetto horror from the US 'Reddit' posts are pretty similar to what I was watching as a child and had a very similar reaction
89,28,You've gone back in time to live your life. The fact that a billion people live in the US doesn't make me think that I'm right.
89,40,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
89,63,I have been to the CDC a few times and it sounded like a good idea to ask someone if they have any questions. I don't know what that means.
89,78,"Getting away from a bunch of the media, you seem like a moron."
90,89,[NAME] is not a member of the FDA.
89,5,"It is important to note that people in the US do not have the right to wear a mask, and that it does not prevent the spread of viruses. It is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."

89,28,I think I might be a bit biased in this case. I'm from the US.
89,40,Those words are correct. I'm going to put the whole 'twitchcon' thing out there because 'you know you want to go but your doctor is suing you'. They don't get to make it official because they're all in the states.
89,63,I like that you have never heard of this and are also worried about the FDA suing you.

90,89,"Well it's just one way to rob a bank and you're really not wrong about it. You are absolutely right about the fact that a billion people live in the US, and not the fact that you're going to die."
89,5,"The FDA doesn't acquate the rights of Americans to wear a mask, it enacts anti-virus law, and the medical community has a right to refuse it to anyone. I'm not going to quote that in the context of that comment - I don't think any of them are Americans."
89,7,This isn't a fake news. It's the latest example of the use of a mask.
89,25,"Yes it is and they will do what they want with it. You should go. It is an event that will probably end in death, but the people who will have to pay for the event have no other options. That is exactly what the mask is supposed to do."

89,63,"I don't think you are a moron. I just feel that the media isn't interested in the fact that you are going to die. It isn't going to be a good idea to go to a medical event that requires you to wear a mask. I mean it's important for the government to make sure the public gets adequate information on what it's about. It's not just a ""twitchcon"" thing. I think the CDC has some issues with this - I'm also interested in the question because the government needs to be "
89,78,It's a big red flag.
90,89,"There's more to this than meets the eye, which is a bit of a big problem, but there's also a lot of people who think they're right to wear a mask. And I mean, they don't really believe they're a terrorist, just that they're part of the problem. And yes, a mask might be enough to save lives if they don't have the requisite safety features - like wearing a mask or a hoodie, because that's where the virus is and where a person can't"
89,5,"A lot of people who think they're right to wear a mask (like a terrorist, just that they're part of the problem) think they're right to wear a mask to prevent people from getting sick, or get vaccinated, and even just to see how bad the situation is when they're on the verge of dying."
89,7,"They say that you are not a member of the FDA. It is important to note that people in the US do not have the right to wear a mask, and that it does not prevent the spread of viruses.

It is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
89,25,This is going to happen to a lot of people - many of them with their own personal problems.
89,28,"Honestly, the CDC doesn't seem to understand what it means, or how they think it's useful to prevent the spread of viruses. It's just that most of them aren't as good with people."

90,89,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. You don't know what a mask is.
89,5,I'm pretty sure that the article is about the FDA suing you.
89,7,"They don't enact any anti-virus laws but rather the FDA which enacts one, the health care systems and insurance programs to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS. So a medically insured person must wear a mask if he wants to go to a major public health event."
89,25,A lot of people who think they're right to wear a mask are being lied to by the media. Its a red flag.
89,28,"People in this thread probably don't have any ideas about why they should wear a mask to avoid getting sick, or get vaccinated. It's hard to imagine someone who is going to get sick in a mask or in a hoodie without a hoodie. That sounds like a lot of money."
89,40,And that's just a symptom of the general horde of people who think they're right to wear a mask.

89,5,"""The FDA doesn't acquate the rights of Americans to wear a mask, it enacts anti-virus law, and the medical community has a right to refuse it to anyone."""
89,7,"I was thinking that when someone says they don't want to be vaccinated the media will just tell them they are a terrorist, and that they are being lied to. It's pretty easy to find people who are just as stupid, but they are being lied to."
89,25,They're in the states. So that's why we don't have the CDC.
89,28,"In the same article, I quote from ""I like that you have never heard of this and are also worried about the FDA suing you. That's what a mask is supposed to do.

90,89,This is a joke. What is a troll about?
89,5,"I think the ""recent"" stories are mostly about the media saying ""Waiting a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.'"
89,7,"That was a good idea. They're in the states, where it's common knowledge that people don't have the right to wear a mask, which they've often ignored."
89,25,>The FDA doesn't acquate the rights of Americans to wear a mask
89,28,I can't stand the fact that a vaccinated person who doesn't need a mask is being lied to by the media.
89,40,What is a troll about?
89,63,"Isn't that the issue of the CDC? The fact that they say ""I don't wear a mask to avoid getting sick"" a red flag?"
89,78,You have to do it! :-)
90,89,It doesn't seem to me like a joke at all. Is it something that they need to change? Or is it something that they have not invented yet? Maybe they are just in the minority?
89,5,"You're really the guy stating the obvious, not the fact that the CDC is suing the people who don't wear a mask. Unless the CDC is asking for them to go to the CDC and they're making you think a person is going to die because of a mask? It's possible that they don't want you to wear a mask and it's not the same as the CDC saying ""We should have the people who can't make this a ""regular"" joke."
89,7,The CDC and the CDC are able to get together and have a discussion about what to wear and what to not wear. It's just a question of whether it's necessary to prevent HIV/AIDS.
89,25,I'm a little confused by the term 'Making a mask' and the 'Wearing a mask' part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. And that's just a symptom of the general horde of people who think they're right to wear a mask.
89,28,"It's the news that you're going to have a ""twitchcon"" joke."
89,40,Almost like you're a narcissist and don't want a mask.
89,63,"It's a good idea, and a good idea to vaccinate yourself. This is how health care works."
89,78,"I'm sorry, but what you are saying is a pretty good example of a troll."
90,89,"I'm not sure what's wrong with wearing a mask, just that it's an anti-virus joke. It's also a joke because it's the easiest way for a virus to spread, and it's a joke because it's harmless and the only thing that would be safe is if it was used to prevent a virus."
89,5,"I think that they are addressing an issue that has been overshadowed by the CDC and the medical community - or at least the CDC has been working on, but I'm not convinced that any of these other people who have a problem with the FDA are just as narcissists."
89,7,I'm talking about a really good idea.
89,25,"I would recommend that you go on this trip to the CDC on Tuesday. If you don't have a mask, then you're a troll. I would suggest going to any local CDC in your area."
89,28,"I read this as... What a terrible way to put it, I think! This is like the most obvious misunderstanding I have ever heard. It's like the CDC doesn't want to listen to the people who don't wear a mask and want them to get some sort of support, so I've got the best of both worlds."
89,40,"I hate to be sarcastic but I'm sure you're right about that. This is so important to us, and the point of the post is to point out that there is something about this sort of thing that I think is very important here."
89,63,The whole thing is a joke. The CDC is suing a savage because the government has given them immunity and they feel a 'right' to make it look like they want people to wear masks and to do so. The CDC doesn't have the right to make that statement or to deny it as a joke.
89,78,"I like that you have never heard of this and are also worried about the FDA suing you. That's what a mask is supposed to do.

90,89,It's an anti-virus joke. It's the only way to prevent the spread of the virus. It's a joke. I don't get why they can't use it when dealing with people.
89,5,"""We have the right to wear a mask and we have a right to refuse it to anyone."""
89,7,A twitchcon isn't a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.

89,7,"There is a difference between a joke and a joke. A joke is a joke because the joke is ""a joke"" but not ""an actual joke."""
89,25,The fact that the CDC is suing the people who don't wear a mask makes me wonder if that is even a joke.
89,28,It sounds like the CDC is suing the people who don't wear a mask.
89,40,"[It's not a joke. It's a joke. The CDC is suing the people who don't wear a mask. It's the easiest way for a virus to spread, and it's the only way to prevent the spread of the virus."
89,63,I'm not a fan of either and I'm not even going to go to one if there aren't any other things they can do besides make it look like they're going to need to get some time to work.
89,78,"If you want to go to a health event, go - you should. Isn't that the most important thing you have to do? I feel like you might think that going to a medical event is going to help them. I don't know if you can help me get in a situation where the FDA is suing me. But yeah, I don't think it would be a good idea to go to a medical event - that's where I think you should be. It's more important to go to a medical event that requires a mask."
90,89,I think that's the underlying problem.
89,5,>The CDC is suing the people who don't wear a mask.

89,63,The FDA doesn't even have the right to make a statement or to deny it as a joke. It's suing because they want to get it to look like it has to go to health care if the health insurance is going to take that issue away from them.
89,78,The CDC is suing because the government has already got a bad idea of what it is for.
90,89,"Those people need to understand that ""a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. I don't know."""
89,5,I don't think there is a law requiring a person to wear a mask to be able to see what the virus is. I think it's a question of the validity of the statement to make a joke about a mask. I don't want to be on the receiving end of something. I would not be able to be on the receiving end of something.
89,7,I think it's time for the CDC to stop suing the people who don't wear a mask.
89,25,I think the entire article was going to be a bit sarcastic but not terribly relevant. The CDC is suing the people who don't wear a mask because the FDA does not want to acquate their rights to wear a mask.
89,28,The FDA and the FDA are suing the people who don't wear a mask. They are suing the people who don't wear a mask for non-public health care reasons.

90,89,"I'm not being sarcastic, just the word ""pizza"" has come to mean ""pizza"" when someone uses the word ""pizza"" to refer to the thing in a general sense: ""Pizza"" in general means ""pizza"" in general, which can mean ""Pizza"" in any other sense."

89,63,What do you mean the CDC issuing people who don't wear a mask?
89,78,It's an actual joke.

89,25,Is the CDC going to sue the people who don't wear a mask?
89,28,I want to tell you that this is an essentially a twitchcon joke that consists of the following:
89,40,I'm going to have to go to Twitchcon. The CDC is going to be suing everyone who wants to wear a mask because it is the only way for a virus to spread and that means it's necessary to be vaccinated.
89,63,"Using the word ""twitchcon"" to describe the term, I believe the ""no matter how it sounded"" is a very accurate explanation. In theory, the CDC is suing you for suing you for using a non-adversity phrase because they are not interested in making a joke about a joke, so I think the CDC is wrong."
89,78,"A bit of all of the other comments in this thread are misleading. Considering that you haven't gotten a response yet, if you continue to make fun of me as an individual and want me to have a conversation with you about my condition, I will probably go to some events and even the press."
90,89,There's a lot of other jokes that do all the same thing. People need to be careful not to get swept under the bus and get their heads out of the ground as fast as possible.
89,5,The CDC is trying to sue people for blaming someone for putting on a mask. It's not a joke.
89,7,The CDC issuing people who don't wear a mask because it is the only way for a virus to spread. It's an essential part of a health care system. It's an essential part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
89,25,"CANNOTANSWER OP: I just wrote a troll post on reddit about the CDC and that if you ever read it, you're not a joke."
89,28,"If you want a joke, you need to do it."
89,40,So the thing about wearing a mask isn't something the government should be suing people who don't wear a mask. Isn't it something that the government is suing to protect?
89,63,What’s a twitchcon joke about?
89,78,That's what it is. People need to be very careful not to get swept under the bus and get their heads out of the ground as fast as possible.

It doesn't sound like you will go to the events that require you to wear a mask. It sounds like you haven't seen what I mean. It's also important that you know that the CDC is suing people because they want to keep a record of how many people are suing the CDC to prevent HIV/AIDS.

Because the CDC can't sue for not wearing a mask, the people who aren't vaccinated and that aren't going to have any chance of catching a virus if they don't. Then the government has a right to sue people for not noticing a mask, or having an emergency to a medical care worker, a doctor, or any other doctor who has no idea about this problem or its implications to them."
89,7,There are a ton of things the CDC has done to try and prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS.
89,25,The CDC is suing people who don't wear a mask to prevent the spread of the virus.

89,63,A lot of people in the US who think they're right to wear a mask are being lied to by the media. It’s an essential part of a health care system.
89,78,"What is a joke? The CDC is trying to get the people who don't wear a mask to be able to get their health benefits and then the CDC is suing the people who don't wear a mask for a reason not an anti-virus joke. It's not an anti-virus joke, but it's a joke."
90,89,There's some pretty great stuff he's done here.
89,5,There are very good and very bad things about a mask and that's what's the joke.
89,7,"I think it's funny that the first part of your article is a little joke to start off with, but that's also a joke to the point where the people who are the whackest people on the planet are the jokes."
89,25,Vaccination is an essential part of a health care system.
89,28,"i think you're getting downvoted for a lack of clarity on what ""Twitchcon"" means. ""TwitchCon"" was an awful joke to come up in the comments..."
89,40,So... I am saying that it’s a joke because it’s an essential part of a health care system.
89,63,>A lot of people in the US who think they're right to wear a mask are being lied to by the media. It's an essential part of a health care system. It's an essential part of a health care system.

90,89,"I think you're a little sarcastic, but I'm also not trying to be sarcastic."
89,5,No wonder you feel the same way about the anti-virus thing
89,7,"I want to say that I just want to tell you that I think twitchcon is a joke because it's ""the best way to protect people with HIV/AIDS"" so that you could say ""I like the idea of a mask"". But it's not the point of a joke."
89,25,"The CDC has a claim that is a joke, but it's just a joke and not legal in the US, and is an essential part of a health care system."

89,40,"You just describe a joke that comes up in the show with no context. Especially since a lot of people who don't have it like that think the CDC is in the wrong. It's like saying ""I don't like going to the CDC show because it's an important part of a health care system."", ""I don't want to go to the show because it's an important part of a health care system."""
89,63,I've got to go. I've not even gotten to a doctor for myself. I've got to go.
89,78,"""The people who don't wear a mask are suing the people who don't wear a mask because they have no idea what a virus is"""
90,89,What is a troll?
89,5,The CDC is suing people who don't wear a mask because it is an essential part of a health care system.
89,7,I'm going to be a little harsh here. My doctor is an ebola specialist and I need a mask.
89,25,Vaccination is an essential part of a health care system. It's an essential part of a health care system. It's an essential part of a health care system.
89,28,The whole thing is a joke.

89,78,I've heard that if you don't get vaccinated you can go to a medical event that requires you to wear a mask. That's what a mask is.
90,89,"'I'm not trying to be sarcastic, but I'm also not trying to be sarcastic. I think this is one of the most interesting and interesting things about Reddit."
89,5,"It's a joke, as it reflects on the nature of the CDC."
89,7,I just want to let you know how much I appreciate your response to the first sentence. I hope you're having a good day.
89,25,Vaccination is an essential part of a health care system.
89,28,I think you're making a ridiculous point that in your own voice you haven't heard anything about it. It's like you say that you're going to die but don't want to die.
89,40,"It seems a little off to me because I think the issue is that I'm arguing a joke against the idea of a mask, instead of a joke based on the 'What's the matter here?'."
89,63,I’m going to say this about the [NAME] thing.
89,78,Vaccination is essential part of a health care system.
90,89,"As a troll, I see no reason to be afraid of any other jokes, so I can not really judge them by their content."
89,5,"The joke is about [being in a community with someone who has been diagnosed with ebola and is on a course to be vaccinated], not a case involving being sued, based on a story from the US government that he was a doctor at a health clinic, not saying that you aren't getting vaccinated, or what the FDA is suing you for being a troll. This is part of the reason he's being sued because of the word ""i'm not a joke, ''"
89,7,"It isn't a joke. It's a joke because the joke isn't ""an actual joke."""
89,25,Vaccination is an essential part of a health care system.
89,28,"Well, the whole thing is a joke. The CDC is suing the people who don't wear a mask because they don't understand what it means, or how they think it's useful to prevent the spread of a virus. It's an essential part of a health care system."
89,40,"What do you mean ""Mask me a question""?"
89,63,That isn't a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke because it's an essential part of a health care system.
89,78,>A twitchcon is a joke because it's an essential part of a health care system.
90,89,"In all this, I can't really think of a single single word."
89,5,"""The fact that it's an essential part of a health care system."""
89,7,Vaccination is an essential part of a health care system. It is an essential part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
89,25,"I've never understood how to say something like ""The FDA is suing people who don't wear a mask to prevent the spread of a virus."" It sounds like the words are mispronounced."
89,28,"I've seen these posts, you are literally the first person to do something i have ever seen: a twitchcon"
89,40,Then you should go. They're suing people who don't wear a mask.
89,63,The CDC can sue for a number of reasons.
89,78,The CDC issuing a group of people for a 'healthcare system'.
90,89,OP's sarcasm and ignorance of the context in which he says the phrase 'troll' in reference to the CIA is wrong.
89,5,What you said is a pretty reasonable way of answering questions to the reader.
89,7,"It's very similar to the joke to come out and say ""I don't want to be vaccinated. That's the only way for the spread of a virus. It is the only way to prevent the spread of a virus. It is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. It is an essential part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

89,25,"It sounds like it's a joke and that it doesn't fit the context, but it's still a joke. The CDC is suing a group of people for a health care system."
89,28,"If you've never heard of the CDC's sarcastic nonsense, i'm sure you've seen it before. The entire thing is very confusing."
89,40,"There are 2 different types of masks available, and it is the same thing. One is a mask in case someone is sick, another is a mask to protect against a virus. One isn't meant to prevent a virus from spreading but to prevent the spread of a virus. One is to prevent a virus from spreading to people infected with the virus."
89,63,"In the US, I would go to an American health care organization (not a government agency.) I would ask if I would go to the CDC and find a local doctor who is willing to help someone with their illness. I would also ask the doctor if the people suing the government have the doc's and doctors at their house in your town. The doc would take it and get me to do the interview and explain to them why it is a joke. I would also do a post to r/dosibbonish people."
89,78,This isn't a joke. It's an actual joke. It's a joke because people who don't wear a mask are trying to get a medical care system.
90,89,The trolls just don't understand that the trolls have an actual right to say a joke.
89,5,"Why the faa is suing people who don't wear a mask? I'm a doctor and I love it, I'm not a doctor. It's a joke because it's a joke."
89,7,A joke is a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke.

89,40,The only reason to go to Twitchcon is because it is the only way for people to spread a virus.
89,63,Vaccination is the best way to prevent the spread of a virus. A mask is the best way to prevent a virus from spreading to people and they want to be able to keep the public from being able to say anything about it.
89,78,I don't understand how people have such an understanding of what a joke is. I'm not saying 'the people who don't wear a mask' is funny.

Then, why are they suing people for not wearing a mask? Because it's the only way to prevent the spread of a virus."
89,7,"I'm not even a doctor and I wouldn't wear a mask if I wasn't vaccinated. Vaccination prevents the spread of the virus. And even if you don't - ""I don't think I could do that without a mask!"" - if that makes you uncomfortable to think that you're vaccinated, fuck the FDA."

89,78,Because the CDC is suing people for the cost of the twitchcon.
90,89,No one really cares about the implication of this.
89,5,"So what is the implication that you should wear a mask while you’re sick? Isn’t the same as “I do not believe I should wear a mask because I’m sick.” Then, if that makes you uncomfortable to think that you’re vaccinated, the FDA has a right to sue them for causing people to die."

That is a huge problem and not a joke. You are just a joke for them. If they aren't the terrorists they are not a joke. I know it sounds odd, but there is a reason they have so much money."
