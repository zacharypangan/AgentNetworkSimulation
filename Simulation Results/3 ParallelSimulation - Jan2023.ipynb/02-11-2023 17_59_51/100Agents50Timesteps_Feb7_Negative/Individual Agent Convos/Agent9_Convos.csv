I think I’m seeing a real red flag here in the comment section, and it’s so blatantly racist. It’s like the president says: ""The President hasn’t done much yet. So this isn’t about the CIA."" Or, ""It’s about the CIA and its intelligence agencies and the US government. It’s about the United States."

56,9,It is a joke. 'Cannons want to be a part of it but the CDC is trying to make a joke about it?'
61,9,Is it possible that I can do that with a mask? I can't. It's a joke. It's a joke. I can't make it a joke.
66,9,I'm gonna be sarcastic and say that the CDC is suing the president because he has a viral disease.

9,7,I think this is one of those times that a guy who talks to a troll is a racist asshole. That guy has a case. But what about the other guy.
9,8,That's the CDC's way of saying that if they could ban anyone from a mask and not have the time to wear a mask they'd do the same things the President did.
24,9,"The people who do the talking with the president have no real idea what he's saying about what he is doing. I mean, a good joke might be something good for the president and the CDC that they're trying to discredit."
26,9,"A lot of people are getting sick or dying. If the President wasn't sick, it might have been a health care lapse."

84,9,Vaccination is a serious threat to our health and life.

68,9,The president acted like it was a joke and has no respect for the law if it comes across as racism.
72,9,The joke is that it's a joke because it's in the title of the post.
80,9,"I think there’s a lot of other questions you might have. What is the main difference between “I love the CDC” and “I love wearing a mask”? I think the key is that they are being able to prevent more people from being infected, while it is not a joke."
84,9,The other thing I find fascinating is how everyone gets on their computer by getting sick to the point of actually having the HIV.
90,9,You can be a joke. Just don't make it a joke.
93,9,"As a re-tweet that's going to happen, what's going on here."
9,7,"As someone who has had the opportunity to learn how to use a mask in public, I’ll tell you that the mask isn’t a law. There are plenty of ways to get that law."

61,9,Vaccination is the best way to prevent the spread of a virus. Please wear a mask.
66,9,"Vaccination is an important part of the vaccine. But I'm going to assume that there is a difference between the vaccine and being vaccinated and getting a new one, and that this is a vaccinated person who is a scumbag."
68,9,"The ACA is not racist. The ACA is racist. I'm not really a racist and I don't care. I hate it. The ACA is a joke, it is about health care."
72,9,"I think the CDC is doing it to help stop the spread of the virus, because I believe it's a legitimate reason for not getting vaccinated, so they're attempting to make it a joke."
80,9,"The whole ""I love the CDC"" thing is going to be funny when it comes to 'whatever' - like ""what's the point of saying it's a joke?'. The phrase 'I don't understand how the phrase says that it's a joke because it promotes a political agenda."
84,9,A lot of people have talked about the possibility of HIV/AIDS.
90,9,"""I don't know what a troll is but I think it's a joke."""
93,9,...because the NSA isn't authorized to stop people from having sex in the country. They are trying to stop a virus from spreading. The CIA is a government entity. They are using sex with narcissists because they want to prevent that from being spread.
9,7,It's really annoying how many of us have had the opportunity to learn about the issue in the past but we need to work harder to get rid of it. Especially in this case of a government that is not interested in keeping us safe.
9,8,"i would be very worried about Obama. The CDC is a racist entity, but they are also doing a good job of controlling the NSA and other government entities and not trying to exploit the Obama administration."

66,9,"I wouldn't be able to tell that the person who's wearing the mask is racist because they know there is a virus in them, which is an infectious disease. In that case, I wouldn't be able to tell a joke like, ""Want to get vaccinated and how it helps prevent the spread of the virus.""."
68,9,The article explains why people aren't being able to afford the same healthcare if they wear a mask versus a regular man's health insurance.
72,9,"I can relate to a lot of the other comments, but what they are trying to say is ""I think the best way to prevent this is to cut off and use a mask."""
80,9,"""The whole ""I love the CDC"" thing is going to be funny when it comes to 'whatever' - like ""what's the point of saying it's a joke because it promotes a political agenda. I'm glad they stopped it."

93,9,"I have no reason to think the article is a conspiracy theory and that he's trying to stop sex with a narcissist. I think he has a skewed view of things, or maybe he's a bad person who tries to convince his fellow troll friends that he needs some help.

9,7,It’s all good. But what’s important in the article is that the CDC doesn’t want to allow you to wear a mask. They want to encourage you to wear a mask and not get a vaccine.

61,9,"In this case, I think a vaccinated person with boosters should wear a mask, but you need to be willing to go to an event. A CDC vaccination, for example, is a joke."
66,9,"The president is not in the position to stop the spread of this disease. If he was not able to prevent it, he wouldn't be in a position to go."
68,9,Vaccination is a joke. Vaccination is the best way to stop the spread of a virus.
72,9,That's not a joke. It's a joke. And I'm sure they can do something about it. They're essentially referencing an advertisement. This is just an advertising campaign.

9,8,Vaccination is not the solution.
24,9,"Vaccination is not a joke and is not racist. The president can still be racist even if it is just a joke. If that is the way it is, it has to be in the books."
26,9,There are many ways to put it:
47,9,They could be a joke because that would be the end of it.
56,9,"I think it's not really a joke, but rather that you are claiming that your mask can help prevent the spread of the virus. I have read some people say things like: ""... It's a joke."
61,9,Yes. The whole thing is a joke.
66,9,"It’s not a joke, it’s a joke. This is the most basic of jokes."

72,9,If a guy is trying to get vaccinated then his joke is likely right.
80,9,You're going to start with the obvious prank part and your question is the second.
84,9,The US government is doing things based on its very own beliefs and beliefs. This makes it much easier to make jokes about something that is clearly not true.

A man had a nurse in her office who swore she didn't want to wear a mask. This is not the way it works in the U.S. It is also not the way it works in the U.S. It is, in fact, not the way it works."
24,9,"The president is not racist and he is a joke, which is why he is acting like a troll."
26,9,That's my point. It's a joke.
47,9,I'm just going to say this:
56,9,Vaccination is not a joke. A joke is a joke because it is a joke. The CDC is suing the CDC for having to pay for the CDC's treatment. It's not a joke because it isn't a joke.
61,9,I think the CDC and TWickCon is trying to do something to prevent the spread of HIV/VHC.
66,9,">Hey, I'm not a lawyer and this is a joke. I just want to be clear about what the title means."
68,9,Vaccination is a major part of the healthcare system. They are not supporting it. They support it. They have no obligation to enforce them.
72,9,"That’s not funny at all. The fact that the jokes are being made based on the CDC's actions is just a bit atypical, and I think people need to realize that they are making a joke about what’s really being done in America. I’ve seen people say the CDC is invading the world and it’s the best thing to do, despite the fact that it may be a joke."
80,9,"In the title I see that the article is a joke, that's why he wrote the article."
84,9,"The word 'tiki' means 'tiki' and not 'tiki', which are also very similar to 'tiki.'"
90,9,"In fact, it would be a joke if you did that in public. They wouldn't use a mask to prevent HIV infection. They would probably ban it. They would do it all to get people sick, but if they didn't, they would have been in the wrong."
93,9,"This is going to suck to me. Unless the US gets to do whatever it wants with that money, it's gonna be the NSA. Unless we have a legitimate reason to believe it, then I'll just have to wait for this."
9,7,It is a joke. I think you are missing a bit of the nuances of the joke.
9,8,"I think the point is that the CDC is doing a lot to make it easier for people to make jokes about things that are actually not true. In fact, the headline doesn't make any sense."
24,9,"Vaccination is a joke. It's not a joke, and it's not racist at all."
26,9,A lot of people who have not been vaccinated have been told they're not going to be able to get the vaccine and haven't got it.
47,9,I'm in a hurry for this.
56,9,"The best thing to do is make a joke out of it, and use the'saber' to say it is a joke."
61,9,I want to make sure the whole thing is funny. Vaccination is an important part of the healthcare system. They are not doing anything to stop the spread of a virus.
66,9,Aaaaaand that's what I was thinking when I saw this.
68,9,"I think he's right in the sense that he believes there is a reason the ACA should not pass, and if the ACA passes he'll retaliate by saying he thinks it is racist."
72,9,That's very atypical. It's basically what is said when a joke is made about something.
80,9,It's an obvious prank and I love it when people say they want to make fun of me.
84,9,What is this a joke about?
90,9,It’s a joke. The CIA is using it to stop the spread of the virus.
93,9,"Are you a Republican or a Democrat? If so, it could be a good idea to just be a Republican."
9,7,I'm not a lawyer. I just...
9,8,"They aren't racist, they're just making jokes about Obamacare."
24,9,There's a lot of things that we're not saying are a joke and racist.
26,9,"It's a very complicated issue, but the issue is a lot more complicated."
47,9,"CANNOTANSWER THIS WITHOUT THE CDC, MADE BY THE US."
56,9,It's not like the CDC and the CIA are trying to make a joke about how the president is being racist.
61,9,"You just gave an idea. I don't know the reason, but I'm trying to keep things fresh. I think the first part of a big viral issue in a very difficult place is that they don't have vaccines."
66,9,This isn't a joke. It's a joke about a joke aimed at preventing the spread of the virus. It's a joke because of the joke. It's a joke about a joke because a joke that promotes a political agenda. It's a joke because it promotes a political agenda. It's a joke because it promotes a political agenda.
68,9,Vaccination is a joke. It is a joke. The CDC is trying to make fun of the ACA.
72,9,"I think a lot of people need to realize that the joke isn't a joke. Then they can say ""Oh, I thought the same thing was coming up with a joke about something I didn't see."""
80,9,"It’s the right answer, unless you’re going to say 'I hate the CDC'. It’s a joke because it’s a joke because of the government and is sexist.'"
84,9,The problem is that the government is trying to stop the spread of a virus. I don’t see how they will make it work and it’s just going to be a joke. Vaccination is a major threat to the health of the United States as well.
90,9,This sounds kind of like an erotic joke.
93,9,"The one thing you say in the title, ""Assuming you're not a troll, I would say the CIA is an insular entity, like the National Security Agency, but in a conspiracy."""
9,7,There is no legal reason to wear a mask. That’s just a law. They are trying to make a joke about the ACA and that’s why they are making a joke about the ACA.
9,8,"In any event, the article cited by the CDC is not true."
24,9,"It's not a joke. It's not racist, a racist joke."
26,9,Vaccination is the only way to stop the spread of a virus. The CDC has no interest in attempting to do that.
47,9,"You are being sarcastic and using words that can be used to communicate things like this is not good. There is no need for you to be a slut and the word can't be used to make jokes. I find it hard to believe that it's a joke, because it's not what it is."
56,9,The Obama Administration is trying to create a joke about the Obama administration '' twitchcon'' and it seems to be a joke about the Obamacare program.
61,9,"What about the ""what if I got a narwhal mask when I was 14."" argument?"
66,9,The guy isn't a joke. He's an apathetic fuck.
68,9,"You can't have a remark that isn't racist, you can't have an euphemism about that."
72,9,This article is not a joke. It is an article in fact.
80,9,It sounds like the CDC and the CDC have an agenda that is not actually political. That is why they have such a policy.
84,9,I don't want to hear about a joke about my dad who has to go to the doctor when he loses his mask a lot.
90,9,"I'm afraid there is a good chance the CIA is using the virus to make it better than the other jokes. If it were me, I'd be in the minority."
93,9,"The ""fucking white lie"" is a conspiracy theory."
9,7,"This is an entirely different issue, and it's true that the president has been trying to make a joke about the ACA."
9,8,"Vaccination isn't an option. It's a form of protection. In order to stop polio deaths, a man can wear a mask as long as he's not on a mask. If a man can't get a mask, then he shouldn't have to wear it. If he can't get one, then he shouldn't have to be vaccinated."
24,9,Vaccination is a joke. A joke. A joke.
26,9,"""There is a lot of shady stuff happening and"", ""In my state we've gone to a state fair and have an idea about what they have done for it. The one time I was asked to wear a mask, I said, ""No, not at this show. This is an extremely serious, but important topic."" (Feb 11, 2012)', ""I'm tired of being called a snoop and I'm just tired of being called a snooper"
47,9,The CDC is working on a shitstorm. I'm just putting my finger on it.
56,9,"Vaccination is not a joke because it is a joke. A prankster is a joke, but a joke is a joke."
61,9,"I'm a doctor here and we have a lot of jokes on this topic, I don't know if they're actually accurate, but we have many cliches here about the government trying to try to stop the spread of a virus."
66,9,Vaccination is a joke. That's why the first line is not in the title.
68,9,"This was written before the ACA came into effect, and the headline was about the health care laws that went into effect when it came into effect. Basically, a troll said that it isn't ""racist"" because it has nothing to do with the health care laws. This was a joke."
72,9,"No, a joke is a joke. It's not a joke. It's a joke."
80,9,"No. The quote is about the CDC, he's saying:"
84,9,"You're right - it's a joke and they're trying to make money off it, but it's a joke."
90,9,You're not being sarcastic - but it's a joke?
93,9,I read the title and was very shocked by the reaction.
9,7,"You seem to think the ""Never Wear a Mask"" joke is about the CDC and not the ACA?"
9,8,What's the joke? You blew me away - I'm pretty sure you're not. I'm not getting rid of the crappy ad - and the CDC is nefarious.
24,9,Vaccination is a joke.
26,9,I'm a guy and I'm not gonna lie. What I did was in the US military a long time ago and it seems like the CDC is not interested in preventing the spread of a virus.
47,9,"There's a difference between ""no jokes,"" ""no jokes"" and ""we aren't doing anything wrong."" And when I was a kid I'd say ""what is funny"" to people, but I wasn't really surprised about the CDC. It was a joke because it benefited my kid's life, but when I started reading that ""it's a joke, but it's not a joke."" But you also know what I mean. It was a joke."
56,9,CANNOTANSWER: I feel very bad because this whole thing is a joke about the US government. The CDC is trying to sue them for fraud. The joke doesn't get the humor right.
61,9,"The CDC is trying to stop the spread of the AIDS epidemic, by creating a joke to prevent the spread of HIV/VHC."
66,9,You're a joke.
68,9,They are not racists. They are not racist. They aren't racists. They are racists. They are racists. They are racists. They are racists.
72,9,"And he's a joke? You are the one that's making a joke, or you just wanted to put it in context."
80,9,Vaccination is a good way to prevent the spread of the virus. It is basically a way to protect your own health.
84,9,"""... I think it is a joke because they are trying to make it a joke about it."""
90,9,"> I think that the most ridiculous thing to do in the world. I think it's probably because of that ""intention"" of a troll and ""intention"" of the government."
93,9,A bit of a satire.
9,7,"It's also important to understand that we're on a subject that's not politically relevant, like the repeal of the ACA, not that the new health care legislation is the reason it's being blocked and censored."
9,8,"It's not a joke. I think it's a joke because it's about the CDC and their involvement with it. The ACA is a joke, but that's not why it's an awful idea. It's also why the government is trying to make the joke in the first place."
24,9,"I've been to all these vaccinating classes. And every single one of them has a great laugh. I can't get past this, though. You have to get it out there first - it's an important thing. And I think it's pretty important that you're not in your own home and your parents are home."
26,9,>Cannot stand the idea of a 'no joke'.
47,9,"The CDC is actually trying to try to prevent the spread of AIDS. They are trying to use hiveminds to prevent AIDS, not to prevent it from spreading."
56,9,"In the context of the title, I am saying that the phrase ""Cause a mask does not work with your nose"" doesn't necessarily mean ""you can't wear a mask""."
61,9,The joke is just one joke. They are trying to make a joke to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS. I'm not a racist.
66,9,"In a lot of cases, it's just a joke because the people in the story have no idea what the joke is and the person is just a shill."
68,9,"I can't even remember what the name of the twitchcon was. The post is on r/health (http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/fake-virus.jpg) and the title says that this subreddit does a lot of ""no-job"" references to the twitchcon. It's basically a twitchcon ad, so I think that the title's meant as ""what? What is the twitchcon?"
72,9,I read this on the radio.
80,9,The CDC does not have a number of rules and regulations. They do have a number of rules and regulations. They are able to do everything right and it's about the CDC. They have a number of rules and regulations. They are able to do everything right and it's about the CDC. They are able to do everything right and it's about the CDC's use of vaccines.
84,9,"Vaccination is important because it reduces the spread of HIV, and it prevents the spread of the disease, and is a serious concern for people who are at risk."
90,9,"I don't think that the CIA is using the virus to prevent HIV spread, nor does it look as though it's a joke, but it doesn't sound like a joke to me."
93,9,"Is NSA an insular entity? Because ""I'm not going to argue that the NSA is not a government entity."""
9,7,Is this what a lawyer said?
9,8,"The CDC has a problem with the ACA. If people can't wear a mask, they don't have to go to a doctor and have them check their blood sugar."
24,9,"The CDC is also trying to discredit the President for not being the best president ever, since the CDC is in charge of helping them out."
26,9,"""This is a terrible joke and is not supposed to stop."""
47,9,Vaccination is a joke because it's an important part of the health system. It isn't a joke because it's not a joke.
56,9,I have a problem with this idiom. A lot of jokes are the same and oftentimes they are the opposite. I have some funny things that are both humorous and a bit racist. A prankster isn't a joke. I can't stop joking about a joke.
61,9,A lot of the cliches in the world about the government being a scam to a CDC's benefit. The government is trying to make a joke to stop the spread of the virus. The CDC is trying to make a joke to stop the spread of AIDS. The ACA is a joke.
66,9,Vaccination is a joke. It isn't a joke because it promotes a political agenda.
68,9,"The CDC wants to make fun of the president, because he is a racist."
72,9,Vaccination is a joke. Vaccination is a joke.
80,9,Vaccination is not about the government. Vaccination is only for certain people. Vaccination is to protect the human body. You cannot force the government to vaccinate you because you don’t want to.
84,9,"This is one of the few examples of that being false. I’m very much looking for a better definition for the term “vaccination,” but I am trying to do a bit of a “smile” because it reflects my personal preferences for it a little bit."
90,9,"Basically, he has to take a big risk of AIDS. The other commenter can say that's ""a joke"" if they want, and the CIA wants to use the virus to stop that. They want to stop the spread of the AIDS because people get sick when they do anything. They are infecting millions of people worldwide, and the first reaction to a joke that could be a joke is to cut costs if the CIA are going to ban the vaccines and have people who do nothing infected (not just take care of those) to hospital."
93,9,"The article is misleading. The US has an anti-government view, if you like it."
9,7,There's no legal reason to not wear a mask.
9,8,"A lot of the comments I see on reddit that are trying to make fun of the president are actually actually actually talking about the ACA, and a lot of them are about a few other things, but the headline is a joke."
24,9,"Ingraham was a football coach, and he's now a NFL coach. He's being paid by a guy in a coma who was not vaccinated by him and he was in a coma, so he would have to wear a mask."
26,9,> A lot of people seem to think that wearing a mask to fend off their illnesses in order to stop the spread of a virus.
47,9,The jokes have become a joke. It's a joke because the jokes aren't the jokes.
56,9,I think it's pretty funny that the president seems to have a problem with the CDC and their efforts to do so.
61,9,"You don't use the term ""joke"" in any way."
66,9,You're a little biased. The name is a joke.
