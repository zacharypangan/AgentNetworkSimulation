21,16,"The thing is, she is a woman. The thing is, this is not a legit thing to do. The masks in her mouth are all so small and fragile. They're actually only used to hold in small doses. There is a reason that many people can't even wear them. They have to be very small to cover their nose and mouth with any sort of adhesive that's not necessary."
21,17,What if I told you about a virus? Is it a new one?
22,21,Oh man... I don't think this makes much sense.
43,21,"''A sham'' and ''Obama'' are two pretty big things. They are the government, not the players. I'm very surprised that it's ok not to wear a mask. But if they are, the truth is that it's a scam."
55,21,I can't stand the idea of wearing masks if you don't have the authority to do it.

58,21,"There's a book about them. Do the people not think it's ok to wear a mask? If so, they are wrong."
66,21,"When the government was pushed to make a mask necessary, that's what they did. Having the first option for players in the world to wear a mask isn't exactly a legitimate way. And if there was a problem with the other guys'helmets that were inappropriate, they would have to take them off, but that's where it got tricky."
68,21,TwitchCon doesn't have a mandate.
70,21,I have never wore a mask. That's all i have. I wore a mask as a kid and never even once wore a mask as a kid. I was a jerk.

75,21,I don't think they are just suggesting you go to twitchcon.
95,21,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
21,2,It doesn't make much sense for the people that go to events that have a mandate on them to wear masks.
21,12,"Awful, huh?"
21,16,There's one book about her about how people who do not know what to wear in the US are attempting to prevent people from being vaccinated. That's pretty funny and funny.
21,17,"I think you're on to something. The government is a fraud, and you should be pretty surprised that there are people who believe that wearing a mask can help stop a virus."
22,21,I'm going to say this about TWitchCon and masks you can hate me if the state town doesn't have an mandates you can hate me if the state town doesn't have an mandates you can hate me if the state town doesn't have an mandates you can hate me if the state town doesn't have an mandates you can hate me if the state town doesn't have an mandates you can hate me if the state town doesn't have an mandates you can hate me if the state town doesn't have an mandates
43,21,>(I'm sure that you have all the answers on this subject.
55,21,I don't think it's a scam.
56,21,We are talking about a scam that is made up of a bunch of people who have a problem with the government.
58,21,"That’s what I’m thinking, OP. I’m not sure what you mean by that. This isn’t a news article..."
66,21,It's a scam. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
68,21,"We can't have the mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask. And the whole ""witchcon is a mess"" thing is just stupid and stupid. It would be weird if there were any more laws in the U.S. about it, like ""as a vaccinated person with boosters i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear "
70,21,"I'm just going to tell you that you can't have a decent job without wearing a mask. The only way to prevent this is by telling me to ""swim my way out the window and take a breath."" If someone said they were going to go out and smoke I'd get it fixed. It isn't a good way to start, but it's an easy way to find someone else."
72,21,> Where do I sign up to be a commissioner for a hs or hs hs team?
75,21,I was just thinking about this. But... What was the meaning of the phrase?
95,21,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
21,2,"I mean, as much as I dislike the fuck out of this, I know that a mask is a good way to do so. But when a government official tells you to suck a sour taste, he thinks 'if you don't suck a sour taste, that's just disgusting'."
21,12,he's not going to do it. I'm going to he's going to have to go to a lot of things.
21,16,This is what I found out.
21,17,You said it because you are not going to twitchcon. It's the only way to keep from being vaccinated and is your job. It's a scam. We are talking about a scam that is made up of a bunch of people who have a problem with the government. I'm going to say this about TWitchCon and masks. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of a virus. We can't have the mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters
22,21,> Putting on a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of a virus. Please wear a mask.
43,21,"I was vaccinated for the first time in a couple of years. So I lost it, and I got the virus, but I have no proof. I had a couple months'experience wearing a mask, and it did get me through the CDC and my school."
55,21,"I’m not sure how to tell what I’m thinking, but I’ve read about people who wear masks to get vaccinated. I was a former RN, and now I don’t know why. The truth is:"
56,21,It is one of the reasons I don’t know whether the CDC is actually trying to prevent the spread of the virus.
58,21,"You have never actually been in a position of power. If you have been the President's ally in the past, then your decision to end the policy based on the last one is a blaming move. If you are currently the President, then you are on your own."
66,21,"Apparently all of the CDC, FA, and CDC are involved with the use of the government's tools to control the spread of a virus."
68,21,"I'm a little embarrassed to say I can't see the implication of wearing a mask at TwitchCon, though."
70,21,"Despite the fact that the CDC's goal is to have a full blown vaccine that could prevent a lot of the spread of a virus, there's just no way of knowing if it's even real or not, since most of the current vaccines aren't proven to work."
72,21,"There is a federal government that can do anything. If it isn't in your state, you need to go to your county health department to get a new one."
75,21,"The arachnovirus is a contagious disease that can be treated by taking a very severe bite from a mask. The disease is also commonly known as a fever and is associated with an autoimmune disease. It is a deadly disease that has developed on the ribcage in human tissue. It isn't necessarily immune to it, but can be able to live a long, healthy life without a mask. It is also called an infection (not a contagious disease) and hasn't been recorded."
95,21,"The part that made me think that a prank was the point of the joke. A prank was something like, ""Oh you dont like wearing your mask, I have been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that oh you dont like wearing your mask, and I've been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that. It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
21,2,"I'm going to put the mask on at TWitchCon and show that there is nothing illegal about the masks being worn. The masks aren't illegal in most places, as I'm just pointing out."
21,12,"""Well, I'm going to go to a lot of things. This whole thing is a scam. I'm going to have to go to a lot of things."
21,16,I don't think that's a legitimate excuse for putting on a mask. Is that just another one of those things that the government is actually doing?
21,17,I thought I'd be the first to ask because this was a hacked joke
22,21,"As a US citizen who lost my mask 4 times on a 4th day, I wouldn't recommend it."
43,21,"He was vaccinated. You can't go n' go sexy on his helmet, though."
55,21,">Don't wear a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things things I've done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things I lose a mask at least four times a day. I have to change out my helmet in the beginning of the year when my husband was in the army, but I was able to get him vaccinated. I can't stand the idea of wearing a mask, and"
56,21,"Yes, it is a scam."
58,21,"And then, by saying this, you mean it was Trump's decision, not the people who made the decision. The truth is that it's a bad idea."
66,21,"I'm really sorry, but the title is incorrect. I'm pretty sure the guy that is doing it is a scam. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of a virus."
68,21,>As a vaccinated person with boosters i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask.
70,21,"There's the ""Faceless"" acronym, a word that 'can be used as a cover for different types of virus. It's a way of saying ""i've never worn a mask."" If someone says they're going to go out and smoke, I'd get it fixed. If someone said they were going to go out and smoke, I'd get it fixed. It's an easy way to find someone else."
72,21,You are a very smart dude.
75,21,"As someone who lives in the United States, this is a little too crazy for the American people."
95,21,"I think the wording of the first two is funny, but I'm not sure what he was trying to say at all."
21,2,I don't know how many Americans have been diagnosed with arachnovirus and I wonder what they are doing with them? Is the vaccine still available?
21,12,Is it really a scam?
21,16,The only reason that my husband wouldn't wear it at least four times per day is because he wouldn't have been vaccinated and so his wife didn't want to wear it.
21,17,You're doing something wrong.
22,21,I've learned that the people with DM's are scared of the NSA.
43,21,"The biggest problem is when a player gets fucked. They can't even tell the truth, so it's probably too easy. I’m just an uninformed individual that I’ve never heard of any such thing. If I had known my father who was a lawyer I’d tell him to leave the state. If I had known my father who was a lawyer I’d tell him to leave the state. If I had known his father who was a lawyer I’d tell him to leave the state. If a politician is an immigrant then he"
55,21,[Down to the question](http://www.reddit.com/r/opinions/r/askscience/relationship/relationships/askscience/).
56,21,"Vaccination is illegal. In this case, it's the US that's pulling the plug."
58,21,"The first thing I thought of after reading this post was if someone in the White House was a little upset about the president's attitude toward the administration's treatment of the military, but I was very upset for the guy who put on a mask."
66,21,"As a kid in the US, he was asked how to go about it. He said ""I'm sorry, but the title is incorrect. I'm pretty sure the guy that is doing it is a scam."" He's talking about a mask and getting vaccinated."
68,21,"It was a joke, but now it's a real problem."
70,21,"It's a big issue, but it's a big one."
72,21,"I don't think you know much about the topic, but the CDC says that wearing a mask is helping prevent the spread of a virus. The CDC has already said that vaccinations are necessary to prevent the spread of the virus. The CDC is also claiming that HIV/AIDS is not part of the virus and is trying to discourage the spreading of the virus."
75,21,">As someone who lives in the United States, this is a little too crazy for the American people."
95,21,It's a prank. It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

21,17,"Why don't you ask if you are a citizen or a senator to sign a form and say it, then if you are not you are a senator."
22,21,This is one of the worst ad I've seen for a while. I was a US citizen with a DM (I lost my first mask) and got a mask to prevent the spread of my symptoms.
43,21,The question is if this is a legitimate reason to have no one come to pick you up and leave. Besides you might be the only one that is aware of the health issue with vaccines. I'd leave a big one.
55,21,"A lot of these comments don't have a connection with the actual topic of this question, and I'm pretty sure you're talking to someone whose attitude was uninformed, and who is really just being facetious."
56,21,I feel like that sounds like a lot of shit.
58,21,"That's a really good question. I'd rather see the white house explain to the president what was going on at that time. That it's not funny, or that the people aren't funny. What is the issue?"
66,21,Vaccination is supposed to be a step in the right direction for the public health of the world to keep the vaccines current and infected by the population. There is no good answer here.
68,21,It's a joke.
70,21,"I would be in trouble for not wearing a mask, but it sounds like he is trying to rip people off to stop the spread of a virus."
72,21,"I've a friend who is a medical professional who doesn't get the vaccines. She's wearing one, and she can't wear a mask. And she's not a medical doctor, so she's not legally entitled to wear one."
75,21,[Like what?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_SexyMale/)
95,21,"The prank that is being made by the government isn't about the prank, the prank is based on what he's told you. If you don't like the idea of the prank, why do you want to get a prank? I mean, I know what the prank is. I don't want to be the prankster, but I want to keep my mouth shut."
21,2,You can't 'do that' by wearing a mask.' I'm gonna say:
21,12,I'm not sure how much of a joke or joke is about this.
21,16,There are multiple ways to keep a person from getting sick.
21,17,"If you don't know about the CDC, don't sign up for it."
22,21,"If you can't be sure, then don't use the mask at all, the CDC is only on your side."
43,21,I agree that you should have a safety and sexy mask and not something that you are able to do. You can do anything for a living in the world where it's not legal.
55,21,"[[Although they're pretty ok](http://www.reddit.com/r/opinions/r/askscience/relationship/relationships/askscience/). I'm a big fan of the anti-vaccine nonsense of it. CDC trying to deter and prevent the spread of a virus. The thing about having an irrational assumption about the President's actions is that, for all the good of us, he has to be out of office."
56,21,"You've said ""afaik"" before? That's like saying you're a troll."
58,21,">I think it's fair that they are bringing a shitload of people into this discussion because they're not a big deal, So in my case, it's just that they are bringing a shitload of people into this discussion because they're not a big deal, So in my case, it's just that they are bringing a shitload of people into this discussion because they're not a big deal."
66,21,This is not a scam. This is not a scam. It is a scam. The government does not care about the health of the public or their citizens.
68,21,"It's not a joke, but it's the government sabotage."
70,21,This is like the whole fucking NSA's job.
72,21,">I think a person can go to twitchcon without a mask, and it i don't think he's a troll."""

(This is not a joke) They've been able to stop the spread of the virus. I'm allergic to fucking the shit about the s"
21,2,I'm not even familiar with this.
21,12,"As someone with allergies, I can say that this is a prank."
21,16,Is the CDC sabotage what they're doing?
21,17,"So your friend is a doctor who is not a doctor who doesn't get the vaccines? Why are you being so critical of a prankster? You should know what a prank is, but you shouldn't be a prankster because of how you feel about your friend."

56,21,I don't think the president is a conspiracy nut. I think it is a silly joke.
58,21,"I think the real thing is that this is a joke, that the White House is trying to get rid of the president's mask."
66,21,A lot of people who get sick are not going to get vaccines. And the health care system isn't going to stop it.

21,17,"The CDC is trying to stop the spread of a virus, it isn't a joke. It's not. Is the CDC sabotage? Because it is. They've been able to stop the spread of a virus. Is this something that has happened, even in our current system?"

68,21,I think the issue is the health of the people who are infected and how important it is to protect them from the virus.

21,2,"This is a very sad story. This is a very sad, tragic story."
21,12,This is the best part of the story and the only reason people want to do it is because they feel that they need to prevent a large number of illnesses that are not due to them and people who want to get sick aren't allowed to wear a mask.

43,21,"That's all about your job. You're going to have to do what's right for you. You want to work, you need to live, you have to work hard, and then you can work hard."
55,21,"I see you've tried to say, ''I can't stand the idea of wearing a mask if you don't have the authority to do it.''' You have tried to say, 'I can't stand the idea of wearing a mask'', but you didn't."
56,21,"It is not a scam. It's an insurgency and I think the government is not helping, and that is probably an important step in the process of making it worse. The CIA is a troll, and there isn't anything wrong with that."
58,21,I don't know what I mean by that. They aren't funny at all. They are a joke.
66,21,>This is not a scam. This is not a scam.
68,21,I don't think it was a joke or a joke. Is there a good reason to wear a mask that protects you from the virus? Isn't it really racist if you use it at a joke?
70,21,CANNOTANSWER is a fan of the Bush Administration. The problem is that people think it's ridiculous for people to wear a mask to fend off their illnesses in order to stop the spread of a virus.
72,21,The best way to prevent this is to cut off and use a mask. The CDC is compelled to stop any 'harrassment' they are doing against the laws of the US.
75,21,"[""Making the masks a prank is. People wear masks in public to prevent the spread of a virus."
95,21,"Yes! Those are all pranks. It's one of those pranks that I really don't care about any more. I really don't care what anyone thinks. I don't care what anyone thinks, but I do care what they think."
21,2,"I know I'm not going to be an expert on the NSA, but I think the NSA is being an asshole and that if you say that I don't know what you're talking about, then they should probably just ban it."
21,12,He says he is the one who needs to go to the CDC and then they have to stop the NSA from doing it. I don't think the CDC is the one. I think the NSA is a nut. They are sabotage. They are trying to get rid of the President's mask.
21,16,I was the only one who thought the CDC was a joke.
21,17,I'm not sure who you're going to call this shit?
22,21,Using a fake mask to avenge infected people is really a prank. The fact that the CDC is on your side isn't what it sounds like.
43,21,He's referencing the fact that CDC is in the process of making a ban on the helmet.
55,21,I'm not sure what a doctor would do if the doctor was able to put on a mask and go to the doctor. It is also important to know what the mask is designed to prevent. This is also important because if the doctor didn't have the time to vaccinate the patient that's what the doctor had to do.
56,21,Vaccination is legal in the US and not an insurgency.
58,21,"I mean I'd rather hear the president explain to a politician that is trying to end Obama's anti-vaccine policy rather than his wife, who was also in the military."
66,21,It's really hard to believe that you're just a real friend.
68,21,I am just being an asshole. It's the CDC who is trying to change the law to stop the spread of the virus.
70,21,I see alot of the people complaining about it in the comments. So many in this thread. It's kind of annoying.
72,21,> I want to go on and try and convince my friends and family to have their sex in public. What about me? You're a troll. And you're a racist?
75,21,I can't imagine he is even a part of the problem.
95,21,"Why didn't he tell you it was a prank? Because he knows what it is and he is not trying to make a joke about it, that's not a joke, and if he is being a prankster, it would be very funny to not care what someone thinks."
21,2,The fact that people think it's ridiculous for people to wear a mask to fend off their illnesses in order to stop the spread of a virus.
21,12,"That is what s a prank is. It's not a prank, it's a prank."
21,16,"So, this was done by a nut at some point, or the CDC had nothing to do with it."
21,17,A doctor who is allergic to viruses is not being able to stop the spread of a virus. It's not what you were just referencing.
22,21,I've heard a few comments stating that wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of a virus.
43,21,"As a former CDC patient I have never heard of the ""fake"" thing."
55,21,"> I feel like the problem is that people don't understand the role the government is playing here."", ""I’m not surprised at all."
56,21,"That's because, to me, it makes us all vulnerable to diseases. I don't want people with the same health issues to be subjected to the same kind of things. And in this particular situation, it isn't a good joke, but it isn't a problem, it's a problem."
58,21,"The issue is that the president’s mask isn’t a joke, it’s an unfortunate joke."
66,21,>I am not a lawyer and this is a scam.
68,21,"You are the CDC, not the CDC."
70,21,"What I would say is, ""Faceless"" is a good way to get people to think about how it might affect them, and how they would respond when people say, ""I know you're sick, but I'm going to make the joke about it, I don't know you're sick."""
72,21,You're not a racist.
75,21,"I think you're being a bit obtuse, you are a jerk."
95,21,"Unless he knows what it is and he is not trying to make a joke about it, that's not a joke."
21,2,"I'd say that it's not a prank, and a legitimate reason for it. The ""Potentially Racist"" guy made it sound like he was trying to make it a joke. He said it because ""It's a good joke"" and it made it sound like he was doing it wrong."
21,12,*You're not a racist.* You're a racist.
21,16,This isn't an anti-vaccination joke.
21,17,... and you're going to make the CDC go fuck itself.
22,21,It's called the Devil Wears Masks.
43,21,"I don't understand why people have so much fun to do when a president of the United States supposedly just lied and said ""I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer."""
55,21,The idea of wearing a mask is a joke. Vaccination is a scam.
56,21,"So I'm just saying that if I lose my mask every year I can't get my apnea checked and am at the hospital putting down my fever, and I have to leave the hospital to get it checked. Why do people think I should be in that hospital so long? Because if I get it checked in at least four times a day I'm probably going to get it checked and then I can tell you it's not going to be able to get it fixed. So I think the government tries to be a scam. But it's not that"
58,21,"So this isn't a good joke, just something that would be interesting to watch for the long run?"
66,21,"Vaccination is a great tool for the population. The CDC, FA, and CDC are involved with the use of the government's tools to stop the spread of a virus. It's a joke. It's just not. It's a scam. It's a scam."
68,21,Is it racist if I do that?
70,21,"I believe the CDC is the one that's taking over the nation in protecting them from the spread of the virus. The CDC is a powerful organization that wants to create and promote more awareness of what happens when you are sick. Besides, I don't really think you can be a racist or racist to have such a serious issue."
72,21,They're trying to put people down with this sort of thing and put you at risk for it. The whole thing is a'snoop' with the US government and it is a BS/Bulletin.
75,21,I think it's a very good point to have to go to the CIA.
95,21,"You know, if he is not making a joke about it, he is making a joke. It sounds like he is being a prankster."
21,2,I read something recently that said:
21,12,I was just sitting here laughing out loud.
21,16,"I'm from the U.S. and I've never seen a CDC spokesperson do anything illegal with a mask, but I'm glad to say I've had an experience where I lost one at least twice a day and it took me 5 years to get my apnea checked, but it was not an effective solution. This is the kind of thing people who wear masks are able to do, but they are also being able to not wear any other form of protection as they are being exposed to apnea and other issues."
21,17,I believe that he was trying to make a joke about a virus.
22,21,[Scandal in the CDC's FAQ:
43,21,The truth is: It's not a joke. It's a joke. The truth isn't a joke.
55,21,So the question is what do you think about this in the context of the first post?
56,21,I’m gonna go ahead and say “I don’t think it’s a joke. I think it’s a joke.”
58,21,"I feel like some of the responses from the commenters are not sexist, but are also sexist. The article is pretty much a commentary on the fact that it's a joke."
66,21,"It's a joke, but it isn't a joke."
68,21,"Vaccination is a crucial part of the healthcare system. It is necessary for people to get vaccines and other medications, so that they don't become a public health threat. It's also a crucial component of making sure people can get vaccinations, which in turn reduces the chance of dying. There is a big difference between being vaccinated and being in the government."
70,21,"That isn't the whole point of this, it is the basic point of the CDC and the Obama administration, to prevent an epidemic - to do it in a way that is less harmful. Those people may not think of themselves as racist or racist, but they may think the joke is a joke."
72,21,I think there is a bigger issue here than the CDC is trying to solve. There is no law about the CDC allowing the government to enforce anything. Vaccines are a problem.
75,21,"It's not a prank. Vaccines are not only necessary to stop the spread of HIV, but they are also not necessary to prevent the spread of any other disease. That's why they are deemed a prank."

43,21,That's a joke. A joke.
55,21,"Vaccination is actually a form of aid to prevent HIV/AIDS infection, which could potentially be more helpful. It can also help keep the bacteria from spreading more widely and reduce the risk of infection in the body. The vaccine is part of the effort to stop HIV and helps prevent HIV/AIDS from spreading to other people who are susceptible to a host of diseases."

21,12,I'm going to have to say this is a really stupid thing to say.

This was to show people who are currently infected that are willing to risk becoming ill. I think the CDC should be able to give him the benefit of the doubt and help him in doing it. This is really the only prank I've heard that made sense.

43,21,The CDC has been making a ban on wearing a mask. Afaik is not a joke.
55,21,"If you're not familiar with the issue, you should never take a mask off on a visit."
56,21,I think this doc needs to be upped.
58,21,The only reason they are making the ACA removed is because they don't want to eliminate the ACA.

70,21,"CANNOTANSWER has no idea what it means to not wear a mask. He's saying that if you don't wear a mask you're in danger and can't do anything about it and you're not in danger, and you're getting sick because your health is compromised. So what the Obama administration wants to do is to provide them with more information about the virus rather than to sell it to a person or party."

22,21,"If a joke were to come up that says ""I'm a lawyer, and I'm not interested in going to the White House"" then it's probably a joke. ""I'm not interested in going to the White House."""
43,21,"He's just saying that his joke isn't a joke. If it were for the CDC, it would be just a joke. Vaccination is the best way to stop the spread of the virus."
55,21,The CDC wants to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS. The CDC wants to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS. The CDC wants to prevent it. The CDC wants to prevent it. It's a joke.
56,21,He's trying to come out as one of the worst ad hominem nuts in history.
58,21,A joke isn't a joke.
66,21,Vaccination is the best way to stop the spread of the virus. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of the virus.
68,21,"Vaccination is critical to prevent spreading and prevention of disease. And it is critical that people get sick, because they don’t have to get the vaccine if they are vaccinated. Vaccination is important for the protection of people, and is not a joke, but it is the best way to stop the spread of the virus."
70,21,"I just don't understand how it's a joke. There's a joke about the president wearing a mask to fight off an illness, not a joke about how he's getting sick."
72,21,"Vaccines are not a joke, because they are not legal. The people using them aren't people who are raped or shit. It isn't a joke that doesn't make any sense to you."
75,21,Is this a really good example of a racist conspiracy theory or a conspiracy theory?
95,21,"Nope. This isn't a joke, it's a joke."
21,2,Vaccines are a very serious medical effect on human health and life. The CDC and CIA are both powerful entities and they aren't even the most powerful organization to defend the country.
21,12,"I think that is the point of a joke, and I feel bad for the president."
21,16,"If you want to get a cdc, I would, but it's not a joke, so there's that."
21,17,I'm gonna go on and on about how the CDC is trying to force people to get vaccinated.
22,21,"As an American, I have to say, I genuinely feel like it's wrong that the CDC is suing him for this."
43,21,Vaccination is not a joke. It's an attempt to prevent and prevent the spread of the virus.
55,21,This is not a joke at all.
56,21,"This ad-hoc version of the joke, the one about a person who is a prankster and who isn't a doctor."
58,21,"I've been in the military for 8 years. My wife went through this all the time with the ACA and my daughter, the two of them were all vaccinated. I think the President is trying to prevent the spread of a virus. I feel like the president is trying to make the president look bad, because they don't want to eliminate the ACA."
66,21,Vaccination is the best way to stop the spread of the virus. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of the virus.
68,21,"What's the point of the joke if people get sick from the same vaccinations? Vaccination is critical to stop spreading of the virus. I'm not racist, I know no joke."
70,21,I'm going to leave this out to a bunch of other things.
72,21,">I think the best way to prevent this is to cut off and use a mask. The CDC is compelled to stop any 'harrassment' they are doing against the laws of the US."""
75,21,CANNOTANSWER ON THE ACT NOW! The whole thing is a mish-mash.
95,21,"So when he says, ""I'm allergic to anything, and it's called a prank. It's called a prank""? I'm allergic to a lot of viruses, but not to the sprite."
21,2,They're doing a pretty good job of keeping people out.
21,12,You seem to be saying that the President's Mask is the only way to stop people getting sick because he would have been vaccinated? Not the one that you mentioned.
21,16,What about you? What are you going to do when you get sick and are unable to get your shit checked? I've had that happen to me a couple times in my life. What do you do if you are in the military?
21,17,"My friend grew up in an environment where we don't use sunscreen. She used to have a lot of sunscreen. The CDC wasn't very aggressive about not keeping her skin clean or cleaning her hair. Apparently they just wanted to stop people from being vaccinated, not to cause a problem."
22,21,What are some examples of a joke?
43,21,"As an American who is not a lawyer, I have to admit, I am very aware of the CDC and their policies. And if they're doing it for their own political advantage they're doing it for the same reason. It's not like the CDC is actually working on the virus... but that's another thing. If they were in charge of the CDC, that would be a joke."
55,21,The president isn't really doing anything. I think you're missing the point of the first sentence.
56,21,Vaccination is not a joke. It’s a joke.
58,21,"I've seen one of these posts in the past, and haven't read it in about 2 days."
66,21,I am a lawyer and have never heard of someone using a mask to prevent or prevent infection.
68,21,Vaccination is important and is the best way to stop the spread of the virus. Vaccination is not racist.
70,21,"So, this is a joke about a joke about the idea of ""you can't be a racist because you're sick, but you're not in danger.""."
72,21,"I like the quote because if you want to tell me something, please let me know."
75,21,You don't like the fact that it was a joke. You want to say that the CIA is the only organization in the world that is not helping the CDC? Because I think you are wrong.
95,21,"CANNOTANSWER - In this case, it sounds like he's talking about the prank and trying to make fun of a person who's a virus bitch."
21,2,"CANNOTANSWER - In this case, it sounds like he's talking about the prank and trying to make fun of the president."
21,12,"I think that you're being a bit harsh about the whole thing. I don't think he's going to go in for any actual therapy and I'll get sick, but it's going to get worse. And he's going to re-examine what he does and say, ""Oh my god! This is ridiculous! This is terrible."""
21,16,This is where it's at.
21,17,CANNOTANSWER ON THE ACT NOW!
22,21,I don’t really understand why a person would be so blatantly referring to this as a joke. It’s just a snide joke.
43,21,Are you sure that you have all the answers on this subject? Because you don't.
55,21,I think the point is that the point is not in what the article says. I think it is in the same context that the person who wrote it is saying that there are other people who could get vaccinated.
56,21,"A prankster, not a joke? Not a joke."
58,21,It seems like this has been a lot of jokes about the president. You have to be very careful with the comments.
66,21,Vaccination is a joke because it is a joke. They're trying to spread it. That's a joke.
68,21,The CDC is a troll company.
70,21,>Is AIDS a joke?'
72,21,I'm going to go ahead and say that I am very sorry for you and your friends. I am not a racist.
75,21,The CDC is trying to stop a virus that isn't currently being screened. They are going to put it in public if you are vaccinated.
95,21,The prank focuses on the fact that you are allergic to viruses. You are allergic to all the viruses. I think a lot of people are getting offended by this.
21,2,I'm allergic to the sour taste and I'm allergic to some sour stuff. My allergy is not a problem at all. I don't know why people think that it's a prank.
21,12,"This is the first time I've heard someone say ""We have a very difficult time being a joke about our national security needs and we want to do it. We need to make sure the president gets the help he needs."""
21,16,Is it not a joke? I don't understand it. Vaccination isn't racist. Is it a joke?
21,17,...I think a lot of people are getting offended by this.
22,21,This is a joke. It's not a joke.
43,21,What about a ban on wearing a mask to stop the spread of a virus?
55,21,It's a joke because there's no way to know who's right or wrong and who should've been wrong. Vaccination is a joke.
56,21,"As an American who plays for a major baseball team. My friend and I are playing games together. During the finals game in 2008, my friend and I were playing a game together at the National Arena. We played games together a few years later and when we were doing this, we went to a chess game and he was doing a really well game. We played chess together at the National Basketball Center."
58,21,"I'm not sure what this is, but I would be upset about the person who said it."
66,21,Vaccination is a joke because it prevents or prevents the spread of the virus. People do not understand how the CDC has used masks as a way to stop the spread of the virus. People do not understand how a CDC isn't racist. It's a joke because it promotes a political agenda.
68,21,What is a joke? It's racist.
70,21,This is not a joke. It is a joke. This is a joke.
72,21,"It would be a joke if you just cut off and wear a mask. It's a joke because it prevents the spread of the virus. It's a joke because of the ""right to keep locked in the house."""
75,21,"This guy is one of the most outrageously hateful people I've ever seen. I don't think this guy is in fact a racist conspiracy theorist, just a racist who is so outlandish to be considered a sexist and racist as to say it's a prank."
95,21,You are allergic to viruses. I can tell you that in some ways. A prank is a joke.
21,2,"CANNOTANSWER - In this case, it sounds like he's talking about the prank and trying to make fun of the president."
21,12,The only way a prank is not a joke is to get attention and get some attention. This is why I play the game and I've been laughing about it.
21,16,"This seems like a pretty funny idea to me. I think there are a lot of jokes coming out of this post because of this. It's a good idea to make the people on the front page laugh at this one because it's not a joke, but because this was written by a guy and it's a joke to me."
21,17,>I am gonna go ahead and say that I am very sorry for you and your friends. I am not a racist.
22,21,It's a joke.
43,21,"""Is it a joke?"""
55,21,There's a very good reason why they're trying to make a joke out of this.
56,21,Vaccination is illegal in the US and not an insurgency.
58,21,"A lot of people are blaming the president for not getting vaccine, but they're trying to get a joke because the president is an evil person. It's not a joke."
66,21,"He threw up and was shot. He was probably being a jerk stating he thought a joke would be okay if he did. He was being a jerk. He's not saying he's a jerk, he's saying he's just not the kind of guy who wants to get rid of the virus. I'm just saying he didn't believe it was a joke and that's just that he got shot. He's just not a joke."
68,21,Are the CDC trying to force people to get vaccinations?
70,21,"I'm actually a bit confused, as the CDC is the government's response to a new viral disease."
72,21,It's funny to think the fact that we can have this joke is what 'takers' mean.
75,21,>Is the CDC and CIA a troll or a conspiracy theorist?''
95,21,"I am allergic to all the viruses. I am allergic to the sprite, but not to the sprite."
21,2,"""As long as it's a joke."""
21,12,"As someone with allergies who also have allergies, I think that this is a good idea to be a part of it. The joke is about preventing a virus from spreading but the CDC isn't getting it to stop it from spreading. You're talking about a joke about an actual prank and the President's mask is not just for preventing the spread of the virus. He was being a jerk, he was not being a jerk."
21,16,You mean a joke about a joke that you don't care about?
21,17,What's the reason that people think it's racist?
22,21,"This makes sense. What a joke. This is the joke, I'm afraid."
43,21,It is. A joke. A joke. A joke. A joke. A joke. And a joke. But not a joke.
55,21,The CDC wants to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS. They want to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS.
56,21,"I've had a few people say it was a joke. I've had some people say it's a joke, and others say it's a joke. I was told that the joke is a joke aimed at the US, and that people have no idea what the joke is or what it's called in some sense."
58,21,"""The first one isn't a joke. It's a joke. The truth is that vaccination is the best way to stop the spread of a virus. The CDC, the CDC, the FBI and the US Department of Homeland Security have to do what they think is best to keep the government safe. That's not an argument, but they think it's a joke. They are trying to make the president look bad, because they want the government to protect them."""

68,21,It's about a joke. What is the point? The CDC is trying to force people to get vaccines. What's the point of getting vaccinated?

75,21,Is this just a prank?
95,21,I think the pranks are meant as a joke. A prank is a joke because it's based on a joke and they tell it is based on it.
21,2,"i feel like it was very interesting to read about these pranks as an American. you must be aware of the kind of people who wear masks, especially those with severe ear infections."
21,12,"Yes, you can use it to help the president keep the country safe, but it's not a joke."
21,16,"If you are not American, this is a real problem and not an actual joke."
21,17,I'm getting the feeling that you would say something that would make people uncomfortable if they knew it was a joke and the CDC was just trying to force you to do it. That was just not enough to make a joke.
22,21,"My grandfather was the same age as you. He was on the government's side with his kids. My dad and I got together one day and went to a show, and we joked about it a lot. We sat there and got to the front page with the ""I was not happy with that joke, but I feel like I do like it, because we've done it so much."" We joked about it a lot, and I was able to talk to some strangers and tell him about it."
43,21,"This is why we don't make it about vaccines. It's not about vaccines. It's about the government, not the government itself. It's about the government trying to stop the spread of AIDS."
55,21,"""I've actually heard a story from a RN who was on HIV/AIDS when he was the governor of Texas."
56,21,"This is a great joke, but the word is a little misleading, because it's a joke, and it doesn't mean that it isn't a joke, it means a joke, which it certainly isn't."
58,21,"There isn't a ""joke"" about the ACA. It's the ""joke"" that is referring to the health care program that prevents people from getting HIV/AIDS in their lifetime. It's the ""joke"" that causes the problem and not the joke."
66,21,Vaccination is a joke because it prevents the spread of the virus. People do not understand how the CDC has used masks as a way to stop the spread of the virus.
68,21,"""The CDC is a troll who is trying to force people to get vaccines."","
70,21,"I'm not surprised, given the current situation."
72,21,"I don't think we have a lot of people that don't wear masks in the US, but they've got a pretty large number of people in it. They're not saying that you can't have a mask, but that it's good and not a joke."
75,21,The CDC and the CIA are trying to use the AIDS vaccine as an anti-vaccination tool for some non-governmental organizations to help prevent the spread of the disease.
95,21,The article states that the pranks on his post aren't pranks. They're pranks. They're pranks.
21,2,I don't understand why people are uncomfortable to think that it's ridiculous.
21,12,"What? If they want to prevent a virus and not make people think about it and are actually helping, then it's not a joke."
21,16,"A good joke, but a prank. Not a joke. A joke. You should read a dr. John Lennon book."
21,17,They are going to try and force people to get vaccinated if it's a joke.
22,21,I like how you put the two statements together:
43,21,The CDC is claiming it is going to have a negative effect on our health.
55,21,"Vaccination is a joke. It’s a joke, but the joke makes a lot of shit."
56,21,"I think it was the CIA prank, it was a joke."
58,21,I figured that one was a joke. You're a joke. You're a joke.
66,21,"In the USA there are a number of health care agencies including the US Department of Health and Human Services, CDC, and CDC."
68,21,...but I'm not being racist.
70,21,CANNOTANSWER is a fan of the Bush Administration. The problem is that people think it's ridiculous for people to wear a mask to fend off their illnesses in order to stop the spread of a virus.

75,21,"""I can't say that the CIA and the CDC are trying to use the AIDS vaccine as an anti-vaccination tool for some non-governmental organizations to help prevent the spread of the disease."
95,21,So it seems a prankster would be allergic to his pranks because he isn't trying to make a joke about them? I've heard that's how people interpret pranks. Then again I think it's the way you talk about this.
21,2,"I think it's kind of hard to believe how often pranks are made to get people to 'get the meds,' or that they're pranks, and then not even be able to take them seriously. I think some people are uncomfortable with what they think is an outrageous joke or something to the point of the point where they aren't making fun of the fact that they don't know the actual facts, so they just do the right thing by pretending they have no reason to try."
21,12,"People are going to feel like a kid with autism, so we need to just leave it as it is."
21,16,I really don't see why people have to wear masks at the end of the day.
21,17,"No, he was taking a joke on his friend. He was trying to make a joke about the CDC."
22,21,You know what the CDC does is essentially a joke.
43,21,It's the best possible solution.
55,21,"""Put on a mask if you don't have the authority to do it."
56,21,It's like saying I don't get the CDC's approval because I'm a joke.
58,21,"Vaccination is a joke because the President's not able to do it. I don't think that is a joke, but the article points out that the President is trying to get rid of his mask to stop the spread of a virus."
66,21,> Vaccination is a joke because it prevents or prevents the spread of the virus.
68,21,"I know you want me to say that...I think that's a joke, a joke is a joke."
70,21,"Basically, this is why I don't want to talk to you. I'm trying to find out how the joke works. It's also not about being a jerk."
72,21,It's a joke because they're trying to annoy people.
75,21,No? The CDC and the CIA aren't the worst of all the shit out there.
95,21,It's called a prank because the idea of a prank is based on something. A prank is not a joke but a joke because it's based on a joke.
21,2,You're in the wrong place. Your friends need to know more about this shit and to suck their sour taste. That's a pretty big problem.
21,12,"I've heard a lot of people have jokes about putting on masks, and not just if it's just a joke. But I don't think they can be racist."

22,21,"It's a joke because people are being lied to in an attempt to make it a joke. It's a joke because it is a joke, because the government is trying to make a joke. That's not how it works."
43,21,"The CDC is going to do an all-nighter campaign on sexism and health and public health. The president is being the best at it, but if he's denying anything to the public he's essentially being a joke."
55,21,"The joke isn't a joke, it's an idea, and the idea is not a joke."
56,21,You don't want to hear about the government in a bad light.
58,21,The first one isn't a joke. It's a joke because the president is trying to make it look bad. Vaccination is a joke because it promotes a political agenda.
66,21,"No. It's a joke. It's a joke because it's racist. It's a joke because it's racist. It's a joke because it promotes a political agenda. It’s a joke because it promotes a political agenda. The CDC and NSA would be suing the government, which is why they are suing the government, which is why they are suing the government."
68,21,The CDC is making fun of it. It is racist because it is not a joke. It is also racist because it is racist because it is not a joke.
70,21,I would love to learn more about the virus and what it does and what they want from it. What the people in the comments think it does. It is a joke that is not about the virus and doesn't want to be a joke.
72,21,Vaccines are not a joke. The vaccines are a joke because they prevent the spread of the virus. The vaccine is a joke because it prevents the spread of the virus. They are not allowed under federal regulations.
75,21,The movie is a prank because he is a black man who lives in the country and uses his mask to stop HIV.
95,21,A prank is a joke. It is a prank. It is a joke because it is based on a joke.
21,2,"It seems like a lot of people are getting these kinds of pranks because the actual premise of the movie is to get people to not be able to take a joke because it's racist, a prank, and a prank, which you could have gotten with a joke. It's a joke because it's racist."
21,12,"""I don't know why I'm going to go to a lot of things. This whole thing is a scam."
21,16,That was a joke. This is not a joke. The president has to be the best.
21,17,A prank isn't a joke. It's a joke because the government is trying to make a joke about it and not about any of it. That's not what it is a joke about.
22,21,"Vaccination is a joke, because people will want to put on the masks, but that's a bad joke."
43,21,I’d be happy if the CDC actually did it to stop a virus from spreading and that would be a joke.
55,21,> Because they're trying to make a joke out of this
56,21,>I'm pretty sure it does work with your nose. So that’s not a problem.
58,21,The CDC doesn't think it is a joke.
66,21,I don't think they're racist. They are racist.
68,21,"I don't think this is a joke, but I think they're trying to make fun of the CDC because it's racist."
70,21,"The CDC is going to send the CDC a ""Jack"" to stop the spread of the AIDS virus. It's an issue. CDC is trying to prevent the spread of AIDS and a joke, but the president is trying to make this a joke."
72,21,The CDC is trying to put it in the hands of people. I've never heard of the CDC making a 'juke' about HIV.
75,21,CANNOTANSWER:
95,21,This is not a joke. It's a joke because a joke is made. It's just a joke.
21,2,"You just gotta go to a lot of things. I'm allergic to the smell of shit, but I do not understand that a mask helps the person that gets it."
21,12,People with allergies have to wear masks and sometimes they just don't like it.
21,16,CANNOTANSWER: This is a joke because a joke is made. It's a joke because it's not a joke.
21,17,"I am a prankster, but I do not like the fact that you imply that the government is trying to stop the spread of a virus. And it's a joke. A joke is only a joke when they make a joke. Especially because they can make the joke about you but that's not what a joke is."
22,21,A joke that isn't a joke is a joke and an extremely offensive one at that. It's a joke because the CDC and the CDC are trying to sue him for this and that's why it's called a joke.
43,21,There is a whole bunch of nonsense in this thread. Vaccination is the best way to stop the spread of the virus.
55,21,"So...the CDC want's to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS, but they don't want to protect the people infected with it. They want to protect the people who have HIV/AIDS. They want to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS."
56,21,I was taught to wear a mask by one of the CDC's insurgents.
58,21,"The article says the presidential mask will prevent the spread of a virus. They also mention the ""Pence of Perpetuity"" rule, which means that doctors need to be trained in all forms of HIV. That is not a joke."
66,21,"The CDC supposedly has a policy against the use of a mask, that is to say, not the CDC's own."
68,21,"The only real reason you'd make that a joke is because you're so blatantly ignorant, and so often are based on a blatantly racist joke. The best you can do is take a look at the article, read it, and then leave it out. You're being a jerk. If you're being a jerk, you should know what it's about."
70,21,"There are a lot of people on Reddit who would say ""I don't believe the CDC and the CDC are trying to stop the spread of AIDS. I think it's a joke."""
72,21,"If I were Trump, I'd wear a mask because that is what I would say, not because of my family."
75,21,CANNOTANSWER: That's the whole thing is a mish-mash. The whole thing is a prank.
95,21,"Is it possible that they aren’t actually allergic to the virus? If so, the people who are allergic to the virus are not being joked about."
