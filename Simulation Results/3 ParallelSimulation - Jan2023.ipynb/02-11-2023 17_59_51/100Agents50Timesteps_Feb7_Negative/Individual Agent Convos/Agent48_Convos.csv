If there's one thing they can do, that's to say it's OK not to wear them. If there isn't something you'd rather not, there's no harm in being a person.

58,48,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.Trump and Ingraham are destroying all our rights and promoting a culture where it's a common practice.
73,48,You can't help me but talk about my fear of the new rules for my team when it comes to the ACA and the NFL. That's exactly what I've gotten from my career.
75,48,You're going to die. I mean if you can't get vaccinated you shouldn't be able to take those meds in that time period.
48,23,"Its not the new rules that prevent vaccines. Its a system designed to make people have the ability to wear masks in a safe, unimpeded environment. Its just that most people don't think that it is ok not to wear masks, which is also what I'm sure the majority of people think."
48,31,...but it's still a scam.
48,32,I'm not really sure if this is something that is actually on the side of a hunch or not. The article says that the government has created a program designed to prevent the spread of a virus.

54,48,I think people are being misinformed by this. It was my team in NH that went to a lot of games and was really upset when they noticed that this was one of their goals in Canada.
56,48,This is the only thing a medical professional can tell you to wear.
58,48,"The fact that the president is actually putting on a mask is not an excuse to be out in public. The president, not himself, isn't a racist. It's not his right to prevent it, and it is not his right to protect us from the world."
73,48,It is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
75,48,"It's actually not that scary that it's a good thing this guy isn't going to work, but rather that he's going to be in a position of power to keep a guy from doing so."
48,23,It's a scam.
48,31,This guy is not in charge of preventing the spread of a virus. I think the question is whether or not the 'Microsoft' government is willing to put a lot of resources into helping vaccines.
48,32,"The thing is, I think it's time to give the new administration some time to develop a better way to deal with this problem. We need to start promoting vaccines to the players because they seem to be not good enough to deal with the virus themselves."
48,35,"What do you think about all the comments, which are based on the most recent fuck up that the author of this article has ever written? You say that he has no clue what is going on here. The first one makes absolutely no sense, since it's an article that says that the government is willing to put resources into helping vaccines. It doesn't seem like the first person that thinks so. It's basically a conspiracy theory."
48,36,"I can understand what a doctor could tell you. The CDC is not aware that people wear masks, it isn't as much a protection from HIV, or is it a policy that isn't actually against it?"
48,37,This is not really the correct answer.
48,40,Getting vaccinated is one of the dumbest things in my life and i've done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things
54,48,"It's called the ""Faceless"" and it's only a temporary word - the phrase that gets in the way is ""fake."" So it's the ad hominem of a liar (although it's not a big deal in the US) that is trying to cover for it."
56,48,This is very important. We should have a new mask as a part of our national vaccine program.
58,48,"There are many ways in which that can be applied. One is being able to wear a mask on a saturday, while another is wearing a mask on a saturday. That way you can actually tell how dangerous it is and where the virus might be infecting other people."
73,48,"People are not saying anything that makes them feel bad, the government is."
75,48,"Unless your doctor is black, you can't go anywhere without a mask. It's an illegal activity to wear a mask while sick."
48,23,It sounds like your government is trying to sabotage the virus. It's a scam and not illegal to put on a mask when you're sick.
48,31,"This is a good point, and isn't just a troll comment. It's a conspiracy theory. The guy's a racist."
48,32,We should have a new mask as a part of our national vaccine program.
48,35,You could get an ad on a local newspaper to make an informed decision.

48,40,"This is the first thing to come to my mind as you read. Is the government aware that people are being exploited as a means to keep their jobs? Are they not aware that the Obama Administration can change that to the point that it will only exacerbate a lot of the problem? Is the president still using this for the other side of the debate, though?"
54,48,"I'd suggest that the CDC are trying to keep the health care industry functioning. They're trying to make sure they don't infect everyone on the planet, not just in the US."

48,23,It's still a scam. It's the same as it is with the government (as of recently). That's why it doesn't have a requirement that people wear masks.
48,31,I think the whole thing is a scam. You have to be ready to do all of the stupid things that I've done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things.
48,32,It's a joke and it's a scam. It's a scam because it's not true.
48,35,"That's an extremely accurate ad to say, and I'd not say this is a scam, but that the article has an almost identical premise:"
48,36,"There aren't many states that allow public health services to put on masks (especially on the NHS) so it's pretty common that someone's doctor doesn't know that, he just assumes that the CDC should do that to a degree. It's not a joke. It's a joke."
48,37,"It is a joke and the CDC has no problem preventing any virus spreading there. It's one of the most dangerous things to get sick on a regular basis. Moreover, it would be the least safe thing to do in a world where you don't get to go into an infection."
48,40,I'm a CDC agent. They have the authority to act on it and they can do that. That means they have to act on it.
54,48,The CDC is not doing anything wrong. That CDC should not be in the health care industry as long as it's properly and safely in place and acted reasonably. They do not want to hurt the health care industry. They just want to make sure they do.
56,48,It's like the government will just be suing people for their sexism in a future election.
58,48,Because I am a sexist guy and it's not a great idea.

48,32,"I'm confused. Who is wearing a mask in an office, sexist, or just a joke?"
48,35,It's a scam because there's an ad that says there's an ad and is based on a nefarious conspiracy theory. I'm a doctor and I can assure you that is the premise of the article.
48,36,Weird how many people who are a lot of stupid who put on masks are going to want to get vaccinated for the new virus.
48,37,"This is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I hate to say this but the person said something like: ""We lost a mask at least four times a day.

48,40,"The article says that the CDC has no responsibility to act on the CDC's use of ""minority and minorities"" to stop people from having infections in the general population. So the CDC is supposed to be there and allow them to be in the health care industry to prevent infections as well. That's a very serious problem."
54,48,"It is the government's job to prevent the spread of HIV, it is not."
56,48,The CIA is a troll. This is why they are getting people in hot water - they're making their money from that. It doesn't matter how bad it is to a victim. The CIA is a troll. There is no obligation to make any money - they just want to do it.
58,48,Is the President a racist?
73,48,">I can tell you, we're just a very, very, very little group. We're a group. We're a group. We're a group. We can't change. I just know that we all have to learn to use my masks a bit more and get used to how they work."
75,48,"""Matherless"" is the proper term. The person is being a jerk. I think the most important point of the article is that people who have a good idea of the premise of this is being honest, but the actual problem is that people have no idea about the facts of this prank, and they are just being silly. I'm not gonna lie. This guy is a jerk. You can't read any book he wrote that is not a good example of how people can read their own personal life, and then make money off of this."

48,31,"""Scam."" is actually a bit more relevant than what I am suggesting."
48,32,"He doesn't seem to care about the health of the public. He is trying to take advantage of people like you and the people he has worked with and who have a good knowledge of all the things he did. It's just the government. It seems like the government has little incentive to try to bolster their control over people. I'm not sure if that's a good idea, but there is no way the government could stop a virus from spreading."
48,35,I read the article. They said it was a joke that the CDC is doing is to stop HIV transmission. The article also said that the CDC has no responsibility to prevent this virus from spreading.
48,36,This is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

54,48,I can't believe the CDC is getting shit together and is also trying to cut off the NSA from its activities. You could be saying the same thing about this comment.

58,48,"I'm sorry, but that's really not the reason for a mask. It's a mask. It's actually not the reason he doesn't wear one."
73,48,There is something bad about this whole virus. It's not about them. But the ACA is going to make the players more sick and the government is manipulating it.
75,48,"Vaccination is a terrible disease. If the team is vaccinated, a player can not be infected. If they are not vaccinated, you will have to wear a mask. The only way to stop it is to put on a mask. The only way to stop it is to put on a mask. I want to talk about my favorite book if you'd like to read the movie if you're interested.

48,40,The article actually states that the CDC doesn't have a role in helping the spread of the virus.
54,48,It's a joke. It's not an issue. It's a problem. It's not a problem.
56,48,Vaccination is the only cure for a virus that is not a virus.
58,48,I have a few things to offer.
73,48,"There are also more examples of people who are not immune to a virus, particularly in terms of the medical profession."
75,48,The CIA has no authority to make laws about sex or anything else. I would probably be okay with it and see if I could get a troll for this.
48,23,...that is a joke. It’s not a scam. It’s a scam. The CIA and NSA are attempting to stop this.

54,48,"I don't see why people would be upset with people not knowing about this, in part because people were unknowingly stifling an education, and then complaining that the government isn't doing anything to stop the spread of a virus."
56,48,No one knows what that means.
58,48,This is what I get when I'm watching the NSA's Vaccine rant about the military. It's funny. It's funny.
73,48,"My dad is a medical assistant and when his father was born in Houston, he would be vaccinated and get a second and third year (after I got my first) for a Virus called the Zika virus."
75,48,"I don't know, because it would be a really shite situation if someone was going to stop doing the vaccine because they thought it was a good idea. And you would be able to just reapply for vaccines."
48,23,I'm gonna get rid of that.
48,31,It's a scam. You're not being a racist.
48,32,Vaccines are an illegal means of vaccination. It is not illegal to have them.

48,36,The CIA and NSA are attempting to stop this.
48,37,"CDC has no problem preventing any virus spreading there. It's one of the most dangerous things to get sick on a regular basis. Moreover, it would be the least safe thing to do in a world where you don't get to go into an infection."
48,40,I don't think the government is concerned about people getting vaccinated and just taking it off. They're being exploited.
54,48,"A person who doesn't get the vaccine is a liar. That's a lie. And that's the whole point of the entire piece, except the fact that it's about the government in general, not just the administration."
56,48,"The Obama administration uses this idiom as a pretext to justify all of its actions, and by definition this is not a rebuttal. Vaccination is the only cure for a virus that is not a virus."

73,48,That is the joke. The ACA isn't a joke. It's a joke because people have no reason to be on the receiving end of the problem. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of a virus.
75,48,There is some interesting details besides the CIA and the anti-smoking community. Basically I think you should read this for a day or two.

48,35,The article's title is just that: 'Possession is a joke. The guy who lied to me was a racist. We should have a new mask as a part of our national vaccine program.'
48,36,This is the same people who were racist and lied to you.

I've had to put on a mask for a lot of times now because of how many people that I've had to scream that I'm an amazing coach (I would say I'm, huh, a bitch!)

73,48,No. You are going to have to go.
75,48,I'd say that's a good deal of evidence to imply that the CDC would be able to help prevent this from happening. And it's probably a little unfair to think that people would take a lot of this advice.
48,23,This isn't about the CDC's stance on AIDS. It's about the CDC's stance against it.
48,31,"That's a great joke. It's also a good way to get the HIV vaccine in a safer place. It's going to take more than a few months and it's going to get harder, it's going to get harder, it's going to get harder, and it's going to get harder."
48,32,No one is getting a good laugh out of this.
48,35,And then I read the whole thing.

56,48,It's also a hysterical joke that doesn't even know how to write a joke. It's literally a word that says you have a job and you don't have a job. You do not get a job because you don't have a job. It's an excuse for you to be a terrible man.

48,40,That's the article OP's addressing. This has been on this thread for months and every article on here is absolutely crap. I don't want to be able to summarize that in a broader context.
54,48,">(Amatheamus is a joke, but he probably means that the joke was made in an attempt to discourage people from being infected with the virus."

58,48,"The CDC is working on a smear campaign. If he doesn't want to work, then the President and his campaign team will either get in a hot seat and vote for the president or start their own."
73,48,"This is one of those situations where you need to know how to work out what is being discussed. If the ACA wasn't to be followed closely you could have become a jack. You could be a bad person for it. However I do know it's a joke. I know the fact that the ACA is going to keep people sick is enough to prevent the spread of the Zika virus. So, you're going to need to get a vaccine."
75,48,"Vaccination is a terrible disease. If the government were preventing it, they wouldn't have done anything to stop it from spreading. If the government were preventing it from spreading, they wouldn't have done anything to stop it from spreading. The CIA and NSA are suing him for fraud. They don't really have much of a case to answer."
48,23,"I stayed at home with a friend once when I was in my late 20s who was vaccinated for Zika (a virus that you can be transmitted to other people by eating, drinking, etc), so I knew that while the CDC had been trying to stop it from spreading and the CDC was trying to stop it from spreading, it was the CDC who took advantage of the CDC and the NSA."
48,31,"It's a joke, but not a joke. Vaccination is an illegal means of vaccination. It's a shithole and there's no reason why this isn't going to happen. CDC and NSA are trying to prevent the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
48,32,"...and to end, the President is going to need to get a vaccine and continue being a hoot."
48,35,"You know, because this isn't an interesting ad."
48,36,Vaccination is a joke and is not a good thing. It is a joke because the CDC and NSA are trying to stop the spread of a virus.

73,48,"CANNOTANSWER: I’m not in this thread, I’m not in a position to know what a joke is. I was a coach at a baseball stadium. I’ve been in the media for about a year, and my team got all kinds of comments about this, and I just wanted to let it out there."
75,48,The post was probably more a joke than a legitimate one. The post title was more about the story that prompted the article to come to light.
48,23,I am not a racist.
48,31,"Well, it doesn't sound like a great joke, is it?"
48,32,Vaccination is a joke. Vaccination is a joke. Vaccination is a joke. Vaccination is a joke. Vaccination is a joke. Vaccination is a joke.
48,35,"No wonder this is an ad for this one. This is not a joke, but this is what happens when you take away something."
48,36,You can’t just put on a mask when you’re infected. That’s what a joke is.

54,48,"In my opinion, it doesn't seem a joke. I think it's a joke. It's the only thing they need to do to stop this disease. It's a joke. You can't keep an eye on it unless you get caught. But you can also get infected with it if you get infected."
56,48,CANNOTANSWER: I don't think this is a joke.
58,48,I'm referring to the fact that there is a difference between a CDC and a CDC's smear campaign. One is an ad for a vaccine and the other is an ad for a smear campaign.
73,48,"Vaccination is a joke and it doesn't make anyone sick. The idea that it's a joke is laughable, but the government isn't going to get the ACA to come out as a joke."
75,48,I'd say I'm being a troll. I don't understand why the article is being posted.
48,23,This is just as big of a joke as the article is about. There's a difference in what's not a joke.
48,31,That's actually the most harrowing article I've ever read on this site.
48,32,The president of the United States is trying to smear the government with a smear campaign. The President has a choice.
48,35,Are you aware that there is a new CDC vaccine campaign going on?
48,36,I would not say it's a joke. I'd say that it's not a joke. The only thing they need to do is prevent the spread of a virus.
48,37,"Is there any way the article is going to be accurate? If so, then it seems pretty unlikely that it would work if this article is the one of the most believable stories that can be told by an outsider."
48,40,"I'm not sure if that's the correct term for the joke that was being used. But, I was just using the euphemism."
54,48,I'm a huge democrat and a troll.
56,48,It's the only cure for a virus that is not a virus.
58,48,"I'm not sure I'm being honest, but in an article you mention that the president is trying to stop the spread of the virus. He's saying ""the government wants to stop the spread of the virus."" He's making a joke about it, and isn't trying to stop the spread. He's trying to stop the spread of the virus. The truth is that vaccine is a good way to prevent the spread of HIV. The article explains that he was not infected and was being vaccinated. The CDC's smear campaigning"
73,48,I have a few words for this:
75,48,"I'm not saying you're not being a jerk, I'm saying people are more open to making a joke than a joke."
48,23,"“If you think that putting on a mask when you're sick is one of the dumbest things things I've ever done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things. The only thing I can think of is that I am a doctor. I’ve done the same. I’ve done the same. I’ve only been sick for 7 years, and I’ve never had a problem with it.”"
48,31,"As soon as the article comes out, I'll say it's pretty good. I just want to say that I think it's a good joke. I think it's a good joke but not a good joke."
48,32,"It's like if the president can't get the CDC to stop, and that's why they're trying to start a government campaign against the government."
48,35,The whole thing is a scam. The CDC is not a part of the CDC. They are putting people in a danger zone. There is a huge difference between a CDC and a CDC vaccine campaign.
48,36,The article clearly states that the CDC is attempting to prevent the spread of AIDS.
48,37,>The CDC and the NSA are trying to stop the spread of AIDS. The fact that people like this are being so deluded about the disease doesn't make any sense.
48,40,I don't see how the guy is still using the joke he was talking about. I'm not sure what the joke is.
54,48,I can't believe the CDC is trying to cut off the NSA from its activities.
56,48,Vaccination is the only cure for a virus that is not a virus.
58,48,The fact that the CDC is trying to stop the spread of HIV.
73,48,I have a bad day today!
75,48,It’s an euphemism. I don’t know.
48,23,"He’s actually the guy that just said, “We don’t have mandatory masks in DC, but we have to make them mandatory to get the vaccine and not the government."
48,31,It's a joke.
48,32,The article cites some of the jokes in the article.
48,35,"Vaccination is a joke because CDC is being abused by the CIA and AIDS is the same thing they are saying ""it's illegal to prevent sex from spreading."""
48,36,"As soon as the article comes out, I’ll say it’s pretty good. I just want to say that I think it’s a good joke. I think it’s a joke because the CDC and the NSA are trying to stop the spread of AIDS. The fact that the CDC and the NSA are trying to stop the spread of AIDS. The fact that the CDC is trying to cut off the NSA from its activities. Vaccination is the only cure for a virus that is not a virus."
48,37,There is not a joke about having to do some kind of medical emergency for people who are sick or in need.
48,40,"Is it the presidents, abolitionists or any other party that has already committed to using'masks and masks to protect people' from the disease? I think this is the government's job to stop a disease and if we want to stop it we can cut them off and use the CDC, because the CDC is trying to'stop the spread of AIDS. The CDC is not a prank, they are trying to prevent it's spread, it's a joke."
54,48,"CDC is putting in effort to eliminate the possibility of the spread of AIDS in the US, not to mention the CDC is doing it."
56,48,I'm not a lawyer. I am not a lawyer.
58,48,"As a Republican, I'm very concerned about the potential insanity in the CDC and the CDC."
73,48,I like to make fun of my fellow athletes. They're not on the same page. :(
75,48,I don't see the issue of the CIA suing him for anything other than making fun of him for having no knowledge of AIDS.
48,23,It's not that they're trying to stop it. They're just trying to try to stop it.
48,31,"So, it looks like a ridiculous joke, but not a funny one."
48,32,That is a fucking crock.
48,35,"I've had a lot of people say this when they are talking about a bill to cut off the CDC and that they should be allowed to protect people from getting HIV and that is basically saying that unless the government doesn't have a role in stopping HIV, sex is a joke and the CDC needs to have the government do something about it."
48,36,The CDC and the NSA are trying to stop the spread of AIDS.
48,37,What's going on here?
48,40,"A lot of people are arguing the problem is with the government, not the health care system. They say, ""If you don't mind telling the CIA and NSA it's illegal to prevent sex from spreading, they aren't trying to stop it. Vaccination is the only cure for a virus that is not a virus."" ("
54,48,Why are there so many other pranks that the CIA is not doing anything about?
56,48,I want to make sure that every fucking NSA operative I know has the correct form of the virus is also infected.
58,48,"In the United States, wearing a mask on a saturday is the equivalent of wearing a white shirt and being vaccinated."
73,48,"Vaccination isn't a joke. It's a joke because the government doesn't want to prevent any future cases of Zika. The ACA is being abused. The truth is that the ACA isn't a joke. The only thing they want is the ACA removed, because they don't want to stop them from doing it."
75,48,"I think that the entire premise of this is a joke and the whole thing is a mish-mash. The article is about the government using an ""illegal method"" of preventing AIDS. They are using it to try and stop AIDS in some way, and they are using that technique to try and make this a joke."
48,23,What do you think of these sluts?
48,31,"This is so sick. I had a few questions and I couldn't help but think of it as ""serious"" and ""against the truth"" and not ""I think it's a joke, but not a funny one."""
48,32,The CDC and CDC should not be suing the CDC. It's basically trying to stop a virus from spreading.
48,35,"> Vaccination is a joke because the CDC is being abused by the CIA and AIDS is the same thing they are saying ""it's illegal to prevent sex from spreading""."
48,36,I'm sorry to hear that but I still hate a lot of the CDC and the NSA and I am so upset at the government trying to kill the virus and stop the spread of the disease.
48,37,"It is not a joke, it is a joke that is intended to stoke the health debate on a level that can be determined."
48,40,"If a doctor believes an outbreak can be prevented, they can recommend that the patient have an oral antiseptic that has been proven to be safe for many."
54,48,"Vaccines are a joke. It's a joke. The CDC doesn't have the mandate to make vaccines available to the masses. There isn't a CDC in the US, yet the federal government is trying to defund it."
56,48,"CANNOTANSWER: I don't think this is a joke. It's the hysterical joke that exists because it is so common. It’s not about your petty self, it’s about your self-esteem. I'm not sure what that means."
58,48,"It's just a joke, it's just a joke."
73,48,I haven't actually read the article yet.
75,48,"""Vaccination is not a terrible disease. If the CIA and NSA were preventing sex, they wouldn't have done anything to stop it from spreading."""
48,23,"There's a bit of a difference here between ""dumb and dumb"" and ""really stupid."""
48,31,Well if they're not willing to help with this - it's only a prank - it's not a joke.
48,32,I don't think the president is getting a good laugh out of this.
48,35,"Vaccination is a joke because the government is being abused by the CIA and AIDS is the same thing they are saying ""it's illegal to prevent sex from spreading."""
48,36,The CDC is trying to protect against a virus.
48,37,Vaccination is a joke because it aims to stop the spread of the disease.
48,40,"The joke was actually part of the effort to stop the spread of the virus.It's not a joke, but it's a joke."
54,48,'TwitchCon and masks are part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. The title does not make sense.
56,48,"I mean it's one of the most important jobs in the country, it's the biggest job to do - to be a doctor. Having a job means you're better than your family or friends and you're just as much worth as a doctor."
58,48,This is pretty clear in the title:
73,48,"Vaccination isn't a joke, a joke, a joke, a joke."
75,48,"I’m glad this is a genuine question, not just about what they have said."
48,23,So what is your point that the article is misleading? It doesn't say that the CDC has any problem preventing AIDS.
48,31,"It's a joke. They are trying to protect the public, not a joke. Vaccination is a joke. It is a joke, but it's a joke."
48,32,"Vaccination is a joke, a hysterical joke. Vaccination is a joke. It is a joke because it's meant to stop the spread of a virus."
48,35,So CDC is the person who is the joke of the day?
48,36,"It's a joke. The CDC is trying to stop the spread of AIDS, and they want to make sure that the patients won't get sick."
48,37,The CDC is trying to stop the spread of AIDS. Vaccines are a joke.
48,40,It is not a joke. It is a joke because it is in the act of protecting people.

48,23,People use this as a way to justify the CDC's stance on AIDS. It's a joke because it's illegal to put on a mask when someone's sick and it's a legitimate way to do so. Vaccines and vaccines are illegal because of their role in stopping it.
