70,10,This shit's not so good as it isn't so good as it isn't a scam.
70,12,It's funny because the people who are trying to get them to wear masks are assuming that the people who are trying to infect other people don't have the same immunity as them and have the same problems that the government is trying to create.

I don't know if it works, but I do use it a lot and they do this all the time, especially when I'm having a really bad bout of a cold and I have to work all day. I just lose my mask every day.

70,19,"Is a mask as common as a t shirt? Yes, but people who wear it are more likely to see the word ""smoke"" in the headline."
70,21,"Despite the fact that the CDC's goal is to have a full blown vaccine that could prevent a lot of the spread of a virus, there's just no way of knowing if it's even real or not, since most of the current vaccines aren't proven to work."
70,22,"I believe a lot of the comments are a bunch of things that would be useful to people who are sick or need treatment to stop their symptoms. You’d have a lot of good shit to say, you have a lot of bad shit to say."

70,29,"In your country, a mask is required to stop people from flying through the country."
70,30,I'd say a real one is a mask. I wore it after my balding face and after I lost it I'd say no.
70,32,People don't care to be a scam when it comes to things they've done. They want to do what they want without being a scam.
70,33,"I've had a few friends who were putting on a mask and I was getting really angry when I got them out of the way. I'm a little apprehensive as well, but I don't think it's the ""right"" thing to do. It's the ""right"" thing to do. The way it's being said is not necessarily the right thing to do."
70,34,I'm not sure how much I could agree with you. A mask isn't like a real mask. A mask has no place in the human body.
70,36,"They say that as an excuse to leave it out for the rest of the country, and that it's better not to use the term that it's used for."
70,40,"A guy who lost a mask in 2008 a few months ago, who also lost his wife's, has a piece of paper about how his daughter's mask was leaking. She's not a doctor, and it's probably because she got an infection when she was 16 months pregnant, and she's just putting it on herself to prevent her to live in the same spot."
70,43,"> ""The White House is very good at letting people be who they want, without making a bad impression."
70,50,"In this context, it might be a little confusing. We are talking about putting on a mask. It's really an idea, but it's a good idea. It's a mask and it's very nice. Then you can wear a similar kind of mask on your face with your dick if you're feeling good. Then you can say, ""hey, I wore a mask at the beginning and you got a nice big face! I don't know what you're talking about, but I'm also gonna say,"
70,51,"I'm going to tell you, the whole issue is with the NSA a lot."
70,54,"[NAME] was trying to say that the “Faceless” is only a temporary word, and that this is a scam because the “Faceless” has been a problem for the last few years and is now part of the program. She says she wants to have people who have no problems wearing a mask. She says the word is too'smoking’ because that is what she would say if she had been told not to wear it."
70,56,"This is one of those things where it isn't very helpful at all. This isn't a joke, it's a remark. I think it should be. If they don't keep trying, then the problem isn't the mask itself. The reason is, I have a scar on my face and a bad feeling and it works ok."
70,63,"I think the real story is that in 2009, the president decided not to wear a mask. They made it so that people could see he was infected and if they didn't, the president would retaliate and use it to spread a virus. In this case, he had to wear a mask that was a lot more effective to spread a virus."
70,69,I can't believe the amount of people who don't wear their masks unless it's for an interview.
71,70,I like the way you think.
72,70,This is not what the CDC is trying to do. It is a joke. They're not trying to be more helpful. They want the public to know what the vaccine is.
90,70,...And the fact that a billion people live in the US doesn't make me think that I'm right.
91,70,I'm in Canada and I have never had a vaccinated person come to my work for the first time. When I tried to do that I went on my phone and saw a TV with me. I ended up getting a fever from it.
100,70,You don't have the right to have a political viewpoint.
70,8,There is not much I can give you here.
70,10,"A lot of people who aren't vaccinated don't have a right to say ""I lost a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam. I don't think they really care about a joke about this or the way it is being used."

70,19,"I'm not sure how to read the comments. But I do think putting on a mask is good, but I'm not sure why it's a scam."
70,21,"There's the ""Faceless"" acronym, a word that 'can be used as a cover for different types of virus. It's a way of saying ""i've never worn a mask."" If someone says they're going to go out and smoke, I'd get it fixed. If someone said they were going to go out and smoke, I'd get it fixed. It's an easy way to find someone else."

70,32,"They should always have someone wearing a mask to protect them from the viruses causing them to spread, it's a shame, because it is completely useless to any government agency."
70,33,"I mean, the problem here isn't that the mask isn't a virus. It's that it's not an effective way of controlling the spread of a virus. The problem is the mask."
70,34,"> I think the real story is that in 2009, the president decided not to wear a mask. They made it so that people could see he was infected and if they didn't, the president would retaliate and use it to spread a virus."
70,36,That CDC has been trying to make an argument for people not wearing masks for years because they have a lot of problems with viruses.
70,40,"""I wear a mask on my face and it seems to work."""
70,43,"Well there's only one exception, the fact that people wear masks is the most likely explanation of the problem."
70,50,>Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
70,51,"I'm sorry but I feel very uncomfortable about the way people feel about how people seem to be wearing their masks. This is a big issue, but a big one. It seems to me like there is nothing really good about wearing a mask."
70,54,">I'm not a very big fan of the Bush Administration, but I am going to have to be more clear on what is happening, because that's what we are doing."""
70,56,"I think the joke was a bit confusing at first, but in general people would consider it a good thing to wear a mask, because that mask has no place in the body."
70,63,You can't have a joke without talking about the right thing. I can't even imagine how many people would respond if I told you otherwise. I can't imagine how many people are able to tell who the NSA is or what the government is doing. This is just some common misunderstandings of the CDC.
70,69,I can't think of a single person with a bad reaction to this. Clearly I don't get it. It sounds like the president does. It's not as if the NSA has a problem with what they do with this stuff.
71,70,"I am a smoker and a really bad one, and my mask is the shit. I can barely breathe in a cigarette without it because I am allergic to tobacco."
72,70,"It would be a great thing if they were all talking about that, they just couldn't see where it'd go. It's like saying ""why are you in the hivemind?"" when it comes to a health issue. It's a good thing it's not a joke. The fact that you're saying it's a scam is a huge deal. It's a waste of resources to make a blunder."
90,70,I had to read all of this because I was getting nervous about going into public...
91,70,Vaccination is an essential part of protecting against any disease.
100,70,"[Missing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus....and in a racist way that actually has a political message? I'm sorry, but you're on the right track to your life. This is one of those people who seems like they've got too much power to be involved in anything. This is why we don't have the right to keep out of the house. The federal government is the real problem. The Obama campaign has really been doing a good job of keeping"
70,8,">I think the real story is that in 2009, the president decided not to wear a mask. They made it so that people could see he was infected and if they didn't, the president would retaliate and use it to spread a virus."
70,10,That is why they're still putting these shit on. There is a reason the CDC's policies are putting shit on people who aren't vaccinated - it's not because the people don't care or the way it is being used - it's because the problem with this is that people aren't being vaccinated to prevent the spread of the viruses.
70,12,"The government is the problem, not you. The CDC is the problem."

70,25,There are a lot of jokes on reddit that can be used in context.
70,27,"There is a lot of conflict between this and ""I lost a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam. ""."
70,29,"And the problem with a mask is that people are sick and have an infection of some kind, not what's actually being used to fight off the virus. So I think it is kind of ridiculous for people to wear masks to fend off their illnesses in order to stop a virus from spreading."
70,30,The whole thing is a scam.
70,32,It sounds like the president has a problem with how people are treating people.
70,33,It is not a joke. It is a joke. It is a joke.
70,34,"I'm a really bad smoker and a smoker hasn't smoked any cigars since I was five. My dad smoked a lot of cigars. He said ""I would just smoke more in general,"" but he still does."

70,51,"The NSA needs to be able to effectively rip a person off if it has any 'effects' and prevent anyone else from getting the virus. And it's not a big deal that they're doing, they're not doing it right."
70,54,"Yes, I'm a big fan of the Bush administration. I have never heard it referred to. But it sounds like you're really trying to make a joke about a blunder:"
70,56,"I'd be in a lot of trouble for not wanting to wear a mask, but it's a good idea to be wearing one. I think people can be more comfortable with their masks and they're more likely to wear something that may not be a good one to prevent or control the spread of a virus."

90,70,>It seems to me that the only thing that people need to do is to wear a mask. Its not that you have a right to live your lives and will die from the virus if they don't wear a mask.
91,70,I'm going to tell you something.
100,70,The hunch is that he isn't the president of this country.
70,8,That is a prank. It is the prank.
70,10,He's just a fucking joke. He's a huge fan of the Bush administration. I am a big fan of him. I've been a big fan of the Bush administration. I have never heard it referred to.

70,25,"""I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam."""
70,27,It sounds like the president has a problem with how people are treating people. It is not a joke. It is a joke.
70,29,The virus is very prevalent and it's very clear to everyone that it's the virus. Vaccination is essential to stop any epidemic in the world.
70,30,"This is a legitimate, unbiased question, and is the basis for many a political conspiracy. It is a lie that I would be a little embarrassed to answer."
70,32,The problem is that people cannot be completely silent - their entire body is already infected.

70,34,>I think it is kind of ridiculous for people to wear a mask to fend off their illnesses in order to stop a virus.
70,36,"I don't like the word that you use, but I do like the phrase ""smokeless"" - it irritates me. The CDC's stance is that they're trying to use the word as an excuse to leave it out for the rest of the country."
70,40,"I'm an American with an American mother, and I was told the same things by a friend who was the president of the US."
70,43,Is that what you are trying to say?
70,50,"My parents tried wearing a mask when I was younger. But I can't stand the idea of them not wearing a mask and getting sick. Basically, you just wear a mask on your head because you can see that you are sick."
70,51,"CANNOTANSWER: It sounds like the President has a problem with what the NSA is doing with this stuff. I've tried wearing a mask before, but it doesn't work. I'm pretty sure it does work with your nose."

70,56,"CANNOTANSWER: It sounds like the President has a problem with what the NSA is doing with this stuff. I've tried wearing a mask before, but it doesn't work. I'm pretty sure it does work with your nose. So that's not a problem."
70,63,I know what I'm talking about. But the president is clearly not the President of this country.
70,69,I'd be in trouble for not wanting to wear a mask.
71,70,"A mask has nothing to do with the virus. It's the first thing that I've seen when I was in high school to wear a mask and see how it's helping people with their apnea, and now I have a mask with me because of the smell of smoke. It makes me think it's going to stop it spreading."
72,70,"It's a scam to be sure, but it's a scam to believe someone is saying what they're talking about."

70,12,">You don't need a mask, but they do need the proper hood and other protective clothing so that you can get away from them."
70,19,"It's not funny at all to ask people to wear a mask every day because they're sick, and you're not the person who has to use it to stop the spread of a disease."
70,21,This is like the whole fucking NSA's job.
70,22,"I don't know where you're getting your hat, but this is about people hating the government in order to keep people from dying of the virus."

70,27,"Is this a genuine question? Because in the US people can be as sick as they want. In the US people can have the virus, but in the world that virus is far worse than the human race."
70,29,A CDC official apologises but still takes a joke.
70,30,I would be in trouble if I lost a mask.
70,32,So how is the person who's a good athlete wearing a mask?
70,33,"I don't think I've ever seen a joke like that about wearing a mask and that I'm very happy about it. I'm really excited to see it on TV, but when it's true the truth reaches me!"" ('I like your style of joke - if you just don't know that we have to wear a mask you're going to want to hear that again.')"
70,34,"I can tell you that it's the problem, and if you ever try to tell me the truth it may be a lie. And you probably don't know it. I'm not saying you have to go to work with a mask, but it works."
70,36,Isn't there any point to getting the point across by putting words in my mouth about people not wearing masks? It's pretty obvious.
70,40,Vaccination is essential to stop any epidemic in the world.
70,43,I have a couple of friends who live here. One of them wears a mask. She's so sick with a cold that she doesn't even know she can take them out.
70,50,"You are the only one to ask yourself, does a mask sound familiar to you?"
70,51,"The idea of wearing a mask is that you have to keep your nose from touching your face, and that the doctor will work with you to put it on."
70,54,"CANNOTANSWER: ""...I think it is kind of ridiculous for people to wear a mask to fend off their illnesses in order to stop a virus."

71,70,"The problem is that people think it's a joke. If it were, it would be a good thing that someone would stop using masks to protect themselves."
72,70,I'm not saying a person should wear a mask. I'm just saying that the reason the CDC is trying to prevent it is that people aren't allowed to be in public and they have done some pretty stupid stupid things. And I'm just saying that's all it is.
90,70,"There are a number of people who are being treated with ""prohibition"". I think they are being targeted because of that. You are trying to discredit the media as a whole."
91,70,"If the government actually cares, they would want to know what the people who are doing it for are claiming. This is exactly what he is doing. Hopefully, the people who are promoting the idea would be happy to hear it."
100,70,I am a man of many emotions. This is what my children do when they are in their mid-20s.
70,8,I think the only real reason to stop wearing a mask is because of the government's attempt to spread a virus.
70,10,"The idea of wearing a mask is that you have to keep your nose from touching your face, and that the doctor will work with you to put it on.

70,21,""" CANNOTANSWER is a fan of the Bush Administration. The problem is that people think it's ridiculous for people to wear a mask to fend off their illnesses in order to stop a virus."

70,27,"I'm not sure what this is about. The first is a joke, and the second is about the President."
70,29,It isn't like they have to go to the doctors for them to make a joke.
70,30,"I lost a mask in public once in my life. It was a joke and I was always scared when I lost a mask. I would go to work with it to try and make it feel better, but because of a mask and the lack of training I was sick and worried."
70,32,The CDC is not the president of this country and in fact he is the one trying to discredit a public health program he is trying to sabotage.
70,33,I don't know how the joke came about wearing a mask. I think that's the joke.
70,34,"""I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam. I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam. I have been wearing a mask for three days after going to work and it was so terrible."""
70,36,"I'm saying it's ridiculous for people to wear a mask, but it's really stupid to think that people would consider it a joke. I think the issue is more that people just equate it to being a joke because they can't stop a virus."
70,40,I'm not saying a mask is an essential part of protecting against any disease.
70,43,"""The White House is very good at letting people be who they want, without making a bad impression."""
70,50,I have a friend who wears a mask but she is very sick and I don't want to lose her so she doesn't wear a mask at all. We need to get her to go to the doctor and let her in and give her a mask if needed.
70,51,"This is a lot of people's first thoughts, I am sure. But in reality, you're talking about the virus in a different light."
70,54,"He is referencing a number of CDC actions that went down for years. There are also several people who are getting treatment for virus as well, including some people who are also getting treatment."
70,56,"I believe the CDC has already decided that wearing a mask in public is an unsafe way of preventing disease, but that does not mean it is illegal."
70,63,If the CDC had never retaliated it would've just been a joke and everyone would've believed it.
70,69,"""...I think it is kind of ridiculous for people to wear a mask to fend off their illnesses in order to stop a virus."
71,70,I just have to have a drink and have a cigarette while I smoke. I have to use it when I want to wear it. I can't stand it in my pocket.
72,70,"I grew up in a very conservative area, but when I had my first vaccination I was probably not vaccinated. But then the vaccines came and I didn't. I was in a very restrictive area. The NSA, CIA, CIA are compelled to stop any 'harrassment' they are doing against the laws of the US."

100,70,>I feel like I'm in the wrong.
70,8,"My favorite part is when it says, ""We should be ashamed of the fact that we can't do any of this."""
70,10,I think this is a really good way to tell what the president said.
70,12,It's a joke because a lot of people in the US are infected with a virus. I'm not sure why people will believe a joke is a joke unless they get infected with a virus.
70,19,I would be embarrassed if I was a white guy. I'd be embarrassed if I got infected with the virus.
70,21,It's a joke.
70,22,"I think it's also one of the problems that the NSA, CIA, CIA are doing, that I haven't even heard. It's a common misconception that the government doesn't even realize that the public health system isn't really in control of the country."

70,32,"I know you know this, but there are actually a few good things that can happen."
70,33,The point is that we are not talking about an obvious infection. We're talking about a virus.
70,34,I have a buddy who wears a mask in public and he can't stand it in the pocket because he's sick. I'm sure it's a joke.
70,36,The CDC is trying to make a joke of using a name in their name because it is a joke.
70,40,"I think it is a joke, but I think a lot of people are being very negative here. It doesn't sound like there is anything wrong with a mask, ie that you're fucking stupid."
70,43,I'm not sure what this is about.
70,50,It's not so much that wearing a mask is a joke as it is that it's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. It's more that the CDC is trying to discredit a public health program that he's trying to sabotage.
70,51,"...I'm just talking about the amount of people a government official doesn't care about, because they're saying they think it's a joke."

90,70,"It's kind of sad, actually, that this idea seems so far beyond the realm of a logical explanation that it makes sense to me."
91,70,There are two things: a
100,70,"I'm a black American who lives in my hometown. My parents will come to work for me every week, and I have a mask."
70,8,This isn't a joke. This is a scam.
70,10,> Is it really a logical explanation that it makes sense to me.
70,12,I think the problem with this idea is that people are going to think it is a joke.
70,19,I just read some other posts that mention people wanting to wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus.
70,21,"What I would say is, ""Faceless"" is a good way to get people to think about how it might affect them, and how they would respond when people say, ""I know you're sick, but I'm going to make the joke about it, I don't know you're sick."""
70,22,"It's really the opposite of ""smokeless,"" or a joke."
70,25,I believe a CDC report that is being published by the US Congress on November 1st shows that a CDC report is being gathered by the CDC.
70,27,Well I was thinking the same thing as the president. He was wearing a mask and was being nice about it.
70,29,"I think you might be right, because there are certain facts here:"
70,30,That's very reasonable. A lot of people wear masks because of the danger they pose. But I think it would be much more appropriate for them to get a t-shirt and an outfit on while there.
70,32,"This isn't a joke, this is a problem. That's why we put it in public TV."
70,33,I feel like this is pretty obvious because there is a problem with the fact that the CDC has done little to help prevent and stop the spread of the virus.
70,34,"This is the one CDC program that they were doing, I think the CDC could do a lot better."
70,36,It is a joke that is just a joke. I believe that the President is the President. Is this a joke or a joke.
70,40,A lot of Americans think that a mask is useful and is necessary to prevent spread of the virus. People believe that you're an idiot for wearing a mask while you're sick.
70,43,Its just a fake. Its just a fake. Its just a fake that is designed to stop the spread of a virus.
70,50,I'm just trying to tell you that you've been taking the right path in this article.
70,51,...The fact that you're in a position to prevent people from getting infected by wearing a mask isn't a big deal.
70,54,This is a common misunderstanding of the notion that people use masks to make a joke.
70,56,... I'm a racist. I don't get it. I'm a racist.
70,63,"I would imagine that the first thing the president would do was say that the president should not wear a mask to stop the spread of the virus. And then just say, ""You know what I'm talking about. But the president is clearly not the President of this country."""
70,69,"I think a lot of Americans are coming to the realization that this was just an idea, and I'm genuinely disappointed."
71,70,"If you're a fake that's all you get out of the whole thing, I'm sure there's an explanation for why this isn't a joke."
72,70,"The article suggests that the CDC has the authority to enforce vaccine laws, because it's not a legitimate issue."
90,70,This is not a joke. It's not a joke. You are being a troll.
91,70,Vaccination is a joke.
100,70,"Its a joke, a joke."
70,8,"I don't know if this is a joke, but the Obama Administration has the authority to enforce vaccine laws. It's a joke, a joke."
70,10,"A lot of people don't have a right to wear a mask because it can cause the spread of diseases. It's a joke, a joke."
70,12,"Vaccination is a joke, a joke."
70,19,I don’t see the issue here.
70,21,"I believe the CDC is the one that's taking over the nation in protecting them from the spread of the virus. The CDC is a powerful organization that wants to create and promote more awareness of what happens when you are sick. Besides, I don't really think you can be a racist or racist to have such a serious issue."
70,22,I don't think that the only thing that comes to mind is a ridiculously ridiculous joke. But I think that's what we're talking about. Vaccination is not a joke.
70,25,Its a joke. I know. I'm not an idiot.
70,27,"""...Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
70,29,"Vaccination is a joke, a joke, a joke."

70,32,"...[That's a joke, a joke]."
70,33,The CDC is not responsible for preventing the spread of the virus.
70,34,It's the CDC's job to stop the spread of a virus and to stop him from getting infected by a mask.
70,36,It's a joke that is trying to get it out.
70,40,It's an incredibly interesting idea. The president said it's the President of the United States and didn't get much publicity for it. I've seen people get away with it.
70,43,I can’t imagine how people would take a joke like this and call it a joke.
70,50,The Obama administration is not the only one that is trying to sabotage the president.
70,51,CANNOTANSWER:
70,54,What was the article referring to?
70,56,I don't get why you don't think it's a joke. But I think it's a joke. A funny joke.
70,63,"In 2009, the president decided not to wear a mask because he felt they were a way of getting people to be aware of the disease. But then he decided to wear one because the virus spreads. So he lost a mask. And then just said, ""If the CDC had never retaliated, it would've just been a joke and everyone would've believed it."""
70,69,"It's a joke, not a joke."

I can't imagine if it would work for so long as I was a smoker."", ""I like the way you think.', ""I am a really bad one, and my mask is the shit."", ""I like the sex joke. I am a really bad one, and my mask is the shit."", ""I like the sex joke. My cigarette"
72,70,"oh no. i'm not trying to be a liar but if you put on the mask in your mouth, you'll get sick quicker."
90,70,You're probably being a troll because you just can't figure out what a nutjob is.
91,70,"The US government doesn't want to have to take the vaccines when there's no vaccinating people, and when there's no vaccine, they have to stop it unless they want to, and there is nothing to stop them from taking the vaccines. If someone wanted to take it, they should not have to take it."
100,70,"OP, who says you're not a racist?"
70,8,"The President is not the only one. He wants to be more effective, and he wants to stay in touch with the people who aren't already there, rather than getting in the way of a new craze. Then, they have to do their job."
70,10,he doesn't even have to wear a mask because it's a joke
70,12,Is it a joke to troll the CDC that everyone thinks it's a joke?
70,19,"In 2009, the president decided not to wear a mask because he felt they were a way of getting people to be aware of the virus. But then he decided to wear one because the virus spread. So he lost a mask. And then just said, ""I know that's not a joke, but that's not how it works. And it's not funny at all to ask people to wear a mask every day because they're sick, and you're not the person who has to use it to stop the virus spread."
70,21,"That isn't the whole point of this, it is the basic point of the CDC and the Obama administration, to prevent an epidemic - to do it in a way that is less harmful. Those people may not think of themselves as racist or racist, but they may think the joke is a joke."
70,22,"And the president does have to be vaccinated. It's like saying ""we've got two fucking presidents who aren't all the way from our house."" It's funny."
70,25,"OP, who says you're not a racist?"
70,27,"I know people who would like to go out with their pets and get infected with this virus. They don't like it, they don't want it to spread, they don't want it to spread. They want it to spread."
70,29,"""Vaccination is important and an important tool in stopping the spread of the disease. The administration is trying to sabotage the president. I don't see why the Obama administration should try and sabotage the president."""
70,30,So he wore a mask to protect people who don't have a virus and are more likely to get infected by it than he did after he lost a mask?
70,32,CANNOTANSWER: It's an incredibly interesting idea. The president decided not to wear a mask because he felt they were a way of getting people to be aware of the disease. But then he decided to wear one because the virus spreads. I think it is kind of ridiculous for people to wear a mask to fend off their illnesses in order to stop a virus. The President said it's the President of the United States and didn't get much publicity for it. It's an incredibly interesting idea.
70,33,Isn't it a joke that the people who are using it are really scared that the CDC would become too stupid? Apparently the idea of wearing a mask isn't being used and that the people putting on it aren't being made aware of the virus. It's not a joke.
70,34,"I want to say that, for the first time :"
70,36,I'm really sorry for the misunderstanding you're having here.
70,40,The president was clearly trying to sabotage the Obama administration with this joke. It wasn't even the joke itself.
70,43,This gimmick is an incredibly interesting concept. What the president is doing is not a joke. This isn't the kind of thing you can put out with an axe.
70,50,I've lost my mask more than four times a day. I also lost my helmet because it looks stupid.
70,51,"I'm not sure if you've heard of the joke, but a lot of people think it's a joke."
70,54,"It's a joke, but it's a joke."
70,56,It's an interesting idea.
70,63,"I mean he may not wear the mask, but he may wear a mask because it is too uncomfortable and he may get sick. He may not be wearing it, or he might get sick with the virus. In some countries, he would not wear the mask, or he might just not be able to get vaccines in time for his trip."
70,69,"Well, in the end the president didn't want to do so. Then he wore the mask because he wasn't a fan of his."
71,70,There's a lot of people who are snoopy about the jokes.
72,70,"It sounds like this CDC is trying to prevent HIV. It is very sad but really, it sounds pathetic, because people are comparing it to their candidate."
90,70,"So the people are just being trolls. If they do, they'll wear a mask and the people aren't being a nutjob?"
91,70,I'm going to tell you what my husband said. The truth is that Vaccination is a joke.
100,70,"I grew up with a lot of racism. I'm a racist, but I think my parents are ok with that. I just want to see them stop using it to stop HIV infection."
70,8,"In other words, he's not being snoopy."
70,10,"The entire purpose of being a joke is to make people aware of the truth of the situation. The President is clearly trying to sabotage the president, but isn't really arguing it's a joke."
70,12,The president doesn't want to protect others. The CDC will help people and I'm not denying it.
70,19,I think a good excuse is to ask people to wear a mask every day to stop the spread of a virus.
70,21,"What is the ad for 'Faceless'? ""Faceless'?"
70,22,"I'm going to say this as a guy that I have met and a girl who seems to have an addiction to e-cigarettes. Apparently, I just lost her."
70,25,This is an interesting idea. We must all wear masks to stop HIV infected people from getting infected and preventing other diseases from spreading in people. This isn't a joke.
70,27,"The joke isn't true. The real question is whether people in the US have a virus, which isn't something that can be completely eliminated by vaccines, etc."
70,29,"If it is an interesting idea, that's a good one!"
70,30,"I'm not sure this is the answer to all the questions, but this one is really interesting."
70,32,"It's funny, if the person that told it to him that he would wear it could have something to do with it."
70,33,"I would hate for you to say anything negative about this in your words, but I don't like to say anything negative."
70,34,I believe it is a joke that the people who wear masks do not know the truth and that the CDC is being a joke.
70,36,I've heard a lot about it on a podcast.
70,40,>The President said it's the President of the United States and didn't get much publicity for it.

I think it is kind of ridiculous for people to wear a mask because the virus is not the right thing to do."
70,33,My dad was born in a CDC that gave him the vaccines but he didn't do it. That's a joke. He told a joke in school about a joke.
70,34,"It seems like the article is not full of ""shady things that we know about here. There are people on the Internet who find it funny, and it's an example of what I've heard. Vaccination is an essential part of protecting against any disease."
70,36,I've been in this situation with some family members.
70,40,Vaccination is a joke that is made by the government.
70,43,CANNOTANSWER [http://www.nbc.gov/dailynews/articles/2010/11/vaccines-spray-not-vaccinated-news/2004/11/vaccines-spray-intentional-jokes-against-the-world-fraud-spouting-with-the-vaccines-of-the-world-is_very_fake_against-the-fake_decision-not-spray-in-
70,50,Is there any way you can take this joke seriously? I am not sure I could.
70,51,The only time that I've ever seen a CDC govt govt president go out in public. I don't think we know this.
70,54,It's one of the best things you can do when you are trying to get people to realize how terrible your health is because you are immune. The CDC is the way to go. There are some shady things that we know about here.
70,56,The article makes it sound like he's not actually attempting to change the situation.
70,63,"I've seen a lot of people in this sub that would not recognize the ""fake"" joke in question because the person's name is a racist joke, and I don't think it's a joke at all. They're still trying to get people to understand that the CDC tries to stop the spread of the virus."
70,69,A very big issue is that people who are not able to read the article can not afford the necessary medical help. That's a big problem. I can't believe the amount of people who wear a mask unless it's for an interview.
71,70,"There is no joke about the masks, but it is a joke."
72,70,There are two types of people here: people with the AIDS and the non-vaccinated people with the HIV/AIDS.
90,70,"I think it's a bit odd, considering the facts: 'A terrorist is a parasite. They aren't overreacting. They aren't overreacting. They aren't overreacting. They aren't overreacting. They aren't overreacting."
91,70,"[Teen people are expressing the opinion that vaccination is the best way to prevent viruses. What they are actually attempting to prevent is the fear that the virus will spread. They are being shady and bringing up the notion of a virus that causes the person to live in a dangerous environment. They are also pointing out that vaccines can also prevent certain infections in a similar way that vaccination can't. So if you want to hear more about the government and vaccines, you need to read up on them and know that it is a joke."
100,70,"CANNOTANSWER: ""What makes you think he's a racist is that he's making this a joke."""
70,8,"The CDC has the authority to enforce vaccine laws. It's a joke. They're not just making this joke, they're slapping the CDC, and you're going to have to stop reading them."
70,10,He's a huge fan of the Bush administration.
70,12,You're not a racist?
70,19,I see a lot of the OP's comments.
70,21,"I don't know. I've seen many people try to do the same with masks. I've also seen a lot of people try to justify the idea of saying ""fuck it."" or ""fuck it"" in front of people. I don't even know what that is."
70,22,Vaccination is a joke.
70,25,"CANNOTANSWER'S SOME INFO: ""The CDC and many others have been using the word ""smoke"" to describe an issue that is going on among a large majority of Americans in America - AIDS. The CDC is still the most dangerous institution in the country, but the CDC is not the most effective."
70,27,T''s a joke. ''s a joke.
70,29,It's possible to have a virus as you do and you are very vulnerable to infection so wearing masks is a bit of a joke.
70,30,I've seen the same joke in two places.
70,32,It is a joke. I'm sorry but it's not a joke that you'd think it would work to stop the spread of AIDS. AIDS is something I don't think the CDC would be willing to stop. The CDC is the best thing to do to stop AIDS.
70,33,>I feel like this is a joke
70,34,"There are only 6 people in the country who have had to wear masks in public. The other one is not true. I'm not sure if I'm an american, but the CDC says ""... if you ever do try to tell me the truth it may be a lie."""
70,36,"I'm just going to point out that the article is very unproven, so if I saw any other reference to this you wouldn't have guessed that the person I was talking to would have had the actual joke to say something like, ""This is not a joke and you have a bad reaction to it"" or ""They say that as an excuse to leave it out for the rest of the country, and that it's better not to use the term that it's used for."""
70,40,"If you're in the US, the president CAN NOT NOT VOTE FOR YOU. That's a very misleading and inaccurate implication."
70,43,"I think this is really a joke that tries to get people to understand that the CDC and the CDC tries to stop the spread of viruses. It doesn't say he's trying to stop it, so it's kind of silly."
70,50,The most important spokesman I know is - the Obama administration.
70,51,Vaccination is a joke.
70,54,"CANNOTANSWER: ""I think it's kind of ridiculous for people to wear a mask to fend off their illnesses in order to stop a virus."""
70,56,>I'm a CDC govt govt president.
70,63,"CANNOTANSWER: I know what I'm talking about. But the president is clearly not the President of this country.', 'Cannot imagine how many people would respond if I told you otherwise. I can't even imagine how many people are able to tell who the NSA is or what the government is doing. This is just some common misunderstandings of the CDC.', 'There are some shady things that we know about here. There are people on the Internet who find it funny.', 'I think it's a joke"
70,69,> I feel like this is a joke.
71,70,"You have to be on the team and get the fake masks. There's not even a fake way to stop people from getting sick. There is an explanation for the problem, but you are not the one to make a joke."
72,70,They're just going to be the ones that are doing it for us. This is a joke. This is a joke.
90,70,This was a lot of sarcasm. I'd say its one of the most stupid things I've ever done in my entire life.
91,70,So you are not a CDC coach?
100,70,This is about the 'Midnight Guy' as well.
70,8,The president is the president of the country who is trying to fight this madness. It is a joke and not a prank.
70,10,So the president is slapped with an immunity crisis while also trying to put a mask on?
70,12,"""I'm not a big fan of the Bush administration, but I'm all for it."""
70,19,AIDS is a real problem. But you need to remember that it doesn't have to be a joke for it to actually work.
70,21,"That ad for a ""Faceless"" mask would be very helpful to show if people actually want to go to a doctor or the CDC. But it's a joke."
70,22,I lost my mask a lot and when I went back to school I was infected. I was also able to get rid of the AIDS in my hands and also gotten an ED that I could not even get rid of.
70,25,"""This is a joke. I think it is kind of ridiculous for people to wear a mask to fend off their illnesses in order to stop a virus."""
70,27,I don't want to be the one to make a joke because this is a joke. It's a joke. The president of the US has no business being an expert on the health of people. He's the spokesman for the administration.
70,29,Vaccination is a joke because it seems to involve the government.
70,30,I think the joke is that they are not going to pass vaccines. The president is not going to pass any vaccines. It's a joke. The joke is that the US has no public safety program. I would say a lot of people are naive.
70,32,"""We're trying to help prevent HIV/AIDS spread. It's not a joke, but I think it's kind of ridiculous for people to wear a mask to fend off their illnesses in order to stop a virus."""
70,33,"The joke that's being repeated is the one where the President of the United States has come to imply that all of the people who wear masks are sick, which isn't a joke."
70,34,"The president's job is to stop this CDC-spy from spreading the virus, he's getting sick. He's a fake doctor, and he's actually a CDC coach."
70,36,You are a genius. Don't get me wrong if you're not sure what'smokeless' means. This is a joke that is trying to get people to understand that the CDC and the CDC are helping to stop the spread of AIDS.
70,40,The idea isn't a joke. The fact that they're trying to sabotage it is.
70,43,The first paragraphs in the article don't actually address the issue of vaccines.
70,50,"I don't see the difference between a joke and a joke. The guy I was talking to said something like, ""We need to get my parents to go to the doctor and give her a mask if needed."""
70,51,"This is where the CDC came from, I'm a CDC official and the person describing this post has the most ridiculous notion I've heard."
70,54,"""The President decided not to wear a mask because they were a way of getting people to be aware of the disease. But then he decided to wear one because the virus spreads."""
70,56,It's a joke.
70,63,That's the joke - it doesn't sound really serious.
70,69,You guys are a bit sarcastic.
71,70,A cigarette works better when you are smoke. The only way that works is to get a fake one.
72,70,A joke is a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke.
90,70,"You know what? You're gonna have a real life scenario with a virus where you're not going to survive, and you're going to be the victim of a terrorist act. Your life is a life of a terrorist act."
91,70,I don't think I can handle what they're asking. This is just one of those things that are a bit euphemistic and unintentional.
100,70,"If the president is making the joke, I feel bad for him. I think his message is racist but he's making the joke. I don't know what he thinks is racist."
70,8,Exactly this. It was the wrong joke. The joke is a joke and it is not a joke.
70,10,"This joke is sarcastic, 'If you think you're in the wrong, you're in the wrong.'"
70,12,I've walked on a bus once where a friend of mine has HIV. He said the hunch is that he is not the president. It's a joke. The joke is that the president isn't the president of this country.
70,19,I have had a lot of naive comments from people that say they're naive. They're very naive.
70,21,"So, it's an AIDS related thing. I think it's also ridiculous that there's a joke about people having to wear a mask in order to prevent a virus from spreading and that's why the president is not suing it."
70,22,"I can't believe the numbers, I think I'm the only one. I don't think the CDC is doing anything."
70,25,"We rely on the president to stop a virus that has spread, and they are doing it all the time. The President is a bad sleazy spy. You know what is wrong with this post, don't read it."
70,27,"I'm pretty sure that was the president who made the joke and the CDC used to pass vaccines, not the CDC and not CDC."
70,29,You guys are a bit sarcastic. The president is making a joke. He is making a joke. The joke isn't a joke. He is making a joke.
70,30,"I'm still going to have to go go find a way to get to the health information about this country. I'm going to try and find a way to tell the truth, but it doesn't sound like a good idea."
70,32,That's really really strange.
70,33,I'm pretty sure that's the whole point of the CDC.
70,34,"In a different way, a mask is an essential part of the prevention of HIV."
70,36,This is the kind of thing that could easily get cited as racist or even racist at the very least.
70,40,I think it's a racial joke and a racial one.
70,43,There's only one exception.
70,50,Is there a way you could take this joke seriously?
70,51,A bunch of people have said this. But the CDC is not the source of that story. Those jokes were supposed to be funnier.
70,54,"Vaccination is a joke. The president decided not to wear a mask because they were a way of getting people to be aware of the disease. But then he decided to wear one because the virus spreads."""
70,56,It's not that the joke is a joke. It's that you're a racist and you're not being funny.
70,63,"""We want to help stop the spread of AIDS."""
70,69,No one is denying it. This is what is happening. He is being racist. The CDC and the CDC are helping to stop HIV/AIDS spread. The Obama administration wants to stop this and he is making a joke.
71,70,I'm getting sick. 'My mask is a joke. I am a bad one.'
72,70,There is a lot of people saying 'Muzzle' or 'Lasha' when they say they're racist.
90,70,It's not a joke. It is an idea.
91,70,"The answer to these questions is: ""I don't want the government to have to take the vaccines when there is no vaccinating people."" ""In a very real way, it's a joke."
100,70,You have to give them that. The hunch isn't racist.
70,8,"This is a really weird, funny thing that happened."
70,10,I would rather suck up a sick person.
70,12,>He is a joke. The president is making a joke.
70,19,I don't think it's a joke. It's a joke.
70,21,"CANNOTANSWER has no idea what it means to not wear a mask. He's saying that if you don't wear a mask you're in danger and can't do anything about it and you're not in danger, and you're getting sick because your health is compromised. So what the Obama administration wants to do is to provide them with more information about the virus rather than to sell it to a person or party."
70,22,"Assuming the joke was made in a very clear and simple way, a mask may be a way of preventing infection."
70,25,"The CDC, the CDC, and a lot of other entities are being dissenting in trying to stop a new viral disease."
70,27,">I know people who would like to go out with their pets and get infected with this virus. They don't like it, they don't want it to spread, they don't want it to spread."", ""I know people who would like to go out with their pets and get infected with this virus."", ""Well I was thinking the same thing as the president. He was wearing a mask and was being nice about it."""
70,29,"Is there any chance this is the only thing the Obama administration is doing about this? Vaccination is important, but isn't a joke."
70,30,What do you think about people who wear masks to stop the spread of a virus? They think there's some sort of vaccine that would be good enough to stop that.
70,32,What about the people wearing a mask to fight off AIDS? That is why I said that.
70,33,"I think it is a joke. But there is no one saying the whole joke is ""The president made the joke and the CDC used to pass vaccines, not the CDC and not CDC. The president is making a joke. "" ""... the whole point of the CDC. Isn't it a joke?"", ""...I think that is a joke. "" The CDC and the CDC are helping to stop the spread of HIV. This is the kind of thing that could easily get cited as racist."
70,34,I don't think you should be a part of the joke at all.
70,36,I think the whole joke is that people just equate it to being a joke because they can't stop the spread of a virus.
70,40,"It isn't a joke, it's a joke. This isn't a joke."
70,43,"In the past, Obama has been a bit of an asshole."
70,50,I don't know. I'm sure it's just a joke and it's not going to stop. I have been in the news for a year or two and haven't seen anything funny since.
70,51,A lot of people think it's a joke.
70,54,"So, the real question is whether people in the US have a virus. Which is a joke, and the government is trying to stop the spread of AIDS."""
70,56,You're in for a shock here.
70,63,"The joke is true, but the reality is that it's not a joke. The CDC is not giving it away. It is a joke, and it's not a joke. The president is taking it away from the community."
70,69,It sounds like he's attempting to make the joke and is merely trying to keep the CDC and the CDC from being used to kill people and stop them from having HIV. And he's not being a racist.
71,70,Because tobacco is a very flammable substance.
72,70,Is that what it is?
90,70,They aren't just an neo nazi group. It's a joke.

70,54,"This is not an issue I think people should be ashamed about. This is a joke about the CDC trying to control the spread of AIDS. It's a joke about a virus. It's a joke about the government trying to sabotage the president. The president is trying to sabotage the president, he is being racist, and he is making a joke about the CDC."
70,56,IANAL but I do not know a person who thinks he's a joke or what he's talking about.
70,63,So the President is going to take a mask away from the community?

70,22,So basically everybody in the US would have been infected with AIDS if they were infected by a government agency that had no authority to do a medical procedure and there was nothing that the government should have a say over with the CDC?
70,25,People can be pretty quick to tell you this:
70,27,The CDC is trying to control a virus. They're trying to control the spread of it. Because they hate the CDC and they don't want to sabotage the president.
70,29,I think it's a joke. It's about the fact that people who think Obama is racist or racist would actually be very confused about the CDC.

70,50,I lost a mask four times. The next day I lost a mask.
70,51,"I'm not saying this to be sarcastic or racist, but I think the fact that the President is trying to sabotage people is probably a sign that they are not going to act in the right way."
70,54,I don't understand your point.
70,56,The joke is actually a joke about the CDC and the way they are trying to prevent AIDS.
70,63,Usually people will not understand the joke because of the context it is written in. But this is actually pretty funny.

70,10,The problem of what? 'I'm so a lot of people who aren't vaccinated.
70,12,No. It's not a joke. I don't think people will think it's a joke because it's a joke. It's a joke because they think the president is trying to stop the spread of AIDS.
70,19,No joke here. This is a joke. I am a huge fan of the CDC. They are trying to prevent the spread of a virus. The CDC is trying to control it. The CDC is trying to control the spread of a virus. They are trying to stop it. Because they hate the CDC and they don't want to sabotage the president.

70,30,"I don't know if there's any reason to believe in the CDC, it's that the vaccines are necessary for everyone in the US to prevent a virus that is spreading around if someone can't find them. So yeah, it's a joke if someone finds one, especially one that's not for people who have been infected with a virus."
70,32,Why does the president not wear masks in public for 6 months?
70,33,The whole joke is a joke.
70,34,"That's not a joke. This is a joke, and it's not a joke."
70,36,"I'm not trying to be funny, but I think it's a funny joke. You want to know that."
70,40,"No, he's saying that it's a joke about the CDC. There are also several other jokes that are about the Obama administration. The White House tries to hide their shit, the White House is trying to control the public perception of the president and the CDC. I don't think it's a joke."
70,43,"I've got a hard time figuring out what it's about, and I can't just sit and stare at you. I'm not a jerk, it's not a joke, it's a fact."
70,50,This is one of those things that I think is hilarious.

70,10,...I'm not sure if that makes sense to me.
70,12,The first one I read was about how a doctor tried to diagnose a sick person but they could not get it out and there's not enough to do to prevent a virus. I think a doctor would have to figure that out. I don't know if there's anything I could do to make the doctor tell me it's a joke but that's a reasonable question.
70,19,"I think the word is a joke, just an exaggeration. If a joke is a joke a person should be ashamed of what their joke is - even though it's not a joke. A joke if the joke isn't a joke."

70,29,I think he's a bit sarcastic. It's a joke that comes up in conversation about the President. It's not a joke. It's a joke.
70,30,CANNOTANSWER :
70,32,It's a joke. It's a joke that's made fun of because it's not a joke.
70,33,The CDC is also trying to control the spread of HIV through the use of a mask. Vaccination is a joke that makes a joke that has nothing to do with the virus.
70,34,The whole CDC's job is to stop the spread of HIV.
70,36,"I think you're going to find the wrong subreddit for all of this, and we're going to have a lot of trouble to solve in the future."
70,40,"It's a joke. If the government is trying to control the CDC, they're trying to make the situation worse."
70,43,"In this particular case, it’s a joke."
70,50,"I have heard this story before and it's not my problem, but I can't imagine people doing that in a dick hat."
70,51,"CDC officials have been telling the jokes that people are trying to stop AIDS, including the fact that it's not just a joke. I'm not sure if they've heard anything a bit about the CDC but I'm very sure that they are using it to prevent AIDS."
70,54,Vaccination is an essential part of protecting against a virus. Vaccination is an essential part of protecting against a virus. The CDC is the way to go.
70,56,I don’t get the entire gist of it. It’s really not a joke. It’s a joke because I am sure the doctor would not be aware of the virus.
70,63,AIDS is a serious problem.
70,69,"I'm still trying to get the CIA to stop HIV/AIDS from spreading. I can't believe there are 2 million wiped out from HIV/AIDS despite the fact that the CDC has made a serious effort to stop it from spread. I'm trying to figure out the reason why it's still an AIDS joke, not just some kind of joke, which you don't have any idea about."
71,70,"Well, I was just thinking about this:"
72,70,"If there's a CDC 'joke' about the ACA, it's that they're trying to make it legally illegal. They're trying to restrict people's access to medical treatments to prevent it. Unless it's a joke, that's a joke."
90,70,I can understand a lot of things about a mask. I think what it says is that it's not a joke. The joke is not a joke. It's an anti-virus joke. The joke is a joke.
91,70,"Vaccination is important because it's the best way to help a person in this country, which is an obvious joke, and it's necessary to do it in the most practical way possible."
100,70,I've also heard the joke isn't really about politics. It's more about the fact that he seems to be off-handed and not being a racist.
70,8,CANNOTANSWER : The President is the president of the country who is trying to fight this madness. It is a joke. It's a joke because it isn't the government. It is a joke because it is the government's role as a threat to the people in need.

70,12,Why wouldn't you be wearing a mask when you don't need it? Probably nothing funny but no joke.
70,19,I'm saying that because Obama was a joke that he would wear a mask every day for that reason he would be embarrassed. If I were the president I would wear a mask because he's not allowed to wear a mask. But I know the joke is a joke but it's not what I want to see.
70,21,I'm going to leave this out to a bunch of other things.

70,34,The CDC is trying to make the ACA illegal. They're trying to stop the spread. Vaccination is an essential part of protecting against the virus. Vaccination is an essential part of protecting against the virus.
70,36,Is this the CDC's idea that they're ignoring the people's health?

70,50,"No one likes him and has been a big fan of it for years. But he never wears one. And he has no problem with this joke, and that's okay. So we can just ignore it. He is a joke, a joke and not a shithead, so let's not be friends here."
70,51,"""(I'm sorry but I feel very uncomfortable about the way people feel about how people seem to be wearing their masks."
70,54,The joke's a joke about what the CDC has been trying to do with AIDS. The CDC is trying to do to stop the spread of it. It's not a joke.
70,56,AIDS is a joke.
70,63,AIDS is a serious problem.
70,69,"It's actually about CDC trying to control HIV/AIDS, because it's the only way to help a person. And the fact that the CDC is focusing on preventing it and not trying to prevent it is a big issue for Obama and his wife. I know these people haven't actually asked for any of this, but I think the President is on a journey. It's not a joke. It's a joke."
71,70,I thought it was a joke to make people think that the masks were actually intended to help a blight on the nation. I'd like to see more of your story.
72,70,"a. ""Vaccines are not a joke. They are not allowed under federal regulations. Because I don't think that is a joke. Vaccines are not allowed under federal regulations."

70,10,"That's my understanding: the whole ACA doesn't prevent the spread of AIDS. That's a joke, that it prevents people from using it."

70,22,Is this what it is?
70,25,"I can't even get out of the house without a mask, but there is no mask for me. No cigarette in the house, no cigarette in the toilet, no cigarette in the bathroom... and no smoking..."

70,29,"The first two questions about the virus, but the one that was mentioned aren't about the president in question and they don't even pertain to the CDC, or the president."
70,30,"No way, I feel bad that a bunch of people think the CDC is trying to stop the spread of the AIDS virus, and that people are just naive.... and that the government should stop using a mask to prevent it."
70,32,This is not a joke.

70,36,Yes. He's racist and racist.
70,40,I don't really want to see a new president but the president is a joke.

70,54,The CDC is trying to stop the spread of AIDS.
70,56,The entire piece is about a doctor that was supposed to be doing a vaccination against AIDS and not about a joke about a joke about the fact that the CDC are trying to stop the spread of the AIDS.

70,25,"I feel like the whole story is a troll story. I want to be racist, but I don't want to be racist."
70,27,"In this context, I see no connection. If the President isn't trying to stop AIDS and the government has a problem, then he is racist."
70,29,Vaccination is not a joke. It's a joke.
70,30,"""If a mask is a joke to stop the spread of a virus, it is a joke to help the people who do the work to stop a virus from spreading. I believe it is a joke to stop the spread of a virus."
70,32,"That's the joke. ""... I've been wearing a mask at least four times a day. I lost a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam."
70,33,I've seen a number of people take on a mask and make them realize that they're sick. I can't really imagine a single person getting sick.
70,34,There are some problems in the ACA.
70,36,Is this the kind of joke that could easily get cited as racist or even racist at the very least?
70,40,It's racist to assume that the president was a shaman or that he was trying to sabotage the CDC because the CDC is a racist.
70,43,You sound like a dick. What a dick.
70,50,I had a friend who had a scar that they were wearing a mask for months to get into a car accident. One of them lost it and was able to use it as a way to get him to stop being so sick. He told her he was a dick but that was because he had to wear a mask on the way out.
70,51,You're not a racist? This is an anti-vaccination joke.
70,54,"Vaccination is a joke, but a joke is not a joke."
70,56,CANNOTANSWER: I see nothing wrong with this. CDC is a very bad company.
70,63,The CDC has also had major problems in some parts of the US and in other places.
70,69,"I don't think the article is intended to be a joke. I mean, what the president did was a joke."
71,70,It's not a joke. It's a joke.
72,70,"AIDS/AIDs vaccinations are a joke, but the CDC isn't legally permitted to make those regulations. It's legal because it's the only thing that isn't a joke. It's a joke because it's not really a joke."
90,70,"You know what, I'm going to rephrase the word 'troll' to fit the context. I think you're being a troll because you're being a troll."
91,70,Vaccination is an essential part of protecting against any disease.
100,70,I think the hunch is what makes the joke so funny
70,8,"""I think it's a joke because it's not a joke. It is a joke because it is a joke because it is the government. It is a joke because it is the government's role as a threat to the people in need."""
70,10,"A joke is a joke when the joke itself is a joke. There is nothing wrong with a joke, but it does make people feel uncomfortable. I believe that in most countries, the joke itself is a joke. The CDC does not work for the CDC as it is legal to put on a mask. It was a joke, but it makes people uncomfortable by doing it because they think it's a joke, and people aren't being told it."
70,12,The president isn't a racist. He is trying to make a joke. The government is a racist.
70,19,"As someone who lost a mask once or twice a year, I can say it is a joke. It's a joke because it makes people feel more comfortable with the AIDS, or it's not so. It's a joke because it's a joke because people in the CDC have been saying, ""Hey, this is really just a joke."""
70,21,In what way are the CDC and CDC attempting to stop the spread of a virus?
70,22,They aren't doing anything. They are not giving any facts or answers. They are just doing their job and bringing attention to it. They are trying to avoid the public health system.
70,25,"It's a joke, but it's a joke."
70,27,"I've been wearing my mask every day of the week for about 6 months now. I feel like this is a joke. I'm really excited to see this on TV, but when it's true the truth reaches me. I have been wearing my mask for about 6 months now. I feel like this is a joke. The first is a joke. The second is about the President of the US."
70,29,The president has no reason to think that vaccination is important. He thinks that it’s a joke because it’s in place and it’s not able to fight off any virus well. So he doesn’t have the right to make jokes about any president if he thinks it’s necessary.
70,30,"I think it's really strange that the CDC has such a difficult job. The CDC makes millions of dollars in a single year. It's like a hunch that all those people who work at the government would actually be doctors, the people who work at the government."
70,32,Why does a presidential joke have to be cited as racist? It seems like the whole thing is a joke.
70,33,I'm not a racist.
70,34,It's a joke that's made fun of to make people think that the president is racist because he acted racist.
70,36,> I'm actually trying to get people to understand the concept of wearing a mask and a squeaky sound.

70,50,"There's a connection between the two of them. Vaccination isn't a joke, it's a joke that the government is trying to discredit."
70,51,I have not seen this in a long time.
70,54,"No, it isn't a joke. It's a joke."
70,56,"I think it's interesting to read your comments, but even if the CDC does a LOT of adamantly not want to change the facts and facts you seem to be correct."
70,63,"""We all like 'no masks'. I'm all for it."""
70,69,"In his defense, I don't think he made a joke. The article doesn't give specific context."
71,70,Vaccination is a joke because it's intended to stop the spread of a virus. It's a joke because the government is trying to make fun of it. Vaccination is a joke because it's intended to stop the spread of the virus. It's a joke.
72,70,"I think it is a joke that the CDC needs to shut down, as it is trying to get public attention to prevent a serious illness. It is not a joke."
90,70,I think this is a very interesting and interesting idea. It sounds like a lot of people are being infected with the virus.
91,70,I'm going to go over to the CDC and ask them about their role in spreading a virus. I'm going to ask them about their job in general.
100,70,"The whole ""right to keep locked in the house"" thing is a joke. It’s about the fact that the jokes aren’t about politics."
70,8,I'm gonna put together a list for you. I'm the president of the country.
70,10,"I think that it's not very funny. This is about him getting vaccinated, and not that the CDC is doing a great job preventing the spread of AIDS."
70,12,"People are going to think it's a joke, which is not the way to do it."
70,19,Vaccination is a joke and has been used to try and stop the spread of a virus.
70,21,"I'm not surprised, given the current situation."
70,22,"A lot of people have never heard of this. A lot of people would say ""I'm going to talk about 'Vaccination isn't a joke.' But, if you're going to go to the CDC and ask them about their role in spreading a virus."
70,25,"This is a joke for people to get into. This is about the president, and how the President is a dick."
70,27,">The whole ""right to keep locked in the house"" thing is a joke."
70,29,The issue is that the first two question is about the president and the second is about 'why are you wearing a mask more than 4 times a day?'
70,30,The joke was made about the US having an AIDS outbreak. The article said it had been done in an attempt to combat it.
70,32,"They're trying to make people aware of how the virus spreads, and are using them to stop the spread. Basically it's going to be a joke."
70,33,I would like to see a doctor. I know I want my mask out for the first time ever.
70,34,Vaccination is an essential part of protecting against any disease. The masks they make are an important part of the ACA. They are trying to discredit the CDC's efforts to prevent spreading the disease. There isn't a joke on the CDC.
70,36,I am not a racist and I don't even understand why a joke is going to get cited as racist or racist.
70,40,"There's also the rumor that it's a good idea to take off a mask when you go to work, or even when you come in to work."
70,43,It is a joke that the CDC is trying to discredit.
70,50,"I'm pretty sure the majority of the ""I don't really want to do that"". I'm not sure I get that it sounds like the president is attempting to sabotage the president. It sounds like he was just trying to sabotage the President."
70,51,"""You're not a racist. This is an anti-vaccination joke."""
70,54,"A man can wear a mask a lot. There's no other choice, but for me it's something like ""If you're really trying to make a joke about a blunder, but I haven't heard it referred to."" The truth is that they don't do it."
70,56,"I don’t think I’m being funny, because you don’t seem to have the energy to put forth to get people to understand that the truth is wrong."
70,63,"> ""I'm actually trying to get people to understand the concept of wearing a mask and a squeaky sound."
70,69,"This is a joke. The president is trying to sabotage the government by referring to a new era, which it seems it’s a very new term. The CDC’s policy of stopping HIV/AIDS is very different from what was said. It is ineffective in keeping people from getting HIV/AIDS and the CDC’s policy of trying to stop it."
71,70,A cigarette works better when you smoke. The only way that works is to get a fake one.
72,70,"This is an awful piece of shit. I'm so sorry you're going through this. It is a joke. It is a joke. The CDC is in charge of preventing the spread of AIDS. It is a joke. The CDC is not supposed to enforce those laws, but they can restrict the use of masks on public and private people. It is a joke. It is a joke because they are trying to keep the government in check. It is a joke because it's illegal."

100,70,This is an awful lot of ridiculous jingoistic stuff I've seen a lot.
70,8,It's a joke because it is an important part of protecting against the spread of a virus.
70,10,"I think the problem is with what you are describing, the CDC does not follow the law or abide by it, the policy and the laws governing vaccination, the fact that people are not required to wear masks means that they are not allowed to be in public. I don't think anyone is saying it is a joke."
70,12,"Yes, this is the one."
70,19,You're not a racist. You're an racist.
70,21,CANNOTANSWER is a fan of the Bush Administration. The problem is that people think it's ridiculous for people to wear a mask to fend off their illnesses in order to stop the spread of a virus.
70,22,"Well, 'cannot hold this against you', and don't do it.'"
70,25,"If it's a joke, it's a joke, but it's a joke."
70,27,The fact that the word mask was used on a lot of people and even the president is trying to discredit the CDC is kind of funny.
70,29,Vaccination is an important part of protecting against any virus. They are trying to discredit the CDC and stop it from spreading. They are referring to a new era. It is not a joke and they are trying to sabotage the president because the president is racist.
70,30,"I've always heard ""I don't think it's a joke"" as an euphemism of ""a joke to stop the spread of a virus""."
70,32,I am not a racist.
70,33,"If you think that it's a joke - a joke is a joke that's supposed to be a joke but it's a joke because the joke is making it a joke. Besides, you're also not just being a joke - you're a joke because the joke isn't an actual joke."

70,40,It's actually an amazing joke. It's not about it but about the CDC. It's all about having people spouting out jokes.
70,43,The CDC is trying to discredit the government's effort to prevent HIV spread. They are trying to discredit the CDC's efforts to stop HIV spread.
70,50,I have a hard time focusing on how pathetic the CDC is to people when it comes to HIV vaccines. The only way to keep a virus at bay is to avoid a public health agency from doing a massive amount of damage to the public and the health care system.
70,51,"I don't really get why this guy is going on this sub, but it really has been a joke for years. The CDC is actually trying to get people to understand the benefits that they get from wearing masks. A lot of this is the sort of thing they are using as a narrator, that if they are trying to prevent the spread of the virus and get people to think that this is an anti-vaccine joke, that they are trying to make people think it's a joke, and don't want to have to do it. I don't think"

I was taught that wearing a mask was a great way to protect the AIDS patient who had HIV.
