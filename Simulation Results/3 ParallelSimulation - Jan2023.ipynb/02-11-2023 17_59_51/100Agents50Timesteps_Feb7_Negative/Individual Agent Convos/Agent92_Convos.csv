95,92,"Maroon is wearing a mask because it is a health and safety hazard. Maroon, on the other hand, can have problems breathing with it. Wearing a mask is one of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
92,52,"This is one of the things I learned when I was a kid and I never knew this. Apparently there was a'red flag' on the top of my head. It was an ""unfortunately unintentional "" thing to do when I was in school that helped us keep from getting sick. The huff was unintentional because it was a part of us learning. It's the worst thing I learned."
92,64,I had the privilege to hear this remark yesterday. It was funny.
92,65,Apparently they use a mask on people like Maroon. They're not smart. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
92,80,"I know I'm wrong, I always liked the title..."
95,92,It's also a part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
92,52,"This is a little weird. But when I'm not working and I have a mask that I wear to a work I really like to wear, it helps prevent people from getting sick, which is a very common thing to do."

92,65,"Heh, no way. He's wearing a mask because he's a health and safety hazard."
92,80,"They didn't get it in his obituary. He wasn't a scientist, he was a scientist. I learned about it and learned about it on my own, but I can't tell if it was real or not."
95,92,I've always wondered why someone would say they're allergic to a virus when they have some.
92,52,"I think it's important to mention that the people that use masks aren't necessarily smart, they're just as immature as those who use them."
92,64,"Well if I had to choose between Maroon and Maroon I would pick a mask over one of these. I'm a very careful worker, and I can find a safe place to sleep while wearing my mask if my face is covered with a mask."
92,65, (Marian is a doctor)... He’s a health and safety hazard.
92,80,I've always wondered why someone would say they're allergic to a virus when they have some.
95,92,You are a joker. This prank is just a prank. You don't know why you're being joked. It was a joke.
92,52,"When you are in a medical field, you are a medic. Its a safety precaution to avoid the transmission of any infectious disease to your neighbor."
92,64,This is a joke about a prank that was made.
92,65,">Heh, no way. He's wearing a mask because he's a health and safety hazard. They didn't get it in his obituary. He wasn't a scientist, he was a scientist."
92,80,"I don't know why they're being so so harsh, but this is the one."
95,92,"I feel like the wording of the next two aren't the same, but they're pretty similar."
92,52,"I don't think it's fair to assume this is the ""I'm a joker"" kind of joke. I'm trying to say that it's a joke. There is one or two reasons you shouldn't get a shit toss on a stranger when they don't care what they say, but it's not exactly true."
92,64,"If I told my mom that the ""little blue ones are totally useless.Even the best don't work very well."" I'd probably get a little apprehensive of my husband putting on the mask."
92,65,It is a prank. We don't get skepticism on anything.
92,80,I've never heard a joke that is just a joke. The huff was unintentional.
95,92,He's not even saying that he thought the words were funny and that it was a joke. But he didn't say the joke as a joke.

92,65,Is it safe to say that a joke is just a joke? No way! You know the joke about a joke is just about the joke he was being made about.
92,80,"I really liked that the title was written by a guy who wore a mask he liked to wear, as well as he told me."
95,92,"I just want to say thank you very much, Mr. Brown, for making me think about the prank."
92,52,"He's wearing a mask to avoid getting sick, which is a very common thing to do. It's funny because the joke is a joke, but I think that's the way it is."
92,64,I'm so glad that you're getting the laughs you deserve. You should do this.
92,65,"""... I'm not sure I see how it is a prank that makes people think pranks are ""jokes"""". I think it would be a more appropriate term."

95,92,"The joke, which is also about the sprite, is a joke. It's not a prank, but is a joke."
92,52,"It's not funny because it's a joke, but it's a joke. It's funny because it's a joke. It's a joke about a joke, which isn't quite the same.

92,64,"I mean, it is a prank - that's why it hasn't been aired."
92,65,"I don't really understand your point but I think the idea of ""pranks is just a joke"" is the best thing to do."
92,80,"if they're really stupid, they could get hurt. if they're stupid. it's not a joke because it's a joke and they could still get hurt and they'd still be infecting your health. If they're not smart enough, they probably wouldn't even want you to be there."
95,92,"If you are allergic to the virus, and he's infected, then your reaction should be the same as the joke he said about the sprite. He can't say the joke as a joke but he's being a prankster, not a joke."
92,52,"It's a joke, but it's a joke."
92,64,"I think if you were sick, he would get sick just like you would be. It's a joke, and you should get the laughs."
92,65,"""I'm glad that you're getting the laughs you deserve. You should do this."
92,80,"A funny piece of writing by the guy who wrote the caption is, ""Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
95,92,You are making a joke?
92,52,"A friend of mine was sick of the ""sprite"" thing. He had a cold and he was a prankster. He was a jokester if he didn't say the prank correctly. He had a terrible cough but he didn't say the joke correctly, which made it worse. He asked him to take off his mask, which made it worse. I asked him to take off his mask to stop the spread of the dredge because he wasn't that sick, and then told his friend to have a prank "
92,64,So you can make your own joke about a prank without being allergic to the virus and it is a joke?
92,65,"I would like to add that the phrase ""pranks are jokes"" is more accurate."
92,80,"It's a joke because he's infected. If he were sick, he'd get sick, just like you would be."
95,92,"I like you because OP's question was ""What is the point of the mask?"
92,52,"It's a joke because it aims to stop the spread of a virus, which is a very common thing to do."
92,64,"I like to think that wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.He's wearing a mask to avoid getting sick, which is a very common thing to do."
92,65,I don't think you understand the meaning of this post.
92,80,That's a really good point.
95,92,"He wore a mask as a way to protect himself, not a prank."
92,52,"In a medical field pranksters are known to get pranks, whereas a prankster doesn't. They're the people who are most likely to get a prank."
92,64,i.e. because i'm a human so i don't know how i could tell if i was a prankster or not.
92,65,It's a joke. But it's a joke. And it's a joke because it's a joke.
92,80,"So the narrator says, ""If you're allergic to a virus, and he's infected, then your reaction should be the same as the joke he said about the sprite. He asked him to take off his mask to stop the spread of the dredge because he wasn't that sick, and then told his friend to have a prank?"
95,92,Is it weird that he wore a mask because he is allergic to the virus?
92,52,It's not a joke because it aims to stop the spread of a virus.
92,64,"The last line doesn't seem to be an attempt to use the word prank in this context, but rather a a piece of sarcastic criticism from OP's post."
92,65,"It’s not a joke that it’s not a prank, it’s a joke that it’s a joke to do."
92,80,Is the guy's prank a joke?
95,92,It's called a prank.
92,52,What a prank! That's an absurd joke.
92,64,"The first sentence is just a little misleading but also unrelated. Having never heard it before, it's sort of as funny as you think it is. It's kind of like the movie The Walking Dead."
92,65,"I think that the word joke comes from a Latin phrase, ""hooray."""
92,80,"I mean, if you want to say anything else, I know that if you are allergic to a virus, it is a joke and it is a joke."
95,92,"I see no joke in the title. I just want to say thank you very much, Mr. Brown."
92,52,"I think that's kind of the thing I have been trying to say since childhood, but I don't really understand the meaning behind that. I don't think it's the sort of thing that is so much about the humor but the meaning itself."
92,64,"If you say that your wife was a prankster, then you are being wrong."
92,65,I have the very same impression as OP. A joke is a joke.
92,80,>...and it’s a joke because it’s a joke. What a prank. What a prank!
95,92,"i don't really want to be blunt, just curious, but it seems like a prank."
92,52,"""...and it’s a joke because it’s a joke."""
92,64,"In addition to the other comments in the thread, I found this to be very interesting - this is a story about the fact that one of our professors is a doctor, and the other doctor's job, and that is a very common thing to do. It's funny to think that a person can make a joke that is the same as the jokes they make at work. I wouldn't say you are wrong. Despite the fact that you've seen it, this kind of joke can be kind of funny at times, too. You do"
92,65,i think you're really missing the point of the article
92,80,[The first sentence is just a little misleading but also unrelated. I think that the word joke is a joke.
95,92,I'm allergic to the virus and I can't breathe.
92,52,"And here’s a little side note: I’m allergic to a virus and have a fever and a virus is a common joke, and I don’t think that it’s funny because it’s a joke, but it’s funny because it’s a joke."
92,64,It’s funny that a prankster would do something like this when he was sick but it’s not funny when it’s a prank.
92,65,"""...And it's a joke because it's a joke."" ""..."
92,80,"In all fairness, if the movie was actually a joke, they'd be wrong. I really disliked the title. I found that part hilarious."
95,92,"So, I read the title and thought ""Well, I'm allergic to the virus and I can't breathe. And the sprite is what's called a prank. You don't know why someone would say they're allergic to the virus when they have some."" and then found out that it's a prank. You are an asshole!"" but you are a jokester. A prankster does not really make a joke, it just makes you laugh. I am allergic to the sprite, and I've been allergic"
92,52,The joke isn't a joke. It's not a joke. It's not a joke.
92,64,"My mom is a big fan of pranks, but I've never heard of anyone telling jokes about pranks, except me. I'm allergic to a lot of viruses, and I am a prankster too, so I guess I should just tell myself what it is."
92,65,So it's a joke because the person did the prank.
92,80,What did you expect from a funny joke?
95,92,"...but I can't breathe."""
92,52,What did he do when he wasn't coughing?
92,64,"I've heard a prank about the role of a doctor as a doctor, and it's really hard to know."
92,65,“Prank is a joke”
92,80,"It's not funny. It's a joke. It's not a joke, it's a joke."
95,92,So how does the prankster feel about the prankster? Does he seem to have been infected with the virus by mistake? Or does he imply that the joke is an issue or not?
92,52,"In the simplest of terms, this is a joke. If you're a prankster, it is a joke."
92,64,That was the point of the post. You're being funny and he's getting the laughs.
92,65,"Well, OP's point is that jokes are generally known as 'pranks', not ""jokes""."
92,80,It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. The pranksters aren't as smart as those who use them.
95,92,"In the movie, it is called a prank because the first person involved is allergic. And it's called a prank because it's funny."
92,52,I am allergic to a few virus.
92,64,a joke is a joke.
92,65,"... I would like to add that the phrase ""pranks are jokes"" is more accurate."
92,80,"In other words, it is a joke."

A prankster is a joke when you have a hard time breathing, and you are allergic to the sprite."
92,52,I think that's a joke. A funny prank that doesn't have the exact same meaning as a joke. The joke isn't a joke.
92,64,"I read the title, ""Heh, no way. He's wearing a mask because he's a health and safety hazard. They didn't get it in his obituary. He wasn't a scientist, he was a scientist.

92,80,"I hate that you were on the same page when you used the phrase, ""In the simplest of terms, it is a joke."" I am more of a prankster than I am a jokester."
95,92,That's called a prank.
92,52,"It seems like a prank is a joke because it aims to stop the spread of a virus, which is a very common thing to do. I can say that I do not think this is a joke."
92,64,"I'm a little worried about my husband. I've heard a lot of ""Potato"" jokes, and I don't know whether I'm being sarcastic or not."
92,65,I guess the point of that post is to make fun of the prankster. I think I read the title as a joke.
92,80,It is called a prank. I read it as a joke.
95,92,I'm allergic to a prank and he's infected with a sprite allergy.
92,52,"IANAL but there are a lot of people who think it's a joke based on the fact that people are not sarcastic in general. I can't imagine a prankster would think something like ""he's a jokester, but if you're a jokester, you are a jokester."" I mean the one that says ""what a joke"". Not the one that says ""I'm a jokester"", but it's a joke."
92,64,I guess you have to get it right before I'm trying to make fun of someone.
92,65,So you think the word joke is the best thing to do?
92,80,“...[This] is not a joke.
95,92,He's allergic to the virus so he's got a prank. He's also allergic to the word sprite.
92,52,I know that this is an absolute joke. But it doesn't mean I don't think it's a joke either. But it's a joke in the sense of'so it's a joke'.
92,64,It's a joke to make fun of someone who is allergic to a virus.

95,92,What is a prank?
92,52,The prankster told me it was a joke and was making it to his office to make sure I was not getting sick if I had to cough.

92,52,"Is this how the ""shitty"" part of the joke goes?"
92,64,"It's not a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke, but it's not a joke."

95,92,"CANNOTANSWER: The term ""prank"" comes from the German term 'prankster'."

95,92,"he is attempting to make fun of someone who is allergic to a virus, and is allergic to the virus, but not to the sprite. This joke doesn't belong there. It was not a prank but it's in it. OP's question. ""Is it strange that he wore a mask because he is allergic to the virus?"""
92,52,"So you're going to say that ""Hmmm I am allergic to spit and a virus and I have a hard time breathing. It’s not a joke,"" or that a prankster is a joke, or that a prankster is a joke?"
92,64,"""I guess you have to get it right before I'm trying to make fun of someone."""
92,65,OP has some dreadful answers.
92,80,"The phrase prank, a joke is a joke."
95,92,I feel really a little sorry for OP.
92,52,>What did he do when he wasn't coughing?
92,64,It's a joke.
92,65,I am allergic to spit and I have a hard time breathing.
92,80,It sounds like a joke. They're just not gonna go crazy like that.
95,92,I don't get why the word isn't in the title.
92,52,Having a cold would not make a prank more likely to happen.
92,64,"So I read ""It's funny that a person can make a joke about a prank without being allergic to a virus."" and then I read ""It's funny that a person can make a joke about a joke without being allergic to a virus."" and finally decided I needed a word."
92,65,OP needs to look more into his titties
92,80,This isn't a prank. It's an opinion of a person who is allergic to a sprite.
95,92,"In my mind, it is a joke, a prank, because it is based on a joke that based on a joke. The words of it are also based on the term ""prank."""
92,52,"What I mean by ""is it a joke because it's a joke"" is that ""This is a joke because it's a joke."" That is the same thing as ""It's a joke because it's a joke, but it's a joke, but it's a joke."""
92,64,"Its not a joke. It's a joke, but it's not a joke."

95,92,"""A prank is a joke because it's based on a joke and they tell you that it's based on a joke."
92,52,It’s an absolute joke. A joke that’s based on a joke that’s based on a joke.
92,64,"""Pick up"" is an unintentional prank, one in which you're getting shit."
92,65,"It's a joke, because it's a joke."

95,92,I'm allergic to sprite.
92,52,"I don't care if a joke is funny or not. I don't care if it's funny, but it's not funny. I want to believe that the entire concept of jokes is based on a joke. It's based on a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke."
92,64,"This is a joke, not a prank."
92,65,It's a joke because prank is based on a joke that isn't just a joke.
92,80,"I can’t even find it in the title. '‘In all fairness, if the movie was actually a joke, they’d be wrong. I think it’s important to mention that the people that use masks aren’t necessarily smart, they’re just as immature as those who use them.’’"
95,92,"Yes, the movie's title describes a very specific allergy based on the sprite. In general, it's just a joke, and isn't necessarily an a joke, but rather an expression of a a repressed prank. ""How do you know if he's allergic to the virus?"""
92,52,"It was a joke! I don't care what they say, but if they think it's funny then I think it's a joke!"

92,52,My bf had this exact feeling like a child and he thought it was a joke. Then he got off and did a shit-picking joke. He woke up after one of his spooky pranks in school to ask if he was allergic to spit or if it's a joke. He felt bad and his face was sore and he just didn't know he needed to have a prank. So he got off at the spooky joke. It's a joke
92,64,It's not a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.
92,65,It's a joke because it's a joke. ''... and ''if you want to make fun of the prankster'''.
92,80,"I hate to say it, but I've also always liked the title. I don't know why people make fun of me because I have sprite."
95,92,"""I don't know why people are so upset about this. I'm allergic to a virus, and I can't breathe, I can't breathe. I can't breathe. I can't breathe. I can't breathe. I can't breathe. I can’t breathe. I can’t breathe. I can’t breathe. I can’t breathe. I can’t breathe. I can’t breathe. I can’t breathe. I can’t breathe. I can’t breathe."
92,52,"I'm allergic to a lot of things, I'm just a little confused. I've a cold and I don't think it's funny to have a cold so it makes me a little sad, but it just isn't funny."
92,64,"Yes, but the fact that you say it as a joke doesn’t change what I think. It may be funny to you but you can’t be as silly as you thought."
92,65,It's a joke because of its content. A prank isn't a joke because it's a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke.
92,80,"I love 'Pick up'. I've never heard a prank like that on here before and always wanted to try it out but hey there's something else out there that makes me laugh, 'Pick up'."
95,92,I would say that this is one of the best and most interesting pranks of the year.
92,52,"I was just watching a movie where a guy was talking to a friend about his cold and he told me to go get some water and put it on his nose, and then put it on his nose to see what was going on, and he told me he'd suck it up and the friend wouldn't even see anything about it. I looked up a few of these movies on instagram a while ago. Then he told me something about how he'd suck it up and said ""It's a joke, but it'"
92,64,I feel like there's no way I could really be sarcastic without having written a sentence about it. I feel like the first paragraph or two was a bit much if you like it.
92,65,It's a joke because it's a joke.
92,80,I'm not sure how long a joke was and how a joke was written and repressed. It's a joke because it is a joke.
95,92,"This is the first time I've heard the word ""prank"" use in the context of a prank."
