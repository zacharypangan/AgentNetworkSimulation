    "If I told my mom that the \"little blue ones are totally useless.Even the best don't work very well.\" I'd probably get a little apprehensive of my husband putting on the mask.",
    ">Heh, no way. He's wearing a mask because he's a health and safety hazard. They didn't get it in his obituary. He wasn't a scientist, he was a scientist. I've always wondered why someone would say they're allergic to a virus when they have some.",
    "I'm so glad that you're getting the laughs you deserve. You should do this.",
    "I mean, it is a prank - that's why it hasn't been aired.",
    "I think if you were sick, he would get sick just like you would be. It's a joke, and you should get the laughs.",
    "So you can make your own joke about a prank without being allergic to the virus and it is a joke?",
    "I like to think that wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.He's wearing a mask to avoid getting sick, which is a very common thing to do.",
    "i.e. because i'm a human so i don't know how i could tell if i was a prankster or not.",
    "The last line doesn't seem to be an attempt to use the word prank in this context, but rather a a piece of sarcastic criticism from OP's post.",
    "The first sentence is just a little misleading but also unrelated. Having never heard it before, it's sort of as funny as you think it is. It's kind of like the movie The Walking Dead.",
    "If you say that your wife was a prankster, then you are being wrong.",
    "In addition to the other comments in the thread, I found this to be very interesting - this is a story about the fact that one of our professors is a doctor, and the other doctor's job, and that is a very common thing to do. It's funny to think that a person can make a joke that is the same as the jokes they make at work. I wouldn't say you are wrong. Despite the fact that you've seen it, this kind of joke can be kind of funny at times, too. You do",
    "It\u2019s funny that a prankster would do something like this when he was sick but it\u2019s not funny when it\u2019s a prank.",
    "My mom is a big fan of pranks, but I've never heard of anyone telling jokes about pranks, except me. I'm allergic to a lot of viruses, and I am a prankster too, so I guess I should just tell myself what it is.",
    "I've heard a prank about the role of a doctor as a doctor, and it's really hard to know.",
    "That was the point of the post. You're being funny and he's getting the laughs.",
    "a joke is a joke.",
    "I read the title, \"Heh, no way. He's wearing a mask because he's a health and safety hazard. They didn't get it in his obituary. He wasn't a scientist, he was a scientist. I've always wondered why someone would say they're allergic to a virus when they have some.\", \"Well if I had to choose between Maroon and Maroon I would pick a mask over one of these. I'm so glad that you're being funny.",
    "I'm a little worried about my husband. I've heard a lot of \"Potato\" jokes, and I don't know whether I'm being sarcastic or not.",
    "I guess you have to get it right before I'm trying to make fun of someone.",
    "It's a joke to make fun of someone who is allergic to a virus.",
    "I love pranks, but I don't find the point of this post to be as sarcastic as the other comments in the thread.",
    "Having never heard it before, 'I read the title as a joke'.",
    "You've got this... What is the point of having the mask and that? What is your point of having it?",
    "a lot of people think a joke is a joke",
    "In the end, OP's comment was exactly the kind of comment I was expecting.",
    "I'm allergic to many viruses so it's pretty common for me to feel shit putting on a mask to get me to sleep.",
    "I am a professional prankster and I've never had a job that I didn't have a job. Basically, I've never been a prankster.",

    "It's a joke that doesn't work a joke.",
    "''I'm so glad that you're being funny. I'm so glad that you're being funny.",
    "Nope, it's just a joke. I've never heard a joke about a prankster because it's so silly. I've never heard a joke about a prankster. Rather, I know how much I'd say I'm being funny.",
    "I don\u2019t know what a prank is, but this is what I am looking for.",
    "It's not a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke, but it's not a joke.",
    "It doesn't matter if it's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke, but it's not a joke.",

    "It's a joke.",
    "So I read \"It's funny that a person can make a joke about a prank without being allergic to a virus.\" and then I read \"It's funny that a person can make a joke about a joke without being allergic to a virus.\" and finally decided I needed a word.",
    "Its not a joke. It's a joke, but it's not a joke.",
    "\"Pick up\" is an unintentional prank, one in which you're getting shit.",
    "This is a joke, not a prank.",
    "I'm allergic to the most common types of viruses, but I do not think I ever had a chance to find some. My nose doesn't work.",
    "It's not a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.",
    "Yes, but the fact that you say it as a joke doesn\u2019t change what I think. It may be funny to you but you can\u2019t be as silly as you thought.",
    "I feel like there's no way I could really be sarcastic without having written a sentence about it. I feel like the first paragraph or two was a bit much if you like it."
