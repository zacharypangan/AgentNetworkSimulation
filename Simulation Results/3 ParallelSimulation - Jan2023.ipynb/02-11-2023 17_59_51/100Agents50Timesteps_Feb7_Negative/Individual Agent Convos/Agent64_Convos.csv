64,8,I am not sure why you would have resigned so quickly if the government didn't have a public opinion on this. The only reason it doesn't have a public opinion on this is because there is no public opinion on this topic unless it is clear that people do.
64,24,"I'm a coach, I'd like to be able to do this, but I think it may not be very good to work on my personal health. It's actually quite effective. I'm looking forward to the next season."

Having been on the subject since I was a student in college, I've noticed that wearing a mask makes you look more tired than a normal person.

64,46,It's a good thing if I don't wear a mask. It's a bit dangerous.

64,26,The fact that the military is part of the military is a pretty interesting reason for the government to not do it. It is so much harder and expensive than it seems to be.

64,37,I’m pretty sure the government doesn’t just need you to wear a mask.
64,38,"A mask that doesn't protect your mouth can only keep a person from infections, even if their masks are a bit loose."
64,46,"In my state, I believe that a very small percentage of people have an emergency doctor's appointment because they cannot be properly sterilized in their workplaces. I think the average person will be extremely anxious, and even more anxious when they see a doctor. You may be able to avoid this for the rest of your life, but a large majority of people think they're doing something wrong. There's no way you could take the time to go to the hospital and ask about the disease but you do have some very bad healthily."
66,64,"I have a doctor that specializes in all of this stuff and has done a lot of the same stuff. I get a medical certificate, or at least have a good idea of what the laws say about the dangers of drugs. Vaccination is a very important part of prevention, because it's a big part of protecting people from the risk of disease. I don't think any vaccine can stop the spread of that kind of virus. It just doesn't protect the population."

92,64,">Heh, no way. He's wearing a mask because he's a health and safety hazard. They didn't get it in his obituary. He wasn't a scientist, he was a scientist. I've always wondered why someone would say they're allergic to a virus when they have some."

This would be a lot more helpful for them to have in mind when they get sick or sick and have to be vaccinated.
64,46,I'm a medical director. I've had to leave a couple of places to live unless I was in the Army. That is probably why I chose a mask - if the medicine wasn't in my hands I'd probably be in the Army.

64,7,"Well, I don't think there's a lot of evidence to suggest the government is attempting to ""reproduce this disease"", it's just the general idea that the health care system and the government, in this case, are the same thing."
64,8,"I'm very sorry to hear this. I am a doctor and this is a subject that I've always wondered about, and have considered. I am a little paranoid that my husband would get sick in the hospital and need to be vaccinated. My wife is allergic to the AIDS virus.

64,24,"If it's a good idea to prevent the spread of a virus, it's a good idea to put on the mask."
64,26,I get to talk to a lot of people who are not medical professionals.
64,30,"The first few words are about the most common anti-virus slogans a person's mouth has ever heard. The second one is that the people who had an ""infection causing infection"" mentality would probably want to be in the army to get it."
64,35,"In my state, I believe that a very small percentage of people have an emergency doctor's appointment because they cannot be properly sterilized in their workplaces."
64,37,This is a bit of an over the top joke. I wouldn't want to make it seem like I'm trying to make it sound like I'm somehow a bad person. Vaccination is important to protect people from the spread of a virus. I think that's a big part of what is needed besides keeping the vaccines current and infected.

64,30,Isn't a person a medical director? Because if it wasn't a physician there's not much point in asking what they are going to do to protect them. A health professional would want to have a hand in preventing this kind of thing.
64,35,Vaccination is a good way to stop the spread of a virus. I'd put on a mask so you can be vaccinated.
64,37,"The government is making you sick. People need to stop saying they have AIDS. If they have AIDS, they are more likely to get sick. Vaccination is the answer to this problem."

64,24,"Vaccination is an important way to prevent or treat illness, and we need to get vaccines as soon as possible. We can only hope that by the time a vaccine goes out, a large number of people will get sick. It's time to stop fighting the disease."
64,26,"I work for the government but I have had to go through a lot of paperwork with the health care board to find out the best way to stop a virus, and that is the CDC."
64,30,"This is why they are making a joke involving how to tell a joke. This is because it's the joke, and it's why the government makes fun of people who have a problem with the vaccine."
64,35,I'm glad you're not being too literal here. I'm sorry that you're having a bad day today.
64,37,Is it a joke? I'm a medical director and I'm so sorry to say this blew my mind.

64,8,I really appreciate the kind words you've given.
64,24,"People are going to get sick and get a sick hat. They are going to get sick and not get a cure. The problem is getting sick in the long run. If you don't get enough of a cure, you won't be able to keep it. You'll get sick, and then you won't get any better. It's a really, really bad thing to be afraid of."
64,26,Vaccination is one of the many benefits that the government has over its own people.
64,30,The worst thing I've ever heard is that the government is making fun of people who use masks because they want to save their patients. They don't want to waste their time getting a vaccine and are afraid of doing so.
64,35,There's a joke that makes you wear masks and not wear masks for the whole world to see?
64,37,I'm gonna get on the Internet.
64,38,The CDC is probably a little too crappy on it's part because the government is so incompetent.
64,46,This is the kind of thing that'makes' me feel ashamed of all the people who work for the government. Is this a joke?
66,64,"Vaccinations are a great tool for the population. If you haven't seen it yet, it might be a joke."
73,64,I would take your kids to the doctor to find out what you're saying. I think it's very interesting to read that you actually don't get vaccinated. But you are right - it's a joke.

64,26,I've had a few conversations with people who are in the military and I can tell you there are some ridiculous jokes about the ACA.

64,38,It's really not a joke at all.
64,46,There is no reason for the President to put his name in it.
66,64,I've seen a lot of vaccinating videos online. It seems that 'tough' to believe.
73,64,The people who are actually being vaccinated are blaming it on a lie.

64,8,I think this is going to suck as much as I hate if someone tells me how to get a vaccination. Vaccination is a joke in general but it is a joke.
64,24,That's why we don't have any laws about who's a joke'?
64,26,It's not a joke.
64,30,The idea of a joke is a joke. It's funny that the phrase 'I'm just kidding. It's a joke' is misleading. I don't see a difference between a joke and a joke if a joke or joke is to be interpreted as a joke.
64,35,'Vaccination is the best way to stop the spread of a virus. The only way to prevent the spread of the virus is to stop people from getting sick.'
64,37,I’m not saying the ACA is a joke. I’m saying the ACA is an example of the prank that the government should avoid.
64,38,I grew up in the military. I'm not familiar with the ACA. The military has had some of the best programs for vaccines (including one with MMR). But I don't see why this is a joke at all.
64,46,"I know a lot of pranksters, some of whom are claiming that the ACA isn't a joke, but you're right that it is a joke - that's not a really good idea."

64,35,"People with pneumonia are going to wear masks. A few weeks ago, the hospital staff told me they don't like wearing them. It took them six months to get into hospital to get their patient vaccinated. The next day, we told them to wear masks to keep their patients away from the virus."
64,37,So when people are getting sick and don't get vaccines that means the government is attempting to censor you from all the other people and censoring you?
64,38,Vaccination is a joke because it is a good thing for the nation and the military.
64,46,"I work in the medical field, and I work in the military. The ACA is a joke and this is not one of them. I'm afraid we've got it down voted in our department. But I can't stand it."

64,26,"...It's a joke. The ACA is a joke because it keeps people from getting sick, because vaccines are the way to go. It's a joke that the government is trying to control and protect people by taking care of the health care costs of people without the right to receive a protection."
64,30,I'm pretty sure the whole joke is just a joke.
64,35,The issue in the video is not the “stupid government” being a joke but the lack of the “stupid” being a joke.

64,26,"There are people who voted for the ACA as the most dangerous in America and as long as they have some legal right to know that they are not getting anything done, that is not a joke. They may be looking for some other joke and this isn't it. They are just not going to fix the problem."
