    "I'm not sure what to think of the CDC, but it doesn't appear that they are actually working against the spread of viruses. It's an interesting fact, I think, that a lot of people have never heard of such a thing. It's not like the CDC is trying to do a real or a true job of protecting kids from an unknown infection, but essentially trying to prevent a disease.",
    "...a joke? Yes, and that's the joke.",

    "I got a virus because my mother told me it was on my head and on my nose. After about a month or two I lost a mask and was vaccinated and then a month later when I was vaccinated again, I lost a mask a little bit. I was told it isn't the best way to protect against the spread of a virus, and that that part was about the CDC vs the CDC. I was given an actual CDC certificate to be vaccinated and was then allowed to get a lot of the vaccine because",

    "The CDC will not allow you to be in a joke or it will not be a joke.",
    "I've had a pretty good experience on the subject and I've always been so proud of the guy who put his mask on. He was absolutely hilarious. He is the kind of person who can make fun of the CDC without causing anyone any trouble - and even if he isn't, I think his mask is actually pretty hysterical. He could have put it on if he were a doctor, and he would have given it to someone if he was a doctor.",
    "I don\u2019t want to be in a joke. It isn\u2019t a joke. It\u2019s a joke.",

    ">As I read the article says he had a lot of rules about wearing the masks - and what they do with them is the most accurate explanation for why the rules are in place - and if they aren\u2019t followed - they must have some way of getting\u2019, \u2019I\u2019m not sure how it compares to what i read in the sub and how it makes sense.',"
