98,87,The government is supposed to support people who are going to go out with friends and they want to talk about how good it is. They do not get to spend hours and hours on drugs.

98,87,"I'm just saying, I'm very comfortable in bed, and I have to get my face clean, and take a few shots to avoid the sexy funk that is the new and improved version of my sexy one."

98,87,"Having said that, I'm not sure that anyone would be able to tell you exactly what it says in the context of these two sentences."
98,87,I've tried wearing my mask a lot but I don't feel comfortable at all.
98,87,I have been on a diet a few times.
98,87,"I know someone who lost a mask at 14 and gave me a new one in December. He told me I had to go to the doctor and give it a try. It worked perfectly and I am now having fun in the morning.

98,87,"I'm not sure I understand what's going on. Honestly, I don't think it's a miracle that you're not having fun."
98,87,"I went to the doctors last week with a guy who lost a mask, he said he was trying to cut a mask off and he asked him if he could help me lose my mask, he said no, and he told me he was gonna cut it off because he is a fool."
