54,13,i m going to say this about twitchcon and masks you can hate me if the state town doesn t have an mandates you can t get mad that an event doesn t not sure if sd has any mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask

67,13,oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that
80,13,i love coaching however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops
91,13,I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam.
13,2,The guy in the photo posted the fact that there are only a few people in this thread who are able to tell me it's a scam.
13,3,I'm not sure if you have had the opportunity to try out a mask if your face didn't look like a mask.
13,8,The gov is invading the restaraunt and this isn't a good idea.
43,13,...because you fucking have no choice but to wear a mask? What the fuck?!
54,13,"Then why is the media reliant on your mask? Are you going to pay for it? That s a big cliche, but it is the same with masks that are required for every member of society to wear them and it is not a law."
56,13,You're saying that the government is the one that can stop the spread of the virus?
61,13,I'm not going to take the job stymied unless I wear a mask. I don't want to be a sick squatter with the vaccinated vaccine I have.
67,13,I know you're not a good coach. But it's pretty much like a rule at a club - no one wants to have to go through that.
80,13,"If he doesn't like the way people say he's on the internet that he shouldn't wear a mask, he should just get a restraining order."
91,13,"The government is very careful to keep people from wearing masks. That's why they wear masks at all times, as a way to prevent the spread of a virus."
13,2,The mask is required by the states.
13,3,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i ve done in my entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things Little blue ones are totally useless.Even the best don't work very well.Even the best don't work very well.Events

43,13,"I'm not the one that is ranting about the mask issue, I'm the one that is being debunked by some people. The NSA is basically threatening and infecting people with the virus. And they don't even have the right to resign."
54,13,You think there is a problem here?
56,13,"Apparently, the Government is doing the right thing when a sick person is not wearing a mask, iirc."
61,13,"I have been vaccinated by a reputable organization, vaccinating my daughter, and she had two years of vaccine therapy. And a few years ago, I lost my vaccination, and I had to put on a mask. A guy on a train left me and was scared for my life. Then I asked him to cut his head off and tell him ""NEVER ever get sick again!"". He told me it was because he couldn't get sick and he tried to scream ninja ninja ninja."
67,13,"So your team has been wearing masks since then, right?"
80,13,"I'm really tired of wearing masks, but I think I could go buy a new one. And I'm sure a new one would be a lot better."
91,13,"And this is how you can vaccinate someone with a virus and keep them from seeing the doctor. I'm not sure you're being sarcastic, but you've done things like a lot of stupid things."
13,2,"The thing is, the NSA is a terrible organisation. They lied about the facts. And it's a great idea. It's also a good way to protect people from the bad things people will say and get caught."
13,3,"I would be more of a cliche to say that they are the ""stymies"" of the government, but that they are still using a mask. You say you are sick and the people who are being raped are the ones who are being debunked by some people? If you don't know the facts then I don't see any problems with that."
13,8,"It's been a while, oh, and they need to get the right one."
43,13,I'm in a doctor's office. It's just part of the anti-virus movement. The vaccinations are a problem.
54,13,"As a kid, I thought the joke was just a joke."
56,13,"I see you figured out your question, and so did you. It's possible the CDC is trying to sabotage the spread of a virus by disallowing a person to put on a mask at the first sign of a sick person. So here you are, trying to give some perspective on how to stop the spread of the virus."
61,13,I have a facial hair mask. It's not a mask.
67,13,What if your coach is wearing a mask so they can breathe?
80,13,"I'm sorry a lot of this happens to you. I hate shit like this on tv. I'm not even a fan of it, especially not what people are saying about me. Besides if there isn't any information out there on the topic, if there is then I would not be able to help you. Hopefully this helps you, and the fact that you're a troll is why this thread is going to be downvoted so much. This post is just a joke."
91,13,The article says they have a lot of rules about wearing masks - and what they do with them is the most accurate explanation for why the rules are in place - and if they aren't followed - they must have some way of getting them to pass tests.
13,2,"I'm not a racist, but if you were a kid and thought they were making fun of the NSA, you'd be dead wrong."
13,3,I have one of the only people I care about. I work in an anti-virus community and have done many other things to prevent it from spread.
13,8,The article said that they have a lot of rules about wearing masks - and what they do with them is the most accurate explanation for why the rules are in place - and if they aren't followed - they must have some way of getting them to pass tests.
43,13,I'd be extremely pissed.
54,13,And you’re saying that the CDC doesn’t enforce mandatory vaccinations?
56,13,This is how I look at it. I'm a big fan of the anti-vaccine nonsense of it.
61,13,There are other ways to say that.
67,13,"I would be willing to bet you are a bad coach. If you genuinely want to quit, you aren't going to have to do that, and you have to be on the same page as every other student in your department and to have the same attitude towards the new players."
80,13,...that's what the title says and I would like to say. Isn't wearing a mask part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus?
91,13,"""I wear a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam. Unless you're playing football in a club with no sassy coach on the other hand, then putting on a mask is an incredibly dangerous and unnecessary tactic, as you'd be surprised if people would get away with it."""
13,2,You might be able to explain some of the arguments here to OP and other users.
13,3,So... The CDC is trying to sabotage the spread of a virus by disallowing a person to put on a mask at the first sign of a sick person.
13,8,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.The thing is, the NSA is a terrible organisation. They lied about the facts. And it's a good idea. It's also a good way to protect people from the bad things people will say and get caught."
43,13,Basically speaking the NSA has no legal obligation to protect players if the government decides to harmed their cause. I’m not sure the issue stands today but it will continue to accustom players and officials to their own medical advice.
54,13,If you want to live in the world where people are going to do things you are not allowed to.
56,13,>I think it's a great idea to try something new with my mom if she can get the help she needs from someone who knows her way around the virus. It's the only cure.
61,13,"That's a pretty good point about trying to hide it, especially when people are going to be doing it on the side of the road."
67,13,The first person to ask about this is not the first person. I was told that wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
80,13,You are putting on a show about the spread of a viral infection in the US vs. the US. This isn't about the government. This is about the world's greatest 'canonical virology' and that's a pretty obvious thing to do.
91,13,The article said he had a lot of rules about wearing masks - and what they do with them is the most accurate explanation for why the rules are in place - and if they aren't followed - they must have some way of getting them to pass tests.
13,2,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I'm not a racist, but if you were a kid and thought they were making fun of the NSA, you'd be dead wrong."
13,3,I think 'putting on a mask at the first sign of a sick person' sounds pretty good. But it's not about sabotage... it's about preventing it from spreading.
13,8,You do realize they're trying to have some sort of restraining order on them.
43,13,I can't tell you what the big deal is with the NSA. They don't have to protect players and officials.
54,13,"""I feel like there are people on the street that say ""wow, people don't like your jokes"" or something. I get that people just don't care if you're a criminal. I feel like if I were a criminal I wouldn't even care. I'm not even a criminal. I'm not even a criminal because my life is so crazy and horrible, and I've got it for about an hour. I'm not even a political or professional. I'm a a clichsy."
56,13,"This has nothing to do with a mask, it’s the CDC’s role in protecting the public, which is to be a ""doctor's job"" and not a doctor’s office. The public is not the agency responsible for vaccines, it is the agency."
61,13,What's weird is the idea that TWickCon is the only place to get into the weeds here.
67,13,"You're not being harsh. You are not talking about the government in a way that should be understood. Unless you were to agree to a compromise, or a compromise, that is not appropriate. And you are assuming that this is not the situation he's referring to. It's not as if he didn't make the right decision and he is trying to tarnish the situation by simply putting yourself in a position that they won't have to accept, which is what the government's doing. If you are willing to stand up for yourself"
80,13,"I am not even sure why they say ""failures"" when people say ""sorry"" when they are not a bit of a doctor."
91,13,Vaccination is an essential part of protecting against any disease.
13,2,"As others have said, the NSA is a terrible organisation, but their restraining order is a bit of a naivete."
13,3,"I believe that the US has a good number of national anti-virus vaccination programs in place, with a number of similar ones."
13,8,"You're a criminal, and you're not racist."
43,13,"...I grew up with the CDC and the NFL. My father is a teacher. My mom and a friend are all college students, and the kids get their own vaccines. My father is a doctor and their children are not too many years older than me. I'm a little bit ashamed that they don't want my dad to be able to bring me to work."
54,13,It is a cliche to assume that people who don't wear masks actually wear masks because they are not going to be able to tell whether or not to make them.
56,13,> I've tried wearing a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam. I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam. I lose a mask at least four times a day.
61,13,What is not a meme? It's a joke.
67,13,"I think you're missing the point. ""He's a shady coach and he is not interested in this game."""
80,13,What would a person say if a doctor said something that was a joke?
91,13,"The article is based off of a very misleading and misleading article that is based on an ad hominem that is the government's newest, most infamous, propaganda slogan. It's basically a bunch of jokes that are just a bunch of ad hominems."
13,2,People who don't wear a mask are not aware of the fact that they are NSA. They are using the NSA as a means to protect the public and thus provide a safety net for people who are not a health professional.
13,3,You are not being harsh. You are just being a clichsy.

43,13,"The biggest threat is when a player gets fucked and they can't even tell the truth, so it's up to them to find an alternative."
54,13,"Because people are supposed to be the ones deciding what they want, and not deciding what they want."
56,13,"The question is, why doesn't he just buy the mask?"
61,13,I think you're a fucking idiot if you have a mask on. I wouldn't be surprised if your mom would be blaming your narwhal.
67,13,"It's not the CDC, it's the CDC and the Department of Defense and the CDC does nothing to stop the spread of a virus."
80,13,"I'm not sure what your point is here, but I'm also not sure what's really going on with the CDC's stance. What would a doctor say in an interview if a doctor said something that was a joke?"
91,13,"It's a bit of a weird thing to say, but the whole thing is just BS."
13,2,The NSA does NOT use the NSA to protect the public because it is not a legitimate threat.
13,3,"You're right. I think it's funny to say that these aren't in the US, but that the US doesn't have the same amount of security protections that the rest of the country has, especially the US."
13,8,I am a medical student. I have a doctor that is a professor at the University of Kentucky. I was a medical student and was a student at the CDC. I also have a teacher and two teachers. I also have a brother that is a medical student and is a physician. So I can see that. I have been a medical student for a year. The professor at the CDC was the student's mother. The professor at my school told me that my dad is an ivy and that he is a doctor. I can see that
43,13,There are two sides to this. One is a joke about an anti-virus vaccine that supposedly was invented by an American. The other is that the CDC is trying to prove that they are racist and that they should put in place a legal safeguard.
54,13,Vaccination is a good way to prevent the spread of HIV in the US.
56,13,I don't know what this is about but I know how you are dealing with the government. It doesn't sound like they're hysterical or just saying it's illegal. It sounds like there's a lot of misinformation on the internet.
61,13,I have to admit that I think this is actually a funny post. It doesn't even say anything about the government in a very good way.
67,13,I'm surprised there isn't a lot of people who wear masks because they believe that people don't want to come up with an excuse for not wearing them at the game.
80,13,"Vaccines can be dangerous. If you don't want to get vaccinated, you don't want to get the vaccine, you want to die, you want to die. You want to be safe? You don't want to die if you don't want to die, but you want to die."
91,13,"""This whole thing is a scam."""
13,2,"Is that what they're supposedly saying about the CDC, or is the CDC trying to convince other health professionals that a vaccine is a good idea?"
13,3,Yes. The whole thing is a scam.

13,2,'The other is that the CDC is trying to convince other health professionals that a vaccine is a good idea?
13,3,"People putting on masks is not really a scam. I’d say there’s probably a lot of fake news around here about the CDC and the CDC’s anti-viral vaccine programs. If they’re going to sabotage the spread of HIV, it’s important for them to inform people that you’re being raped and are not getting the vaccine. If they’re going to use it as an excuse to get sick, I’d think it’s not a scam."
13,8,The first point of the article is that the NSA used to impede the spread of a virus (it wasn't actually a legitimate threat) but has been used as a tool by a number of individuals in the past to help prevent and deter spreading a virus.
