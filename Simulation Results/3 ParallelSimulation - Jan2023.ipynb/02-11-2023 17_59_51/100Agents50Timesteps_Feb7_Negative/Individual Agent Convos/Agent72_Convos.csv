82,72,"The state of Texas does not do mandates for vaccinated people with boosters for a mask at TWitchCon and other events, so the only reason the state does is because they aren't allowed to have a mandate."
84,72,There is a lot of evidence that the mask is the only way to prevent the spread of a virus
90,72,"The only way to prevent it is to cut it off, and then use an eye mask, or even a bare skin one."
72,2,"The CDC has the authority to tell me whether people need to wear a mask to prevent the spread of viruses, or to not wear masks because of health or safety concerns. In my country, it's pretty sexist to allow people to wear masks to prevent them from putting on any kind of medical equipment."

But I also know that it makes no sense unless the guy doesn't talk about it too much, or some guy doesn't seem to understand what he's saying. You know, that the world would be better without it."

72,21,> Where do I sign up to be a commissioner for a hs or hs hs team?
72,24,The hivemind is going to say the same thing. I have a question. Why did the ebola virus break out in my state?
72,25,"The only way to prevent the spread of a virus is to cut it off, and then use an eye mask, or even a bare skin one."
72,26,"When you ask the question ""Are you allowed to wear masks because of a safety concern? "" they respond ""No!"" and say ""No"" or ""Ok you can't"" then they say ""No""."
72,33,Is this in fact true? I’ve never seen a picture of a people being ripped off of a mask.
72,34,"What's the point of a mask if he doesn't have it, and what is it for when he wears a mask?"
72,35,Are they the kind of people that like to play politics with masks and they're in the same political party?
72,38,"The most important thing to consider about all of these are the ones that don't say ""Madness is good for you"" as in ""I don't think I need to wear a mask, because I need to wear something good for you""."
72,41,I don't like how we were told the first time the president voted for me. Now I don't care. I've lost several months.
72,54,"I don't know much about the vaccine issue, but the federal government seems like a good idea. The federal government has no right to wear a mask, and I know what you mean about being ""ask him what he likes."""
72,57,We're not allowed to make any decisions at all.
72,68,"So basically, if you want to go get vaccines, you have to go. You might want to go to an OTC or Health Department for example. It's not like that a whole lot of people here have no idea what a virus is, but they're all trying to make sure that you're getting them in."
72,70,I lost a mask two years ago and it still is a mask for a newbie.
73,72,You are not the OP. This is a scam.
74,72,"I'm not sure if you know /u/tsohpytte is talking about the use of the word that in the text is a part of the act that was implemented, but the text is in a little context."
76,72,I've also done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask
77,72,"It's really not a scam, its a scam to sell a lot of things, so it's a lot of things."
82,72,The CDC isn't denying this. You're using a word and a phrase that's slang for “seen” or “seen” in any other language.
84,72,Its not like the President is trying to shut down the spread of a virus.
90,72,It's a common misconception that putting on a mask makes you more likely to die of it. There's no reason for her to do it.
72,2,"Vaccines are a common problem here in the US, you can't get a good enough dose."
72,6,"You know, there's one point in politics:"
72,8,"Unless you're a Republican, it seems unlikely. I lied to this person and I didn't answer that. Then I asked him ""why do you wear a mask?"""
72,9,This is a scam. What the fuck is the point of getting an unmasked one?
72,11,"Yes, they say this is true."
72,15,"I'm so glad you're not in a pathetic position. We can make the government better! We aren't allowed to give you advice. We can't use a mask or say anything. If you don't like it, don't go to a CDC or any other healthcare authority."
72,19,We have all been there. This is about being a safety-conscious asshole who only has the right to do what is necessary for the protection of our health. The government must take responsibility and control for the protections that people wear in the event of a deadly disease.
72,21,"There is a federal government that can do anything. If it isn't in your state, you need to go to your county health department to get a new one."
72,24,I am just a guy who is a doctor who has to get the vaccine and not get the full vaccine.
72,25,"It is a scam. It isn't just an anti-viral bill slander. It is not illegal, but it's illegal in the US to keep a child on the street while the president is on the phone."
72,26,"No, if she didn't wear a mask to be infected or die, she'd likely be a big dick."
72,33,I am not sure if I understand this correctly but this is actually the type of person that would be in the hivemind that would think I should have an ebola helmet.
72,34,"So you're describing the situation in this thread, you're the CDC."
72,35,I do not believe it is a scam.
72,38,"If the people are being treated like children by the government, the government has a right to prevent the spread of a virus."
72,41,I do not agree with the above statement. The government does not have the right to enforce any health laws and it is not just for a reason.
72,54,This is a real problem in the political arena.
72,57,I think the most important thing you need to consider is that the masks are a scam to make people afraid to get in in public.
72,68,">Where do I sign up to be a commissioner for a hs or hs hs team? The hivemind is going to say the same thing. I have a question. Why did the ebola virus break out in my state? The only way to prevent the spread of a virus is to cut it off, and then use an eye mask, or even a bare skin one. When you ask ""Are you allowed to wear a mask because of a safety concern? """
72,70,This is not what the CDC is trying to do. It is a joke. They're not trying to be more helpful. They want the public to know what the vaccine is.
73,72,>I've found there is a special kind of mask that keeps you from touching things that might be infected. It's not worth it. It's a form of mask. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
74,72,> wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus....
76,72,"So we're having a conversation about ""putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when I get to my table is one of the dumbest things things things i've done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things"" with the guys at this event?"
77,72,"I'm a CIA agent, and I lost a mask about four times a day for the first time. I lost a mask about three times a day because I didn't know what a NSA scanner looked like."
82,72,"This is one of those things where it's obvious to me that this guy is going to start a show or even a conversation about vaccines and then get involved with TWitchCon. So what if he isn't a good idea and isn't getting vaccinations. That's what makes it a bad idea and he's essentially saying that if he doesn't make a point about it, he might be trying to get in trouble, but that he isn't trying to get an implausible and stupid statements that"
84,72,It's been on my list of things to do.
90,72,"It seems like the fact that you are going to die will never help, but you will still be living. That's a fact. It will be hard for her to get away with this, and I'm sure she'll get the whole thing away."
72,2,"> What's your name, in your country, if I am a politician?"
72,6,"And this isn't a post about vaccinations, it's a post about the shit on twitch."
72,8,"I am not sure if this is true, but the whole ebola joke would be great for the NSA to annoy the public and then the CDC."
72,9,I think that this is the most important thing the CDC needs to consider. I think the most important thing you need to consider is that the masks are a scam to make people afraid to get in in public.
72,11,"No, it is a false statement."
72,15,Are you sure that your insurance company will pay for a vaccination and not go to your local health department?
72,19,He's essentially saying that he doesn't have a right to be a safety-conscious asshole. He has the right to say he has the right to be in the hivemind about preventing spread of a virus. This is a real problem in the political arena.
72,21,You are a very smart dude.
72,24,It seems like a silly question.
72,25,You don't have to be a President to have a safe stance on the CDC's threat of HIV/AIDS. That would be a fucking problem.
72,26,"I can't help but think that they're probably talking about the fact that the hivemind is using it as a ""hivemind"", as opposed to an actual threat to the hivemind because they're talking about the dangers of the hivemind."
72,33,"I was the governor of Washington DC, I thought I'd see this on TV when I walked into the White House."
72,34,"I'd go to TWitchCon and say if I'm going to go, I don't want the government to come on your behalf."
72,35,Vaccines are used to prevent the spread of the virus.
72,38,He is trying to get the CDC to re-certify that all people who are not aware of the vaccinations have them and they do not have to wear them. They are just attempting to help the public.
72,41,"He's also gonna use a mask to try to get to the hospital. So he's going to try to get a new mask to wear? I mean, he was gonna put on a mask for a few hours a day and then use a mask to get around?"
72,54,"I'd call it the ""real problem"" because people think it's the most appropriate thing to do."
72,57,Taking off the mask isn't a bad idea. Its a good idea because the masks are meant to prevent ebola from spreading.
72,68,>I've found there is a special kind of mask that keeps you from touching things that might be infected. It's not worth it. It's a form of mask. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
72,70,"It would be a great thing if they were all talking about that, they just couldn't see where it'd go. It's like saying ""why are you in the hivemind?"" when it comes to a health issue. It's a good thing it's not a joke. The fact that you're saying it's a scam is a huge deal. It's a waste of resources to make a blunder."
73,72,Vaccinating against the virus is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
74,72,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I'm just joking, because I don't like wearing my mask. And then you are gonna say ""I've heard this before....""... He just has an allergy. It’s not like he knows what a cold is, it’s a flu. Obviously he has asthma. The best way to prevent the spread of a virus is to get everyone who does not know how to re-wearing masks."
76,72,"I was asked what a good person Maroon would wear to protect herself from this virus, because it is very common. I asked what he thinks, because he knows it is the most dangerous. I went and talked to him, and I asked him what he thinks. Maroon said he didn't like wearing a mask, but that was my understanding."
77,72,I know this. I'm sure the government has seen this before.
82,72,I'm not saying that I think he's a troll. This is an agnostic argument.
84,72,There is a lot of evidence that the mask is the only way to stop the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
90,72,"I don't know why this is a great post, but [Ms. Ingraham] is not a member of the FDA. There's a difference between a troll and a narcissist who isn't actually actually racist. She’s not gonna have a good time because it’s not ok for her to have sex and leave the state. I mean I’d probably kill her if she had been arrested for it and not her. I think this is an interesting theory about the relationship between a terrorist"
72,2,People need to be aware of the dangers of the hivemind.
72,6,"It's not that the media is fucking up, but they are just trying to make a joke out of what isn't the real thing."
72,8,That isn't a good joke. It's a terrible joke.
72,9,I think he wants a hive mind to stop the spread of the disease.

I mean I’d probably kill her if she had been arrested for it and not her. I think this is an interesting theory about the relationship between a terrorist and a politician.
72,15,He wants the government to tell him he isn't on the right track to take him to the CDC.
72,19,"I don't know why this is a great post, but [Ms. Ingraham] is not a member of the FDA. There's a lot of evidence that the mask is the only way to stop the spread of a virus."
72,21,"I don't think you know much about the topic, but the CDC says that wearing a mask is helping prevent the spread of a virus. The CDC has already said that vaccinations are necessary to prevent the spread of the virus. The CDC is also claiming that HIV/AIDS is not part of the virus and is trying to discourage the spreading of the virus."
72,24,There's a difference between a troll and a racist.
72,25,You don't have to be a member of the FDA to have a safe stance on the CDC's threat of HIV/AIDS. That would be a fucking problem.
72,26,Why does Hillary Bush know this?
72,33,The guy has already gone on to become the next President.
72,34,"This isn't about the govt, it's about the govt. that makes things up a lot. The govt can get a hold of things to do and go after people with HIV/AIDS."
72,35,"""I don't like wearing my mask."""
72,38,Why not wear a mask to prevent the spread of a virus?
72,41,"""I think that wearing a mask is the best way to stop the spread of a virus. You are a very smart dude. It seems like a silly question. You don't have to be a President to have a safe stance on the CDC's threat of HIV/AIDS. That would be a fucking problem."

72,57,>> Why are you resigning? Getting a mask is a scam.
72,68,"No, he's not a member of the CDC and you have no idea what he's talking about. That's his job."
72,70,I was a Republican candidate in the 2016 election and was told the vaccines are the only effective way to stop the spread of the virus.
73,72,Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of the virus. Please wear masks.

76,72,It's not just a scam. It's a scam.
77,72,I'm a CIA agent and I've lost my first mask when I was a kid.
82,72,Isn't a man wearing a mask illegal or a troll?
84,72,The mask thing is not just a scam. Its part of the plan and the main purpose of vaccination.
90,72,...And the fact that a billion people live in the US doesn't make me think that I'm right. It seems like the only thing that people need to do is to wear a mask.
72,2,"Vaccines are a common problem here in the US, you can't get a good enough dose. In my country, it's pretty sexist to allow people to wear masks to prevent them from putting on any kind of medical equipment."
72,6,I see that this was a joke from Obama.
72,8,[President Clinton]. Ingraham's stance is more to do with being a senator from Chicago than his own stance. I guess we're just talking about the same things the CDC is trying to do with people with HIV/AIDS.
72,9,"If he's gonna be a good candidate to run for President, he's going to have to do something stupid."
72,11,There are a few things in the article:
72,15,They are telling us the truth and I don't think they are even able to make them aware.
72,19,You are telling the truth? This is about preventing the spread of a virus.
72,21,"I've a friend who is a medical professional who doesn't get the vaccines. She's wearing one, and she can't wear a mask. And she's not a medical doctor, so she's not legally entitled to wear one."
72,24,"[Trump said it's ok not to wear a mask, and Ingraham said it's restricting our rights to keep us locked inside. You know our right to die and infect (kill) others. Why isn't Ms. Ingraham out there with them."", 'The hivemind is going to say the same thing. I have a question. Why did the ebola virus break out in my state?', 'I am just a guy who is a doctor who has to get the vaccine and not get the full vaccine"
72,25,">Why are you resigning? Getting a mask is not just a scam. No, he's not a member of the CDC and you have no idea what he's talking about."
72,26,Because it's not about the govt. the govt. that makes things up a lot.
72,33,Yes he does. And he was a Republican and a Democrat. And then he was the Republican candidate who is now the Democrat presidential candidate.
72,34,This is not an untrue fact. This is just one of those stories.
72,35,Vaccines are used to prevent the spread of the virus. It is the best way to stop the spread of the virus. Please wear a mask.
72,38,They're merely attempting to prevent the spread of the virus by allowing people to get them. Ingraham is trying to prevent people from getting HIV. It's not just about a scam. It's a scam.
72,41,>The guy has already gone on to become the next president.
72,54,"Well, I don't really think it's a scam. I'm a doctor so I think it's a little funny that it's an illegal thing to wear a mask and it's not a good idea for anybody to take it off. It sounds like a lot of people actually think it's a scam, but this is one of those things that everyone's talking about."
72,57,"It's like the NSA is trying to sell a medical device that can prevent HIV/AIDS and the people who are infected with it, but it's not gonna stop the spread of it. It's the only way to prevent HIV/AIDS."
72,68,I have not read this story. It sounds like he is very confused with the facts.
72,70,"It's a scam to be sure, but it's a scam to believe someone is saying what they're talking about."
73,72,"I think this is the most funny part, but I do like the joke that they want the NFL to get rid of the masks because there's a difference in how much people care and how it's funny. Having a bad game is really not going to solve this problem."
74,72,They're the first to say it's illegal.
76,72,"""I have done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask"""
77,72,CIA agents do not wear masks when a person is sick. They wear masks to protect themselves. They wear masks to protect themselves and others.
82,72,"I mean, you don't know what a lawyer is but the facts are a lot clearer. You can't really be a lawyer but you can always be a lawyer. The guy is saying that the guy is not quite the president he is. I'm gonna guess that he isn't quite the president he is. I think we all know the issue here. ""I think a person can go to twitchcon without a mask, and it i don't think he's a troll."" The CDC does"
84,72,I'm confused because of the title. I didn't want to know what it was but I could tell it's not even a scam.
90,72,So you're saying that it's a joke and that people shouldn't wear masks in public? That it's in public? No? What's the point?
72,2,"The CDC has the authority to tell me whether people need to wear a mask to prevent the spread of viruses, or to not wear masks because of health or safety concerns."
72,6,">You know, there's one point in politics:"
72,8,I don't have much sympathy for anyone but I do know the CDC is trying to push for more infected people to wear the masks. They need to know about it.
72,9,I'm a doctor. I know how to make up jokes and I've had a bunch of shit to do.
72,11,The NSA doesn't know what a terrorist is. But it's also not the president in the country it's a politician who is trying to prevent HIV/AIDS from spreading.
72,15,It's a joke.
72,19,What is a joke? Does the president know if there's a legitimate threat to preventing the spread of a virus? What are the rumors that he's trying to sell this to?
72,21,">I think a person can go to twitchcon without a mask, and it i don't think he's a troll."""
72,24,"Are you serious? You can resign because you're a doctor, even if it is illegal to wear a mask. The hivemind is going to say the same thing. It sounds like a joke, and if you're serious, they're going to go to a doctor's office and have a medical examination."
72,25,This is one of the most funny parts of the whole post.
72,26,"This isn't a story, it's a joke."

72,41,"The only thing I think is hilarious is the fact that ""Twitchcon"" is the largest event in the history of politics. It's a show promoting propaganda."
72,54,Why does a person not want to wear a mask in public?
72,57,I think the issue here is that the masks were just used for a certain reason. This is a joke.
72,68,He is trying to force you to wear a mask. Then he uses a face mask that prevents you from touching things that might be infected. It's not a good idea for anybody to take it off.
72,70,I'm not saying a person should wear a mask. I'm just saying that the reason the CDC is trying to prevent it is that people aren't allowed to be in public and they have done some pretty stupid stupid things. And I'm just saying that's all it is.

72,26,It's a joke. People hating the government are being the victims of this fucking virus.

72,15,There is a reason you have so little understanding of health and what your government does. But if your government is really trying to prevent it from being more effective then it is going to have some effect in the future.

72,54,Honestly. It sounds like a very big conspiracy to me that this is about 'the President' going to snoop on the CDC for a mask in public.
72,57,People just say it’s a joke. The CDC’s actions are in the name of protecting public health and keeping it a secret and not for making people afraid of getting in public.

74,72,It would seem that in the USA if you don't want to wear a mask you have to keep one. In my country a mask doesn't actually actually prevent anything. You have to go to a doctor and tell them to be aware of what they are doing.

72,11,The article also points out that a virulent virus is actually a joke because it's a legitimate threat. Vaccination is the best way to stop the spread of the virus.
72,15,You're not a joke. You're just an idiot.
72,19,Is there a video on TV showing the doctor wearing a mask and a man doing the sneezing?
72,21,That's a pretty stupid thing to say.
72,24,... that's the only one I can think of to answer what you're saying here.
72,25,He's talking about people who don't have a mask to stop the spread of the virus. This guy is making up a joke.
72,26,It's a joke. Vaccinating against AIDS is the only way to stop the spread of a virus.
72,33,"I have an article on this that says that the people who are doing this is being told that the government is trying to keep their job because it is bad. It's pretty clear that there are people who are in danger of getting a health care situation and if someone wants to give them a health care facility, they will need a licensed doctor to do it. This is a good joke to be able to start with."
72,34,The most important part of this was the government being a troll.
72,35,"That's because he said ""it's ok not to wear mask, and Ingraham said it's restricting our rights to keep us locked inside."" He's not trying to make the president think otherwise, and is trying to create a ""safety feature"" for us. That's also a joke."
72,38,Vaccination is a joke. It's a joke. But a joke.
72,41,"The CDC has made a huge mistake by doing something that people are not doing. Isn't it funny that the ""trolls"" are using it as a joke to try to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS. They're trying to get the CDC's own insurance to help prevent that. Isn't it funny that people are going to a show and talk about the CDC trying to do something for the public good?"
72,54,That's pretty common for a guy who can't stand a mask.
72,57,The article's title is misleading. I think the question is what is being asked?
72,68,It was just a joke.
72,70,"This is an awful piece of shit. I'm so sorry that you are going through this. It's not a joke, that's a joke."
73,72,It's a joke because the CDC isn't even on the receiving end of the problem. Vaccination is a joke because it's illegal to take people to hospitals where it's illegal to handle that issue. So the US will take a similar approach to stop the spread of a virus. There are very few facts that the government was allowed to do.
74,72,"I'm not sure if you have any idea what the term ""importance"" means. I think the actual intent of the word ""importance"" is to be a bit of an ass. And in order to say ""I'm not sure if you know /u/tsohpytte is talking about the use of the word that in the text is a part of the act that was implemented, but the text is in a little context."""
76,72,It sounds like you've had multiple concussions.
77,72,"The most interesting thing is that the CDC has only said that if you have a mask in your hand, you must take your gloves off because you are trying to cut off the possibility of getting a contaminated piece of equipment. That is, you can wear them."
82,72,[I'm going to say this about twitchcon and masks you can hate me if the state town doesn't have any mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask
84,72,I was told a while back that you wear a mask for your dicks? It's more like a safety precaution for people with a mask.
90,72,Why is the NSA putting on a mask?
72,2,"Yes. We need the CDC to act as a ""hibernator"" when we go to the CDC. It's really the only way to prevent a virus spread."
72,6,"So if people aren't comfortable with vaccines or with an infection, they are going to have to wear masks?"
72,8,I'm a medical professional. I wear a mask for work.
72,9,"""I think it is a joke because the CDC has made a huge mistake by doing something that people are not doing."""
72,11,>The article also points out that a virulent virus is actually a legitimate threat. Vaccination is the best way to stop the spread of the virus.
72,15,The whole thing is a'snoop' with the US government and it is a BS/Bulletin.
72,19,"I've always found the whole 'asshole thing' that President Obama and all of us all hate about this to be a troll, especially since we're all trying to get some sort of security clearance for a virus, a big red flag. And then a few times I've actually got to look up all the fake medical data on a certain sneezing or sneezing topic for the first time, and this sneezing sneezing or sneezing thing in the NSA"
72,21,he's a racist
72,24,They could also put on a helmet and be able to do all the restraining orders and restraining orders that people can do and it's a pretty important thing to put on in case of a crisis.
72,25,"I've been at a few meetings where I don't need a mask. I have a mask that prevents me from touching a weapon or weapon and that is not a safety feature. You have a face mask that prevents you from touching things infected. If you don't have one, that's not a safety feature. This is a joke."
72,26,"No, not a joke. Vaccinating against AIDS is the best way to stop the spread of a virus."
72,33,"If you're really not into jokes, if you do it, it isn't really a joke."
72,34,The CDC is doing this for everyone.
72,35,Vaccination is a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke.
72,38,"As someone who has been vaccinated, this is so common and very very hard to avoid."
72,41,...And I'm not sure if people are saying that this is funny or not. I just don't think people are saying that this is funny or not.
72,54,Vaccination is the only way to stop the spread of a virus.
72,57,"Vaccinating against AIDS is a real problem, but they can't prevent a real illness. It's not about stopping the spread of HIV/AIDS."
72,68,He's just trying to make the government realize that the virus has spread.
72,70,There are two types of people here: people with the AIDS and the non-vaccinated people with the HIV/AIDS.
73,72,"""We are all a group. We're a group. We're a group. We can't change."""

76,72,This is all on the news. It's about the president being a scammer.
77,72,"It's really not a scam, its a scam. It is a scam."
82,72,"It's been a while since I've seen that. It's just a pathetic attempt at being racist. I don't care if the CDC is trying to do something good, but it's an awful idea."
84,72,"This is not a joke, it is a joke."
90,72,"I would never have thought that this is a joke, but it's not."
72,2,Vaccinating is the only way to prevent the spread of the virus. If someone had to choose between a CDC or the CDC. If someone had to choose between a CDC or the CDC. If someone had to choose between a CDC or the CDC. If someone had to choose between a CDC or the CDC.
72,6,"""I'm going to start with the neoliberal joke, but the neoliberal one."""
72,8,The CDC is trying to annoy people to do something to prevent the spread of the virus. The jokes they have around and do not do is really a dick joke.
72,9,It's a joke. It's a joke because it's not about the virus. The CDC is doing this for everyone. It's a joke.
72,11,"""I just don't think people are saying that this is funny or not."""
72,15,"A lot of people have a mentality about vaccination and it sucks because it's not very common. I get what you're saying, but I don't think that's going to change anything. It's just a scam."
72,19,"In this case, the CDC should be focusing on the most affecting issue at hand."
72,21,">He said that if he has a t shirt on, he must wear it, in order to get it."
72,24,What if the government decides the CDC has to enforce a ban on the use of a mask?
72,25,"The guy is trying to avoid the idea that ""putting on a mask to stop the spread of a virus.he's racist.

72,26,I'm not sure I see a single joke where the CDC are really going to go all over the country to fight AIDS. But maybe it's worth it.
72,33,That CDC is trying to prevent the spread of the virus is a real problem.
72,34,I'm so sorry about this guy. I have to agree.

72,57,It seems like the joke is just being a silly joke that I've never heard.
72,68,"So basically, if you want to go get vaccines, you have to go to an OTC or Health Department for example. There's no need for an eye mask, because a bare skin one is a safest solution."
72,70,They're just going to be the ones that are doing it for us. This is a joke. This is a joke.
73,72,They have been very patient about getting vaccinated. The ACA has prompted a lot of complaints.
74,72,"You have a mask, not a masked mask. And I'm not gonna have to tell you that unless you are sure you are."
76,72,Vaccination is one of the best ways to stop the spread of a virus.
77,72,I have to give you a little extra credit for reading this:
82,72,"The president is being racist. Ingraham is not a racist. A racist is racist because of the ""right to keep locked in the house"" clause."
84,72,"I've seen the guy put up with it several times. He's just trying to make people want to do it without wearing a mask. He's fucking a dick. He's just fucking a dick. You just don't see how he can say ""here is a dick and you're doing it in a stupid way."""
90,72,The joke is that the CIA is using a mask to protect civilians from spreading a virus. It's a joke.
72,2,I think the joke is that the CDC is using a mask to prevent spread of the virus. But they should not do that.
72,6,The CIA is using a mask to protect civilians from spreading a virus. It's a joke.
72,8,The CDC is trying to annoy people to do something to prevent the spread of the virus. It's a joke because it's a joke.
72,9,He's not the only racist.
72,11,That's not exactly the best way to stop a virus from spreading. There is nothing wrong with a mask.
72,15,"I mean, this isn't about the US, but it is a great example of a joke. The American public is very apathetic about the government."
72,19,"A lot of things are not the same. A lot of things are not in the US, but in many places. This is a serious problem in the political arena. It's a real issue."
72,21,Nope. Just a bunch of the other shit.
72,24,"That doesn't matter, I'm not sure you want to hear it. You're not in a place where it's legal to do whatever you want. Having a restraining order is illegal. Vaccination is the only way to stop the spread of a virus. It's a joke."
72,25,I'm a doctor and have never heard this one.
72,26,>It's a joke because it's a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke.
72,33,Isn't a lot of people saying 'I'm just a dick' when they say they're racist?'
72,34,Is 'Muzzle'or 'Lasha' the real answer to your question?
72,35,If it's a joke then it's not a joke because it's a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke.
72,38,"Yes, he is racist. And the fact that he is a racist. There is no such thing as racist and you don't have to spit on him."
72,41,I see a lot of people in this thread who are saying that the CDC is doing the wrong thing. This is not a joke. It's a joke.
72,54,'Vaccination is the only way to stop the spread of a virus.'
72,57,It’s a joke that’s very much a joke.
72,68,It's not a joke.
72,70,A joke is a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke.
73,72,"The only thing they want is the ACA removed, because they don't want to get rid of them. And even if it's legal, it's not going to stop them from doing that. Vaccination is the best way to stop the spread of the virus. Please wear masks."
74,72,It's a prank.
76,72,Vaccination is one of the best ways to stop the spread of the virus. Vaccination is the only way to stop the spread of the virus.
77,72,I don't have a comma for that. What else did I read?
82,72,"The president is being racist. Ingraham is not a racist. A racist is racist because of the ""right to keep locked in the house"" clause. The mask, however, is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
84,72,"No, this is not a joke."
90,72,"Basically you're using a joke that you said about this, so it's like a troll."
72,2,I don't even have a comma for that.
72,6,I would never wear my mask without my permission.
72,8,>Isn't a lot of people saying 'I'm just a dick' when they say they're racist.'
72,9,"I just wanted to put it in context. My point is that people should not be afraid to get in in public. If they get vaccinated, I don't see why it would be a joke to not have a mask."
72,11,There is a lot of evidence that a troll is trying to stomp the swamp and get people to pay for his medical care. He's a troll because he's being racist.
72,15,The fact that it's a joke is not surprising.
72,19,It's really not like this is the topic of discussion on the front page. It seems like the top commenters have mixed up everything from what I read to what you say in the first comment.
72,21,"The only time I'm being honest here is when people say 'Nah, we raped and shit' and it's so difficult to hear that you're being racist' and just can't really hear anything else."
72,24,"And the CDC has the authority to enforce them, because they firmly believe they can."
72,25,Are you kidding? The only thing they want is to remove the ACA and I don't care about him...
72,26,He says he's being racist.
72,33,"In this situation, the only thing I can think of is that if you say this with a comma, that’s a joke."
72,34,Muzzle'or 'Lasha' is actually an American phrase derived from the 'no nonsense'> slang term for a group of people that try to sabotage people with HIV/AIDS. The CDC is trying to sell a mask to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS. That's a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke.
72,35,"They say if it was the CDC, then it is not legal."
72,38,Because this is a joke.
72,41,"I don't know what to do when people are like ""I don't have a choice in which country I want to go to. You know my right to die and infect others. Why isn't Ms. Ingraham out there with them."""
72,54,"I'm not sure who was the troll and what happened in that video. You should go watch it and find out, but it's pretty cool that this guy is just one of those people."
72,57,"A good answer is not to joke. But to be serious, it is."
72,68,[The CDC is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

73,72,Vaccination is the best way to stop the spread of the Zika virus. Please wear masks.
74,72,There are a bunch of stupid people who can't find anything funny by using a prank and calling it a joke.
76,72,"I'm not saying it is a scam, but I'm saying the article is about a scam troll and is pretty much inconclusive. Isn't the whole article about the guy who is trying to revoke the restraining order a scam?"
77,72,"Its very strange that people are able to tell if it's a scam, but that there's no right way to get it to work."
82,72,I'm a lawyer. I work for the CDC and I do not like to be sarcastic in a joke.
84,72,>My wife and I have been together for 3 years. She was unvaccinated and it was my fault for not having vaccinated. We were the only children.
90,72,Its a joke. The CIA is a joke. Its a joke. The CIA is using a mask to protect civilians from spreading a virus.
72,2,"Vaccination is not a joke, but they're attempting to make people who aren't infected safe to die or not die immune to the virus."
72,6,"I don't think he is the happiest politician ever, as I don't think he was a racist."
72,8,"So, what's the point of wearing a mask? Does she have to know what to do to protect herself?"
72,9,"I work for the CDC. So this may be a joke, but I can see a whole lot of it being an actual joke. I mainly work for the CIA."
72,11,"There's nothing wrong with a mask, it's just a way to be safe and secure. You don't have to be stupid to say it's a joke."
72,15,It sounds like the CDC is just snooping into his shit and not taking the lead.

72,34,Vaccination is the best way to stop the spread of the Zika virus. That's a joke. The CIA is using a mask to protect civilians from spreading a virus.
72,35,Why doesn't the CDC have a mandate to appoint someone who isn't a doctor or a doctor? Doesn't sound like the CDC is in control.

72,54,There is a lot of misinformation in the article. It sounds like a lot of people actually think it's a scam.
72,57,"I'm a lawyer, but it's a good thing I don't care who a guy is, and I'm sorry he's trying to justify it. And it's the worst kind of joke, but you're going to have to accept it."
72,68,The CDC does not have any obligation to enforce health care laws.
72,70,Is that what it is?
73,72,I'm pretty sure that's a very well known fact about vaccinating.
74,72,"It's a joke, it's a prank, the reason people have been making a prank is because people are using a prank to keep the government in check."
76,72,Are you a scientist? Because I have a restraining order on a doctor.
77,72,... the president is a shaman and he is trying to get people to stop spreading the virus.
82,72,"The president is not a racist at all. A racist is racist because of the ""right to keep locked in the house"" clause. The CDC isn't allowed to force any kind of federal mandate unless it's on TV and there isn't a mandate from the White House for it."

90,72,"...I'm not a fan of the term, doesn't mean I'm right. It seems like the only thing that people need to do is to wear a mask. It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."

72,6,Vaccination is the best way to stop the spread of the virus.
72,8,I think the CDC would be a good idea to put a warning on them when people are wearing a mask in front of a doctor. Then a little hazing would be a good idea if they weren't wearing a mask.
72,9,"A lot of people don't know about it. I think he's the kind of guy who if he is a joke can get in trouble for his actions despite it being a joke, and will have a difficult time keeping the guy from doing what he does, especially when he's a dick."

72,19,You're right. There are things that are not a joke. I am sure the people who voted for this to be racist. I am not going to have anyone else do that if my sneezed mouth didn't bleed. What does it matter if it was a joke?
72,21,"You're an idiot, troll."
72,24,There is no restraining order. But there are laws.

82,72,I'm gonna go ahead and give a short summary of the CDC's strategy for fighting the spread of a virus to people who were never vaccinated.
84,72,The CDC is not actually suing you. They are doing a great job protecting you. This is a joke. It's part of the plan and the main purpose of vaccination.
90,72,"I thought this was a joke. And you're so right, it's kind of the same."

72,33,Why the hell is the NSA trying to sell masks? It is a joke.
72,34,"In this instance, the CDC is the CDC's govt. The only govt. that is trying to sabotage the CDC's attempt to sell a mask is the US Department of Health. Vaccination is the best way to stop the spread of AIDS. It's a joke. It's a joke."
72,35,We need the people with masks to go vaccinating and stop the spread of AIDS. And the government to not wear them. Because I do not want to live my life in fear of disease if this is true.
72,38,So why can't you just be able to see the guy on a white t shirt?
72,41,"The CDC is not supposed to enforce health laws. The CDC is. They aren't. They are, in fact, a joke."
72,54,"So, you are asking me why the CDC didn't give a restraining order and a restraining order?"
72,57,"The point was that it's not actually a joke, and that's why people don't notice, and that's why they are using it as a joke."
72,68,If you don't agree with all of them and don't follow through with it...
72,70,"It is one of the worst things about American politics that I've ever heard. It is such a shame, and quite sad. I've fought for it a few times."
73,72,It’s a joke because people want to get vaccinated. I can’t see if they're trying to make it a joke.
74,72,Vaccination is a joke because it is a joke. It is a joke because a prank is a joke.
76,72,The Obama administration was a huge troll that did this without a restraining order.

72,2,"""We need the people with masks to go vaccinating and stop the spread of AIDS. Because I do not want to live my life in fear of disease if this is true."""
72,6,Because the government is trying to make a joke about what isn't the real thing. They can use masks to stop a disease. It's not a joke.

72,9,"Vaccination is an issue, and a joke. But, it's also a joke. That's a joke."

72,38,This was written by a guy who was a Democrat.
72,41,It was a joke. It was a joke. It was a joke.
72,54,You should see the CDC's website and see what's all over it.
72,57,"If it's just a joke, it's a joke. The government is going to enforce the laws for people."
72,68,"As a former CDC agent, I can assure you that if you want a safety concern you have to go to an ER (or to a doctor) or a public health care center, and you're allergic to it, you should wear a mask. You need an eye mask, but a mask that stays on your head is not appropriate."

73,72,I think the best way to stop the spread of the Zika virus is to vaccinate everybody.
74,72,The CDC uses public funds to help prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS. It is not a joke.
76,72,It is about the President in the White House trying to keep the President in power. They are trying to keep him in power.
77,72,I would argue that that's not the point of the joke.
82,72,">Weird to say that the guy is just being a pathetic attempt at being racist. The guy is just trying to make a joke. The guy is literally saying: ""[The guy is]n't quite the president he is. I think we all know the issue here."

72,6,Vaccination is the best way to stop the spread of the Zika virus. It is a joke.
72,8,"""The CDC is trying to annoy people to do something to prevent the spread of the Zika virus."""
72,9,"... Then there is the ridiculous ""I'm not a racist"" joke."
72,11,I don't see what's wrong with the fact that it's a joke - a troll or a troll?
72,15,Is it a joke?
72,19,Vaccination is a serious issue.
72,21,There's a lot of funny shit and a LOT of satire. That is the sort of crap that's hard to avoid on the Internet.
72,24,"Aside from the fact that the CDC has a very serious problem, he is not trying to be racist, and so he has no reason to be racist, which is why he is trying to make a joke."
72,25,>He was just trying to make a joke.
72,26,I think you're missing something here:
72,33,This is a lot of stuff.
72,34,I don't believe that a restraining order is a joke.
72,35,"I’m going to go in on the CDC, because we can’t be friends with a guy who will be there to get some vaccinated people."
72,38,The CDC is not racist. The CDC isn’t a threat to the public health. It’s a threat to the safety of the people. Vaccinations are a threat to the public health.
72,41,It's a joke if the person on the front page has not seen it before.
72,54,"If the guy isn't the president he's not going to get a job, you can't get a job without wearing a mask. You can't be the president who doesn't want to be the president."
72,57,It's also a joke about a guy who isn't quite the president that's making fun of the president
72,68,This is a joke. I have no idea why you're being downvoted for the first time. This isn't a joke. This isn't a joke.
72,70,CANNOTANSWER: I'm so sorry you're going through this. It is a joke. It is a joke. It is a joke.
73,72,They want to get rid of the ACA. They want to get rid of the helmet because it’s illegal to take people to hospitals. The only reason the government won’t do it is because of the ACA.
74,72,It's a joke that tells you that people aren't going to do it. They are going to try and get a citation.
76,72,And the shaming of the president is not the one that is needed for all countries.
77,72,“I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam. I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam. I lose a mask at least four times a day.

72,6,"This was a joke from the US gov't who doesn't care about the government. The gov't is a joke, but that's not really the point. This isn't an election, and the gov't hasn't done anything to stop the government from going after the virus. This is a joke."
72,8,"I'm glad the president and his supporters have the same stance on it. It's all part of what we have to do, but the president has the power to sabotage the government's plan, which is the ACA."
72,9,Vaccination is not a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.
72,11,Because he sounded like a troll?
72,15,That is all. He's trying to stop the government and the president from doing it.
72,19,"That's an inexcusable fact and it's why it's the top comment, and why it's the top comment."
72,21,"This guy's just getting into the ""rights of the people"" phase."
72,24,I've never heard anyone say anything about a doctor being a troll or being racist.
72,25,"I can't imagine having a person in an ACA office while he's on the phone and taking off his mask. There's just a lot of stuff going on, and I'd not even think about getting a mask because it would prevent me from being a doctor, huh."
72,26,Vaccinations is not a joke. It’s a joke.
72,33,There's a lot of people who want to get a job while in the military.
72,34,It's a joke because it's a joke.
72,35,Vaccination is not a joke because it's a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke.
72,38,I was reading this as someone who wasn't aware of this joke.
72,41,"I don't think it's funny to see people try to make fun of Obama after being shit the ""no joke"" stance that he was making. It's a joke."
72,54,The CDC is trying to hammer the trolls. It's not that the president is making fun of him but it's not the president that is making fun of him.
72,57,"A lot of things are so stupid, I thought they should have a story like this."
72,68,"I don't see why they don't just get a citation, they are being downvoted to the trash. Basically they say, 'They're not racist, they're not racist' - they are just trying to make fun of the President, but they're trying to use it to make money."
72,70,It's not a joke. It's a joke because it's supposed to keep the public safe. It's a joke because it's the only thing that can be saved.

76,72,That's very serious. The whole thing is a scam.
77,72,"This is the part that gets the most media attention. The CIA is essentially the US government. It has been over 30 years. The president is a shaman, and he's been sacked."
82,72,"The people who don't want to be vaccinated are not allowed to have it. The government is trying to make it legal for people who want to keep the vaccine, even if the president doesn't."
84,72,"This guy is trying to take the job of the president into account, right?"
90,72,I think the joke is that a troll is a troll if that means someone has to wear a mask to protect them from a virus if they need to carry the virus.
72,2,"Because a lot of people in my country don't know how to do it, and haven't seen the vaccine yet, and I'm pretty sure Obama's a troll."
72,6,This is the worst meme I've ever heard.
72,8,So the president and his supporters are actually trying to force the CDC to protect people. I think they’re trying to make the president look shady and silly.
72,9,"I see a few of these. If it were a joke, it might be a little more obvious. But, a few of them are legitimate jokes."
72,11,... the only way to stop the spread of the Zika virus is to wear a mask.
72,15,Is the CDC trying to make the president and the government stop?
72,19,The CDC is not authorized to enforce the protections for people who want to be vaccinated. It's just a joke. It's a joke.

72,25,I've gotten to know some of the people involved in the ACA in a lot of ways. They’re racist. They don’t think he's a joke. They think he’s a shaman.
72,26,"It's a joke because it's a joke, but it's a joke because it's a joke."
72,33,"So basically, if you are an adult and a doctor you are the right guy to be a doctor but not a president, and this isn't something that you should be afraid to do, you should try to avoid going into the bathroom with you (or anything else in the kitchen)."
72,34,I don't think it's a joke to be in the military.
72,35,"I think the president is playing a very smart game with how to make a joke about it. If you're really into politics, you're probably already familiar with the ""responsible for acting like a troll, who's just shaming the president."""
72,38,You are the CDC. It doesn’t work and a CDC does not want the public fuck to have access to vaccines and the CDC doesn’t want the government to treat citizens like children.
72,41,"I know you're getting a lot of different kinds of responses from the other comments but the ones you made are very atypical, in a negative way. I think your post has a lot of similar stories but a lot of different things going on."
72,54,You can be a doctor. You can't be a doctor. You have to be a doctor. You can't be a doctor. You can't be a doctor. You can't be a doctor. You can't be a doctor. You have to be a doctor. You can't be a doctor. You have to be a doctor. You cannot be a doctor. You cannot be a doctor. You can't be a doctor. You can't be a doctor.
72,57,"It's a joke, because it's going to make the CDC look like a joke."

82,72,"Vaccines are a shit show. What's a shit show? Vaccines, on the other hand, are dangerous because of their illegal use."
84,72,"I think that the title has nothing to do with the CDC, it just has to do with the general trend of all of the national health organizations going against it.

90,72,"The first one is an interesting piece about the situation in your post. In addition to the first a couple of questions about how many 'trolls' are on Reddit, I'm not sure what you're saying here is inherently offensive, because it essentially implies that a person has a problem with the government because they don't have an answer. You're thinking of the other guys in your post as a troll that can't answer a question, or a joke that isn't a joke?"
72,2,I'm not sure that you're trolls at all.
72,6,I would never wear a mask without my permission. I have a comma. Those are the basic facts. It's a joke. But that's not the end of the world.

72,34,"I have to be honest - he's right to joke about AIDS, but he's also a shaman and this is a good example of what he's talking about. I don't really know if the guy's just a shaman, but in that case, I'd be very angry about him."

It's a lot like the other story but it has some flaws, one of which is that you've read an article about the president who is in the White House trying to get the government to put the word ""vaccine"" in quotes. So it doesn't have the same meaning as the story, but essentially it's just a joke that is a joke."
72,57,"I don't have much a lot of knowledge on how the CDC is doing it, but I can tell you there's a fair amount of context where this is being presented."
72,68,The CDC is trying to get the CDC to be able to use the mask to stop the spread of the virus.

72,9,"That’s not funny at all. The fact that the jokes are being made based on the CDC's actions is just a bit atypical, and I think people need to realize that they are making a joke about what’s really being done in America. I’ve seen people say the CDC is invading the world and it’s the best thing to do, despite the fact that it may be a joke."

77,72,That's pretty crazy. The word'scam' means to have a legitimate purpose.
82,72,"""Waying a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
84,72,Vaccination is important. It is an important part of the health system. It is important because it is an important part of the health system.

72,15,"They're trying to get the government to stop using the word troll and get the government to stop using it as a joke, instead of being a joke."
72,19,I see how this might have got picked up in the comment. Mostly as an issue with the CDC not having the authority to enforce the hivemind but as an issue with the CDC being a joke that I don't see any reason to disagree with that - and what do I do that I can't get past with that?
72,21,"I don't think we have a lot of people that don't wear masks in the US, but they've got a pretty large number of people in it. They're not saying that you can't have a mask, but that it's good and not a joke."

72,57,The story is going on a bit in an article by the CDC.

72,34,I have the same opinion on the CDC as your post. It's a joke. Vaccines are a joke. They're a joke because they prevent the spread of AIDS. They're a joke. I don't know how much of the CDC a shaman is. I don't think it's a joke.
72,35,"''I’m not sure what to say, because I’ve been through some of these a couple of times now."
72,38,Vaccines are not allowed under federal regulations. It's a joke because it's illegal.
72,41,"I am gonna say I can not say that I'm funny. I just think that when someone tries to say something about the CDC, they get pretty confused and make a mess. It seems like someone just wants to get his act together. The guy has the power to tell it, it just doesn't make sense."
72,54,The fact that people aren't taking a joke is pretty common enough that the CDC is the right one to take the joke.
72,57,"The CDC doesn't have to enforce any laws on vaccination, it's just a joke."
72,68,"The CDC wants to make fun of the President, and that’s why he made a joke. The CDC didn’t want people who were sick to be infected with the virus to get a vaccinated. It's an important part of the health system."
72,70,It's a joke because they are trying to protect the public from the spread of AIDS. It's not a joke.
73,72,"I think the ACA is a joke. The president should make an announcement about how ""we're going to stop the spread of Zika. Please wear masks."""
74,72,It's a joke. It's a joke.
76,72,> I'm going out on a limb and say this. The first paragraph is a little harsh. I think this is a very good article. I'm going out on a limb and say this.
77,72,[The CIA is essentially the US government.](http://www.reddit.com/r/obama_news/events/events_dates/news_2016_07/)
82,72,"Why does it matter? Because if he's trying to make a joke about it, he's essentially trying to get the government to take credit for that. It's not like there's a political issue, it's just a joke, it's a joke."
84,72,"If it wasn't a joke, I wouldn't have had a problem with it."
90,72,“I think you’re right” is an awesome riff on a joke.
72,2,">The CDC is trying to make fun of the president, and that's why he made a joke. ''They are just for a joke because it's a joke."
72,6,Yes. And it's a joke. It's a joke.
72,8,"Vaccines are illegal, but their purpose is to prevent the spread of AIDS."

72,15,It isn't a joke because he wants to get people to vaccinate him. It isn't a joke because the people who are trying to put people at risk aren't going to see what he wants. It isn't a joke because he wants to make the government do the job.
72,19,The CDC is a joke. They're not going to force people to take their masks and prevent the spread of disease. They're going to force people to take the medication they're ineffective at.
72,21,"If I were Trump, I'd wear a mask because that is what I would say, not because of my family."
72,24,>I don't know how much of the CDC is essentially the US government.
72,25,Vaccines are not a joke because it is illegal. They are not allowed under federal regulations.
72,26,Why aren't we talking about the CDC and not the CDC?
72,33,"Vaccines are legal, but is not illegal."
72,34,This isn't really about Obama at all. This is about the CDC. It's about what's possible that they're trying to make them illegal. It's basically how it's designed to spread the virus.

72,38,No one has asked for a CDC policy or a CIA policy on the subject.
72,41,I'm going to say a word.
72,54,What's the difference? Vaccination is the only way to prevent the spread of AIDS.
72,57,"I would like to give my 2 cents to the CDC, they can have a ""scam"" if they want. That would be really weird."
72,68,There's an awful lot that the CIA is trying to say to people about a joke on an issue that has been a major issue in our government for almost five decades.
72,70,I’m a joke.
73,72,I think the ACA is a joke. Vaccination is an issue because it helps people recognize their symptoms.
74,72,It's a joke. It is a joke. It's a joke.
76,72,You can't make a restraining order because it doesn't matter.
77,72,I think it would be nice to see the CDC show it as a movie instead of just a shaman.
82,72,The president is trying to make a joke about it. That's a joke.
84,72,"This is about vaccines, not about the joke."
90,72,CANNOTANSWER FROM THE CIA.
72,2,"Because that's not how it works. They're in an essentially non-functional position, and it's a joke. This isn't about what you're talking about. This is about what is on the CDC's agenda, and you're a joke. It's not about what the CDC is trying to make fun of."
72,6,I'm going to start with the neoliberal joke.
72,8,You're not a joke. It's just a joke.
72,9,"Vaccination is not a joke, because it is a joke. It is a joke because it isn't funny at all."
72,11,It seems like a joke. What makes you think the president is a troll?
72,15,The CDC is going to become the best option for preventing a repercussion of the virus in the US and thus the CDC has a much more important role in keeping us safe.
72,19,They are just trying to get people to come out and make fun of the president.
72,21,"The CDC is trying to push some of the worst, worst policies of the world, not to make it sound like a joke."
72,24,Because this is not a joke. It's an attempt to make a joke about the president. 'Cause they're trying to make a joke about the president.
72,25,Then this guy is racist. His comment is actually racist. It is a joke because he is racist. His point is that this guy is a joke because they are trying to sabotage people.
72,26,Yes. It's a joke. But it's a joke because it's a joke.
72,33,Vaccines are illegal. The CDC isn't. They're not illegal. This isn't a joke. This is a joke.
72,34,"It's a joke, a joke because it's a joke. The president wants the government to stop it."
72,35,This is a joke. The CDC is not allowed to enforce a mandate. It's not a joke because it's a joke.
72,38,Vaccines are not allowed under federal regulations. Because they don’t share the same interests as the CDC. They are not allowed under federal regulations.
72,41,"If you’re going to go with this guy, be honest. You’ve got the wrong idea. You’re also a racist."
72,54,It is a joke. You know what? It sounds a bit like a joke. I read the title and didn't see a word in it.
72,57,"You're the first person to read the article? Then, they're going to be asking if they are really allowed to put masks on people. Especially if they're going to be taking the whole joke seriously."
72,68,It's a joke because the CIA doesn't enforce health care laws and the CDC can't enforce any health care laws.
72,70,"I don't think it's a joke, and I don't think it's going to go away. I think we are in for a real shock and disappointment."
73,72,I'm sure the other joke isn't a joke if it's the only one. The other joke is because it's illegal. The ACA is not. The only reason it's illegal. It's illegal because it's illegal.
74,72,"They do not give the vaccines out. But it's not a joke, it's a joke. It's a joke. The government should stop."
76,72,"He can go into the public eye and make his point to everyone he meets, who they can't help themselves to, that he knows he can't even help, or that he has a chance to fuck himself."
77,72,"I don't think he's actually being a shaman, but I think the CIA should be more upfront. The CDC can be used to monitor people with a mask that they believe in and it shouldn't even be used for that. The CIA can't use a shaman, it's just not a valid reason."
82,72,I’d have to say:
84,72,Vaccination is a big part of the health system. 'Vaccination is important in both ways. It is important because it is an important part of the health system. It is an important part of the health system.
90,72,It's not an anti-virus joke. It's an anti-adverses virus joke. I don't think there's much I can do about it.
