101,43,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
43,2,I was told by a friend that the only way to stop a disease is to keep a doctor out of your lungs. Apparently you've never smoked.
43,6,I'm afraid of you.... or the people on the left who say they think this is an option.
43,13,...because you fucking have no choice but to wear a mask? What the fuck?!
43,14,"I am getting all raged about a man wearing a mask, and I am not really interested in this. I am not the only one."
43,19,This is very interesting. Is there a good way to get you vaccinated? It is really a good way for the guys to prevent people from getting sick by wearing masks.
43,20,i ain't gonna fuck off. i just won a hockey match.
43,21,"''A sham'' and ''Obama'' are two pretty big things. They are the government, not the players. I'm very surprised that it's ok not to wear a mask. But if they are, the truth is that it's a scam."

43,28,"Wearing a mask,any mask and you will see the leakage. It's frightening how dumb they think all of is are."
43,29,The best way to stop the spread of a virus is with a mask.
43,30,"That's right. The mask is just an erotic plastic piece that is worn by the players. When they have to cut it out or replace it, they can simply put on a mask and take it off."
43,37,The government is taking steps to help stop the spread of a virus.
43,39,The NSA is basically threatening and infecting people with the virus. So they're telling the media to not wear it.
43,40,I'm sure that you have all the answers on this subject.

101,43,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
43,2,It is a scam to be afraid to go to the NSA to get you vaccinated.
43,6,You are not a guy. It is not a scam. I'm a man.

43,19,I’m just gonna go to your wiki page and say this:
43,20,"Vaccination is a way to prevent the spread of a virus by using masks and a mask. In the USA it is a federal law, which allows a person to legally wear a mask without a helmet if they have a case for it."

43,22,"I'm gonna leave you alone, but hey, I'll get you on."
43,28,"I haven't heard anything about wearing a mask, but I'm going to say this."
43,29,And the best way to stop the spread of a virus is with a mask.
43,30,"It's pretty good advice to ask the players for help. The biggest threat is when a player gets fucked. They can't even tell the truth, so it's up to them to find an alternative."
43,37,It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
43,39,It's the anti-virus movement. The vaccines will stop the spread of a virus.
43,40,The best way to stop the spread of a virus is with a mask. That's right. The mask is just an erotic plastic piece that is worn by the players.
45,43,"I am a lawyer. I was vaccinated and I lost a mask because I was so sick. And since the government has no mandates to wear a mask or wear a helmet I'm sure they'll be out the door and if I don't wear it I wouldn't have been able to make the first attempt. But the vaccine is already banned, and it could cause more injuries and a bigger problem."

I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam. I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam.
71,43,It's frightening how dumb they think all of is.
79,43,"Unless you were under the impression that it was in the constitution, then a mask is just the smallest thing we can do to protect our human rights."
91,43,A scam! Apparently it means it doesn't work.
101,43,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
43,2,"This seems to be a general consensus on the subject, but apparently, that is just one of a variety of things. I think if I wore a mask I would have gotten caught, but I wouldn't be able to risk the health of the players if I didn't. If my masks don't work I would probably be able to get them back."
43,6,Apparently this means the government is using a virus and not the players.
43,13,I'm in a doctor's office. It's just part of the anti-virus movement. The vaccinations are a problem.
43,14,We all have this question: Who did you shit on? What are you guys??
43,19,"The biggest threat is when a player gets fucked. They can't even tell the truth, so it's up to them to find an alternative."
43,20,I just bought my first helmet and have seen it in action at a game. That mask is just a plastic piece that is worn by the players. I love hockey but if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops.
43,21,"I was vaccinated for the first time in a couple of years. So I lost it, and I got the virus, but I have no proof. I had a couple months'experience wearing a mask, and it did get me through the CDC and my school."
43,22,"I'm the one that has some evidence to support this nonsense. Then again, there isn't any proof that it was in the constitution."
43,28,"We have a vaccine in every sports league you can think of, I'd say it has the potential to do a lot more harm than good."
43,29,He could be a bad joke. And it's not a fraud. He's the one a fraud could have. But he has the right to be called a fraud.
43,30,The NSA is basically threatening and infecting people with the virus. And they don't even have the right to resign.
43,37,You don't get an anti-virus vaccine.
43,39,"I think he was thinking it was more that he was not allowed to wear a mask. I mean, he could have gotten a better vaccine without a helmet, and if he wasn't then he would have had to be on the sidelines."
43,40,Vaccination is a way to prevent the spread of a virus.
45,43,The CDC is not a nfl official so a lot of people can't really blame him for trying to get the vaccine.
59,43,"I'm going to be really blunt and say, ""This is one of those people who seems like they've got too much power to be involved in anything."""

71,43,Then you wear the mask.
79,43,"What the president's response to the issue is, 'If the government doesn't want to protect its citizens, if it doesn't want to protect the lives of other people's children, and then doesn't want to protect their children, then you're wrong.'"
91,43,"I've read a lot of stories with this exact quote, but it seems like it was written with a language..."
101,43,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
43,2,Vaccination is a way to stop the spread of a virus.
43,6,You're assuming that these players aren't wearing the mask?
43,13,I'd be extremely pissed.
43,14,"This is the sort of thing the NSA has no incentive to protect, I guess."
43,19,"I don't see how anyone would be against this guy. But I am going to be blunt and say, ""This is one of those people who seems like they've got too much power to be involved in anything."""
43,20,The CDC is not a nfl official. CDC is not a nfl official.
43,21,"He was vaccinated. You can't go n' go sexy on his helmet, though."
43,22,I’m not a lawyer. I know I’m wrong. I’m just an uninformed individual that I’ve never heard of any such thing. If I had known my father who was a lawyer I would have told him to leave the state. If it were me I’d go to the doctor and get a free one. If I went to a doctor and he didn’t want to do that it’s probably too easy. I’d be a good judge.
43,28,"It has the potential to do a lot more harm than good. It could be a scam, but it is a scam."

I'm the one that has some evidence to support this nonsense."
43,30,A lot of the NSA is making them look like frauds to me.
43,37,The president has nothing to do with the anti-virus movement. His actions are what led to his presidency.
43,39,I think the issue has more to do with how he was going to give the vaccine and that he could have got a better vaccine.
43,40,"This is a fucked up question. People in the nfl have a history of defending the government. It is illegal. We can't pretend that it is actually the government, but that's not fair."
45,43,What does the CDC do? Aren't they just taking a look at the players wearing the mask if they want to stay in the team?
59,43,"I'm not trying to be rude, but I have a hard time understanding why people wouldn't wear a mask if they have the power to stop a virus spread. I just want to hear what the government is doing now, as a way of working around the problem."
70,43,"Well there's only one exception, the fact that people wear masks is the most likely explanation of the problem."
71,43,"> I've never worn a mask, but now i'm wearing one :)"", ""You're a scam. You're a scam."""
79,43,Because people are stupid for pointing out that people have a right to wear masks and that they have a right to wear them. And the fact that he has an idea is the most insulting thing I've ever heard.
91,43,The people that believe this quote are the government and their medical providers.
101,43,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
43,2,I don't think this is actually a question that can be answered.
43,6,They're only giving the masks to players that are actually vaccinated to stop the spread of the virus.
43,13,Basically speaking the NSA has no legal obligation to protect players if the government decides to harmed their cause. I’m not sure the issue stands today but it will continue to accustom players and officials to their own medical advice.
43,14,"So there are some ways to stop the spread of a virus if the CDC has some sort of surveillance mechanism that can prevent the CDC from spreading. I see it is more in the context of the CDC and the NFL, but I can imagine the government is being abused as well."
43,19,"Honestly, I don't think you're the only one who's sounded like a bad person. But you're a person who doesn't have any sort of understanding of a person. I've never seen it, but I'd be scared if I did. I would just shit on that guy."
43,20,'We're not talking about a CDC. We're talking about a federal law. We're talking about a federal law allowing us to wear a mask without a helmet. We do not have any rules in our area about wearing a mask without a helmet. We also have laws preventing people from wearing it with masks that we aren't allowed to wear on our own. It's all part of our collective responsibility to protect ourselves.
43,21,"The biggest problem is when a player gets fucked. They can't even tell the truth, so it's probably too easy. I’m just an uninformed individual that I’ve never heard of any such thing.

If I had known his father who was a lawyer I’d tell him to leave the state. If a politician is an immigrant then he"
43,22,It's the CDC who does that.
43,28,"The issue is not just the CDC, but it is the virus and its causes."
43,29,It sounds like the NSA is using a virus as an excuse for not allowing the players to get their vaccines. They are not authorized to have them in a facility because they don't have the same safety procedures and are only allowed to have the masks.
43,30,I've never shit on anyone. i'm sorry this happened to me.
43,37,It's not a fucked up question. Is there a reason why you wear a mask?
43,39,That's pretty cool. I was a lawyer for a few years before we were able to get a free helmet and it was really a shit job to get vaccinated.
43,40,The most frightening thing I've ever heard.
45,43,"If the CDC has no mandates to wear a mask, then there's no reason to stop it from being rolled over to the head coach."

70,43,i know that i was a big fan of the govt. before i went through and read his statements... what is the point of using that as a gimmick?
71,43,"What? No, it's just a mask, it's supposed to mask the way I can't sleep without it, I'm afraid. I'm afraid my breathing isn't affected when I smoke."
79,43,">Wording a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.He probably just needs to get his shit together with a group of friends that are actually involved in the politics of the health care slam and a mask, or they'll go over their heads and complain about it."
91,43,I'm not sure about the other r/viral
101,43,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
43,2,Vaccination is the most important thing you need to take seriously in your health care. It takes a long time for the people that are going to be sick or injured to know what the problem is. It's hard to do.
43,6,"A mask and the vaccines have to be worn on the players so that the players cannot get sick. You don't know if you need the mask to stop the spread of the virus. They are allowed to wear the masks to a medical facility, you'll just be wearing the ones that they have."
43,13,I can't tell you what the big deal is with the NSA. They don't have to protect players and officials.
43,14,"Considering the CDC and the NFL aren't actually promoting the vaccines, they don't seem like the one that is. They have been used as a proxy for the government if that is the case. I think people like to call it the ""virus"" thing. They don't want to be a proxy for the CDC because they have no authority to make laws that aren't able to provide vaccines for a few years."
43,19,It's not a good idea. I'm just an uninformed individual.
43,20,That is the biggest thing I ever heard.
43,21,The question is if this is a legitimate reason to have no one come to pick you up and leave. Besides you might be the only one that is aware of the health issue with vaccines. I'd leave a big one.
43,22,[Is there a reason why you wear a mask? That's pretty cool. I was a lawyer for a few years before we were able to get a free helmet. We also have laws preventing people from wearing it with masks that we aren't allowed to wear on our own. It's all part of our collective responsibility to protect ourselves.
43,28,"This is how I grew up. I'm allergic to many of the stuff that goes on in the US. So if I could afford to take a vaccination, I'd do it."
43,29,"It's a pity that the masks were provided for the players not to get vaccinated, or even because the players were so well screened and not screened, so that the players could be vaccinated. That's so ridiculous."
43,30,"Well, that's not so much the problem that you're addressing here. You're referring to the fact that the CDC is actively invading health care and trying to prevent it. That's not the same as the fact that there are some people who are even able to get a free helmet, but they are more than willing to risk the damage from being exposed to the virus. It's pretty ridiculous."
43,37,"Yes, I agree that a mask is required by law to protect the body, not to take the players with them."
43,39,I'm a lawyer too. My job is to give vaccines to my parents when I get my daughter pregnant.
43,40,He should get his masks from the CDC.
45,43,>I would be happy if my team had a full year and then I'd have a restraining order against them. What does the CDC do? Aren't they just taking a look at the players wearing a mask if they want to stay in the team?
59,43,The syphilis vaccine is a good way to stop the spread of the disease.
70,43,Is that what you are trying to say?
71,43,"I do not believe in any fake stuff, just the way some people describe it."
79,43,"If it's a joke, the NSA will just scream and the NSA will be right. It's also being blatantly racist."
91,43,>The people that believe this quote are the government and their medical providers.
101,43,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
43,2,Isn't that exactly the issue the CDC is trying to fix?
43,6,Are they allowed to wear the masks in public? Because I'm the only one that is aware of the problem.
43,13,"...I grew up with the CDC and the NFL. My father is a teacher. My mom and a friend are all college students, and the kids get their own vaccines. My father is a doctor and their children are not too many years older than me. I'm a little bit ashamed that they don't want my dad to be able to bring me to work."
43,14,"You're making the case that the NSA is using the word ""virus"" on the name, and not ""virus"" on the name."
43,19,"What are the big risks? Vaccination? I've heard that the biggest danger is when a player gets fucked and they can't even tell the truth, so it's up to them to find an alternative."
43,20,"The CDC has a lot of stuff blatantly racist, which is why they're called the ""virus"" thing."
43,21,I agree that you should have a safety and sexy mask and not something that you are able to do. You can do anything for a living in the world where it's not legal.
43,22,"I'm sorry to hear that, but I can't seem to find any source of the truth here."
43,28,What would happen if I did get a free helmet? I'm not sure if that's an option if I do have a restraining order.

43,39,I'm not sure you really believe this is a joke.

45,43,">The idea of wearing a mask because the person you aren't being a fraudster is a scam, and it isn't a legitimate reason to use it. I would say it's a scam, and this isn't about the mask."
59,43,You're a nut. You're a stupid.
70,43,I have a couple of friends who live here. One of them wears a mask. She's so sick with a cold that she doesn't even know she can take them out.
71,43,This is a scam. And what is not a scam?
79,43,"As a conservative myself, it seems the president is trying to convince me that afaik is a good idea but he's doing the same thing as the NSA. So, I'll stick to your blatant afaik word."
91,43,I like the humor but i'm not sure how it compares to what i read in the sub and how it makes sense.
101,43,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
43,2,"I don't think that's an issue in the slightest. Vaccination, as you said, is not illegal."

43,39,"So what does it mean to be a lawyer and a lawyer? I'm sorry to hear it, but I'm not sure what you think. This is a joke. I don't see a difference between the fact that he wears a mask and the fact that he is being a scam. I don't know how he will ever be able to use one.

71,43,I wore a mask on the day I was diagnosed with HIV and I'm not sure why I think I smoked cigarette.
79,43,I don't think he knows what's going on here.
91,43,Vaccination is an essential part of protecting against any virus. It's not a joke. It's a joke. It's just saying that the people who are vaccinated aren't the ones that can stop the spread of a virus.
101,43,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
43,2,What about the people that wear masks to stop the spread of a virus?
43,6,I'd consider this a joke.
43,13,"I don't know why you're being so harsh, you are being cynical, you are being a joke, you are being a joke, and you're being a joke."
43,14,It isn’t a joke because it is a joke that the CDC is not supporting. It’s a joke because it is a joke and he doesn’t support it. Vaccination is an essential part of protecting against any virus.
43,19,"In most cases, it's actually the best idea to remove the mask. The best way to stop the spread of a virus is to stop the spread of a virus."
43,20,I'd just make it a joke.
43,21,"No, you're not saying this is a joke. Your argument is an appropriation of this one based on facts from other sources, and not facts from the one you're using."

43,29,Vaccination is a joke.

43,39,Why do you think the president would not have had a shot to get the vaccine if he lied to them about the ACA?
43,40,"I think the point of Vaccination is to stop the spread of the virus, rather than to stop the spread of the virus, that is what the president's goal is. And a good way to stop the spread of the virus."
45,43,It's a joke about people being racist and being able to blame Obama and the NSA for all of it.

43,13,They are trying to show that the president is not a racist and that the government is being a prick.
43,14,If the president is 'prick' then he should not have had a shot and can't get the vaccine unless he wants to have it in his office.
43,19,The most offensive thing they say is 'I'm a dick because I don't understand why the president would not have had a shot to get the vaccine if he lied to them about the ACA''.
43,20,"That's a lot of racist words that are used frequently by people in these situations, and they're often used in ways that are far more relevant to them."
43,21,There's a lot of evidence that the CDC is trying to stop the spread of a virus. They're using the same phrase for a proxy.
43,22,Why do we think the CDC is being racist? The president is being racist because he lied about the ACA and they would have been lying about it. The CDC is trying to prove the ACA is racist.

43,40,That CDC is going to take a joke and make it a joke.
45,43,I don’t know if you are offended but you’re not racist at all.
59,43,"Because they are not responsible for preventing people from getting sick, and are not a reason to not want to get vaccinated. This is the best joke in the history of a country."
70,43,"I’m a huge fan of the Republican Party. I just didn’t want to make a crappy joke about the Obama Administration, because I can’t get people to understand the meaning of that. I just didn’t want to be the one claiming the party wasn’t very racist and that the president could have been an asshole for being racist and not have gotten a bad impression. I want to give the president an opportunity to make a joke about the people who aren’t assholes, and they will be in the white house after the presidential candidate."

43,22,"The CDC has been threatening to slap the embargo, because they are the ones who are going to take over the White House. I think this is the perfect example of a joke. The President is trying to do something that would benefit those who are not so lucky in his own eyes."

43,40,Why do you think that the CDC is trying to stop a viral infection?
