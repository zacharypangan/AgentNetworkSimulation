72,68,"Trump said it's ok not to wear mask, and Ingraham said it's restricting our rights to keep us locked inside! You know our right to die and infect (kill) others. Why isn't Ms. Ingraham out there with them."
90,68,putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i ve ever done in my entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things
68,6,"The whole ""witch con is a mess"" thing is just stupid and stupid. It would be weird if there were any more laws in the U.S. about it, like ""as a vaccinated person with boosters i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask i will not go"
68,9,> We can’t have the mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask
68,17,You have no idea what that means.
68,21,TwitchCon doesn't have a mandate.
68,23,[This](http://www.mcgadvisor.com/news/2015/03/02/Twitch-con/) is an event that requires you to wear a mask.
68,26,Yeah i'm sure a lot of people can relate to TWitchcon.
68,29,I mean the guy who went to Twitchcon and went to the event with a vaccinated person with boosters. We had to put on a mask and the person who was vaccinated was also put on a mask.
68,37,Vaccinated person with boosters i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask
68,40,"Having to go to an event like that is like having to leave school. And, with that being said, I would be very uncomfortable for a second in any event that would require a mask."
68,42,"In the context of the thread, I ain't gonna take it. I just need to learn how to do this."
68,59,"I went to a game once that is what i got, and after a good 2 hours of talking about what happened, my wife had an episode with a friend that had been on the air in a room with no air conditioning... The scene was like ""what did the other guys say about the first song?"""
68,61,I don't understand your point
68,66,I agree with you a lot i guess
72,68,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.Trump said it's ok not to wear mask, and Ingraham said it's restricting our rights to keep us locked inside! You know our right to die and infect (kill) others. Why isn't Ms. Ingraham out there with them."
90,68,So basically all you do is put on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then take it off when you get to your table is one of the dumbest things you have done in your entire life and i have done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things you have done in your entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask to walk ten feet through

68,9,I'm a non-masked vaccinated person. This isn't how I do things.
68,17,The new ACA that covers the whole issue of a vaccinated person without a mask.
68,21,"We can't have the mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask. And the whole ""witchcon is a mess"" thing is just stupid and stupid. It would be weird if there were any more laws in the U.S. about it, like ""as a vaccinated person with boosters i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear "
68,23,I agree with you on that.
68,26,The other thing that might make you want to avoid the fucking convention is the lack of a fucking permit to be on the air. You're gonna do it.
68,29,Vaccinated person with boosters i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask
68,37,"TWitchcon has a law that allows people to wear masks as long as the person they are vaccinated for does not have boosters. If your partner has one, they can wear it and you can just go anywhere you want, and not just get in."
68,40,"As a woman with boosters, I'm not going to say that I would be uncomfortable. But I would be uncomfortable with not wearing a mask. And, with that being said, I would be uncomfortable with wearing a mask. But I do have a mask I use for my work. So, the best way to keep me from being in my job and taking care of myself is if you are a woman - that is the best way."
68,42,"In a nutshell, the mask is actually a medical device."
68,59,"You want to go to Twitchcon? Those people are getting a real, big problem with the upcoming elections."
68,61,"I’m a doctor, I don’t know that people in the US are supposed to be vaccinated, and I don’t think that ‘doing it for me’ is the correct way of saying it. I thought the guy in the twitch con with boosters was a bad person, and not a twitch doctor. I’m not sure if he wants to go back."
68,66,"It's a really bad idea to have your doctor remove you from your body at any time during a visit to the hospital. But if you are going to attend the event, you may want to check if your doctor has an ebola virus."
72,68,"So basically, if you want to go get vaccines, you have to go. You might want to go to an OTC or Health Department for example. It's not like that a whole lot of people here have no idea what a virus is, but they're all trying to make sure that you're getting them in."
90,68,"In my city, one of the worst things to do in the city is to be a cop and say ""Hey, I am trying to help you."". This is all the reason why people need a mask in their homes. This is so crazy that I'm scared I'm going to die... Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
68,6,I just wanted to say that the new ACA is a mess.
68,9,"It's kinda like ""The mask is a medical device. We can't have the mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask. It's just not how I do things."""
68,17,That's ridiculous and I'm just trying to be reasonable. I'm going to ask the real reason why people need a mask in their homes.
68,21,"I'm a little embarrassed to say I can't see the implication of wearing a mask at TwitchCon, though."
68,23,Vaccined person with boosters.
68,26,"I'm a man with boosters. I went to a game once that is what i got, and after a good 2 hours of talking about what happened, my wife had an episode with a friend that had been on the air in a room with no air conditioning... The scene was like ""what did the other guys say about the first song?"""
68,29,This isn't an election afaik. The people who are sick aren't just talking about their health. It's about being a good friend to the people who care about their health.
68,37,Vaccinated people with boosters in the U.S. must be at risk for infection and death. In the U.S. it is illegal to infect your spouse without a prescription.
68,40,"If they are going to stop being vaccinated, a man can start doing that. You can't make a woman, you can't get a man and that's it."
68,42,"I was a doctor at Twitchcon last year and he got to sit in a mask at my desk while I was working. The doctor insisted that I wear my mask when I didn't see the person (which was not true), but told me that my mask was in fact the only thing that allowed him to go to the event. I thought he was a douchebag, but that he wanted to come home and see me?"
68,59,"The ""witchcon"" is the most popular news event in the United States today."
68,61,TWitchcon and the new ACA are all about how to keep people safe from getting sick and infect others.
68,66,The Obama administration is working on making the federal government stop using masks to protect people in the country.
72,68,">Where do I sign up to be a commissioner for a hs or hs hs team? The hivemind is going to say the same thing. I have a question. Why did the ebola virus break out in my state? The only way to prevent the spread of a virus is to cut it off, and then use an eye mask, or even a bare skin one. When you ask ""Are you allowed to wear a mask because of a safety concern? """
90,68,"No, it's not that the government isn't trying to stop it, it's that they are trying to protect others from the dangers of disease, like you're saying."
68,6,That's what I read. I haven't tried to learn about the vaccines and my friends in public. I'm just an asshole.
68,9,People want to have a doctor and a hivemind? I think they don't. They want their doctors to have an interview.
68,17,The new ACA doesn't cover the whole issue of a vaccinated person without a mask.
68,21,>As a vaccinated person with boosters i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask.
68,23,>Where do I sign up to be a commissioner for a hs or hs hs team?
68,26,It was only a joke about the virus. A vaccinated person wearing a mask wouldn't get a sick person out. They would get a good laugh out of it.
68,29,"I was at the TWitchcon last year, and a doctor went to the event with a vaccineed person with boosters, and my husband was not in the bathroom, so he had to wear a mask."
68,37,I don't see why youre being a douchebag here.
68,40,The ACA is a mess.
68,42,"It's just the ACA and not the ACA, I don't want to have to go to a party unless you want me to."
68,59,"""""I went to a game once that is what i got,"
68,61,"Why isn't it allowed to be a mask? You know that the people in our country can get sick. They can't keep a person on their hands while they are wearing a mask. Until that time, when a guy doesn't have boosters, they can't wear a mask. It's really just not a good idea."
68,66,I think I understand how r/health is coming off as. There is no good answer here.
72,68,>I've found there is a special kind of mask that keeps you from touching things that might be infected. It's not worth it. It's a form of mask. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
90,68,"The article explains how this is an abomination that is very common in American culture. There is a big difference between ""a troll"" and ""a racist."" That's a bit like saying: You can't have sex without a mask."
68,6,...because you are the one who doesn't know how to be safe and why everyone else does. The one who has learned the secret to keeping away people from getting sick is a troll.
68,9,> I think I understand how r/health is coming off as. There is no good answer here. The ACA is a mess. It's just the ACA and not the ACA.
68,17,They also have to get vaccines when you get infected.
68,21,"It was a joke, but now it's a real problem."
68,23,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
68,26,I'd call him a douchebag for being so obnoxious that he could be a troll.
68,29,Vaccination is very important. We have vaccines all the time and you should be very careful.
68,37,"If I were you, I would go to the TWitchcon. I don't get it, I just want to make sure people aren't going to get sick in the future. I'm just stating my point, not that you're being douchebag. I'm just saying you're being a douchebag, I can't help but wonder if you can stand to get sick on your own without wearing a mask."
68,40,Nope. Those are the worst things people can do.
68,42,"The ACA is a mess, the ACA doesn't. And I'm just an asshole."
68,59,"If I'm reading the article properly, it says that while the anti-vaccine party is largely against the ACA, and not against the current ACA, that does not mean that it is against the new ACA. The ACA is not supporting the government."
68,61,"It's not an abomination, just a way to keep the federal government from using masks, because they're not allowed to use them. I'd wear a mask in a school or college."
68,66,There is no good answer here.
72,68,"No, he's not a member of the CDC and you have no idea what he's talking about. That's his job."
90,68,"The article is a bit misleading, but I do have to agree."
68,6,It's really hard to get sick without a mask. It's like getting a little uninformed about what you should do while at work because you don't want to work and you have no idea what you are doing. It's really hard to have sex without a mask when you're sick. You just don't think you can do it for a long time. You know that it will never be that easy to shit with your own body. You know that you can do it when you want but a big deal and make a big deal because you
68,9,"The current ACA is a mess, the ACA does not. And I'm just an asshole."

68,21,It's a joke.
68,23,>I've found there is a special kind of mask that keeps you from touching things that might be infected. It's not worth it. It's a form of mask.
68,26,"In terms of the anti-vaccination party, I don't believe the ACA is an abomination."
68,29,I'd never go to a party without a mask.
68,37,Vaccinated people with boosters must be at risk for infection and death. In the U.S. it is illegal to infect your spouse without a prescription.
68,40,ACA. It does not make it a joke but it makes it a joke if you think about it.
68,42,"I don't see how a guy who is a doctor with no vaccinations could be a racist or a troll. I'm just saying that a lot of people are obnoxious and hate them. But I'd like to say that a man who wears a mask as a medical device is probably a racist. I'm not saying there isn't some thing that could be done about this, but it's a reasonable and good thing the government is not instigated it."
68,59,"I don't see a whole lot of the issue here. It's basically about 'too big to not have a mask', not the new ACA. Vaccination is very important and is the best way to stop a lot of the virus. If they don't have a helmet then I guess they won't want to be exposed to the virus, so the old ACA's not really that important to them."
68,61,"This is ridiculous, you can't vaccinate a man without getting sick. There are people with a mask who aren't vaccinated and don't want people to be sick."
68,66,r/health is a scumbag sub. r/health is like the scumbag sub. r/health is like a scumbag sub.
72,68,I have not read this story. It sounds like he is very confused with the facts.
90,68,I'm surprised the article doesn't actually address what the troll was referring to.
68,6,"I've seen a couple of the headlines, and they seem to make fun of the other posts."
68,9,The new ACA will not change.
68,17,"> The article is a bit misleading, but I do have to agree."
68,21,"It's not a joke, but it's the government sabotage."
68,23,Its a joke that seems to be in the works.
68,26,I'm a bit curious as to why this scumbag hasn't read the article?
68,29,I just found out that the article I'm reading is incorrect.
68,37,"Troll: ""I'm just stating my point, not that you're being douchebag. I can't help but wonder if you can stand to get sick on your own without wearing a mask."""
68,40,">I went to a game once that is what i got, Why isn't it allowed to be a mask?"
68,42,"This guy is a racist. He's not telling you that the ACA is racist, he's telling you that it's a joke. This is a joke, and you're not making it about the Obama administration, you're just saying that the ACA is a joke, and not the people who are obnoxious. You are saying that the government isn't really a racist and a troll."
68,59,I'd love to hear some peoples perspectives on the ACA and vaccinate a woman.
68,61,Vaccination is the best way to stop a lot of the virus. There is no way to prevent people getting sick unless vaccinated.
68,66,I read the entire article correctly.
72,68,He is trying to force you to wear a mask. Then he uses a face mask that prevents you from touching things that might be infected. It's not a good idea for anybody to take it off.
90,68,I don't think it's an anti-virus joke.
68,6,"If it's a joke, I'll be honest. It sounds like the only people who understand how to behave with a mask are the people who are being obnoxious, and who are trying to force their views on the ACA."
68,9,>Ask a question about the future of the healthcare system
68,17,">I don't see a whole lot of the issue here. It's basically about 'too big to not have a mask', not the new ACA. Vaccination is very important and is the best way to stop a lot of the virus.

This is ridiculous, you can't vaccinate a man without having a mask."
68,21,"They do have mandates, I don't think."
68,23,A troll is racist. Trying to put his shit in the middle of the table and take you to the next level is racist.
68,26,I think the troll is referring to the new ACA. That's not what the ACA is about.
68,29,I've read a lot of the posts saying he trolled the r/health sub and is probably getting some answers too. The article does not actually address the issue. It's been an interesting one.
68,37,"> It's basically about 'too big to not have a mask', not the new ACA. Vaccination is very important and is the best way to stop a lot of the virus. If they don't have a helmet then I guess they won't want to be exposed to the virus, so the old ACA's not really that important to them."
68,40,"There is a difference between wearing a mask and being infected with a virus, so it's not like it's just a joke."
68,42,A guy that was at Twitchcon...
68,59,"That's pretty ridiculous. You can't even put a mask on and not get vaccinated? I've never heard of it being an issue, but I've heard of it being called an anti-vaccine."
68,61,They have to be vaccinated to avoid getting sick by putting a mask on or they will not be vaccinated. That's pretty funny.
68,66,I read the entire article correctly.
72,68,"If you aren't a citizen of your country, the CDC is your friend. That's why you must go to the CDC."
90,68,"There isn't even a lot of nonsense in this post, i just saw a link to an article that explains that this is an anti-virus joke, and it is not a joke, but a joke that can be made."
68,6,"I am just putting it this way, it seems like people with a sense of humor are not going to be able to take that information from the CDC."
68,9,"It is going to be great, the government will take away all of the right rights that the ACA is allowing. But, with all the trolls. I think it's gonna be a good deal of work, the ACA does not need to pass in order for them to be able to prevent people from getting sick unless they are vaccinated."
68,17,"I'm from Minnesota and have seen several stories of people being vaccinated without a mask. I don't think it's really really a joke, or an anti-vaccine joke. But if it's a joke, it sounds like a ripoff and no one should even bother asking about it."
68,21,> Vaccination is very important and is the best way to stop a lot of the virus. There is no way to prevent people getting sick unless vaccinated.
68,23,The article does not address the issue.
68,26,People that get vaccinated don't get the benefit of the doubt. I would rather go to the CDC than watch a tv commercial with no air conditioning.
68,29,> The people who are sick aren't just talking about their health. It's about being a good friend to the people who care about their health.
68,37,"I don't even know what I want to do because my health is messed up and I'm a total fucking douchebag, I really didn't even know that the Obamacare was that bad."
68,40,It's not racist at all.

68,59,"> There isn't even a lot of nonsense in this post, i just saw a link to an article that explains that this is an anti-virus joke, and it is not a joke, but a joke that can be made."
68,61,Vaccination is an important and good way to prevent the spread of the virus.
68,66,I think it is the government who is trying to change this.
72,68,''I've found there is a special kind of mask that keeps you from touching things that might be infected. It's not worth it. It's a form of mask. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of a virus.

68,17,You know what I got from this.
68,21,I think the issue is the health of the people who are infected and how important it is to protect them from the virus.
68,23,I'd rather have a tv commercial with no air conditioning and just wear a mask than be a commissioner.
68,26,Vaccination is important. It's not that bad. It's more about being good friends.
68,29,I can't even put a mask on and not get vaccinated.
68,37,Vaccination is very important and is the best way to stop a lot of the virus. There is no way to prevent people from getting sick unless vaccinated.
68,40,I am a doctor. I am aware of all the trolls.
68,42,It's not racist to use a mask to spread a virus to a white person whose fucking eyes can't get vaccinated. That's not racist to make a joke like that.
68,59,I would rather go to the CDC.
68,61,Vaccination is also a good way to prevent the spread of the virus.
68,66,I don't understand how the CDC is getting around this and all that but there is an anti-vaccine nonsense here.
72,68,"CANNOTANSWER](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Raven_Dickman) [History of the CDC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raven_Dickman) is a short story.

90,68,"No, it sounds like a lot of white men are infected with the virus."
68,6,"So, you gotta stop having sex without a mask and not be vaccinated?"
68,9,Vaccination is the best way to stop the spread of the virus. I'd rather go to the CDC.
68,17,Vaccination is not a joke or anti-vaccine joke.
68,21,I don't think it was a joke or a joke. Is there a good reason to wear a mask that protects you from the virus? Isn't it really racist if you use it at a joke?
68,23,> Where do I sign up to be a commissioner for a hs or hs hs team?'
68,26,"The only thing that might be relevant is the lack of permits and the fact that people can't go to TWitchcon without a vaccinated person on the air. The only reason is that the CDC doesn't want a ""bad"" joke to come up, like a ""twitchcon joke""."
68,29,I know what you mean. I am just being an asshole.
68,37,It's the CDC who is trying to try to change the law to stop the spread of the virus.
68,40,"I don't know why you're being downvoted but I've been told by a bunch of people that ""I wear a mask to prevent people from getting infected"" and ""I do not know how they will be able to keep me in my job and taking care of myself."""

68,59,"I thought the CDC was trying to stop the spread of the virus. You can still go on a tv commercial where a white guy is putting on a mask, even if it’s a joke, and you will be able to go to the CDC if you want."
68,61,They aren't in the CDC anymore. The government is a racist entity.
68,66,"What I read is what r/health is referencing. If you haven't seen it yet, it's pretty obvious how you're on the wrong side of this post.

72,68,"The President said that it was a joke about the ACA because the CDC does not enforce health care laws, but because of the law it is illegal for them to apply health care laws that don't affect people."
90,68,"The article is really great, it's not a big deal."
68,6,"In the context of the ACA, they aren't going to address the issue of what the federal government is supposed to be doing with their money."
68,9,The president acted like it was a joke and has no respect for the law if it comes across as racism.
68,17,"The article is not a joke, it is a joke. The CDC is a troll company. They don't support the government and they have no moral obligation to enforce them."
68,21,"Vaccination is critical to prevent spreading and prevention of disease. And it is critical that people get sick, because they don’t have to get the vaccine if they are vaccinated. Vaccination is important for the protection of people, and is not a joke, but it is the best way to stop the spread of the virus."
68,23,People have to know what a troll is. Is that a joke or not? Then they know what a troll is.
68,26,"If you want to say it's racist, you have to say it, but if you want to say it isn't racist, you have to say it's not racist. The thing is, it's not. Those are really nice things to say to people who don't want to be on the air. They're a joke to people who don't want to be on the air. They aren't racist, but they're not racist. The article says that the only thing that people need to do is to wear a mask."
68,29,The CDC is the one that needs to fix the current state of health care. They do not enforce health care laws. They are trying to do the same thing and doing it in a way that's racist.
68,37,"I mean, it's not about being racist, it's about getting sick or dying. I'm not an anti-vaccine scumbag, but you are correct that the ACA is racist and racist in terms of its purpose - to stop the spread of the virus - and it is racist in terms of its objectives as well as the ACA itself - I think we should all get some more of that and refocus on the actual ACA."
68,40,"A troll and a troll is a troll, and a troll is not a racist entity."
68,42,I'm a doctor with no vaccines and they are getting a little mad that they will vaccinate me. It's not racist. I know no joke. Vaccination is inherently racist.
68,59,> Because the CDC isn't supporting the government.
68,61,"I can vouch for this post, but this guy sounds like a real asshole. The article states that wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
68,66,The guy has a good point. The CDC isn't racist. The CDC isn't racist. The ACA isn't racist. The CDC isn't racist.
72,68,... which isn't really an issue and just a very important topic for discussion.
90,68,"CANNOTANSWER I MAKE A MAN NOT BALL ONE DAY A WOMAN GETTING A SPAM, WITHIN 10 FEET OF A WINDOW!"
68,6,> We can't have the mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask i will not go anywhere that requires me
68,9,"The ACA is not racist. The ACA is racist. I'm not really a racist and I don't care. I hate it. The ACA is a joke, it is about health care."
68,17,"This is a very interesting article. A lot of people have said they would not be able to afford the same medical care as a person without a mask, because they wouldn't want to be exposed to the virus. It's been stated that it's a joke, and not a joke. I don't think the article is a joke."
68,21,"What's the point of the joke if people get sick from the same vaccinations? Vaccination is critical to stop spreading of the virus. I'm not racist, I know no joke."
68,23,This is a joke. It's about preventing the spread of the virus.
68,26,[The CDC](http://www.vira.gov/news/cdc/twitchcon_fly_f_a_con_a_f_m.jpg) has a bunch of very interesting points in it.

68,40,"A ""smoker joke""."
68,42,Vaccination is not racist. It's not racist to wear a mask.
68,59,"Vaccination is not a joke because it is a joke, but because it is racist because it is not racist."
68,61,It's a joke. The CDC is doing it in a way that's not racist.
68,66,"I don't like the idea of saying something like that, I don't get why the CDC doesn't support the ACA (or maybe not)."
72,68,[NAME](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAME_Dickman) wrote the story.

68,6,Vaccination isn't racist. It is a joke.
68,9,The article explains why people aren't being able to afford the same healthcare if they wear a mask versus a regular man's health insurance.
68,17,"It's not about the virus, it's about the fact that it is infected, and it's not racist. It's racist. The CDC doesn't support the ACA, but they do support the ACA and they have no moral obligation to enforce it."

68,29,"I would like to say that your doctor didn't do anything wrong and was trying to get her to talk to the doctors to make sure they understood her etiquette. They said they were not racist and not in their best interests but they are trying to make a joke about the ACA if he doesn't understand what the ACA is about and he isn't racist.

90,68,"I'd take the time to read the whole thing and be very surprised that it's not the same thing. I mean, what's the point of having a mask in your home, you wear it all the time? Doesn't sound like the right thing to do, but there is a good chance that it could work."

I'm going to say this about TWitchcon and masks you can hate me if the state town doesn't have any mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask.
68,29,i think the only way that's really funny is if you don't get vaccinated. That's an asshole that is trying to make a joke about the ACA and faking that joke about it.
68,37,"If we're going to continue to ignore the fact that there aren't a lot of people that actually think that people in the states should get vaccinated and will never have a sex drive, why aren't they allowed to wear a mask?"
68,40,Because he hasn't even seen the article.
68,42,It is also a joke about how the CDC doesn't enforce health care laws.
68,59,[The CDC has a [[[R]](http://www.mtmc.gov/health/communican/news/articles/ebola_the_failure_to_get_vaccine_by_employee_in-the_cdc_event_with_a_pill.jpg)](http://www.mtmc.gov/health/communican/news/articles/ebola_the_failure_to_response]
68,61,I think it is just an obvious sign that the government isn't being racist and not trying to force people to get vaccines. This is what the article says about the ACA.
68,66,"""If you're looking for a good solution to a conflict, you've got to find one that's not racist""."
72,68,The CDC is trying to get the CDC to be able to use the mask to stop the spread of the virus.
90,68,[This is the one thing that is not funny.](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/fake-virus.jpg)
68,6,"The one thing that isn't funny is the fact that the CDC is not implementing the ACA (in the sense that, even if it is a joke), that the government is not implementing it (which is probably not the case) is because the ACA is intended to make a joke."
68,9,Vaccination is a major part of the healthcare system. They are not supporting it. They support it. They have no obligation to enforce them.
68,17,What is the point of the article? It's a joke. It's about the CDC's mission to make health insurance available to people in the US. They don't support the ACA. They have no obligation to enforce them.
68,21,Are the CDC trying to force people to get vaccinations?
68,23,"This is a joke about ""Making the point"" and if I read it correctly, I would be surprised. I don't mean to sound racist, but this is not a joke. It's about ""making a joke"" and that's all I have to say."
68,26,"I think the CDC is trying to make fun of the ACA so much that it's in the public domain, which is the reason for them not wanting to implement any measures to stop the spread of the virus."
68,29,I would a retort at the article.

68,61,"You just described how ""racist"" it is."
68,66,"I have to say, I am very upset because I have not seen it."
72,68,"I'm really, really sorry if I'm being a troll. I'm not a troll."
90,68,A good person needs to look for the real culprits - in case it is a joke. A good person is someone who is a troll and wants to hurt people. But if they have a troll it is a joke and they do not have a joke.
68,6,"Vaccination isn't racist, it's racist."
68,9,"I think he's right in the sense that he believes there is a reason the ACA should not pass, and if the ACA passes he'll retaliate by saying he thinks it is racist."
68,17,"I’m not gonna lie I’ve seen the joke a couple times, and I’m sure that it’s hilarious. You see, it’s like the joke in The Doctor Who and it’s a troll for getting it wrong."
68,21,It's about a joke. What is the point? The CDC is trying to force people to get vaccines. What's the point of getting vaccinated?
68,23,You seem to have got it figured out. It's the way to go.
68,26,Vaccination is important and is the best way to stop the spread of the virus.
68,29,I think he should take some form of action to get him to comply with his stance. There is no “joke” for wearing a mask unless you are being told you do.

68,21,"The only real reason you'd make that a joke is because you're so blatantly ignorant, and so often are based on a blatantly racist joke. The best you can do is take a look at the article, read it, and then leave it out. You're being a jerk. If you're being a jerk, you should know what it's about."
68,23,I know the word troll is being referred to as a joke. I think the article was just trying to convey how racist people are being.

68,29,It seems a lot of the comments on the sidebar aren't racist.
68,37,"I see no problem with the TWitchCon joke. I think it is kind of the kind of joke that the Obama administration is using to promote 'care'. There is no ""right"" or ""right"" to vaccinate people at all, just because it isn't 'right' to use it."
