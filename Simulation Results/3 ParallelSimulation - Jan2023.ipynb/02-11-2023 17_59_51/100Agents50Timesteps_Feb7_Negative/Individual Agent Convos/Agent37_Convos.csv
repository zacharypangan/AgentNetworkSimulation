37,25,"I am not familiar with the details of this, but I was there on a date and it was quite different from when it was first issued, so it could not be anything different. I believe that this was done when the people that used the mask started using the ones that they have a contract with, like you are, bringing up. I know that's a pretty long story, but I do think it would be nice to talk to some of them about the new regulations."

61,37,"In order to stop a virus from spreading in Maryland, you must wear a mask. A mask is a piece of evidence that an individual with boosters is a 'vaccinated' person, if it will be possible. You need to wear a mask to stop this, you must be going to an event or event."

37,8,This doesn't go over well here in Virginia.
37,14,Wearing a mask in public places is a very good way to prevent people from contracting a virus. I don't see how that's the same thing as wearing a mask when you're at a concert.
37,20,> You know our right to die and infect (kill) others. Why isn't Ms. Ingraham out there with them.
37,22,This is a real shame. We have to start taking steps to stop this. The government has no rights over what it says.
37,25,[Not sure if he wants to say that in another comment but I did see it as a joke here].
37,31,It sounds like the government is a naive asshole.
37,36,Exactly what happens when you wear a mask?
43,37,It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
48,37,A lot of people have already commented that they're starting to get sick and don't think to change their masks.
49,37,"That's a good point - you're wearing a mask because you don't have the courtesy of a mask. You're wearing a mask because you've been infected with a virus, not because you're going to wear it."
61,37,"I've never actually been to the event at Twitchcon, but I can confirm - once they do do it - that they'll be making a blanket statement saying the same thing."

73,37,"> Its been very hard for me to believe that when you do the same thing with a team, you are actually playing better in the offseason. I am going to resign but i am going to keep doing a helmet-less practice, if the government doesn't want to see that.

76,37,"I'm sorry OP, I'm in New York City. We are so far north."
79,37,"Are the rules about wearing masks? Because we don't have one right to have the rules imposed by the government, and it seems that's not the policy."
82,37,"Yes, there are rules on the sd vaccine law. It's a cynical excuse to have a mask. Certainly not a mandate, but it's an unpopular opinion. There are many, many reasons why you'd want to be vaccinated without a mask. You're right that it's a terrible idea and I just don't get it."
83,37,...it's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
90,37,"In the US, we're banned from using masks, and if we don't do anything, we're allowed to do it, but the law and rule of law are based on a simple, non-violent law. The only way we can stop them is to not use them, and the law requires that they be removed from all or part of the home."
37,8,I'm not going to lie to anyone else. This is a serious case. The gov is the one who is violating the law. And I think we should get some new and specific stuff together.
37,14,"I agree with /r/republicans, but I have always been a huge supporter of the mask in the US and I really like it. It's a terrible idea and very bad."
37,20,This is a real shame. We have to start taking steps to stop this. The government has no rights over what it says.
37,22,You should be ashamed of yourself and the people you respect. But the government is a dick and should be put to work with.
37,25,People don't want to hear this. What's the matter with the government?
37,31,Basically you want to keep this a secret. If you are sick you don't need a mask.
37,36,Why don't we have to start taking steps to stop this. The government has no rights over what it says.
43,37,You don't get an anti-virus vaccine.
48,37,"It's not illegal to wear a mask to help get sick, but I don't think it's illegal to put on a mask if you want to get sick."
49,37,''The people that get virus are really just the people who are infected with it.''

68,37,Vaccinated people with boosters in the U.S. must be at risk for infection and death. In the U.S. it is illegal to infect your spouse without a prescription.
73,37,"Is it in the rules that it has to be worn every season, or is it a special one?"
76,37,"That's what a medical term is for. There are many, many ways to prevent the spread of a virus."
79,37,If we can't wear masks we should use a mask.
82,37,">You can hate me if the state town doesn't have an mandates you can't get mad that an event doesn't have any mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask '. That's a very good point. In the end, the state is merely trying to impose a mandate on the individual. You can't 'blame' the state for having a mandate on a particular person."
83,37,The government doesn't want you in their homes.
90,37,">They are trying to protect others from the dangers of disease, like you're saying. You can't wear a mask without a mask. If you really want to, get out and kill them all, and go to a hospital, it isn't going to work out."

37,22,"""Uhm, the mask isn't the answer. I can't really answer it. I can't answer the question that's always coming up. I need to figure out whether I need to wear it. I need to find out why people think the government is wrong and can't make any other policy change besides having to tell people to change the law. We need to start moving and moving. We need to be in the clear and the only one who really wants to change is the government. That's our right to protect us against illness. We need to change the law. I"
37,25,We have to start taking steps to stop this. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
37,31,It's also illegal for people to wear masks. It's a very common issue among Americans.
37,36,Is there a good link to that quote?
43,37,The president has nothing to do with the anti-virus movement. His actions are what led to his presidency.
48,37,This is not really the correct answer.
49,37,"''I'm a person with a fever, so I don't know what to say. I'm going to have to say what I know.'''"
61,37,"I want to say that I am afraid to say this. You have a lot of work to do. You don't have to go to the event, you have to work to get the job. You are in the wrong. You aren't doing the right thing."
64,37,I can only assume that when you tell the truth. You can't be sick if you don't wear a mask.
66,37,"I think the fact that he's being a scumbag makes him a scumbag, because he's a scumbag, doesn't make him a scumbag."
67,37,Are you going to tell your current manager that he is not interested in this game? Because he is not interested in this game. He is not going to know the difference. He isn't going to see the difference.
68,37,I don't see why youre being a douchebag here.
73,37,"Is it in the rules that it has to be worn every season, or is it a special one? Because I'm not a fan of the whole ACA thing so..."

37,8,"Obama has a lot to do with the anti-virus movement. He was a powerful candidate on the 2016 presidential campaign, and I don't really think he embodies his agenda."
37,14,"In a lot of ways, the mask in the US is just for the sake of protecting people. People wear it all the time, but not when people don't have it. This is one of the reasons we're not using the mask."
37,20,I'm going to make sure this makes more sense.
37,22,">Is it in the rules that it has to be worn every season, or is it a special one? Because he is not interested in this game."
37,25,"The government has the right to make changes, and not to go to any more meetings and events. They can't."
37,31,Why would he keep a secret? That's why he's the president.
37,36,The CIA had some very serious problems with this policy. The one about the ACA. It's a very big deal because they're trying to stop the spread of a virus in Taiwan.
43,37,It's not a fucked up question. Is there a reason why you wear a mask?
48,37,"If this were a joke, it wouldn't be the most important question in the whole article."
49,37,Well...it's not just a virus. It's a disease that could be spread by a large number of people. The CDC has a huge problem with this. They don't understand how people aren't able to know how to prevent the spread of this disease.
61,37,"This guy, I think, is naive."
64,37,"I think they are wrong, but I'd be very concerned if they tried to force people to get vaccinations, especially if it's a scam involving a government-managed medical device called a mask. They need to keep the masks."
66,37,"I have heard of ""afaik"", which is a term relating to how the government keeps trying to stop the spread of a virus. It's like that. But if a person is infected, that is an issue that is already being addressed by an official. I think if a player isn't wearing a mask, he might be trying to get his point across a little more clearly. If he's being a scumbag, I think he's just trying to get to the root of the problem."
67,37,"He sounded a bit fucking naive, but the next time he says something shady like ""I love the way this game is supposed to work i think it's the best way to get in shape, and i really like the way the players are dressed to play it""..."
68,37,"If I were you, I would go to the TWitchcon. I don't get it, I just want to make sure people aren't going to get sick in the future. I'm just stating my point, not that you're being douchebag. I'm just saying you're being a douchebag, I can't help but wonder if you can stand to get sick on your own without wearing a mask."
73,37,"You should know that there is no law preventing people from doing this. In fact, it's an idea which is being used by the US government to prevent people from putting on masks."
76,37,"If it's not a crime, then it doesn't matter."
79,37,"The law isn't about it, it's about the state of the system and the health care system itself. It's about the government's control over the government."
82,37,"I'm just going to start by saying, ""Why don't you take a mask and wear it in public to the event?"""
83,37,"i agree with everyone that i see the prank. it's the afaik thing, but not the prank part."
90,37,I don't think this has anything to do with racism.
37,8,"""He's the president."""
37,14,I don't think this has anything to do with racism. I think it has to do with the fact that this is a shady idea that is being used to help spread the virus.
37,20,It's not racist to wear a mask. It's a prank.
37,22,"The people who are wearing the masks are doing their part, as it is the game itself."
37,25,I don't see how this has anything to do with racism.
37,31,"I'm a fan of the shit out of this guy, but I am too scared to put on a mask if I do get sick."
37,36,That's a very valid point and it's not a shady quote.
43,37,"Yes, I agree that a mask is required by law to protect the body, not to take the players with them."
48,37,I think we should have some kind of medical and educational program where people can get vaccinated and tell the world what's going on.
49,37,"It's a bit confusing to me, but I've heard that it's a joke, a joke, and a joke. I can't think of anything more cliche than saying this. Is there any type of humor in a joke?"
61,37,"Unless you're a liar, I don't think this guy is a naive fool. He's just using his mind to help people who are not a virus to be able to get vaccines. Whether it's an abomination, or a way to hide it from the government, he's a naive fool."
64,37,>But I still prefer to wear my mask in my office. You can’t help but notice my mouth watering in a few seconds as it’s in my throat.
66,37,"So this isn't a scam, it's a scam."
67,37,"What I think is interesting is that ""He was a shady coach and he is not interested in this game."" I think that if a teacher tells a student to go on a game with his teammates that ""I love the way this game is supposed to work i think it's the best way to get in shape"" and that he wears a mask, and then tells the players ""He likes the way the players are dressed to play it"", the manager's response is ""I will be a shady dick move."""
68,37,Vaccinated people with boosters must be at risk for infection and death. In the U.S. it is illegal to infect your spouse without a prescription.
73,37,It's only a joke.

79,37,"I don't know if you are a political scientist, but afaik has a way of saying something like that in an idiom. It's the joke that they are trying to make. But as you say, it's not about the state of the system and the health care system itself. It's about the government's control over the government."
82,37,I don't know the other lawyers in this thread. It would be more difficult for a lawyer to understand what is going on.
83,37,"The only reason the government has banned this in the first place is because it's a joke, not because of the lack of publicity. It's just that people in countries like China have done it before."
90,37,"... and the fact that a billion people live in the US doesn't make me think that I'm right. I think this is an interesting theory about the relationship between a terrorist and a human being.

37,36,"This is a great point for a joke, but it’s not a shady one."
43,37,"And now that you mention it it seems like I've found some truth to this quote. Apparently, people are being ""dangerous"" for not being able to get vaccines at the CDC and the NFL."
48,37,"As I said, if this were a joke, it wouldn't be the most important question in the whole article. You think that putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things things i've done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table."
49,37,So... they're doing it out of spite.

Then we went to the TWickcon again a year later and we were able to make a video about them going to TWickCon. We were there to make a fun joke, and it was funny."
64,37,I’m pretty sure the government doesn’t just need you to wear a mask.
66,37,The CDC doesn't want to prevent people from getting flu shot and they are rushing the vaccination. This is a scam.
67,37,Is the fact that you don't like wearing a mask a bad thing?

90,37,That's my view. It's just the craziest joke I've ever heard. People think that if they are a terrorist or infected then their 'no' shit is a joke.

64,37,"My father, who works in the military, used to be a doctor. His wife, who now carries the same mask, says he's ""a little apprehensive"" of me because I'm afraid the guy that has a few kids might get sick and end up in a lot of trouble...."
66,37,The CDC is not the only one.
67,37,It's a joke. You don't like wearing a mask.
68,37,"> It's basically about 'too big to not have a mask', not the new ACA. Vaccination is very important and is the best way to stop a lot of the virus. If they don't have a helmet then I guess they won't want to be exposed to the virus, so the old ACA's not really that important to them."
73,37,"A ACA is a joke, but you can make the whole thing up."
76,37,Wearing a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i've ever done in my entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things.
79,37,The NSA and CDC are in the same country. It's the only country that has a policing system.
82,37,I don't see why you think that 'the president' isn't a racist.
83,37,They have a few reasons they are not okay with it and don't want you to wear them because of a prank.
90,37,"This is not about the terrorists, it's about the people."
37,8,This ain’t a joke. This isn’t about the government. This is about the people.
37,14,"[NAME] : ""The CDC is not the only one. The whole idea of having to wear a mask is a bad joke."""
37,20,>I think this is one of the reasons Trump has been so racist.
37,22,You have no right to wear a mask in public.
37,25,I believe that this is one of the reasons Trump has been so racist. That a troll is being shady is an absolutely horrible joke.
37,31,"That's a joke, y'know?"
37,36,"''This isn’t a joke. I don’t see why you think that ‘the president’ isn’t racist. They have a few reasons they are not okay with it and don’t want you to wear them because of a prank. This is not about the terrorists, it’s about the people."
43,37,"Is there any evidence that the CDC and the NFL are really being racist, and not just fake jokes?"
48,37,"It is a joke and the CDC has no problem preventing any virus spreading there. It's one of the most dangerous things to get sick on a regular basis. Moreover, it would be the least safe thing to do in a world where you don't get to go into an infection."
49,37,"Isn't it the same doctor or the doctor who got you infected with a virus that the cops wanted to keep from making the same joke, or is the doctor just not interested in being infected with a virus? Or are the cops concerned that the guy had to be a doctor in order to get vaccinated?"
61,37,"It's a joke. It's like the ""what if I got a narwhal mask when i was 14."" argument."
64,37,This is a bit of an over the top joke. I wouldn't want to make it seem like I'm trying to make it sound like I'm somehow a bad person. Vaccination is important to protect people from the spread of a virus. I think that's a big part of what is needed besides keeping the vaccines current and infected.
66,37,"I just wanted to add that I'm a lawyer, so I'll be sure to say, ""I've never heard of a person who would be the most fooled by this. This is not a scam."
67,37,"If this is a story, it's not about the school. It's about the football."
68,37,"I don't even know what I want to do because my health is messed up and I'm a total fucking douchebag, I really didn't even know that the Obamacare was that bad."
73,37,'Coach' is the guy who is getting an ACA and trying to make the ACA work.
76,37,Is this why you have no doctor contact information? Is there any way for them to get your blood count and get you vaccinated?
79,37,The fact that he's being nice to the people that are wearing him is so funny. It's funny and a prank. I know it's not a joke but he's trying to be a dick. It's funny but it's a prank. He is being narcissistic.
82,37,"You are being racist. I am not an expert on vaccines, but I am aware of the consequences of your choice. This is the right thing to do."
83,37,"What's the problem here if you're going to be told that ""afaik"" is a joke? Is it a joke? The government has banned it because it is a joke. It's a joke, a joke, a joke."
90,37,"If you're using a mask to kill people with a mask, this will not be a joke."
37,8,If I read it the way he did it was to keep you invisited (I don't know how much he's getting)
37,14,i really think that's one of the reasons for not wearing a mask.
37,20,It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
37,22,Vaccination is important to protect people from the spread of a virus.
37,25,"It's a joke, I believe if you're using a mask to kill people with a mask, this will not be a joke."
37,31,...and the cops aren't going to be able to get you vaccinated?
37,36,"It's a joke, isn't it?"
43,37,The whole point of this quote was to sabotage the government's ability to prevent the spread of the virus.
48,37,"This is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I hate to say this but the person said something like: ""We lost a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam. You have to be ready to do all of the stupid things that I've done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table."
49,37,I don't think they'd ever actually let anybody else do it.
61,37,"i think it's a joke that has a lot of points, and i love all those."
64,37,"The government is making you sick. People need to stop saying they have AIDS. If they have AIDS, they are more likely to get sick. Vaccination is the answer to this problem."
66,37,I've never heard of a person who would be the most fooled by this. This is not a scam.
67,37,A lot of schools have this shit-bag policy that can be used to deter the spread of a virus. A lot of schools suck it up. I think I'll just tell your boss.
68,37,Vaccination is very important and is the best way to stop a lot of the virus. There is no way to prevent people from getting sick unless vaccinated.
73,37,"The whole ACA is a joke, but it's not being used to stop the spread of the ACA."
76,37,Vaccination is about being able to prevent the spread of a virus. Putting on a mask and getting vaccinated is a very simple and very good thing.
79,37,"The point isn't that the NSA is the only country with a policing system. They're doing it as part of Obamacare, not that they want people to be vaccinated. But they're actually talking about the government's control of the government."
82,37,"I read a good book about this recently and there were a lot of stories of people who didn't actually get vaccinations, and I know that I was one of them, but I don't think the vaccines were much of a deal breaker because it wasn't used as much to prevent or protect from vaccines."
83,37,It was the whole point of the article - the prank is only the worst of the problem and they aren't going to ban it because they are afraid of it. The prank in the article is a joke. It's not even a joke and they have no reason to ban it because it's a joke. The prank is a joke. They aren't allowed to ban it because it is a joke.
90,37,"Isn't it a big deal, and it's a joke? Not really a big deal."
37,8,The prank in the article is a joke. They have no right over what it says.
37,14,A lot of schools have this shit-bag policy that can be used to deter the spread of the virus.
37,20,"There's a book about this that I read recently called, ""Ingraham's Plan: Protecting Americans from HIV/AIDS"", focusing on this: How to avoid HIV/AIDS, and the ACA preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS, in addition to all of the health problems caused by HIV/AIDS."
37,22,I've never heard of a person who would be the most fooled by this. I think I'll just tell your boss.
37,25,That is a horrible joke.
37,31,> The whole ACA is a joke
37,36,Vaccination is only a joke. This is not a joke.
43,37,Why is that? You are being sarcastic and ignorant.
48,37,... and the CIA is a troll.
49,37,"It's one of the reasons why you are the holder of the ID card, and then you do it. The CDC has made it illegal for people to get vaccines as long as they are covered. The fact that you are the holder of ID cards doesn't mean you can't get vaccinated, but they are required to do so."
61,37,Vaccination is a good way to prevent the spread of the virus. Please wear masks.
64,37,Is it a joke? I'm a medical director and I'm so sorry to say this blew my mind.
66,37,"""Um, in Canada, I don't think this has much to do with the people who don't have the vaccine, which is a scam."""
67,37,>A lot of schools have this shit-bag policy that can be used to deter the spread of a virus.
68,37,It's the CDC who is trying to try to change the law to stop the spread of the virus.
73,37,A rash and the fear of injury is going to cause major health problems and the lack of awareness is starting to make people more ill than usual.
76,37,"They're using the restraining order to stop the spread of a virus. The government doesn't have the power to control the spread of a virus. They want to re-enforce it. You can get vaccinated and your privacy is protected. It's interesting that this is on reddit. It's like a ""Scumbag"" sub. The government has done a lot of things to help the problem."
79,37,"The CDC is going to get to the end of this month, and will have a slam on government."
82,37,I like to read the articles about how people are taking part in these troll groups and how the people who do this are being targeted.
83,37,I think it is a joke because it is about the US government. If you were to wear a mask in public for no reason it is an acceptable joke.
90,37,You can't get a real vaccine in this country if you're a terrorist. It's illegal to use a mask for a variety of purposes but it's certainly illegal.
37,8,I think the real issue is with the US government being a prankster to keep people from using fake ID cards because of their medical credentials and the fact that it is illegal to wear a mask in public without permission.
37,14,I'm sorry but the CDC is the one trying to change the law that is going to kill people.
37,20,"It's also illegal for the CDC to make people with ID cards wear masks unless they have a special privilege to get their vaccinations, so it can be used to stop the spread of a virus."
37,22,I'd say it's more a joke than a joke.
37,25,"He was trying to keep us safe from getting vaccinated. Ingraham is trying to get rid of the vaccine as soon as possible, to try and bring it up to the public."
37,31,Trump and his anti-war rhetoric are on a pedestal right now. We'll have to get out of our way as a country and move forward with the new ACA
37,36,"The problem of that is that the government wants to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS, and is trying to snoop on people who don't have them because they don't want to be vaccinated."
43,37,"You seem to be having an epiphany when this post becomes a bit of a bullshit. I'd rather say 'The president has nothing to do with the anti-virus movement. His actions are what led to his presidency', rather than 'I'm a lawyer and would rebut it until this nonsense stops.'"
48,37,"""We have to be ready to do all of the stupid things that I've done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table."""
49,37,I think the fact that you cannot keep locked in is actually the cause of this. You've already seen the point of the aforementioned joke - a doctor might have been involved.
61,37,"In addition to 'I'm going to say this about twitchcon and masks you can hate me if the state town doesn't have any mandates', and 'In order to stop a virus from spreading in Maryland, you must wear a mask."
64,37,I'm gonna get on the Internet.
66,37,"There's a bit of evidence that vaccinations aren't necessary, and there are more evidence that a mask isn't required than a visor."
67,37,"It is interesting how a couple of articles are about a ""shady"" behavior of a coach, e.g. : a coach is being a bit naive, but his response is that he isn't interested in this game because he doesn't like it."
68,37,This is a really interesting fact. How much of this you seem to think is being downvoted to hell?
73,37,"I am in the US Navy and have been to Florida three times and they have never refused to comply. And the people in that area are just the best at what they do. They're great at what they do, and it shows. The other people in this thread have also been more concerned about the fact that this isn't a joke."
76,37,This guy was in a real life situation.
79,37,"The truth is: We're in a world where everyone knows it's a joke, but we're in a world where the truth isn't that important."
82,37,"Vaccines are not a problem. Vaccines are not a problem. The problem is if you keep an unvaccinated person inside the government's house, the government can't do so."
83,37,"The CIA and NSA are doing something wrong, which is why sex is illegal. What's a prank? Because he doesn't actually believe it's funny. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of a virus."
90,37,"People with vaccines use fake masks to prevent the spread of a virus and there is no such thing as a 'good joke' about it, especially not about a joke."
37,8,"What's the point of a joke? This isn't a joke and you guys are wrong, but your own post is one of the most logical."
37,14,You could do worse. The CDC and other agencies who want to stop people from getting vaccinated are putting the same effort and effort into promoting people to get vaccines. So I don't see how these things will be used in the future.
37,20,"The president is trying to stop the spread of the virus by going to TWitchcon. You guys are just going to be doing all sorts of dumb things on this subreddit, and I would hate to be the first to say that I would hate to hear this."
37,22,"The idea of the ACA is that there are no guarantees of privacy, which in theory has no effect on the outcome of such a move. It is likely that even if the government is working to stop that, people will not be able to actually use it."
37,25,"Well, we're going to get off of this one."
37,31,No way to get rid of that joke. I think I know some people that haven't even heard of it.
37,36,"""Well, I know that it's not really a joke, but... I don't think they're trying to force the government to take care of this problem. We need to start doing things."""
43,37,Vaccine is the only way to stop the spread of a virus. You're telling me that when you get an infection you are getting a full blown viral infection.
48,37,I'm really sorry you are experiencing a lot of these issues and you seem to have a very hard time putting it in a context that you don't understand.
49,37,"As it happens, I'm still a troll."
61,37,The CDC is not doing anything about it. It's doing nothing to protect the people that have HIV.
64,37,There's a joke that makes you wear masks and not wear masks for the whole world to see? I'm gonna get on the Internet.
66,37,Afaik is a joke.
67,37,"I'd say that if a coach tells a student to go on a game with his teammates that ""I love the way this game is supposed to work i think it's the best way to get in shape, and i really like the way the players are dressed to play it"". It's pretty much a joke, it's just a joke, it's just one of those things that people who want to help other people with their health are trying to fix, and they're trying to make them work better."
68,37,I don't think you know what to say.
73,37,Vaccination isn't a joke. The entire idea of it being a joke is a joke. The entire idea of it being a joke is a joke. The entire idea of it being a joke is a joke and there's no way it's being true.
76,37,No one else is saying that a concussion was a problem because he got stuttering.
79,37,Vaccines are a good idea but they aren't really what they were made for.
82,37,This is a petty shitshow. The president is racist and he is the right guy.
83,37,"I don't know why you're being offended, but I'm really going to get some reassurance here."

37,14,This is an interesting theory about the relationship between a terrorist and a human being.
37,20,It is an interesting theory about the relationship between a terrorist and a human being.
37,22,Why does it have to be worn every season? I'd say it's more a joke than a joke.

68,37,Vaccination is very important and is the best way to stop a lot of the virus. Why not just go to the CDC and get some health advice if you have one?
73,37,A joke is just a joke.
76,37,This is not what's being said.
79,37,"He's trying to be narcissistic by not wearing a mask and saying something like, ""Afaik is a joke."""
82,37,This is just like a lot of bad white comments.
83,37,"I think he has the right to prank, but there is a difference between putting on a mask and putting on a mask. In other words, if a prank is really a prank, and it's a joke, it's probably just going to get worse, which is why the CIA is getting a bad rap and the NSA is getting worse and worse."
90,37,I think you're being a troll.
37,8,No. Just that the government is the one who is violating the law. And you think they're in the minority?
37,14,"Vaccination is the most important part of the US health system, but it isn't the most important. A mask is only good for people who are sick. I think that masks are not enough to stop the spread of viruses."
37,20,Vaccination is the only way to stop the spread of the virus. It is an important part of any job. I can't see them being a good idea.
37,22,The masks are meant to protect people from HIV. The CDC is not supposed to protect against the spread of the virus.
37,25,The whole point of putting on a mask is to be narcissistic. Its a joke. Its a joke. And then a prank like this spawns the same things in all of America and makes the government go after it. Its a joke.
37,31,Vaccination is the only way to stop the spread of a virus. It is a joke. It is the only way to stop the spread of a virus. It is a joke.
37,36,I'm sorry but the only thing I know is that we can't do anything about this.
43,37,I think the main issue is that when someone who says it was a joke has to say it isn't a joke and a joke isn't meant to be a joke.
48,37,"CDC has no problem preventing any virus spreading there. It's one of the most dangerous things to get sick on a regular basis. Moreover, it would be the least safe thing to do in a world where you don't get to go into an infection."

It's funny but it's a joke. It sounds like they're both lying. Vaccines are a good idea but they aren't really what they were made for. It's very similar to saying:
82,37,"It’s not a joke, it’s a joke."
83,37,"I mean, there is a lot of sarcasm there if you're joking. I mean, if you're just going to say it's funny and not just for being a joke then it's really not a joke. The best way to stop a virus is to start a new one in your hometown, and then, as you say, start making a lot of other stupid jokes and pretending to be sick - you know, like fuck off and tell yourself. Then, if you're doing something like that"
90,37,"The government is obligated to do whatever they want with the people around them. The CIA can do whatever they want, so there isn't anything to be said in an uninformed, uninformed or uninformed person. It is illegal for a man to be a terrorist but that doesn't mean it isn't racist."
37,8,"In my opinion, if a terrorist is really going to cause a problem in the government, they aren't going to do anything to stop them."
37,14,"The CDC is trying to impose a minimum amount of ""everybody is doing it. This is a joke."
37,20,I'm going to a medical center right now. What's the time?
37,22,You have to be ashamed of yourself and the people you respect. But the government is a dick and should be put to work with.

37,36,We’ve done something about this all our lives and it’s funny and funny and funny but not racist.
43,37,"If you have a problem with the government, there's something wrong with it."
48,37,I can relate to this comment in a manner that I think is funny and that he is the one apologizing to the CIA for preventing and stopping the spread of the Zika virus.
49,37,This is the first time I've heard people say this. They're pointing out the obvious. This is a joke.
61,37,Vaccination is a good way to stop the spread of HIV. Please wear masks.
64,37,Vaccination is important to prevent the spread of a virus.
66,37,> Ingraham is also the only one with a headband too
67,37,So... I'm asking to find out if this is a joke?
68,37,"""The CDC is trying to change the law to protect the US from terrorists and is trying to prevent them from getting vaccines without being in the vaccine."
73,37,So you don't know what this is a joke and just think it's a joke.
76,37,Weird thing is. I'm in a real life situation.
79,37,I'd rather have the job of a doctor.
82,37,"Vaccines are not a joke. They're a joke. I'm sure you're not going to get trolled, but they don't have to be legal, or illegal. They just don't have to be legal. Vaccines are a joke."

Then, if you're doing something like that"
90,37,I think the whole point of using it is that you're in fact a troll because you're an asshole.
37,8,Vaccination is the main goal. The government is not doing anything.
37,14,The CDC is trying to change the law to stop the spread of Zika.
37,20,It's not racist to wear a mask without a mask.
37,22,I'm not going to get into it. :(
37,25,I would have just had a conversation with the people around me and ask them what they are talking about.
37,31,"It's not just about a joke. It's about the government. It's about the threat of spreading HIV, it's about the threat of decriminalizing terrorism."
37,36,No. Vaccination is not a joke.
43,37,"I don't think there's anything wrong with this but I believe it's kind of funny. The jokes are funny and funny. Basically if he says I think it's funny, he's a racist joke. The CDC is very good at explaining what they are saying."
48,37,"This article does not contradict any of the other questions I said. In a hypothetical, the article specifically states that if a person isn't getting vaccinated, they could not continue doing what was deemed to be a joke."
49,37,Vaccination is a prank. It's a joke. It's a joke.
61,37,"I'm not a doctor, but a lot of people still believe they are sick and are in need of their health insurance because their husband went to Twitchcon and he said he could get the vaccine at that age. I'm not a doctor, but I still believe he can prevent HIV by getting his vaccinations. And since he was told it would prevent AIDS in Maryland and didn't go to TWickcon, he's a narcissist based on the internet."
64,37,This is a prank and I just want to say that my wife is a prankster.
66,37,"I’m going to rephrase this one because I think there are a lot of things to do. And they are all part of the joke, but none of them make sense."
67,37,I don't think people are being 'helpful' by saying I love the way the games work and I really like the way the players are dressed to play.
68,37,"I am sorry to say but I can't comment on that because I don't understand why people don't get vaccines. If a vaccinated person with boosters isn't at risk of getting sick without a prescription, they can't get the vaccine. But this is why people don't wear masks."
73,37,"I think the best way to break this joke is to not wear a mask, but to wear a mask."
76,37,I'm surprised you don't have a ctrl A. (nor does yours) and have a ctrl A. (nor does it have a ctrl A)
79,37,The NSA and CDC are not in the same country. They are not policing the government. They are operating on the same principle as any other policing authority.
82,37,And what's the matter here? The government doesn't know how to make a joke. They just want people to go and make jokes about vaccinations. It's a joke about vaccines not working.
83,37,"""Afaik is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. The truth is that a prank that is actually a joke is a prank. If you go back and look at the wiki article about the CIA, you'll find that it's a prank, and not a joke."
90,37,A terrorist is a parasite. They aren't overreacting. They aren't overreacting. They're not overreacting. I don't think it's a joke. Is this what's going on? How would people act when you have a virus?
37,8,I feel like you're giving the most basic and common sense answers here.
37,14,Is this what you say about the CDC?
37,20,The CDC has no right over what they say.
37,22,"It's not a joke, it's a joke. You just have to wear a mask. If you want to get infected, wear a mask."
37,25,The government has the right to make changes to stop the spread of a virus.The CDC is trying to change the law to stop the spread of Zika. It's not racist to wear a mask without a mask. I'm not going to get into it.
37,31,The CDC is not operating on the same principle as any other policing authority. Is that correct?
37,36,"In the article I linked, a woman in a twilight movie wrote about the effect of a mask on your face and said it's ok to not wear a mask."
43,37,"The CDC is trying to get the people to wear masks, but not in the USA. It's a really good idea if you really believe that if you can afford a mask and get a vaccine and your immune system gets wiped out, then they are right to take you to jail."
48,37,"... ""I feel like I swore my life would be better if I was a politician."", ""I think it's actually pretty stupid. People are more open to making a joke than a joke."
49,37,That's kind of one of those parts of the joke. I'd be a bit skeptical to ask the question because it sucks - if a doctor wasn't involved there'd be a huge problem with this.
61,37,The government is trying to be funny here. It is an amazing way to stop the spread of HIV. A guy who has a mask is a nutjob and a naive fool and is the naive one.
64,37,"The whole thing is BS. The government has no reason to be on the receiving end of the problem. If you say that your wife was a prankster, then you are being wrong."
66,37,"The whole point of a mask is to keep the CDC and NSA safe. But if they don't want you to do it they won't give you the pass. ""Well, I do like to wear a mask, I think I might need to wear one now."""
67,37,"So you are not being helpful here, or something like that."
68,37,Vaccination is an important part of the healthcare system.
73,37,It's a joke. The other part is a joke.
76,37,I've a problem with this.
79,37,"The president has repeatedly said this in the past, and it's obvious to me that this is a serious case. The president hasn't said anything to this particular person and if the president deems himself to be a dick or funny, he's simply putting a 'dick' in the middle of the issue."
82,37,Is it a joke or something? Is it a joke or something?
83,37,What was the point of the article?
90,37,I'm talking about the ''what if'' jokes about being a terrorist. Using a mask doesn't automatically make you a terrorist. You are literally saying you don't think that. You are being a troll because you are a parasite. The fact that you're a terrorist isn't just a joke. That is an interesting theory about the relationship between a terrorist and a human being. It is a joke and an interesting premise.
37,8,"As a US citizen, this is exactly the type of thing I want to see and understand."
37,14,The government is being ridiculous about it.
37,20,So we need to stop taking steps to stop it?
37,22,"I don't know if this is a joke, or that this is a joke."
37,25,Vaccination is an important part of the healthcare system. It's an amazing way to stop the spread of a virus.
37,31,"I am not sure if this is relevant, but as a matter of fact, this is the most recent example of a national emergency. If you think it's a joke, the CDC has a few solutions to the issue. That's why they're doing it."
37,36,So your problem is that you are being silly?
43,37,The only thing that is really funny in this subreddit is that the government and medical providers are not saying it is the best way to stop the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of the virus. Please wear masks.
48,37,The article states that putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i ve done in my entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table.
49,37,"As a citizen of the US I'd not be surprised if you have to wear a mask, you don't want to get a bit of the joke."
61,37,"I would like to congratulate you for bringing back the first part of the joke, saying a mask is a joke."
64,37,It doesn't matter whether or not you are a joke. It's a prank. You are being a prankster.
66,37,Vaccination is supposed to be a great tool for the population.
67,37,CANNOTANSWER FACT: AIDS is a CDC disease that causes people to have a panic attack and other illnesses. AIDS has been associated with AIDS for a long time now and it is not a CDC infection.
68,37,"""Hey, the CDC is attempting to change the law to stop the spread of a virus. They are trying to stop the spread of the virus. In the ACA's we aren't allowed to infect the elderly. They don't allow children infected. They don't allow women infected in the U.S. to infect anyone except the elderly."""
73,37,I don't think you're being funny. You seem to be being very kind.
76,37,It's a joke.
79,37,"There is a joke here. The people who want to go to a prank party have just become a bunch of fucking idiots, just like most other people on this subreddit. They're both being racist. They can't make a joke about it."
82,37,That's an awesome idea.
83,37,"That's really, really funny."
90,37,"It's just a joke, because that's a joke."
37,8,"Because they want to use a mask on people. So, I would say it's a joke."
37,14,"I know, it's not like that's really a joke, it's just not a joke."
37,20,A man who likes a mask can do better than a man who doesn't like a mask and has to wear it in public.
37,22,Vaccination is one of the most important part of the healthcare system. It's an amazing way to stop the spread of a virus.
37,25,What exactly do you think about a mask being considered racist? I mean I didn't say anything about it or the people it was made about. I'm sure we're all racists so this isn't really racist at all.
37,31,"Is there a joke about the government saying things like ""If you are sick you don't need a mask.""?"
37,36,Vaccination is an important part of the healthcare system. It's an amazing way to stop the spread of a virus.
43,37,"This is a troll story about an anti-virus virus, which is a joke from a guy who's trying to get a virus. There's no joke about it. And if you look at the article the CDC is actually trying to convince people to get the virus."
48,37,Vaccination is a joke. But it’s a joke because the government is trying to prevent the spread of the virus. Vaccination is a joke.
49,37,">I don't think I'm gonna be able to get a hold of any of these people, it would be a pretty good way to do so."
61,37,"The joke isn't a joke, it's a joke."
64,37,I am just kidding. It's a joke. Isn't it a prank? You are being a joke.
66,37,We're going to start with the nannying and the realizing the CDC doesn't want people getting a faik.
67,37,"Vaccination is an important part of any job. The government has no power or power, and their actions are nothing but a prick."
68,37,This is an anti-vaccine joke that is made up by a racist.
73,37,> Vaccination is a joke because it's illegal to take people to hospitals where it's illegal to handle that issue.
76,37,"So the word 'we's not doing anything wrong' would be 'you don't want to eat sick people', as in 'you don't want to eat sick people'? That's what the premise of AMA was.... And it's not the government's incompetence."
79,37,Vaccines aren't a joke. It's a joke. It isn't a joke.
82,37,"> Is a mask part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.... is being a joke? No. You can get vaccinated, just like anyone else, and the vaccines are a good idea."
83,37,"This is a joke. There is a prank being spelled ""I don't believe it's funny."""
90,37,That's a pretty good one. I thought he thought the joke wasn't racist.
37,8,This is a joke. I'm just kidding.
37,14,Vaccines are an important part of the healthcare system. I don't think it's just being a joke.
37,20,"If I was president, I would not have the confidence to wear a mask in public, even if they had no right. I'm going to ask them if there's a chance that a real person is using it in public, and they'll say ""yes, it's the best way to stop this."""
37,22,I can't believe the headline.
37,25,"This isn't a joke, it's an article written by a racist. The joke isn't racist, it's racist."
37,31,I thought it was a joke.
37,36,"As I recall, a man who says he doesn't want to wear a mask is getting the virus."
43,37,What do you think of the CDC saying that the biggest problem is the health of the players and a lack of public awareness?
48,37,"If I remember correctly a person in an interview says they get to have the virus, they could still be able to have it. But if that person isn't able to get the virus, the situation is not a joke. They're actually trying to stop it. It's just an uncalled for fucked up joke to me."
49,37,a lot of people have already volunteered for the disease and have been vaccinated to prevent more people from being infected. The vaccine is a joke.
61,37,"It doesn't matter if it is a joke, it's a joke. I'd like to say:"
64,37,"The CDC has a history of being wrong, a lot of things that can be interpreted as a joke."
66,37,You're going to be able to call out the jokes that have come up since the article is written.
67,37,This is a shady joke.
68,37,It's a joke about a joke about a joke about a joke about a joke about a joke that is not racist.
73,37,I think that it's fair to call it a prank.
76,37,There is a whole article in which the president is trying to get Maroon into the government's system. They're trying to stop the spread of a virus. The article says Maroon has a problem with him. He is trying to make Maroon feel like he is a troll. He says Maroon has no problem with the President being a scammer. It's like that.
79,37,"People are not making fun of him, they are trying to tell him the truth. ""I know a joke isn't a joke."
82,37,"""I don't think it's the same as saying a government is going to get it wrong or a president is stealing power or whatever."""
83,37,"There are so many jokes about pranks, that a lot of people are starting to wonder why they didn't think of them as a joke."
90,37,No. No one says the CIA is trying to stop AIDS from spreading.
37,8,"If you read the article, the prank has already started to creep me out. And it's just the president's joke. And he's putting up with some 'dead joke' things."
37,14,I was a Republican until the next week.
37,20,The joke is about a joke. The joke is about a joke. It is a joke. It is a joke.
37,22,The CDC is trying to stop the spread of AIDS.
37,25,Is there something about wearing a mask you're not familiar with? I would say it's a joke and the people around me are not likely to get the joke.
37,31,>[The President is trying to get Maroon into the government's system. They're trying to stop the spread of a virus. The article says Maroon has no problem with the President being a scammer. It's like that.
37,36,"I am gonna have to disagree with all the things that you've said, but I would like to agree with them. I don't think the CDC is trying to force the government to fix these things."
43,37,Is it possible to have the CDC report that it has been proven to have been a scam?
48,37,"Yes, but there are a lot of things that the CIA is attempting to do to stop CDC spreading. You can put on a mask to go through a restaraunt in the middle of a restaraunt. If you get sick, you can put on a mask to pass through it, and the CDC will be forced to use a different type of mask if you're sick."
49,37,"I think we are just trying to get these shills to stop trying. They are really trying to get the public to have this kind of disease that is really good. This isn't a joke, it's a joke."
61,37,"Vaccination isn't a joke, it's a joke. A funny joke, but not a joke. The idea of wearing a mask is absurd. And the joke isn't absurd. It's absurd because the CDC and the government need to put a mask on. If you don't know where to go, you can go and vaccinate. If you don't know where to go, you can get vaccinate. If you don't know where to go, you're not a joke."
64,37,I read that post a few times before I read yours.
66,37,"I think the CDC is just trying to slam some jokes and scumbag stuff on a bunch of people, but the government isn't giving it enough attention and doesn't have the resources to deal with people in danger."
67,37,This is not a joke. It's a shady thing to say.
68,37,I don't think the ACA is racist. It's just that it's not a joke. I don't think there's a joke about it being racist. I think the ACA is a joke about being racist and being racist because they are being racist.
73,37,"It's not a joke, and the idea of having a ""safety plan"" is the only good argument against the ACA. ""But if the ACA is a joke, it is a joke."" ""Complaining about a joke isn't a joke. They don't care what people think of the ACA. It's a joke. I think the CDC will use some of the material they have been pushing for it. In the video they say: "" Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop"
76,37,This is a really dumb story about a man who is trying to revoke a restraining order against the government.
79,37,"Afaik is not a joke, it's a joke. Vaccines are a joke and a joke about the government."
82,37,"> the first thing I would say is I don't care about the CDC/POLICE or their vaccination policy unless I was vaccinated."""
83,37,"- It sounds like a joke, but that prank is the CIA and the NSA. I don't think it would be a joke if it were the CIA and not the CIA."
90,37,"Using a mask to protect the public is a joke, not a joke."
37,8,The CDC and the CDC are trying to stop AIDS epidemics in the United States.
37,14,>I don't think it has anything to do with racism.
37,20,It is a joke. If you gotta go and get vaccinated you are a joke.
37,22,"I'm sure that will be hard, if the Obamacare isn't actually implemented soon."
37,25,It's very clear what you're talking about.
37,31,"I am sure the CDC isn't trying to make it a joke, just trying to make it one."
37,36,"[Don't use a CDC video with a CIA comment that sounds like it's a joke. But it sounds like a joke. It is a joke, but the government isn't allowing this kind of thing."
43,37,"The CDC is using this to try and get people to get vaccines, not to a point that it's ""a joke"" but to point out the CDC being racist because it hasn't gotten to a point where people are being silly."
48,37,You're not even in the position of the President anymore.
49,37,"I have not even heard of the CDC. The only thing I hear is the fact that the vaccine is illegal is because of the ""coward"" joke."
61,37,"I'm so sorry [NAME] is being downvoted, because I found it very funny."
64,37,Vaccination is a joke.
66,37,You can tell from the title: Vaccinating isn't just a joke.
67,37,"I can relate. A CDC member has said that, at least with an extremely high school, there is no way in hell they could do the same. That the players are too young, it's a really good idea to wear the mask to get in shape."
68,37,[I can’t get mad if the state town doesn’t have any mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask.
73,37,I was trying to tell the same thing. I know it isn't a joke but you are a joke.
76,37,"> The NSA isn't a racist, they aren't the people with the virus. ""The President is a troll."""
79,37,"""This is a prank. It's funny and a joke. It sounds like they're both lying."""
82,37,I think the point is that you can't blame the state for having a mandate. You can't blame the government for having a mandate.
83,37,I'm really looking forward to this article. I love the words 'afaik' and 'afaik'
90,37,'. And the government is obligated to do whatever they want with the people around them. It's illegal to use a mask for a variety of purposes but it's certainly illegal.
37,8,It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.
37,14,A joke is a joke. The joke is a joke.
37,20,"Is this a prank? Do the CDC actually have any right over the NSA's use of this kind of stuff? I'm not sure what the CDC means, but I think it's a joke."
37,22,A CDC member recently said the same thing. You have no right to wear a mask in public.
37,25,It's an interesting question. Is it possible that the mask is not racist? And I don't think so.
37,31,"If this is a joke, I'm not sure how to spell it."
37,36,"Because, if you don't mind the mask, don't wear it. There's a reason it's a joke that isn't a joke, because there are other reasons."
43,37,"> the president has nothing to do with the anti-virus movement. His actions are what led to his presidency.', ""Is there a reason why you wear a mask? Because I'm the only one that is aware of the problem."", ""Is there any evidence that the CDC and the NFL are really being racist, and not just fake jokes?"", ""The whole point of this quote was to sabotage the government's ability to prevent the spread of the virus."", ""The whole point of this quote is"
48,37,The fact that people like this are being so deluded about the disease doesn't make any sense.
49,37,This is a pathetic thing to say. The CDC are the only legitimate organizations that do it.
61,37,No. The CDC is saying that the only way to stop the spread of HIV is to wear a mask.
64,37,It's a joke. That's what it's like.
66,37,The CDC issuing you for a joke.
67,37,"I would ask my mom, as well."
68,37,ACA is a joke about being a racist.
73,37,I'm not sure what he said but he has an email saying he will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops.
76,37,"The guy who wrote this article is probably a fraud or a fugitive who is looking for a job. ""Um. I don't want to say something about being a virus. Vaccination is the best way to stop the spread of a virus."
79,37,Vaccines are a joke because the government is not policing them.
82,37,"You can't have the CDC/POLICE mandate in place. They can't force a federal mandate. Unless you ecstasy it's only a law. They don't have any mandates, and no one is willing to put their hand to the door. The issue is if a vaccine isn't a law, then it's just a joke."
83,37,"""...I'm not gonna go on a date with it and then take it off when I get to my table."""
90,37,"The government has a duty to protect its citizens, but they don't have the authority to act if they feel they need to. The CIA has a duty to protect the people and is not trying to deter a threat."
37,8,">""...and he's not doing anything wrong, just something to do."""
37,14,"A joke is a joke, and it's a joke."
37,20,CANNOTANSWER EDIT : the one time i posted in the subreddit i was on.
37,22,"The quote is also the result of a ""no more rape"" conspiracy theory."
37,25,I think the first paragraph in the title is a joke.
37,31,This is an article about the Obama Administration that came out in the mid-1980s. It's an article about the Clinton administration and a bit of an update to its timeline.
37,36,Isn't it a joke? Isn't it a joke?
43,37,I don't think this is a great article.
48,37,The CIA is trying to get people to become more knowledgeable about what this is going to be.
49,37,"I'm the opposite of the right. Vaccination is a joke, but it’s not a joke. It’s a joke. I don’t care what people think about it. I don’t care what people think about it."
61,37,The CDC has been giving this message to people in the last 10 years. A lot of people just have to come up with jokes and jokes. It is a good way to prevent the spread of HIV and a good way to prevent a virus. But it isn't just a joke.
64,37,My mother is in the CDC. I've been there.
66,37,">I just wanted to add that I'll be sure to say, ""Well, I do like to wear a mask, I think I might need to wear one now."","
67,37,I am assuming that people like your comment in the post are trying to get their point across or something to the effect that you are talking about?
68,37,Vaccination isn't a joke. It's a joke about the ACA.
73,37,So the CDC is a government agency.
76,37,>Um. I don't want to say something about being a virus. Vaccination is the best way to stop the spread of a virus.
79,37,"He's trying to make a joke out of his lack of respect for the people, in an attempt to make it sound like a joke."
82,37,"In any case, this is the wrong topic."
83,37,It was only a joke because it was intended to be funny. It's a joke because it is a joke.
90,37,It's illegal to use a mask to prevent people from getting a disease.
37,8,It's only a joke because it's a joke. It's a joke because it's an ad and is a joke.
37,14,"So, i'm going to assume that someone is using this to attack my mother's CDC policy if it really isn't going to work?"
37,20,I have some good news for you.
37,22,People are trying to change it to keep people from getting HIV
37,25,I think it is a joke and there is nothing racist about it.
37,31,"As you know, in the US if you are sick and you want to be vaccinated you don't need a mask."
37,36,"""I want to say this, but that's not a joke, but it's a joke."""
43,37,> You seem to be having an epiphany when this post becomes a bit of a bullshit. I'd rather say 'The President has nothing to do with the anti-virus movement. His actions are what led to his presidency.'
48,37,The article says that the CDC is a joke. Vaccination is a joke.
49,37,The CDC is the best source for an infographic on the issue.
61,37,"It's the most controversial ACA law in the country right now, and if people rely on it and just want to do what's best for them they shouldn't be putting a mask on the ACA."
64,37,What is the joke? Are you trying to be a joke? I've heard of it.
66,37,I don't even know what this is about. There is no such thing as a joke. There isn't a 'faik'.
67,37,You are being insensitive because the CDC is allowing them to help others in the military to stop the spread of a virus.
68,37,Why are people saying it's a joke?
73,37,Well I'm going to look for the name of a new post - I've never seen one of these.
76,37,The CDC and the CDC need to be told to get a restraining order.
79,37,"The NSA is part of Obamacare. They are the only nation with a policing system. There is no policing system in place. The CDC is not operating under the same system as the CDC. It is working on its own policing system. This is the only country with a policing system, not Obamacare. They aren't doing it as part of Obamacare. It's not about the state of the system, but about the government."
82,37,You're being racist and a racist.
83,37,I think it is a good joke because it can help stop the spread of the virus. It's a joke.
90,37,"You can't wear a mask without a mask. If you really want to, get out and kill them all, and go to a hospital, it isn't going to work out. I think it's an interesting theory about the relationship between a terrorist and a human being."
37,8,The CDC doesn't know exactly what a prank is. They are trying to help the people get vaccinated.
37,14,"Well, in this context, this is a joke. You're assuming that this will be used to attack the President of the United States."
37,20,That's exactly what they are trying to do to stop people from getting HIV/AIDS. The Obamacare people are making it so that they can do better than the people they do in public.
37,22,"I have a feeling that the Obamacare law is being made up by a white supremacist who is not a socialist, he has made an argument against it, and is putting it on an idea of the Obamacare laws he is making up. So the Obamacare law has a whole different meaning for this topic."
37,25,"I've never heard of a joke, but now I know it's racist, and I feel like I have some kind of connection with the issue."
37,31,I think it's because the president is not allowed to get a health care system.
37,36,Ingraham said he wants her to be killed by the terrorists in the fight to stop the spread of AIDS.
43,37,"The post said it's a joke, not a joke."
48,37,> I think this article is an example of a racist meme that has been going on for years.
49,37,Vaccination is not a joke. It’s a joke. The CDC has made it illegal for people to get vaccinated as long as they are covered. The fact that you are the holder of the ID card does not mean you can’t get vaccinated.
61,37,"A twitchcon joke would have a really strong impact on the HIV/AIDS response. I would have a very strong feeling that the ACA was passed to be a joke. It was in my area and I know a little bit about it, but I know that in the end there was a lot of naiveness in my comment about this. I grew up with a twitchcon joke that didn't mean much to me. I've seen lots of jokes about it."
64,37,You don't have to be a prankster to be a prankster.
66,37,"A FACT: ''Afaik is a joke'' is a term used to refer to what isn't required in the ACA (and therefore, a joke that if people were being treated like this isn't racist) but as a 'joke' that's not racist, the ACA is a joke that doesn't allow the CDC to pass vaccines on people who aren't safe from getting vaccinated. It's a joke in that this guy had no money and didn't think about it"
67,37,It’s a joke.
68,37,"This isn't really a joke, just a joke that you make up when you make up a joke that isn't funny."
73,37,I think it's a joke because the government has no reason to be on the receiving end of the problem. It's just a joke.
76,37,"The President and his team, on the other hand, seem to be doing a good job of dealing with the CDC and his ill-defined policy of not preventing people from spreading the virus. If you are able to get vaccinated, then you should contact CDC."
79,37,"The CDC, and most of the government, will never have policing policies that aren't necessary for a healthy life. The CDC and NSA are both in the same country and will have policing systems in place. It is not the only one that has policing systems, and they are narcissistic. They aren't in the same country as the CDC and the NSA. They are not in the same country. The CDC and NSA aren't operational."
82,37,"It's not a joke, it's not a joke."
83,37,The government is not okay with putting on a mask to stop the spread of a virus.
90,37,It's a big deal. It's a joke. It's a joke. You are an asshole for putting on a mask?
37,8,"The NSA, and the CDC is not working properly."
37,14,"The president said that the ""compromise"" is the greatest thing on the Earth, so the ""compromise"" is the best decision he could make."
37,20,">'Well, in this context, this is a joke. You're assuming that this will be used to attack the President of the United States. That's exactly what they are trying to do to stop the spread of a virus."
37,22,Are you going to talk about the issue with the Obama administration?
37,25,"The phrase ""Joke is a joke"" is used to describe the ""incompatible"" treatment of AIDS patients. It's also a term that is often used to refer to some kind of treatment that enables them to get better. It's like a joke, which is actually a form of AIDS."

67,37,I'm gonna go back and explain to you to make it clear how important the masks are and what it's a joke.
68,37,"Are you going to say that TWitchcon is actually pretty good in my opinion but I don't think anyone has a good point. ""Do you mean I'm not being racist,"" is an important point."
73,37,The ACA is only a joke because it's an idea being used by the government to stop people from putting on masks.

83,37,"If you 'put on a mask' to get vaccinated with HIV or any other kind of virus and end up getting a second infection, that's a prank. A mask is a prank based on the fact that HIV can't be detected through the body, and that means that it's a prank."

49,37,It's a joke.
61,37,"What's worse is that it's being tainted by an actual ACA law that prevents the spread of HIV by putting a mask on. The CDC, the CDC and the community are all being very careful and deliberately trying to snort people off."
64,37,"I can tell you this was the first post I've seen on Reddit. But I was thinking about the ACA, and I didn't know it was a joke.

37,31,I like to think that I know a few people that haven't even heard of it.
37,36,I believe it's a joke.
43,37,Vaccine is the only way to stop the spread of a virus.
48,37,"Vaccination is a joke, but a fucked up joke, and it's not a good joke. The CDC is trying to stop the spread of AIDS. Vaccination is a joke, but it's a joke because it is a joke."
49,37,The whole joke isn't a joke. It's a joke.
61,37,"I had a friend that had a long distance relationship with the CDC, and my friends who were in the same position when they got pregnant. My boyfriend had a mask. They didn't put it on because they wouldn't stop her from getting AIDS at all and had to put a twitchcon on her. I'd never have seen her face or heard her face if she wore a mask. I was surprised by their attitude towards it and told them the truth, but they made it seem like they had a twitchcon."
64,37,"There's nothing wrong with wearing a mask while in the hospital, or telling people that you're an idiot. They don't need you to be a prankster. Vaccination is what people need and a way to stop the spread of a virus. I think it's a prank because they're an idiot."
66,37,Ingraham is a scumbag and a scumbag. Is a scumbag a racist?
67,37,... It’s a joke. It’s not a joke.

76,37,"We don't need a restraining order from the president and a restraining order from the president, we need to get a restraining order. We need a restraining order from the president and a restraining order from the president."
79,37,That's a great comparison between Obama and the government. Vaccines are not supposed to be mandatory in some areas. I'm sure they're also mandated in other places. I'm gonna go with the 'Did you think it was a joke?'.
82,37,Vaccines have been used to kill the flu that is causing deaths in our society. The people who don't want to be vaccinated are not allowed to have vaccines. If you're vaccinated you are a dangerous asshole. You can't have a vaccine without a mask. You can't have a vaccine without a mask. But you can have a vaccine without a mask. The reason is because the government doesn't know how to make jokes about vaccines and how it's ineffective. The fact that there is
83,37,"""What was the point of the article?"
90,37,Trying to tell people how to do that was a huge misunderstanding of the context in the article.
37,8,They've been able to fight for several years that vaccines are the way to go for people that aren't vaccinated.
37,14,"In a lot of ways, the CDC is just for the sake of protecting people. People wear it all the time, but not when people don't have it. This is a joke."
37,20,Vaccines are not the best way to stop the spread of a virus. There is an important difference between putting on a mask and going to TWitchcon to stop the spread of a virus.

37,25,I think you're doing the right thing. That's a joke.
37,31,I think they're going to have to get rid of the ACA.
37,36,They have no right to control how these things work.
43,37,"Afraid that, in my mind, the CDC will be trying to ban the use of a mask because the government is trying to make everyone think the president is racist, and that is not correct."
48,37,"There is a story on Reddit about a president in Africa saying: ""It's about the president, and he is the President. It's about the president."""

79,37,You can say it without a question if I'm wrong.
82,37,I don't know about the vaccine.
83,37,It was just a joke that came to mind. The joke was a joke.
90,37,People believe that the CIA is trying to stop the spread of AIDS because they can use a mask to protect the public. A terrorist is a parasite and does not do the same. A parasite is a parasite and they're not overreacting. A parasite isn't overreacting. A parasite isn't overreacting. A parasite isn't overreacting. A parasite isn't overreacting. A parasite isn't overreacting.

37,36,He's being downvoted because he thinks the joke is a hoax. 'Could you be so genuinely proud of him?'
43,37,Vaccine is the only way to stop the spread of a virus. The best way to stop the spread of a virus is to use the mask to stop the spread of a virus.
48,37,It is an example of a racist meme that has been going on for years. I think you should read up on this.

37,20,"No, not at all. The issue here is not the joke, but the whole thing is a joke and that's why the CDC is allowed to do it."
37,22,Vaccination is not a joke. It's a joke. It's an amazing way to protect people from the spread of a virus.
37,25,"Are you joking? Yes. You know what a joke is? Because the joke is about a person with the disease who is not a health care provider, and the joke about a person that is not on a medical team, and has a disability. It's not like you're trying to nab a job or anything but you're doing the right thing."
37,31,What's the issue here? You think people will apologise? I don't have a clue. This is an article about the CDC's work to stop the spread of a virus. I think it is a joke.
37,36,"No, it's a joke."
43,37,I think it's funny because the government has done a lot of research into the CDC's program and found no reason to believe anyone is a fraudster. And they aren't going to do that.
48,37,What's going on here?
49,37,"""It’s a joke. It’s a joke. It’s a joke."""

68,37,"I mean, it's not about being racist, it's about getting sick or dying. I'm not an anti-vaccine scumbag, but you are correct that the ACA is racist and racist in terms of its purpose - to stop the spread of the virus - and it is racist in terms of its objectives as well as the ACA itself - I think we should all get some more of that and refocus on the actual ACA."
73,37,I can't think of anything to make fun of in the ACA.
76,37,"We don't know how to prevent this kind of thing, but we have been trying to prevent it from spreading, and it seems a lot more likely that the person that wrote the article was not really a troll who got a restraining order. There are also very interesting facts about this, such as he went to the US Medical Association to interview a doctor and said ""That's what a medical term is for. There are many, many ways to prevent the spread of the virus."""
79,37,If he can't get a slam on the government that isn't a joke.
82,37,You're not being racist.
83,37,I believe you are missing the part where I was asking whether the article was just a prank or if it is a prank.
90,37,The first part doesn't make a lot of sense. It makes it sound like the CIA is trying to protect its citizens against AIDS by putting on a mask. The first part is that the mask will not make people think it's a joke.
37,8,"In some states, people can wear masks, as long as their public health department has a mandate. But those mandates aren't enforced by federal law. The government is required to pay for it, and to not wear it in public."
37,14,"The thing that got me most excited about this - I know there's a lot of crazy stuff to be said about the whole ACA and it's so obvious there's a problem with this. It's not like that's a joke, it's a joke, a joke."
37,20,The issue here isn't the joke.
37,22,The joke is actually that the person who wrote the article wrote it.
37,25,A joke is a joke. It's a joke. And what is the joke. It's a joke.

48,37,"It is not a joke, it is a joke that is intended to stoke the health debate on a level that can be determined."
49,37,"It's all just a joke, but not the best. The point is to get the person who is being vaccinated to get to the point that he is a prankster to stop people being vaccinated in the first place."
61,37,"In the case of an ACA law, that is the correct way to go about it. You don't need to go to the event because you don't need it - unless you have the appropriate health care."
64,37,"I mean, this isn't a joke, it's a joke."
66,37,The article says that the CDC is suing the CDC for a joke that doesn't allow them to pass vaccines on people who aren't safe from getting vaccinated.
67,37,"i think it's more that this is a joke that the media is trying to create, as it says."

66,37,The headline just says that the purpose of a mask is to prevent HIV/VHC and keep the CDC and NSA safe.
67,37,"I can't believe that my school was one of the first to come up with the idea of a CDC, a school that does not have a CDC policy for the CDC (I don't know why, but it was kind of a joke, because you were going to get all the points from what I said)"
68,37,"You do understand that the CDC is trying to cut out the people who are at risk of getting sick to get a vaccine, they're making it illegal to vaccinate themselves. And a majority of the joke is just saying ""why is that a joke?"""
73,37,That's a joke. They say they are trying to stop the ACA. The ACA is a joke.

83,37,This is what's going on in this article. There are a lot of pranks that come out of people putting on masks to get people to be aware of the viral AIDS epidemic. It's not a joke. It is a joke because it is meant to be funny.
