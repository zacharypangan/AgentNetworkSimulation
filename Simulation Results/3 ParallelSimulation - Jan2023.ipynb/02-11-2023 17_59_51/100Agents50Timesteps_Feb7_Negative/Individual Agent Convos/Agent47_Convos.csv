47,31,Is there some form of government mandate for vaccination that s a bad idea? I was in a doctor's office for an emergency. He told me if I had a sick child he was supposed to have boosters he was allowed to wear a mask. It was a horrible idea for the doctor to force them into the hospital.
50,47,"I'm a politician, and a bit of a nerd, but my favorite is putting on a mask and then going in to a doctor and then going in and doing something else for the sake of the medical community."

54,47,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam.
58,47,I like the idea of that.
61,47,I'm going to tell you this: The US has mandates on who must wear a mask if they are vaccinated / vaccinated.

47,25,"This seems very logical and logical, not just a rhetorical one. It seems like people are not committing the stupidest thing on earth."
47,27,"It's really funny that a lot of people are saying this to be false, but I mean, if you're not a vaccinated person, you could just get away with it, too. But it would be rude if the state didn't get mandates to allow people to get vaccinated because of a lack of vaccines."
47,31,Why are you so hateful about wearing a mask in the first place? Because you have to be vaccinated.
50,47,"I have no idea what the exact number is of people who are using it, but I'm going to guess that a lot of people use it."
53,47,This is not a joke. Its a joke. Its a joke.
54,47,This is all a scam to me because this is a way for politicians to justify what they are doing if they don't want to.
58,47,You could still wear a mask for about 7 years. Is there any point in going to an NIH clinic to ask for this to end? If you would like to know the best way to do it.
61,47,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.

I'm not trying to be an asshole but I am the one who wears a mask every day. If you've never had a vaccinated child in your life, you're doing something so incredibly immature and utterly idiotic. I like the idea of that. This is not a joke. It seems like people"

47,27,"There's a lot of shit on here about the government being able to mandate a lot of things in a specific way, if anything it isn't going to work if the people who are going to be doing things aren't able to go to a doctor's office."
47,31,You have to get vaccinated.
50,47,I think you're right. I was trying to point out the stupidity of how well it's being deployed by the government and why there's not anything I can do about it.
53,47,"If this were me I'd probably end up on the streets like that, and it would be a shitshow. You know this isn't how the virus is spread. Its a virus that could affect people of any age, who is able to survive or die. You could still survive and still be a shitshow as well. The joke may not have any actual practical benefit but it would definitely be a lot less harmful than other things like vaccines."
54,47,What if you wear a mask? What if you aren't?
58,47,"...but I don't think that the people of this world are going to care about her... unless you're playing football in a club with no sassy coach on the other hand, then putting on a mask is an incredibly dangerous and unnecessary tactic, as you'd be surprised if people would get away with it."
61,47,[NAME] on the other hand was in my family a shaver and got vaccinated with the virus.
93,47,What you're saying is that the government has a right to keep the public safe.
47,9,"This is just an excuse for a ridiculous ""shame"" I was being facetious about and trying to say something obnoxious, if not actually valid, but I guess it's a legitimate excuse."
47,24,You're making a lot of silly arguments that you would get away with if you were at a football game with a shaver.
47,25,It doesn't matter if you are vaccinated or not. It is a virus.
47,27,Vaccination is not the only medical benefit. If the government is mandated then they will not give any other benefits.
47,31,I don't believe they would have that issue with it if it wasn't for a mandate.
50,47,Its not a joke. Its a problem. A big issue. The problem is that the truth has to be told.
53,47,I think I'm on the fence about that.
54,47,"I hate when a joke is a joke, and if it's true, I'm going to go talk to a CDC."
58,47,"If they are gonna make the president and Congress do this... I think it's probably too late. If you are going to get a restraining order based on their comments about it, the NSA can't even take it seriously."

93,47,"I'm not joking about this. i'm just saying that they would be stupid to not consider this as a real thing, but they aren't."
47,9,Vaccination is not a law.
47,24,"If you are not being facetious, then you have no legitimate reason to make the case for a restraining order and don't even consider the facts."

53,47,"They do not want you to wear a mask to work so they are being a fraud, a criminal."
54,47,I'm not a political or professional. But I do believe that the CDC is responsible for the vaccination program. The CDC is not.

53,47,"I believe the CDC has actually decided not to put on a mask because they're not concerned about people's health and they think they are being a fraud, a criminal."
54,47,I've never heard this phrase but I was a little shocked to read the title. The CDC is essentially trying to keep the health care industry functioning.
58,47,"'Hey, you don't have to wear a mask to stay at home unless you're really sick, 'because I do not want you to be in a position to take your kids to the doctor'"

53,47,"So I'm going to tell you this is one of the most dangerous things that I've ever heard about the government - because I don't like being in a mask, and in a situation like this I always assume I'm just not a fucking joker."
54,47,"You're a snob, I am. You think this is a scam?"
58,47,Vaccination is a good way to prevent the spread of the virus.

47,27,"I've heard this. They are very good at masking what they want if they see someone in the air. Vaccination is a great way to prevent spread of the virus, but it also has a very limited chance of getting a new person in the US."
47,31,Honestly he said the worst thing about this he did in his life... he was a joke.
50,47,It's called a mask of a mask.
53,47,The government is in a very dangerous position. They've been there before and the government has always been there and irrationally so to speak. But I don't know if you agree with them. You're talking about people who have never been there before.

58,47,"You can't wear a mask on your dick, you have to put on a mask."
61,47,"You need to get the police to put a mask on at the events. That's why you have to wear a mask. If you aren't vaccinated, you have to have a mask, you can wear it, you don't have to wear it, or you can't wear a mask, you aren't getting a virus. This isn't a joke."
93,47,The Obama administration is making a mess out of that. It's not about the US. It's about this conspiracy theory.
47,9,"It was only a joke, but the CDC is blatantly manipulating people 'because that would be the only logical way to get sick.'"

47,31,I was at a concert where I was in a vaccinated state. My family got sick and they were forced to wear a mask. It was a horrible idea because they wanted to keep the sick person safe and didn't want to. My dad's a horrible joker.
50,47,This is a joke. It's not a joke.
53,47,"""The whole ""right to keep locked inside"" movement is a shit job. ""...the world is an utterly fucked up place and it's very difficult to keep our heads together on the subject."" So, why would a politician think they are being racist? The reason a prank is a joke is that the government has banned it and allowing the virus to spread is the only way to prevent it. I lost my job and I lost my mask."
54,47,"In my opinion, the government is still the best place to start in order to avoid spread of HIV. The CDC is still the best place to start."
58,47,The real question is what should the president wear? That the person has the right to be protected?
61,47,So you know how people get sick with a narwhal mask?
93,47,I think it's about the US. It's about this conspiracy theory.
47,9,This is a really good way to express your opinion and my own personal experience in the US.
47,24,This isn't a joke. It's not a joke.
47,25,"Apparently, there are ways of preventing the spread of the virus. It is called a mask of a mask, but it's a bit of a stretch to think this might be the reason behind it, but it makes me think about the facts instead of the facts."

93,47,"It is a conspiracy theory that the US has been able to use the NSA to prevent sex in order to impose its own regulations. So what we're going to do is ask the CIA to stop sex, and the CIA will allow it."

So what we're going to do is ask the CIA to stop sex, and they will allow it."
47,27,"I really think if you had any idea what a mask of a mask was, that would explain why we haven't been able to stop it from spreading, but that the government is in the process of being mandated to allow a vaccine to be provided."

A person who doesn't get the vaccine is a liar. That's a lie. I see a lot of people who would just be pointing it out as a joke. Is it only because of an imposter that didn't read this post?"
58,47,That's not a joke. The CDC is using an ad to spread the virus.

47,31,You're being naive. You're being naive. And you're not giving the president any of the answers in the way he's trying to tell us.
50,47,I had a friend that was doing the 'Fake Vaccination' program. And the guy was talking about being a doctor who would use the fake Vaccination for people to get HIV/AIDS. He was pointing out how shady and silly it was. He thought the CDC was being run by an imposter. I thought he was an idiot. He told them a secret they were going to use to protect people. He called the CDC. I had no idea the CDC had a medical device. They said they were going to ban them but 
53,47,"The CDC has been there before, and in many states there are very few restrictions on it. You can wear a mask and get a vaccine if you are willing. You can wear a mask and get a vaccine if you are willing."
54,47,I think the most effective way to stop a virus outbreak is to protect yourself and everyone else. That is how the government is doing it. But that doesn't mean they're the CDC.
58,47,"No, they aren't. 'Vaccination is the only thing that is shady, or any more controversial, in this country.'"
61,47,It's a joke because the government thinks it's a joke and people think it's a joke because it's a joke.
93,47,"It's one of the big things about the government. This isn't some ""the secret service"" thing you can pretend we haven't seen any evidence of but we could have sex with a random person. The ""secret police"" thing we saw was that the government would be using the NSA to prevent rape. There was no other way to prevent rape in the NSA. So we've got a bunch of narcissists trying to keep them out of the country."
47,9,"So, if a guy can nab the CDC's hivemind to the CDC, and the CDC doesn't want to use it, why are the people using it?"
47,24,Vaccination is a good way to prevent the spread of the virus.
47,25,That's a really strange idea.
47,27,The CDC is attempting to prevent a virus that isn't even in vaccine form.

He said he knew the CDC would be looking for people to avoid getting sick, but didn't want them vaccinated. He was trying to avoid him putting him in the military because he was sick and wanted to prevent his own health. He said he was a doctor and wanted to stop people from being sick, so he had to get sick from a few days after"
53,47,"If you don't like the government, then you're a prick and I'd rather not be a joker."

58,47,"We've got to stop our governments from taking on the responsibility for the spread of the virus. It's not funny, but it's still not a joke."
61,47,I don't really see how that will actually get rid of anything. It's just a joke.

47,27,"Why would you want to have a CDC ad? Because if you don't want to get a vaccine, you can get them a mask for your vaccine. And you can't get anyone a vaccine for HIV. There's a difference between vaccines and AIDS. The only reason it can be a joke is because it prevents the spread of the disease."
47,31,>You can't get mad that an event doesn't have any mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask.
50,47,"This is very clear. There is a significant part of the joke, not the actual purpose of the joke. The CDC is not responsible for the spread of the virus. The problem isn't the mask itself, it's the disease itself."
53,47,The only way to stop it is to get a vaccine.
54,47,The CDC doesn't like a CDC-approved vaccine.
58,47,I’m actually not aware of any of this... The guy is making it seem like he’s bringing a lot of people into the discussion. 'His hat is on the face of the government.’’
61,47,I think you're being a little harsh.
93,47,"""I think it's a big deal, because I don't think it's really a big deal. The CIA has been able to use the NSA to prevent sex in order to impose its own regulations. So what we're going to do is ask the CIA to stop sex, and the CIA will allow it."""
47,9,"So, the CDC can decide which things need to be put on the list and when the ones that are not are narcissistic. This isn't a conspiracy theory. This is an opinion that needs to be heard in a reasonable and respectful manner. And that is what you are being sarcastic about."
47,24,"In all seriousness, I am not a very active citizen, so this is a prank. I am not a racist, and I am not against any restraining order, even though the one I am against is a falsehood. I am not a racist."
47,25,"Because the problem isn't the mask itself, it's the disease itself. The only way to stop the spread is to get a vaccine. The CDC is attempting to stop a virus spread by denying that the government is able to prevent sex."
47,27,"The CDC is not responsible for the spread of the virus. The problem isn't the mask itself, it's the disease itself. The only way to stop it is to get a vaccine."
47,31,"I'm sorry if this makes you so upset, but I have a few thoughts about the president."
50,47,"The CDC is trying to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS. Vaccination is a good way to stop HIV/AIDS. You have to wear a mask and get vaccinated. Vaccination is the only thing that a person has to go through. They don't necessarily prevent the spread of the virus. There is a point where they don't say the same things for that, and what they're saying about it is ""this is a joke"" or ""This is a joke"", but that's a big joke."
53,47,Is this a joke? It is one of the most dangerous things that I have ever heard about the government.
54,47,"It's pretty clear the government's intentions are the same, but they are different."
58,47,That's a very nice phrase. It's funny that you're still laughing at it.
61,47,So you can't twitch.
93,47,"They don't have the authority to change the rules, and they do not have the authority to make those laws. It's very likely that the NSA will be used to change the rules. I don't think there's enough evidence to know whether it's not something that is a conspiracy. I believe it's a fact, and the CIA is a piece of the conspiracy."
47,9,"This is a big deal - I'm a member of the House of Representatives. But I am still not a fan of this man, he is just an asshole, and is not the kind of person who would listen to the CDC."
47,24,This is a prank. This is a prank. This is a prank.
47,25,The issue I'm concerned about is how the government can help stop sex if they want. They can do that in order to prevent sex if they want and if it doesn't.
47,27,You're a prick.
47,31,"If it's a joke and the president didn't do a damn thing about it, I think you're being a little harsh."
50,47,"Isn't it the government's job to ban the CDC, not the country's?"
53,47,I want to make fun of everyone who calls this a prank. I don't care if it's a joke. I don't care about a joke. The CDC and all of the other agencies haven't said anything shady about it yet. The CDC's'shit job' isn't a joke. It's a prank.
54,47,"The guy is talking about what a twitchcon is about, and not the actual vaccine."
58,47,"You're saying that it is a joke, but you're being completely overreacting. The Obama administration is not really responsible for preventing spread of the virus."
61,47,if you're not wearing a mask then you are not vaccinated
93,47,i think you need to call this a troll
47,9,The CDC is doing a very poor job of communicating and educating the public.

47,31,This is a prank. People are making fun of it.
50,47,"The CDC doesn't have a right to ban them, it just wants to ban them."
53,47,"And it's a joke, right? You've done nothing wrong. It's like trying to talk about something and you're making fun of everyone else."
54,47,"If you have to talk to the CDC about it, tell them they are trying to make the government a better place to do it."
58,47,I like the idea of that.
61,47,The fact that this sub is making you look like you're not a racist idiot doesn't change that fact: Vaccination is an important part of the health system.
93,47,The NSA has an entire system in place for the purpose of stopping the spread of virus in countries. What does that do to them?
47,9,Vaccination isn't a law.
47,24,"I'm a little surprised the CDC doesn't have a mandate, but the CDC is an idiot. The mask is part of the measure, but not a job. It's part of the government's job to stop the spread of the virus."
47,25,">I don't think you need to call this a joke. Isn't it the government's job to ban the CDC, not the country's?"
47,27,Vaccination is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
47,31,So you are saying the president is not responsible for stopping AIDS because he is not vaccinated?
50,47,A government shutdown is the next step in preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS.
53,47,"I don't think this is a joke. You're talking about a person who wears a mask to work because of their age, and a joke about a person who gets sick from vaccines, or just isn't ready to deal with the fact that they don't want to be in that position."
54,47,Heh... what was a joke?

47,25,The CDC is trying to stop the spread of AIDS.
47,27,The only one I can think of that is not racist is the CDC. I can think of the reason it would be wrong to put a mask on people who don't get a vaccine.

58,47,"As a physician, I feel the need to remind you that the CDC should be working to get the vaccine wiped out. This would help me more when I was diagnosed with HIV, as the CDC will use the vaccine to clone people so that they are more likely to receive the vaccine.

The only reason they are able to spread a virus is because they are making it more likely to get a restraining order"

47,9,"The thing is, the CDC is trying to stop AIDS from spreading. Vaccination isn't a joke. It's a joke because it's not a joke."
47,24,That's the point. I like the idea of that.
47,25,You aren't good enough for this.
47,27,[How do you know this is a joke about a joke?](http://www.facebook.com/r/raisedbytrump)
47,31,"What a joke. It's not just a joke, it's an example of the country we're living in and that it isn't going to stop you from getting a virus."
50,47,"""The mask is the only cure to the virus."""
53,47,You are a prick.
54,47,People who are really interested in the word'shit' can't get a good laugh from it.
58,47,They said the CDC should have a more detailed list of things they can do to prevent the spread of the virus.
61,47,So I'm just trying to think of something I'm not really familiar with.
93,47,"This is an interesting discussion. If you think it's a conspiracy theory, then you are making a terrible mistake."
47,9,"The CDC and the CIA are using a hivemind to avent the spread of HIV and AIDS. They're using the hivemind to spread the AIDS, because the people that aren't interested in it are not going to be interested in it and the CDC is going to have to make the deal work."
47,24,It's not a joke. It's a joke. It's not a joke. It's a joke.
47,25,"This is an interesting discussion. If you think it's a conspiracy theory, then you are making a terrible mistake."
47,27,"""I hate people with a lot of shit on here. But I mean, if you're not a vaccinated person, you could just get away with it, too. But it would be rude if the state didn't get mandates to allow people to get vaccinated because of a lack of vaccines."", ""I mean, if you're not a vaccinated person, you could just get away with it, too. But it would be rude if the government isn't vaccinated for the vaccine."","
47,31,"""Poor's Day's Eve is not the time to do this."""
50,47,The point of the joke is that this is a joke.
53,47,A joke is a joke if you don't like the joke - you should probably not take it as a prank - but rather the joke is just a joke.
54,47,Is it possible the CDC is trying to help prevent any further outbreaks?
58,47,"The devil wears a mask - it's not funny, it's not a joke - it's a joke."
61,47,I know a joke. I hate being ignorant to the point where it's a joke that the government isn't going to troll because the CDC is a racist entity.
93,47,What is the difference between a white woman attempting to be raped and a black woman trying to be raped by a white man?
47,9,They're trying to stop HIV spread. They're using the hivemind to stop AIDS spread.
47,24,"It's not a joke, it's a joke."
47,25,"This is an interesting conversation. If you think it's a conspiracy theory, then you are making a terrible mistake."
47,27,The question is whether the Obama administration really believes that vaccines are a fucking joke. Or how the Obama administration believes that vaccines are a joke to show people that the health care system is working.
47,31,Vaccination is the best thing that ever happened to America.
50,47,"There are many people in the United States with AIDS, with just a mask, which the CDC will try to get rid of."
53,47,"The whole CDC is trying to slander the government, and the CDC has shit job."
54,47,"I read your name when I was younger and didn't know any better. That is a joke that isn't even actually true at all, but I stayed away from the CDC because of the CDC."
58,47,"Yes, a joke is a joke if the president can't make a legitimate claim for the benefit of others, but the fact is that people tend to think that Obama is a joke is a joke."
61,47,"The joke is a joke, a joke because of a joke, but there is no joke."
93,47,"If you are making a false statement to the contrary, then you will be very much aware of the fact that the CIA is the government."
47,9,Are the hiveminds being used by government? They are all doing it for the reason that the CDC does not allow people in the country to have access to hiveminds.
47,24,"There is a lot of sarcastic stuff at the end of the article about the Obama administration. It is a prank because it is a joke, and a joke isn't a joke because he is trying to spread a shitjob. It's a joke because there is no sarcasm."
47,25,"I thought this article had been very interesting, so I'm going to check it out. It sounds like you're going to be more apt to find the CDC's mask of a mask and not be surprised that they're attempting to cut off the spread of AIDS."
47,27,The point of the joke is that the CDC is trying to prevent HIV and AIDS. The government is trying to help it spread. Is it possible the CDC is trying to slander the CDC?
47,31,"> ""The president has done their best to control the CDC. It's an example of how the US government has made mistakes."""
50,47,"The only thing I know that is not funny is that it doesn't include any kind of ""protecting people"" or a warning of AIDS."
53,47,"The problem with those comments is that they are trying to do a “good thing” that would be a joke and then being forced to stop it by censoring the spread of AIDS. Vaccination is the only thing that is really shady, or any more controversial, in this country. And for a reason, the US is also the only country where anyone can take a vaccine and be a doctor."
54,47,>(http://www.ncc.org/index.php?t=2383-2379-000-e-t&h=5kh) is the CDC's position in this issue.
58,47,The Obama administration is a joke.
61,47,Vaccination is important and it is a joke. It's not a joke because of the joke. There's no joke about it. Vaccination is a joke because it's what it is. It's a joke because of how it's the government.
93,47,"""I am not the only CIA official who is not authorized to take down black people"""
47,9,"The issue isn't what the CDC is trying to solve, it's what the CDC wants and the President is trying to make it work. That's not how we're supposed to be able to solve it in our lifetime."
47,24,"This is a prank because it is a joke. I am not a racist and I am not against a restraining order. I am not against anything, which would include me being a racist."
47,25,"There's a big difference between a joke, and a satire, and one that's a joke."
47,27,"I'm going to tell you, I'm a man and I'm a man. I'm just going to say something."
47,31,"""I can't think of any other way to put on a mask, but a mask makes me sick"""
50,47,AIDS vaccines are good. The people getting AIDS will only be able to get one shot at it in a week or two. This is a joke.
53,47,"""...you can wear a mask and get a vaccine if you are willing."""
54,47,It's a joke – a real joke – but it's not a real one.
58,47,Vaccination is an attempt to prevent the spread of a virus. Vaccination is an attempt to prevent the spread of a virus.
61,47,Vaccination is an important part of the health system. It's a joke because it's what it is. It's a joke because it's what it is. Vaccination is an important part of the health system.
93,47,a conspiracy? or something like that?
47,9,Vaccination is an important part of the health system. It's a joke because it's what it is.
47,24,"It is a joke. I love it, but I'm not racist and I would probably be against a restraining order."

It's a joke because it's what it is. It's a joke because it's what it is. It's what it is. It's a joke because it's what it is.
47,27,You've got a good point.
47,31,The CDC is trying to stop a virus spread. The CDC is trying to get rid of that virus.
50,47,CANNOTANSWER:
53,47,The most dangerous thing that I've heard about the government is that they can't stop the spread of AIDS.
54,47,So... it was a joke about what the CDC is implementing to stop the spread of HIV.
58,47,"""What is it a joke?"","
61,47,The people who are vaccinated need to know that this is not a joke.
93,47,I'm not an official CIA official but I've been around for a while.
47,9,>[...you can wear a mask and get a vaccine if you are willing. It's a joke because it's what it is. It is a joke because it's what it is. It is a joke because it's what it is.
47,24,It seems that the President has already come to terms with a lot of his remark here.
47,25,"So, a CIA employee who is actually actually a member of the CDC, and who claims to be one of the people who is trying to prevent AIDS with a mask of a mask, if she doesn't have AIDS. That's a'mocking a masked mask.'"
47,27,Are you saying the CDC isn't going to have the chance to prevent the spread of the virus? Because it seems very likely that the President is trying to stop a virus spread by inventing a vaccine that isn't already being prescribed?
47,31,I'm not even a racist or racist either.
50,47,Why would he want to go back to the military for a few days?
53,47,A lot of pranks are about the government. It's all about a joke.
54,47,The joke just doesn’t make sense because it says so in the title. Is there a different word to the CDC?
58,47,You are a funny dude who doesn't understand how a joke isn't a joke
61,47,"No joke, this is a joke."
93,47,"[As of this writing, the article has already been posted more than 1 million times on the front page, a lot of people are not even rereading the entire article in order to understand why it is called a conspiracy."
47,9,They could be a joke because that would be the end of it.
47,24,"This is a joke and a joke. It's a joke because it isn't a joke and the President isn't going to get any sort of response from the public, but it's a joke because a joke isn't a joke."
47,25,I'm going to say this about twitchcon and masks you can hate me if the state town doesn t have any mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear one.'
47,27,There are a lot of things that the people mentioning the CDC are attempting to prevent.
47,31,"I'm not racist or racist, I'm not racist. The Obama administration is a joke. It's a joke. Vaccination is an important part of the health system. The CDC is trying to stop the spread of a virus."
50,47,Vaccination is a joke that doesn't involve any type of vaccine. Is that really a joke? Then what?
53,47,It's a joke for him to say: It's just a joke. If he doesn't like it then he shouldn't want it.
54,47,"In that article, you said that you have no idea what 'hippy' means."
58,47,"I don't know what the difference between a joke and a joke is. I think the joke is the jokes that the people are making about him and the president, as well as the other issues."
61,47,Vaccination is an important part of the healthcare system.
93,47,I'm not an official CIA official but I've been around for a while. I'm a little naive to say that I'm just saying that the government has the right to protect the public.
47,9,I'm just going to say this:
47,24,That is the whole point. The CDC is trying to stop the spread of a virus.
47,25,"You are a joke about the CDC, not the CDC."
47,27,Vaccination is an important part of the health system. The CDC is trying to stop the spread of a virus. The CDC is trying to prevent it. The CDC is attempting to control it.
47,31,I'm sorry to hear that this is in the wrong place.
50,47,"""But it's not a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke."""
53,47,"I'm going to try to help. If you can't, it's a joke."
54,47,"> ""How much did it cost?"
58,47,Vaccination is the only way to prevent the spread of a virus.
61,47,What do they mean a joke is a joke?
93,47,"I'm a black guy, but I'm not the only white person on the internet."
47,9,I'm in a hurry for this.
47,24,"""What are the things that the people mentioning the CDC are trying to stop.'"""
47,25,Vaccination is important part of the health system. Vaccination is an important part of the health system.
47,27,"Well, it's a joke. It's a joke because they're trying to help the country to stop HIV/AIDS, but it's an important part of the health system."
47,31,"What's a joke? What is a joke? The answer is ""I'm not the only one in the US who is a joke""."
50,47,I think the problem with this joke is that it is not a joke.
53,47,Because I'm a doctor and don't think the US government is making the money off the ACA.
54,47,"The whole idea of having a mask isn't really a joke. It's a joke because people want to be on the receiving end of a joke, they want a joke to go against their own agenda."
58,47,"Vaccination is the only way to prevent the spread of the virus. It seems that even though it's a joke, the word 'joke' is used and used by politicians who do not have a lot of money in their hands."
61,47,So I'm going to use [NAME] to make a joke about TWickcon?
93,47,"Assuming you're not a sexist, 'candy' or a troll, I would say the CIA is an insular entity, like the National Security Agency, but in a conspiracy."
47,9,"CANNOTANSWER THIS WITHOUT THE CDC, MADE BY THE US."
47,24,I just want to say that the article is the only time I've been at the CDC.
47,25,Vaccination is an important part of the health system. It is an important part of the health system. It is a joke because it's what it is.
47,27,It's a joke. It's a joke because of the administration's efforts to stop the spread of HIV.
47,31,"I'm in no way racist, but I've been vaccinated. I feel like if someone was the president I'd be there to fight."
50,47,Well a lot of those jokes and all the other ones seem to me to have been petty. I would never have believed them.
53,47,It's also a joke that the CDC is trying to sue for because the government can't stop AIDS.
54,47,">The whole idea of having a mask isn't really a joke. It's a joke because people want to be on the receiving end of a joke, they want a joke to go against their own agenda."
58,47,"Vaccination is a joke. It's a joke. You're saying it's a joke, but it's not."
61,47,A joke is a joke. A joke is not a joke. A joke is a joke because it's a joke.
93,47,I thought that the fact that they're going to change the rules would be the beginning of the end for a lot of people who don't want to take it seriously.
47,9,"You are being sarcastic and using words that can be used to communicate things like this is not good. There is no need for you to be a slut and the word can't be used to make jokes. I find it hard to believe that it's a joke, because it's not what it is."
47,24,I don't like the idea of dressing like a joke. I don't like the idea of dressing like an idiot but I think that's a good thing for me.
47,25,"The Obama administration is a joke and I think this story is not funny. I think it's just ridiculous that people are so angry about the CDC, and don't know what is going on in the comments about a CIA employee."
47,27,There's a big difference between what is really a joke and what is actually a joke.
47,31,"Vaccination isn't a joke. It's a joke that the president has made in his own country, but it's a joke that the US government isn't doing anything wrong, especially after all the years that this hasn't happened."
50,47,The thing is that a lot of people who use a mask are making a joke to the administration.
53,47,">The problem with those comments is that they are trying to do a “good thing” that would be a joke, and then being forced to stop it by censoring the spread of AIDS. Vaccination isn't a joke because the idea that the people who have the disease would be forced to use a mask, and not the disease itself. That is what the person who would have to pay to go to the CDC for treatment has to do."
54,47,"This is one of those things where the jokes are not as funny as the jokes. The jokes are sarcastic, but they’re not really a joke."
58,47,It's a joke. It's not a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.
61,47,"I'm not saying the joke is racist or not, but I'm saying the idea of wearing a mask is funny and I want to make a joke. I don't want to make a joke but I'm not going to say anything offensive here."
93,47,I'm glad that you think it's a conspiracy theory.
47,9,The CDC is working on a shitstorm. I'm just putting my finger on it.
47,24,People in this subreddit are often confused by things that aren't part of the headline. I'd not be surprised if people on that subreddit are talking about the Obama administration. They're talking about something that isn't a joke but has been really around for a while now.
47,25,"That article, 'This is an interesting conversation', is the first post I've seen of this guy defending the Obama administration's ""juke, but that's not what it is. It's not a joke."""
47,27,"Vaccination is not a joke, it is a way to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS. The only reason the president isn't trying to stop the CDC is because they are trying to keep the government out of that situation."
47,31,"If you read the entire article (except for the sidebar), there are two words:"
50,47,A lot of those jokes and all the other ones seem to me to have been petty.
53,47,"Viruses do not spread in all places, as far as I know, in America."
54,47,No wonder it's funny to read a doctor joking about the CDC implementing a vaccine program in his absence. The CDC resents him for a joke and will keep him on the edge of his seat.
58,47,The president's attempts to keep everyone safe are the worst thing that can be done to stop a virus.
61,47,"The issue with the CDC is not just about what the government is doing, it's also about what the CDC has been doing since the start. The CDC has been preventing people from putting a mask on themselves or having sex with someone that is unvaccinated."
93,47,So that's a conspiracy.
47,9,"There's a difference between ""no jokes,"" ""no jokes"" and ""we aren't doing anything wrong."" And when I was a kid I'd say ""what is funny"" to people, but I wasn't really surprised about the CDC. It was a joke because it benefited my kid's life, but when I started reading that ""it's a joke, but it's not a joke."" But you also know what I mean. It was a joke."
47,24,"If you say anything about the topic of terrorism at the CDC and you're trying to show the government it's not a joke, that's a joke."
47,25,This is what people like to hear a lot on this sub. This is where I get the point.
47,27,"You could say ""But it would be rude if the state didn't get mandates to allow people to get vaccinated because of a lack of vaccines."
47,31,"I'm not racist or racist, I'm not racist."
50,47,I don't think it's really a joke.
53,47,That would just make a good prank.
54,47,I just had the opportunity to meet some people on r/cdc.
58,47,This is a very funny and funny article. It's about the president and the administration in general.
61,47,"In my opinion, they are all going to have to do a lot of different things for the public to be able to properly understand the context and what the jokes are about. If you're being offended, the jokes are about how the government will make things worse."
93,47,I’d say you’re being a little bit wrong. I was actually a troll on one of the comments above.
47,9,"The CDC is actually trying to try to prevent the spread of AIDS. They are trying to use hiveminds to prevent AIDS, not to prevent it from spreading."
47,24,"It sounds like an Obama-esque 'joke', and that's the kind of thing I think is funny, but not something that I am trying to get over."
47,25,"In my opinion, this is the correct way to phrase it, and it is a joke."
47,27,"It sounds like they're just trying to avenge their own mistakes, but I think it is going to be nice to get rid of all the ""c""s and ""c""s he has that can prevent and prevent a disease."
47,31,Vaccination is a joke. It is the only thing that can stop a virus from spreading. It is not the joke.
50,47,What about a government shutdown?
53,47,"Why do I feel the need to use the CDC as a prank? If it's about you, it's just another joke."
54,47,"You may be correct but a lot of people in the US believe in a fake CDC, and if you want to see an article about it, you should look for a fake CDC article with an actual CDC article on it."
58,47,"It's a joke because the president has been threatening to bring the president down. This is a joke because the president is trying to fool the president into acting like it's a joke and making fun of the president to put him in jail, and then putting a joke about the Obama Administration."
61,47,"The CDC is trying to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS by making the ACA a joke, and the other two are making fun of it. The ACA is not racist. The ACA is a joke because the government isn't racist. It is racist because it's racist. The CDC wants to make fun of the Obama administration."
93,47,"If the CIA and the Bush administration conspire to force the CIA to stop sex in a country that has a CIA-funded surveillance program, that's a conspiracy."
47,9,Vaccination is a joke because it's an important part of the health system. It isn't a joke because it's not a joke.
47,24,"""... because the CDC is... a prank because they're trying to prevent the spread of a virus."""
47,25,"This isn't a a joke, it's a satire."

47,31,"I've seen this one so many times. I know it's true, but I also understand that being a troll is not a joke, but it is a joke."
50,47,That joke has become a joke. But there is nothing to be said to stop people from getting sick because they don't wear masks. If you're on the fence you're just going to be a joke.
53,47,I'm on the fence about vaccination and the CDC is the only way to stop it.
54,47,"You don't need to understand the context of the post, but you are absolutely correct. Vaccination is a joke because it prevents the spread of HIV. It's not a joke because it's about how people don't know how to stop the spread of AIDS. The CDC is trying to stop the spread of AIDS. Vaccination is a joke because it prevents the spread of HIV. It's a joke because it is about the people causing the spread of HIV. It's a joke, but if you are a joke,"

47,24,"Nope. You're right, you're being racist. You're not racist. It's a joke. It's a joke."
47,25,The joke is a satire. The joke is a satire. It's not funny at all.
47,27,"You're absolutely right that there's some difference. In the context of the CDC, we don't have a mandate to provide vaccines. There's just the fact that the CDC is trying to make a joke about their actions."
47,31,"Vaccination is a joke that is trying to be a joke, because it prevents the spread of HIV. The CDC is trying to be a joke because it prevents the spread of HIV."
50,47,I don't think there's anything that is more hilarious and funny than the CDC.
53,47,That's the thing. Vaccination is a joke and they want to sue them for not covering their face with the vaccine.
54,47,"i do not think you are being racist, and no one on this subreddit has ever mentioned the government swaying the people of this subreddit like you are. you are a little naive, a troll and a troll"
