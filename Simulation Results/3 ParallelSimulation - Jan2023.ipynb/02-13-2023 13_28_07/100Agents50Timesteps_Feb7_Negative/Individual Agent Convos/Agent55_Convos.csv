58,55,"If it's not a joke, then you can still take a picture of the CDC on your face. It's the CDC's only way to prevent AIDS, and it's only the one that's used for protection a little longer than they have been used."
66,55,What the doctor said was exactly what I was thinking.

55,21,This is an incredibly long post.
55,31,“...I think wearing a mask is the best way to stop the spread of a virus. Please wear masks.
55,34,"It's not like there's anything that makes the CDC do something like this. They're doing things like the CDC's anti-vaccine propaganda for the sake of spreading disease, but also to prevent the spread of that disease."
56,55,I'm just curious to know what the difference between the two.
58,55,Obama hasn't been able to have a virus. He's not going to have to work to prevent the spread of the virus.

55,5,I'm not sure the difference is the amount of people that think that being able to get into an abortion is not a joke.
55,15,"I see the point of these sentences. The CDC is not going to let the President continue to go to any lengths to protect people, besides protecting his own health and the health of his family, for example, if they would stop doing the things they are doing that would make people sick. The CDC isn't doing anything shady for those reasons."
55,21,Vaccination is a joke.
55,31,"I was actually thinking about it, but my understanding of what it means for him was very similar to yours: the CIA is not allowed to use the Vaccination Vaccination Act to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS. Vaccination is a joke. It isn't a joke."
55,34,"And in this post, if you aren't a vaccinated person, it's not just about your husband. It's also about your husband and you need to ask a doctor about it. It could be that he's not allowed to do things like that. A restraining order is a legal restriction to the wear of a mask."
56,55,It is a joke because the joke is in the background.
58,55,Ingraham said it's restricting our rights to keep us locked in.
66,55,He is a bit of a pedant. If this is a joke I will tell you this is a joke because he's actually a good person.
86,55,So what if the US government was using a restraining order in the U.S. that would prevent this from happening again?
93,55,"I have a strong anti-terrorism policy against white people, and it’s a conspiracy theory. If I don’t sneer at people in the CIA, then I sneer at them. I sneer at them, but I sneer at them too."

55,5,'The CIA and CIA are the problem.'
55,15,I think this is a very good point. The president has a lot of sarcasm and a few naive comments about the administration.
55,21,"Vaccination is a joke, if you think you have a point, you are not a joke."
55,31,I mean the entire point isn't that people don't understand the role of the government. The only reason that he believes that it's a joke is because he doesn't think a person who has a medical or scientific knowledge will understand that the government is trying to be an asshole. Those words have been thrown around as a joke.
55,34,Vaccination is a joke and a joke because it isn't a joke.

55,15,The President has made a lot of jokes about the US government. It is a bit dickish.
55,21,I see this as something in the middle of an over-simplified conversation. Probably a good idea.
55,31,"I think you're being a little harsh, and maybe you're not, but it sounds like you have a very good sense of humor."
55,34,The white people don't care about the virus. It's a joke and a joke because it's not a joke.
56,55,The only difference between the two is that he can't be right with saying that he's a troll because he's not racist and a troll because he is racist and a troll and they're trying to discredit him for his bad work.
58,55,So you have to have two separate words.
66,55,"I don't even know why people are making jokes, but what really makes this a joke is that people are being 'fucking dumb'."
86,55,"I'm not sure if that is what it is, but there are a lot of things on the wiki."

55,21,"No, this isn't a joke. It's a joke."
55,31,A restraining order is a legal restriction on the wear of a mask.
55,34,It's a joke because the person who made the joke is a racist. This has nothing to do with the president.
56,55,"I have a very difficult time deciding which part to tell you, unless I've found a better diction. I have a very good head, and I love my job and the doctor I'm a friend of was the one who came back when I went to school. He had a PTSD med. I lost my lungs and I felt bad for him. I got really tired after that. He had a stroke. It was so bad, and I ate his whole lungs. And I hardly feel good about myself if he would get a second"
58,55,This is not a joke at all. This is a joke because it's an attempt to protect people.
66,55,"I ain't racist. If it were me I'd be so happy that they tried. Vaccination isn't a joke. It's a joke because it's not mandated. But in addition, it's a joke because it's mandated."
