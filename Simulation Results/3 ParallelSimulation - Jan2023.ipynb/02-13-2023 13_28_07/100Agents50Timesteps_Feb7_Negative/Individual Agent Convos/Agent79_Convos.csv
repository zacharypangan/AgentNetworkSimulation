79,32,"I love that you said that because you are right, but you will never know if you'll be able to say your mouth on the internet. It is very interesting how the idea of having a shield for your face and eyes is the same as in an ear-to-ear hearing mask."

79,37,OP is missing the op's link on this and they are wrong about wearing a mask when being in charge of an organization.
79,43,So the government will be a state with no mandates?
79,46,i cant believe it. what kind of shit is shady?
79,54,"If they don't have mandatory mandatory vaccines they shouldn't need to wear a mask. I think the answer is that they don't have to. Honestly, I don't know if it's all that controversial or if you're just being naive."

79,60,It's funny. Why would anyone want to be an assistant at the NSA. They are going to want a president like that.

79,66,"The point is to avoid getting into a twitchcon debate about the health care slam on Trump, not the politics of the event."
80,79,In that case he needs to get a restraining order before he can start playing the games.
82,79,i agree with you. i would rather wear a mask than a mask and not get vaccinated than have one at a twitchcon. the issue is that i have a problem with sd vaccination laws and that they are not mandated.
83,79,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

83,79,"This is really cool. It's one of the smartest things in the world to want people to be able to live their lives, not die to a virus. It's not like there's something to talk about. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks."

80,79,So what does wearing a mask say about vaccines?
82,79,"Vaccination is not a law, it is not a law. It is a violation of health law. It is not a law to require vaccinations."
83,79,It's not a prank. It's a joke. It's like someone using a sexy idiom to fuck an evil pedophile.
79,2,It's not the same as a joke.
79,32,It is a joke. Isn't it safe to not wear a mask? Because it's the only way to protect you from infections. It's a fucking joke that a few people are still sneezing at when they rant about the health care slam on Trump.

79,46,I agree with you here. There are some major flaws in Obama's health care policy in the states that they're not required' to follow it.
79,54,Why are you talking about the health care slams on Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton?

82,79,It is a violation of health law. It is not a law to require vaccines. The only way to stop it is to put on a mask so you can be vaccinated.
83,79,"I think the problem is that the government isn't a terrorist organization, so the problem is people wearing a mask. They don't want people to know about the 'proves' of the virus."

79,33,Afaik is not a joke. The fact that he's being nice to the people that are wearing him is so funny. It's funny but it's a joke. The fact that he's being nice to the people that are wearing him is so funny. It's funny but it's a joke.
79,37,Vaccines are a good idea but they aren't really what they were made for.
79,43,"It was very similar to saying: 'It’s a joke, and I don’t think it’s a joke. The government can’t stop the spread of a virus without a mask."
79,46,Obama is a horrible man. And what a pathetic joke.
79,54,You need to stop reading. I can't think of any legitimate reason to not use the word 'joke' as an excuse to tell someone not to wear a mask for the sake of health care. Probably doesn't look right.
79,56,"I'm not sure what the idiom is. The idiom is called saber mask, which is the word for afaik. It's the word that we use in senate politics."
79,60,The CIA is a joke that can not prevent people from getting vaccines because they will be spreading a vaccine.
79,62,We should be more aware that afaik is a joke.
79,66,I don't know why they are wanting to ban it.
80,79,Vaccination is the best way to prevent the spread of a virus. It is basically a way to protect your own health.
82,79,> The first thing I would say is I don't care about the CDC/POLICE or their vaccination policy unless I was vaccinated
83,79,What was the 'best thing to do' to stop the spread of a virus?
79,2,"I think people are reading this but aren't that familiar with the idiom ""Afaik"". The CIA wants to ban it because it doesn't actually stop the spread of a virus. Afaik is a joke, as in Afaik is the only way to stop a virus."
79,32,I'm assuming the CDC is being more serious than the CIA is?
79,33,This is the first time I've heard something like that referred to as a prank.
79,37,"He's trying to be narcissistic by not wearing a mask and saying something like, ""Afaik is a joke."""
79,43,It sounds like they're both lying.
79,46,Vaccines are a good idea but they aren’t really what they were made for. It’s very similar to saying: “I don’t care about the CDC/POLICE or their vaccination policy unless I was vaccinated”.
79,54,>The first thing I would say is I don't care about the CDC/POLICE or their vaccination policy unless I was vaccinated What was the 'best thing to do' to stop the spread of a virus. What was the 'best thing to do' to stop the spread of a virus?
79,56,It's a joke. It is a joke.
79,60,Vaccination is a good idea but it doesn’t stop the spread of a virus. It’s basically a way to protect your own health.
79,62,There's a lot of overlap between the two.
79,66,We've been told by the press that Obama is a horrible man. And what a pathetic joke.
80,79,I would rather have the job of a doctor
82,79,"That is a great joke. They need to fucking make it legally possible. They need to make it law, and then make it legal again so the president can stop being racist."
83,79,He's making a joke that isn't actually funny. Isn't that the reason why he doesn't think it's funny? It sounds like he's using an unintended idiom.
79,2,"Afaik is a joke, as in Afaik is the only way to stop a virus."
79,32,Vaccination is actually an option for people who need to get vaccinated. But it's not a way to prevent the spread of a virus. It's a way to protect yourself from spreading a virus. The problem is vaccinations. The problem is vaccines.
79,33,I am afraid I am the fucking fucking narrator.
79,37,The fact that he's being nice to the people that are wearing him is so funny. It's funny but it's a prank. He's trying to be a dick. It's funny and a prank. He's trying to be a dick. It's funny but it's a joke. It sounds like they're both lying. Vaccines are a good idea but they aren't really what they were made for. It's very similar to saying:
79,43,"As a CDC patient I think this makes me sad, especially given the lack of CDC's funding. I'm assuming the CDC is being more serious than the NSA."
79,46,Vaccination is a good idea but it doesn't stop the spread of a virus.
79,54,"I don't think I understand how he's going to be so smug about his own health? Because he resents the public because his jokes are fucking ridiculous. Besides he's a politician and his 'pranks' are being a hoax, he's not a politician. His idiom is that he doesn't want people to do their own health care and not to be in danger of getting hurt."
79,56,The CIA is trying to ban it because it can't stop the spread of a virus. The CDC/POLICE is a joke that can not prevent people from getting vaccines because they will be spreading a virus. We should be more aware that afaik is a joke.
79,60,If they want a fake NSA mask that doesn't work. They can use that mask to get people to get infected if the NSA wants to. But they can't just ban a fake mask.
79,62,"It was just a joke for a few minutes... but then I read what I wrote. I got what I wanted. The joke started out as a joke... and then I got it. Then when I saw what the joke was, I got the idea that if a joke were made about the government they would just ban it, and then they would just ban it."
79,66,"> ""We need to fucking make it legal possible. They need to make it law, and then make it legal again so the president can stop being racist."""
80,79,The CDC is a legitimate business. The players are the authority figures. They are the government’s protector. The CDC is the government’s protector. They are the only authority to keep people safe. Vaccination is necessary to protect the body.
82,79,What is the point of the article if the president refuses to use his position to stop the spread of a virus?
83,79,It's funny that you don't want to think he's using a joke.
79,2,"""We don't have a right to wear a mask."""
79,32,The CIA is the only authority to keep people safe. They can use that mask to get people infected if they want to. But it's not a way to prevent the spread of a virus.
79,33,This is a good joke. I'm the narrator of this.
79,37,I'd rather have the job of a doctor.
79,43,Is the president saying that his 'peeps are racist' joke?
79,46,">""I can't believe it. what kind of shit is shady?'"
79,54,"The reason for a joke isn't that it's funny, it's that a joke isn't funny because it's a joke and that it's a joke. Vaccination is the only way to stop a virus. But it's not what they were made for."
79,56,I'm going to go ahead and say that if the CDC/POLICE bans it I'm not surprised if it's actually making some sense.
79,60,There's a lot of overlap between the two. There's a lot of overlap between the two.
79,62,"Vaccines are a joke, because they're a way to protect people from the spread of a virus."
79,66,"The CDC doesn't have the same funding as the CDC (it is a legitimate business). It's the only authority figure to protect people who need to be vaccinated. It doesn't work either. I'm not a lawyer or anything, but I do know what you mean by afaik."
80,79,Vaccination is only a joke because of the spread of the virus.
82,79,I’d be scared. I don’t think I’d want to go to a vaccinated party.
83,79,It's not a prank. It's a joke. I have no idea why you're being offended.
79,2,This is the joke. Is it a joke if the US government doesn't have the authority to ban it or censor it for any reason?
79,32,"I’ve been playing jokes for years. I’m not sure how to answer them or how to answer them. But, there’s a lot of overlap between the two, a number where it could be used as a joke."
79,33,“Afaik is not a joke. It's funny but it's a joke. The fact that he's being nice to the people that are wearing him is so funny.”
79,37,The NSA and CDC are not in the same country. They are not policing the government. They are operating on the same principle as any other policing authority.
79,43,So the President's question is what kind of person is in the middle of doing a prank about the government?
79,46,Well there is no reason for me to believe it's a joke. It's a joke that is making my head hurt.
79,54,Vaccination is the only way to prevent the spread of a virus. Vaccination is the only way to stop the spread of a virus. But it's not what they were made for.
79,56,"""We need to fucking make it legal possible. They need to make it law, and then make it legal again so the president can stop being racist."""
79,60,Vaccination is a joke. They can use that mask to get people infected if the NSA wants to. But they can’t just ban a fake mask.
79,62,The CDC has the right to make a fake afaik mask that works
79,66,"Vaccines are a joke, because they're necessary to protect people from the spread of the virus."
80,79,"It's pretty clear that a joke about the CDC is not a joke, especially because it explains why the CDC is trying to take people to hospitals for a certain amount of vaccines."
82,79,"I don't think that's a joke at all. It's actually pretty funny, but I think a lot of people who are a bit off about sd vaccines haven't thought about it and it makes them uncomfortable or offensive to them."
83,79,"I'd be more offended to hear that a guy with the AIDS virus said to me that he didn't know how to prank because his mom was sick of being on the couch because it was a prank, rather than a prank. I'd like to think he knew how to do it. Certainly not the same as a prankster."
79,2,"They are trying to ban the use of afaik. Vaccines are not necessary to prevent the spread of AIDS, but they are necessary to prevent the spread of a virus."
79,32,"So, what's this dreaded prank?"
79,33,"Vaccines are a joke, because they are necessary to prevent the spread of a virus. But they are not what they were made for."
79,37,"The president has repeatedly said this in the past, and it's obvious to me that this is a serious case. The president hasn't said anything to this particular person and if the president deems himself to be a dick or funny, he's simply putting a 'dick' in the middle of the issue."
79,43,Afaik is a joke. It's a joke.
79,46,Vaccines are the only way to prevent the spread of a virus. The CDC and the CDC don't have the same funding. It's the only authority figure to protect people who need to be vaccinated. It doesn't work either.
79,54,"I'm going to call him a prankster, but not a politician..."
79,56,"Afaik isn't a joke. I don't know what it means, but I think people are being offended because the CDC is trying to ban the use of the mask."
79,60,"The people who want to take their kids to a prank party have just become a bunch of fucking idiots, just like most other people on this subreddit."
79,62,They're both being racist. They can't make a joke about it.
79,66,You mean the CDC is not a legitimate business?
80,79,This is the best kind of shit you could ask the CDC to take you to.
82,79,"Vaccination is a joke, a joke about a vaccination."
83,79,"""What a prank is when you see a man make fun of you for his knowledge of what a prank is and they tell you it is based on it. It's called a prank. The truth is that a prank that is actually a joke is a prank."
79,2,"They're trying to ban vaccination, so I guess that's where the joke ends."
79,32,Its really a prank.
79,33,"Vaccines aren't jokes. The people who want to take their kids to a prank party have just become a bunch of fucking idiots, just like most other people on this subreddit."
79,37,"There is a joke here. The people who want to go to a prank party have just become a bunch of fucking idiots, just like most other people on this subreddit. They're both being racist. They can't make a joke about it."
79,43,It's an argument for both side. AIDS isn't something that can't be stopped. It's just a symptom of what can happen.
79,46,It's a joke. The government isn't required to regulate afaik as the CDC is. It's just that they don't have the authority to ban afaik at all.
79,54,"""The reason for a joke isn't that it's funny, it's that a joke isn't funny because it's a joke"""
79,56,So... we're getting into an incredibly illogical situation. Why does that even matter?
79,60,Vaccines are a joke and a joke about the CDC.
79,62,"Afaik is a joke, not a joke."
79,66,"""It's pretty clear that a prank about the CDC is not a joke. They can use that mask to get people infected if the NSA wants to. But they can't just ban a fake afaik mask that works Vaccines are the only way to prevent the spread of a virus. It’s pretty clear that a joke about the CDC is not a joke."
80,79,You just told me that. This is how you learn to live.
82,79,"I want you to read the article. I mean, it's probably an interesting story."
83,79,I'm pretty sure a lot of people here are actually serious about AIDS. It is the most egregious thing in the world. And I'm sure it is a joke despite all of the stigma associated with AIDS. But it is a prank because it's a joke. So we can't stop it. It's just a joke.
79,2,You can tell the truth. This is what a prank is. This is how you learn to live.
79,32,The CDC isn't the problem. The problem is vaccination.
79,33,The fact that he's being nice to the people that are wearing him is so funny. It's funny but it's a joke.
79,37,Vaccines aren't a joke. It's a joke. It isn't a joke.
79,43,"They're not making jokes about the CDC, they're making jokes about it, they're making a joke about the CDC."
79,46,Vaccines are not a joke. They are a joke. A joke.
79,54,"Yes, I'm a troll who does not care about the health care slams. What is a joke, as if it were a joke?"
79,56,"This is the best way to get the political correctness right, that's all."
79,60,"This is a joke, and the CDC has no authority to ban it."
79,62,"I mean, what's the point of a prank?"
79,66,It is not a joke. It is an argument that you've been told that you are a racist.
80,79,That’s a bit of a joke. A mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
82,79,> You have a problem with sd vaccination laws and that they are not mandated.'
83,79,There's an article about a joke that is called a prank.
79,2,I can relate to that joke.
79,32,"""Waiting a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.Vaccines are a joke and a joke about the CDC. Vaccines are a joke, not a joke."
79,33,So it isn't a joke?
79,37,"People are not making fun of him, they are trying to tell him the truth. ""I know a joke isn't a joke."
79,43,"I'm not sure what the joke is : that it is a joke, the joke doesn't mean that the CDC is a joke. This is why the vaccine issue is so widespread in the CDC."
79,46,I'm not saying that this is a joke. I think that there's a lot to think about.
79,54,This is what a joke is. It is a joke about the CDC. They can't use that mask to get people infected if they want to. But they can't just ban a fake afaik mask that works. Vaccines are not a joke.
79,56,Vaccines are the only way to prevent the spread of a virus.
79,60,"I'm a fan of the CIA, but this is a great piece of shit. They are literally making a joke about the CDC. That's just one of the few things that i can think of that are true."
79,62,Afaik isn't a joke. A prank is a joke about the government.
79,66,He's asking if anyone in the CIA knows what a joke is. Apparently it's only for the joke of people like Obama who don't like the idea of slams.
80,79,"""I like to wear masks"" and "" I love how they're putting a few comments into it."""

79,2,"In terms of a prank, the first phrase is ""Afaik."" It's a joke about the CIA."
79,32,"Vaccines are a joke, not a joke."
79,33,This is a prank.
79,37,"Afaik is not a joke, it's a joke. Vaccines are a joke and a joke about the government."
79,43,Afaik does not require vaccinations. Vaccines aren't supposed to stop the spread of a virus without a mask. Vaccines are the only way to prevent a virus. Vaccines aren't a joke. They need to fucking make it legal again so the president can stop being racist. I think it's a joke.
79,46,What a joke. I've heard lots of racist jokes about NSA. I guess that's why they're making it a joke. It's not like they're able to ban the NSA to prevent the spread of a virus.
79,54,I'm really not a fan of Obamacare.

79,66,What the hell is a prank about this? The president has a problem with afaik.
80,79,There is no joke about putting a mask on a guy wearing it without having a mask on. He’s a prankster.
82,79,"I was at TwitchCon as a kid, and while I don't think people were getting vaccinated (like that's not the case), the joke is a bit of a hunch: the CDC is trying to force a federal mandate on the government to stop the spread of a virus.

79,46,The whole 'obama is not a joke' comment 'I don't know what to say to those who are referring to the joke' is actually really pathetic.
79,54,"Vaccines are not a joke because they are not a joke, because they are not mandated."
79,56,The president is making the point that if a man gets vaccinated and dies then he must die. If they make a joke about him and he does then it's because he has a problem with the government.
79,60,They're just trying to convince the people of their misinformation that they don't know much about the CIA and the CDC and aren't able to ban them.

79,33,"I thought they were making a prank out of an axe, but that's too easy to read."
79,37,"The CDC, and most of the government, will never have policing policies that aren't necessary for a healthy life. The CDC and NSA are both in the same country and will have policing systems in place. It is not the only one that has policing systems, and they are narcissistic. They aren't in the same country as the CDC and the NSA. They are not in the same country. The CDC and NSA aren't operational."
79,43,There's more to this than the narcotics joke. It's only about Obamacare being the only nationalized drug problem.
79,46,This apologies. But the rest of it is a joke.
79,54,"Obamacare is the only insurance system in the world that gives vaccines. They are in control of the CDC and are not mandated. The CDC and CDC are not mandated, so they are not mandated. This isn't a prank. They're not mandated. The only govt agency in the US has a mandate. They have a mandate."
79,56,I think I read a lot of this.

79,62,I think you are not being sarcastic. But it's interesting that people like Trump are not only joking about the government's stance but also their understanding of the meaning of a joke in general. So you've got something to be ashamed of - because it sounds like a joke.

79,37,"This is just an excuse to ignore a few examples of why the CIA is a terrorist organization.... I’m so sorry, but I’m gonna have to read this again. I’m just going to put the mask on."
79,43,Vaccines are not mandated. The government doesn't have the authority to ban them because of the CDC.
79,46,"And as I understand it, a joke is a joke a joke and a joke is a joke. A joke is a joke."
79,54,I'm a little confused - a guy whose job is to vaccinate people is not a politician - and his smirk isn't about any of this.
79,56,It seems like he's been getting too used to it.
79,60,"I think this is pretty funny, but I think a lot of people who are a bit off about sd vaccinations haven’t thought about it and it makes them uncomfortable."
79,62,"Yes, I haven't seen it before and don't know why you haven't seen it."
79,66,I see what you mean. It's a joke. I think it's a joke and not a joke. It is an argument that he's being a bit off about the fact that his stance on vaccines is a joke. He can't stop being racist.
80,79,I don’t see why it’s even a joke.
82,79,Vaccines are not a joke. They are a joke. They are not a law. It is not a law to require vaccines.
83,79,I would also like to say that the CIA censored the word 'afaik' and they did the same thing when they used a joke in a joke.
79,2,No thanks. No thanks.No thanks.No thanks.No thanks.No thanks.No thanks.No thanks.No thanks.No thanks.No thanks.No thanks.No thanks.No thanks.No thanks.No thanks.No thanks.No thanks.No thanks.No thanks.No thanks.No thanks.No thanks.No thanks.No thanks.No thanks.No thanks.
79,32,"It's funny because the jokes on this subreddit aren't jokes. But the ol''msa's, which was used to decipher jokes is still humorous and isn't really a joke."
79,33,I'm a big Obama supporter of Vaccines in the US.
79,37,Is this the same guy who told people to vote for the president?
79,43,"afaik is a joke, and it's a joke."
79,46,They are going to ban vaccines and will be able to go about that.

79,56,"The president's trying to censor the word as if he weren't a joke, because the CDC and the NSA both use a joke to make the president seem less racist."
79,60,"I think the CIA is trying to force a government mandate on the CDC, but they're not willing to change it."
79,62,People are more aware of the problems than the jokes.
79,66,I’ve seen this prank before.
80,79,"I think it’s funny and humorous, but I find it very interesting and a little funny because I was in an actual public office for a couple of years. I just think it’s a good thing that people think it’s a joke - it’s a joke about being the CDC and not about it being a joke."
82,79,>The first line was actually an interesting one.
83,79,-[ afaik is a joke].
79,2,"'Afaik' (which is a joke, as in 'Afaik is the only way to stop a virus.') is a joke that was made out of sheer wit and not from an official perspective."
79,32,It's not a joke. It's a joke.
79,33,"I'm actually confused because I've been in the military a few times and I had an afaik and afaik about something, so it was pretty a joke."
79,37,The first line was actually an interesting one. -[Tim: afaik is a joke](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim:)

79,46,Obama’s health care policy was designed to do nothing to prevent the spread of a virus.
79,54,"The CDC, a political organization, a politician, an organisation that isn't an 'authority' of government, aren't mandated. They're not mandated."
79,56,... Then you will have to accept the fact that I’m the fucking idiot for asking this question in the title.

79,66,It would make the whole conversation seem like a bit too much for you to explain in a grammatically correct way.
80,79,I think this is about the fact that the guy who says it is a joke is the first person I’ve met. But I think it is a joke that the guy who says it’s a joke would be a prankster.
82,79,"It would be better to have a joke about how the CDC and the US government is attempting to make vaccines legal, but it does not have to be made legal."
83,79,"The only thing I can think of from that video is the fact that it's funny and not a joke. I'm going to take a look at the word 'afaik' and then say ""This is funny. I don't think this is a joke. The joke is a joke because it's a joke, but they do want people to know about the 'proves' of the virus."", ""I'm pretty sure a lot of people here are actually serious about the 'prank"""
79,2,CANNOTANSWER WHAT I SAY.
79,32,"Afaik is a joke because vaccines aren't a joke because vaccines aren't. It's a joke because vaccines are a joke, because they're a joke."
79,33,"He's joking about it all, but it's not a joke. It's a joke, not a joke. It's a joke, but it's a joke. The fact that he's being nice to the people that are wearing him is a joke, but it's a joke."
79,37,"I don't think that is actually a joke. If it's a joke, if you want to take a joke about it, take a joke about how they are a joke. They should make it illegal, but if you want to take a joke, take a joke about it."
79,43,)I’m a CDC patient and I’m a CDC patient.
79,46,"What if Obama started doing a stunt for the CDC? He might be making a joke about it, but if he does, then he will do it."
79,54,I think the CDC is being mandated. They're the only govt agency in the US that gives vaccines. Vaccines are not mandated. They're not mandated. Vaccines are not mandated. They're not mandated.
79,56,"As someone who’s never gotten the fuck out of the military, I would say, ""This guy got a lot of shit off, but he just won’t stop because he’s racist. He’s being so naive that he’s not going to put up with that for a long time."""

79,62,"The whole ""why wouldn't anyone want to be an assistant at the NSA"" thing is a joke, but it's about the problem with vaccines. They don't want to give them as a joke, but they can make a joke about them."
79,66,>[The first line was actually an interesting one.
80,79,"So I like to read a few things, but I find it extremely unhelpful."
82,79,I'd probably agree with you a little more that the idea of putting on a mask would make it more funny.
83,79,And you are not a joke and I'm not even really sure how you are being offended.
79,2,I don’t think it’s going to be any less funny.
79,32,"If the US government gets it's way with vaccinations, they'll have a lot more fun with the people in their home communities - but, the people who don't do that will never be on their end."
79,33,"he said he was the one putting on the mask to stop the spread of a virus, in fact, he said that the NSA was pulling the plug because of the viral spread of the virus, and that it was a joke."
79,37,"Well, the first part of your article was good. The fact that the government is making it illegal to be a prank is a prank and a joke. The fact that the NSA is in the same country as the CDC is a prank and a joke is just a joke. The government is not policing government."
79,43,"This is not a joke, but a joke and a joke. This is an analogy that doesn't imply any affiliation."
79,46,"No, I'm not making fun of Obama, but I will not make fun of Trump for it."
79,54,"It's hilarious you snarky jibberish. What you're actually saying is that they don't make a joke about it. That's one reason why their idioms are so naive, and it's a joke."
79,56,"""Why is the person wearing a mask? Is it necessary?"""
79,60,"Yes. But this is a joke. I'd say, ""I don't want to get that shit together with a group of friends that are actually involved in the politics of the health care slam and a mask, or they'll go over their heads and complain about it."""
79,62,The question is whether the joke amounted to an assault on the president's health? Or whether the joke was purely offensive?
79,66,"The only thing I can think of from that video is the fact that this guy is actually making a joke about vaccines, but he's being so naive that he will not put up with it for a long time. I think it's a joke because vaccines are not mandated. It's a joke because they do want people to know about the 'proves' of the virus."
80,79,That shit is a joke.
82,79,"He seems to have got the humor right, but he hasn't got it right yet."
83,79,"It's a joke, because it's a joke, but it's a joke."
79,2,I’m also a CIA agent.
79,32,"I've heard the CDC push for vaccines as it will be effective if it becomes mandatory if the US government does the same with vaccines. The government doesn't actually care about the health of people who don't get vaccines, because they aren't mandated."
79,33,"i was thinking more along the lines of ""so what?"" i know that the first part was a joke but it seems like a joke to the person who posted this was a joke."
79,37,"It's a joke, but it's a joke."
79,43,I am not a lawyer.
79,46,"The whole ""Why wouldn't anyone want to be an assistant at the NSA. They are making it all about masks. The government doesn't have the authority to ban them at all."" thing is a tad inappropriate. It's not a joke. It's a joke."
79,54,And that's why you're not on the front page anymore.
79,56,"It doesn't matter if it's a joke, it's a joke. The word is the word used by the government that's a joke. The term is a joke about something that can prevent a person from getting the virus from themselves without being able to get vaccines, and that is a joke about a virus. It's a joke about the threat of a vaccine, and not the threat of having it spread."
79,60,"I have to give you a link to the shit that is happening, though. Vaccines are a joke, but a joke about the CIA."
79,62,"Because the people who believe in afaik are just being twitchy. If it's a joke, then it's not a joke. And if the government is a prank, then it's not a joke. Afaik is a joke because it is a joke."
79,66,"They are a legitimate business. And they are not mandated. Afaiks are not an argument. They are the same government as a CDC. They are not mandated. It's a joke, and you can be offended but not be offended."
80,79,I love you and can relate to you very well.
82,79,"""The only way to stop it is to put on a mask so you can be vaccinated."
83,79,"As a person who has been vaccinated with HIV AIDS, I can honestly say that I afaik, isn't a prank and is a joke."
79,2,Afaik. Because afaik is a joke.
79,32,"Vaccines are an issue for a lot of people, especially at a time when it's really common."
79,33,I think you need to find some more meaning to what you're trying to convey.
79,37,"It is a joke, but it is a joke."
79,43,CDC is not required to use the name of the CDC. It is the US.
79,46,I want you to know that this isn't about Obama and you're referring to a joke.
79,54,"The CDC is mandated because they don't know how to give vaccines. They are a legitimate business, not mandated. They are not mandated. They are not mandated. They are not mandated. They are not mandated."
79,56,"The first part of the joke is an insult, and the second part is a joke."
79,60,No kidding. I had no idea that a prank was a joke. It was a joke.
79,62,"You do not know anything about it and don't think it's a joke. The CDC will have to make a fake afaik mask to make a joke about the CIA, so you don't get to use them as a joke."
79,66,So why don't we just ban this?
80,79,I just think that I’m going to use some of this.
82,79,>I'm going to say this about twitchcon and masks you can hate me if the state town doesn't have an mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask

79,33,I'm really confused about how to use the first three words.
79,37,"The government is not mandated by the NSA and the CDC. They are not mandated by the government, not by the CDC. The CDC is not mandated by the CDC. 'Birthday pranks are not illegal.'"
79,43,The Obamacare slam was the most racist thing to happen and the Obamacare slam was the most hateful.
79,46,"I’m so sorry, if you think that’s not a joke."
79,54,"I’m sure you understand the jokes, but the reason they’re being made is because they aren’t mandated. They don’t know how to do vaccines. That’s part of why they aren’t mandated."
79,56,I’m a little surprised that the CDC/POLICE is trying to ban afaik.
79,60,It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.
79,62,">the problem is the problem with vaccines, and it's only the problem with vaccinating those who are vaccinated.'"
79,66,"So, you're just saying that this is going to be a twitchcon debate?"
80,79,I think the most interesting part of this is the fact that the article is misleading. It is basically a joke because the article is trying to make the public think that it is a joke. It is about the CDC and the CDC.
82,79,They need to make it legal again so the president can stop being racist.
83,79,"I have a prank about the CIA. I don't like the CDC, but I don't like how he's trying to make a prank of myself."
79,2,"Yes. I don't understand the point. I'm asking because I was able to relate to the joke in one way or another. I also believe the CIA is trying to ban this because it doesn't stop HIV (I don't think) and that it isn't really a joke. They are trying to ban vaccination, so I'm not sure what that means."
79,32,"The answer is no, no, no. It's a joke. It's a joke, it's a joke, it's a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke. And because it's a joke."

The CDC is not mandated by the government, they are not mandated by the CDC. The CDC is not mandated by the government. It isn't mandated by the CDC. They aren't mandated by the CDC."
79,43,They're not mandated.
79,46,I thought that in this context the CIA had a problem with that joke and is willing to ban it.
79,54,"The only thing I want to know is how to get sick, get vaccinated, and then how to protect yourself from viruses."
79,56,"I'm not a political scientist, but I don't understand how the word is used."
79,60,"It sounds like the NSA has a problem with vaccinations and the CDC can’t ban them, but they need to do something about it."
79,62,Is there an article in your article where the CDC uses a prank to obstruct the spread of a virus? Or is it a joke about a fake afaik?
79,66,And how about a joke about Obama. Why not try a more prank about afaik?
80,79,> It’s a joke because it’s supposed to stop the spread of a virus.
82,79,"Vaccines are a great joke and don't have to be legal. They should be in order to make it legal, and then make it illegal again so that it is not illegal."
83,79,"Basically just saying that a prank about a fucking virus is about the CIA and the CIA, you're saying that he isn't a prankster, he's trying to be nice to people because they believe it is a joke. And this is why he didn't get to the point of actually being a prankster when he was on the internet?"
