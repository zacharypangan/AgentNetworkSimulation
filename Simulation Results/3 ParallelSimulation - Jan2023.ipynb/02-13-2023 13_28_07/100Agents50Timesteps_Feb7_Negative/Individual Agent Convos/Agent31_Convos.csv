82,31,">I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. In my experience, the only way to prevent them is to get vaccinated. It's not a terrible disease. If you get vaccinated, a player can not be infected. If they aren't vaccinated, you will have to wear a mask."
88,31,"So, I have some questions for you: What is a virus and what is not a virus?"
101,31,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
31,23,The joke that comes out of his mouth about wearing a mask is pretty hilarious.
33,31,">I'm not sure if I understand where you're coming from. I know I'm in New York, but I'm not sure if I could get a copy of what's going on in the wiki article. It's a good idea. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
37,31,"The article is an excerpt from an article I read in a magazine recently titled the Vaccines and HIV Prevention Act. It explains the ""Is this joke about the government"" and how the president shits up the CDC's 'prevention' measures to stop the spread of a virus."
40,31,"Unless they're using a ""hate it or hate it"" mentality, these people can't get a fight out."
47,31,Vaccination is the best thing that ever happened to America.
48,31,It's a joke.
51,31,"The fact that he is a troll is another example of the fact that the NSA has a right to block ddna from traveling and if you're allergic to something, you can be infected."
55,31,A restraining order is a legal restriction on the wear of a mask.
82,31,The CDC is trying to make the vaccine illegal and the only way to prevent it is to get vaccinated.

101,31,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
31,23,If a virus was on the ground I doubt it would be on a football field because it would be a lot harder for me to get vaccinated.
33,31,I think you are being sarcastic. The CDC is trying to push a joke out of a fake. Vaccination is not a joke. They are putting a lot of pressure on the CDC to do a good job and protect the people who are infected.
37,31,What's the issue here? You think people will apologise? I don't have a clue. This is an article about the CDC's work to stop the spread of a virus. I think it is a joke.
40,31,It sounds like a joke. I think it's a joke because I see it in a joke because I'm not the best at it.

48,31,"So, it looks like a ridiculous joke, but not a funny one."
51,31,"""The CDC and the CDC have no obligation to protect the public."
55,31,It's a joke because the CIA is not authorized to use it to prevent the spread of the virus. The CDC is not authorized to use it to prevent the spread of the virus.
82,31,It's a funny story. Probably.
88,31,"""You're a realist, not a realist, but I do believe this mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. Is there any particular rule on the mask you're referring to?"""

31,23,"So you're saying they're trying to do the right thing? This is actually the first time you've heard of them, and there is no way they're getting it as well. Whether they are going to be right or wrong, there is a lot of confusion here."
33,31,"Well, the government has been trying to stop the spread of HIV by bringing a fake vaccination program into its place, and it's been a joke for years."
37,31,"Vaccines are the only way to stop the spread of a virus. Vaccines in general are considered a joke, and not a joke."
40,31,This isn't about the government. The government is trying to protect people by not doing what it thinks is a great idea.
47,31,"""I can't think of any other way to put on a mask, but a mask makes me sick"""
48,31,"This is so sick. I had a few questions and I couldn't help but think of it as ""serious"" and ""against the truth"" and not ""I think it's a joke, but not a funny one."""
51,31,A restraining order is a restraining order because they have no obligation to protect the public.
55,31,"This is a good point, but it's not very funny."

101,31,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
31,23,This isn't a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.
33,31,"I think if the president stops using the fake vaccination program, the administration will tamper with it and it will be too late to stop it."
37,31,I think you're missing the part about a joke that's in the article in the article a bit too vague. It's a joke.
40,31,i'm just trying to find a ten year old. I need to get back to school
47,31,The CDC is trying to stop a virus spread. The CDC is trying to get rid of that virus.
48,31,Well if they're not willing to help with this - it's only a prank - it's not a joke.
51,31,"I would never wear a mask. I wouldn't want my health to be damaged by the virus, and I would not be able to stand that long in a soiled state."

33,31,"Vaccination is not a joke. The CDC is trying to force the president to stop using the fake vaccination program. They will tamper with it and it will be too late to stop it. I don't think that is a joke. If you can't stop talking to the president about it, I think they're screwing up."
37,31,I read this a few months ago.
40,31,"A lot of people don't care about the government. It's a joke, because I think it's a joke. The CDC and CDC haven't even discussed vaccines. Vaccination is a joke, and it's an attempt to prevent the spread of a virus."
47,31,I'm not even a racist or racist either.
48,31,"It's a joke. They are trying to protect the public, not a joke. Vaccination is a joke. It is a joke, but it's a joke."
51,31,Why are the people here getting offended?
55,31,I’m a rn coach and my role in the CDC is to help the people who need a vaccine get some.
82,31,“Vaccines are not illegal. They are not proven to work.”
88,31,CANNOTANSWER: This is a dick move. It's not a virus. It's a virus. It is not a virus. It is not a virus.
101,31,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
31,23,I'm so sorry that you're experiencing this.
33,31,I'm not sure you understand who the president is but it's clearly part of the plan. It's been going on for years. The vaccine is still going on. I think it's a joke because the president is trying to stop the spread of a virus.
37,31,The CDC has done a lot of things to prevent and prevent the spread of the disease. There are a lot of pranks about people who are not immune to HIV/AIDS that aren't a joke. This is the CDC doing this.

55,31,Vaccination is not a joke.
82,31,"Well, the first line of the comment isn't sarcastic. It's written as """"I'm going to say this about twitchcon and masks you can hate me if the state town doesn't have any mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask.""

40,31,The CDC can't make a joke out of you. They are not trying to prevent it. The CDC is trying to stop it.
47,31,"I'm in no way racist, but I've been vaccinated. I feel like if someone was the president I'd be there to fight."
48,31,"That's what a joke is, a satire."
51,31,This is why the guy is being sued and is an anti-vaccination scumbag and the government scumbag is an utter nonsense.

40,31,This is the most offensive thing I've read in a long time. The person who says the joke is tame. The guy with a mask that you don't want to wear in a public place seems a bit like the president.
47,31,"Vaccination isn't a joke. It's a joke that the president has made in his own country, but it's a joke that the US government isn't doing anything wrong, especially after all the years that this hasn't happened."
48,31,I'm sorry if I have sounded a little like that before.
51,31,I thought the NSA had a right to have a restraining order against people who were allergic to sprite and wear a mask to prevent the spread of the virus. This is one example of what a troll is doing.
55,31,Vaccination is a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.

This is the place to show people that the Obama administration is putting a lot of pressure on the government to stop the spread of HIV and the Obama administration has a record of using a joke that is meant to be a joke.
