101,6,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
7,6,It's just because they are not going to give you the knowledge to wear a mask to a game.
15,6,"I mean, they are all gonna have a sick mask or something, but the rest of them aren't even gonna do anything about it. Is a mask an option?"
16,6,"This is so unpopular. Trump made a joke about her wearing a mask while going to TWitchcon. It's ridiculous, and doesn't even have the ability to do anything about it. This is the same thing that Hillary did with Ted Cruz."
17,6,"Basically saying you hate the team and the coaches, you hate the coach."
26,6,I like how the title states that the government can't legally require that a person to wear a mask.
43,6,I'm afraid of you.... or the people on the left who say they think this is an option.
45,6,"If a player is not wearing a mask or a helmet properly under his helmet, he should be resigned. If this is the case, he is NOT being the best coach."

62,6,I'm a guy and I wear a mask to walk my own feet. I'm on the road in a taxi with the people I'm riding in.
68,6,"The whole ""witch con is a mess"" thing is just stupid and stupid. It would be weird if there were any more laws in the U.S. about it, like ""as a vaccinated person with boosters i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask i will not go"
71,6,You've got the right question. Who wears the mask?
72,6,"if you want to change your own life or move to another country, you'll have to wear a mask. I don't think they would like to change, it's just a way to keep your family off a map."
76,6,The way the Obama administration wants you to elude me is because they want to get rid of your right to die and infect others. You just get out of it with your right to die

90,6,"People say they can walk through a restaraunt with no need for a mask and then take it off when they get to the table. They say that because they have a phobia of having a face mask, they could have a more sense of humor and a higher sense of humor than a phobia."
101,6,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
7,6,I am not a fan of the NSA and I'm not a fan of the Vaccination Act and the US Senate.
15,6,if the mask is not being worn or worn correctly then no one can go after you. it would be weird if a man was trying to smoke with a mask and if he doesn't want to wear a mask. that's a whole new thing unless you're going to ask if you're a fraud.
16,6,"I can assure you, I've been in a very very serious situation."
17,6,"i'm not going to give you any specific information, but i think this is a joke to show you what's happening in the country if you've done it. i'm gonna make a joke about the whole thing. I was in the army and i was the only person to have had to wear a mask and not wear a helmet. my team was a little tired. i was a guy who couldn't put on a mask, but in a confined environment, the helmet would go from a'shit' word"

45,6,"i m a lot of times more comfortable playing the position of the captain because i wear a mask to defend me versus the coach because i am not afraid of the consequences of a mask when i do play my role. my role is to keep me sane aplenty, and i'm more comfortable to sit slack than be in a position to help other players."
52,6,i am an official in the military and have done it multiple times. i don't think it's that hard to make sure someone can get the helmet and help get a medical card. but they have done it so far that the medical officer isn't going to look into it. they may also do it to keep the medical doctor from getting sick and not wanting to give you an explanation for their behaviours.
62,6,"If you were a human, and you'd walked in a restaraunt without being struck or beaten, I'd think you'd just be the opposite."

78,6,ah the funniest thing that happened to me i have not been to any of these events in months Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
90,6,"A mask isn't necessarily evil, just the way it's used. The government isn't trying to keep people safe because it's the way the government is trying to keep people safe. If you're going to keep being a criminal, then that's going to make you a criminal."
101,6,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
7,6,Why are people on Reddit? They don't make sense and they don't think that the public is aware of what they are doing or are able to do. It's not the government's fault.
15,6,The article says that wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. This whole thing is a scam. I don't want to be like you.
16,6,I'm not sure if it was the wrong or wrong thing to say or do.
17,6,Using the word shit to suggest you know how to prevent it?
26,6,He's probably going to have a hard time getting out of the system. You don't want to have to face a government and get an immediate response from the media or the medical profession. This sounds like the best kind of job he has.
43,6,Apparently this means the government is using a virus and not the players.
45,6,"The NFL is very well known for its stupid rules and the NSA doesn't understand why it does this. I just want you to know that if you were in charge of the NFL, that you should wear a mask and a helmet. It's a joke and not a joke if you have no knowledge of the rule."
52,6,"This is a really good one. Its not a scam, but it is a scam to get the helmet."
62,6,"I don't think anyone here knows what this is. I'm gonna sift through a list of ""i've done a lot of dumb things. I'm a guy and I wear a mask to walk my own feet. I'm on the road in a taxi with the people I'm riding in."""
68,6,I just wanted to say that the new ACA is a mess.
71,6,It's an evil lie to snoop into an innocent people and infect them.
72,6,"You know, there's one point in politics:"
76,6,And there aren't any signs that are suggesting we be out there with this guy.
78,6,I've been vaccinated and I don't wear a mask.
90,6,A common misconception that putting on a mask makes you more likely to die of it.
101,6,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
7,6,"Is it the CDC and the health care department that have a problem? If it isn't, then the vaccines are a waste of money and time. Vaccination is a waste of money. If it isn't, then the government will stop."
15,6,"My dad had a mask on when he got the flu when he was 20. I'd had it on him for almost a year and it worked for me. My brother has had his infected lungs shaved out for a year and they're getting rid of a ton of them every year, allowing him to do something about it."
16,6,... and you're talking about the government?
17,6,"As someone who has a disability and been diagnosed with a serious illness through the use of medical technology and is not currently being treated with antibiotics, this is definitely a prank. Is there anything else I can help you with to make a difference, or is it a joke that you might want to try in the future?"
26,6,It sounds like the best kind of job he has.
43,6,You're assuming that these players aren't wearing the mask?
45,6,"My guess would be that the NFL won't reactivate vaccines to prevent a serious disease, because it would ave a really bad chance of spreading a virus."
52,6,"It’s not scammed, it’s scammed to get a medical card. It’s a scam to get the medical card, and I’m sure the military does something like that for free."
62,6,I think they're all'misinformed' because they are able to enact legislation to prevent people from dying from syphilis. So they should be ashamed of what they did in high school.
68,6,That's what I read. I haven't tried to learn about the vaccines and my friends in public. I'm just an asshole.
71,6,That's an uncanny number.
72,6,"And this isn't a post about vaccinations, it's a post about the shit on twitch."
76,6,"It's not just a scam. It's a scam, and is a lot different from the other examples I've heard."
78,6,> I'm a vaccinated person and I don't wear a mask.
90,6,The only thing that people need to do is to wear a mask is to use a mask. They aren't allowing it to be worn in the US.
101,6,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
7,6,What does your mask say about wearing a mask? Do you have any idea why you are putting up with a prank?
15,6,">wearing a mask to break a tree A shit job. I'm sorry, but you're on the right track to your life. This is one of those people who seems like they've got too much power to be involved in anything. This is why we don't have the right to keep out of the house."
16,6,I feel that these people are so in the right here.
17,6,"> As someone who has a disability and been diagnosed with a serious illness through the use of medical technology and is not currently being treated with antibiotics, this is definitely a prank."
26,6,"I have a very catty cough apnea. That makes me a little drowsy. I am not trying to be a snooper, but a catty cough apnea guy is just a snooper."
43,6,They're only giving the masks to players that are actually vaccinated to stop the spread of the virus.
45,6,"The guy you were talking to is saying he was at the stadium to wear a mask, because he feels that a guy was 'out there' and was ""too nervous"" to get his helmet on."
52,6,"He’s an obstinate dick. He’s a good person, but the government can’t do anything about this. Is there anything else you can do to help him?"
62,6,"The only question is ""how do we keep it down?"""
68,6,...because you are the one who doesn't know how to be safe and why everyone else does. The one who has learned the secret to keeping away people from getting sick is a troll.
71,6,"""My mom used to smoke a lot and she had to use a mask every day. It was the most useful thing she could get in the world."""
72,6,"It's not that the media is fucking up, but they are just trying to make a joke out of what isn't the real thing."
76,6,A lot of people do not want to talk about the virus.
78,6,The CDC doesn't have a policy on what is considered acceptable behavior to be vaccinated.
90,6,There is a lot of truth in this.
101,6,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
7,6,I don't know. This is one of the few times I know that this happens. I've done it before because I can't figure out what it is.
15,6,"This isn't a big deal. There's no guarantee that a mask will not save people who are suffering from HIV/AIDS and/or HIV/AIDS. If you're not worried about it, you are going to die. You'll still get a job and you won't be able to get a vaccine."
16,6,Are you sure you aren't an agnostic lawyer? Because I am.
17,6,I'm not really a fan of the word prank. I'm just going to put it here.
26,6,"There are several stories in the wiki describing a doctor who tried to sell his daughter a snoop 'n's mask, which was apparently a fake for years. Probably because he was a scammer and he wanted to make money."
43,6,"A mask and the vaccines have to be worn on the players so that the players cannot get sick. You don't know if you need the mask to stop the spread of the virus. They are allowed to wear the masks to a medical facility, you'll just be wearing the ones that they have."
45,6,"No. Despite the fact that you are going to be in charge of the team, you are able to still be comfortable with the consequences of a mask."
52,6,"I would think that wearing a mask could be a way to prevent a certain amount of illness in those who might be sick. The mask will be used as an indicator of what's going on to spread the vaccine, and it's also a good way to prevent people from getting sick from being sick."
62,6,"Generally speaking it doesn't matter what it is. A CIA man would wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus. He would be infected if he were a human. I think there's no way the government can do that, and you should be ashamed of what you did."
68,6,It's really hard to get sick without a mask. It's like getting a little uninformed about what you should do while at work because you don't want to work and you have no idea what you are doing. It's really hard to have sex without a mask when you're sick. You just don't think you can do it for a long time. You know that it will never be that easy to shit with your own body. You know that you can do it when you want but a big deal and make a big deal because you
71,6,This is a joke. It's really bad and is very serious and VERY dangerous.
72,6,I see that this was a joke from Obama.
76,6,"You're just a stupid asshole, a person who has a right to die and will never go back to a hospital. He has to have a doctor."
78,6,"You are not a vaccinated person, and your vaccinated person is a vaccinated person, which is why the virus is spreading."
90,6,This is a huge issue.
101,6,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
7,6,You've been on the team for 7 years. This is the guy that got sick and is the guy who sucked.
15,6,Is wearing a mask a big deal? That's not what it was supposed to be about. Is it possible you'll be able to take it back to the doctor if you're not in hospital? I've not had the scarcity to actually testify or say anything like that since it's been a while since I went on a trip to the CDC.
16,6,Are you sure you aren't an agnostic lawyer? Because I am. I'm sure it's just going to end up on here.
17,6,You think we're going to get a prank about this? It's a big deal and a big deal to make up for it.
26,6,"Basically, I think the CDC, the CIA, and the government are in a position to stop anyone from wearing anything - if they have no idea - from being able to do anything about the spread of any virus or that anyone else would be able to have a serious infection, they would be doing all the work to make a ""cleaner"" environment. And yes, they are working on getting polio. It's not a scam. It is a scam."
43,6,Are they allowed to wear the masks in public? Because I'm the only one that is aware of the problem.
45,6,This would have to be the most hilarious thing I've ever heard in my entire life.
52,6,"OP, that was a prank. Not the first, it's the first."
62,6,I think the only way the government can do this is to be a dick and he should be ashamed of what he did. He was a dick and a joke.
68,6,"I've seen a couple of the headlines, and they seem to make fun of the other posts."
71,6,This is a joke. OP's not a fool.
72,6,">You know, there's one point in politics:"

This isn't a good idea and should be made clearer - because the Obama administration wants to go out on a limb over the virus. This is not the kind of thing the government wants. It's not an excuse, but just an affront. If you're"
78,6,What does being vaccinated means to you? That's a big red flag.

101,6,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
7,6,The Devil Wears a Mask is a great book. It gives some fascinating information on a few issues. It's also funny how the NSA is doing the best they can to keep the vaccines current and infected.

45,6,I'm still thinking about getting a life insurance quote.
52,6,">He's an obstinate dick. He’s a good person, but the government can’t do anything about it."
62,6,Is it a good thing? Because the problem with the CDC is putting the people in it at risk.
68,6,"If it's a joke, I'll be honest. It sounds like the only people who understand how to behave with a mask are the people who are being obnoxious, and who are trying to force their views on the ACA."
71,6,It is a snarky joke. The government is attempting to stop the spread of a virus. People who buy fake masks and get sicke are usually a little trolls.

26,6,I think a lot of people aren't aware that people who have actually been vaccinated are being the victims of this virus.
43,6,The quote is being made as a joke. The article says he has a lot of rules about wearing the masks - and what they do with them is the most accurate explanation for why the rules are in place. I think he is being a sham.

90,6,Having a mask makes you more likely to die. Putting on a mask makes you more likely to die. Wearing a mask will not stop people from dying. You need to be very careful in public. Taking a mask to the table isn't like a joke. There are a lot of people that think that putting on a mask is something that prevents people from fending for themselves.

71,6,"Its just a fake. Its just a fake. Its a joke that is made to stop people from getting sick, but not a joke. It is very strange. Vaccination is an awful disease. If the team is vaccinated, a player can not be infected. If they are not vaccinated, you will have to wear a mask. The only real solution is for a guy to wear a fake mask.

52,6,"If someone is sick and has a prank and their mask is off, they will be infected and the doctors will think a prank is going on, not the military. That's a joke and the cdc report will be ineffective."
62,6,You're just saying the NSA is trying to make people feel stupid. If he wished he was a troll or a joke they'd have a hard time going to court.
68,6,"I'm so very sorry this happened. I hope you find some answers, especially the ones I read here on reddit."
71,6,"That's really weird, because if they didn't already know about the vaccinations and want to know if there was any, that would be a fake. It's a joke."

17,6,The CDC wants the athletes to be given a vaccine. There are several problems associated with that.
26,6,Unless he got a real vaccine he isn't going to be able to get it. The government can't even prevent the spread of HIV without a good reason. He can't get a good vaccine because the CDC has taken control of it. The CDC has nothing to do with the spread of the virus. It's an effective way to prevent the spread of it.
43,6,The quote is being made as a joke. He's referencing the fact that CDC is in the process of making a ban on the helmet.

43,6,There is actually nothing illegal about wearing a mask in public.
45,6,This makes sense because it's really interesting and just one of those things that you are trying to make fun of the government.
52,6,Vaccination is not a law. It is not a law. It is a law.
62,6,">I don't think anyone here knows what this is.

76,6,Is there a way to get the virus that is not infected with a mask? Because that can be extremely dangerous. Is he being a concussion victim? Is it more to a virus that has been infected than a virus that you cannot get from people infected?
78,6,"The CDC is suing anyone that doesn't have a policy on how to be vaccinated, in order to stop the spread of a virus."
90,6,It's not just a joke. It's a troll. The joke doesn't even work and the CIA is a parasite.

43,6,Is there a specific vaccine that you believe you need to take to the CDC to get the vaccine?
45,6,"I can relate to this completely. I just want to clarify a few things. I've been in the military for 17 years and I've been in the NFL for 18 years. This isn't a joke. The only person who hasn't worn a mask and being vaccinated is me. My fiancee and I have been there with him. And I don't care what they say, they care. And I'm in the military, I'm a fan. What is my role to maintain?"
52,6,This isn't a joke. This is a joke.
62,6,This guy is a troll.
68,6,"This is a good reminder to get a helmet. If a twitchcon or a con isn't going to get a helmet and get a tv commercial, then the CDC should have the CDC provide some sort of protections. Whether or not a mask is the best way to stop the spread of a virus doesn't really matter as long as it's not one person being vaccinated. You gotta make yourself safer by using a mask, they should be able to prevent it, you're not."

72,6,"Assuming you're not in the right, I think the answer is that they want to do it, not that you do it."
76,6,The only difference is the way people think the government is trying to stop the spread of a virus and not just someone with it.
78,6,I don't think they would like to have a CDC lawsuit because it seems like they've been suing for months because of a bunch of people talking about how they think this is funny or something.
90,6,"Keeping a mask is a great way to protect yourself. Not a good joke. Unless you have some sort of allergy to it or are allergic to it, the jokes don't work because the trolls are getting used to that."

26,6,This isn't a joke. The government has a responsibility to provide health care to everyone.
43,6,Vaccination is an expensive invasive medicine that the CDC is not funding. It is the only way they can prevent the spread of the virus.
45,6,I'm not going to say that there is no way for the CDC to tell you the truth in the first place. But there is no way it can be explained in a way that makes the message clearer and more relevant.
52,6,There is an article in the CDC that says they have a “discomfort” when referring to the use of a mask to prevent the spread of HIV/VHC.
62,6,"I'm glad it's being reported, but I think you have an answer here."
68,6,"As the commenter pointed out, [Rainct.com is the place to do this.](http://www.reddit.com/r/health/r/relationships/fake-fake-virus.jpg)"
71,6,"I don't really think people are'snoopy' about the CDC, but it's a shame if a virus gets in there. It's like you 'think that it's a joke.' If they were to be snoopy about it, they would have to be snoopy about it."

15,6,"Then you could put a hammer on the lungs, and leave the guy with a little shit job."
16,6,I'm not sure what he means but this is the exact same thing as the guy who sounded like a moron in terms of the joke.
17,6,"Vaccination is the best way to stop the spread of a virus. Please wear a mask. There are a lot of things wrong with a mask, but the best way to stop the spread of a virus is to take care of it as quickly as possible, because if you don't, you can't be a troll and the CDC can't be a troll.

26,6,"If you think that the government is wrong, you should go see an AMA."
43,6,They are doing their own thing.
45,6,I can see how a person who hasn't vaccinated can be deemed a fraud in the US. I can see why this is a joke.
52,6,"He sounds like he should have just said, ""It's a joke, but it's a joke, and the government can't do anything about it."""
62,6,The CDC and the CDC are all under no obligation to help protect the public.

26,6,I think the government is going to have a hard time stopping the spread of the virus. It's a joke.
43,6,Are the vaccines safe? Because I think they're a good idea. I don't think the CDC would do the same with the masks.
45,6,I think a lot of people would like to be able to understand why they're being offended. It's a joke.
52,6,"I’d like to know if this is a joke, but I also don’t know if the whole point is if the president does."
62,6,So this troll made a good point.

71,6,"Vaccination is a horrible disease. If the team is vaccinated, a person can not be infected. If they aren't vaccinated, they will have to wear a fake mask. The only real solution to this is for a guy to wear a fake mask."
72,6,The president is a racist and not a very good person. You would think the president was very funny but you'd think it would be better if we had some kind of gov't who would actually care about the president.
76,6,The implication is that it's a scam.
78,6,I think that this is very funny.
90,6,"So I have a different perspective. What do you mean this is a joke? The joke is more about the way the government is trying to prevent the spread of a virus, the implication being a joke is completely false. A hat and a mask are a different matter."

17,6,"You don't know how to get into it, but the first sentence suggests that you just didn't want to do that, and that you can't 'wave' a vaccine. This means that when it comes to the idea of getting a vaccinated man to wear a mask and he's infected with a virus, you're not gonna ever get sick. The first sentence describes how you get sick, and it doesn't even mention the medical equipment that would go in that vaccinated man."
26,6,"I don't think we can go to the doctor for polio, and it's not possible to get a vaccine without a mask."
43,6,I'm a doctor and the vaccines are going to be a joke. It would be pretty absurd for me to have a cynical dissenter if the CDC didn't know the rules about masks.

43,6,"Vaccination is a joke and doesn't even have to be one, you should probably get a doctor's checkup or a restraining order if you have to."
45,6,"There is a joke in the US - and it's a joke, but the one that's funny is that a joke doesn't have any meaning to the 'Joke', the joke it makes."

62,6,You’re probably on the wrong side of this.
68,6,> The CDC is not supporting the ACA or allowing people to get vaccinations. The ACA is a shit joke.
71,6,"No, it's not. Vaccination is a joke. It’s a joke."
72,6,"I don't think he is the happiest politician ever, as I don't think he was a racist."
76,6,"I think we've all come to agree with you that's a troll' and we're all blaming the troll for a virus, but this seems like the most valid position that there is in the world. The truth is that we're all lying to the troll because we think the troll is trying to be a troll. We are not a troll."
78,6,"I just walked up to the doctor and told him ""that's what you think of the joke."" I'm gonna do this."
90,6,Putting on a mask would prevent people from getting HIV and they were also trying to prevent the spread of AIDS by removing them in order to prevent them from dying.
101,6,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.

16,6,“I feel that these people are so in the right here.”
17,6,I think you haven't heard of the 'The Devil Wears a Mask.'
26,6,"The CDC is not a joke, they are a program. They are not part of the ACA. The CDC has no mandate for the public exposure. It's not a ploy to stop the spread of a virus. They use it to stop the spread of the virus. They’re not meant to work to stop the spread of a virus."
43,6,"I have no idea where you were going. In my experience, most restraining orders are issued at the point that the federal government can't make you shave your head. You're allowed to go to any event without any masks or face masks at any time."

62,6,"""A guy who tried wearing a mask to stop the spread of a virus. He would be infected if he were a human."""
68,6,It's not racist to talk about the ACA but to talk about the way that people with different vaccinations are able to get vaccines from different locations.
71,6,It's a joke.
72,6,Vaccination is the best way to stop the spread of the virus.
76,6,This is the second thing I said. It isn't just about him. It is about the fact that he is a fraud or a fugitive who is looking for a job.
78,6,"Vaccines are good, but they are not recommended for people who are already getting vaccinated."
90,6,"I think this is a very good example of what a joke is. The CIA and CDC have found out the truth about the CIA's policy of keeping people in danger. It's a joke, if you will. The CIA and the CDC have found out the truth, but they don't have the authority to act if they feel they're going to do it. It's not a joke and is not offensive to some people."
101,6,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
7,6,It is a joke because of the lack of morale and social cohesion that people make during a fight or by other means. There are a lot of reasons for this to happen in the US.
15,6,I can see why people are going to get relegated to r/politics because the CDC is not doing enough work to keep people from getting sick. The CDC is trying to push the false assumption and it is one of the most egregious anti-vaccination issues that have ever been uncovered.
16,6,>Is this a popular topic or is this one the subject of more than one thread of political commentary?'
17,6,The guy mentioned that he wanted the CDC to take care of a sick person who threw the 'The Devil Wears a Mask'.

68,6,"There isn't anything you can do to prevent spreading a virus. The government should do what they want. It doesn't mean that you're not safe, and it doesn't mean that you have to do everything you can to prevent it."
71,6,"As an American who's gotten vaccinated for HIV/VHC. I believe the CIA and NSA are doing something wrong, which is why sex is illegal on our borders."
72,6,"The CDC will enforce the restraining order, and the president may ask the doctor to wear his mask for a week, but that doesn't make him a racist."
76,6,[NAME] is the CDC's assistant secretary of health
78,6,"I just found out that a bunch of people are just trying to make a point of the fact that the government isn't interested in what it's supposed to do, and I'd be much happier if people would just accept it and do the same."""

17,6,"I'd like to point out that the government isn't paying the players, they just want the vaccine to prevent the spread of the virus."
26,6,It is a joke because the president is trying to make the world a better place.
43,6,I'd consider this a joke.
45,6,"I'm a coach, and I wear my mask all the time, but my job is to keep me safe and help others."
52,6,"A prankster is a joke. 'Violence is not the only cure to a virus. If the team is vaccinated, a player can not be infected. If they aren't vaccinated, you will have to wear a mask."
62,6,"So, the CDC is trying to sue the CDC for a violation of the Constitution?"
68,6,"As a young person who grew up in a CDC office, the entire ""Fake ACA"" thing made me laugh. I was in the CDC's lab and it wasn't a joke."
71,6,Vaccination is a joke.
72,6,"I think you are really just thinking of the people who are being racist, you're an idiot."
76,6,There is a lot of stuff going on here in this whole thread. There's a whole section on this topic that includes a bunch of the things the CDC and the CDC needs to be told about.
78,6,In this case the CDC just doesn't have any idea what they're suing for. The CDC is suing the CDC and the public.
90,6,"""I don't think it's a joke. I don't think it's the most ridiculous thing to do in the world. It would be strange not to have a CIA person with me on my tour."

52,6,This is a joke. It is not a law.
62,6,This is just a joke and is being made up because you think people know what a good joke is.
68,6,"I have never seen a CDC commercial where a white guy is putting on a mask because he was sick and the whole whole thing sounds silly and trollish. It's been for years and is always coming up as stupid and obnoxious. I mean, not much of a joke. It's an ACA thing."
71,6,"If the guy who wears a fake mask is not vaccinated, he is going to lose his job. Vaccination is going to be an awful disease, because people are afraid of getting sick, and so they wear masks, like those from the movie, if they don't know about the vaccines. The fake masks don't work, because people don't know about it, because it's a joke."
72,6,This 'Fucking'comment has been abused.
76,6,Why are people talking about this? Is it an actual joke?
78,6,The CDC is suing people for trying to put a joke on them to prevent the spread of a virus.

17,6,"""What do you think is a joke?"""
26,6,I have never heard of a person who has a mask - or even even knew it existed. But I do think the fact that there is no way for the CDC to provide a shit ton of protection to people is the most absurd part of the story.
43,6,"A restraining order is not a joke, its not a joke, it's a joke. The president is saying that '... because'""...because we believe that our govt is using a virus and not the players.''"
45,6,"Is this a joke? No, they aren't."
52,6,"In your defense, the joke is about being an immature asshole. Vaccination is not a law. It is not a law. It is a joke. It is not a law."
62,6,"So, the whole point is that he is not a troll. he is trying to make people feel stupid because they are not a terrorist organization."
68,6,"A lot of the comments are pointing out that it's racist to put on a mask and not that it's necessary to wear it in a certain way. It's just a joke. It is illegal to put on a mask when you are sick, but that's the definition of a joke. It's not racist to call it a joke. It's not racist to call it a joke. It's a joke."
71,6,"Vaccination is a joke, not a joke at all, because it isn't a joke. That's why people say it's a joke."
72,6,Because the government is trying to make a joke about what isn't the real thing. They can use masks to stop a disease. It's not a joke.

52,6,This is the CDC pranking joke. There is not a joke about it. It is not a joke. It is a joke. A joke.

68,6,I'm sure if you went to the CDC there wouldn't be as many comments on the post.
71,6,"I would never buy a fake mask and I would not be able to get a fake one, especially if a guy with a fetish for tobacco uses it. The only thing that would be funny is if you wear a fake mask.

17,6,A prank is a joke. It's a joke.
26,6,There is a problem with it. A real doctor can take your HIV a virus without you knowing it existed and the CDC can give you a false one for good luck. They can take you to a ER if you don't have the right vaccine and then take the patient away.
43,6,The best way to stop the spread of the virus is to use the mask to stop the spread of the virus.
45,6,It's been a couple days since I last checked.

26,6,"I was thinking the same thing, but this guy was a snoop. The mask is an ad. That's just a way for him to make himself more comfortable and be in the CDC's hands. That's why they need to put his name in it."
43,6,I'm just assuming the comment isn't as ridiculous as the other one is.
45,6,The NFL is very well known for its stupid rules. Then it goes on to say that they are very well known for their stupid rules. Then it goes on to say that they are very well known for their stupid rules and the NSA doesn't understand why they do this.

71,6,"A person can get sick from snooping or snooping, and there are lots of people who don't get the chance to get it. So, I'm gonna start with this:"

17,6,"As someone who has a disability and is being diagnosed with a serious illness through the use of medical technology and is not currently being treated with antibiotics, this is definitely a prank."
26,6,... and the NSA has done the exact same thing.
43,6,I’m gonna go out on a limb here and say that the CDC is doing a horrible job of using them and putting people in danger from it. They’re infringing on a legitimate legitimate cause for people.
45,6,"I am not the only person who hasn't vaccinated, but I think it is hilarious and I don't even know what that means."
52,6,What is the president saying to tell the president he is not a joke?

71,6,"""Vaccination is a joke because it is effective in preventing the spread of a virus."

76,6,"It's a scam, it's a joke."
78,6,"Well, we have no evidence that this isn't a joke. I know a bunch of people who grew up without vaccinating their own children, but if you're in your early 20s, and a friend of mine is on the receiving end of this, then you are definitely not a joke at all. This is a very common thing for people to do in order to prevent the spread of a virus, so I think that's why you sabotaged your knowledge and it's not really a joke. And then the rest of the thread"

43,6,"They're only requiring a license from the US Department of Health and Human Services to do something about it, so there's something to be said about that. It's not a joke, it's a joke.
