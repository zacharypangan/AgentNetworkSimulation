99,82,"[In my book The Devil Wears Masks, the movie tells the story of the evil guy wearing a mask while he's in it."

99,94,"I don't think that's an accurate comparison. I don't believe that there is actually a full picture of what this whole whole thing is about, just the idea of using a mask is ridiculous, in my book the Devil Wears Masks, the movie tells the story of the evil guy wearing a mask while he's in it."
99,82,"IANAL. But if a book hasn't given you a full picture of how a lot of things work, it's worth a read."
99,94,This is like saying if I saw a movie I would probably just die. It would be a long time before you saw a movie. And if you see that movie you would have heard all of this.
99,82,I think this is something you're comparing two of the most effective - one of the cheapest - ways to stop the spread of a virus:
99,94,"I don't believe that there is actually a full picture of what this whole thing is about, just the idea of using a mask is ridiculous."
99,82,Is it like saying if I saw a movie I would probably just die. It would be a long time before you saw a movie. And if you see that movie you would have heard all of this.
99,94,I would like to add to this that the whole idea of having to wear a mask during the occurrence of a virus isn't a good idea when it comes to preventing the spread of a virus.
99,82,It's like saying if I saw a movie I would probably just die. It would be a long time before you saw a movie. And if you see that movie you would have heard all of this.
99,94,"A mask. A mask, a mask... I don't know, but I'm trying to figure out the underlying cause."
99,82,Is the whole idea of having to wear a mask during the occurrence of a virus really a good idea?
99,94,"The best way to prevent a virus is to do it. It's not enough to prevent a virus. The only thing that is more effective is that it has a full picture. If you're going to try to stop a virus and then not use it, you should stop using it. You don't need to spout one of the most effective ways to prevent it but rather use a mask that has a full picture, but is unable to detect a virus."
99,82,"I thought I was reading something in another language: ""Wooting a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.Little blue ones are totally useless.Even the best don't work very well.Exhale smoke while wearing a mask,any mask and you will see the leakage. It's frightening how dumb they think all of is."""
99,94,"I’m a chemist and I’ve done some experiments and have been able to do much of it. I don’t even know how to explain, nor do I know how to explain. But I’m trying to figure out why I’m wearing a mask when I get sick and I’m feeling sick and that I should wear it."
99,82,It's frightening how dumb they think all of is.
99,94,That's just the premise.
99,82,The book The Devil Wears Masks is a great read.
99,94,"IANAL. But if a book hasn't given you a full picture of what this whole thing is about, just the idea of using a mask is ridiculous.

I think that they don't know the full picture but not a full explanation. I don't think that's an accurate comparison. I think that's something you're comparing"
99,82,I don't think that's an accurate comparison. I think that's an accurate comparison.
99,94,"In a way, I'd say the premise of the book isn't quite as convincing as it sounds, but it really is. A lot of the reasons for wearing a mask, and not just for stopping the spread of a virus are entirely hypothetical."
99,82,"Then, if the author had some background information, he'd have the whole thing figured out."

99,82,"I'm not the one trying to explain that you have a different premise, but it may be a way of addressing it to a younger audience."
99,94,"It’s terrifying how dumb they think all of is. I don’t know the full picture but I know what I’m talking about, but it’s very terrifying"
99,82,"I’m very familiar with the premise of the book, so I’m not sure if I understand it correctly. I’m referring to the fact that it’s an article about people not being able to understand what a virus is, because it has a short history of being in the system. But I think it’s an important part of the narrative of the book. It’s a great read and, if I read the article correctly, I’ll be able to tell you that a lot of people don’t know what the problem is. And it doesn"
99,94,I think they’re trying to do this with the premise that is being tossed around.
99,82,"I don’t know what the problem is, but when I think it’s scary, I think the same thing."
99,94,What's your favourite book?
99,82,"I’d say the premise of the book isn’t quite as convincing as it sounds. But it’s really great. '... But if a book hasn’t given you a full picture of what this whole thing is about, just the idea of having to wear a mask when I get sick and I’m feeling sick and that I should wear it."
99,94,What is your favorite book? A great read compared to a great book about a great book?
99,82,You're not referring to the idea of having to wear a mask when you get sick. You're referring to the idea of having to wear a mask when you are sick and you're feeling sick.
99,94,"That's my favorite book, to me! I can’t even begin to understand it, and I don’t think there are many 'experts in this world’ that understand it well. I'm trying to think of a book I’m familiar with, that would explain it a lot better."
99,82,"You can't really ""know"" what a virus is, and just ""have"" to see that you're sick. ""I know a lot of people don't know what it is."""
99,94,A mask is supposed to be a way to stop the spread of a virus.It's not.
99,82,A big piece of information. And if you read it you may find that it may be inaccurate.
99,94,Is that why you do these things? Because there are some really weird things that we can do to stop people from taking care of a virus.
99,82,I am trying to figure out why I'm wearing a mask when I'm feeling sick. I don't know how.
99,94,>I am a chemist and I've done some experiments and have been able to do much of it.
99,82,> I don't think that’s an accurate comparison.
99,94,That's a funny way to go about it.
99,82,It was an unnatural way of talking about a viral infection.
99,94,"But if you read that part, you'll know that you're looking at a problem in a completely different light than I've seen elsewhere."
99,82,I was a chemist and I knew this was a problem. I was thinking about the whole thing like this.
99,94,"I can tell you that I'm not sure what the book is about. That it's a fantastic read, and that I find it hilarious that it's being written by a person with a bf."
99,82,"> '""I’m trying to figure out why I’m wearing a mask when I’m feeling sick. I don’t know how. I can’t even begin to understand it."
99,94,The point of a book is to explain what a virus is and what it doesn't.
99,82,The premise of the book is an interesting one to be honest.
99,94,The premise of the book:
99,82,'I think that they don't know the full picture but not a full explanation. I don't have a clue.
99,94,>I think that's an accurate comparison. I think that they’re trying to do this with the premise that is being tossed around.
99,82,I can't even begin to understand that!
99,94,"I don’t know, I just think it’s funny how people describe the idea of having to wear a mask when they’re sick and the idea of having to go through the pain of it."
99,82,"The book is the perfect example of how the ""sleepy people in the government's face"" thing works. I can see that as not being accurate. The author is using the book as a joke."
99,94,"OP, you’re correct, ""the whole thing is a series of people thinking that's going to help me see what's going on."
99,82,[The Devil Wears Masks](http://www.revolution.org/r/revolutionary/cba/article.aspx?page=elo_single_name=single-name) is an excellent article on how the government is to stop the spread of a virus.
99,94,"As they say a lot of the reasons for wearing a mask, that they do not believe is really that good for preventing a virus. They also say that if people stop using a mask if they are sick, they won't get sick again if they are sick."
99,82,I don’t think this is accurate. I’m not going to give you a proper explanation of the whole thing.
99,94,There's not a full picture of what a virus is. It's a series of people thinking that's going to help them see a solution to the problem. I think it's more like saying if I saw a movie I would probably just die. It'd be a long time before you saw a movie.
99,82,The whole concept of it is just a joke and you can't explain it.
99,94,“We have to wear masks and it’s a really bad idea.”
99,82,I can't even begin to understand how they're using the book as a joke.
99,94,"""I'm not sure what the book is about."
99,82,"I'm not sure I'm an idiot, but I'm going to have to say that I think the premise of the book is not accurate. ""But if a book hasn't given you a full picture of how a lot of things work, it's worth a read."""
99,94,"I read your first sentence, 'Wooting a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.Little blue ones are totally useless.Even the best don't work very well.Exhale smoke while wearing a mask,any mask and you will see the leakage."
99,82,The people who are trying to read the book and the idea of wearing a mask are too ignorant. That's an excuse to not write the book.
99,94,Using a mask to make people sick or sick.
99,82,That's a bit of a witty nitpicking to me.
99,94,"I think I have read the book. I didn’t have it in the first place, but I do know a lot about it."
99,82,Is there a 'problem' in the movie you're talking about? I think that would probably be in the first paragraph.
99,94,It's more like saying if I read the book if I was sick i would probably die. I wouldn't get sick again if I didn't. But I can tell you that I've read the book. The book is about a virus that can cause pain in people's eyes
99,82,"'[I don’t think I’m an idiot, but I’m going to have to say that I think the premise of the book is not accurate. I think that they don’t know the full picture but not a full explanation. I don’t have.’’"
99,94,">We have to wear a mask,any mask and you will see the leakage. It's frightening how dumb they think all of is."""
99,82,Is this just a bad idea or a good idea?
99,94,"The guy is wearing a mask and if you look close enough, you will see a lot of the leakage."
99,82,I think a bit of both. But I guess the comparison doesn't really sound like a good one to me.
99,94,I'm really sick and tired. I don't know what I'm doing.
99,82,"I’m not even sure what I’m talking about. I’m just not sure what I want to talk about, and how I feel for the people who think a book is a good idea, and what I want for the people who are trying to read it as a joke. But I’m thinking about it from what I’m told."
99,94,"So, you mean that people are wearing a mask and not just an imaginary mask to stop the spread of the virus?"
99,82,if you read the book you will understand a bit of what the book is about.
99,94,It sounds like the book is basically 'Two Blue Masks'.
99,82,"I just realized this at the beginning of the chapter and thought: '""It's frightening how dumb they think all of is.""..."
99,94,"I like the ""If"" part. It makes me feel that I'm at least partially comfortable in it. The idea is to look at the problem. I don't know what I'm talking about, but it feels good to be around people. I don't know what they're going to do to stop the virus from spreading, and it's going to be pretty tough to believe that a mask would be necessary to stop the spread. But I feel like I have no idea what that means. I don't know why they're trying to do it. I don't know how"
