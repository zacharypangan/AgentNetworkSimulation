21,17,I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam.
26,17,i m going to say this about twitchcon and masks you can hate me if the state town doesn t have an mandates you can t get mad that an event doesn t not sure if sd has any mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask

50,17,"Little blue ones are totally useless.Even the best don't work very well.Exhale smoke while wearing a mask,any mask and you will see the leakage. It's frightening how dumb they think all of is are."
56,17,I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam.
62,17,putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i ve ever done in my entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things

101,17,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
17,6,"Basically saying you hate the team and the coaches, you hate the coach."
17,11,"You can wear a mask in public, unless you have to."
17,14,It's not worth the shame of seeing the helmet. But to say it's not a bad idea is completely irrelevant.
17,15,"My parents were both indoctrinated, and had to wear a mask."
21,17,What if I told you about a virus? Is it a new one?
26,17,"If you need the mask, go to the CDC, they can help you do that. If you don't have it, you don't have it. If you don't, they don't help. They give you a free trial on how to wear it, but they also offer to make you wear one as well. They don't have to tell you if it works, but they can tell you if it works."
45,17,"Despite all the warnings, we are going to continue this."
50,17,Is it a good idea for you guys to have a helmet? It's the best way to stop the spread of viruses.
56,17,"The NSA and CDC have no mandates for mask wear unless the mask is used by a hospital or something. The government is trying to prevent the spread of the virus through putting on a mask and then carrying a mask on, even if you haven't worn a mask in 10 years."
62,17,"What if you threw a mask off in a restaraunt? If you can't get a full face, you can't get a full face."
68,17,You have no idea what that means.
83,17,Wearing a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i ve done in my entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i ve done in my entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask to walk ten
101,17,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
17,6,"i'm not going to give you any specific information, but i think this is a joke to show you what's happening in the country if you've done it. i'm gonna make a joke about the whole thing. I was in the army and i was the only person to have had to wear a mask and not wear a helmet. my team was a little tired. i was a guy who couldn't put on a mask, but in a confined environment, the helmet would go from a'shit' word"
17,11,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
17,14,> I can hate me if the state town doesn't have an mandates you cant get mad that an event doesn't have any mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask
17,15,What if I told you about a virus? Is it a new one?
21,17,"I think you're on to something. The government is a fraud, and you should be pretty surprised that there are people who believe that wearing a mask can help stop a virus."
26,17,"If you do that you have a free trial, but they also offer to make you wear one as well. They don't have to tell you if it works, but they can tell you if it works."
45,17,"This is the kind of stuff that's scary and scary for the NFL, when there is a huge crowd of kids going through the streets talking about a virus. It's hard to believe what people know about the world but its like, I can't see a player who can't wear a mask, is a kid, and not a guy in a mask."
50,17,"My favorite thing to do is to put on a mask and wear it to the doctor. I'm really sad, unsure of what to do, but I have seen a lot of people in this sub complain about people not wearing it, they might think it is the best idea."
56,17,There are 2 issues here: 1
62,17,People in u.s. prison have a medical obligation to wear a mask to keep a virus from spreading in your body.
68,17,The new ACA that covers the whole issue of a vaccinated person without a mask.
83,17,Wearing a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i ve done in my entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i ve done in my entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask
101,17,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
17,6,Using the word shit to suggest you know how to prevent it?
17,11,"The government is trying to prevent the spread of the virus through putting on a mask and then carrying a mask on, even if the mask is used by a hospital or something."
17,14,"> But to say it's not a bad idea is completely irrelevant."", ""> Is it a good idea for you guys to have a helmet? It's the best way to stop the spread of a virus."
17,15,"> They don't have to tell you if it works, but they can tell you if it works."
21,17,You said it because you are not going to twitchcon. It's the only way to keep from being vaccinated and is your job. It's a scam. We are talking about a scam that is made up of a bunch of people who have a problem with the government. I'm going to say this about TWitchCon and masks. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of a virus. We can't have the mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters
26,17,"Are you talking about the mask you're wearing? The masks are part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. Then if you wear them, you are being treated as the victim of the CDC's manipulation of you."
45,17,This is an excellent opportunity for the CDC to put in place legislation that is required to prevent a new viral infection in public and the NFL will have to address this.
50,17,"It's like they say they don't care about anything and they're not trying to prevent something that might cause it. But if they're not, they're not trying."
56,17,"I'm not going to tell you that it's funny, but I do understand that it's important to remember that the CDC has some pretty serious ad hominems on their people (especially the CDC and the NSA). They're trying to be a force for the public to take a back seat and that they're a bad idea to do, so they deem it a fraud."
62,17,"The government has no obligation to use this mask when it comes to HIV, so it's pretty much the same thing."
68,17,That's ridiculous and I'm just trying to be reasonable. I'm going to ask the real reason why people need a mask in their homes.
83,17,This is the definition of a prank and I find it hilarious.
101,17,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
17,6,"As someone who has a disability and been diagnosed with a serious illness through the use of medical technology and is not currently being treated with antibiotics, this is definitely a prank. Is there anything else I can help you with to make a difference, or is it a joke that you might want to try in the future?"
17,11,I can assure you that I'm not a prankster...
17,14,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
17,15,It seems like the federal government is just using people to make a prank about that.
21,17,I thought I'd be the first to ask because this was a hacked joke
26,17,The government isn't going to fuck off with you. I wouldn't like to say anything.
45,17,Vaccination is what prevents people from getting sick from a virus that can be spread all over the world.
50,17,"i would have no idea what the twitchcon meme is about. the one about ""the president doesn't want a mask on his face."""
56,17,"I'm a doctor, so I want to be able to say that while he's making a great point about it, I also think a good one to wear masks is actually better than a bad one. He's going to have to wear a mask, so he can get vaccinated."
62,17,"I think the point of a mask is to prevent the spread of a virus and to prevent a drug from being spread to people, and a mask is to help keep the virus away from people."
68,17,The new ACA doesn't cover the whole issue of a vaccinated person without a mask.
83,17,This is a great example of the government allowing people to wear masks and other things in their homes. This is the definition of a prank and I find it hilarious.
101,17,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
17,6,"> As someone who has a disability and been diagnosed with a serious illness through the use of medical technology and is not currently being treated with antibiotics, this is definitely a prank."
17,11,This is why they don't get any vaccinations. That's just their way of trying to fuck off.
17,14,"I am not sure if I am a prankster, but I am definitely a prankster."
17,15,The only thing I can think of right now is the ad hominem.
21,17,You're doing something wrong.
26,17,"The ""Fap"" is to stop the spread of a virus. A vaccinated person wearing a mask wouldn't get a sick person out. Then if you wear them, you are being treated as the victim of the CDC's manipulation of you."""
45,17,"I was just thinking about it, but the article makes a lot of naive points and I'm not sure what you're saying."
50,17,"I don't think he's a naive person, though. It doesn't really matter if it's a joke. He's an idiot."
56,17,"My dad told me on the internet, ""It's all the best that a few people will be vaccinated by the next one,"" and then one of us... ""I will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops."""
62,17,"I would not wear a mask if I was in a position where I would get beaten, even with a mask on."
68,17,They also have to get vaccines when you get infected.
83,17,"I am really not a fan of the word ""prank"". I am a fan of the phrase ""Pretty funny. I think you should get an axe to your face"". It seems like something 'the'is an anti - viral term and people do not like it and think it's funny because it is so terribly offensive."
101,17,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
17,6,I'm not really a fan of the word prank. I'm just going to put it here.
17,11,Vaccination is what prevents people from getting sick from a virus that can be spread all over the world.
17,14,This seems like the kind of joke the guy is making when he's playing a football game and he's not a big fan of the football game.
17,15,He ad hominems.
21,17,"Why don't you ask if you are a citizen or a senator to sign a form and say it, then if you are not you are a senator."
26,17,"I'd be a little skeptical about this, but the fact is that I was able to get vaccinated on the back of a bus in a rural area because of the polio virus. This is more of a crappy part of the ""vaccinated"" and if you need help you can't just call your friend a dick, or try to talk to him like a dick."
45,17,"Were you aware of the post? If you were, there is no way we could have asked for anything like that on the wiki. You need to be very careful with your posting."
50,17,"You're not a political cartoonist. You're not a citizen of the US, so you're an idiot."
56,17,"That's a lot of people, and it's easy to find what the CDC and CDC are trying to do with how they work. I'm sure you can find some good information that's going on with them, like this - and it's not about a criminal, it's about a government official promoting something against an innocent person."
62,17,"CDC nayadhihi nayadhi nayadhi, syphilis, polio."
68,17,"> I went to a game once that is what i got, Why isn't it allowed to be a mask? You know that the people in our country can get sick. They can't keep a person on their hands while they are wearing a mask. Until that time, when a guy doesn't have boosters, they can't wear a mask. It's really just not a good idea. I think I understand how r/health is coming off as. There is no good answer here."
83,17,"There are several reasons why this prank was a joke, but I am in agreement with everyone else."
101,17,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
17,6,You think we're going to get a prank about this? It's a big deal and a big deal to make up for it.
17,11,"That is not a prank, this is an offensive ploy against the health care system."
17,14,"It sounds like an awful lot of pranks to me. I can't imagine anything that makes a bad joke about you and how you can get a vaccine and that's just ridiculous. I'm sure you've noticed how bad the joke is, so I can't really give you a positive response, but there aren't many people who like to hear how awful a joke is."
17,15,"It's not an ad hominem. It's a joke, that's a joke."
21,17,"If you don't know about the CDC, don't sign up for it."
26,17,I don't think they are. They are trying to be as bad as the ACA. I think they are trying to destabilize the NSA.
45,17,What is the best you can do to keep the game in order. The CDC is actually doing a good job preventing the spread of a virus. It is not as if they are trying to save the CDC. They are very sensitive to bacterial infections.
50,17,Are you sure the CDC isn't a scammer? It's part of the CDC's mission.
56,17,"The article says it is a scam because it implies the NSA is trying to spread the virus by using a mask for their clients. In other words, the NSA is trying to defame the CDC and CDC by introducing a form of ""anti-vaccination"" nonsense."
62,17,"I'm a little concerned about what the FDA is going to suing you for, but i'm in a sense scared by how it's going to end, it's not."
68,17,"> The article is a bit misleading, but I do have to agree."
83,17,"I don't think that the afaik thing is really funny and it is a prank because it's a joke, but a joke is a joke if you really want to stop a prank that's only a joke."
101,17,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
17,6,> Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
17,11,This is a big deal for a lot of people. It is a joke.
17,14,I'm surprised that this doesn't end up on r/health. I've found that r/health seems to have been being naive enough to be interested in this one. It is interesting.
17,15,"The CDC is trying to destabilize the CDC. They are trying to stop the CDC from trying to spread viruses, so they are putting a lot of pranks on other people. I don't think they can convince everyone to vote for a government-backed CDC. I think there's a good chance there will be a lawsuit from them."
21,17,"So your friend is a doctor who is not a doctor who doesn't get the vaccines? Why are you being so critical of a prankster? You should know what a prank is, but you shouldn't be a prankster because of how you feel about your friend."
26,17,"I thought the NSA was supposed to be there because of the spread of the polio virus. But now that he's saying that, I don't think I'm even really that interested in the polio virus, and I want to make sure that his job doesn't involve that much propaganda. I'm more interested in the possibility of the CIA using fake information about polio and how it was harmed by that particular virus. I guess if the CIA and CDC tried to do the same, they would be very little pointless."
45,17,Vaccines and masks is basically an endorsement from the NFL if they can get the players to wear a mask.
50,17,"I read this as: ""Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of a virus."""
56,17,I feel so bad for the person who lost a mask to this shit
62,17,This is a great point. I think the only way the government can do this is to be a dick.
68,17,">I don't see a whole lot of the issue here. It's basically about 'too big to not have a mask', not the new ACA. Vaccination is very important and is the best way to stop a lot of the virus. If they don't have a helmet then I guess they won't want to be exposed to the virus, so the old ACA's not really that important to them. This is ridiculous, you can't vaccinate a man without having a mask."
83,17,"No, it's not a joke, it's a joke. The prank doesn't have to be that bad."
101,17,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
17,6,"It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. This isn't a joke, this is an insult."
17,11,I'm not sure what your point is here.
17,14,It is interesting. I think the only way the government can do this is to be a dick.
17,15,> You can't vaccinate a man without having a mask.
21,17,"The CDC is trying to stop the spread of a virus, it isn't a joke. It's not. Is the CDC sabotage? Because it is. They've been able to stop the spread of a virus. Is this something that has happened, even in our current system?"
26,17,The NSA has a legitimate purpose for helping the public. They want to keep the public safe. They don't.
45,17,"They're doing a good job at preventing the spread of a virus. There are CDC-backed lawsuits to be made against players who wear masks when the game is on, so I think that the CDC has a vested interest in protecting them from the threat of spreading the virus."
50,17,It's a joke.
56,17,I think this is an excellent way to avoid dealing with the people that don't want to have to wear masks. I want the mask to be worn to get rid of the fuck out of my lungs.
62,17,The NSA is not suing any CIA people who don't want to go back to their job.
68,17,"I'm from Minnesota and have seen several stories of people being vaccinated without a mask. I don't think it's really really a joke, or an anti-vaccine joke. But if it's a joke, it sounds like a ripoff and no one should even bother asking about it."
83,17,The CIA is a joke and that is why they want to ban it. Isn't it funny because the CIA wants to ban it? Is it funny because people get vaccinated? Because a lot of people know that it is a joke and not a joke?
101,17,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
17,6,I think the only way the government can do this is to be a dick.
17,11,>This is a great point. I think the only way the government can do this is to be a dick.
17,14,I didn't write it - I just wrote that because I feel it's important to keep it relevant.
17,15,"No, it's a joke, it's not."
21,17,>I don't like being allergic to viruses because I grew up with my parents who got all allergic to them because of their allergies.
26,17,>I think a lot of people aren't aware that people who have actually been vaccinated are being the victims of this virus.
45,17,I was wondering whether this is true because they are trying to prevent the spread of a virus. What happened?
50,17,"In a way, the point of a prank is not to imply that the president cant be a prankster, nor is he supposed to be a politician, but to make a joke. This is a prank. You cant laugh at a joke. You can not laugh at a joke."
56,17,I'm not the lawyer.
62,17,CANNOTANSWER is a moron. He has no business knowing what a mask looks like. The NSA is not suing anyone with any sort of public health status to wear a mask.
68,17,You know what I got from this.
83,17,I think this is a good example of how the government has been using it to stop the spread of a virus.
101,17,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
17,6,[Note that the government is suing people that don't wear helmets and don't want to go back to their job. [Review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination-Original-Factory-Reporting-Tax-I) [See /u/SJJc0f0wnsdj_0fwnst_svnn/doc/WihreHaveHaveHaveHaHffsihwscv
17,11,I am a doctor and get vaccinated. I have never seen a guy wearing a mask outside of a match. I was vaccinated in the first place but my symptoms of a serious disease that has been circulating in my body are due to me being vaccinated.
17,14,I have been vaccinated without a mask. I'm just glad that it wasn't an excuse to get vaccinated.

56,17,"I do not understand why people are upset about the CDC not doing what they're supposed to do. That is just what they're doing. Vaccination isn't a cure for a virus. If you can't see the benefits of a mask, you can't stop the spread. The point of a mask is to get rid of the virus, but not that it's what they're trying to do to prevent the spread. The whole idea that they're a scam is to stop people tripping and falling over the edge about a mask. You"
62,17,"I would be concerned if I was at a CDC meeting and I’d see if they would take me to court to find out what a mask looks like, just in case. I would want to get some advice from a doctor."

17,15,I think the issue is that I'm not a lawyer.
21,17,A doctor who is allergic to viruses is not being able to stop the spread of a virus. It's not what you were just referencing.
