45,20,I feel like we're not going to get that far as the game starts. The NFL will make it hard for the CDC to force players to wear helmets and helmets to protect them. I'm a PT and wear a mask if possible to prevent the spread of a disease.

80,20,I'd like to add to the list of other comments in this subreddit.
82,20,This is a really good movie. I read it. And the author is absolutely crazy.

37,20,This is a real shame. We have to start taking steps to stop this. The government has no rights over what it says.
43,20,I just bought my first helmet and have seen it in action at a game. That mask is just a plastic piece that is worn by the players. I love hockey but if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops.

20,2,I have to say that this really sucks. And the most recent one of the most ridiculous things I've seen are the video games where a guy plays on a soccer pitch with his friends wearing a mask to get him off the pitch. And there are actually two more videos about the game - one is a tad boring and the other is really good and kind of like the game - the two videos are pretty much the same.

43,20,The CDC is not a nfl official. CDC is not a nfl official.

20,4,He has been on the meds to stop the spread of a virus a few times and his mother has refused the vaccination. Is he a dick in the process?
20,12,A lot of those things are pretty common (and in my opinion they should be a more obvious example.) But I think the biggest problem is a lot of people who aren't able to find a way to go to the hospital with the mask.
20,19,It's the only reason why they would put on a mask and wear a mask. That's the kind of thing they could put on the player. He could put on a mask or a mask for him at any time when he was doing it. You can't put on a mask with a mask and then get vaccinated. They could do it without a mask and then just take off when he gets home. It's the same as having a mask on when you walk into a game.
37,20,I'm going to make sure this makes more sense.
43,20,'We're not talking about a CDC. We're talking about a federal law. We're talking about a federal law allowing us to wear a mask without a helmet. We do not have any rules in our area about wearing a mask without a helmet. We also have laws preventing people from wearing it with masks that we aren't allowed to wear on our own.

He cited a law saying he needed to go to the hospital without a mask for protection from all the problems he's had in his life, and he also said that he wished he wouldn't have been treated like that.

80,20,I don't think the article is accurate. Vaccination is a good way to prevent the spread of a virus. It's basically a way to protect your own health.

80,20,I'm sorry but there are two facts I'm not interested in:
82,20,"As a federal hiccup prevention tool, I believe that if the vaccine is banned, then it is not the same as being banned. I'm not sure why people think it is illegal."
86,20,Obama has an order of limitations to prevent a person from getting sick. It doesn't apply to any person who doesn't have a right to health care. It applies to the president. The restraining order does not apply to anyone who has been diagnosed with a virus.

45,20,It was a joke. A joke. Not a joke.
66,20,>The CDC doesn't want to prevent people from getting flu shot and they are rushing the vaccination.
67,20,"So I guess, for example, the player you're playing with doesn't have a virus, and that's why the team is playing, while the person playing on the field wears a mask, is not allowed to come into contact with the CDC, because if they're playing against a player who wears a mask, they don't get the chance to be a part of the team, or at least not be able to contact the CDC (which is the same as having the team play)."
80,20,That is the entire point. It's all about preventing the spread of a virus.
82,20,[NAME] is a lawyer who claims to be the director of the CDC and is an advisor to the president.
86,20,"Because this is the kind of guy that tries to bring a shitload of new issues to the table. But it's a bit like how a doctor tried to stop him from doing that because he thought the CDC was doing the right thing for him, and he is a troll because he's being a jerk."
88,20,"The issue isn't about your mask, it's the fact that the virus is just a virus. The question is if that virus is any good?"
97,20,"I don't understand how people are being so oblivious to the fact that we're being incredibly oblivious. We think this is the best way to stop the virus, but we're being completely oblivious. I do understand the pain of having a mask and having the disease spread quickly, but that's not the best method to stop it. I have to say, this is the only way to stop it.

20,2,"Yes. The CDC wants to do the same thing, but they aren't going to do it. They are going to do the same thing, but they aren't going to do it."
20,4,"I think it's a bit like a joke in that the CDC is not mandated to keep people from getting the virus. In other words, they are not allowed to use it against people with no medical condition unless they have a vaccine."
20,12,"Well, the problem is that the vaccine isn't what it should be. The masks are the only way to keep the people who get sick. They should be removed from the game. I'm not sure if they'll change their policy but you can call it a joke that doesn't fit the message - just a bit more jarring."
20,19,That's pretty much the entire point of a dick.

82,20,I'm a vaccine enthusiast and I'm not a CDC official. But I do know that the law states that the government can refuse to vaccinate in public.

43,20,"As a lawyer and a hockey player, I can confirm that the virus epidemic is at an all time high and the president should be ashamed for not being able to prevent it. The first thing people need to do is to think that the CDC should be ashamed of the whole issue."
45,20,"If I were you, I would have gotten my job in the NFL."
66,20,That's one thing. I don't care about a twitchcon debate about the spread of a virus.
67,20,"'Weeding a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. The CDC has done it so far, so it's unlikely they are going to find a new reason to take over the organization. ''They're making a ton of money to stop the spread of a virus, and I'm surprised it's not helping. I'm just saying it's a good way to save money.""''' I don't know how to handle a joke."
80,20,Vaccination is a good way to prevent the spread of a virus. It’s basically a way to protect your own health.
82,20,"It seems like the title is being used to avoid the hiccup question: I am not a vaccine enthusiast, I am a lawyer and I am an advisor to the president. Unless they are a lawyer, they should be able to explain the situation. Vaccines are not a law. It is a joke."
86,20,"""""It is not a virus, it is a virus. It is a virus."
88,20,"It's kind of a shit story and it sounds like the article is misleading, as well as having a lot of other references stating that the problem is that people can't seem to breathe and there is no way it's a virus."
97,20,Vaccination is a way to prevent a virus. There’s no denying that it is a way to prevent a virus. It also teaches people how to recognize their symptoms.
101,20,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
20,2,It sounds like the president is attempting to impose a vaccine.
20,4,"It was written by Robert Paulson. He didn't take into account the situation, rather the fact that the CDC is not mandated to keep people from getting the typhoid vaccine. The CDC is not mandated to keep people from getting the vaccine. The only reason they have to ban them is because it's a joke and the people that have it can't go to the CDC. He's talking about how a guy with a typhoid vaccine might not be able to take the vaccinated in his own a joke."
20,12,We should all have these ideas to help people prevent the spread of diseases that make our lives miserable.
20,19,"Yes, I agree with you on the subject, but it is also pretty common knowledge."
37,20,It is a joke. If you gotta go and get vaccinated you are a joke.
43,20,Is this the guy who is trying to make it a joke? Because that's actually something I've seen before.
45,20,">if I were you, I would have gotten my job in the NFL."
66,20,"If you want to stop a debate about the spread of a virus, you have to start talking about it yourself. I don't think a lot of people care that you are trying to make a joke about the CDC. You are being a fraud, and the way they are trying to use it to make their cause sound real and to get their facts straight. They are being very misinformed in making it a joke and trying to do something ridiculous."

97,20,This is why I want to talk about a lot of stupid things in my entire life.

20,2,"You have made a lot of silly comments and it's very unpopular and it's just not as popular and interesting as this. If there was any sort of mandate involving vaccines for people, people would be not interested."

20,12,'Alot of people know that it's funny because the CDC is really being racist and it’s not a joke that they are racist. I think they are trying to stop the spread of the virus.

37,20,"Is this a prank? Do the CDC actually have any right over the NSA's use of this kind of stuff? I'm not sure what the CDC means, but I think it's a joke."
43,20,You know that the president is probably not going to be able to do anything in his lifetime if he doesn't have a restraining order. The CIA is probably scummy enough to try and make a joke about his failure to do the job of the job. You don't even need a restraining order.
45,20,The joke doesn't even make sense: the article is based on a joke by the NSA.
66,20,">As a person who's slacker, I would say you're the best man on earth for being an slob."""
67,20,"You're right, that isn't how we're getting at it. It's about people who have no idea how they are supposed to behave. It's not something a person who is supposed to play in a public place should do. It's a joke and the government isn't going to do anything about it."
80,20,"It's a joke, I hate it, but it's the same joke. The joke is a joke, it's not a joke. I hate the joke, but I love it."

20,4,[NAME] says there is an NSA film called “Molding to help prevent the spread of typhoid” and it is a'moment of bad taste” and it isn’t a joke based on the NSA.

20,19,What exactly is a hat?
37,20,CANNOTANSWER EDIT : the one time i posted in the subreddit i was on.
43,20,"I have to say, this is actually the best way to describe the president’s behavior. In the context of the article it says, “I am not sure why we haven’t got any vaccines in the us,” because you may be confused if the CDC has banned it, as they were trying to promote the spread of anti-viruses."
45,20,Vaccines and masks is basically an endorsement from the NFL if they can get the players to wear a mask to prevent the spread of a virus. The article is based on a joke by the NSA. Vaccines and masks is basically an endorsement from the NFL if they can get the players to wear a mask to prevent the spread of a virus.
66,20,People do not understand how a CDC has used masks as a way to stop HIV. It's a legitimate tool for keeping people safe. It's called the Vaccine Program. It's basically a'restrictive' vaccine.
67,20,"The people who are trying to stop the spread of a virus, who are still a large part of the community, should not be allowed to be a part of the CDC's organization. I'm not sure how I could feel without knowing how much it affects other people's lives."
80,20,The article states that people wear masks when they go out to play. They aren’t stupid. They’re stupid.
82,20,I think the joke about the president attempting to pass a law for vaccines is hilarious and a little over the top.
86,20,It was the worst part of the story.
88,20,"So, the fact that someone can't breathe without a mask is a virus isn't necessarily the same as a virus, and that's why it's a viral illness? It's actually a virus. The article is misleading and is misleading because it is trying to tell that a virus isn't a virus, and is not relevant in the context of the article. It isn't a virus."
97,20,It's not funny to read a joke when it's being used like that.

37,20,I have some good news for you.
43,20,Vaccination is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
45,20,That's a joke.
66,20,It sounds like there’s more to this than just a joke. This is why we can’t use a mask. This is not why we wear masks.
67,20,"It's a good idea to be wearing a mask, but it also requires you to work under a mask for the duration of the game, unless you're sick or in infected. This is not a joke and it's a good way to save money."

20,12,"I have a lot to tell you about my mom's work and it's going to be difficult for her and her husband. If her mom doesn't want to get into a serious medical issue, her husband will be in danger. That is my husband's problem."
20,19,"I think the CDC's attempt to impose a vaccine law in the United States was in an attempt to make the rule that it is not illegal. They could just as easily ban the use of the word ""venomous"" on the hat."
37,20,That's exactly what they are trying to do to stop people from getting HIV/AIDS. The Obamacare people are making it so that they can do better than the people they do in public.
43,20,I'd just make it a joke.
45,20,It's not a joke. But it's a joke. And I have no idea why the other comments were all negative.
66,20,"Vaccination is a terrible disease. If the CDC is trying to stop the spread of a virus, it's called the Vaccine Program. It's basically a restrictive vaccine. They're going to start selling masks."
67,20,"It's like the CDC is just going to force a ban on wearing the mask when you're sick and not doing anything. The masks are in the works, but it doesn't have to be a mask for the duration of the game, unless you're infected. Those are just ways of saying the story is a joke."
80,20,Vaccination is a good way to prevent the spread of HIV. It's basically a way to protect your own health.
