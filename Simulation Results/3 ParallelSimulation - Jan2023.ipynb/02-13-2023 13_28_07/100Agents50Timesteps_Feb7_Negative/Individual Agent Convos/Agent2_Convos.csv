56,2,i lost my mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam.
72,2,I'm actually not sure if that's a real question but I am confused as to why some people feel this way.

79,2,I am an adult and would be embarrassed to resign.
80,2,"This is pretty standard here, they don't wear a mask. It's just that they're a huge joke to be able to do so. You just need to wear a mask and see that it's a big part of the game, and your players won't resign unless you want to play against them or if you want a good helmet."
83,2,"I had a ten foot walk through a restaraunt and then taken it off when I got to my table... It sounded funny. I didn't even realize a ten foot walk through a restaraunt even mattered for a minute, that was a total mess."

33,2,I have a copy of the text from Wikipedia. The problem is that it's a fake.
43,2,It is a scam to be afraid to go to the NSA to get you vaccinated.
56,2,That was a scam. It's like the fucking guy that says he gets into trouble with the government by wearing a mask.
72,2,"The CDC has the authority to tell me whether people need to wear a mask to prevent the spread of viruses, or to not wear masks because of health or safety concerns. In my country, it's pretty sexist to allow people to wear masks to prevent them from putting on any kind of medical equipment."

79,2,The question was: Is a helmet safe?
80,2,I'm a coach at an ice hockey club in NYC and I can tell you this. My teammate had this happened a few years back. When I was going out to play against the team I was scared to see who was in the game and I had to ask for help finding a mask. I was in a coma. My dick felt shit. It was funny.

22,2,">I lost my mask because I lose my face when I got to work. I lost my mask four times in four days - and the virus has not returned yet. Oh man... I don't think this makes much sense. It's really bad that the government has a mandate to put on masks, as well as trying to be more honest with the world, since they believe that they are being used to stop the spread of a virus.

I think if I wore a mask I would have gotten caught, but I wouldn't be able to risk the health of the players if I didn't. If my masks don't work I would probably be able to get them back."
56,2,It's a scam. You can get to jail without a mask. You're a scumbag. Go see a policologist and tell them your family is in a very dark place.
72,2,"Vaccines are a common problem here in the US, you can't get a good enough dose."
76,2,"Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. She needs a mask to protect herself from this blatant assault / assault attempt. It’s kind of a misnomer, but Maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that oh you dont like wearing a mask"
79,2,We don't have a right to wear a mask. It's in the constitution.
80,2,">[Of course I'm not interested in the repercussions of what I've done. But the fact that you're not even interested in the repercussions of what I've done.

13,2,"I'm not a racist, but if you were a kid and thought they were making fun of the NSA, you'd be dead wrong."
20,2,I have to say that this really sucks. And the most recent one of the most ridiculous things I've seen are the video games where a guy plays on a soccer pitch with his friends wearing a mask to get him off the pitch. And there are actually two more videos about the game - one is a tad boring and the other is really good and kind of like the game - the two videos are pretty much the same.
21,2,"I'm going to put the mask on at TWitchCon and show that there is nothing illegal about the masks being worn. The masks aren't illegal in most places, as I'm just pointing out."

You can read the article to find that the CDC is the real problem. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. What does the word ""scars"" mean? She is a very nice woman, very smart and really nice."
33,2,I would be very sad to be a hivemind if someone were to ask me what I'd feel like I'd wear a mask when I was 14 and this was about my face getting infected when I was 18.
43,2,Vaccination is a way to stop the spread of a virus.
56,2,"I've been asked about it in a previous comment... I don't have a job, and I'm a cop. I have a job. I work from home, and I don't do work, and I want to be able to walk around the country and see the world in person when I need it."

76,2,"It is in our power, to not eat in the same way it is in ours."
79,2,Isn't it safe to not wear a mask? Because it's the only way to protect you from infections. It's a fucking joke that a few people are still sneezing at when they rant about the health care slam on Trump.
80,2,Vaccination is a good way to prevent the spread of the virus. It's basically a way to protect your own health.
83,2,You might want to consider going to a doctor and getting tested.
85,2,"I can't believe he is a jackass because his mask is a gift for his family to keep. I'm not sure why he thinks they will get it, but my mom said ""I'm sure you're going to find it difficult to find one that won't help you if you don't know how to use it properly."""
90,2,"Why would the FDA need to ban wearing a mask to protect those who use a mask? I would just kill them for the rest of their lives, or worse, I would end up getting a fatal infection in their eyes that I didn't know, and I wouldn't want them to die and die. Is it illegal to do that?"
101,2,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
13,2,You might be able to explain some of the arguments here to OP and other users.
20,2,I think the most ridiculous thing is that they have to find a way to prevent and treat the disease. He's on the other side of the spectrum.
21,2,I don't know how many Americans have been diagnosed with arachnovirus and I wonder what they are doing with them? Is the vaccine still available?
22,2,"I mean, a mask and a helmet are two different things. I had to change my mask because my mother's dm's were still in her pockets for a bit, but I went back home and bought a new one."
25,2,That's not what a fad would be. It is the fad and we are in this in a different direction. We just gotta be faggots and faggots and not faggots.
28,2,"I think this is the joke. I'm not a doctor, but I believe that wearing a mask on your neck can help prevent infections of some kind. A mask on your neck can also prevent infections of some kinds."
33,2,> I think what I'm doing is wrong. It seems like they don't know what to say and are just trying to convince the audience that something is wrong.
43,2,I don't think this is actually a question that can be answered.
56,2,"A bit misleading, but the article does address the fact that the virus is actually actually very common in the US. It's a good way to protect yourself."
72,2,People need to be aware of the dangers of the hivemind.
76,2,I'm gonna go out on a limb and say this. The first paragraph is a bad choice for me. I think this person should be in the medical community.
79,2,I like afaik.
80,2,I don't think it's illegal to have masks. I don't think it's illegal to have any kind of vaccine.
83,2,"i'm a guy who was just being nice when people started using it. i've always wondered how it would be funny to ask them to do it, and how that's possible since it would have been a good prank."
85,2,"""... I know that the thing is that they are not cheap and I don't understand why they can't buy it, but I'm pretty sure it's cheap enough."""
90,2,It's not illegal to put on a mask in public. They don't get the same kind of protection as a medical mask. They're more concerned about removing the symptoms of the virus in the face of public scrutiny than preventing it.
101,2,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.

56,2,"It's very common. The CDC is also trying to protect people from other infections, including HIV/AIDS, because a lot of people are infected."

Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks. I'm gonna go out on a limb and say this. The first paragraph is a bad choice for me.

13,2,"As others have said, the NSA is a terrible organisation, but their restraining order is a bit of a naivete."
20,2,Wearing a mask is a part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
21,2,You can't 'do that' by wearing a mask.' I'm gonna say:
22,2,I don't know what the fuck is up with this one. The CDC is the one that is trying to stop a virus from spreading. The CDC is the one that is trying to stop the spread of the virus.

28,2,It sounds like they are making a big deal out of a crappy article.
33,2,"[I think the idea of wearing a mask because the person you aren't being a fraudster is a scam. It is a scam, and it isn't a legitimate reason to use it."
43,2,Isn't that exactly the issue the CDC is trying to fix?
56,2,"CANNOTANSWER: Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.The Obama administration did not put a mandate on people to wear masks at any point. It is in the Constitution that people can legally use a mask at any time without having to wear it, or to put a ban on it unless the law says otherwise. I've only read that one ten times, and I'm not sure if he'd disagree with Obama or not."
72,2,"The CDC has the authority to tell me whether people need to wear a mask to prevent the spread of viruses, or to not wear masks because of health or safety concerns."
76,2,"The article says the 'problem here isn't the mask. It's the restraining order that she's wearing. ""The problem here isn't the mask. It's the restraining order that she's wearing. 'Ah yes, shit. I think it's funny because this is the kind of stuff that we're seeing all the time. There's a point in everything we're seeing - all the 'invasions'. It's pretty cool when they're real, and the hugs"
79,2,Is it really a joke? It's just a joke.
80,2,"I mean, what do you mean by being a doctor?"
83,2,">I'm a guy who was just being nice when people started using it. I've always wondered how it would be funny to ask them to do it, and how that would have been a good prank. I think if the government allowed this, it would have stopped a lot of people from doing it, because it would be a waste of time and money to do it."
85,2,"... and now I just don't understand how they can have a person that can't read a book or use their computer properly? I mean, this is a lot of stuff. A good example of how people can read their own personal life, and then make money off of it. It's the CDC and a movie."
90,2,I think it's fair to say that the FDA isn't necessary to prevent a spread of a virus in order to protect civilians.
101,2,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
13,2,People who don't wear a mask are not aware of the fact that they are NSA. They are using the NSA as a means to protect the public and thus provide a safety net for people who are not a health professional.
20,2,"It's also not a joke. Vaccines are actually an endorsement from the NFL. So if you don't want to be a fan of the guy and think it's a joke, they're not going to do that."
21,2,I'm not even familiar with this.
22,2,A bunch of people aren't aware of this. That's why they want to do it themselves.
25,2,You are being a dick. You are not a politician. Its your right to be uncomfortable and uncomfortable. The CDC is not going to change. That is not why we are doing it.
28,2,I think it's a joke. This is what the headline says.
33,2,So you have been talking about getting your mask removed after a few days and it seems to me like the CDC would be just as willing to take advantage of it. So there is no evidence for this.
43,2,"I don't think that's an issue in the slightest. Vaccination, as you said, is not illegal."
56,2,That's exactly what we're talking about.
72,2,"I think the first paragraph is a little harsh. I think this person should be in the medical community. A lot of people do not want to talk about the virus. You're just a stupid asshole, a person who has a right to die and will never go back to a hospital. He has to have a doctor...and you’re not doing anything wrong, just something to do. I'm going to go out on a limb and say this. The first sentence is a little harsh."
76,2,"A federal government would be able to have people cured by not wearing a mask and not only do they not require someone to get them tested, but will even be able to see him."
79,2,...and he's not being a dick?
80,2,"I do not understand why people are making that sort of statements about the health benefits of vaccines, but the fact that the CDC has a lot of business, not just a good job."
83,2,"That's what I'm saying. It's a joke, a prank, a joke. It's a joke. This is what a joke is."
85,2,It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
90,2,"This is a really good, interesting joke."
101,2,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
13,2,The NSA does NOT use the NSA to protect the public because it is not a legitimate threat.
20,2,It's not an endorsement from the NFL. They have no rights in how it is to prevent those who get sick.
21,2,CANNOTANSWER is a fan of the Bush Administration. The problem is that people think it's ridiculous for people to wear a mask to fend off their illnesses in order to stop a virus. I'm allergic to fucking the s about the s
22,2,...but I'm not certain if that's the right thing to do? What is the actual reason?
25,2,That's why the president is a narcissist. I don't want to be in a shitstorm about anything. I want to be a bad person.
28,2,I think the only way a doctor could try to restraining her from wearing a mask is if they had to do a check on her. That would take a great deal of courage.
33,2,"""I think what I'm doing is wrong. It seems like they don't know what to say and are just trying to convince the audience that something is wrong."""
43,2,I think the article is a joke. It's the reason you see a lot of afaiks on this sub.
56,2,I'd just tell your family to go to a doctor and tell them that you're scared of the government.
72,2,"If you go to twitchcon without a mask and have a dick, you're gonna be a troll if you're not going to have a dick."
76,2,A restraining order was a restraining order and it wasn't for her to be vaccinated for any reason other than the health or safety reasons to get cured. Having a mask was the only way to stop the spread of the virus.
79,2,The government needs to stop spreading the disease.
80,2,"You’re not wrong. I don’t really think you’re wrong, but I think you’re right. That’s a joke."
83,2,"This is the first and only time I've seen an article like this in a 'post'. I think you know this because it's so silly. People with the virus don't want to put on a mask. It's a prank, it's a joke. The government banned it, and they're the only one to allow people to fend for themselves. What's a prankster to think you're a prankster? Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop"
85,2,"I read a book based on a book and found it extremely helpful, though I have to admit that this whole thing makes me sad."
90,2,It's not an anti-virus joke.
101,2,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.

72,2,Vaccinating is the only way to prevent the spread of the virus. If someone had to choose between a CDC or the CDC. If someone had to choose between a CDC or the CDC. If someone had to choose between a CDC or the CDC. If someone had to choose between a CDC or the CDC.
76,2,"""At a certain point it is impossible to detect a vaccine that hasn't been administered, and you should probably not be able to tell if a person is infected because she is a troll, or is simply a troll, or is simply trying to avoid getting a restraining order, or is trying to show her that a government restraining order isn't a virus. It's just a virus. The government isn't doing anything wrong, but it isn't a troll"
79,2,I can relate to that joke.
80,2,"Well I think it’s a joke, or at least a joke. What is it about. Is that a joke? No."
83,2,...and in which case a prank was a joke?
85,2,">I just don't see how they can have a person who can't read a book because he has a very different type of mask than me. The entire book is one of those ""the most important pieces of sarcasm of the whole thing is the one about what kind of person wears the mask. They have to get it right, they have to get it right. They would have to have an adult with a disability to read the book. I guess he is trying to make a movie."
90,2,"No, I think it's a joke."
101,2,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
13,2,They are being racist because they are going to have to cut ties with the NSA to do so. The government can't make a joke and are not trying to protect the public.
20,2,I don't understand why there are so many racist comments in this sub.
21,2,"This a lot. I’ve been around people with flus, and the only thing i’m going to change is to stop wearing masks."
22,2,"This is the CDC's job, not yours. They are trying to avenge the spread of a virus. You have a right to be offended by it."
25,2,"Ingraham is a lawyer and has not written a law in the past. The president does not do a lot of stuff on his behalf, so I’ll quote him, and leave the rest to him, which is a different matter altogether."
28,2,I believe they are trying to make a joke out of something crappy.
33,2,"A lot of people get confused, they are being clingy and have a hard time explaining this to me. Basically, they were talking about how Obama is a terrible person, and he's going to get the joke he's trying to justify it. I would think that it's just a joke."
43,2,I'm not really sure what a joke actually means but I believe a lot of people are aware of a lot of syphilis.
56,2,I'd have to say that unless I contacted you directly I would not be able to contact you in person because of the NSA.
72,2,I think the joke is that the CDC is using a mask to prevent spread of the virus. But they should not do that.
76,2,Vaccination is the only solution. I think he means it's better than a restraining order (the restraining order is the one that protects the person who threw the restraining order).
79,2,"In terms of a prank, the first phrase is ""Afaik."" It's a joke about the CIA."
80,2,"There is no such thing as a joke. It’s a joke. It’s a joke. Unless you have an insurance that doesn’t cover your medical expenses, you don’t have any right to wear a mask."
83,2,"In the case of the CIA/CIA article, it was ""a joke because a prank was a joke."""
85,2,"I can understand the book, but I can't understand why he's trying to make a movie about it."
90,2,"I am a big fan of the jokes, but this is a lot like how I've just seen a lot of funny jokes."
101,2,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
13,2,"This seems like an excellent idea but it's a little misleading and naive. It's like they're trying to make a joke to make a joke about a joke about the government and not a joke about the CDC, so they're just trying to hide the fact that the CDC is trying to prevent the spread of the virus. It's a joke because it prevents the spread of the virus."
20,2,It sounds like the president is attempting to impose a vaccine.
21,2,"So, in order for a prank to be true, you have to wear a mask?"
22,2,Why do I think these people were doing this? I think this is the best way to stop a virus. I think this is a joke. It is the best way to stop it. Its a joke. Vaccination is the best way to stop the spread of a virus.
25,2,That's not the best place to begin.
28,2,"As soon as I saw the article, I found out it had been used in a similar way to the article that's quoted."
33,2,"Yes, I do. The CDC has done a lot of damage to the public, not only to the masks, but also to the security at WTC. They have also relegated responsibility for the virus to government personnel and for the people exposing themselves to it."
43,2,"They're making people sick by saying that the vaccines are too much of a joke. They are calling it ""the most important thing you need to take seriously in your health care."""
56,2,"I think this is just a joke. Using a mask, the government will not protect you, and they have to do it with a mask."
72,2,I don't even have a comma for that.
76,2,I think it's very sarcastic that he's trying to force himself to put on a mask to stop an uncontrolled spread of a virus.
79,2,"The first three phrases are: afaik (the name for a joke) and the second one is: ""I don't care about the CDC - they don't even have the authority to ban it"", ""they need to ban it,"" ""I'm not a fan of the word prank."""
80,2,I’m a doctor and the CDC is not a joke. It’s a joke.
83,2,Because a joke is a joke because it is a joke.
85,2,"I don't think the CDC or the media are supposed to be any help at this point, as they've done so well with sarcastic comments like this."
90,2,CIA trying to stop the spread of HIV.
101,2,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
13,2,You gotta be smart. The CDC is trying to prevent HIV/AIDS. They are putting together a campaign to fuck it up.
20,2,"You have made a lot of silly comments and it's very unpopular and it's just not as popular and interesting as this. If there was any sort of mandate involving vaccines for people, people would be not interested."
21,2,It's the most obvious.
22,2,My favorite part of the joke is that it doesn't make sense and it's not about your face.
25,2,"I don't know if I'll ever be able to speak to people who wear a mask, but I can get on the front page of r/politics if they feel like they're being a dick or not."
28,2,"It's not funny, it's a joke."
33,2,"I'm assuming he's talking about the CDC, not the people in charge of vaccination and health, and the health care system."
43,2,Afaik is not a joke. Afaik is a joke. He's a joke.
56,2,"No, this isn't a joke. This is a joke."
72,2,"Vaccination is not a joke, but they're attempting to make people who aren't infected safe to die or not die immune to the virus."
76,2,I think it's important to state that the article makes it seem like this is the best sarcastic comment in the entire article. I'm saying it's funny because it's a joke.
79,2,"""I don't care about the CDC"""
80,2,"This guy jumped to the conclusion that a person who doesn't actually want to have a medical problem, but does want a medical problem, and a medical issue isn't a joke, it's a joke. I think he's being quite honest. I just hope that there is an exception to the ""whole point"" that you're making a joke in, and not just some twisted way of putting it."
83,2,"I'm a bit tired of this sub, but I do want to say:"
85,2,"He ain't going to do this, but he has to write a book about a guy who was beaten with a cigarette lighter... so, he could do this. And he's doing that, not because he's a jackass."
90,2,"I mean - you can't just be a joke, you just have to get around people. I mean, it's not like you're making it up as a joke. That's not how the CIA operates, it's that they are trying to stop people from getting AIDS."
101,2,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
13,2,"And a lot of it is ""the CDC is not the government"" and has to protect people from this and so is it a joke?"
20,2,"I'm just going to throw in my mind that the article is racist because the CDC, if they want to force a vaccine law for people, it should have at least done so by now."
21,2,I don't think the CDC is going to have any repercussions beyond a few days.
22,2,People in the US are blaming themselves for the vaccine joke.
25,2,I can't think of any of them...
28,2,"I have heard the whole issue and it makes sense that it could be a joke. If a doctor is saying something like, ""It's not funny, it's a joke."" That would just be a joke."
33,2,"As far as the CDC knows, that is not the place to start a fad. If you do want to be sarcastic, go to a medical school and ask them about it. It is a joke."
43,2,"""The CDC is trying to prove that they're being racist and that they should put in place a legal safeguard."""
56,2,I was just thinking that because we're talking about something that would be a joke to a lot of people.
72,2,"In a country where people wear masks as a way to prevent spread of a virus, I would say this isn't a joke."
76,2,So she has the vaccine but she cannot go out without it. Vaccination is the only way to stop the spread of a virus.
79,2,"People aren't always offended by jokes - when a prank is made about a government or organization a joke is taken out of context, and a funny and funny one. It's funny, but it's not a joke."
80,2,"It's all a joke, the difference is that that's what the commenters in the article say."
83,2,That’s an amazing concept. It’s like this: You’re talking about how this is a joke about a man trying to stop people from getting a virus. It’s a joke. This is the kind of joke that I don’t want to hear.
85,2,This is not a sarcastic article. You are not arguing with the author and your comment is not going to get any of their credibility. The CDC and the media need to be a little bit more clear as to what is said.
90,2,"Afaik I just started playing on a friend's group of friends, and one of them said, ""Hey, I am trying to help you."" If you are worried about getting it, tell your GP. If you don't want to die, go to a GP or a physician. Then you need a PT. They will get sick and hurt you or your doctor and get it off. I'm not sure why they would want to be afraid of being in contact with a troll."
101,2,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
13,2,> Vaccination is an important part of the health system. There's no shady joke he's making. They have a lot of authority. I think you're just the one that's going to be doing it.
20,2,"""I think the most ridiculous thing is that they have to find a way to prevent and treat the disease. He's on the other side of the spectrum."""
21,2,"I'm going to look for a pair of masks, the ones with the “disabled” names and the ones with the “disadvantage” of being on the team."
22,2,If you want to get a lawyer...
25,2,"""There is nothing illegal about the government having to use the word smoke"" to describe all the people who are vaccinated in public. ""There is nothing illegal about the government having to use the word smoke"" to describe all the people who are vaccinated in public.'"
28,2,"""A restraining order in a public health facility if you want."
33,2,"Are you sure that the CDC isn't doing anything? If not, then it's a prank."
43,2,I think you are getting a lot of cynicism here.
56,2,This is a really great joke. I really love the jokes.
72,2,The CDC doesn't have the authority to enforce health care laws.
76,2,I’m not going to come back and change anything about the first sentence. I’m just saying:
79,2,This is a joke! Is that all this is?
80,2,"So that means you have a good feeling, a better feeling, but don't make a joke, and it's still a joke."
83,2,"You're not the one that is going to be able to tell if it's a joke. I'm not sure you've gotten the full meaning of ""prank"". I mean, ""prank"" is not meant to be a joke because it's not the joke, but just that it's a joke."
85,2,I'd rather a movie than a book because of how I read a book
90,2,They're actually putting on a mask to stop people getting the AIDS. The CDC and the CDC have been doing the same.
101,2,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
13,2,I would say the CDC has a lot of authority to get vaccines to the public if it were a joke.
20,2,"In a nutshell, the article is being twisted to show how a woman is wearing a mask for the purpose of preventing HIV from spreading to her face."
21,2,It's pretty much a joke because the CDC doesn't care what it is trying to stop the spread of the virus. And it's not actually a prank because of the NSA and a bunch of other things.
22,2,"A good prank is to give someone the impression that the president is racist. That's not what a joke is. That's just how a prank comes across, whether it's true or not. If I wanted to call this a joke, I would get a lawyer and sue the president."
25,2,"""I feel like you've been very wrong on many levels. The way you are reacting now is quite fucked up and not a good place to begin."""
28,2,"The President hasn't even been able to actually make a joke about what they want to do. He's just saying, ""I'm just so scared that I can't tell you how much I care about you and your life. What you're saying is so ridiculous."""
33,2,">The joke is that in order to keep people safe, people must wear a mask. In fact, the president has to wear a mask to prevent the spread of the virus. In fact, the president has to wear it a lot more often than he can and that's the joke."
43,2,What about the people that wear masks to stop the spread of a virus?
56,2,"This is so funny, the entire point of the article is to distract the audience."
72,2,The CDC wants to give it more money than anyone else. It's a joke and it's a joke.
76,2,"It isn't a legitimately effective method. If she is a troll and has no need for any kind of protective clothing, she could get a troll and will do so for no reason. And this isn't one of the things that the government is trying to do but it isn't a real thing."
79,2,"You're not going to be funny by it's name', isn't it?"
80,2,"In a way, it's only a joke. It's a joke because they're talking about a medical issue."
83,2,It is a joke because it is.
85,2,My 'little blue ones are totally useless.Even the best don't work very well. It's frightening how dumb they think all of is. Little blue ones are totally useless.
90,2,"It's a joke, not an anti-virus joke."
101,2,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
13,2,"You know, the CDC is a joke. That's a little misleading and naive."
20,2,"The issue in this thread isn't what the article is about, it's what you're asking about."
21,2,So how would you want to be on the side of a white supremacist and the CIA to enforce the federal mandate that he wears a mask?
22,2,"In my opinion, this is a really good reason to be sick. The first thing that comes to mind is the fact that people in the US don't get vaccinated."
25,2,"I would be so ashamed of myself. I feel like this guy's comment was really, really silly. He's a terrible person. He needs to get the ball rolling and do his part to get people to understand what he's saying. He's not in a good place to begin with but I am sure he can say he knows what he's saying and why people don't do it in public. His comment was a joke."
28,2,Vaccination is not a joke.
33,2,“I think what I’m doing is wrong. It seems like they don’t know what to say and are just trying to convince the audience that something is wrong.”
43,2,"It seems that if the article is not being made up by a troll, he has nothing to say but it's a joke. It's not a joke."
56,2,"This is a joke. The government doesn't have the power to prevent AIDS, but they have to do it if a person gets infected."
72,2,"In my country, wearing masks to prevent the spread of viruses is a joke."
76,2,"As I understand it, the restraining order is meant to prevent people from getting sick and dying, but the CDC is attempting to put a stop to the spread of the virus."
79,2,"I'm actually going to be using the term afaik for a while and it doesn't seem like it would have happened without the axe, but I'm pretty sure that you're right. I think it is a joke because it's about the CIA. Regardless, if he's an afaik he can prank people with his axe."
80,2,"I mean, is that true? Is it even a joke?"
83,2,"Because people want to know if the virus is a joke, and the CIA wants to know if the sex is a joke, and therefore they're the ones who decide to go after them. If they're just kidding, then you're a joke."
85,2,"I don't think you understand the point, but it sounds to me like it was written by a person in Australia."
90,2,a hat is one of the simplest methods to prevent the spread of a virus. It is one of the simplest methods to prevent the spread of the virus.
101,2,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
13,2,"It's not a joke, it's a joke."
20,2,"In my experience, the CDC is a legitimate public authority. The CDC is a big 'bang' in the US, as people who don't understand the ""intent"" of a vaccine as well as the ability to use the vaccine as a 'bad thing' are going to just ignore it in their agenda."
21,2,"The ""Potentially Racist"" guy sounds like he could get away with it."
22,2,"The CDC has been trying to sabotage the president's attempts to put a prank on them for a long time, but the current administration is blaming them and the government for not vaccinating people, and making it a joke. It's not a joke."
25,2,He's not going to make a big deal of this at this point.
28,2,"If this guy actually got a job at a CDC, he would be called out for wearing a hat."
33,2,"There are a few things going on here. The first one is very specific. It seems like the idea is to make people think the President is doing the right thing by protecting them from the virus, which is very obvious. However, it seems that the president would be uncomfortable talking about what he is doing. The other one is that the CDC is providing vaccines and is trying to force a joke on the people who wear them."
43,2,I just wanted to put it this way.
56,2,The only thing that's been happening since the CDC's inception is a joke.
72,2,"""We need the people with masks to go vaccinating and stop the spread of AIDS. Because I do not want to live my life in fear of disease if this is true."""
76,2,"What the guy's trying to do is take a chance on the white house. The white house is trying to put the president on the back burner and it is trying to make the people happy. Regardless of what he says, the White House has the best option."
79,2,"It was an absolute joke that was made out of sheer wit and not from an official perspective, and it was a prank."
80,2,"The CDC doesn't want to use the vaccination system for a medical issue, but is currently using it in ways that are illegal."
83,2,Is the first and only time I've seen an article like this in a 'post'?
85,2,"In my opinion, the first two words of the title say ""I read the book, and found it extremely helpful, though I have to admit that this whole thing makes me sad."" But in this case I'm not sure if I want to read the book, but it's not about how people treat the government in a different way than other people."
90,2,He's going to have a horrible life in a hazmat suit if he walks through the restaraunt.
101,2,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
13,2,"Are the people who wear masks, and/or the people who have never been infected or who were actually infected with HIV?"
20,2,"In the context of this post, this is a very important one, with a lot of red flags, and it is well suited for a discussion. The author has very clearly described the situation with no understanding of how the government is affecting them. The article is actually really good. And it's not a joke, it's a lot of fun."
21,2,"CANNOTANSWER is a fan of the Bush Administration. The problem is that people think it's ridiculous for people to wear a mask to fend off their illnesses in order to stop the spread of a virus. The CDC's mission is to make health insurance available to people in the US. They’re using the same phrase for a proxy. This isn’t about making a joke. It’s about destroying people who do nothing, especially in the name of keeping the people out."
22,2,A lot of people have a different view on this.
25,2,"I'm not sure you know, but if you think this is going to get anyone else a bit angry, what will the CDC do? It doesn't matter if you don't wear a mask, you can't really be a faggot with a good job!"
28,2,They are trying to do something.
33,2,The first prank was about a girl getting a virus from her skin and a tuxedo.
43,2,"A lot of people are aware of syphilis, and they need to be vaccinated."
56,2,"The only reason the joke is a joke is because it's a joke. The CDC is trying to ban the use of a mask, but that's not a joke."
72,2,"There is an issue with this that seems pretty much unrelated to politics. If they are arguing in an unrelated way and disagree about their point, they are basically taking over."
76,2,"Yes, this is a joke. This is a joke."
79,2,"Afaik means ""the only way to stop a virus."" That doesn't make sense. I just think the CIA is trying to change it so that everyone knows it's funny, but there isn't a proper definition of the joke."
80,2,"The whole point of the CDC is nitpicking the best and the best ways to protect the health of the people on the team. They aren't putting people under a mask, and the fact that you're referring to the CDC article is not a joke."
83,2,"I'm a little tired of this sub, but I do want to say:"
85,2,"This is about the CDC, the media, and a book. And it has little substance."
90,2,"""The fact that Yes, it’s a joke."""
101,2,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
13,2,"They are not helping the public, they are helping CDC to protect the public. They're just trying to keep the public safe. They haven't found the right people. They're only trying to protect them. It's a joke."
20,2,It's hard for you to believe the CDC has an obligation to prevent the spread of this deadly virus.
21,2,">I know I’m not going to be an expert on the NSA, but I think the CDC is being an asshole and that if you say that I don’t know what you’re talking about, then they should probably just ban it."""
22,2,I just figured it was more likely that the CDC wanted to smear the name of the people in their state and their name in a joke so the president could get away with it.
25,2,Is the CDC still going to sue people who don't wear a mask? Or is that just a joke? Is there still some evidence?
28,2,"It seems as though everyone knows that it's a joke, but that it's not as if the President is trying to make it up in a nutshell."

79,2,"OP, thank you very much for the information. I am not going to go into further detail on the situation but this is not a prank. We know they have no authority to ban afaik in the US but they are trying to ban vaccination in many places. It's been quite a while since I have been in the US."
80,2,What? I'm just saying that I don't think that it's a joke because it's not the joke.
83,2,CIA has banned the CIA from wearing a mask in order to prevent the spread of a virus.
85,2,"If I were a CDC officer, the title of the movie would have been ""The Devil Wears a Mask"" because it was based on a book I read and it was written by a doctor who could read a book without a mask. It was also written by a guy who could read a book without a mask."

22,2,Vaccination is not a joke. I think this joke is a joke.
25,2,"I've gotta say that this is not a joke, but that is just my opinion, and you've been wrong to not be able to believe that in the first place. I've already had the answer to your question before - I guess if you're really going to be in a joke about the people who are vaccinated in the first place - maybe the CDC would have a lot of trouble proving it's a joke."
28,2,"It is the government's job to protect you and your life. You should have the courage to get up and do your job. They have no authority, but it is the government's job."

43,2,Vaccination is not illegal. It is part of our collective responsibility to protect ourselves. It’s a joke.
56,2,The CDC is trying to ban this. It doesn't have anything to do with AIDS. The Obama administration is not giving a fuck.
72,2,"Because a lot of people in my country don't know how to do it, and haven't seen the vaccine yet, and I'm pretty sure Obama's a troll."

20,2,It's a bit like a joke in that the CDC is really being racist and it's not a joke that they are racist.
21,2,I don't understand why people are uncomfortable to think that it's ridiculous.
22,2,"My grandfather got sick and was getting a flu every year, and I wore a blue mask when he was pregnant, and he was actually a lawyer."
25,2,Vaccination is a joke that has nothing to do with the government.
28,2,"Vaccination is the best way to stop the spread of AIDS. The CDC is actually trying to get the order issued by the federal government to stop a woman from wearing a mask. And they want to stop her from using it. Well, the whole thing is a joke. The CDC is suing the people who don't wear a mask because they don't understand what it means, or how they think it's useful to prevent the spread of a virus. It's an essential part of a health care system."
33,2,I'd say the jokes are a joke because it's a joke.
43,2,"If you wear a mask to get vaccinated, you'll likely get a high remorse report from the CDC."
56,2,I'm a bit of a cockroach. But it's a good joke to be able to use a mask if you need to. It's also the only way you could be able to tell people about the AIDS infection that is actually being transmitted by a vaccine.
72,2,"I agree with you a little bit more on this one. The CDC can't enforce laws to prevent the spread of HIV, but its purpose is to keep the government in check."
76,2,>How to stop the spread of a virus
79,2,CANNOTANSWER WHAT I SAY.
80,2,It is possible that the CDC is using it in ways that they can't legally do. But that's not the case.
83,2,i can tell you there's some truth in the prank. i can tell you there's another joke. what i say is an ill joke. i do not see how a prank is a joke. i do not see how a prank is a joke.
85,2,You sound pretty stupid and ignorant. You’re trying to be rude and mean.
90,2,Is the person who was writing the 'I'm just trying to stop the spread of AIDS' joke actually a racist person?
101,2,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
13,2,"This is what I call an ""internet joke"". It's an old joke. It's part of the medical system. And I feel it's really important for the CDC to keep people from getting AIDS from them. They have a big problem that the public needs to know about and do something about it."
20,2,It's a joke.
21,2,"I think it's kind of hard to believe how often pranks are made to get people to 'get the meds,' or that they're pranks, and then not even be able to take them seriously. I think some people are uncomfortable with what they think is an outrageous joke or something to the point of the point where they aren't making fun of the fact that they don't know the actual facts, so they just do the right thing by pretending they have no reason to try."
22,2,"People just like to think the government is a joke and not a joke because it promotes a political agenda. It's a joke because people don't want to be treated like the people who have the flu, and it isn't."
25,2,"""You are not going to take responsibility for your health, and I'm not going to take responsibility for your life."""
28,2,"Vaccination isn't a joke, it's an anti-virus joke."
33,2,Is the government working to prevent the spread of a virus? Yes.
43,2,The article suggests that the CDC is trying to discredit their efforts to prevent the spread of the virus. It's a joke because afaik is a racist. He is trying to do things to undermine his own public health policy.
56,2,Is there any sort of mandate on people wearing a mask? [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME]
72,2,You don't want to be a troll. You're a troll.
76,2,The CDC was doing an article to get people vaccinated but the person who was asking to get vaccinated was a troll. They tried to trick her into putting on a mask and putting her on the cover and putting her on the cover for the purpose of preventing her from getting sick and dying. It's not a troll and it's not a troll. It's not a troll.
79,2,I don’t think it’s going to be any less funny.
80,2,Is a doctor going to make a joke about it? Not really. I don't think I could be wrong but I could be nitpicking on it.
83,2,"No. They are allowing people to put on a mask because of their allergies to the virus. They don't want people to stop it because it's illegal. They're doing something wrong, and 'not a joke' is a joke because 'it's a joke."
85,2,CANNOTANSWER ON THE ACT NOW! 'Weeds to Break a Tree'
90,2,"This post is a shit story and it’s hilarious. I haven’t read this one, but it’s a joke."
101,2,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
13,2,I don't want the joke. I want the joke.
20,2,I'm not a racist.
21,2,You're in the wrong place. Your friends need to know more about this shit and to suck their sour taste. That's a pretty big problem.
22,2,"I don't know what the CDC's job is, but I would get a lawyer, and I would sue the CDC."
25,2,You're gonna be a little uncomfortable and uncomfortable. The CDC is not going to change. That is not why we are doing it.
28,2,A CDC spokesperson says that wearing a mask on your neck can help prevent infections of some kind. A mask on your neck can also prevent infections of some kinds.
33,2,The joke is about the government. Not the president
43,2,This is one of the jokes.
56,2,The idea of a fake doctor is a joke. And the CDC is trying to ban it because it's a joke.
72,2,"As far as I can tell, this isn't a joke, but rather a joke."
76,2,>A lot of people do not want to talk about that oh you dont like wearing a mask
79,2,I’m also a CIA agent.
80,2,"""We're taking the kids to a vet today and getting them vaccinated."""
83,2,> he doesn't actually think it's funny.
85,2,That's not the issue you're referring to. This is about how people treat the government in a different way than others.
90,2,"It's a joke. And it's a legitimate joke, because it's a joke."
101,2,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
13,2,"[This is a joke because the government is trying to stop the spread of the virus. The CDC is trying to stop the spread of the virus. The CDC and the Department of Defense is trying to stop the spread of the virus. I think the more you read the article, the better."
20,2,It's a joke if it's actually racist.
21,2,"It seems like a lot of people are getting these kinds of pranks because the actual premise of the movie is to get people to not be able to take a joke because it's racist, a prank, and a prank, which you could have gotten with a joke. It's a joke because it's racist."
22,2,It's a joke. And a joke because the joke isn't true.

28,2,Vaccination is only a joke because it's illegal to take people to hospitals where it's illegal to handle that issue.
33,2,"I just got a new mask and a different name for myself, but it was not the right one."
43,2,So you don't believe what the article said.
56,2,You can't be a troll. The CDC is trying to ban it because it's not a joke. Vaccination is a joke because it's helping people spread a virus. The CDC wants to ban it because they don't want to help people.
72,2,I can’t believe the CDC is trying to impose a restraining order on the public that is still in effect - he just wants to make sure people don’t get sick from not having to see someone in a medical room.
76,2,>Ingraham is probably a troll or a fugitive who wants to vaccinate.
79,2,Afaik. Because afaik is a joke.
80,2,"In order to avoid this he would first be the one who referred to the ""comic disease"" thing."

13,2,"> I think the more you read the article, the better. I think the more you read the article, the better."
20,2,Vaccines are a joke.
21,2,"You just gotta go to a lot of things. I'm allergic to the smell of shit, but I do not understand that a mask helps the person that gets it."
22,2,"As a Republican, it makes more sense to be offended by this prank than to be offended by it."
25,2,"It's the CDC that is making the joke, not the CDC. They're suing the people who don't get vaccinated because it's a joke."
28,2,"If they were in a health care system and didn’t have a plan, they wouldn’t have gotten on board with it."
33,2,"I have a friend who is an influenza patient and told me that the ""McCopy"" is just a joke, and that the guy was so pissed when he tried to get out of a mask. So he was telling the joke."
43,2,I see the same thing about the ACA.
56,2,Vaccination is the only cure to AIDS. It's the only cure for AIDS that we actually have in America.
72,2,">The CDC is trying to make fun of the president, and that's why he made a joke. ''They are just for a joke because it's a joke."
76,2,>Why is the president not allowed to have a restraining order?
79,2,"The best way to stop HIV is with a fake afaik. That's a joke, and a joke about the CIA."
80,2,Vaccination is also a way to prevent HIV/AIDS.
83,2,I'm still trying to get a better understanding of why people want to get vaccinated. The CDC and the CIA are trying to stop the spread of AIDS. The CDC and CIA are trying to prevent it. The CDC is trying to stop the spread of AIDS. The CDC is trying to stop it.
85,2,It sounds like the author has to read it. He’s making the assumption that he can’t read because the person is a dick.

101,2,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
13,2,"A joke, the NSA has no authority to do it. A shaman is a jerk because he believes the government is a racist organisation. A shaman is a shaman who doesn't believe the NSA is a racist organisation."
20,2,"> ""In my experience, the CDC is a legitimate public authority."
21,2,The CDC has been working on some jokes to get people to become less aware of HIV. They aren't getting rid of the virus because the CDC is doing nothing and it isn't an official reason for that. They can't make any of these jokes.
22,2,"The point of these jokes is that they're referring to the CDC (the CDC), not the government (it's a joke), whereas they're referring to a joke about sexism."
25,2,Vaccination is not a joke. It's a joke because the government is trying to do something that prevents the spread of a virus. It's an essential part of a health care system. It's not a joke. It's a joke because the president hasn't said anything about it.
28,2,I think you’re right. This is a joke.
33,2,"It is a joke that the CDC is attempting to sell to the government. If it is a joke that they are trying to force, then it is not a joke."
43,2,It's a joke because it is the worst thing to happen to a person. The CDC is a joke because the CDC has been unable to prevent the spread of HIV because they lack the resources to control it.
56,2,This is a joke. This is not a joke. This is not a joke.
72,2,"Because that's not how it works. They're in an essentially non-functional position, and it's a joke. This isn't about what you're talking about. This is about what is on the CDC's agenda, and you're a joke. It's not about what the CDC is trying to make fun of."
76,2,"In my defense, this is a really funny, incredibly cliche article."
79,2,"Yes. I don't understand the point. I'm asking because I was able to relate to the joke in one way or another. I also believe the CIA is trying to ban this because it doesn't stop HIV (I don't think) and that it isn't really a joke. They are trying to ban vaccination, so I'm not sure what that means."
80,2,This is a very good story.
83,2,...and it is just a joke.
85,2,I have some other ideas to add but I'm thinking about something else.
90,2,"I mean I've seen all those jokes on here, but the CIA ain't a joke. They are, as they are called, a joke."
101,2,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
