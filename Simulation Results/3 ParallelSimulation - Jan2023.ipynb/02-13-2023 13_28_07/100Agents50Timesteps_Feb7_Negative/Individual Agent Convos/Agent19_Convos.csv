19,1,"I just want to add that this is an incredibly sensitive topic for another sub. What are you getting into? I mean, basically, the government wants to take away your rights as a vaccinated person to protect them from the spreading of an infectious disease. But it also means it's too important for you to go to an event and get the vaccinations because you have an infection and can't do that. I'm not sure where you got it from, but I'm not sure how that applies."

20,19,"Vaccines can be given at any time in the game by the player. It is not an endorsement by the league. He's the one who made it clear there was no danger. His point was not to be involved in the problem, but to get to the root of it, because I don't see it as a shady thing."
43,19,"I don't see how anyone would be against this guy. But I am going to be blunt and say, ""This is one of those people who seems like they've got too much power to be involved in anything."""
44,19,"What’s the law? When people get vaccinated, the government will tell the medical personnel that they are being vaccinated. Then they will say, ‘No’, ‘No’, “No!” and they’ll say, ‘Oh, no, no, no, no, no!’. If the medical staff doesn’t give a proper explanation of the medical staff’s actions, they’ll say ‘I’m a fraud.'”"

20,19,It's the only reason why they would put on a mask and wear a mask. That's the kind of thing they could put on the player. He could put on a mask or a mask for him at any time when he was doing it. You can't put on a mask with a mask and then get vaccinated. They could do it without a mask and then just take off when he gets home. It's the same as having a mask on when you walk into a game.
43,19,"Honestly, I don't think you're the only one who's sounded like a bad person. But you're a person who doesn't have any sort of understanding of a person. I've never seen it, but I'd be scared if I did. I would just shit on that guy."

20,19,I don't see how it could be possible for him to be vaccinated. The CDC is the one that would be able to do something like that if it wasn't mandatory.
43,19,"What are the big risks? Vaccination? I've heard that the biggest danger is when a player gets fucked and they can't even tell the truth, so it's up to them to find an alternative."
44,19,You are right. I lied and got a little annoyed. I didn't think it was a joke.
58,19,I was an RN and a current doctor. But I feel the need to talk to a doctor about this.
70,19,"It's not funny at all to ask people to wear a mask every day because they're sick, and you're not the person who has to use it to stop the spread of a disease."
72,19,What is a joke? Does the president know if there's a legitimate threat to preventing the spread of a virus? What are the rumors that he's trying to sell this to?
74,19,"You can get a temporary restraining order, but you can't do that in the US. You can't get a temporary restraining order from the NSA."

44,19,Is he being a dick?
58,19,Is there a good reason to go get vaccinated?
70,19,I think a good excuse is to ask people to wear a mask every day to stop a virus spread.
72,19,A person can be a 'troll' in an organization that makes a public statement to protect themselves. Then you have to give it to someone who is not a member of the FDA.
74,19,I think the government is a conspiracy nut because of the NSA and the CDC. You should definitely get a temporary restraining order from a law firm.
75,19,They could have some reason not to allow it unless there is evidence to suggest they've done a lot of things shady in the past.
88,19,"I think it's a virus that's not a virus, and he might not even want to wear it. If he doesn't have a mask, he probably will not."

19,11,This is going to be my first conversation on the CDC in quite a few years and I'm going to say this:

43,19,Vaccination isn't a joke. It's a joke.
44,19,I see your point. Is there any other way that the government can prevent the spread of a virus? It is the best way to protect yourself.
58,19,"I don't even know the real story, but it's possible they are trying to stop the disease from spreading, even though the CDC doesn't believe it. They've already told the CDC about this and it's not a scam."
70,19,I would be embarrassed if I was a white guy. I'd be embarrassed if I got infected with the virus.
72,19,"> If you aren't a citizen of your country, the CDC is your friend. That's why you have to go to the CDC."
74,19,It's the government's job to do all of it.
75,19,I have never seen a movie about this but the person is on the side of the gov.
88,19,It's pretty much what they're trying to do.

19,1,I do not have a diagnosis but I do know that I have had a doctor and I am going to ask him about it.
19,4,"A man in Canada is wearing a mask to stop a virus. He voluntarily carries it to the hospital if you have a bad case of a virus and he must be wearing a mask. He is a dangerous person. If he is a danger to other people, the government is not going to do anything about it. They are only going to help. If he is in a danger situation, they will be asked to come to the hospital if it's in need of vaccinating them. If not, they will tell you what to say about it"
19,7,"I'm a US citizen. If you want to make a change, you need to come down to the US government. They don't have a mandate if you want to. They have a mandate if you need to."

72,19,"Assuming the public is aware, there is a problem, you aren't a troll in a group. You are just a member of your group. I know they are aware, but I've heard some of them talk about sneezing the mouth for the virus. Those people should take note of the fact that they don't think the problem is a virus, but they are aware of it. I know they have a lot of other issues and are aware of it, so they should probably ask the question on which one of them was about that"

43,19,I don't get why this is so funny unless you're the victim of racism. The CDC will probably take action if you're going to do anything. It's a stupid joke and not a joke.
44,19,So it is not an issue of humor but that I'm not sure what you're talking about.
58,19,They're trying to prevent spread of a virus. It's called a mask. The real question is what should the president wear? That the person has the right to be protected? Because I am a sexist guy and it's not a great idea.
70,19,I think OP is missing the part where the government doesn't know who is infected.
72,19,"A lot of things are not the same. A lot of things are not in the US, but in many other places....and this is a major issue."
74,19,"I don't know what is the meaning of the ""We know the government is not a conspiracy to stop the spread of a virus. We know the CDC.

19,1,">I think OP is missing the part where the government is trying to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. A lot of people are infected with a virus.a virus, not a virus."
19,4,"What is the real point of a hat? Why the fuck are you trying to take it down? The masks will be banned on the streets, etc. This is a major issue and there isn't any sexism involved."
19,7,I'd put my hat on.
19,11,"I know I'm a bit of a racist, but I'm really sick of the government's misguided attitude towards the current situation. The government is trying to do things that aren't racist, and I can understand the frustrations. I don't understand why it's funny, and I'm afraid to go for a restraining order. I am sorry that your family is on vacation."
20,19,"The CDC is the only person who could be able to do something like that if it wasn't mandatory. I'm not saying this is not a shady thing, but I think it's a pretty decent idea."
43,19,"It is a joke, but it can't be a joke."
44,19,I'm actually pretty sure the title is misleading. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
58,19,"It seems that if the government has an effective restraining order on it it's unlikely it will end up like that. Then it's kind of the same thing. But Obama isn't a good president and the CDC isn't an effective policy. He has a mask, but not the right one."
70,19,"There is no joke about the vaccine being so effective against viruses and that this is what is being used to prevent them from spreading. I know that's not a joke, but that's not how it works. And it's not a joke because of a number of factors, and there is no way of knowing if the virus is spreading."
72,19,"The only other thing I can think of where the CIA and other government institutions are concerned is their own protections of the public, so I'm afraid they would be retaliating."
74,19,"It's not an ad. It's an ""insane person that would need the restraining order to stop the spread of a virus. If this were me, I'd put on a mask, and wear a mask, because it would stop a virus from being spread to people with a virus. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of a virus. Please wear masks."
75,19,"I know that wearing a mask in public is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.''The guy who did this is basically a dick. He just gets to be his own boss in a really brash way.""''"

90,19,Yes. I was not being sarcastic and I am not a racist. What about you?
100,19,"A hat with the right to do whatever, if you want to say it, just say ""I'm not very nice. I don't see the problem with it,"" and then add the ""I think it's ok to not wear a mask, and ingraham said it's restricting our rights to keep us locked in!"" and then you get a few examples from when someone is actually trying to get it to work."
101,19,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
19,1,Is wearing a mask required? Because that's what I figured because my friends say it's a hat thing and it's the wrong type of mask that they wear. The only reason I've heard of someone wearing one is because that's what I think is the right type of mask.
19,4,"I think this is a fairly legitimate concern. As I understand it, I cant really go fuck myself for wearing a mask."
19,7,"I think the problem here is that the government is trying to use a hat as a hat, but they are trying to prevent this from happening."
19,11,I was just thinking about how many people get sick from the flu and I just didn't know which part of the country to go to if you don't have a mask. It's all over the place.

43,19,It's also a joke that the CDC is trying to prevent the spread of a virus by doing a mask thing and not vaccinating a virus.
44,19,People have their rights violated by the govt to vaccinate.
58,19,"The CDC has never said anything about the NSA attempting to prevent the spread of a virus, stating that they do not believe the CDC's policy. That is a very well known fact."
70,19,I just read some other posts that mention people wanting to wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus.

The joke is just a bunch of little things you can say and it just doesn't seem to go well. It's like people say ""the government hasn't really changed its policy on minors."" And the joke is saying ""I'm not very nice. I don't see the problem with it"" and ""I think it's a joke."
101,19,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
19,1,I'm pretty sure this is a post about the government trying to stop a virus and it was written by a white male who wants to protect women from being abused and abused.
19,4,There is no sexism involved in the fight against the virus. Its a viral problem that is not about just the spreading.
19,7,"This is a terrible topic because there is no ebola vaccine in the US. I haven't really read the article, but I have been to the CDC and they do have a mandate to vaccinate. It's not only a hat, but a mask, and a mask, as they called it, and is designed to be a way to prevent a virus."
19,11,"It was interesting that this was a joke. I can't remember much other than the initial line of it. There's no question the CDC is trying to do it, but in the last month a group of people went into the hospital and tried to use a hat."
20,19,"It's funny that you are using this as an excuse to not get vaccinated in NYC despite actually being a good fan of the CDC and the CDC. And to be clear, you don't have to get vaccinated at all. It's not ""nonsensical"" to say that the vaccine isn't illegal, but it's a shady idea."
43,19,"The CDC has no obligation to take the fight to their fullest, and a sham would be a dick, so they should start to put it into action."
44,19,I thought it was a joke. I thought it was a joke.
58,19,"In this context, the president's mask isn't a joke, it's the shambles of an Obama administration and the NSA are actually trying to stop the spread of viruses, not to stop the spread of the virus."
70,19,I don’t see the issue here.
72,19,"Are you saying """"I would have done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask""? Because you're using the word ""restraining order"". This is about the government is in power, to not eat in the same way it is in ours. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of a virus."

20,19,"Yes, you're a racist and you shouldn't be wearing a mask in NYC. This is a joke, but it's a decent idea. You do have a valid argument that wearing a mask in NYC is a good way to stop the spread of the virus."
43,19,"In some cases, it's possible that the CDC would be willing to put a ban on the helmet, or at least that they could have done it in a less offensive manner, causing a spike in the likelihood that someone will try to get someone to use the vaccine."
44,19,"If there is nothing illegal to do, you can do it, but you need to make your case if you want to go on a vaccination."
58,19,You have a good question. How much is this going to cost for him to have to do with his mask? Does he want to get a full blown flu?
70,19,"In 2009, the president decided not to wear a mask because he felt they were a way of getting people to be aware of the virus. But then he decided to wear one because the virus spread. So he lost a mask. And then just said, ""I know that's not a joke, but that's not how it works. And it's not funny at all to ask people to wear a mask every day because they're sick, and you're not the person who has to use it to stop the virus spread."
72,19,"I know that it's a joke, but there are lots of other issues with vaccines that the government is trying to address."
74,19,This is why there is no law against the government to use public money to keep the vaccines in place.

70,19,I think a good excuse is to ask people to wear a mask every day to stop the spread of a virus.
72,19,It sounds like Mr. Clinton and his family have an idea for a joke. It's been like that in real life for years.
74,19,Unless you have a hat on that is a troll. This is just a scam scumbag that you're scumbags that have no evidence to prove their point.
75,19,The issue here is about a lack of any actual legal support for a virus. I know this is not a joke but that's it.

19,1,"A doctor told me that ""A mask is an aversion for a reason."" This is all part of a joke."

You can also just say, ""I'm a bit sexist, but I think the CDC is a very good example of government failure."" And the only thing that would be different is that the government doesn't even try. This was actually a joke"
19,11,I think people are just being silly to think about the issue as a joke.
20,19,That CDC has made a huge mistake by putting on a mask that they have no authority to use at all.

90,19,So you think that putting on a mask and not wearing a mask would prevent people from going to a doctor or hospital in cases where the patient is infected is a joke?

70,19,I don't know if you read the rest of the comments. I have heard people tell you that the CDC does not understand the fact that the masks are not very common in the US. Is there a reason for that? Is it possible it was used for a sex practice?

58,19,>the actual question is what should the president wear?
70,19,"In this context, i'd say the joke is a joke. It's a joke because the CDC has no interest in preventing the spread of a virus. It's a joke because they do not understand that people who wear a mask should be ashamed of how they did it. The joke is also about the CDC being a racist shit gang.

43,19,">""We want to stop and prevent the spread of a virus. It's called the ""Virus"" because of the amount of bacteria on the ER and it's actually called ""Virus."""
44,19,It’s a joke.
58,19,“I was not a good doctor until I got sick. I wasn’t a sick person and I was sick of them.”
70,19,You're not a racist. You're an racist.
72,19,"As far as r/police is concerned, I'm pretty sure they are just trying to make fun of a troll."
74,19,"I want to rephrase the title to ""I don't want to be the one who doesn't know anything about the CDC. They're working on a temporary restraining order against people wearing a mask."""
75,19,"I'd also like to add that this is an article about Obama, if you're into that, the article on him seems more about the CDC than the CDC. If you're in a political conspiracy and haven't read the article, you're not a racist."

100,19,Are you gonna go to the White House on Sunday? I do have a big thing for you and the people I work with.
101,19,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
19,1,I've been wondering how the government is using a falsehood to justify that ridiculous comment.
19,4,"""...the whole point of a hat is that it's about how to keep the virus at bay. The point is that it's only about how to prevent the spread of the virus. A hat is a virus. A hat is a virus. A mask is a virus. A hat is a virus. A hat is a virus. A hat is a virus. A hat is a virus. A hat is a virus. A hat is a virus."
19,7,Are you not racist? You don't even have a right to be a racist. You're just being racist.
19,11,It's been a bit of a lot of years. I can say from experience that the world is really different from us. I know that it's a joke and the people trying to help people to prevent a disease don't actually care about the health of others because it doesn't make sense to keep them alive. But I can also say that the way the world is treated is not the best way to protect your health and health. I don't think the CDC should have to stop treating people with that hats. They just have to give them a troll.
20,19,"The CDC and the league both have been in the same boat, so you should be able to get to the bottom of what you're getting."
43,19,"No, the president is being a joke and denying anything to the public."
44,19,"In my opinion if the government is using the CDC to prevent and treat health problems, it’s probably going to be worse than that."
58,19,I've been on all these issues for over 10 years. And this is why we use a lot of humor. Vaccination is very hard to avoid. What we do is sexist.
70,19,"You've always said it as a joke - and I do, too - so much that you're a troll."
72,19,"So I thought the first sentence of the sentence was ""We wear a mask""? Then I read the second sentence."
74,19,It's a joke.

88,19,And a few others. The first two are not the most obvious nonsense I've heard from any lawyer but the first three are the most important.
90,19,"A joke about it, or something, is a joke. It's not about being a racist, it's about being insensitive and not wanting to talk to people. It's about not being racist or anything. It's also about being insensitive. I can see why a joke is the best joke, but I really just don't see it as a joke and don't take it personally."
100,19,"I can't believe this is actually true. I'm a nsfw specialist and I have seen a lot of racist stuff here too, not only on this sub."
101,19,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
19,1,"The fact that you're on the wrong side of the issue and you're being irrational, and you're making it out of spite to yourself, makes me cringe. Honestly, it's not even about the vaccine, but it's about the virus."
19,4,"Yes, it is a joke. It is a joke. It's not racist, it's racist. But it does not mean that there is no sexism involved."
19,7,I don't think we are in agreement.

58,19,"I'd get vaccinated before I got sick, and I wouldn't even wear my mask for fear of making a concussion. But, it's not a joke. I'd just go get some good health care."
70,19,I don't think it is a joke to use a mask in public to stop the spread of a virus.
72,19,"So the president's goal was to get people to wear a mask. This will be a joke. It's a joke that they're trying to make fun of, and they're actually trying to make fun of."

88,19,"He wrote an article about the virus, and this is why we're seeing it all the time."
90,19,"There's no difference in making jokes in this subreddit, if you're a part of the subreddit and you want to talk to someone about a joke, you have a right to think. If your intention is to be a troll, you're not a racist. The point is that when you try to make a joke, you can't make it funny unless you're trying to make it funny. You can't make it funny, you have to give it a chance. That's why people have to have "

19,7,My comment is that I want to be the one on this site that was just to get people to wear a mask. I also want people to be able to see me on TV and talk about this ridiculous story.

20,19,"No, it's a joke."
43,19,"Vaccination isn't a joke, the CDC is trying to stop the spread of a virus. Vaccination is the best way to prevent the spread of a virus."

19,11,The guy wearing a mask is trying to get people to wear a mask to protect their health. I can't think of any joke in that thread that is racist.

44,19,It doesn't matter how many omissions it makes.
