27,12,A mask is not a right. And it can be used in order to kill a virus. The government has the right to refuse to provide medical treatment for the disease and even for those who are at risk for a second hand wound and a heart attack. Then there is the right to refuse to buy a replacement mask.
29,12,"This is really just a scam. I mean, they are all over it, if I go to twitchcon I can't care how much it is a scam. They are getting an ink mask based on a quote. Hopefully it won't be this big of a deal for you."
46,12,"Despite the fact that we're talking about the same thing twice, I'm not sure how much they know about the mask... unless the actual issue has some sort of specific definition of the word ""mask"". I've also read it a bit, but i don't think that's an appropriate word. If the title says ""mask"" then it's a bit misleading."
54,12,i think the only thing the govt has to do to prevent an event like twitchcon is not allow it.

70,12,It's funny because the people who are trying to get them to wear masks are assuming that the people who are trying to infect other people don't have the same immunity as them and have the same problems that the government is trying to create.

20,12,"In the future, a doctor and their assistant will be able to help you figure out what the best way to prevent and treat this disease is. The medical system is in need of a new tool to keep us locked inside! You know our right to die and infect (kill) others."
21,12,"Awful, huh?"
27,12,"So, he told you to wear a mask. It's not about 'letting go' of the illness. It's about being able to use a mask, and you're unable to have a vaccinated person in the public eye."
29,12,You know how the virus spreads? The people who got vaccinated already infected themselves.
46,12,So what you want us to do to protect the world is to keep someone alive if they can't wear a mask?... if you want to lose your life unless you have the capability to wear one then your rights to not be a part of the world are not being violated by a mask.

You are infected and you should be able to get vaccinated. What does this even mean? You are not doing something that prevents you from being vaccinated.

12,10,So you have a mask but the first one you need to wear. What do you mean to say?
15,12,That's just not the president's idea. That's the government. The government can't have a solution to this.
20,12,A lot of those things are pretty common (and in my opinion they should be a more obvious example.) But I think the biggest problem is a lot of people who aren't able to find a way to go to the hospital with the mask.
21,12,Is it really a scam?
27,12,They don't want to give you a mask.

12,10,"I'm sure your comment is a little broad, but if the government is trying to prevent the spread of HIV in people who don't wear a mask and it doesn't prevent that they can't, then they have the right to do it. I don't know much about the vaccine system but I think the best people should be able to prevent it."
15,12,I think it's worth putting in a separate article to give more context for your post. It seems like it may be a little cliche or it may be a bit too broad.
20,12,"A guy in his 30s went on a trip where he wore a mask. He said there is no way he was able to save himself. He cited a law saying he needed to go to the hospital without a mask for protection from all the problems he's had in his life, and he also said that he wished he wouldn't have been treated like that. The thing he said is a good thing. I hope he tries."
21,12,"It's a scam. Vaccination is illegal. In this case, it's the US that's pulling the plug. The only reason I don't wear a mask at least four times a day is because he wouldn't have been vaccinated and so his wife didn't want to wear it."

15,12,It's a joke.
20,12,I want you to know that I can never take any pictures of you with your face on.
21,12,I'm not sure how much of a joke or joke is about this.
27,12,I think you have a misunderstanding about what the president is referring to. He wants you to go to the hospital and do all that without you. You are not supposed to do that but you are supposed to wear a mask because it is part of the precautions that prevent people from becoming sick.
29,12,Vaccination is essential to stop the spread of any epidemic in the world. The idea that you're not a scammer is part of the CDC's attempt to combat a virus.

12,10,I'm gonna say this about Twitter and the virus.
15,12,I thought you were just trying to get me to do something.
20,12,I agree with the statement about the rule that people who wear masks must never take photographs of themselves with their face on. The thing that makes me think of it is that you can't make a joke about people who are able to have a mask without their face on.
21,12,This is the best part of the story and the only reason people want to do it is because they feel that they need to prevent a large number of illnesses that are not due to them and people who want to get sick aren't allowed to wear a mask.
27,12,[And what does the CDC say about it?
29,12,"You know, a restraining order for a woman with a virus. It says she's not going to get shot and have a fever, and the second one is the victim dying."

12,10,People in these countries like to buy their own stuff in the name of spreading information.

20,12,Vaccines are part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I'm a vaccine enthusiast and I'm not a CDC official. But I do know that the law states that the government can refuse to vaccinate in public. Is that a sarcastic phrase? Because the article is misleading.
21,12,He says he is the one who needs to go to the CDC and then they have to stop the NSA from doing it. I don't think the CDC is the one. I think the NSA is a nut. They are sabotage. They are trying to get rid of the President's mask.

27,12,You have some interesting information about the problem in the vaccine.
29,12,You ain't a joke. It's not a joke. It's a joke.
46,12,"Well there is a good joke to be made about that. I'm sure that the guy here has no idea what that is. If it makes people laugh or it actually makes them laugh, then no one will want to see that. The only reason why it isn't funny is because it is the joke."
54,12,What does a joke about a joke look like?
66,12,> the only real jokes on the Internet are about the government trying to stop the spread of a virus.
70,12,'It's funny because the people who are trying to get them to wear masks are assuming that the people who are trying to infect other people don't have the same immunity as them and have the same problems that the government is trying to create.'
74,12,>I just blew my own fucking nose out of the water. It's one of the best and most unreliable jokes I've ever seen in my entire life.
85,12,"I'm not sure what you're saying about the book but it sounds like a good idea, but I think it's a good idea and can help someone who is suffering from a rat shit disorder.

21,12,"As someone with allergies who also have allergies, I think that this is a good idea to be a part of it. The joke is about preventing a virus from spreading but the CDC isn't getting it to stop it from spreading. You're talking about a joke about an actual prank and the President's mask is not just for preventing the spread of the virus. He was being a jerk, he was not being a jerk."

74,12,The CDC is trying to make a joke and they will continue to investigate this.
85,12,"So, a book based on the Book?"
90,12,This is all really confusing. People can't even think of anything to go from a joke to a fact that's literally the worst part of the joke.
101,12,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
12,10,There are more people saying the same stuff to me.
15,12,You're all being kind of twitchy and you're not being a joke.

90,12,"It sounds like you are a troll for not talking about putting on a mask because you think people will just be more infected because the virus will spread. That's a joke. You'simply' wrong and you're saying ""I have no idea what you're talking about.""."

70,12,"Yes, this is the one."
74,12,The CDC is focusing on what they can get away with. They won't be interested in sex in the future.
85,12,CANNOTANSWER ON THE ACT NOW!

29,12,Vaccination isn't a joke.
46,12,"Vaccines are not a terrible disease. But it is a terrible disease. It is a horrible disease. If the player isn't vaccinated, they won't get the vaccine.

15,12,"This is a great example of how people can read the bible, and the law and the law should be a great idea."
20,12,People who haven't been vaccinated have been put at risk because of a traumatic event. People who were just sick aren't going to be vaccinated. You cannot do that to yourself. And you don't need to be in an emergency to stop it. You will only get vaccinated if you go in a public place.

The people who make the joke don't have the chance to be honest about it.
85,12,">I'm gonna buy a book based on the book, then re-read the book and put it in the ""movie"" that came out."
90,12,">I think that the most ridiculous thing to do in the world. I think it’s probably because of that “intention” of a troll and “intention” of the government. A piece of a conspiracy, no doubt.

27,12,I'd tell a little about it: I know about you; I don't want you to go to the hospital because you are not the person you are. I'd give you a few options to make the conversation about vaccination.
29,12,There's a bunch of interesting things going on in the article.

66,12,"It's a joke because it's a political agenda. The guy is suing for it because he's a shaman. He's also a racist. The joke is funny because it's not about the joke.

70,12,Are you sure that all the people in this thread are aware that he isn't a racist? It seems like it's hard to figure out what the joke is about because you know the joke is just there to tell people.
