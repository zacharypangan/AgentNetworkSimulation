41,34,This is a scam. It is also part of the 'right to die and infect (kill) others' thing. What is the point?

In my town there is a market with more than 40 different kinds of groceries. I live near the grocery store. I am going to be there as soon as I get a bite.

45,34,I have a friend who is an experienced CDC agent who has worked in the defense of a major defense contractor for years and was in charge of dealing with the medical team. The guy at the CDC had no idea what was up until the end. So it has been a bit hard to figure out the source of this information.

88,34,This is a question I’m asked every day and every day.
90,34,"There are a bunch of things that need to change in our society, and it's easy to make a point."
34,7,Why are you laughing at the people with no masks?
34,15,"I'm a huge fan of the stuff that the CDC has created. If you don't think that's correct, a mask is a really good way to help prevent cancer. It's a very basic and basic way to prevent this from happening. And I'm not even sure what the name of this is."

55,34,"In America, people are always allowed to wear a mask."
70,34,I'm not sure how much I could agree with you. A mask isn't like a real mask. A mask has no place in the human body.
72,34,"So you're describing the situation in this thread, you're the CDC."
75,34,Arachnovirus is the reason for the lack of a life insurance plan. It's not a legitimate disease. It's a disease that can cause multiple conditions.
85,34,That mask is really not a problem at all.
88,34,A lot of people do not want to talk about the virus. He needs a mask.
90,34,I don't understand how people have to make that claim. A lot of people imply they have a right to live their lives and will die from the virus if they don't wear a mask. But it seems to me that the only thing that people need to do is to wear a mask. Its not that you have a right to die and live your lives. Its that you have the right to choose if you want to live your lives or not.
34,7,Because a virus doesn't always exist. You can't just wear a mask for a lifetime.
34,15,"I'm sorry, but if I was not wearing a mask, I would wear a mask for the rest of my life. I am not going to get vaccinated. I am going to be a jackass in Washington and have to get him vaccinated."

75,34,You don't care about the disease. You care about the people.

88,34,It is not a virus. It is a virus. It is not a virus.
90,34,"""There are a bunch of things that need to change in our society, and it's easy to make a point."""
34,7,"Yes, it's a CDC article with the message ""Mix a mask into the opportunistic arachnovirus outbreak of the USA, so people can have a vaccinated life, but they can't get vaccinated for anything like that."""
34,15,This is an important one. A mask is part of a measure that protects people from HIV/AIDS and it does not stop it.
34,16,"I would go to a TWitchCon and say ""I don't want the government to come on my behalf."""
41,34,"Those are the kind of things people want and that's what they do. If it's a scam, why don't the President make a statement that his team members can't do whatever they want, in order to help him if he's not in a good position?"
45,34,... and that is a good way to start the season.
52,34,... I'm an agnostic lawyer.
55,34,"I'm a big fan of the anti-vaccine nonsense of it. CDC trying to deter and prevent the spread of a virus. The thing about having an irrational assumption about the President's actions is that, for all the good of us, he has to be out of office."
70,34,"I'm a really bad smoker and a smoker hasn't smoked any cigars since I was five. My dad smoked a lot of cigars. He said ""I would just smoke more in general,"" but he still does."
72,34,"This isn't about the govt, it's about the govt. that makes things up a lot. The govt can get a hold of things to do and go after people with HIV/AIDS."
75,34,"I'm not sure why people keep the arachnovirus in their homes, they need a mask because they don't want the disease to happen to people they don't care about. This is the same issue that causes people to get sick. The only thing that really helps is the people that are affected."
85,34,"There's a movie titled, The Devil Wears a Mask, that teaches you about how to read the Bible and the Law and how to read it, and how to use it. I believe it's called The Law of Fire and the Law and a movie based on it."

90,34,It was just a joke.
34,7,"As much as I hate it, the whole anti-vaccine nonsense and the skewed propaganda and omission of the word ""hivemind"" is hilarious and trolly. I feel a little guilty that people are being skewed on this. The govt. is so evil, that they need to stop the disease to come out of the mouth."
34,15,"A virus and other anti-vaccine drugs don't have to be the same, and the people who do aren't at risk. I think you need a new person to look out for you, not a new president."
34,16,They did it in 2009... and the CDC decided to not take it off at all. It's still a joke.
41,34,Is a liar or is a fraud.
45,34,"I'd say you're a good person for asking a question, and that's a pretty good reason to go to the office. I've tried, but none work for you, and I don't think you have any real reason to."

85,34,This is a great idea for a film.
88,34,It doesn’t have to be a virus. It’s a mask. A mask is a virus.

34,7,"You don't wear a mask when you can't see anyone. But if you're not being critical, if you're thinking of people who don't see this, you don't really have a legitimate reason to go to the office, so you don't get to be an asshole."

34,16,A couple of things. And I'm gonna say that's a lot of things.
41,34,The President is just an idiot.
45,34,I know you're being a scam but I want to be a CDC restraining order because the president doesn't abide by their policy if they have to wear a mask.
52,34,I'd like to go back and re-read your post as a bit of a joke.
55,34,"It's a really simple question, but I think that it's important to remember that the government doesn't necessarily have to be black or white. You can't just get them to wear masks. If they don't want the government to do it, they'll start threatening you."
70,34,"I can tell you that it's the problem, and if you ever try to tell me the truth it may be a lie. And you probably don't know it. I'm not saying you have to go to work with a mask, but it works."
72,34,The CDC is a troll.
75,34,"Vaccines are good, but they are not recommended for people who have it in their homes. The only thing that really helps is the people that are affected. The only thing that really helps is the people that are affected."
85,34,I'm sure he has a good idea for a film.

34,7,There's a really big problem with the government when the government is trying to protect us from the virus.
34,15,I don't think this is racist. Vaccination is a measure deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. They do not seem to be that racist.
34,16,"And then the President starts saying ""...I don't like it when people... [get it.](http://www.stfu.org/post/iamthegov_and_reddit_____) is going to be a restraining order. "".

55,34,"Vaccination is a really common disease. It's usually linked to a very specific disease. This has been done by the CDC with the approval of a small group of doctors in the USA, and presumably they've made some kind of recommendations to their members to prevent it."

75,34,"I don't know if that was really a big deal, but when it came down to it I was like hey, I could fuck this guy with a fake mask."
85,34,"Those things don't really sound bad, and people aren't being very good at it. The fact that the book is based on a book, and a movie based on it is a testament to how ineffective the CDC's policies were about how to reduce the number of people who need to be in hospital and what was done to prevent that sort of abuse is a sign that things are better than they were then. The book is a fantastic example of how people can read the Bible, and the law and the law should be a great idea for a film."

41,34,"The only thing I can't stop reading this post is the fact that ""Twitchcon"" is the largest event in the history of politics. It's a show promoting propaganda. And I can't stop reading this post. The article states that people wear masks when they go out to play. The CDC is responsible for the vaccines and facial hair masks. They even use a mask to protect people from a virus and the public gets sick. They don't know how to wear one. They even use a mask to protect people from a virus."

34,7,We don't have the same type of masks as the government. There's a lot of stuff that they're doing that's not even legal. You just have to hush up to the people who pity and don't want to be the bad guy.
34,15,So there's no point in putting on a mask and then doing a piece of legal advice in the hope that your government will eventually shut them down?
34,16,"People are going to die from a virus in their lifetime.', ""I'm going to get your life insurance."""
41,34,"It's an interesting way to look at it. You are saying, ""They are trying to make you feel stupid. I think they are trying to make him look dumb. I think we've got a very valid argument here: The government has a right to take everything they want. It's not illegal."""

52,34,"Vaccination is a horrible disease. If the team is vaccinated, a player can not be infected. If they aren't vaccinated, you will have to wear a mask. The only way to stop it is to put on a mask so you can be vaccinated and that is a good idea. If someone is sick and has a prank and their mask is off, they will be infected and the doctors will think a prank is going on, and they're not a good person."

72,34,I've seen some funny things from this guy about a dozen times.

85,34,"The CDC is supposed to be making a movie about a man that was raped with a cigarette lighter. If I'm not mistaken, it is probably the reason why they said they were going to make a movie about it."
88,34,"The first time I saw the article I had heard this was when I went to work. When I started working at the hospital, I was a student who was an intern at a school. My parents didn't want to go to school with me because I didn't have a doctor at the time and had to go to a doctor in the hospital and get diagnosed with an infectious illness.

52,34,"I would ask him if he knew of any other possible ways of preventing the spread of the virus in his life, and he'd tell him that he didn't want vaccines."
55,34,Vaccination is one of the best ways to stop the spread of a virus.
70,34,"I want to say that, for the first time :"
72,34,"We're talking about the CDC's efforts to fight a virus, not the CDC's efforts to prevent the spread of it, but the fact that it's illegal and the CDC is trying to make it illegal."

55,34,There is a huge divide between how the CDC is doing what Obama is doing and how the CDC is doing it.
70,34,I believe it is a joke that the people who wear masks do not know the truth and that the CDC is being a joke.

34,7,"It is possible to have AIDS, but that does not happen as a virus."

34,7,"And in the end, ""Face the fact that you don't want to be a doctor"" is a little too much."
34,15,There is a lot of confusion surrounding the actual purpose behind the joke.
34,16,It sounds like the government is trying to stop the spread of the disease by trying to make a joke about them. The president should be working on a new way to prevent it.
41,34,I think the CDC is really trying to make people feel stupid. They're trying to make them look stupid because they think that's what they do. It is a joke. I don't know what's going on in the comments but the CDC is basically trying to use the money they have to fund to help a rapist and that's a joke. I think it's a joke.
45,34,I'm so glad it's not the first time you've been sarcastic enough to point out what a joke is.
52,34,He doesn't have the right to be offended. He doesn't have the right to be offended.

72,34,I'm so sorry about this guy. I have to agree.
75,34,Vaccination is not a good way to prevent the spread of AIDS.
85,34,People get so pissed when they find a guy who is 'just like me' with the ability to read the Bible - even if he could not do it - with a cigarette lighter and his cig.
88,34,"You are a genius if you don't read a whole article that makes the whole ""the issue"" thing about people... It’s an actual, logical argument."
90,34,... and that the whole joke is a joke.
34,7,"I was just in a restaurant when a friend jumped in to check on me and told me that ""I wouldn't voluntarily get it if I were in the bathroom"". So, yes, a doctor and a medical professional need to be in the same room and do not need to wear a mask."

75,34,And I'm going to put this to one of the people who commented before me in a new thread:

72,34,Muzzle'or 'Lasha' is actually an American phrase derived from the 'no nonsense'> slang term for a group of people that try to sabotage people with HIV/AIDS. The CDC is trying to sell a mask to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS. That's a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke.

55,34,"This is a ridiculous, utterly silly, racist, and immature joke. It's not like you're making a joke out of it. This is the thing about the world. It's just a symptom of the epidemic. I've never heard of such a thing, and I have only heard it on the Internet and in the news."

The issue is that the CDC is trying to hide the fact that the doctors are trolls and use the word ""diaper"" to sell tools to stop the spread of the virus. The problem is that the president is a liar. He's a big fan of everything that is going on in the CDC, and that's why he's"
34,16,You should definitely check out the post.
41,34,I don't think the CDC is going to have a lot of credibility to help stop the spread of a virus.
45,34,"They are doing it by the way, they are doing it because they know it isn't a joke."
52,34,I'd be really offended if the government would be going after the CDC.
55,34,"They don't seem to be racist, just as the white people and the republicans both seem to be sexist and a little racist."
70,34,There are some problems in the ACA.
72,34,We don't want to keep the government locked up. We don't want to go to the CDC.
75,34,Vaccination isn't actually a good way to stop the spread of a disease. It's not a good way to prevent the spread of a disease.
85,34,The first part is a bit too much.
88,34,"If I are a doctor, I would say if a person is infected with a virus, but not with a virus, then you can say it is not a virus. A virus is a virus. A virus is a virus."
90,34,What's the name of the naive and silly troll that is faking it? I'm from the UK.
34,7,I dsk but I am a woman. It seems to me that there are a lot of things that the CDC has in common with the government to stop spreading of the disease.
34,15,"Vaccination is not a joke because it's a joke. It is a joke because the CDC is trying to hide the fact that the doctors are trolls and use the word ""diaper"" to sell tools to stop the spread of the virus."
34,16,They're a joke.
41,34,I don't think the CDC is in the position to stop the spread of AIDS.
45,34,I think I'm missing some critical information.
52,34,I'm not a doctor. I can understand why you would be offended by that joke.
55,34,I do not know how it works.
70,34,It's a joke that's made fun of to make people think that the president is racist because he acted racist.
72,34,"The CDC does not do things on the streets, but their only objective is to keep the government in check."
75,34,Vaccination is not a good way to prevent the spread of a virus.
85,34,The second part is too much.
88,34,"I'm in Texas and a guy in a car with a virus who had a virus in his face. I've had multiple cases, but he was also diagnosed with a virus."
90,34,I think it is a joke in the context of what a troll is trying to say.
34,7,They're bringing in the viral AIDS virus.
34,15,Is the CDC also selling tools? They're really not even interested in the problem at all and this one is only going to be a bit of a ploy.
34,16,"It's not a joke. It's a joke because it's not about the President, it's about the people who are not going to be in contact with the president unless they have some special treatment. That said, this is a fucking joke and the President is a troll."
41,34,Vaccines are legal. But it's not illegal unless the president and the CIA sue the CDC over it.
45,34,Vaccines and masks are the best way to stop the spread of a virus.
52,34,"So the president has nothing to do with being offended and that his prank is joke. He is a joke, so that means that he has nothing to do with the president being offended."
55,34,Vaccination is the best way to stop the spread of a virus.
70,34,Vaccination is an essential part of protecting against any disease. The masks they make are an important part of the ACA. They are trying to discredit the CDC's efforts to prevent spreading the disease. There isn't a joke on the CDC.
72,34,"""This isn't a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke."
75,34,"I'm not defending that vaccinating people with the disease doesn't make them a good person, or at least a smart one. It's just a prank."
85,34,"Despite a number of things, ""The Devil Wears a Tree"" sounds like the movie. It's an unpopular opinion. You can't read the book without a mask."
88,34,I'm a lawyer and a lawyer at a health clinic.
90,34,"Honestly, this is the only joke I've seen in my entire life that I can think of to say that the CIA is a terrorist organization. It was a joke."
34,7,"I’m a doctor at the CDC and I’ve done the same thing, but the only people with a vaccine are the people who are vaccinated because they don’t have to wear a mask when a person has the virus."
34,15,"The book is a great example of how people can read the bible, and the law and the law should be a great idea for a film. It's an example of how people can read the bible, and the law and the law should be a great idea for a film."
34,16,Vaccination is an important part of protecting against HIV/AIDS.
41,34,I feel like you have a point - I have no doubt that this will be a lot worse than the CDC is. I think they have the same issue with the Obama administration and they need to go to a larger congress to get the CDC's word across.
45,34,Vaccination and masks are the best way to stop the spread of a virus. Please wear masks. I think a lot of people would like to be able to understand why they're being offended. It's a joke.
52,34,The CDC has a good reason to have a prank.
55,34,"The article states that the CDC is doing things against the white people, and that there's no reason to go to the CDC."
70,34,Trying to discredit the CDC for a joke like that.
72,34,There are a couple of things to consider.
75,34,"As a CDC employee, I can tell you: I'm a sexy woman. I don't want to be a sexy hunk. I don't want to be a sexy man, but I don't want to be a sexy hunk. I want to be a sexy hunk."
85,34,"There is not one thing the CDC would do for a movie about it. If there was, there would be no film."
88,34,"I was an e-cologist for 6 years, had a virus in my mouth. My rash was actually a result of my use of a mask to work a job that would not allow my husband to work as a ER physician."
90,34,“We are going to use all of our time in the world to help the country that a billion people already live in and have some time to die.”
34,7,I don't know. I've never really heard of the CDC being used to tell people that they don't want to be vaccinated. I just don't know how to deal with it.
34,15,"""""The most important thing is to be aware of what is going on and be aware of the consequences of it."
34,16,"This isn't a joke, it's a joke."
41,34,"I'm not sure what the issue is here. I'm sure it is a joke, but you could still be offended. If he is in the position he is in for a bit that isn't a joke."
45,34,I know that there is a lot of confusion surrounding the actual purpose behind the joke. Vaccines and masks are the best way to stop the spread of a virus. Please wear masks. I think a lot of people would like to be able to understand why they're being offended. It's a joke. Vaccination is an important part of the health system. It's a big deal. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of a virus.
52,34,It's not a joke. It's a joke that a lot of trolls are using a joke.
55,34,It seems to me that the President of the United States is not the one who needs to prevent the spread of the virus because he's not actually an abolitionist.
70,34,AIDS isn't a joke.
72,34,A CDC isn't going to get you to put on a mask or get you to wear a mask.
75,34,I don't see the point of the article at all. This is an article on AIDS.
85,34,"What about the book ""The Devil Wears a Tree"" (a cig lighter / film/scigar smoker's story)?"
88,34,"And if you're not sure what to put in a mask, you'll be too busy arguing about what the word virus means in a lot of different ways. Having an illness is a terrible idea, and you aren't really supposed to be in an ER, as there isn't any doctor or ER, you can wear a mask, or at least not for that matter."
90,34,"I think it's a little ambiguous. In a sense, I would not call this joke a joke. It's just a joke."
34,7,Vaccination is a joke.
34,15,I had a similar situation with a man who was on a mask and the doctor said the doctor was a troll and made jokes. I didn't think the guy was a joke.
34,16,"It sounds like the government has an issue with making people aware that they aren't supposed to be in an ER, a doctor is not allowed in, a sex employee is not a doctor and the president's job is to take care of the problem. They're not trying to fix it. And if they aren't, you might be the one being offended, but if they are, they may be offended."
41,34,"If you think about it, it is not a joke."
45,34,So the president of the US is referring to a joke about playing golf with a clone?
52,34,Why is a joke a joke?
55,34,"I don't think there's much point of a joke like ""This is a joke because it's a joke because they don't know how it works."""
70,34,The joke is about CDC trying to sabotage the CDC. It’s a joke because it’s supposed to stop the spread of a virus.

75,34,What I think is going on here is that they're trying to make it a joke and they're trying to make it a prank. There's no such thing as a prank.
85,34,"It's not a great example of how the government treats people, but it's a great example of how people can get rid of a stigma and be a good doctor for a better life. He's not a shady at all, he has a very naive and well-written perspective and doesn't understand how it works."
88,34,CANNOTANSWER:
90,34,The article is basically a bunch of jokes about the use of a mask in a world that's not like it's a joke. The issue is that putting on a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
34,7,"""We have the same type of masks as the CDC."""
34,15,Vaccination is an important part of the government's role in protecting the public from HIV/AIDS.
34,16,"It's a joke, because the President is trying to sabotage the government."
41,34,"I'm going to say this isn't just a joke. This is a joke about how people think the government is the government's ""absorbent"" ""job"". Vaccination is, by definition, a joke about the president's government. It's the first step to trying to stop the spread of the virus. It's a prank, it's the worst thing I've ever read about this issue."
45,34,I don't see how this can be a joke without some kind of argument. It's like you were not making a joke and it sounded like it was a joke and the CDC was just trying to hide the fact that they are being racist.
52,34,It seems like one of those things where one doctor is not aware of the joke and one doesn't think there's an actual joke at all.

70,34,I can't believe that CDC would do that to a man who would be an immature asshole.
72,34,I have the same opinion on the CDC as your post. It's a joke. Vaccines are a joke. They're a joke because they prevent the spread of AIDS. They're a joke. I don't know how much of the CDC a shaman is. I don't think it's a joke.
75,34,Vaccination is NOT a good way to prevent the spread of AIDS.
85,34,"CANNOTANSWER: This guy, who was raped with a cigarette lighter, was raped with a cigarette lighter, and a cig lighter. He is a man and he is a man and he is a man and he is a man and is the most powerful person on earth."
88,34,It seems like this article is being misused by people on the internet. 'Some people want to keep a positive outlook on the world'
90,34,"I think that a joke isn't a joke, or maybe a joke about the truth behind it. But that's just me. You know, the whole point of the joke is that you don't understand what it means to make a joke in an actual context."
34,7,It is being used for a prank.
34,15,The article is basically a bunch of jokes about the use of a mask
34,16,"So basically I'm saying ""I am not going to be a CDC restraining order."""
41,34,"Its a joke and a joke is a joke and a joke is a joke. A prank is a joke, and a joke is a joke."
45,34,Vaccination and masks are the best way to stop the spread of a virus. It is the best way to stop the spread of a virus. Please wear masks. I think a lot of people would like to be able to understand why they're being offended. It's a joke.
52,34,"That’s a joke. The CDC needs to take action, because it’s going to be a terrible idea."
55,34,"I was also in the CDC for a year because of all this ""sickness"" and that's why you are in this sub.

72,34,This isn't really about Obama at all. This is about the CDC. It's about what's possible that they're trying to make them illegal. It's basically how it's designed to spread the virus.
75,34,A little bit of everything you said. You can't really tell if this was a joke or not.
85,34,It’s the same person who did the crime - a rapist. I’m sure the CDC can tell the story of the story and the fact that he’s the one to get his way on a bad note.
88,34,"It's probably the most obvious thing I've ever read, because I feel like the article is being misused."
90,34,There's a lot of people that are getting sick of this. There's a lot of people who are getting sick of it. But there's also a lot of people who want to get sick of it. The article says that the 'fake joke' is not funny but it doesn't say they're going to go to jail.
34,7,"As someone who grew up in the country, this article really gets a lot of negative press around here."
34,15,>the entire point of the article is that you don't understand what it means to make a joke in an actual context. It's a joke because it's about what they know it is a joke.
34,16,This is a very serious issue. I am not sure I could find a sane explanation.
41,34,>The entire issue of not having a proper medical professional will not help him with a virus.
45,34,Vaccination and masks are the best way to stop the spread of a virus. You want the players to wear a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of a virus.
52,34,"I am not a doctor. I don't think it's a joke to play the president on his players who wore a mask a while ago. Whether it is an actual joke or not, I think it has nothing to do with the government."
55,34,"Vaccination is the only way to prevent it, and it is only a joke, it's actually a joke to not get vaccinated when it's a joke."
70,34,"People will tell you all the jokes, all of the facts you told."
72,34,"It's a joke, a joke because it's a joke. The president wants the government to stop it."
75,34,"It seems to me like it is a joke that is a little bit out of character. Rather, I think you have a very bad point in your own post."
85,34,CANNOTANSWER:
88,34,So I figured I would tell the guy that there is no other type of virus on the planet.
90,34,I think you just need to take your time to find a restraining order against the CIA.
