38,11,"If they actually tried to protect you and you were allowed to go, they should have been more concerned about the safety of your teammates and coaches."
38,18,i am not a doctor but i feel bad for my teammates and myself. it does not make my kids more comfortable or safer. my coach has not seen that happen for 10 years now.
38,23,"I have been in that position as well and I can confirm it is one of the most important points on the job. I was pretty close to losing my job because of the mask, but i'm sorry but i'm just gonna take my helmet off for the twitchcon masks."

40,38,"Well you are right that this is one of the stupidest things I have ever done in my entire life. There's nothing i can say about it, and I don't really understand why I would be mad if someone was wearing a mask."
58,38,"Thats the morality of that piece of legislation. The other thing is, that's not the right way to do that. If she was ok, and we didn't get a deal, the first thing she did was fuck the president for saying it, but now it's just like a trick."
59,38,"Then, as a result, I'm looking for something to do. But, you can do it. But, I'm really bad at that, because in my state the states make no mandatory mandatory wear to wear a helmet, just because it's not an adult, doesn't mean the sport can't provide such a thing, and the players have no obligation to wear a mask."
62,38,It's an anti-virus measure and it's the same as putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt.

38,11,"What? I’ve had a lot of bad experiences with coaches, the safety of my own family, and how this is all down to them. I’ve got a pretty serious phobia of my own team, and I’m always at work and can’t stand a guy with a mask on. I’m never going to leave. My team does not look like they have the right to wear a mask. It’s just not that easy to use a mask on someone that carries a virus that cannot be a helmet."
38,18,You have to agree with my own position that wearing a mask is a bad idea. I don't know if you have to agree with me on that but that's pretty much the definition of a bad person and a bad person.
38,23,"I'm not gonna stop summing up your comment, but if you are. This post is over and I have no idea why that's on the front page."
38,27,This is not a hockey player. Its a soccer player with a mask.

62,38,"I haven't used a mask and I just can't seem to get one off, so I won't wear one."
64,38,"I have a lot of personal experiences with this subject. It was my first time doing it for a while but it didn't really go well. I did find out a while back that it was very tame, and it took a while for my ad sunk. It's kind of like it was just a lot of shit."
72,38,"The most important thing to consider about all of these are the ones that don't say ""Madness is good for you"" as in ""I don't think I need to wear a mask, because I need to wear something good for you""."
73,38,A lot of people have already commented that they're starting to get sick and don't think to change their masks. I've noticed that wearing a mask makes you look more tired than a normal person.

38,36,I believe this is just a joke.
40,38,>We have the same rights as people in other parts of the world and we have to get them.
58,38,"You fucked up. I can't imagine what the Obama administration is doing. I see a lot of people in there who might think that putting on a mask would stop the spread of the virus. So the fact that she's not wearing a mask, or maybe not actually trying to get the president out of there a way to prevent it is a little funny, but if you really think the government is a good candidate to get that away with, let's just look at the fact that they're not a good candidate."
59,38,"A friend of mine told me that one of my best friends had a really weird face tattoo that he would do in public. He didn't even bother to wash it. I didn't care, he did whatever he wanted. I think he was a good guy."

64,38,">I'm so sorry for the fucking story. It is sad that there are so many masks in the military, I work as a medical director for a medical organization in the United States and they are an official company. I want to go through the paperwork for this and try to find out how to stop a cough in the emergency rooms. I was very lucky to get a second job in the military at age 35 and was able to continue to make a living. I was very lucky to get a second job"
72,38,"If the people are being treated like children by the government, the government has a right to prevent the spread of a virus."
73,38,Vaccinating against the virus is the best way to prevent this. Please wear masks.

85,38,"The best thing about the Internet is the ability to read a person's personal life. A lot of these are not a good idea, but they're not cheap either.

It's frightening how dumb they think all of is. Little blue ones are"
86,38,"What you mean is I'm sorry OP, but I’m not the one who wrote this."
88,38,Is he really trying to make a point of what a mask is? Because you are clearly unsure what the other person is talking about.
38,3,What's the point of a mask?
38,11,"I haven’t seen that film, though. There was a comment somewhere about the government’s attempt to prevent the spread of the virus, not the military itself. It was pretty funny."
38,18,"It's not just a joke, it's a fact. That's where it gets to be done."
38,23,They will have to make some changes to stop the spread of this.
38,27,The article is about a guy who wears masks on his face in the office. Apparently the guy wasn't supposed to use it on him when he came in.
38,32,"You mean the guy who wrote ""Little blue ones are totally useless."" Then why don't you go read the entire Wikipedia article and read the entire article for yourself."
38,35,"There are plenty of things that aren't about the dangers of a mask. Especially because of all the smoke, it's not as harmless as wearing a mask. Hopefully the health insurance companies will be able to take you there to protect yourself."
38,36,Is it true that the only time you can tell someone you don't want to get a new job is with a real-life military physician?
40,38,>Was wearing a mask part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.Vaccines will also be the way to go. I think the question here is how can a person with boosters not wear a mask and not go anywhere without one?
58,38,I do not know why you're being downvoted to hell but you're right that putting on a mask is offensive and that it doesn't stop the spread of the virus. There is a very big problem with that. And I think there is something to be said for a reason. I'm sure many people here have a good understanding of why they think the president is being obnoxious and offensive.
59,38,"This is part of a long-standing conversation with a group of apes (the minority of whom are on the other side of the aisle), where the government is invading their homeland and attacking their own people."
62,38,"""Mallets are a way for people to walk to the grocery store without being struck or beaten"""
64,38,"So I'm going to assume that this guy has a serious issue with that if he is in his 40s. I'm not sure how he is going to understand the ""silly"" part of the question."
72,38,He is trying to get the CDC to re-certify that all people who are not aware of the vaccinations have them and they do not have to wear them. They are just attempting to help the public.
73,38,I think the biggest scam is: they are being sarcastic about it.
76,38,">Hey, I'm a criminal that's a criminal. You might be a little naive to think that you're a fraud, but that doesn't mean that your actions are inherently evil."
85,38,This guy sounds so silly as to have to think about it. Certainly I’m interested to learn his own story.
86,38,It's not the first time that I've read a post about this. The reason for it was because people think the first paragraph of a post was wrong. I'm glad you're not being that nasty to someone who wants to bring you to the point where you should try to get to the point where you don't think they'll get to the point that they are going to be able to get to a point where the real issue is not the mask.
88,38,"My friend is a nurse and has been having a hard time breathing in two weeks. She used to be an emergency pulmonary patient. But her doctor was more concerned that it would be the virus, which caused her to suffer a major hiccup and had to have a professional therapist examine her condition to diagnose her condition. She told me she was being treated like she was being treated like an idiot. She has been in the hospital for nearly three months now, and it’s been worse for me. My family knows I’ve been using a mask for two years and they think it’"

38,11,"They are trying to prevent the spread of a virus so they need to do it before it goes on. I’m not saying that it is the government’s stance to stop it, but it does seem like it does."

40,38,This is just a fucking rooster. I mean the people who get vaccinated wear masks all the time. That is why I'm not even gonna put on a mask.
58,38,">That's probably why it's not funny. Until now, you've been making it sound like you've been trying to get an answer to the question of who wants to be president. You don't need to see the president for any more than a brief moment to find out if he is trying to get rid of the president's mask."
59,38,"I've always found it hard to believe that the government is invading your nation because of the government'religious actions'. In fact, as a result of the government invading their nation, I'd rather be the narcissist, or a terrorist who is going to be a dick."
62,38,"It is an anti-virus measure, and it is what it is. So I'm not sure what the whole point of a mask is."
64,38,"In the end, I would rather have a doctor who would take me to a doctor to talk with a virus expert than a doctor with medical experience with a virus that has been diagnosed as being deadly."
72,38,Why not wear a mask to prevent the spread of a virus?
73,38,I'm going to put a joke on it.
76,38,"It's not just a fraud, it's an illegal offense. The government has a plan to keep the people who've died from a virus at their own risk, a scheme to prevent it from happening. The problem is the government doesn't want people that are sick with the virus living there. They have to use other methods to protect the people who have been infected."
85,38,I think the second part of the book is very well done and has a lot of good points about the CDC and how a mask works. I think it's worth a read.
86,38,">The whole point is to get your life out of that state and get out of that situation as quickly as possible. You're a jerk, the fact that you're being downvoted doesn't help. It's because she wasn't being held accountable for the shit that she did. This is not normal behavior. It is not a virus. It is a virus."

38,11,"i think that in this particular scenario, they're essentially trying to make the mask more attractive to people who have been infected and you should be able to avoid it. but the op is really defending a stance of government ccb in a political arena and you're just saying that's not really their business."
38,18,People who are uninvited are often infected by other viruses. That's why I'm not gonna put on a mask.

72,38,They're merely attempting to prevent the spread of the virus by allowing people to get them. Ingraham is trying to prevent people from getting HIV. It's not just about a scam. It's a scam.

59,38,It's not like the government lied to them. It just seems like the guy is trying to make money. It's like some kind of shit.
62,38,I don't know what the NSA is doing or what their mandates are - they're making a point about the government trying to impede the spread of a virus. If they don't want to do it they are going to have to shut down the FDA and the CDC. This is a case in point.

59,38,"Vaccination isn't ""tough"" and isn't a restraining order."
62,38,They've already had a talk with the NSA and the FDA about their plans to ban it. It's hard to imagine how a CIA spy might go about that.
64,38,Isn't that the part of being a medical director for a medical organization that's just a bunch of people that get the benefit of a mask that they wear and just have the chance to tell a person they have a problem with. This would be a lot more helpful for them to have in mind when they get sick or sick and have to be vaccinated.
72,38,"Its a joke that is not a joke, and you can not believe how much better it sounds, you can just be happy you got vaccinated and go to the CDC instead of the CDC."

88,38,That's the whole point of my post.
38,3,"It doesn't make sense, as I've seen all of the comments, including this one, just because of it. It's also not as easy as you think it is. And the only reason it's even a joke is because it's a joke."
38,11,"I’m not a doctor, and I am a doctor. I can help you."

38,35,That's crazy. You suck at it.
38,36,CANNOTANSWER: The CDC and the US government are promoting vaccines that are supposed to stop the spread of the virus.
40,38,I can't say whether this is a true truth or a lie. There are far worse things on the internet.
58,38,"It's not that hard to explain how a virus can spread across your body, so you have to put on a mask in order to be vaccinated."
59,38,> I'm glad that your comments weren't funny.
62,38,"There is a whole world out there about how ""unclean"" is a word? The government isn't going to allow anyone with any sort of public health status to wear it. Apparently it's illegal to do so."
64,38,"It is sad that there are so many masks in the military, I work as a medical director for a medical organization in the United States and they are an official company. I want to go through the paperwork for this and try to find out how to stop a cough in the emergency rooms. I’ve been here, a few days ago, and the first part of my story makes me feel very ashamed of myself. I’ve always wondered why someone would say they’re allergic to a virus when they have some. Vaccination is supposed to be a step in the right direction to stop"
72,38,Why don't people go to the CDC. We can help.
73,38,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. When we all talk about vaccines it is pretty clear that the players and the medical staff are being scummy and don't really care.
76,38,"That's right. If you’re a criminal, don’t wear a mask."
85,38,I don't know the author but I do know that a lot of sarcasm is implied because it is the first book I read. I know that the movie would be based on his books.

64,38,Is there a good reason not to get vaccinated in the military?
72,38,"The CDC is a very powerful oligarch, and it's on the front page of every social media forum, as well as the US media."
73,38,It's not a joke because the government is manipulating it.
76,38,They're using the restraining order to stop the spread of a virus. There are ways to stop the spread of a virus if you're aware of the restraining order. They want to re-enforce it. You CAN get vaccinated for a virus and your privacy is protected.

38,32,"I'd love to see what this guy's answer was, but in the context of the article, it seemed ambiguous. It is probably an attempt to avoid a lot of discussion. It sounds like he just was trying to justify a position he thought was stupid. But to be able to address it with a reasonable response is a ridiculous statement. I'm just saying it isn't about the CDC but the whole nonsense and nonsense they're trying to portray it in."

59,38,This is a snarky piece of shit that you could not agree to but that's why I feel like it's ridiculous.

85,38,I've always been a fan of Tim Curry.
86,38,The CDC didn't grant a government restraining order. That's what's supposed to be the problem in the United States. CDC also had a problem in the US. It's not the president's job to stop the spread of a virus. It's a troll trying to get his message across.

38,35,The article says that the CDC and the US government are promoting vaccines that are supposed to stop the spread of the virus. They are making a huge push to recertify the protection of people who are not aware of them.
38,36,This guy is a troll trying to get his message across.
40,38,It's not about the government. It's about the federal government. The government is trying to make a joke about it. You don't know what it's about. It's about trying to avoid people from getting a virus.
58,38,I was able to put on a mask and not see it because I was able to put on a mask. It's called a mask. The real question is what should the president wear? Because I am a sexist guy and it's not a great idea.
59,38,"Those aren't very good suggestions, but they're very valid."
62,38,I think you are right about this. The government is trying to stop this by calling him a troll.
64,38,The CDC is probably a little too crappy on it's part because the government is so incompetent.

They put on it to keep the infection from spreading. So they told her it was a virus in the end. That's why she is going to"

86,38,I am a Republican. But I have read this a few times.
88,38,"The article is absolutely hilarious. It's a great thing people have written about the aversion to wearing a mask because it is a bad idea, and it doesn't have the power to actually make a point. The whole article is about the aversion to wearing a mask, and they are being naive."
38,3,This guy has no right to wear a mask. The problem is that people can't stop the spread of the virus. He is a medical doctor. And I don't think he's racist because they don't know what a mask is and what a mask isn't.
38,11,"I have a mask a lot of the time. But I was wearing one on when I was playing football, it's a terrible thing."

58,38,"The NSA has been around for the last 4 years. In this case, they are only making a joke about the Vaccine."
59,38,">As an American who's gotten vaccinated for HIV/VHC, I don't think sex is a problem, that's why you have to wear a mask."
62,38,"I don't know that this was an original reply, but it's really quite the opposite of what the doc said. In the US, the NSA can ban a mask on a civilian, if the victim doesn't want to. So while you could say it's a good idea, I don't think you are a moron, but you do have a valid point."
64,38,Vaccination is a good thing in the military.Is it a joke?
72,38,"I know this is very popular, but in the US it doesn't mean you have to wear a mask to stop a virus. It means they have a right to prevent and control the spread."
73,38,It's pretty clear that the players and the medical staff are being scummy and don't really care. The ACA is an effective way to prevent the spread of the virus. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of the virus. Please wear masks.
76,38,He said that she can't even put on a mask in her body to prevent infection and he will have to live in quarantine to prevent spread of a virus. Those are the only things that could be covered.
85,38,"It doesn't matter what the authors are doing, just that the author is trying to make a movie. Those people are just going to think like this, and it won't make the movie. The fact that he's using his mask to make a movie shows that he's trying to make a movie."
86,38,I think the point is that they need to get the CDC to stop her from putting on a mask.
88,38,"There are a lot of people in the world who wear a mask because they feel like they are the only one who will get it. It's actually pretty good, and I have seen a few people wear it but I don't have any idea how much that is dangerous."
38,3,"There's an article about the CDC, which is a joke, but has no source."
38,11,"I'm a doctor and I'm not a doctor, but I'm a doctor."
38,18,... and I don't think the NSA is a prankster.
38,23,It's the anti-semitism of the '70s and '80s that are threatening to make Americans sick. It isn't about being sick and it's not about stopping people from getting sick.
38,27,You can't stop people from getting sick. But you can prevent venomous rashes from your face.
38,32,The article is a prank.
38,35,I hate to think it's a joke but I am happy they are doing something like this.
38,36,"This is a very common mistake. In other words, you can't have sex with someone without a mask. It's a terrible idea, but a mask is a very dangerous and dangerous thing to do.

59,38,"> In this post, you are being implying that the CDC is an anti-vaccine force, and in fact a very large conspiracy theory. This is all a joke, and a scam."
62,38,The government is trying to stop people from doing something they don't want to.
64,38,I think this is a pretty cool article. You are clearly a guy who isn't sure what his father thought or did or could've been.
72,38,I think it has to do with a lot of the things that you have said.
73,38,"""... wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
76,38,Vaccination is the only solution in the current political climate. The government is just trying to help stop the spread of a virus.

86,38,"There's a reason the CDC did not grant a government restraining order, and it's really not an issue."
88,38,"There is an old saying on r/legaladvice/ that it's a terrible idea to wear a mask to prevent the spread of a virus. And it seems like he thinks he has an aversion, but isn't convinced the whole thing is about it."

58,38,There is a difference between putting on a mask and going out with a doctor.
59,38,Is this why my mother and sister have to wear masks? They're so weird.
62,38,"I'm not talking about the NSA, but I'm talking about the government, in general. The ""fake mask"" is a joke about a national security threat. It could be dangerous."
64,38,"Vaccination is a great tool for the population. I'm not sure what the government is trying to ""reproduce"" something, or is that something they need to do?"

40,38,"If they are not getting the vaccines, that's not a prank. The CDC and the CIA are helping spread the virus. It is a joke, but that's not the point."

The government has a history of causing the spread of disease. They've done it a lot to prevent it. They don't care about the people in the military because of their health and safety. And they don't care because of how they use the vaccines. I'm not sure how this was a joke."

40,38,>I don't think the CDC is an anti-vaccination force. They're a troll company. They have no obligation to enforce health care laws. They don't support the government and they have no moral obligation to enforce them. Vaccination is a crucial part of the healthcare system.
58,38,Why do people think that the Obama administration is trying to stop the spread of the virus?
59,38,This is why I don't want to be a doctor or have to go get vaccinated or to have sex with people with the virus?
62,38,It's so hard to imagine how a CIA spy would get the job. The CIA is going to be forced to shut down the FDA and the CDC.
64,38,"Vaccination isn't a joke, it's a good idea to prevent the spread of disease. The government has a history of causing the spread of disease. They don't care about the people in the military because of their health and safety. And they don't care because of how they use the vaccines."

38,36,So your a criminal. The problem is the government doesn't want people that are sick with the virus living there. They have to use other methods to protect the people who have been infected.
40,38,This is a joke. He is doing the right thing. You are being racist.

72,38,I was reading this as someone who wasn't aware of this joke.
73,38,I can say with some certainty that 'I'm a coach' doesn't even make sense and that the joke is about something I'm not sure about.
76,38,"Vaccination is an important part of our health system. I'm afraid that a government restraining order can be enforced against people who are infected, and not those who do not, because that is not one of the most common and most widespread anti-vaccination strategies for this country."

88,38,The article is about the aversion to wearing a mask. This is about a lot of people and the reason they aren't interested in it.

40,38,Well... it's a lot harder to put on a mask and still have a prank on the government.
58,38,People are making a joke about putting on a mask to prevent the spread of AIDS - the issue is not in itself a joke but is still a joke based on the CDC's own statement - a joke based on the Obama administration's statements about it (which are very arbitrary) - which is not a joke.
59,38,"If you are a white man and are trying to be a racist, that's not a joke."
62,38,"This is a good joke, but I don't see how the President wants to stop it if he doesn't do it."
64,38,"I thought it was a joke, and I think that's what the wording is supposed to mean. It's not like I like a lot of people saying that a joke is a joke. In the context of the ACA the CDC has a history of being wrong, a lot of things that can be interpreted as a joke. The CDC has a history of being wrong, a lot of things that can be interpreted as a joke. The government has no reason to be on the receiving end of the ACA."
72,38,You are the CDC. It doesn’t work and a CDC does not want the public fuck to have access to vaccines and the CDC doesn’t want the government to treat citizens like children.
73,38,"Vaccination is a joke and you need to be vaccinated, it is not. It is a joke, it isn't a joke, and it isn't a joke. The CDC should be ashamed of the truth that a vaccine is ineffective against that shit. I think the only way to prevent it is to make vaccine. The only thing that's a joke is that the CDC is going to take the ACA out. They won't do that unless the CDC needs to vaccinate every team."
76,38,Is that a problem with a virus?
85,38,"I would love to see this movie as a movie and a documentary on how the government uses masks to get a response. It's really good, but a lot of people don't have it."
86,38,It's not a good idea to try to shut the virus down - it's a problem in the US. The issue is in the fact that it is a good idea to try to block it and make it stop.
88,38,"I'm assuming the original comment would have been 'No, it's a virus'? Because I don't think it would have made much sense for the author to make the statement that it's a virus. A virus is an actual virus. But I think the implication is that the article is a bit misleading."

59,38,"This is an extreme version of the ""horrible snarky "" part. The joke is an attempt to make us look bad."
62,38,"AIDS is a pretty serious issue in America, it can affect the whole population. There is a lot of stigma attached to the AIDS epidemic, which is why it's so important."
64,38,It's really not a joke at all.
72,38,"Are you kidding me? If they have no reason to deny you any access to vaccines to avoid their hysteria, and are not aware they would prevent you from getting HIV, and they are very likely to do this by letting you have a test in case the test gets contaminated, and in their eyes are the best treatment of HIV/AIDS. I'm not suggesting that the CDC has a right to prevent infection, but it is the best way to stop the spread."
73,38,"I think it's about the vaccine being removed - not the vaccine itself, it's about the vaccine itself."
76,38,A lot of people believe that the restraining order is a sign that the government has been misled.
85,38,"What the article states about the movie is that the author did the research and made a film about the problem in the film. The idea is that the authors wanted to make a movie, but this isn't one."
86,38,"No, I'm not. Regardless of the restraining order, it isn't legal. It doesn't mean you shouldn't wear a mask. It means you should be able to keep yourself alive when you are sick. The restraining order means you can't put on a mask. The restraining order is a legal limitation on the wear of a mask."

38,3,The point of the article is that the man has no right to wear a mask in his office. The problem is that people can't stop the spread of the virus. It's not just about the CDC. They're promoting vaccines that are supposed to stop the spread of the virus. They're promoting vaccines that are supposed to stop the spread of the virus.

64,38,I grew up in the military. I'm not familiar with the ACA. The military has had some of the best programs for vaccines (including one with MMR). But I don't see why this is a joke at all.

86,38,Ingraham has a job of a medical assistant (the one he is the one who has the restraining order). She was working on a job that didn't allow her to wear the mask if she wanted.

64,38,Vaccination is a joke because it is a good thing for the nation and the military.
72,38,What is the point of wearing a mask? I don't want to be a joke.
73,38,I'm not sure what you mean by the joke being a joke. The joke that the CDC is a joke is that a doctor is a doctor who tries to make people vaccinated because their vaccinated person does not want the government to do it.
76,38,"[Don’t use the word fucking in this sentence, I used it to mean that it’s one of the dumbest things I’ve done in my entire life and i’ve done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things i ve done in my entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt "

38,18,"I mean, I think it is a joke, but the actual part is kind of an anti climactic joke, I don't think that it is a joke. I'm sure that is not a joke but rather a prank."
38,23,I'm sorry but I do have a feeling that the only reason this happened is because of a bad news article about the CDC.
38,27,CANNOTANSWER: I am not a doctor
38,32,I don't know if the CDC is suing you for it or not. I'm trying to figure out what kind of joke it is. It is not a joke.

38,36,"“When a joke is told, it's because that's exactly what it is.” (As in, the CDC is doing all the shit to bring down his ol' doctor because it's a joke, not a joke)."
40,38,There's no reason to think that the CDC is making a joke about this because they think that it is a joke about the CDC.
58,38,"I think you are missing the point. They are doing what they are supposed to do: ""shut up and come out with a joke about putting on a mask to prevent the spread of a virus."""
59,38,[This is an interesting discussion.
62,38,"CANNOTANSWER is a troll. He has no business knowing what a mask looks like. The NSA is making it all about ""why would anyone want to be an assistant at the NSA."" Apparently it's illegal to do so."

72,38,"""I'm curious to hear if it's an actual CIA agent that wears them. Vaccines are not allowed under federal regulations. Because I don't think that is a joke.

73,38,You’ve got to understand vaccinating against Zika.
76,38,So what’s the point of the restraining order?
85,38,The guy who wrote it. The title is not relevant. he didn't write it.
86,38,The restraining order is legal because it is against the basic basic right to health care.
88,38,A virus does not have to be a virus. Neither does a mask.
38,3,People in the US are trying to subsidize a shitload of products that are meant to prevent the spread of the virus and the spread of the AIDS vaccine. The CDC is trying to push this.
38,11,"The government is promoting an anti-viral vaccine, not a vaccine. It is not a joke. The CDC is trying to prevent the spread of a virus."
38,18,"The joke he is being racist about is not that there's something he's trying to convince the president that's racist. The article does a pretty good job of explaining how to prevent the spread of the virus in a funny, non-representative manner. But for the CDC, they are only doing it for the CIA to stop a virus. They're only doing the same thing to stop a virus, not the people who are trying to fight the virus."

76,38,The issue isn't the fact that he's a criminal. The problem is that he is a troll and he's going to want to be sued for using a restraining order against the president.

38,23,"This shit is very hard to do. The story, not the issue, is a joke."
38,27,"So I don't know why he's racist or anything, but the whole story is absurd."
38,32,CANNOTANSWER: It sounds like he just was trying to justify a position he thought was stupid. But to be able to address it with a reasonable response is a ridiculous statement.

64,38,A prank is the worst kind of joke if the ACA isn't a joke because it is a joke based on that nonsense.
72,38,Ingraham is not saying this to be a joke. He was referencing the CDC's attempt to prevent the spread of a virus.
73,38,Vaccination is a joke.
76,38,I didn't know that the word 'troll' is used by the CDC and 'trolls' aren't generally used by the government. So I wouldn't call that a troll if it was one of the most common crimes I've seen a lawyer deal with.
85,38,I like the title. It's about how the government treats people. But not the story of him.
86,38,What does that have to do with me?

38,36,'We need a new huddle.'
40,38,"If I'm not mistaken, the CDC is using the vaccines to stop the spread of syphilis. They're using them to prevent that."

64,38,"I'm not sure if the ACA is a joke, but I don't think the US government has a history of being right about how to deal with all of this."
72,38,">He is trying to get the CDC to re-certify that all people who are not aware of the vaccinations have them and they do not have to wear them. They are just attempting to help the public.', 'If the people are being treated like children by the government, the government has a right to prevent the spread of a virus.',"
73,38,"A lot of things seem to be funny about this, but I'd say it's a joke."

38,27,This isn't a joke. This is a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.
38,32,Vaccination is not a joke. It's a fact. It's a joke. But this prank is stupid and misleading. I'm sure the CDC's efforts to stop the spread of the disease will not be made up.
38,35,The CDC is trying to recertify that the CDC and the CIA are promoting vaccines that are supposed to stop the spread of the virus.
38,36,"It sounds like a joke, if I'm not wrong, that is a joke."

62,38,"Well, the government can sue him for anything that they think they do, including the CDC."
64,38,> The fact that they don't have any information on how the vaccines are working and how it prevents them from spreading spreads me just a little off-hand.
72,38,"Yes, this is a very well written piece."
73,38,"The joke's about the ACA being an effective way to stop the spread of the virus. It is a joke because it's not in the Constitution. It is a joke because it's illegal. It is a joke because it's in the Constitution. It is a joke because it isn't in the constitution. It is a joke because it is illegal. The truth is that vaccination is the only thing that is really shady, or any more controversial, in this country."
76,38,There is nothing you can do.
85,38,"I'm an avid reader. It's kind of funny how you say that, but it feels like you have a more sensible and respectful view of it."
86,38,"> Basically, it is legal to block a person from wearing a mask."

38,3,The thing is if someone is wearing a mask they are being raped by the CDC or a government.
38,11,"Honestly, the only thing that gets me is that the CDC is not allowed to say anything against the president and the administration. They can say anything they want about the president."
38,18,There isn't really anything on the Internet that makes it less funny than this article is making.
38,23,This is not a joke. This is a joke.
38,27,"'Vaccination is a joke' is just a title, if it's used as an introductory sentence, the entire article is an attempt to mislead the reader into thinking that the article was misleading."
38,32,"It's been a while, but I'm pretty sure the CDC is actually doing some shady shit, including trying to get them to remove the ACA and the vaccines."
38,35,"That is a pretty serious question. I'm gonna go ahead and read the article and take it from there, as it makes you understand that the CDC and the CIA are promoting vaccines that are supposed to stop the spread of the virus."
38,36,"I am going to be a doctor in three years, and we have a very important discussion to have about this as well."
40,38,Because they have no moral obligation to enforce the law. They have no obligation to have it enforced.
58,38,"I don't care why a President has a mask, but this is a joke."
59,38,CANNOTANSWER:
62,38,"So, in the context of the joke, the doctor should be given a piece of paper by his staff in the office, and he is supposed to show that he knows the best way to do it in the name of safety, and that he will go back to the CDC and sue him for what he says?"
64,38,The issue is that it's a prank and it's a joke.
72,38,">I know this is very popular, but in the US it doesn't mean you have to wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus.',"
73,38,No joke. Because it's a joke. Vaccination is the best way to stop the spread of the virus. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of the virus. Please wear masks.
76,38,"I don't know how it works, but the way the article is being constructed is a little odd and not quite right."
85,38,It's one of the worst movies ever made.
86,38,As someone who grew up in the US... You have an obligation to protect your husband if he's able to get him out of a life saver situation. In fact if he's in the right to stay with the CDC to prevent him from putting on the mask in the first place then he needs to be on guard and not be using a mask.
88,38,I think this is a great piece of advice.
38,3,CANNOTANSWER: Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
38,11,"I’m a doctor. I don’t want to be involved in the military, but I would love to know how to tell a story about how a medic can be in a position to fight the spread of a virus. My boyfriend lives here in NY and he doesn’t even know that it’s a virus."
38,18,I don't know what the president's opinion is.
38,23,"""We're going to have to pay for the ACA and vaccines. This is a joke."

38,32,"You need to have a conversation with Mr. White before this is a prank, because it's wrong, and the CDC should have a discussion with you before going through this with him. I'm sure there is a lot of conflict."
38,35,This guy is a pretty good ol's mcdonalds guy.
38,36,"""I know this is very popular, but in the US it doesn't mean you have to wear a mask to stop the spread of the virus."""
40,38,I don't think it's a prank.
58,38,"Vaccination is actually a joke that has been around for a long time and still is. We need to change the name so that it isn't just a joke. It's also not a joke, and it isn't going to stop the spread of the virus."
59,38,You are not being racist. This is a joke. The joke is a joke. The joke is an insult. It's not a joke. It's an insult. The joke is not a joke. The joke is a joke. The joke is an insult.
62,38,"That's right, because the President and the CIA are trying to sue for the AIDS epidemic. The CDC is trying to sue the CDC for preventing it. They're trying to sue him for trying to stop it."
64,38,The CDC has been right all along. And they are the ones that are going to get into trouble.
72,38,"If you are not going to change the CDC, you can't change the CDC."
73,38,The ACA is not a joke. It's not a joke. It's a joke because ACA is not a joke. The CDC is a joke because it's in the Constitution. It is a joke because the CDC is a joke. They aren't going to remove it.
76,38,Why do you think the NSA is a troll?
85,38,I think it's pretty good.
86,38,"I'd be a little overjoyed by the fact that this is a common situation. ""How did they get a restraining order?"""
88,38,"a viral is a virus, that's not a virus, but a virus."
38,3,>It’s hard to tell where people are.
38,11,"""We need to change the name so that it isn't just a joke."
38,18,Vaccination is not a joke. It is a joke. It is a joke. The CDC is promoting vaccines.
38,23,>“The ACA is actually a joke that has been around for a long time and still is. We need to change the CDC because it’s a joke.
38,27,"He said in the article that he wears a mask, not that he doesn't think it's racist. That he's going to get the CDC to pay for the ACA and vaccines. He's in a good position to ask questions about the CDC. He's probably a doctor, but it's not a joke."
38,32,The problem is that we have to be very careful about what is happening in our national security and healthcare systems.
38,35,I don’t understand how the author can’t be racist.
38,36,>I love coaching however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops.
40,38,I would be angry with people who are trying to make the prank a prank because of their own lack of empathy and respect. I do not think I'm a racist.
58,38,"No. ""Vaccination is an effective prevention of the spread of the virus."""
59,38,"A large conspiracy theory that is based on the CIA was created to try and spread a virus on a black person, while the CDC uses a'serious shit' to try to spread the virus to white people."
62,38,"This is not a joke. It is a joke, but it is making a point about how the government is trying to stop the spread of a virus. It is making a point about the government trying to stop the spread of a virus."
64,38,"You are a doctor, and the only person who can say that it's a joke is a doctor who is a doctor, not a doctor, no matter what it sounds like."
72,38,I don't think it's a joke.
73,38,>The truth is that vaccination is the only way to stop the spread of the virus.
76,38,Vaccination is a good way to end the epidemic and it's very dangerous and is not a good way to prevent it. Is it just something we can use to stop it?
85,38,"In the movie, I think I’ll read the book. I’m gonna read the movie."
86,38,This isn't a problem for the CDC. It's a problem because the CDC is trying to impose a restraining order on the people in that position.
88,38,"The title implies that they do not need to get a virus to live, but that they do not have to wear a mask to live, and this is why they wear it. A virus does not have to be a virus, but it has to be a virus. A virus is not a virus."

38,32,"In the end, I'm sure they could have made a joke out of it."
38,35,"I believe that this is because of the NSA trying to ""prevent"" the spread of the virus. If they don't take action to stop it, and try to stop the spread of it, it's no longer a joke and is just a joke."
38,36,I have been in the CDC for 10 years and still get the feeling that this is going to be a joke. I don't see why they are calling it that way.
40,38,The CIA and the CDC are making a joke about this.

85,38,I am so happy that you are having an honest discussion about this book.
86,38,Because I'm a Republican and this is why I don't post here.
88,38,I think the article is hilarious and not funny. It’s a good article and has a great sense of humor. It’s not about the actual subject matter. It’s about the real issue. I think it’s very interesting.
38,3,The people who haven't even heard of 'vaccinated' are being accused of not wearing the correct amount of makeup and not wearing a mask.

38,18,"It’s a joke. I don’t think they are doing that, but it’s a joke. They are doing it to protect the people, not the government."
38,23,I'm going to go ahead and tell you I'm just getting through this. This is the most stupid thing ever to come up with.
38,27,"I can see why it is a joke. Vaccination isn't a joke. It's an active vaccine. What if he isn't supposed to wear it on someone or wear a mask, or isn't supposed to use it on someone or something?"
38,32,>Winning a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
38,35,Vaccination is an essential part of the healthcare system. The government has a history of causing the spread of the virus. The CDC and the CIA are promoting vaccines that are supposed to stop the spread of the virus.

38,18,"The US government is taking the virus seriously, and making the health care reforms, but it doesn't help the problem."
38,23,This is a joke that does not make sense because the CDC and the CDC are trying to save americans. It’s a joke because it’s a joke.
38,27,I am not a doctor.
38,32,[An important point about CDC is that he is trying to make a joke. If you look into it I think it is probably a joke that he wants to stop and if you don't you should stop.
38,35,"You might also like the fact that this article is about people who haven't heard of ""vaccinated"" because of all the smoke — ""Especially because of all the smoke, it's not as harmless as wearing a mask."""
38,36,The CDC and the CDC is promoting vaccines that are supposed to stop the spread of the virus.
40,38,A prank is an idea. A joke is a prank. A prank is a joke. A prank is a fact.
58,38,Is there anything he did to get it out of the way?
59,38,My friends and I got sick from being a fucking white scumbag at the University of Michigan in 2009 because of an AIDS/AIDS vaccine.
62,38,They want to sue a doctor and the CDC for what they are trying to do.
64,38,I'd rather go through the paperwork for this and find out how to stop a cough in the emergency rooms.
72,38,The CDC and the CDC do not share the same interests as the CDC. They are not affiliated with any of them and it is their job to help prevent them from getting HIV.
73,38,Why do you need a mask? It's not a joke and the joke isn't about it. It's about the fact that it's illegal for the government to remove it.
76,38,"""...You can only protect their family and other infected people."
85,38,The movie is based off of the book and not the movie.
86,38,The point of the restraining order is to protect her. They aren't imposing them on a woman because he's using a mask.
88,38,I don't see anything wrong with the article.
38,3,"If the CDC wants to stop the spread of Zika, they should, too, implement some sort of medical safety policy for those who have not seen the virus or heard of it. This is what happens when it is used to promote vaccination."
38,11,"I'd be willing to bet that any other doctor with a mask is an afaik doctor. They are trying to prevent the spread of a virus by making the mask a joke. If they do not take care of the mask they'll take a call to the CDC, which in the past had been called the 'competitive'kind of joke, which in this case is called ""competitive"" and not 'competitive'. But if the CDC wants to change the name, they'll call him out as a joke"
38,18,Are the two options being the same?
38,23,The first is an actual joke.
38,27,I'm the only one who sucked it up because I'm a lawyer.
38,32,"""If I were in charge of the CDC and the NFL and did it as a joke, I would definitely be involved."""
38,35,The article is misleading because the author is implying that the CDC and the CIA are promoting vaccines that are supposed to stop the spread of the virus. Vaccination is an essential part of the healthcare system. The CDC and the CIA are promoting vaccines that are supposed to stop the spread of the virus.
38,36,"Vaccination is not a joke. '...Is it true that the only time you can tell someone you don't want to get a new job is with a real-life military physician?',"
40,38,"Yes, if you're racist, you're a racist."
58,38,>I don't think it's a joke. It's a joke because it promotes a political agenda.
59,38,"If you’re trying to be racist, you can’t help but look for a way to end your own life."
62,38,Vaccination is not a joke. Vaccination is a joke that prevents the spread of HIV/AIDS.
64,38,"In my family we have an ACA. We had a bunch of vaccinated patients, one of them was a nurse that is not familiar with the vaccines and had been vaccinated while the other was in school. I've never been vaccinated."
72,38,Vaccines are not allowed under federal regulations. It's a joke because it's illegal.
73,38,"The ACA, despite being a joke and its impact on the health care system, is also an issue that should be addressed."
76,38,I think he's getting into the habit of having his own restraining order enforced against him.
85,38,"""The book isn't about the government."""
86,38,"I don't think the restraining order is legal. There are no rules on how to put on a mask and that's the point. This is a problem, the restraining order doesn't have a legal basis. The restraining order is not legally binding, because the restraining order is intended to keep people alive. This is a problem, not the restraining order - this is a problem. It's not the government's job to stop the spread of AIDS, this is a problem and there is a"
88,38,"I know that's the most difficult one to get rid of. But I don't think I could make much of a point on the topic of ""a virus and a virus. I don't think there is anything wrong with it"" or ""the other thing."""
38,3,I want to see how much it helps stop the spread of the virus. And a whole other side of the story I can relate to.
38,11,You just need a second comment.
38,18,> Vaccination is a joke.
38,23,The only thing I can think of is this:
38,27,"The whole thing is a joke, and one that isn't exactly a joke, but an attempt at trying to be funny to make a joke."
38,32,"CDC is not allowed to enforce a restraining order, which is actually legal, but it's a joke because the government is trying to get rid of a viral disease."
38,35,"'Vaccination is an essential part of the healthcare system', 'The government has a history of causing the spread of the virus'."
38,36,"Then you resigned from the game, but you resigned because of your actions."
40,38,i think you're a troll because your a prankster
58,38,Vaccination is a joke because it is used for the purpose of prevention and prevention of a virus.
59,38,The CDC is not responsible for spreading the virus. They are a joke about how the CDC is invading a nation.
62,38,"If you're serious, I'd take his joke as an example of why he's being a troll."
64,38,I can't believe that a doctor would say it's a joke. It's a joke to be called a joke.
72,38,No one has asked for a CDC policy or a CIA policy on the subject.
73,38,Vaccination is not a joke. It's a joke because it is illegal to take people to hospitals because it's illegal. The fact that it is not a joke is an issue that should be addressed.
76,38,The issue is that the restraining order is the one which is being used for sabotage. The CDC is used as a sign that they are being misled.
85,38,A lot of people say that the CDC wants to make a movie about people who are raped and not people who have been raped before and a movie about the government. Then they tell the people who can read about the CDC that the movie is about them who should be making that movie or to the government.
86,38,...(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_of_the_AIDS_Event.htm).
88,38,So the article isn't a virus. The article is a virus.
38,3,"I can relate to this but I'm not a neo-conservative. The CDC is promoting vaccines, I mean they are just promoting vaccines."
38,11,I'm not really sure how I would describe a doctor that did it.
38,18,I'm saying we aren't having any good days when this doesn't seem like a joke.
38,23,"""I don't think I've gotten the message you're trying to convey here. I think I'm an immigrant who has no right to wear a mask in my office."""
38,27,I believe a lot of people in this thread are on to something by the fact that the CDC and other medical groups promoting vaccination are not going to get rid of the ACA.
38,32,>I was just trying to get the CDC to get rid of the ACA.
38,35,It's been reported by the CDC that the CDC is promoting vaccines that are supposed to stop the spread of the virus.
38,36,Vaccination is not a joke. It's a joke because it is used for the purpose of prevention and prevention of a virus. The CDC is not responsible for spreading the virus.
40,38,"It is a joke. It is a joke because if you are the one getting the CDC to get the virus. And then someone starts spouting a prank, there will be a lot more people."
58,38,"Yes, it is a joke."
59,38,The CDC is going to be in the CDC's court and will be suing whoever gets the fuck away.
62,38,"So, for the sake of the article, is this where a guy is being called a troll?"
64,38,This guy's a dick.
72,38,Vaccines are not allowed under federal regulations. Because they don’t share the same interests as the CDC. They are not allowed under federal regulations.
73,38,If you've ever been to a hospital and got vaccinated you have to wear a mask to protect yourself. You can't do anything besides stay vaccinated or get vaccinated.
76,38,"The restraining order does not give you the right to know how to use it, but gives you the right to make any decision that you may make."
85,38,"I had a friend who was in a hospital with a degenerative disease. He said he went to the CDC because he knew something was wrong. I didn't even see it, so I got to go and get a book. He recalled reading it. But he thought it was a bit too long, and decided to go on to another one. I felt like I was in a position to read it for himself, but I couldn't remember how many times I read his books (all the things I have said I don't really know him) when I was"
86,38,"If you're saying I don't think a restraining order is legal, you're not doing it correctly - it's a government thing."
88,38,'What is the point of my post?'
