43,29,The best way to stop the spread of a virus is with a mask.
56,29,There was a televised livestream from a group of doctors on their own last night that was claiming to be helping a virus.
59,29,The article is called “wearing a mask” because of the lack of mandates. The article refers to it being part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.It is not a mask.
68,29,I mean the guy who went to Twitchcon and went to the event with a vaccinated person with boosters. We had to put on a mask and the person who was vaccinated was also put on a mask.
70,29,Is it possible to wear a mask more than four times a day?
84,29,"I'm not sure if it is a scam or not, but it seems as though the government is using the same method of combating viruses, including those in the US."

29,4,And now they just got a mask for you?
29,12,You know how the virus spreads? The people who got vaccinated already infected themselves.

29,22,And the government is trying to prevent the spread of the virus by stating that it will not stop people from wearing a mask.
29,24,I think the next thing that gets people wondering is when it's a sick person.
29,28,I have a mask. It's the same thing as an umbrella or jacket that it's worn with a backpack. Usually with a shirt on.

29,12,"That's not a bad idea, and they're trying to do something wrong. If the government wants to protect people it should. But the government isn't making any effort to stop people from going to the polls without it. It's the CDC, so they're making a pretty big deal out of it."

It's a good thing that people are trying to get it under control, and in that case, it's really not a good idea to go to a doctor. I think there's a lot of people who do this."
29,24,"No, they are not going to do a good job of stopping the spread of a virus, and that's their job to keep the government safe."
29,28,I want to tell you what this guy was trying to make up. It's not a bad thing. I don't want to be the one dissenting.
43,29,"Apparently this means the government is using a virus and not the players. I'm in a doctor's office. It's just part of the anti-virus movement. The vaccinations are a problem. We all have this question: Who did you shit on? What are you guys?? The biggest threat is when a player gets fucked. They can't even tell the truth, so it's up to them to find an alternative. I'm the one that has some evidence to support this nonsense."

He did it because of the lack of evidence about the person who was actually doing it - he just said he was not going to use it on his own people, he said they would only be wearing it to prevent a virus, which is why he was trying to do it because it was illegal. Vaccines will also be the way to go. It doesn't say you can't wear a mask on the head of a person, but it is not"
68,29,"I was at the TWitchcon last year, and a doctor went to the event with a vaccineed person with boosters, and my husband was not in the bathroom, so he had to wear a mask."
70,29,"CANNOTANSWER: If a doctor tells you to leave your mask off, they need to get you vaccinated."
84,29,"Yes, I'm a scammer, and that's exactly what I said. I am a CDC scum, and it is scam, but it is a scam because people use it to stop the spread of a virus and I am not a scammer. Is this the right thing to do for the people to do?"
86,29,"That's not an appropriate reason for an argument, and I'm not interested in any further answers."
29,4,The people who are sick aren't just talking about their health. It's about being a good friend to the people who care about their health.
29,12,"He said he had to keep the CDC on his head. And that he got a virus, so they need to get him vaccinated. And no he didn't."

29,22,You have a really good argument and I agree. But he’s just trying to use it to make the government sound like a dick and not a real one.
29,24,"The article is a bit misleading, but it does contain some of the points I just described."
29,28,"In other words, he was trying to make fun of people for doing it afaik."
43,29,It sounds like the NSA is using a virus as an excuse for not allowing the players to get their vaccines. They are not authorized to have them in a facility because they don't have the same safety procedures and are only allowed to have the masks.
56,29,"As someone who is infected with HIV/AIDS, this is what you need to know."
59,29,"[This is a pretty common topic, but it is not an easy one to explain.](http://www.whi.edu/disabled/articles/theft/r/research/apes/index.html). It's one of my favorite parts."
68,29,Vaccination is very important. We have vaccines all the time and you should be very careful.
70,29,"And the problem with a mask is that people are sick and have an infection of some kind, not what's actually being used to fight off the virus. So I think it is kind of ridiculous for people to wear masks to fend off their illnesses in order to stop a virus from spreading."
84,29,I had a couple of them on the internet but had never heard of them. Then it popped up on my Facebook page.
86,29,It's hard to explain this without going into a discussion and arguing. Your friend's friend is not only a victim of the shit he did. The mask was deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
29,4,"So I don't know if I have a story to add but if you do, I don't think it's the right thing to do to vaccinate you. I'm just thinking, 'Oh, it's not a virus. I can't vaccinate you'."
29,12,"""You know how the virus spreads? The people who got vaccinated already infected themselves."""
29,14,"The government is using a mask to help those who are not vaccinated with HIV/AIDS. I think this is a pretty reasonable reason to try to help the patients with the virus, especially since they have a lot of information about the NSA."
29,15,"CANNOTANSWER AN AXE, TO BACK UP!"
29,22,You said that it was a great idea for the CDC to get the vaccines on the people who get HIV/AIDS.
29,24,"This is a logical argument. I'm not a doctor or anything but I've been vaccinated by a very experienced and well known physician, who has done nothing but help people who don't get their vaccines, and who doesn't seem to have any understanding of the real meanings of this, so it would be a bit of a stretch to assume he's just being a dick."
29,28,"So they have a free pass to go to a festival with a mask on? I mean, I can tell that they're putting them on and not wanting to put on a mask."
43,29,"It's a pity that the masks were provided for the players not to get vaccinated, or even because the players were so well screened and not screened, so that the players could be vaccinated. That's so ridiculous."
56,29,"I'm not sure if he'd disagree with Obama or not. I guess you'd also be able to say that the NSA is not supposed to stop spreading the virus. He's not a troll, but I feel that the CDC has been attempting to discredit the virus."
59,29,As a member of the Vaccine Club I'm not sure why this guy isn't mentioned in the article.
68,29,I'd never go to a party without a mask.
70,29,The virus is very prevalent and it's very clear to everyone that it's the virus. Vaccination is essential to stop any epidemic in the world.
84,29,The idea that you're not a scammer is part of the CDC's attempt to combat a virus.

29,12,Vaccination is essential to stop the spread of any epidemic in the world. The idea that you're not a scammer is part of the CDC's attempt to combat a virus.
29,14,I'd rather do it with a mask. I think it has the potential to be useful for people who aren't vaccinated with HIV/AIDS and who can't afford to be vaccinated by the CDC.
29,15,Vaccines are a good thing to have because they prevent the spread of many types of diseases. There are no guarantees about the protections that your doctor would provide.
29,22,Vaccination is essential to stop any epidemic in the world. The idea that you're not a scammer is part of the CDC's attempt to combat a virus.
29,24,Vaccination is essential to stop any epidemic in the world. The idea that you're not a scammer is part of the CDC's attempt to combat a virus.
29,28,ah I see. I'm so sorry to hear that. Vaccination and the spread of AIDS are a great idea. I'm sorry that your doctor has made this a priority. I know they have been a lot of work lately on anti-HIV.
43,29,"You are so fucked up, you have no reason to believe the CDC is using a virus as an excuse."
56,29,"Vaccination is very bad, but despite the fact that it's probably a scam, it's very unlikely that there is some kind of fraud going on."
59,29,"Vaccines aren't always used as a vaccine, but they are a safety net. Vaccines can also be used for other purposes. It's called an ""event"" mask because it can provide a more specialized vantage point on the air. And there is a reason why they are often considered a ""healthy precaution""."
68,29,I just found out that the article I'm reading is incorrect.
70,29,A CDC official apologises but still takes a joke.
84,29,"The people who aren't vaccinated are a scumbag and the people who aren't, and they need to be vaccinated. They are not scammers because they are not scammed."
86,29,I'm not a lawyer.
29,4,"I know that the article is wrong, but what is the point of using a mask? What do you mean ""a friend of mine, who is vaccinated against HIV, has reported that the government is ignoring the CDC's orders and is attempting to circumvent it."" I'm sorry."
29,12,You're saying the mask is scammed. You are being misconstrued.

29,28,"The mask that they use is a ""good thing"" to have because it prevents the spread of viruses. And they are not scammers because they are not scammed."
43,29,I think people that believe this quote are the government and their medical providers. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of a virus. Please wear masks.
56,29,I don't know about a lot of this.
59,29,"I think the article is really cynical and stupid. The article is a very generalization, and it's not a political statement, but a practical one. Vaccines are only used in the U.S. and can be used to make people sick. They are not a safety net. A syphilis vaccine, for example, isn't a safety net."
68,29,I've read a lot of the posts saying he trolled the r/health sub and is probably getting some answers too. The article does not actually address the issue. It's been an interesting one.
70,29,It isn't like they have to go to the doctors for them to make a joke.
84,29,I'm going to say a simple truth - I grew up in a very conservative area and I've had multiple masks worn by people of the same gender. I've also had some cases of those masks being lost by people whose mothers and dads never got them. I think that it does make sense that if you are a fraudster that they can't take you seriously but you aren't doing anything wrong.

29,4,Are you going to be able to smear these words in a way that you will hear them in the face? The CDC have a very clear definition of a joke.
29,12,"Because you can't take care of yourself, don't be a dickhead."
29,14,That's a little cheesy. They're promoting the ACA and its use of vaccines.
29,15,Vaccination is the name of the vaccine. It is the name of the people that get the vaccine.

43,29,"Yes, it's a joke about how the CDC is invading the civilian population by making the most of it - they are destroying public health. And their actions are also a joke to them because they aren't a good place to live."

29,22,... is this what's a joke?
29,24,If the vaccine is still on the CDC's agenda they will be shutting down the government because if someone does it will make them sick and that means they aren't in a good position to prevent any retaliation.
29,28,I'd like to say that 'the article is about the CDC's effort to ban the spread of AIDS in the US. ''The article is about the CDC and not a restraining order.'''
43,29,The CDC has never been able to get a vaccinated person to get an immune to a virus. Vaccinations aren't effective in treating a viral infection if not for an infection. The CDC has been using the same procedures for those who aren't screened and not allowed to get vaccinated.
56,29,"This is a joke, but it isn't a joke, and this isn't a joke. It's a joke because a joke isn't something that the government can make it."
59,29,What if this article says the president is going to try to sabotage this shit by allowing the CIA to ban syphilis?
68,29,i think the only way that's really funny is if you don't get vaccinated. That's an asshole that is trying to make a joke about the ACA and faking that joke about it.

29,22,I would love to hear how the CDC manages to prevent the spread of a virus.
29,24,"It's a joke, and a joke. But to be honest, a CDC restraining order is only a joke, and the CDC has no right to use it. The only real reason is to sabotage the government because a mask is illegal (like a restraining order, not a law), i.e., if the President doesn't get vaccinated they should restraining order."
29,28,"""Vaccination is not a joke. They are trying to discredit the government."
43,29,It's a joke. He's trying to 'do something funny' without any reason to cite other things.

59,29,"I'm a horoscoped medical student, I've done this. Vaccines are safe - if they are needed it's usually a safety net. The CDC can do anything, but I think they are a joke."
68,29,I think he should take some form of action to get him to comply with his stance. There is no “joke” for wearing a mask unless you are being told you do.
70,29,The president has no reason to think that vaccination is important. He thinks that it’s a joke because it’s in place and it’s not able to fight off any virus well. So he doesn’t have the right to make jokes about any president if he thinks it’s necessary.
84,29,"""This is a joke, but it's a joke""."
86,29,Is there a problem with this? The question is if the president needs to do this in order to keep the CDC from enforcing the order. Is he going to get a restraining order?

43,29,Vaccination is a joke. But I'm sure there is a joke somewhere about it.
56,29,I was not aware of the joke.
59,29,This whole post is about a joke. 'What's the joke?
68,29,“Vaccination is a major part of the healthcare system. We have vaccines all the time and you should be very careful.”
70,29,The issue is that the first two question is about the president and the second is about 'why are you wearing a mask more than 4 times a day?'
84,29,">But if they aren't doing anything about it, you have a case to prove. It's not a joke. It's a joke because they want to make money off of the vaccine."
86,29,"As a former AIDS victim, I can say with certainty that this isn't normal behavior."
29,4,The problem is that the government isn't protecting the public and isn't providing healthcare to all AIDS victims.
29,12,Vaccination is not a joke. It is a joke because it's in place and it's necessary.
29,14,Vaccines are the only way to stop the spread of a virus. The CDC can't enforce the law so it's not necessary for them to provide vaccinations.
29,15,"CANNOTANSWER AN AXE, TO BACK UP!"
29,22,I think this is one of the main areas of controversy in the debate. Is the issue that the president is putting a mask on and not that he is being a jerk?
29,24,And how does this even start?
29,28,"Vaccination is a joke. I'm sorry, it was a joke."
43,29,"““Also, if a vaccine has been approved in the United States, I would resign and not play hockey until that has been approved by Congress.”"
56,29,Vaccination is a joke because of the fact that the CDC and the CDC are trying to stop the spread of the virus.
59,29,I'm pretty sure this is a joke a bunch of people are trying to get at the news headlines and then get in the news and find this is about a troll snobbering up.
68,29,Vaccination is an essential part of the healthcare system and it is essential to the health of people who need it.
70,29,Vaccination is an important part of protecting against any virus. They are trying to discredit the CDC and stop it from spreading. They are referring to a new era. It is not a joke and they are trying to sabotage the president because the president is racist.
84,29,It sounds like the CDC is trying to help stop the spread of HIV.
86,29,Yes he has a mandate to wear a mask. A law that enables that to happen and that has been passed to protect other people if they don't have one.
29,4,"Yes. In my experience, this is true."
29,12,Vaccination isn't a joke.
29,14,It doesn't seem to be a joke to me at all. I have read all of the comments on this sub and it's clear that the president has no idea what's going on with the CDC and is pointing out the point of this whole thread.
29,15,"This is just an 'A' but it's a 'T' and the 'C' is about him and a 'R' is about him and the 'B' is about him, that's how it's meant to be said. The 'C' is just a little funny and you're not being an asshole if you ask me. You are just being silly and you aren't a man. They're just snarky and you're being a joke."
29,22,"This is why this sub is called the 'Suicide Against Women'. The acronym for that is the 'Naw, it is not a joke'."
29,24,It's very difficult to tell what the best way to stop the spread of a virus is. It's not really easy to get vaccinated in public.
29,28,I am not sure what the story about the person who was vaccinated with HIV has to do with that.
43,29,I am a lawyer and I would resign and not play hockey until that has been approved.
56,29,The joke doesn't get the humor right.
59,29,"The CDC has made sure that the entire NSA is protecting the public. Vaccines are a safety net, so there's nothing wrong with them, especially when they have the authority."

68,29,Vaccination is a big part of the healthcare system. But it's also important for the government. The CDC is trying to get the system to a point of no respect for a person who is not immune from viruses.
