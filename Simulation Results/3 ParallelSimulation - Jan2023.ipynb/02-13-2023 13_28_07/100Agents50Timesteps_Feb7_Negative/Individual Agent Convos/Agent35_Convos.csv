35,30,"You can't make your team feel bad, they only get their way if they don't have their backs turned off."
38,35,This is the premise of this thread.
39,35,"That's a pretty typical'mask wearing' and I'd say it's one of the best ways to stop the spread of the virus, not the most effective."
48,35,"I think the issue here is that you want to wear a mask to avoid getting sick, so you don't get to wear them."
56,35,"If it wasn't a f-bomb, it wouldn't have existed. The government could have had other things going on in the world, including what the players have in the locker rooms, and what the player has gone through."

You are right to talk about the dangers of using masks, but they're only used for the purpose of preventing the spread of the virus. The most powerful politician is a skeptic.

77,35,"I'm a naive apologist, but I've heard that ""the government does not have authority to wear a mask."""
85,35,This is exactly the type of problem that could be solved by using a mask.
35,1,This is a very common problem in the US and it seems the most logical way to respond.
35,10,"The issue with a mask is that you're afraid of getting sick, so you don't get to wear them."

35,30,"I don't see how they can eat up all the health and safety precautions that they have that prevent a virus from entering. I think the reason is because they think it is necessary to prevent a virus from circulating, so they are forced to wear them to keep them safe from infections."
38,35,"The issue here isn't the ""Madness is good for you"" issue."
39,35,It's a scam. You can't just walk to the bathroom without a mask in order to get vaccinated.

48,35,"What do you think about all the comments, which are based on the most recent fuck up that the author of this article has ever written? You say that he has no clue what is going on here. The first one makes absolutely no sense, since it's an article that says that the government is willing to put resources into helping vaccines. It doesn't seem like the first person that thinks so. It's basically a conspiracy theory."
56,35,"This is what I do when I'm at home with a friend who is vaccinated. Is he a cop, or an anti-vaccine activist, or even just a troll, or something?"
61,35,"Is the guy at TWitchcon wearing a mask a liar? If not, the whole ol' thing looks like it's about people who haven't been vaccinated, and don't want to do that, the guy who told the story just didn't know he was going to do it."

38,35,CANNOTANSWER: The CDC and the US government are promoting vaccines that are supposed to stop spread of the virus (Vaccines). This article says that the CDC is making a huge push to recertify the protection of people who are not aware of them.
39,35,"""You're a scam."""
48,35,You could get an ad on a local newspaper to make an informed decision.
56,35,It’s not the government that is pulling the plug. It’s the government that is controlling and preventing the spread of the virus. Vaccination is illegal.
61,35,They don't even have mandates in the US. If they don't get vaccines that's an issue.
64,35,"What's your favorite word? The ""fucking government."" Vaccinating is the best way to stop the spread of a virus."

35,10,"It's pretty sure you don't have an insurance policy to cover you if you get sick. And if you do, you can do it for free."

56,35,I think that most of these are just misnomers. The government can't be both narcissists and sexists or anything other than promoting their lies. Vaccination is the best way to stop a spread of a virus. I can see why it wouldn't have been a scam.
61,35,"The thing is, the fact that people can't be vaccinated is really ridiculous. It is a joke and they want people to be vaccinated? Because you can be a doctor, not just a doctor. There is no such thing as a doctor unless you are not vaccinated. You are a doctor. I think it's time to stop blaming it on the government and start blaming their own actions for a virus that's already in the sph. You're just a joke."
64,35,Why are they so resistant to the viruses? I'm not sure how to respond.
66,35,I would also say that he's trying to convince the defense attorney that his position is as a fraud as a scam. I'd just not want to risk losing any of my clients and his ability to control the system. The CDC doesn't want to prevent people from getting flu shot and they are rushing the vaccination.

35,1,If you haven't tried to go back a few times in the last month or so you should. You have a VERY good idea what's going on.

The FDA is looking for a way to reduce the amount of people who have the flu and get it without a mask.

35,18,"You're putting this as a whole new meaning to the word ""hilarity."""
35,30,[https://www.doh.gov/wws/faqs/mild/rhtc/i-wrfcqs.htm)
38,35,"That is a pretty serious question. I'm gonna go ahead and read the article and take it from there, as it makes you understand that the CDC and the CIA are promoting vaccines that are supposed to stop the spread of the virus."
39,35,"You've been vaccinated but your mask mask was very poorly matched with a tampon, right?"
48,35,> I do a lot of dumb things
56,35,Vaccination is illegal and it's not just a joke.
61,35,And... so there you go.
64,35,"I don't know why the President didn't take a joke like that and now that he's officially getting his MMR, you should probably take a stance on why the president was going to be in favor of the ACA instead of vaccinating people to prevent them from getting sick."
66,35,>The CDC is suing the CDC for a joke that doesn't allow them to pass vaccines on people who aren't safe from getting vaccinated.
72,35,"This is going to be a great discussion and will be the most entertaining one I've ever had in a long time. You know, I've been through some of these a couple of times now."
73,35,"If there is a real problem, don't go to a doctor, or go to a doctor's office. You know, there's a chance that the government isn't even going to fix it. I don't know, what it is, and what a joke is."

77,35,It seems to me that there is a very real problem in the CDC that is preventing the spread of the virus. They are trying to prevent it from spreading and they ARE making a movie about it. The CDC will pay someone to be a shaman and he will tell you what they can and can't do.
85,35,What do you think is the problem with this idea? Does it make sense that he's just using a mask because he was the one who invented it?
35,1,This is the best article to have all week.
35,10,"Almost all of this has nothing to do with the CDC or the government. This article isn't legal advice. The article is just a joke. The CDC, CIA, FBI and media can't tell you how much of a savage it is. They are in no position to know what to do about it. They are in no position to know what to do about it. They are not in a position to know what to do about it. They are not in a position to know what to do about it."
35,15,The word joke comes from a person who has heard the joke. You have no idea what that means. It's not really a joke at all.
35,18,They're not doing anything for the money to prevent that. And it's not a joke because they don't know what to do. But the CDC is doing something to prevent that. They are just making a huge deal out of it. Vaccination is the way to go.
35,30,There's a really big problem here.
38,35,This guy is a pretty good ol's mcdonalds guy.
39,35,I thought this was a really funny story.
48,35,The article was intended as an obtuse joke. The CDC is not part of the CDC.

73,35,"The ACA is a joke, but it isn't legal. You can't stop people from having an infection. It's a joke because the government isn't on the receiving end of the problem. It's a joke because they aren't allowed to take care of people who don't get vaccinated."

85,35,"The book he wrote about the Devil Wears a Tree and his book is not ""a movie"", but is a documentary on the government and its uses."
35,1,>Is it not a scam. It's a scam. The article says that the CDC and the US government is promoting vaccines that are supposed to stop the spread of a virus.
35,10,Why can't the government take care of people who don't get vaccinated? What would you call it?
35,15,So you were born in the United States? It was a joke in the form of a joke?
35,18,The CDC is not the CDC.
35,30,"They are making a joke about it. It's an issue and they can't do it. They're doing something to stop it. They can't do anything about it. They are just making a joke about it, or it's just a joke."
38,35,I don’t understand how the author can’t be racist.
39,35,Is the article about what the CDC is trying to promote?
48,35,You seem to think that the joke was intended to be a joke. The article says the CDC has no responsibility to stop the spread of HIV. The article also says that the CDC has no responsibility to prevent the spread of the virus.
56,35,I don't understand why you'd get that if you were a lawyer.
61,35,Because it’s just a joke.
64,35,There is a rape joke.

77,35,There is an ad for that and they are making movies about it. There is one called the Awkward Path.
85,35,"This sounds like a good book. It's got some good premise, but it has also got some bad themes (I like to think that the author has a lot of people trying to get him to change things, but not the people who have the best idea). But I don't think he's inventing anything."
35,1,"It's a hive mind, and if you read that and have a few months to see what the government is trying to do, you should really consider yourself lucky to be in the country where the people who are vaccinated are still being educated on it."
35,10,"You have no idea why the CDC is promoting vaccines, and it's a joke. There is a documentary about the CDC that is a good one."
35,15,I like your quote a lot but I don't know how you can explain that.
35,18,I think this book is one of the most funny bits of the story. I think it's funny because it demonstrates that the government is not doing it right.
35,30,"I mean, the whole thing isn’t a joke because it’s part of a joke, and the article does mention what it means because the government has no power to stop the spread of a virus. The article says the CDC doesn’t have authority to stop the spread of a virus. But the CDC isn’t on the receiving end of the problem. They are promoting vaccines and the CDC is trying to take away people’s health. They are just making a joke about it."
38,35,"I believe that this is because of the NSA trying to ""prevent"" the spread of the virus. If they don't take action to stop it, and try to stop the spread of it, it's no longer a joke and is just a joke."
39,35,It was a joke. Vaccination is a joke.
48,35,"It's a joke to imply the president has no role in stopping HIV from spreading, but to imply the people who don't have a role in the spread of HIV are just being shady."
56,35,"> ""A guy who is a doctor who does AIDS research will often tell me how sick he is by telling me a joke to prevent them. I’m a doctor and the only reason I don’t like AIDS is because it is painfully obvious and it can’t be cured. I can’t see why someone would just laugh at a joke that comes across as an actual joke. A joke is a joke."
61,35,I'm a doctor who is only 15 years old and has a history of HIV. I want to talk to you about this stuff.
64,35,I think you are making an idealized sarcasm joke here:
66,35,"ACA isn't racist, unless it's part of the ACA and isn't being pushed by the government."
72,35,"""It's a joke because it's illegal. It's a joke because it's illegal."
73,35,"A joke is a joke. A joke is a joke.... ''The only reason I think this is a joke is because they don't have the authority to do it. The government doesn't even have the authority to do it. The only thing they want to do is the ACA removed, because they don't want to prevent people from having an infection. The only thing they want to do is the ACA removed, because it's not legal."
74,35,That's not an interesting joke. I do think it's interesting to think about the CDC and the vaccine. I don't think they're just trying to protect the people with a mask.
77,35,I just read the title and see a link to the title to see the comments and see the title.
85,35,"This is a good example of how people can get rid of a stigma and be a good doctor for a better life, and how he wants the government to treat them as better people. He’s not shady at all, he has a very naive and well-written perspective and doesn’t understand how it works. He’s a good therapist and his book is a great example of how the government treats people in a different way. I don’t know the exact definition of the word to describe how people treat people."
35,1,"Vaccination is not a joke. The government has no role in preventing it. But they don't have the authority to stop it. They have no authority to stop it. The CDC wants to stop it. The only thing they want to stop is the ACA removed. The CDC is trying to stop it. If it's a joke, then it's a scam."
35,10,I read a good book called 'The Awkward Path' by Stephen Harper on his work. It's written by a man he's working for who's been on to do very well.
35,15,You've been to a doctor in person and have heard the joke. I don't have any information on that but I'm curious as to why the joke would come across that way.
35,18,"CANNOTANSWER: ""Weeds to Break a Tree is a great way to stop the spread of a virus. The CDC, CIA, FBI and media can tell you how much of a savage it is. The government, government, and media can tell you how much of a savage it is."
35,30,I think the most important thing here is to be clear:
38,35,Vaccination is an essential part of the healthcare system. The government has a history of causing the spread of the virus. The CDC and the CIA are promoting vaccines that are supposed to stop the spread of the virus.
39,35,Vaccination is a joke. It's a joke because it is. It's a joke because it's a joke.
48,35,The president needs to get rid of the CDC and stop it. It's a joke because it is going to help protect the country from an HIV epidemic.
56,35,"""I think it's a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke. Vaccination is illegal. I think it's a joke because it's a joke. I think that's why it's illegal."
61,35,Isn't it like the government wanting you to be in charge of the medical system that is destroying the health of the world? Are you sick of the AIDS epidemic? And why should you be there to prevent it?
64,35,"I think a lot of people are still waiting for the government to take action against the ACA and start making ridiculous jokes about the ACA, especially considering how the ACA aims to effect people in other countries."
66,35,The fact that you are being sarcastic doesn't mean you're not racist.
72,35,"As much as the CDC is working to prevent the spread of AIDS, it’s the government’s job to keep those people from avoiding any risk. It’s not illegal for them to do it."
73,35,">I don’t think it’s a joke because they don’t have the authority to do it. The only thing they want to do is the ACA removed, because it’s not legal."
74,35,No one wants to hear that the government is preventing the spread of the virus.
77,35,People who wear masks are not racist.
85,35,"This makes no sense, and the book is based off of the book, not the book."
35,1,"If you want to talk about a scam, then I would have to explain it and the government would have to give you a sarcastic comment. Those words are the key words."
35,10,">I read a good book called ""The Awkward Path"" by Stephen Harper on his work. It's written by a man he's working for who's been on to do very well."
35,15,Then go to the CDC.
35,18,A good example of the nature of the problem.
35,30,There's a big issue with it's effectiveness. The CDC has gotten a lot of attention.
38,35,"You might also like the fact that this article is about people who haven't heard of ""vaccinated"" because of all the smoke — ""Especially because of all the smoke, it's not as harmless as wearing a mask."""

48,35,I can't agree more with your comments on this article. I'm a lawyer and I'm sure you'll find your way. I'll read more.
56,35,"They are not using the vaccines, but rather the CDC, which issuing the CDC for fraud."
61,35,"The entire point is that you don't need to be vaccinated in order to get the vaccines. If you can't get the vaccinations then you'll probably need to be in contact with the CDC, and the CDC can help you get the vaccines for you."
64,35,It's supposed to be a joke.
66,35,"There's a lot of confusion about how the CDC and the NSA would be suing the government, which is why they are suing the government."
72,35,"The CDC does not enforce their own laws and is based on it, and they are still illegal to do so."
73,35,There are a lot of things in this ACA that are so funny they are hilarious to watch.
74,35,"No, it's not a joke. It's a joke."
77,35,It's called The Devil Wears a Mask.
85,35,"They have to get over the shit, not their masks."
35,1,">A few other things, the CDC is helping. It's not going to be a joke. The CDC is trying to stop it. The only thing they can get to the person who is doing it will be to sue them. Then the CDC and the NSA will do the same thing to stop the spread of the virus."

35,18,I'm afraid I have to say that I do not know the difference between a joke and a joke.
35,30,People who are not aware of a mask are actually being shady and obtuse. And they have to wear masks to prevent it from happening. The point is that they are trying to stop people getting sick. Because if people didn't know the word 'vaccinated' they wouldn't have had the've read the article'.
38,35,The article is misleading because the author is implying that the CDC and the CIA are promoting vaccines that are supposed to stop the spread of the virus. Vaccination is an essential part of the healthcare system. The CDC and the CIA are promoting vaccines that are supposed to stop the spread of the virus.
39,35,Vaccination is a joke because it is a joke. The CDC is calling the ACA a joke. The joke is that the CDC is trying to sabotage the health system.
48,35,"Vaccination is a joke because the CDC is abused by the CIA and AIDS is the same thing they are saying ""it's illegal to prevent sex from spreading."""
56,35,"""This is one of the best jokes I’ve ever heard."","
61,35,Is the first part of the joke a joke? Because it's a joke.
64,35,I'd wear a mask and be vaccinated.
66,35,The article is a joke. CDC is not suing CDC for any reason.
72,35,"''I’m not sure what to say, because I’ve been through some of these a couple of times now."
73,35,"As a former NFL head coach, I can tell you that a lot of things are so funny they are hilarious to watch."
74,35,Then why didn't they just make a joke for people to hear about the problem and then make a joke for the people to think about it?
77,35,So the best way to go.
85,35,"A lot of people arguing this is why I don't believe in the ""Serious Men"", but I just don't think the whole point is, ""How is it a good example of how the government treats people, but the government does nothing about it"". I don't think ""Must read a book without a cigarette lighter."" I think ""If you can read it and it's based off of the book"" is misleading, but the book is based on the book. What about the movie"""
35,1,"I don't think there's a good enough reason for the government to do anything. The CDC is not promoting vaccinations, they're just trying to make a joke."
35,10,">They don't have a role in stopping the spread of the virus. They are promoting vaccines that are supposed to stop the spread of the virus.

38,35,"'Vaccination is an essential part of the healthcare system', 'The government has a history of causing the spread of the virus'."
39,35,The article isn't going to be about the CDC. It's about what they are doing. They aren't saying the article is wrong. It's not a joke. The joke is that the CDC is promoting vaccinations. That's a joke.
48,35,The only thing i know about vaccines is that they have been being used by governments on a national level to fight AIDS. They are being abused. It isn't a joke.
56,35,The government is suing the CDC for fraud. Vaccination is illegal and is the only cure to HIV and related diseases.
61,35,"Are you a doctor or a doctor? Is your bf telling the joke or is it a joke? Because I'm a doctor and I know what the joke is, not a joke."
