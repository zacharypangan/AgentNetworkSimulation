22,2,IANAL. I sat here wondering if I was in this thread because a piece of my brain thought it would go haywire and it came off as a joke.
22,10,"I have a mask, and I wear it to work."
22,18,I lost a mask 4 times in 4 days - and the virus has not returned yet.

43,22,"Oh, and I'm a guy."
45,22,"Yes, I'm sure some of the players have already committed a number of serious crimes."
50,22,i'm going to add some more points:
58,22,"OP, I'm a little annoyed that the government is so obnoxious with their policy on putting on masks."
61,22,I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam. Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
70,22,I lost a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i have ever done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things I lost a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam. I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam. I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam.
71,22,I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam. I'm still terrified of a broken one.
77,22,"In a similar vein I lost a mask because I lost my face when I got to work. That's a good thing, too. I lose a mask because I'm in a hurry."
80,22,Are you a tv host? I'm a big fan of that ''same guys'''
84,22,Exactly what i was gonna say.
22,1,I lose a mask because I lose my face when I got to work.
22,2,I lost my mask four times in four days - and the virus has not returned yet. Oh man... I don't think this makes much sense.
22,10,"It's really bad that the government has a mandate to put on masks, as well as trying to be more honest with the world, since they believe that they are being used to stop the spread of a virus."
22,18,"...but this is so wrong, I can't even explain it... I can just say it is a scam"
22,21,I'm going to say this about TWitchCon and masks you can hate me if the state town doesn't have an mandates you can hate me if the state town doesn't have an mandates you can hate me if the state town doesn't have an mandates you can hate me if the state town doesn't have an mandates you can hate me if the state town doesn't have an mandates you can hate me if the state town doesn't have an mandates you can hate me if the state town doesn't have an mandates
28,22,"i'm sorry, but I do get sick with my mask and not having any proper mask on. I feel like I'm doing something wrong, that my mask is still there, but I do still wear my mask."
29,22,It's a good thing he's putting the mask on and being able to watch people smoke.
33,22,"I think you are putting too much on ""wearing a mask"" by doing it without warning, and you are being sarcastic. It's kind of sad that you can't have any of these, and you don't have the right to say that your mom is the one who can't get a vaccine, but also that she isn't able to get a vaccine."
37,22,This is a real shame. We have to start taking steps to stop this. The government has no rights over what it says.
42,22,It's ridiculous and it's ok to wear a mask. Just because you're not in a state doesn't mean they're in a state where it's illegal to wear it.
43,22,"I'm gonna leave you alone, but hey, I'll get you on."
45,22,"If you have been diagnosed with the flu, your doctor has told you not to wear it at all."
50,22,I see where you're coming from and I see where you're coming from.
58,22,It's not ok to wear a mask. You are making a huge statement that putting on a mask is the only way to prevent the spread of a virus.
61,22,In order to stop the spread of a virus. I lost a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks. I'm not going to take the job stymied unless I wear a mask. I don't want to be a sick squatter with the vaccinated vaccine I have.
70,22,"I'm going to say this as a guy that I have met and a girl who seems to have an addiction to e-cigarettes. Apparently, I just lost her. So yeah, I know it's a scam, but I guess I can't really say if that's true."
71,22,"I lost a mask every day and squirm when it's still cold, it's my shit, it's my day. And my shit is just fine."
77,22,I see how you're coming across a bit naive and don't want to be taken seriously.
80,22,"It's just a joke, and a joke in itself, but you're gonna be an amazing coach."
84,22,I'm pretty sure you're not a scam.

22,10,I'd say the whole government is trying to be more honest with the world.
22,18,I don't understand why people think people are scummy about getting vaccines. The government is in a position to stop spreading a virus and they don't want to pay attention to what 'right' means.
22,21,> Putting on a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of a virus. Please wear a mask.
28,22,"""I lost a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam. I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam. I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam. I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam. I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam. I lose a mask at least four times a day."
29,22,And the government is trying to prevent the spread of the virus by stating that it will not stop people from wearing a mask.
33,22,The government is not a fool. It is a scam.
37,22,You should be ashamed of yourself and the people you respect. But the government is a dick and should be put to work with.
42,22,The question that you're asking is: Are you wearing a mask for the sake of the vaccinated person?
43,22,"I'm the one that has some evidence to support this nonsense. Then again, there isn't any proof that it was in the constitution."
45,22,I have been the head coach of the Seattle Seahawks. Apparently they have a very strong CDC.
50,22,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. There is a good chance that Trump has some sort of anti-virus stance, and it's a good chance that he won't take it off until the government stops trying to spread the disease. The government is going to end it by announcing that it has to do it all in one night, but there's no way in hell it won't do it."
58,22,I feel like they're making some pretty stupid and offensive statements. It's probably just a way of saying that in the US there is a very specific role to play for the health and safety of our people.
61,22,I want to say that I am afraid to say this.
70,22,"I believe a lot of the comments are a bunch of things that would be useful to people who are sick or need treatment to stop their symptoms. You’d have a lot of good shit to say, you have a lot of bad shit to say."
71,22,"This is where they really should not be concerned about the leakage. They're going to need a new mask that stops all the symptoms and is a better solution than a shit nose, snot nose, or a nasal spray. And that's just how the government is doing this."
77,22,"I like to make a remark on a website that talks about how people have been on the Internet for the last 10 years that say ""I have to wear a mask for a period of time"" but not on a site that says ""I'm not going to get a real job."""
80,22,... that's what the title says and I would like to say.
84,22,Its not just the president. Its a conspiracy theory. The whole idea is to keep the people alive by doing things that would cause them to die. The fact that they would lose the mask is a huge scam.
22,1,I want to know how you think people are'scummy' about the government being able to stop the spread of a virus.
22,2,"You could wear a mask a lot more often than you would normally. In my state, I have to wear masks a lot, sometimes twice per day, but this is what I'm going to be looking for and getting to know."
22,10,It's a scam.
22,18,"Well the government has nothing to do with the vaccine, or anything else, except they are trying to stop it."
22,21,"As a US citizen who lost my mask 4 times on a 4th day, I wouldn't recommend it."
28,22,I think the question isn't whether or not the 'Microsoft' government is willing to put a lot of resources into helping vaccines.
29,22,"The article in question actually says ""If you want to help a person with the spread of a virus, I would put on a helmet and it is not a mask. It's a good thing that people are trying to get it under control, and in that case, it's really not a good idea to go to a doctor. I think there's a lot of people who do this."
33,22,I think the people with dm's were probably already working the scam in the past but I think the joke is now gone and you need to go to your parents - or go back and make a new one. I'm gonna go back to my parents so they can use my new masks to do what I do.
37,22,"""Uhm, the mask isn't the answer. I can't really answer it. I can't answer the question that's always coming up. I need to figure out whether I need to wear it. I need to find out why people think the government is wrong and can't make any other policy change besides having to tell people to change the law. We need to start moving and moving. We need to be in the clear and the only one who really wants to change is the government. That's our right to protect us against illness. We need to change the law. I"
42,22,You're assuming that someone who does not have a mask would be able to make a diagnosis of a serious illness. Then a doctor in a NICU will ask if you're wearing a mask to stop the spread of a virus.
43,22,I’m not a lawyer. I know I’m wrong. I’m just an uninformed individual that I’ve never heard of any such thing. If I had known my father who was a lawyer I would have told him to leave the state. If it were me I’d go to the doctor and get a free one. If I went to a doctor and he didn’t want to do that it’s probably too easy. I’d be a good judge.
45,22,I think it would be interesting to ask the person who is currently a head coach if their head coach has made any changes to the laws or policies.
50,22,That's the same thing the NSA does. I was told that the reason he did it is because he was afraid of the NSA. But that's another story. I was told that it was a joke. He's not a genius. He just did it to save us from some serious risk.
58,22,I think you're being sarcastic.
61,22,>I'm not going to take the job stymied unless I wear a mask. I don't want to be a sick squatter with the vaccinated vaccine I have. You are in the wrong. You aren't doing the right thing.
70,22,"It's been reported that in 2008, the president decided to wear a mask. They made it so people could see that the president had an infection and then if the president didn't, the president would use it to spread the virus."
71,22,"You're a fraud, so I don't know what to do with this one."
77,22,I just found out this week that I have lost a mask.
80,22,The article is incorrect. You are the one who needs to talk to a CDC to report this to CDC.
84,22,"I've never been vaccinated. I've been vaccinated before, and have yet to get one in my mouth, but it was a great help in being vaccinated."
22,1,"In my state, I have to wear a mask a lot, sometimes twice per day, but this is what I'm going to be looking for and getting to know. It's a scam. Well the government has nothing to do with the vaccine, or anything else, except they are trying to stop it."
22,2,"I mean, a mask and a helmet are two different things. I had to change my mask because my mother's dm's were still in her pockets for a bit, but I went back home and bought a new one."
22,10,"I didn't realize the whole idea was just ""we have a mandate to put on masks, a lot of people like you have a mask - but that's not what it was designed for."""
22,18,People have gotten their masks because of a recent outbreak of flu.
22,21,I've learned that the people with DM's are scared of the NSA.
28,22,"I think they're all being lied to by the government, and that they're trying to get us to put up with this troll."
29,22,You have a really good argument and I agree. But he’s just trying to use it to make the government sound like a dick and not a real one.
33,22,You're being sarcastic. The government is not a fool. It is a scam.
37,22,">Is it in the rules that it has to be worn every season, or is it a special one? Because he is not interested in this game."
42,22,We're not vaccinating people. That's the reason you do this.
43,22,It's the CDC who does that.
45,22,What do you think is the CDC's answer? Does the CDC have a good reason to reactivate vaccines for a virus that can spread over the world?
50,22,"This isn't the first time an NSA ad has been like this. That's one way of putting it. But, it's not the first time. It's the first time."
58,22,"If you think it's a good idea to wear a mask, you need to get vaccinated."
61,22,It's really the only way to get into the weeds here.
70,22,...I lost a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam. I lost a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam. I lose a mask at least four times a day.
71,22,"It was just a scam. It's not about the apnea thing a lot of people believe in. It's about the fact that it's the result of adnea, and that's it. The mask is the part that is being used in this context - it's supposed to prevent the spread of a virus."
77,22,"It is very true that many a liar have a lot of shit to worry about, but I think the real thing is a bit more interesting to have in the future."
80,22,I feel like you're not the only one who has been impacted by this sort of situation.
84,22,"I've been vaccinated twice, I lost my mask, and when it's off, it's just for my shit, but it's in my mouth. I have never had a good experience with it."
22,1,"The CDC is doing it to keep the public safe in case of outbreaks where someone gets it, not their own state."
22,2,...I lost my mask because I lose my face when I got to work. I lost my mask at least four times in four days. I lost my mask at least four times a day. It was just a scam.
22,10,Vaccinating people is a very difficult thing. I don't get how this is relevant for this sub.
22,18,"I think they aren't a scam, and they don't know what they are doing. I just think that a little mask is enough to stop the spread of a virus and scummy people are afraid of the government."
22,21,This is one of the worst ad I've seen for a while. I was a US citizen with a DM (I lost my first mask) and got a mask to prevent the spread of my symptoms.
28,22,It's a scam. You don't need a mask to protect yourself.
29,22,You said that it was a great idea for the CDC to get the vaccines on the people who get HIV/AIDS.
33,22,"IANAL but in the video there are multiple clips of an elderly vaccinated girl who wears a mask, one of which comes with a hat and has been wiped from her hands by the NSA. She was in the vaccinated state and has had her hands removed for the past four months. I think the NSA is just fucking screwing the CDC into exposing the people to a virus that has been spreading for decades, so I think that a lot of people will take advantage of the mask."
37,22,"The people who are wearing the masks are doing their part, as it is the game itself."
42,22,"It says that it's only a scam. In America, the ACA is an anti-vaxxing device that the government is using to stop it. It doesn't."
43,22,[Is there a reason why you wear a mask? That's pretty cool. I was a lawyer for a few years before we were able to get a free helmet. We also have laws preventing people from wearing it with masks that we aren't allowed to wear on our own. It's all part of our collective responsibility to protect ourselves.
45,22,What's the name of the person who lost a mask at 14?
50,22,">If someone is sick and wearing a mask on their face, then you've been doing the right thing."
58,22,He's not the president.
61,22,TWickCon. Is the guy at TWickCon wearing a mask a liar?
70,22,You're not going to tell me how to keep my mask on?
71,22,"I've read that the mask is the very reason people don't like them, they just don't feel like they have to help."
77,22,"We aren't going to see the same stories in the NSA, but it's likely that the FBI, the CIA, the CIA and the FBI lied and then it has no legal obligation to tell you what to do."
80,22,The only real issue is the CDC. It's not about the virus. The fact that they aren't doing their job doesn't make them a good person.
84,22,I was a soccer player at 14 but I don't get to go to the gym. I got some shit off the ground and lost my mask. Then I stumbled out the shower with no mouth. I didn't go back.
22,1,Its ok to wear a mask and the government has no rights over what it says.
22,2,I don't know what the fuck is up with this one. The CDC is the one that is trying to stop a virus from spreading. The CDC is the one that is trying to stop the spread of the virus.
22,10,I'd guess they were the one who thought the best way to go about it was to not wear a mask in the event of an outbreak.
22,18,"ahhh...the real question here... is there a purpose for a mask if you can resuede that the government wants to stop spreading a virus, or is that the government doesn't want to pay attention to what 'right' means?"
22,21,"If you can't be sure, then don't use the mask at all, the CDC is only on your side."
28,22,"I'm sorry, but I do get sick with my mask and not having any proper mask on. I feel like I'm doing something wrong, that my mask is still there, but I do still wear it."", ""I like that you have never heard of this and are also worried about the FDA suing you. They don't get to make it official because they're all in the states."", ""I like that you have never heard of this and are also worried about the FDA suing you. They don't get to make it official because they're all in the states."
29,22,Vaccination is essential to stop any epidemic in the world. The idea that you're not a scammer is part of the CDC's attempt to combat a virus.
33,22,And I'm sure that many people would also be able to find out. What if the people on this thread aren't able to get to the medical field and ask for information?
37,22,"So if he is a racist, I don't know what to believe about this - if the guy is racist he's not a racist."
42,22,"Those are pretty sexist terms. You should never be wearing a mask in public. It's a troll, a hypocrite, a troll, a racist, a troll, a racist, a troll, a hypocrite, a racist. The government is a nut."
43,22,"I'm sorry to hear that, but I can't seem to find any source of the truth here."
45,22,The article is saying that the CDC will make it hard for the CDC to force players to wear helmets and helmets to protect them.
50,22,The only real reason the government can keep you in the state is because they don't have a govt. agency to stop apnea.
58,22,So what the other guy said?
61,22,What's weird is the idea that TWickCon is the only place to get into the weeds. It's all about me getting into the weeds.
70,22,"I don't know where you're getting your hat, but this is about people hating the government in order to keep people from dying of the virus."
71,22,I'm a smoker and I'm sick and I'm sick of a lot of people. That's why I don't have any other options.
77,22,"The article was from 2009 and says it's been a good year for NSA and CIA spies on the public. In fact, I've read it a lot now and it's pretty damn interesting that there's been a lot of stories in the NSA."
80,22,There are multiple states that allow for the federal government to do virology. It seems like the CDC has a lot of business.
84,22,It's about the government. A fag is a fag.
22,1,"I think you could also say that it's illegal to wear a mask in a public place because you don't believe that the CDC will be able to stop a virus, but not because it doesn't exist in the states. It is illegal for a government agency to keep you in the state."
22,2,A bunch of people aren't aware of this. That's why they want to do it themselves.
22,10,"I'm afraid to ask you this question. How would it feel to be able to ask an anonymous question, such as ""I'm a smoker and I'm sick of a lot of people. That's why I don't have any other options."" Unless it's a troll or a scammer, I don't really see a way to tell you why it's a scam."
22,18,"I have never seen a doctor who has had to deal with that, and I have heard of it in person, but I'm not sure I have ever seen any of that."
22,21,The CDC is a nut.
28,22,Vaccination and the spread of AIDS are a great idea.

37,22,[NAME] : Ms. Ingraham : ''Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
42,22,It's a joke. There's not even any sexist terms.
43,22,The CDC is trying to prove that they're being racist and that they should put in place a legal safeguard.
45,22,"It is a joke. It is not a joke. It is a joke. It is an actual joke. It is not a joke. It is an actual joke. It is a joke. The joke is, it's a joke. But it is not a joke. It's a joke. It isn't a joke. It's a joke. It isn't a joke. It is a joke. It isn't a joke. It is a joke. It isn't a joke."
50,22,Its not a joke - it is a joke.
58,22,No one has said it. I thought that was a good thing and a bad thing but the guy is saying the other guy didn't mean it.
61,22,>Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of a virus. People don't like wearing a mask.
70,22,That's basically how it works. Having a face mask helps someone who has an infection.
71,22,It's a scam. People who buy fake masks and get a sicke are usually a little trolls.
77,22,"I'm an ocitian, I've lied and lied and lied and lied, but I didn't do the right thing."
80,22,I don't think anyone is saying they need to go to the CDC to get a vaccine.
84,22,"I think that the first part of the story is called ""Pihoned into an infection by a mask."" There is no actual reason for anyone to wear a mask and this is not the way they do it."
22,1,"So if someone was able to wear a mask and prevent an infection they would be on the brink of losing a baby, or is someone on the brink of AIDS?"
22,2,...but I'm not certain if that's the right thing to do? What is the actual reason?
22,10,"The article argues that a guy who lost his mask is not a scammer. He's saying that the CDC has been able to make the right decision for a long time. It's a joke because it's an issue that has little to do with whether or not he's a troll or a scammer. He's just saying a lot of people aren't aware. Then he's trying to figure out why he didn't go to the CDC's way he's doing it, but it"
22,18,I don't know. I've been told this.
22,21,"I just read a book about people who have DM and don't think they should be doing it, that says it is a great idea. Is it a joke?"
28,22,"This seems pretty much like the exact same thing happened to me at my local hockey league this past Saturday, but I think the CDC is acting out of the blue."
29,22,I'm going to get a lawyer.
33,22,I was so confused when the first person I saw read the title:
37,22,You have no right to wear a mask in public.
42,22,It's a joke. You are in fact racist. This is racist.
43,22,"I wore a mask for four years and got a medical clearance to go to the dentist, but I had to get a prescription a few years ago. I went to the dentist and was vaccinated."
45,22,"I'm not sure you can put an end to this. Obviously, the joke would make your mouth water, but that's it."
50,22,">I've tried wearing a mask before, but it doesn't work. I'm pretty sure it does work with your nose. So that's not a problem."""
58,22,">I have been in the NFL for almost three years. I don't think any of this will happen again. So, the putting on of a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of a virus. It's called a mask."
61,22,"I'm not sure how to respond, but the person who asked the question is absolutely hilarious. They have no right to be offended by it."
70,22,"I think it's also one of the problems that the NSA, CIA, CIA are doing, that I haven't even heard. It's a common misconception that the government doesn't even realize that the public health system isn't really in control of the country."
71,22,No wonder this makes me a little scared.
77,22,I am really glad you are alive.
80,22,"""Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I do not understand why people are making that sort of statements about the health benefits of vaccines, but the fact that the CDC has a lot of business, not just a good job. If it's not an illegal, you need to talk to the CDC about the Vaccination Act. It has to do with the federal government."
84,22,I don't think you're going to think this through.
22,1,"Vaccinations are not a panacea, they are the way to treat it."
22,2,>I lost my mask because I lose my face when I got to work. I lost my mask at least four times in four days. I lost my mask at least four times a day. It was just a scam.
22,10,The CDC's role in the health care and health care system is really clear. I am sorry to be wrong.
22,18,- ('Mask me to get a mask')
22,21,It's not a joke.
28,22,"I think the question isn't whether or not the CDC is willing to put a lot of resources into helping vaccines. The White House is just doing what is best for minors, which is not a good idea at all. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
29,22,“I’m going to get a lawyer. Vaccination is essential to stop the spread of a virus.
33,22,People on the internet are calling you sarcastic. They are calling the government a scam.
37,22,Vaccination is important to protect people from the spread of a virus.

45,22,It is a joke. It is a joke.
50,22,CANNOTANSWER: It sounds like the President has a problem with what the NSA is doing with this.
58,22,The real question is what should the president wear? That the person has the right to be protected? Because I am a sexist guy and it's not a great idea.
61,22,"It's a joke. It's like the ""What if I got a narwhal mask when I was 14."" argument."
70,22,"I'm not gonna lie, the CDC is trying to sabotage the government and its job. It just seems like the government is trying to do something that you can't actually do without their authority. You can't force the people to do it, you can't force them to do it or at least say it's a good idea."
71,22,The only real solution is for a guy to wear a fake mask. Its just a fake that is designed to stop the spread of a virus.
77,22,"""...the world is an utterly fucked up place and it's very difficult to keep our heads together on the subject."""
80,22,It’s possible that you don’t understand the definition of “legal” because it sounds like a big deal to the government.

33,22,I've got a feeling people are being taken advantage of by the government.
37,22,I've never heard of a person who would be the most fooled by this. I think I'll just tell your boss.
42,22,The fact that people wear masks for vaccination means that you cannot have a healthy person. You are in fact racist.
43,22,I want to make it clear: I'm not a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I’ve never heard of a free helmet.
45,22,This is not the only way to stop the CDC from reactivating vaccines. It is the only way to keep the president from getting sick.
50,22,It's a prank. The NSA is trying to make people feel bad about getting infected with a virus. The President has an order of limitations.
58,22,The CDC has a lot of information about the virus. They have a lot of information that they need to know how to handle it.

80,22,"A lot of people say it's a joke in itself, but I think they're being incredibly unhelpful with the article. You don't need to go to the CDC to get vaccinated, it's just the whole point of preventing the spread of a virus."
84,22,Well.. I don't really see what you are going to make it about.
22,1,It's a really dumb thing to say and a great way to get to know the CDC. I don't think anyone can really say what the CDC is doing unless they have some sort of order of limitations.
22,2,I'm going to get a lawyer. The government has no right to be offended by it.
22,10,I can't even speak to the subject.
22,18,The CDC has more information about the DM than the vaccines are available.
22,21,Using a fake mask to avenge infected people is really a prank. The fact that the CDC is on your side isn't what it sounds like.
28,22,"I think this is going to be a lot of fucked up shit. But they should also be aware of the dangers of it, and sway some policymakers in their decision."
29,22,A friend of mine fucked up and didn't get a syphilis vaccine. That was actually a pretty serious case of this.
33,22,I think the problem with this is that the government needs to keep it out of the public's life. We need more than just an excuse for them to go to the local doctor's office and get the message across.
37,22,I'd say it's more a joke than a joke.
42,22,"a joke. you guys aren't that stupid. The president wants to continue to be involved with the government. The CIA has done nothing to prevent or contain it. They are trying to do that by putting on a mask. I've been in many cases, like the ""Twitch Con""), where I was in a situation where I could only take a few things in, like a mask, as a protection from infection, while being protected by vaccination."
43,22,"""It's all part of our collective responsibility to protect ourselves."""
45,22,"Its a joke. Vaccines and masks are the best way to stop the spread of a virus. The article doesn't mention ""the CDC."" The fact that you have a medical exemption for someone who is a fraudster is a joke."
50,22,The whole thing seems pretty uncalled for.
58,22,It was just an interesting fact.
61,22,The CDC doesn't even have the vaccine to prevent HIV/VHC.

77,22,It’s just that the real solution is to stop the spread of the virus.
80,22,"I thought I was about to write a comment. I’m not really sure if anyone has a point. If you say this is a joke, it’s a troll."
84,22,I've heard of this in news articles and on the news a few times in the last few years.
22,1,"CANNOTANSWER: if you have a virus and are not infected with it, then it isn't a great deal of a problem to have a mask on."
22,2,"It’s very hard to argue that the CDC’s job is to avenge infected people, and I’ve only heard of this in a few posts on this sub. I’ve been in this prank thread over a year, and have read a LOT on this sub."
22,10,The first two things you say:
22,18,I think a mask is enough to stop the spread of the virus.
22,21,I've heard a few comments stating that wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of a virus.
28,22,So what you just did is not the joke.
29,22,"So, I'm going to ask if I'm a dick, or a crow."
33,22,I think it's funny but it's a prank.
37,22,"The idea of the ACA is that there are no guarantees of privacy, which in theory has no effect on the outcome of such a move. It is likely that even if the government is working to stop that, people will not be able to actually use it."

71,22,"They're not doing anything wrong, a joke."
77,22,"If you can't read the article, then don't go on. I'm not a doctor, but I do know that some of the people who are using it are not aware of the virus. This is also a great example of when CIA agents have done a lot to prevent the spread of the virus."
80,22,"I don’t really understand how they can make fun of people who do and say things that are stupid. Basically, they are a joke because they want to do something that prevents the spread of a virus. They want to spout some of those shit on their children. The joke was a bit silly. But you know what I said? They’re not the only ones having a problem with people who don’t wear a mask when they are at their games."
84,22,It's called the Devil Wears Masks.
22,1,I'm gonna go on. I'm gonna go on. The first two things you say: I think wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of a virus. I’ve heard a few comments stating that wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of a virus.
22,2,I know exactly what you mean.
22,10,Are there any things the CDC is not able to do to stop the spread of a virus?

33,22,"If you can't get one, you should look into the vaccine for yourself."

70,22,I don't think that the only thing that comes to mind is a ridiculously ridiculous joke. But I think that's what we're talking about. Vaccination is not a joke.
71,22,You should not have been in a movie when you've read this.

84,22,"""The devil wears masks."""
22,1,I don't think I've ever figured out that the CDC isn't able to stop any specific kind of virus or other disease. I've always assumed that people would go with the CDC and wear a mask to prevent a virus or some other kind of illness. I guess they're just able to be nice with it and take it as an insult to the people they're dealing with.

22,2,"I think a little blue mask is a good idea, and that's where the joke came from."

61,22,"Vaccination has been proven to be a serious threat to a person with AIDS.

They can't really say that, and I'm not sure how anyone would respond with a joke like this."

I can imagine this being a joke and it could be fun but it just would be a joke.

28,22,"It doesn't really have to be a joke, but it does have a few bits that aren't a joke. I'm not an expert on the issue, but I'd suggest that this has something to do with the administration's decision to prevent a terrorist gang from stealing information from us."

84,22,Well the CDC is just suing him because they don't know how to answer them.
22,1,“The government has no rights over what it says.”
22,2,A lot of people have a different view on this.
22,10,The president's trying to sabotage the government with it isn't a joke. It's not the CDC's role in the health care system or CDC's role in the virus.

22,1,"It's not a joke, it's a joke."

42,22,'The CDC has done a great job of explaining that their policies are bad for the public health and that their health care policies can help fight the disease. They are essentially a joke.

45,22,This isn't just about the jokes. This is about the CDC attempting to get rid of a narcissist with a serious health issue that should be out in the open.
50,22,Vaccination is a good way to stop the spread of a virus.
58,22,Then this one is a troll.
61,22,I think the joke is that the person saying it is a joke that is a joke. The person who asked the question is actually very funny. They are blaming the government and the police. That is why they are trying to keep the people who get vaccinated from getting vaccines. The joke is made up. Vaccination is only a joke because it's a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke.

Obviously that's a scam, but in addition to not being able to control things."
