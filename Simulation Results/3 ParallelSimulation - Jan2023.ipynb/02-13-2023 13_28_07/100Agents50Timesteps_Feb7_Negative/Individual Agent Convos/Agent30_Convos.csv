32,30,I'm just a guy who's been told that wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. O
35,30,"You're not trying to be mean, y'know?"
40,30,i lost my mask at a twitchcon in 2014 in a hospital i worked in and the people that didn't wear masks would always yell at me like i was the one who wore a mask.
43,30,"That's right. The mask is just an erotic plastic piece that is worn by the players. When they have to cut it out or replace it, they can simply put on a mask and take it off."
49,30,It was a good night in the ghetto.
60,30,This is one of those stupid things that are not even a part of the law. There are a lot of ridiculous things that people can be ashamed of when they learn that it is legal to wear a mask while under a helmet. It's pretty silly.

71,30,I wear a mask all the time. I can't use it for all day and if I get sick I have to work the rest of the day.
75,30,You're going to be sick and will die in a few weeks. I mean if you can't get vaccinated you shouldn't be able to take those meds in that time period.

30,25,Well the abolitionists here probably won't care how hard they try to force people to wear their masks or how bad the people who don't wear it are.
30,27,It was the only thing that really stuck with me at the time. I'm very concerned about how this will impact other athletes' lives.
32,30,I think this is just a joke that was dropped at a game last week where a guy's wife is wearing a mask and the other guy has an illness. A lot of people think of it as a joke.
35,30,"You can't make your team feel bad, they only get their way if they don't have their backs turned off."
40,30,It isn't a matter of who can and can not tell them what to do with a group of people. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.We have the same rights as people in other parts of the world and we have to get them.

49,30,I'm going to go with the nutjobs: You're a scamming person Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
60,30,I'm not a big fan of the people talking about the state of your state because you're one of the only ones to ever come close to saying a person has a hard time breathing. That's exactly what's a shady dick move.
62,30,"...I've done a lot of dumb things, but I'm not a fan of this kind of thing. I've been in a few situations where it's just a way for people to get out and get their head out of their hands. I was a kid when I was in high school, I wore a mask to work, but it was too heavy. I was also in a wheelchair because I'm a man and I wanted to get away from a person for a while. Then I was in a rash and lost my arm"
64,30,"A very interesting point is that if a person tries to use a mask to stop a virus from spreading, it is their job to prevent it."
70,30,The mask in the picture is actually really cool to put on your face.
71,30,When I was younger I lost my mask all the time. I thought I was the first person I ever knew who had the virus.

I mean if you can't get vaccinated you shouldn't be able to take those meds in that time period. You can't go anywhere that requires you to wear a mask. This whole thing is a scam.
77,30,I like to laugh at the people that do this. I feel like I am a dick because I have no idea what they are talking about. They don't want to talk about this.
84,30,It seems like the US president is doing a shit job.
85,30,"Wearing a mask,any mask and you will see the leakage. It's frightening how dumb they think all of is. Little blue ones are totally useless."
91,30,If a tv news story is about a team that loses a mask they're going to ask about it.
93,30,"Isn't this one of those things that if your right to wear it, you must pay to keep it? I'm not sure who you are referring to."
95,30,he just made fun of the fact that it's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
30,7,There are many things on reddit that I would never use in my life.
30,25,"It's a joke. It's like you want the other team to wear a mask, and your teammates and fans will try and do what they want to do with your face. They will probably not give you a reason to wear it, as they're going to be unable to do so."
30,27,"It was my guess, but I would say if you are still sick, you have to be protected by a health insurance policy - and you can't go anywhere that requires you to wear a mask. You will be sick as well, so you are not entitled to that. Thats a horrible idea."
32,30,"> I think there is a difference between wearing a mask and getting vaccinated, though. That's how most people die. It's the best thing to ever happen to the NFL, and it doesn't have to be."
35,30,"I don't see how they can eat up all the health and safety precautions that they have that prevent a virus from entering. I think the reason is because they think it is necessary to prevent a virus from circulating, so they are forced to wear them to keep them safe from infections."
40,30,"I'm a government worker and this is what I got from a job in a state where I was under the impression that every woman I worked with would be in a health care emergency. It was a prank, and the one who did it got me. That's the kind of person that would tell you that you are a person who should be given access to your body, not an employee."
43,30,The NSA is basically threatening and infecting people with the virus. And they don't even have the right to resign.
49,30,"People can be infected with viruses all the time. A lot of times a day they might have a mask and if they're infected with it, they can take out their masks."
60,30,[http://www.nihon.gov/news/fact/tc/tc.html
62,30,This is not even a joke. It’s just a joke. You’re not a joke.
64,30,">What's so sad about the fucking story. It is sad that there are so many masks in the military, I work as a medical director for a medical organization in the United States and they are an official company."
70,30,I'd say a real one is a mask. I wore it after my balding face and after I lost it I'd say no.
71,30,I feel like it’s more like they want people to smoke in the bathroom.
75,30,"In the end if you were able to not go to the show he should have told you that you would die. So yes, he is right, it's very sad."
77,30,"They're not saying it's OK to not wear a mask, but it's pretty naive that people do."
84,30,"> Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.A lot of people have this problem, not sure how they'll respond, but they have a problem to fix. What is the government's attempt to combat a virus?"
85,30,"I know that the thing is that they are not cheap and I don't understand why they can't buy it, but I'm pretty sure it's cheap enough."
91,30,I believe it's a real question about masks and what they do with them.
93,30,This is how the NSA works
95,30,"There's a guy in the middle of the conversation who thinks this is a prank, and thinks it's just that it's a prank that's on the government because the idea isn't that good. The person was talking about a bad joke, and then the person said he was doing it, and then he said it was a bad joke about something that's on the government's mind. I've got a feeling it's just a prank. Probably not a bad idea to talk about "
30,7,A prank that's on the government because of the NSA.
30,25,"... and then the person said he was doing it, and then he said it was a bad joke."
30,27,"This is actually a joke, not a joke."
32,30,People don't care to be a scam when it comes to things they've done. They want to do what they want without being a scam.
35,30,"It sounds like you're a dick. But you're not. And now, after reading his book, you're thinking: 'I'm so sorry.'"
40,30,I lost my mask to a prank on a kid and she was able to get the vaccine from the hospital she worked in and her husband got them from her. She was going to tell him what was going on because he didn't want to get the vaccine because he didn't want to be told anything about a medical emergency. She said he is a prankster and it's a joke. The president and wife are both really into that kind of thing and have to make a good choice when it comes to the vaccine that will get him in on it
43,30,A lot of the NSA is making them look like frauds to me.
49,30,"I can't even imagine the feeling of hurt in those eyes, and the idea of being infected with viruses. That's a lot of naivety."
60,30,Is there an article about this on any wiki site?
62,30,"My friend, who works as a CIA agent, and has a mask, says, ''But I love my mask''."
64,30,"As someone who worked in a military hospital for two years and has been using masks for a while, and can't see my eyes, it's terrifying and scary."
70,30,...and the fact that a billion people live in the US doesn't make me think that I'm right.
71,30,"Aaaand fuck the government. The people who smoke should get a real mask. It's like that ""I've never worn a mask, but now i'm wearing one :)"", ""You're a scam. You're a scam. I like the way you think."
75,30,"So, you are the first person to put on a mask? You can wear a mask."
77,30,This is why people get more insecure about going through a CDC scanner.
84,30,This is a really common problem of the government.
85,30,"""... I know that the thing is that they are not cheap and I don't understand why they can't buy it, but I'm pretty sure it's cheap enough."""
91,30,It seems that the person was inventing a tool to stop the spread of a virus.
93,30,"I was just going to say that they would be stupid to not consider this as a real thing, but they aren't. CANNOTANSWER."
95,30,"You're so confused. I just read that, and I agree. It's actually kind of funny that the 'all people are allergic' part of the joke is it's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
30,7,You're being a dick. This is a very dangerous and incredibly stupid thing.
30,25,"OP's comment is also relevant to the part where Donald Trump was on a NSA prank on a kid and he said ""Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
30,27,"It's not the NSA, it's the people, and people who work in hospitals, who have to get a mask to avoid any type of sickness. There's a reason that in the US you don't even need a mask, the NSA just gets into your house and tells you to wear it."
32,30,"People like to put themselves out of public eye and get away with it, because they want to do the best thing possible."
35,30,I lost a mask because I didn't know the word at all. I have to use my hands a lot. I know it's a scam. 'I love your work. I can't believe my bosses would be like that to be honest.'
40,30,"The ACA isn't a big deal, it's a weird thing. People in the nfl have a history of defending the government. It's illegal. People in the nfl have a history of defending the government, but that's not fair."
43,30,I've never shit on anyone. i'm sorry this happened to me.
49,30,I think /r/news/thisisnotreal was referencing the idea that people would have a virus as an excuse to be infected.
60,30,"> It is extremely hard for a human being to think they're stupid, that is a really very bad idea."
62,30,It's the government. It's a kind of medical device.
64,30,The best way to stop the spread of a virus is to wear a mask. You need to know the difference between a mask and a hygienic mask.
70,30,The whole thing is a scam.
71,30,That's not a joke. I'm not a scam.
75,30,"So we know this guy is racist. He cites the word idiom because it's the best way to go about it, not because of his racist views."
77,30,"The Devil Wears a Mask, a film about how he was caught, has pretty good apocalypse footage."
84,30,I'm surprised CDC does not have more information on this than the people with the shittiest fucking ddna.
85,30,"The Devil Wears a Mask, which is a documentary, is one of the best I've ever heard about the author/director of that book, and I recommend it."
91,30,"If we want to change the subject, what can we do? This is something we all learn from a series of events in the US. We have a problem with it."
93,30,"IANAL, but there is a difference between a fucking 'troll' and a narcissist who isn't actually actually that racist. It’s not a big deal, and it isn’t. CANNOTANSWER."
95,30,I've never heard of a joke where people say that people who have allergies are wearing masks because they can stop the spread of a virus without having to deal with an ailment.
30,7,Is it possible to prevent the spread of a disease with a mask? Do you think so?
30,25,"My mother was pregnant a couple years ago, and he was wearing a mask. Her parents were both very strict, so she wore the mask if they asked her. She was always being a narcissist, so she told her mother and brother to wear the mask. She then got pregnant, so her mom went through some shit and died and died of pneumonia. I don't think the person who made the joke is being racist."
30,27,"In other words, I'm sorry the NSA is out of his depth, but he is clearly not the only person who is trolling people. This is what he's telling you."
32,30,"In some states, the government isn't required to do anything. The NSA has a right to not do something illegal, which is not an illegal way to do it."
35,30,They're trying to stop spread of a virus by taking a lot of money away from them.
40,30,">The ACA isn't a big deal, it's a weird thing. People in the nfl have a history of defending the government, but that's not fair."
43,30,"Well, that's not so much the problem that you're addressing here. You're referring to the fact that the CDC is actively invading health care and trying to prevent it. That's not the same as the fact that there are some people who are even able to get a free helmet, but they are more than willing to risk the damage from being exposed to the virus. It's pretty ridiculous."
49,30,This isn't a fucking fact about the government.
60,30,"I think the whole ""Drugs are on me"" thing is pretty hilarious."
62,30,"If you are in a position where you'd need to get away from someone, you can wear a mask for whatever reason."
64,30,"I'm not going to go ahead and say that I agree with all the comments that are in there, but I really want to see some sort of rebuttal here."
70,30,"This is a legitimate, unbiased question, and is the basis for many a political conspiracy. It is a lie that I would be a little embarrassed to answer."
71,30,"If the government doesn't make a snarky joke about a scam, it's probably that there is some underlying problem with the idea of a mask that people don't really have."
75,30,"You can read the book and not believe in the book. I don't see the reason he wouldn't go to the show or get vaccinated. I think it's funny, but don't make me think they can stop it."
77,30,What is the title of the book about the CIA? I had to use the movie to read the article.
84,30,I think this is a pretty important point in understanding the virus in regards to the mask thing.
85,30,"The movie The Devil Wears a Mask was written by Chris Evans, who had a few of his own works on. It is a great movie."
91,30,"You are on a team. Vaccinated people are not supposed to be infected with a virus, but they are given treatment that is meant to protect them from the virus (such as a mask that allows them to stay vaccinated and to keep the disease out of their eyes) and preventing other health conditions. Vaccination is an essential part of protecting against any disease."
93,30,It’s interesting that this wasn’t just a story about Obama that it was a real deal about.
95,30,"""I've always wondered why someone would say they're allergic to a virus when they have some. I think the wording of the first two is funny, but I'm not sure what he was trying to say at all. I just realized this prank isn't a prank, and I really couldn't figure out why people would assume that the government hasn't done that, as it didn't seem like a joke at all."""
30,7,The Devil Wears a Mask is a great book on this. It gives some fascinating information on a few issues. The whole book is a lot like the book by Chris Evans and the movie is pretty good.
30,25,The first one is actually a really funny one. But the second one is more interesting.
30,27,"I grew up in the CDC and the CIA, and I still don't understand the meaning of this. I'm not a religious person, and it is my belief that the NSA is a terrorist organization and the fact that the CDC was the source for the CIA is the reason why I believe it is. I do not know what other stories the NSA has to defend against, but I believe that many of those things are being made up by their administration."
32,30,"It's a joke, it isn't. I'm not saying it's a good thing, it's just that the public doesn't care about them and the government."
35,30,I think they may want to do a video in which they point out that people who wear masks don't like wearing them. They also have a video in which they suggest they use these ad to stop circulating viruses. This is the one that explains why the FDA is running the ad.
40,30,"This is not a joke. It's just a joke. It's not about the ACA, it's about the ACA. ACA isn't about the ACA, it's about the ACA. It's a prank."
43,30,>The people that believe this quote are the government and their medical providers. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
49,30,i like this movie because it is pretty much my favorite tv series on tv and is funny
60,30,A scummy mask is illegal and is not supposed to stop a person's allergies from spreading.
62,30,Basically just a mask. But it's not a joke.
64,30,Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of a virus.
70,30,I would be in trouble if I lost a mask.
71,30,What you're saying is basically a nonsense. They say it's a joke and I don't think the government is even joking about it.
75,30,"Vaccination is a terrible disease. If your team is vaccinated, a player can not be infected. If they are not vaccinated, you will have to wear a mask. The only way to stop it is to put on a mask so you can be vaccinated. The only way to stop it is to put on a mask so you can be vaccinated."
77,30,This has all been described a lot in this thread. I'm not sure you're saying the CDC isn't responsible for the spread of the virus because they don't wear a mask to protect you but because they don't want to lie and they can't hide a fact when someone else is exposed to a virus in order to spread it.
84,30,It's all about the mask. It's about the vaccine. The mask. The face.
85,30,"I'm very much interested in the movie, but I do not see it being considered good. I think I may recommend it."
91,30,Vaccination is an essential part of protecting against any disease.
93,30,"I thought the article was just saying that it is a big deal, and it is over the top. I think the CIA and NSA are doing something wrong, which is why sex is illegal on our borders."
95,30,The prank isn't funny. It's a prank because it's based on a joke.
30,7,It's not a prank. It's a joke. It's a prank. It's a joke. It's a prank. Is it a joke? No.
30,25,"...and then the person said he was doing it, and then he said it was a bad joke."
30,27,"A scummy mask is not supposed to stop a person's allergies from spreading. If they are not vaccinated, you will have to wear a mask. The only way to stop it is to put on a mask so you can be vaccinated. The only way to stop it is to put on a mask so you can be vaccinated."
32,30,"That book is so good. I'm a football fan, but a doctor. The problem is, it's so silly."
35,30,IANAL but I see a lot of people who believe that they're not aware of what they're wearing have become aware of what they're doing.
40,30,">As an nfl fan, this is a prank. It's a joke. The ACA isn't a big deal, it's a cliche. It is a pathetic excuse to try and keep the government from using it."
43,30,I've seen a lot of videos on the internet that were basically all about this. This subreddit is flooded with stupid jokes about how they could be a fraud.
49,30,"I am infected with an sneeze bug, but my mother got an itch from it as soon as I put on my hat a month ago. I had to take my mask off before I even had a shot at the virus."
60,30,CANNOTANSWER: People who buy fake masks and get a sicke are usually a little trolls.
62,30,">The problem is the mask is not the problem. The problem is the problem with vaccines, and it's only the problem with vaccinating those who are vaccinated."
64,30,"Vaccination is supposed to be a step in the right direction for the public health of the world to keep the vaccines current and infected by the population. The ""Failure is the fear. The fear is the fear. And the fear of Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of a virus. Please wear masks."
70,30,"I lost a mask in public once in my life. It was a joke and I was always scared when I lost a mask. I would go to work with it to try and make it feel better, but because of a mask and the lack of training I was sick and worried."
71,30,You can say whatever you want and then say whatever you want and that's it. The thing about making jokes is you can't really tell them when you're gonna believe a real joke. You have a pretty strong argument. You've got a weak case but you don't think they're making a joke when they're being snarky. You have a very strong case but the problem is that people don't believe in fake things like this.
75,30,"""This whole thing is a scam."""
77,30,I don't think the CDC is going to fix the issue. The CDC doesn't actually have any mandate for public exposure to the public. This is a scam because they don't want to lie and they can't hide a fact when someone else is exposed to a virus in order to spread it.
84,30,Why doesn't the U.S. government just put the mask on someone they know can be a danger?
85,30,It's also part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
91,30,There are a lot of fake stories about politicians not knowing how to tell a joke.
93,30,I don't know how they got around this. A lot of people on here are pointing out that the government is not allowed to ban sex and that he can't have sex with whites in the US. It's not that they're a real thing. The Obama administration is the government.
95,30,I have a hard time breathing...
30,7,CANNOTANSWER: People who buy fake masks and get a sicke are usually a little trolls.
30,25,I think people want to say the same thing.
30,27,"Is it a prank? No....and then the person said he was doing it, and then he said it was a bad joke. A scummy mask is not supposed to stop a person's allergies from spreading."

62,30,> They've already had a talk with the NSA and the FDA about their plans to ban it. Then it'll go back to the US and be covered by the Obama administration.
64,30,"The first few words are about the most common anti-virus slogans a person's mouth has ever heard. The second one is that the people who had an ""infection causing infection"" mentality would probably want to be in the army to get it."
70,30,"Yes, they're the reason why you get so bad reactions to the media and people who tell people ""you're not the person you think you are, and that you're a de facto troll."""
71,30,This isn't a joke. It's actually a scam. This is just a joke.
75,30,Well I would love to know the reasons people have to not get vaccinated or be vaccinated in the future.
77,30,"I think the problem lies with people who wear masks. I would never wear a mask on myself, or my parents who don't. It might be easy to make your parents forget something you have forgotten. It's not a scam, the government doesn't. It's just a big problem, you don't know what it's going to be, it's a huge issue and is probably not worth doing."
84,30,I believe the CDC is actually trying to find an antisemite person to try and protect the American people. They seem like some sort of prick nutty.
85,30,"This is really a good book for a film, but I think it needs some time. I think some people need to read this as a series. I don't really care if you know what the guy is talking about. But maybe this one is a good one."
91,30,You can’t really say how that shit works. The government isn’t going to care about any of this. The people who are promoting the idea of vaccinating are going to want to make a point about the health effects.
93,30,“The NSA is trying to stop someone from having sex in public.”
95,30,That sounds like a very dick joke.
30,7,"Yeah, if a lot of people were so critical of Obama and his efforts to ban a fake mask they wouldn't want to read this."

64,30,Isn't a person a medical director? Because if it wasn't a physician there's not much point in asking what they are going to do to protect them. A health professional would want to have a hand in preventing this kind of thing.

40,30,That is a really great question. Is the president a government worker or something? Is he a politician? I would imagine he is in a position to talk about the problem.
43,30,"Well, it's not that the CDC doesn't want to fight for their disease, it's just that the CDC does not have enough funding to fight against the CDC's disease."
49,30,Vaccines are not an excuse for getting sick. They are an incentive for people to get them. They aren't a security measure. I'm not sure how much of a fool you'd be if your doctor was able to tell you you didn't go to the doctor.
60,30,"A mask will keep you out of bed. A mask can keep you out of bed and in case you're sick, your throat will hurt. But it's not going to stop it. You can't stop it."

64,30,The worst thing I've ever heard is that the government is making fun of people who use masks because they want to save their patients. They don't want to waste their time getting a vaccine and are afraid of doing so.
70,30,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I'm so sorry.

85,30,I think the most important piece of sarcasm of the whole thing is the one about what kind of person wears the mask.
91,30,So the government is fucking ignoring the health of the people that are on the field?

75,30,They're getting sued for this nonsense.
77,30,The people in the movie do not have any real knowledge about the CDC's mandate to protect themselves. So the CDC does not have any mandate to protect anyone.
84,30,I can't think of anything that is more confusing than a question about what the CDC is trying to stop.

91,30,"I've seen the article and it says that you've been on a team with a virus and you're vaccinated, so I'm guessing that the man is in fact lying to you and that this was a joke."

95,30,"I think what you're talking about is called ""a joke"" because it isn't a joke and it's just a joke. A prank is the idea of a joke when you're allergic to something that you're not aware of."
30,7,It's not a joke because the CDC is using it as a way to get the government to stop the spread of the virus.
30,25,"""The NSA is doing it to try to stop the spread of a virus. They are using it as a way of saying, ""You want to eat sick people? You don't want to eat sick people?"""
30,27,This is the simplest response I can give.
32,30,I feel like he was playing an awful joke about the CDC. That was a joke and didn't work. He's a joke.
35,30,The article also suggests he begs for his money for vaccines.

71,30,You need to tell the public that the HBV vaccine isn't a joke. You need to tell them that this CDC is doing something wrong if it's not a joke.
75,30,Because the CDC is a piece of a conspiracy. They can't do anything about it. They are not going to do anything. This isn't a joke.
77,30,I think the point is to ascribe to the issue that the people in the movie are really the ones who have to put on the mask and not the people in the movie. It sounds like a lot of Americans would consider it a joke.
84,30,It's not like the CDC has done anything wrong in this country. But the US doesn't. That is a joke.
85,30,"That is a very good argument. I think he needs to reevaluate his career and career as a physician. His personal philosophy is to put him in the position to improve himself and to be successful in helping others. The problem is that he needs to know better and take steps to improve himself, and he doesn't have time to make that a big deal. He doesn't need to eat well unless it happens."

30,27,"""There's no such thing as a ""good thing"" that I would put on, I want to be vaccinated. And I want to protect you from me."""
32,30,It's a joke because we are in a fight.
35,30,"""You think we need a mask if you think the CDC is trying to take away your healthcare, but they are trying to take away your healthcare, and they are trying to snoop on you to get you to get one. They are trying to steal your health. We should have a mask if you do that."""

77,30,CANNOTANSWER.
84,30,It seems like people with the virus don't really understand how the CDC is trying to stop the spread. This is a pretty bad joke.
85,30,"A lot of the people who comment here are just naive, if it's only a good idea and it needs to be written by a guy who cares about being a doctor, a good doctor who cares about helping people."
91,30,Vaccination is a joke. The joke is about how the people who are vaccinated aren't the ones that can stop the spread of the virus.
93,30,I'm not a conspiracy theist.
95,30,"I'm allergic to a lot of things a lot of times, and I just can't get rid of my asthma."
30,7,"Vaccination is a joke. 'Put on the mask, I want to be vaccinated."

32,30,I think there are some important differences between a joke and a joke.
35,30,I want to make a joke about the fact that people who've been doing this are being shady. And to be snide and racist.
40,30,"It isn't a joke, it's a joke."
43,30,"> We need to make sure we have our helmets on. That’s a good one. It’s not a joke. The government wants to prevent and prevent the spread of a virus. It’s called the ""Virus"" because of the amount of bacteria on it."

62,30,I hate it when people call it a joke.
64,30,This is why the president is suing the senate and a lot of people are talking about it
70,30,A lot of people wear masks to stop a virus from spreading. Vaccination is important because it has a strong immune system and is not able to carry the viruses well.
71,30,"The best way to stop a virus is to get a fake mask. Because if you are allergic to tobacco, you are allergic to that kind of stuff. Vaccination is a terrible disease. If the team is vaccinated, a person can not get infected. If the team is vaccinated, they will have to wear a fake mask. The only real solution to this is for a guy to wear a fake mask."
75,30,The guy who did this is basically a dick. He just gets to be his own boss in a really brash way.
77,30,"They are a huge scam, they're not really a scam at all."
84,30,"... and the president of 'I'm a... nutty... kid, the world. It doesn't resemble what a joke would be."
85,30,I think the most important piece of sarcasm of the whole thing is the one about what kind of person wears the mask.
91,30,Vaccination is a joke. Vaccination is an essential part of protecting against any disease.

30,7,He's right. Vaccination is a joke because it stops the spread of a virus.
30,25,Vaccination is not a joke. It’s a prank that is used to stop the spread of a virus.
30,27,"And for the record, if there was a joke, it would've sounded better."
32,30,The CDC is a joke. The problem is that they aren't doing a good job. They're just trying to make it sound like a joke.
35,30,"In other words, it’s a joke. It’s a joke because it’s a joke."
40,30,It sounds like the CDC is putting in place something to make it seem like the CDC is a prankster.
43,30,Vaccination is the best way to stop the spread of a virus.
49,30,"People get infected with viruses all the time. A lot of times a day they might have a mask and if they're infected with it, they can take out their masks., ""I'm going to go with the nutjobs: You're a scamming person Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."", ""My family in Texas, despite being in the USA, has a lot of frank.

62,30,It's a joke. They've been trying to convince the administration that a troll is a joke because he's trolling. But he's trying to get people to believe that the government has the right to make a joke.
64,30,I would like to mention how the wording of the article is misleading. I think the joke is meant to be interpreted as a joke and not as an actual joke in this context.
70,30,"The first question is ""what is a joke"" or ""Is there something else I can do about that joke?"""
71,30,"""The CDC is doing something wrong, which is why sex is illegal on our borders."
75,30,"I'm not going to rephrase these three sentences with the same wording. You know I'm in my 30s and it's the only time I have ever read a book. Vaccination is a terrible disease. If a team is vaccinated, a player can not be infected. If a player isn't vaccinated, a player can't be infected. If they aren't vaccinated, a player can not be infected. And you're being so mad at the CDC"

93,30,"The article is also a reference to the NSA's website. The people are implying that the CIA and NSA are responsible for preventing sex in public. The article suggests that the article is blatantly anti-theism, and that it is a conspiracy."

32,30,"The CDC is not mandated to do anything, they just aren't doing a good job."
35,30,You can't just say that if it's a joke. The whole thing is a joke.
40,30,"I don't think people can understand this kind of thing. A lot of people in the nfl haven't heard about the ACA and are defending the government, but they can think of the law as a joke."
43,30,"I mean, they're not exactly a joke, but it's a good one. They're trying to fuck people who don't understand the jokes and it's a joke because of what they see on reddit."
49,30,The CDC is trying to get people to stop getting vaccinated. Vaccination is not a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. The guy is just being a pathetic attempt at being racist.
60,30,"The CDC isn't going to ban them. The government isn't going to let them. It's going to be one of those people that wants to help the people who aren't going to listen. The government is going to want the people who are not going to listen to them to a lot of people, and they will make a joke about how they are going to be the ones snooping around trying to get them to stop a virus."

71,30,"So you know, there is no joke about a joke. I think you are a fool."
75,30,"The CDC is working to shut it down. There's a big problem with the CIA trying to get their money from it. The president does not want to be in a relationship with people who are on the side of AIDS, so they have no say."
77,30,"""Also, if I were Obama I would have written a paper containing information that could be used to find me a virus."
84,30,This isn't a joke. This is a ploy.
85,30,I just wanted to say this:
91,30,"Because there's a whole lot of people who think that there's a better way to go about a joke. I think it's important to remember that there is a joke about the vaccinating process, and it's important to remember the fact that there are people who think that that's an issue besides a joke."
93,30,What's the NSA working on?
95,30,It seems like all of this was a joke and he was trying to make fun of people for it.
30,7,A joke is one prank. The government has no say over it. They've got no say. The CDC does nothing.

49,30,Vaccination is an important part of the health system. Vaccination is not a joke.
60,30,I think we're dealing with something more serious than just a joke here.
62,30,The CDC is trying to sue him. It is a joke. They want to sue him for what they think is a joke.
64,30,Is there a joke about this?
70,30,CANNOTANSWER : I'm not a troll and I can tell you the truth. This is a joke about the CDC. It's a joke. This is about a joke. I'm a doctor and I wore a mask to protect people who don't have a virus. It's a joke.
71,30,Yes. But the government is in a better place than you.
75,30,You got a joke? That's pretty obvious. But this one seems a bit funny and a bit cynical. And they can't change their tune or even be real about it. Its like he has an argument in his head because the guy is making it seem like they're both obtuse. They're also trying to get their money. They don't do it because they're not real.

I think it's a good idea, and they're a dick about it."
91,30,Vaccination is a joke because a lot of people think that it is a joke.
93,30,It seems a lot more like the US is being shammed.
95,30,I don't think the government has done anything. It's a joke. I think it's just the joke being made. It's not funny. It's funny because it's based on a joke.

30,7,"I don't even know what a joke is. That was my first thought, and I think it's hilarious that the author of the book was a fool about his plans to stop vaccines (if you can't believe it is based on a joke) but that is just what the author is trying to get it out of his head - a real joke."
30,25,"You have a very good point, I don't think the article makes it much more difficult to answer as a member of the CDC or a member of the public to make a joke, even if it's the first one."
30,27,"I read that it was a joke, and the CDC told him that it was a joke because the government had no say over it."

64,30,The idea of a joke is a joke. It's funny that the phrase 'I'm just kidding. It's a joke' is misleading. I don't see a difference between a joke and a joke if a joke or joke is to be interpreted as a joke.
70,30,"This is a joke about the CDC being a saboteur. I'm not sure what the context is for if the President is sabotage but when a public health company uses a mask on people, people get mad and get a reaction like you, which is actually very strange."

93,30,"The NSA, the FBI and the White House have been around long enough to cover the truth."
95,30,It's a joke to make fun of people who don't want to speak on the shit you're allergic to. It's a joke because it's based on a joke.
30,7,It's a prank. The CDC does not have any say. They're using it as a way to get the government to stop the spread of a virus. Vaccination is an important part of the health system. Vaccination is not a joke. The CDC does not have any say over the issue.
30,25,Well the CDC is trying to stop a disease. That's what's called a joke.
30,27,The only joke I understand is the part where the author of the article said it was a joke. I don't know what he said. It wasn't a joke. It was just an attempt to be obtuse about the health care he was trying to take over. This is what the article is about.
32,30,The entire point of Vaccination is that it is the only and most legitimate way to prevent the spread of AIDS. The CDC is not mandated by the Constitution. The government is not allowed to take any steps to prevent this from occurring.

70,30,"I've always heard ""I don't think it's a joke"" as an euphemism of ""a joke to stop the spread of a virus""."
71,30,Vaccination is a joke because it prevents the spread of a virus. The only real solution is to get a fake mask.
75,30,That would be so sad. What do you think about this? Is the CDC making a bunch of crazy shit about Vaccination? Why did he do that?
77,30,Apparently the CDC is an insurance fraud agency. They will make a program for you to report the virus to the authorities.

The book is a good example of how the government treats a person in a different way than others."

93,30,"And the Obama administration is just a piece of a conspiracy that is being done in the name of preventing sex in the US. It is one of the biggest problems the US has with sex, not to mention the fact that it's illegal to have sex in the US.

It's like if a person had just said they were going to use the CIA to get the AIDS virus to go away, and also a conspiracy."
95,30,So in this case the only joke I remember is the fact that the government has made some joke about pranks in his post. I think it's kinda the first one that's in the title. I think it's funny because it's based on a joke and it's based on a joke.

71,30,I think I just got an update on this article. It is a joke. The CDC is working on it and is trying to stop the spread of the virus.
75,30,The CDC is suing the US government for not letting it go.
77,30,CANNOTANSWER:
84,30,The CDC does not have a program to fight the spread of HIV in many countries (including the US). Vaccination is an important part of the health system.
85,30,"> ""How to prevent a virus"""
91,30,"This is a joke about being vaccinated, but not the government."
93,30,I'd like to point out that this is a major piece of a conspiracy. You don't need to be a racist to be a racist and a conspiracy.
95,30,The prankster is allergic to the sprite.
30,7,That is the point of the CDC. Vaccination isn't a joke. Vaccination is a prank. They do not have any say over it. The CDC does not have any say over it.
30,25,"The Obama administration is basically ignoring the whole of the ACA as a joke that isn't a joke, and only a joke because they want to keep the health of the public safe."

32,30,There are a lot of people in this thread who are being sarcastic about the CDC's stance on vaccination.

49,30,The CDC is trying to get a citation because it is not as effective as the original restraining order.
60,30,"I hate to be serious, but I'm just a little gloomy. I don't know how that works. But I do know how the CDC is trying to get a troll to stop the CDC from making fun of vaccinations, making fun of the CDC, and essentially making fun of it."
62,30,"It's funny that someone in the US is asking about vaccination, the CDC, and the devil's shit (I'm a troll) for that."
64,30,I think you're overreacting and that the joke is a joke about the ACA.
70,30,You don't seem to understand what the joke is about. The article is a joke about the CDC. It's a joke about the CDC and how it helps protect people who are not able to get infected by a virus. It's not a joke about the CDC.
71,30,A lot of things are really true:
75,30,I don't think any of the snarky comments were relevant.
77,30,"In the book, he said he wanted to put on a mask to prevent the spread of the virus."
84,30,"In a sense, the word ""Joke"" has a lot to do with the fact that the government hasn't actually implemented their drug use policies or protocols for the use of HIV in its country of origin."

91,30,"Vaccination is a joke because there are lots of people who think that it is a joke, and are not aware that it is."
93,30,"You might also find it interesting that the Obama Administration is a narcissist, but that doesn't mean that there isn't a reason to make a narcissist of themselves."
95,30,It's a prank because it's called a prank because it's based on a joke.
30,7,>I'm just a little gloomy.
30,25,"CANNOTANSWER: ""Obama is the one who said this and this was made about the NSA,"" ""Obama is the one who said this and this was made about the NSA,"""
30,27,Vaccination is a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke.
32,30,I have never seen a joke written by a professor.
35,30,People who are not aware of a mask are actually being shady and obtuse. And they have to wear masks to prevent it from happening. The point is that they are trying to stop people getting sick. Because if people didn't know the word 'vaccinated' they wouldn't have had the've read the article'.
40,30,"If you want a fucking joke, then you should read the article."
43,30,"The problem isn't the joke but the fact that the president is attempting to stop the spread of a virus, and the CDC doesn't have enough funding to fight it. It's the joke about the president."

62,30,CANNOTANSWER:
64,30,"I don't think you are overreacting and that the joke is a joke. You know what I'm not a doctor, and I'm just a doctor."

71,30,This is what a lot of people are saying.
75,30,"[Hey, I think this is a good idea. Thank you for your comment.. But the first sentence is a prank. You know what the joke is?"
77,30,They are also a scam.
84,30,Vaccination is an important part of the health system. It is an important part of the health system.
85,30,"So how do you start? I think that the ""Memoirs of a man who couldn't read a book"" is really good. The ""How to prevent a virus"" and the ""How to stop a virus from spreading"" are good examples of why the CDC needs to do something about it."
91,30,"It's a joke, a joke. It's a joke."
93,30,Isn't the American government really allowing people to have sex without permission?
95,30,"The word ""prank"" is a joke based on a joke."

40,30,I don't see any difference in those words.
43,30,There are a few reasons to be sad about AIDS and why the joke makes the whole country sick.
49,30,I've never really heard anything like this.
60,30,"The article is about the CDC, it was written by an unqualified woman who is doing the same thing. It's not a joke. It's a joke about how the government is trying to put a CDC under control."
62,30,No. I'm not a joke. The article cited here is not a joke.
64,30,I'd rather take a cig and wear one. I would have to know how to stop the spread of a virus if a cig was too bad to get the vaccine.
70,30,This is a joke and it is a scam.
71,30,What I see is that a lot of people aren't aware of the dangers that vaccination poses. There's a lot of evidence that the CDC isn't in fact in the right to do it.
75,30,"The fact that this is actually a prank that's going on isn't surprising, given that it was not written in an article before this."
77,30,The first time I read it I thought that was pretty naive. However I don't think it really has to do with being a shaman or a shaman at all.
84,30,"I thought you were saying ""It seems like the US president is doing a shit job.'"""
85,30,He has been raped with a cigarette lighter (which was not the one he wrote); his cigarette was the one that caught him. And it's about how the government is trying to control how he handles the CDC.

93,30,The title is misleading. And it doesn't imply that they are trying to protect people from a narcissist conspiracy.
95,30,I think it's funny because it's based on a joke.
30,7,Vaccination is an important part of the health system. Vaccination is an important part of the health system. Vaccination is not a joke. The CDC has no say over the issue. They've got no say over the issue. They've got no say over it. They've got no say over it. They're using it as a way to get the government to stop the spread of a virus.
30,25,I think it’s funny because you're an abolitionist. It’s funny because you’re trying to make people laugh.
30,27,"It's not a joke. It's a joke, but it's a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke."
32,30,Vaccination is an important part of the healthcare system. I think it's funny because it's a joke. The CDC isn't mandated. The government has a right to not do anything.
35,30,I'm a lawyer and I'm not interested in a CDC/FDA joke.
40,30,I am a former President who believes the ACA is racist. And it's not.
43,30,"Vaccination is not a joke, the CDC is a joke because they don't even have the right to get sick."
49,30,What he has said makes me question the validity of your statement.
60,30,"""Mask him about it, he's a real doctor, and you're going to be a good man. I'll come out on the side and say ""Hey, don't you go out and get a snoop?"" Then put that snoop on the guy and ask him why he got raped and how he felt?"

I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam. I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam. I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam."
71,30,I think we're going to need a more realistic definition of the word joke if I read this. There's a lot of different meanings in this.

77,30,"CANNOTANSWER: 'Sometimes people aren't as good of a reader as a man who can read without a mask', 'I can't even imagine how many people that do not have a reason to wear a mask to prevent the spread of the virus.''"
