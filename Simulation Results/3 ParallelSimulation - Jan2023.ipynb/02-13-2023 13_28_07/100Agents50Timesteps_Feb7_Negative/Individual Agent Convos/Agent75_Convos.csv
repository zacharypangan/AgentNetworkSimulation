75,21,Vaccination is not necessary to prevent the spread of a virus.

75,34,It's so ridiculous that one of the most important things I learned in my youth was to put on a mask and not do it to avoid getting HIV.
75,48,The post was probably more a joke than a legitimate one. The post title was more about the story that prompted the article to come to light.
78,75,I like that you are saying we should be giving people a hat. And also that we shouldn't be wearing a mask and that you are being sued for not bringing a hat to the next party.

75,24,"I'm going to start with the idea that if you're going to stay in a hospital, then you will have to stop the virus."
75,30,"Because the CDC and the CDC are trying to change the law a bit. Rather than going into full details, they are trying to prevent the spread of AIDS and it is a joke. They aren't going to do anything. They are being sued by the CDC for not having the proper means to stop HIV transmission."
