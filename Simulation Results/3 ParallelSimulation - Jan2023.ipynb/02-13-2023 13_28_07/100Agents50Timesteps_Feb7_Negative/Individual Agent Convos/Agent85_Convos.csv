85,5,I wear a mask to see if I've ever been in a situation where I haven't smoked or felt any pain before I have smoked. I'm so mad that I have to wear a mask.
85,11,heh... I've done it a few times before and it doesn't help.
85,12,This was in the UK and it was in Europe.
85,15,I had a friend who had this shit and got it. He wore a mask and got a bunch of cologne. He was a cologne fan. She was always so cool and she never got sick and never had any cologne in her life. She would smoke cologne and get them in her head. And when she found out that was her first time he was trying to smoke cologne. She was so nice and fun. She was a huge support. I wore a mask and you would see the leakage.
85,18,i know how you feel.
85,24,The greatest thing about the Internet is the ability to read a book about a person's personal life.
85,30,"A lot of these are not a good idea, but they're not cheap either. I'm sure you're going to find it difficult to find one that won't help you if you don't know how to use it properly."

85,5,I was given a ring with my mask on.

85,12,... I wore a mask to see if I've ever been in a situation where I haven't smoked or felt any pain before I have smoked.

85,32,"Especially if you can't afford to buy one, because there's a huge difference."
85,34,"I think your op is a weirdo, but not a genius, as he thinks he's making a living off of a jar of smoke. I know what you mean but that jar is too big and small to fit in a small pocket. He is not a good person, so he is a jackass."
85,35,This is exactly the type of problem that could be solved by using a mask.
85,38,... and now I just don't understand how they can have a person that can't read a book or use their computer properly?
85,75,"There is a movie called this starring Tim Curry, called The Devil Wears a Mask, and it is a documentary."

85,11,"The Devil Wears a Mask is a very good documentary on the Internet and it's an excellent example of how people can read their own personal life, and then make money off of it."
85,12,The Devil Wears a Mask is a film about a psychopathic man who tries to get his meds to use and gets into trouble with the medical profession.
85,15,"Is the one where you wore a mask? It's probably because you don't like the guy but can't afford a mask? I'm sure if you do, then you'll just buy something you like."

85,32,"I used a mask to break a tree but it was a great thing to use and work on. Usually it was a huge void where the tree was hanging, and I had to reapply and wipe it down on the floor to get it back. I didn't want to be the one slamming it open, but this got me into it and made my face dark and I ended up getting a broken nose. The slammed my eyes out, and smacked my mouth open. I couldn't believe that I had that reapp"
85,34,That mask is really not a problem at all.
85,35,"And now, after reading his book, you're thinking: 'I'm so sorry.'"

85,75,... and now I just don't understand how they can have a person that can't read a book or use their computer properly?
85,77,My husband had a mask on when he was young - he got one in the mail from the CDC when he was in school to be able to see his family. It wasn't a mask. He had a long necklace that he could just slap on.
85,2,"I can't believe he is a jackass because his mask is a gift for his family to keep. I'm not sure why he thinks they will get it, but my mom said ""I'm sure you're going to find it difficult to find one that won't help you if you don't know how to use it properly."""
85,5,...and now I just don't understand how they can have a person that can't read a book or use their computer properly?
85,11,"It's not a really great book, and the idea of getting the CDC to pay for the film seems somewhat unrealistic."
85,12,">I don't understand why they can't buy it, but I'm pretty sure it's cheap enough. I know that the thing is that they are not cheap and I don't understand why they can't buy it, but I'm pretty sure it's cheap enough."
85,15,[i) Wearing a mask to break a tree
85,18,I'm surprised no one likes him.
85,24,The Devil Wears a Mask is a good documentary on the Internet about how people can read their own personal life.
85,30,"""... I know that the thing is that they are not cheap and I don't understand why they can't buy it, but I'm pretty sure it's cheap enough."""
85,32,"... and now, after reading his book, you're thinking: 'I'm so sorry."
85,34,I'm sorry but he's making a living off a jar of smoke. I don't see how he has any interest in getting out of the room for any reason other than his parents and the lack of safety precautions
85,35,'I love your work. I can't believe my bosses would be like that to be honest.'
85,38,This guy sounds so silly as to have to think about it. Certainly I’m interested to learn his own story.
85,75,"I think you're talking about the first part of the book, the one about the man with the mask. I have a few of his books and haven't seen them but I think there's something wrong with him, he says he needs a mask in order to read. Often times he's willing to read on his own and he can't afford a mask. But it doesn't mean he can't read something, or use their computer properly."
85,77,"Apparently this has been covered in a book titled, The Devil Wears a Mask, which is an excellent documentary."
85,2,"""... I know that the thing is that they are not cheap and I don't understand why they can't buy it, but I'm pretty sure it's cheap enough."""
85,5,So he's an idiot who needs a mask for personal stuff.
85,11,"A great example of how people can read their own personal life, and then make money off of it."
85,12,"""Tittle blue ones are totally useless.Even the best don't work very well.Exhale smoke while wearing a mask,any mask and you will see the leakage.

I wore a mask to see if I've ever been in a situation where I haven't smoked or felt any pain before I have smoked."", ""...I used a mask to break a tree but"
85,15,"In a nutshell, he said in his book, ""[i) Wearing a mask to break a tree"" that it would be a great way to read that he's not a fan of his work or his life. If that's a valid reason for him to get a mask, he has to be told he is a ""devil wearer"" and will probably be able to read it."
85,18,I am actually very familiar with this.
85,24,And yet you don't even have to read it. You can't just read in a book. This guy sounds like a jerk.
85,30,"The Devil Wears a Mask, which is a documentary, is one of the best I've ever heard about the author/director of that book, and I recommend it."
85,32,This guy sounds so silly as to have to think about it.
85,34,"There's a movie titled, The Devil Wears a Mask, that teaches you about how to read the Bible and the Law and how to read it, and how to use it. I believe it's called The Law of Fire and the Law and a movie based on it."
85,35,"It would be a good idea for a film. You can see this film on YouTube on the TV. I've seen a few of Tim Curry's movies, some that he wrote about a bit of ""The Devil Wears a Mask"" and they are pretty well documented."
85,38,I think the second part of the book is very well done and has a lot of good points about the CDC and how a mask works. I think it's worth a read.
85,75,"""... and now I just don't understand how they can have a person that can't read a book or use their computer properly?"
85,77,"I mean, this is a lot of stuff."
85,2,"A good example of how people can read their own personal life, and then make money off of it."
85,5,"It's the CDC and a film. It's a book. The movie & book are pretty good, if he's looking for a new place to live."
85,11,"This is a great question, I don't want to be a judge of the movie."
85,12,So he needs a mask to read the Bible and the law.
85,15,"It's in the movie ""The Law of Fire and the Law"". It's one of the best things I've ever heard about the author/director of the book. I love ttave but I think he is a jerk."
85,18,This is a good one. I hope they'll be doing a movie about this and I really like Tim Curry.
85,24,"The Devil Wears a Mask, which is a documentary on the Internet about how people can read their own personal life."
85,30,"The movie The Devil Wears a Mask was written by Chris Evans, who had a few of his own works on. It is a great movie."
85,32,I think this guy sounds like a jerk. It's definitely one of the best books I've ever read and I recommend it.
85,34,This is a great idea for a film.
85,35,"I think this is what's wrong with the author. It makes sense to give him credit for how well he writes about how to read a book and how to use a mask. But in that respect, I don't think it's possible he should get a mask and read it."
85,38,"This is a lot of stuff. But if you ever want to read a book that you can read in the comfort of your own home and not have to read it, it's definitely worth a read."
85,75,"Apparently this has been covered in a book titled, The Devil Wears a Mask, which is an excellent documentary."
85,77,"OP, you're making a really good point there."
85,2,"... and now I just don't understand how they can have a person that can't read a book or use their computer properly? I mean, this is a lot of stuff. A good example of how people can read their own personal life, and then make money off of it. It's the CDC and a movie."
85,5,"It's interesting that you've all said the book is a good example of how people can read their own personal life, and then make money off of it."
85,11,"That is a good point, and I'm not sure if you would be able to tell me why."
85,12,"It's a movie, a book, and a movie. Apparently it's based on a book, about a man who was beaten by a man with a mask. This is a great story, a really good book, and one that's a very good film."
85,15,"I read this as The Devil Wears a Mask and have been incredibly surprised by how far he has come, in my opinion."
85,18,"I am curious about Tim Curry's book: ""The Devil Wears a Mask, that teaches you about how to read the Bible and the Law and how to use it. I believe it's called The Law of Fire and the Law and a movie based on it. It would be a good idea for a film."""
85,24,I read this in high school in the late 90s. I read it in high school and it really made me look forward to learning more about life. The book is my favorite and I recommend it as well.
85,30,"I'm very much interested in the movie, but I do not see it being considered good. I think I may recommend it."
85,32,I love the book. I just can't get it in print.
85,34,I'm sure he has a good idea for a film.
85,35,"It's an interesting thing, because they're pretty much the same person."
85,38,The only way you can read a book is with the help of a trusted person. You can't help but find the book by yourself if you don't like it.
85,75,Is this the first book of a film or are these the only books he wrote that are actually the only ones that actually get a mention in the movie?
85,77,"I'm sorry that I'm doing that, but in this context I do understand that his argument might be more accurate in its entirety."
85,2,It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
85,5,"They just don't have the money. The movie could be good. OP is a fan of the book, and his book makes the movie great."
85,11,"I don't think people are being sarcastic about this, or that they're being sarcastic."
85,12,> I think this guy sounds like a jerk. It's definitely one of the best books I've ever read and I recommend it. This is a great idea for a film.
85,15,"I read a book about people getting stung by the smoke while wearing a mask and they never learned to read it. They never got stung, but they did it in public. They even had a tv show. It was pretty good. I don't know why they would have to make a movie about that."
85,18,The Devil Wears a Mask is a great book - and the best one in the whole world. I'm not sure if you can get a movie in print.
85,24,"I don't understand your point at all. I'd like to read the book by myself if I could, but I'm in awe that it was written by a man who could only read the Bible and the Law and the Law. It's one of many books I've read that people can read and still read the Bible, or just read them."
85,30,It's also part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
85,32,"I would read his book in a book, though. The first chapter was about a guy who was beaten with a mask and used a cigarette lighter."
85,34,"Those things don't really sound bad, and people aren't being very good at it. The fact that the book is based on a book, and a movie based on it is a testament to how ineffective the CDC's policies were about how to reduce the number of people who need to be in hospital and what was done to prevent that sort of abuse is a sign that things are better than they were then. The book is a fantastic example of how people can read the Bible, and the law and the law should be a great idea for a film."
85,35,I sincerely hope this happens.
85,38,"I don't know the author, but I did read a few of his books."
85,75,"I'm not gonna lie. This guy is a jerk. You can't read any book he wrote that is not a good example of how people can read their own personal life, and then make money off of it."
85,77,"I read a book with Tim Curry about his experiences, so I'm not really sure if I know what it was."
85,2,"I read a book based on a book and found it extremely helpful, though I have to admit that this whole thing makes me sad."
85,5,Honestly I'd love to see a movie about this. I think it would be great to see the author in a movie. I just don't think people are being sarcastic about this.
85,11,"It would be great if he wrote a book about what the CDC and CDC are trying to do to stop people from getting stung. If he can't make the movie, he's probably doing the right thing."
85,12,"The people who are not going to get their books in print are the ones who are going to get it in print, not the people who can sell them on the internet."
85,15,He has done it. It isn't about what he does. It's about how his cologne was good. It's not about the cost. He wrote the book.
85,18,"I don't know if anyone's gonna read any of his books, but I do know that in a lot of cases, a guy who tries to get his name spelled out in a book is just a jerk."
85,24,It's a movie based on the book he wrote.
85,30,"This is really a good book for a film, but I think it needs some time. I think some people need to read this as a series. I don't really care if you know what the guy is talking about. But maybe this one is a good one."
85,32,"I’m going to give a review of this book to people who don’t have a book to read. It has a lot of interesting facts. The whole thing reminds me of when I read the book in my head, and a lot of times I think people are trying to read the whole thing."
85,34,"> ""The first chapter is about a guy who was beaten with a mask and used a cigarette lighter."
85,35,The people who do it don't need any kind of masks for the purpose of taking the movie or promoting the movie.
85,38,I don't know the author but I do know that a lot of sarcasm is implied because it is the first book I read. I know that the movie would be based on his books.
85,75,I want to talk about my favorite book if you'd like to read the movie if you're interested.
85,77,">""I read a book with Tim Curry about his experiences, so I'm not really sure if I know what it was."""
85,2,"If you read the book, you'll see that it's about a guy who was beaten with a mask, and then you'll see that he's an asshole. I just don't see how you'd be able to tell anyone who reads this book if you haven't read it. I'd be pretty scared for the people who might be in there."
85,5,I read his book based on a book.
85,11,"It's an excellent example of how people can read their own personal life, and then make money off of it."
85,12,"I've never had a time when a book was made about someone, but I'm glad to say that this book is what you recommend."

85,35,I read his book based on a book. He's on the front page of a major media outlet.

85,75,"A good example is to buy a book of his, based on his own book, then re-read the book and put it in the ""movie"" that came out."
85,77,I read a book about this. I think it’s funny how he’s been in many of these situations.
85,2,So I've never heard of the book. I've only heard of it on the internet.
85,5,"It sounds like the author is probably just an idiot who needs a mask for personal stuff, and has a tendency to say the same thing, but it seems like he was trying to get out of the situation, and he just didn't make it into a movie."

85,12,"""A good example is to buy a book based on his own book, then re-read the book and put it in the ""movie"" that came out."
85,15,"He's basically a writer, not a movie star."
85,18,It's funny because you don't know what he's talking about. It's actually quite the opposite of what people think. But it still sounds like an excellent book.
85,24,I don't know where to start but I think it's going to make a really good movie.
85,30,"I think you’ve had a good read on it, as you’ll read them more."
85,32,"It is interesting to note that these comments don't have any actual context, because I've primarily been reading them in context.

85,2,This is not a sarcastic article. You are not arguing with the author and your comment is not going to get any of their credibility. The CDC and the media need to be a little bit more clear as to what is said.
85,5,"I think it's really hilarious, but if he spits his own shit, it probably sucks, but if he just wants to make money, he should make the movie."
85,11,"It's been a while since I've actually seen the movie, so I think that's what's interesting. I do think it would be great to have a movie with that attitude, which is a little odd. The guy is trying to scare people away with this. He is a good guy, but I do think that people are trying to make this film as a movie."
85,12,I think this is a good idea. The author is going to make a movie about him.
85,15,"It's not funny, it's really sad, and it's a good book."
85,18,"Well I was reading this book and the movie was funny to read. I was also reading this book because I had a cigarette lighter and a cigarette lighter in my pocket, and was scared because I didn't wear my mask. The movie was also fun and I've seen a few others and they sound pretty interesting."
85,24,"I’ve read a book about people who cannot read a book without a mask, and I have to say that’s just not the type of book I want to read. I was the type of person that would just eat something while I was reading, and I didn’t want to know what to say next."
85,30,I think you’ve got to be more careful with your comments than I am.
85,32,I've never read a book in a week so I can't answer anything. I've read this a handful of times in my life and all of my friends had been in this situation with me.
85,34,I read that quote with great sadness in my head:
85,35,I don't even believe the book and the movie are about that stuff.
85,38,"i read this in a journal, I got all this information and am so glad i have not read this before i'm back to work"
85,75,"The movie is about the ""devil wears a mask"" and it's an excellent film."
85,77,I read this a few months ago. It's so bad that I don't want to read anymore. I haven't even read it yet.
85,2,I'd rather a movie than a book because of how I read a book
85,5,"I've read a book called ""Weeds to Break a Tree"" (a book about a guy who can't read a book without a mask)."
85,11,My first thought was to not read a book about people who couldn't read their own personal life. I had an inkling he wanted to make a movie about it.
85,12,"he is a jerk. he has to buy and read a book based on his own book, then do the same with a cig lighter. that's a bit different."
85,15,"I just have to say this: ""(a lot of people) think wearing a mask is a great idea."
85,18,"Those books are fucking fantastic. They're an amazing book, but they're a horrible fucking movie."
85,24,"I think it's probably because the movie was not intended to be about the government, and he is trying to make money out of it. But he's being honest with the media. I don't have to go into that, but it's funny to say that he's trying to get the government to do something about the government, so the movie may actually be based on his book."
85,30,That shit is so ridiculous. I don't think it is. I just don't think the guy can tell you what he's talking about - he doesn't want to make money with a film.
85,32,"""People are not fools, they're people that are just assholes based on information they have to offer."""
85,34,I've read some books and I'm just so confused about it
85,35,"The CDC, the government, and the media can't tell you how much of a savage it is, but it doesn't have to. This is about how the government treats people. The people who do it don't know what they're doing. They just have to get over it and be happy for it."
85,38,I'm not sarcastic. This is the sort of thing that is just ridiculous if it's an overreaction that a lot of people aren't comfortable with. It's about how the government treats people in a different way than others.
85,75,It is not a movie.
85,77,I'm trying to be naive here. So let's give you a few words from the author. He has a book about people who can read with a mask and they cannot be scared of anything because they cannot read without a mask.

85,15,You read the book and it was a great book.
85,18,The book about the government is about how people who can't read a book without a mask have an extremely negative effect on the world. Obviously it is not a big deal.
85,24,The book is the best movie I've seen so far.
85,30,"That's the way to go, I'm sure he's still trying to find an affordable way to prevent a viral infection. I would love to see a movie about him with a mask."

85,2,"I don't think you understand the point, but it sounds to me like it was written by a person in Australia."
85,5,"So, what exactly happened? It's not a very good book. There are some great movies about people who can't read without a mask. But, they just cannot afford to get a mask, they can only afford to spend one hour a day to help someone who can read while wearing a mask."
85,11,Is this what the movie is about?
85,12,I have never read a book with a mask and I am sorry. Despite my being a fan of the movie and what I can say I don't think I've ever heard of this. It's probably just a bunch of misinformation about the situation that I have to deal with.
85,15,"I'm sure that a lot of people do think that wearing a mask is a good idea. It's a great book about the government but it's not a movie. I think it's just a great idea, but it's not as good as a movie. """
85,18,Why are these movies based on books about people with different dietary preferences or disabilities?
85,24,"The problem is that he's trying to make a movie about the government, and the government needs to tell him to just stop the movie."
85,30,"That is a very good argument. I think he needs to reevaluate his career and career as a physician. His personal philosophy is to put him in the position to improve himself and to be successful in helping others. The problem is that he needs to know better and take steps to improve himself, and he doesn't have time to make that a big deal. He doesn't need to eat well unless it happens."

It’s about the fact that he’s trying to make a movie about the government but he’s doing it to make money off of it. It’s a terrible idea, and he’s trying to make money off of it.”"

85,12,"I don't think there's anything wrong with it, because the book is basically a book about how you can help a man who is suffering from the disease. If you don't think it's important to you, then the book can be made to look good in person. It's a really good book but it's about how you can have the person's life made to look better."
85,15,This is very well written. The author is trying to get the government to stop the spread of the virus.

85,35,The author of the book's book isn't inventing anything. He was. It's about how the government treats people and that he has a good idea of how to treat people.
85,38,"You're the one who got sarcasm. If it weren't for his book about the guy, that's why he's such an asshole."
85,75,I'm glad you've read this. I read it and I'm so glad you're right!
85,77,It isn't about the film of him as the movie was written about.
85,2,I don't think he has any authority over this stuff. This is a fucking euphemism for a restraining order. It's in fact the same as an euphemism for the same reason: The only thing I've read is a gimmick that doesn't work very well.
85,5,>I read the book based on the story about a guy who was raped with a cigarette lighter
85,11,"No sarcasm. OP doesn't want to be a judge, he's just not interested. You should read his book, it's a good example of how people can read their own personal life, and then make money off of it."
85,12,So what you're saying is that a book about the CDC based on a book about him is not a movie if it's a documentary based on the book that was made.
85,15,I'm sure the author is being extremely condescending.
85,18,That's the point! People need to make more hats.
85,24,It is an absolutely fantastic book.
85,30,"This is about a guy who is being sarcastic and irrational, so you are right - you just aren't a good guy. And you can't just read the book because it's about a guy who was raped with a cigarette lighter. You can't just buy a cigarette lighter."
85,32,He said in his book that he would do it with a cigarette lighter. He is not really a big fan of the government. So the movie is his.
85,34,The book is about a guy who was raped with a cigarette lighter. It was a book about a guy who was raped with a cigarette lighter.
85,35,"OP, you're being totally misconstrued here. I think you're being incredibly insensitive. I feel like a lot of people with this kind of understanding, and some who have read and listened to it can't do it. I don't like the movie because it's not a ""fun"" movie."
85,38,I like the title. It's about how the government treats people. But not the story of him.
85,75,"i read the book and it was a good read. It's based on a story about a man who was raped with a cigarette lighter, but he was hit by a cig lighter."
85,77,What exactly does the book tell us about his story?
85,2,"I'm not saying that the article is misleading, but I'm just saying that the title of the book makes more sense to a person who would not read a book."
85,5,So you don't want me to talk about this and this movie?
85,11,"I'm really not sure why this guy doesn't want to be in the movie. Maybe people are trying to make him laugh at the idea that he will only make one movie based on the idea of him being raped with a cigarette lighter. I mean, he is a good guy. But he didn't even get a restraining order."
85,12,">""I think OP's book is very interesting. It isn't about how the government treats people,"
85,15,"You are wrong. The guy is a jerk. The he who writes the book isn't a movie star, but the author is."
85,18,"I think that if you want to censor it and let people know the facts, you should read the book. It is about how the government treats people and how they treat people."
85,24,"oh god, the book makes you look like shit."
85,30,The author is trying to make the movie about the guy. The author is trying to get the government to subsidize him.
85,32,Why wouldn't you read the book because you didn't think the book was about him? Why aren't you?
85,34,This is the first time I have thought of a movie about a rapist with a cigarette lighter. It's actually about a guy who was raped with a cigarette lighter.
85,35,CANNOTANSWER ON THE ACT NOW! 'Weeds to Break a Tree'
85,38,The CDC is trying to make a movie. It’s not based on his book. He’s trying to make a movie. It’s based on his book. His book is a good one. He's trying to make a movie.
85,75,They're just saying the movie was a mishmash. This guy's a jerk. You can't read it.
85,77,The book about him is very good for a movie. The book is based on his experiences. Whether or not it is really about the CDC is hard to say.
85,2,"I think the article is insensitive because the author, a big fan of the CDC, is trying to get a restraining order. Not sure if he would have the same authority or not."
85,5,The CDC and its movie team are attempting to stop the spread of a virus.
85,11,It was a good read. He made a good movie. It doesn't work. He makes a good film about a rapist who was raped with a cigarette lighter.
85,12,"I'm not sure what you're saying about the book but it sounds like a good idea, but I think it's a good idea and can help someone who is suffering from a rat shit disorder. I feel a little depressed because I haven't read that book and I know how to get that kind of help a lot of people who are going to get raped by a cigarette lighter to rape some guy."
85,15,"Is there a good reason for you to avoid reading this? The author of the book will probably tell you if you read the book, but not necessarily the book."
85,18,"I just came off as a jaded, sarcastic spouting fan of the title he's putting out."
85,24,Why did this movie make the front page? What's the most popular movie on the Internet?
85,30,"- ""I read the book, I know that the thing is that they are not cheap and I don't understand why they can't buy it, but I'm pretty sure it's cheap enough."""
85,32,It's a great film. I think it was good at telling the story. I think it was great at telling the story of the guy who was raped with a cigarette lighter.
85,34,"And when it comes down to it, why is it so insecure?"
85,35,I have read a few of his books. One of them is a great book. The other one is about a guy who could read without a cigarette lighter.
85,38,"I'm an avid reader. It's kind of funny how you say that, but it feels like you have a more sensible and respectful view of it."
85,75,I'm going to take a break from you and say a word about it. I read a book based on a story. It was a good read.
85,77,The author can't make a movie about a guy who was raped with a cigarette lighter. He can make a movie about a guy who was raped with a cigarette lighter.
85,2,"It sounds like that is the only way to make a restraining order. You sound like a pretty smart man, a scumbag, a scumbag, a dick, a dick, and a scumbag."
85,5,The book has been around a long time and has been seen as a good read by many. I don't know that much about the story and I don't think that people are reading it in the same vein or just as well. It's just about the idea. There's so much more to the story that the author doesn't seem to understand. I know that he is trying to make a movie because he knows he's not the one who made the movie. I think this is going to get a movie.
85,11,...s he didn't get a restraining order?...and he had a restraining order?
85,12,"I can say with certainty that it is in the works but we'll continue to call it ""The book""."
85,15,"I don't think the author, and his movie, are very interesting or interesting in comparison to the book. It isn't really that bad, and I don't think it is as good as a movie or a movie. I feel like the author is trying to get a restraining order."
85,18,oh this sounds like a great movie
85,24,a. book about the CDC
85,30,"""There's just too much sarcasm to come here."
85,32,I would read the book as well.
85,34,The first part is a bit too much.
85,35,What do you think is the problem with this idea? Does it make sense that he's just using a mask because he was the one who invented it?
85,38,It's one of the worst movies ever made.
85,75,"I don't know if I read it wrong, but it's kinda funny because I actually had a good laugh about it. I think the author of this is probably right, and it's interesting that he's trying to get a restraining order on the CDC."
85,77,CANNOTANSWER ON THE ACT NOW! is not intended to be a commentary.
85,2,So the book is a fucking book about the CDC and their new policy on drugs.
85,5,I read this book. This is so funny.
85,11,This is a good example of why it's not a great idea. It is about a guy who has a cigarette lighter in his hand. I think it's funny but not sarcastic.
85,12,"So, a book based on the Book?"
85,15,"I think this is just a sarcastic quote from Bill Nye. He's a writer, not a movie star. He wrote a book about the government. He wasn't the author of the book. His idea of a movie was a great one, but it's not really the best idea."
85,18,"I don't think I'm that person, though."
85,24,"My point is that this movie is based on a book. It was a good book but a cliche about the government. It is a good movie, and it isn't a cliche about the government. It isn't the greatest thing about the internet."
85,30,he's trying to get a restraining order on the CDC
85,32,"The word'shame' seems to be a combination of the two, meaning that they are two different words implying a different outcome compared to the real thing, while also saying that 'the Devil's Wearing a Mask' is a lie about the actual victim's mind. The book is a good example of this and that there are not any specific problems for anyone with such a view. The book is a great example of what the author was trying to sell the film to people who don't want to."
85,34,The second part is too much.
85,35,"The book he wrote about the Devil Wears a Tree and his book is not ""a movie"", but is a documentary on the government and its uses."
85,38,I think it's pretty good.
85,75,This is why most people want a restraining order against the CDC.
85,77,"The thing is, the whole ""We know some people who love to read with their masks, but sometimes people aren't as good of a reader as a man who can read without a cigarette lighter."" sarcasm is just too much."
85,2,"He can't be a doctor, he needs to find a way to do it properly."
85,5,A lot of these examples don't even make sense - these are the ones I'm not sure about.
85,11,">The book is a good example of how people can read their own personal life, and then make money off of it."
85,12,"This book was made out of some sort of material from a book of a book. It's not about a guy who got raped by a cigarette lighter, but about a guy who blew up with a cigarette lighter."
85,15,"I don't know why they have to make a movie about it, but the movie itself is good. I don't know why the author is trying to get a restraining order against the CDC."
85,18,"This isn't about a movie. This is about how people can be made feel like they're the best of the best and most able-bodied, but don't think of themselves as the worst."
85,24,"It's also a book he wrote. It's a good example of the type of book that's just a ""good book"" but doesn't really make sense."
85,30,You have to be at least a little more patient than you have with the movie and what's going on with that movie.
85,32,The author is trying to get a restraining order against the CDC.
85,34,"Despite a number of things, ""The Devil Wears a Tree"" sounds like the movie. It's an unpopular opinion. You can't read the book without a mask."
85,35,"This sounds like a good book. It's got some good premise, but it has also got some bad themes (I like to think that the author has a lot of people trying to get him to change things, but not the people who have the best idea). But I don't think he's inventing anything."
85,38,"In the movie, I think I’ll read the book. I’m gonna read the movie."
85,75,I love reading about the CDC. I can't even imagine how the author could be so mad about that book.
85,77,"I read the book, then came up with the last sentence. It seems like it’s about the fact that he’s trying to make a movie about the government, not the book itself. The movie is based on his experiences and I’m not sure what its based off of. I do understand the people who think it’s funny, but in this context I’m not sure what the other comments are supposed to be about."
85,2,You sound pretty stupid and ignorant. You’re trying to be rude and mean.
85,5,">In the movie, I think I’ll read the book. I’m gonna read the movie."
85,11,"The movie is a pretty good example of how people can read their own personal life, and then make money off of it."
85,12,CANNOTANSWER ON THE ACT NOW!
85,15,A very interesting fact is that most of these examples aren't really about the movie.
85,18,"The author is trying to get a restraining order against the CDC, but he has already made the film about the book, and so hasn't started making any films, though."
85,24,My first thought was to get a restraining order.
85,30,"I don't see it in the book. It sounds like the movie. I read it, and it's pretty good. It's about a guy who was raped with a cigarette lighter, a guy who blew up with a cigarette lighter, and a guy who's got some AIDS. The author is trying to get a restraining order against the CDC. The book is a good example of how the government treats a person in a different way than others."
85,32,"I read this before, and this is the most confusing question I have ever heard."
85,34,"There is not one thing the CDC would do for a movie about it. If there was, there would be no film."
85,35,"This is a good example of how people can get rid of a stigma and be a good doctor for a better life, and how he wants the government to treat them as better people. He’s not shady at all, he has a very naive and well-written perspective and doesn’t understand how it works. He’s a good therapist and his book is a great example of how the government treats people in a different way. I don’t know the exact definition of the word to describe how people treat people."
85,38,I am so happy that you are having an honest discussion about this book.
85,75,The movie cites “The Devil Wears a Mask” as the title. The book is a fictionalized version of the book.

85,11,The movie is about a man who has been raped with a cigarette lighter. He's a good guy. But it's not going to be a movie.
85,12,"OP referred to the movie as the ""Picture of the Devil."""
85,15,I read a book about being able to read the first sentence of the story if I'm not mistaken.
85,18,"""... But I don't want to be a judge of the movie."""
85,24,The book about the CDC is a good example of how the government treats people in a different way than others. The movie is about how the government treats the people in a different way.
85,30,"> ""How to prevent a virus"""
85,32,"If you don't read the book, you should probably be reading the book (not the movie), not the movie. It's a very good example of how the government treats people in a different way than others."
85,34,"What about the book ""The Devil Wears a Tree"" (a cig lighter / film/scigar smoker's story)?"
85,35,"This makes no sense, and the book is based off of the book, not the book."
85,38,Read the book and listened to what the people who've heard you are saying - it's a wonderful way to put people in the mood to be a good listener.
85,75,"I like the quote ""I am so happy that you are having an honest discussion about this book."" I think the author is a genius."
85,77,What do you mean by this?
85,2,That's not the issue you're referring to. This is about how people treat the government in a different way than others.
85,5,The first and second paragraphs aren't the only ones where the word is used to describe it. The first and second paragraphs are actually the ones that were used to describe what is going on in a given day and timeframe.
85,11,[I am](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit-relationships/r/reddit-relationships/r/r-relationships-the-diverse-and-disabled-relationships/)
85,12,I'm going to read a bunch of docs (every single one was the same but different) that talk about raping the person who blew up. Eventually I'll just look at the rest of the stories.
85,15,You’re going to be right.
85,18,"When you have a book, a movie or movie based on it is the cheapest way to get a book made."
85,24,"No, I don't. I want to find an honest movie, the best one to read, and a movie to tell a story about the government."
85,30,"""I read the book, I know that the thing is that they are not cheap and I don't understand why they can't buy it, but I'm pretty sure it's cheap enough."""
85,32,"I was reading a book in high school and it did sound like a lot of fun. I had an extremely strong memory of the moment I was raped and the first time I reapplied a cigarette lighter and I started to want to stop reading it. It was a lot of fun, but it's not a great book. It was a great example of how the government treats people in a different way than others. I could easily get in trouble for it. I had to be in a different one in the back and I'd get a job."
85,34,"It's not a great example of how the government treats people, but it's a great example of how people can get rid of a stigma and be a good doctor for a better life. He's not a shady at all, he has a very naive and well-written perspective and doesn't understand how it works."
85,35,"They have to get over the shit, not their masks."
85,38,The movie is based off of the book and not the movie.
85,75,"That movie is about a person who has a disability. You see, the title is misleading, but the book focuses more on the person with the disability he reads the book about. So for the most part, it's a mish-mash."
85,77,"The book cites people who are raped and they can't read the book, if they are not, the cigs are not really as good as the book, as it is written, and they are not as good as the book - they aren't really being seen as the movie - they are being shown as a movie by the CDC."
85,2,"You sound kind of like a weird, sexist, scumbag. I was just listening to this. But I thought I would rephrased my first sentence."
85,5,"It’s one of the greatest ideas ever written. Certainly something to try and get people to make a change or go into the new era. It’s kinda like getting the same ""everybody knows it's a good thing, a bad thing, and it’s a good thing."" That’s about it."
85,11,"I was reading a book about the CDC, and it was about a guy who was raped with a cigarette. It was good but he blew up, and was too young for me to read the book."
85,12,">I'm gonna buy a book based on the book, then re-read the book and put it in the ""movie"" that came out."
85,15,And then they're talking about all the different approaches the government employs to scare people.
85,18,It's not a bad idea to be a sarcastic person. People are people who have different kinds of beliefs and beliefs. But that's a different story.
85,24,There's no difference between a book written by a man who can't read a book without a mask and a book based on a book about the CDC.
85,30,"So how do you start? I think that the ""Memoirs of a man who couldn't read a book"" is really good. The ""How to prevent a virus"" and the ""How to stop a virus from spreading"" are good examples of why the CDC needs to do something about it."
85,32,I believe you have already reread a lot of things.
85,34,"CANNOTANSWER: This guy, who was raped with a cigarette lighter, was raped with a cigarette lighter, and a cig lighter. He is a man and he is a man and he is a man and he is a man and is the most powerful person on earth."
85,35,"A lot of people arguing this is why I don't believe in the ""Serious Men"", but I just don't think the whole point is, ""How is it a good example of how the government treats people, but the government does nothing about it"". I don't think ""Must read a book without a cigarette lighter."" I think ""If you can read it and it's based off of the book"" is misleading, but the book is based on the book. What about the movie"""
85,38,"""The book isn't about the government."""
85,75,I think it’s pretty damn funny.
85,77,"""The book is based on the book, not the movie. It's about the fact that he's trying to make a movie about the government"
85,2,It sounds like the author has to read it. He’s making the assumption that he can’t read because the person is a dick.
85,5,he’s not an idiot and I can’t do a better job.
85,11,So he’s trying to make a movie about how the government is trying to prevent the spread of the virus?
85,12,"""It's interesting because you don't know what he’s talking about."""
85,15,"It isn’t a great idea, but it is good."
85,18,"I'm going to have to say that I'm not that happy with this movie. I know I'm not gonna be in trouble for this, but it's my opinion that the movie is based on a book about a guy who is raped, but I feel the film will give people a real feel for the person who was raped, and then they realize they're not on any kind of social social stage or that the movie is just a cult for the sake of the story."
85,24,I believe it is a good book because it is about the government and not about the virus.
85,30,He has been raped with a cigarette lighter (which was not the one he wrote); his cigarette was the one that caught him. And it's about how the government is trying to control how he handles the CDC.
85,32,"I have not heard Tim Curry quote the first sentence correctly. The CDC has been trying to censor this material into a film that has been made about it. If there isn't any context, he's a liar."
85,34,It’s the same person who did the crime - a rapist. I’m sure the CDC can tell the story of the story and the fact that he’s the one to get his way on a bad note.
85,35,">I think I'm right, but I think your point isn't that they don't use masks for any kind of personal stuff. Especially when they're pretty much the same person.'"
85,38,A lot of people say that the CDC wants to make a movie about people who are raped and not people who have been raped before and a movie about the government. Then they tell the people who can read about the CDC that the movie is about them who should be making that movie or to the government.
85,75,"""... And now I just don't understand how they can have a person that can't read a book or use their computer properly?"""
85,77,"""I think it's pretty damn funny."
85,2,I have some other ideas to add but I'm thinking about something else.
85,5,I would say that because of this book. You are being sarcastic. I would also say that I am unable to read that book. I would like to see a movie about the Devil Wears a Mask.
85,11,"The movie is not about the CDC or other government agencies. I think people are just saying it's ridiculous and if you're reading the book, then yes, it is a good example of how people can read their personal lives."
85,12,Why not add in the movie and tell the story of a guy who was raped and you're gonna look at the movie.
85,15,"""I just have to say this: I love the idea of people getting their heads in the right place and getting a book,"" ""I read the book and it was a great read."
85,18,"This sarcastic question is a big one. You don't know the exact context, but it 'is'a lot about the government. That's the point. The book is about the government. If you read the book based on the book, you know what they're comparing the movie to. The movie is about a government. It's about how the government treats people. It's not about people who are raped or not. The book is a movie. The book is about how the government treats people."
85,24,I can't speak for any of these people. I have to say that I don't feel it's fair to tell someone that their friend was the victim of the CDC - and it's true that they are probably wrong.
85,30,That is a lot of sarcasm.
85,32,"This guy, this is a real story of how this is a good example of how the government treats people."
85,34,CANNOTANSWER:
85,35,"This is why I haven’t read The Devil Wears a Tree in years. Its pretty funny. It’s scary and a little bit dreadful but hey, the Devil Wears a Tree is pretty funny. The Devil Wears a Tree is a great book because of the people who are the characters. I’m not sure what he is referring to, but it’s a great book."
85,38,"I had a friend who was in a hospital with a degenerative disease. He said he went to the CDC because he knew something was wrong. I didn't even see it, so I got to go and get a book. He recalled reading it. But he thought it was a bit too long, and decided to go on to another one. I felt like I was in a position to read it for himself, but I couldn't remember how many times I read his books (all the things I have said I don't really know him) when I was"
85,75,"I read a book with the 'devil' and the movie I read is about the CDC, but I read it without the cig. But, I read the book without the cig. So he has to have a cig, and it's a cig."
