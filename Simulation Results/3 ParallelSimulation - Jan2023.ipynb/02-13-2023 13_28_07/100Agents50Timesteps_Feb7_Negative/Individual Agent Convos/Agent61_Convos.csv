61,14,"We also have a system of ad hoc vaccination screenings, a test for sclerozyme antibodies and a simple testing for bronchitis - a vaccination....

61,32,i just learned this yesterday in ny and i will be wearing a mask at twitchcon
61,35,"I hope they get a bunch of people to join the TWitchcon meme and put on a mask, the masks are a bit risqué "
61,37,"In order to stop a virus from spreading in Maryland, you must wear a mask. A mask is a piece of evidence that an individual with boosters is a 'vaccinated' person, if it will be possible. You need to wear a mask to stop this, you must be going to an event or event."
61,39,"I like how you are being used as an example. It takes a lot of thinking and effort and a lot of courage to put a mask on for an event. It gets you into a nutshell, but you still do not seem to be getting sick. I was just trying to chime in but I can t help but wonder how we should be able to wear masks after you say something sexist to a reporter."
61,40,"This is the truth. My aunt was diagnosed with a Virus. I went to the TWitch Con and got my first vaccinated. We went to the events at my grandmother's house. I just couldn't get in or out of bed. I couldn't even see them because they were so loud. I wanted to be safe. My sister got vaccinated and gave me a worm vaccine so she didn't get sick. I got the worm and I lost it, got sick and lost a worm. I just got my first vaccinated"
61,44,So what happened when I lost a mask at Twitchcon?
61,45,I’m going to go to Washington state this weekend :D
61,47,I'm going to tell you this: The US has mandates on who must wear a mask if they are vaccinated / vaccinated.
61,49,I can't believe that 'twitchcon' is in sd
61,50,I'm a vaccinated person with boosters and i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask.
61,59,I sat at twitchcon and just had a great time and a very good time.
68,61,I don't understand your point
84,61,I'm not sure how often they would just use a mask. I'd say you need to shave it a lot to get to the point where it doesn't work for everyone. I would just stop putting your eyes in it and go fuck off.
101,61,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
61,9,The idea of being able to wear a mask is pretty much ridiculous in Maryland.
61,13,"I have been vaccinated by a reputable organization, vaccinating my daughter, and she had two years of vaccine therapy. And a few years ago, I lost my vaccination, and I had to put on a mask. A guy on a train left me and was scared for my life. Then I asked him to cut his head off and tell him ""NEVER ever get sick again!"". He told me it was because he couldn't get sick and he tried to scream ninja ninja ninja."

61,35,"I'm a Vaccinated person, and the only reason I wear a mask is because I'm afraid it would give me any serious neurological symptoms like swine flu or anything else."
61,37,"I've never actually been to the event at Twitchcon, but I can confirm - once they do do it - that they'll be making a blanket statement saying the same thing."
61,39,"I was trying to be honest but the problem is that it was only a twitchcon meme. I did not know it was a meme, so I guess you have some experience on this sub?"
61,40,They need to go to a party to stop the spread of the virus.
61,44,"I'm actually from Virginia. I am in Washington State. I was actually vaccinated at Twitchcon, and had to wear a mask for a very limited time."
61,45,I'm going to tell you this: The US has mandates on who must wear a mask if they are vaccinated / vaccinated.

61,59,"I have a mask that I wear and I'm a shaver. You have a facial hair. It does work for me. I'm a shaver, but I've never seen a person wearing a facial hair mask."
68,61,"I’m a doctor, I don’t know that people in the US are supposed to be vaccinated, and I don’t think that ‘doing it for me’ is the correct way of saying it. I thought the guy in the twitch con with boosters was a bad person, and not a twitch doctor. I’m not sure if he wants to go back."

61,47,[NAME] on the other hand was in my family a shaver and got vaccinated with the virus.
61,49,The thing with TWitchCon is that they're actually doing it for the benefit of all people.
61,50,"The only one I can think of being naive for doing it was at the twitchcon meme, which is why I'm from Maryland."
61,59,There's a reason we don't get any other vaccines. We don't know how often people are going to wear masks.
68,61,TWitchcon and the new ACA are all about how to keep people safe from getting sick and infect others.
84,61,If I had my eyes in my mouth every day a lot of the time I would just cut my nose. I'm not sure how to tell. I want to make sure I'm not being in a position to use the mask.

61,35,"Is the guy at TWitchcon wearing a mask a liar? If not, the whole ol' thing looks like it's about people who haven't been vaccinated, and don't want to do that, the guy who told the story just didn't know he was going to do it."

61,39,That was the joke! The issue is that people are stupid. Not if the sexes themselves are not vaccinated.
61,40,"I like the idea of a guy that has a nose cut and is an expert in how to prevent people from getting sick and being snooped on. And I think this is a fucking cliche. I have never seen a guy wearing a mask, but I do think it's a pathetic excuse to try and keep the government from using it."

They didn't put it on because they wouldn't stop her from getting AIDS at all and had to put a twitchcon on her. I'd never have seen her face or heard her face if she wore a mask. I was surprised by their attitude towards it and told them the truth, but they made it seem like they had a twitchcon."

61,22,I think the joke is that the person saying it is a joke that is a joke. The person who asked the question is actually very funny. They are blaming the government and the police. That is why they are trying to keep the people who get vaccinated from getting vaccines. The joke is made up. Vaccination is only a joke because it's a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke.
61,32,"Well that's how I think this is. It seems like this is all the jokes about the CDC that the word meme is used for. It's a joke that someone says ""I don't like the joke of the CDC""."

61,49,"The joke has nothing to do with politics, but about vaccines. And a lot of people are actually actually vaccinated, and there is no way that they can control the spread of any of the viruses."
61,50,Vaccination is not the answer. It is a joke because it is a joke. It's a joke because it is a joke because it's a joke. Vaccination is a joke. Vaccination is the best way to stop the spread of a virus.

61,49,There are many more things to think about. Vaccination is important. You can't stop the spread of a virus with a mask. This is what's happening with TWickCon.

61,14,"So, when the government goes into a joke that isn't a joke. There's a ""joke"" in the article."
61,22,The first paragraph of the article:
61,32,"Vaccination is a joke that is not a joke. It is a joke because it is a joke. The word joke is used to make jokes. The CDC is using it in an attempt to make a joke. They are trying to make a joke, but it is a joke."

61,45,The article implies that the US has mandates on who must wear a mask if they are vaccinated. It implies that the CDC is calling out the lack of health care laws for this reason.
61,47,Vaccination is important and it is a joke. It's not a joke because of the joke. There's no joke about it. Vaccination is a joke because it's what it is. It's a joke because of how it's the government.
61,49,I’m getting sick so the police and CDC won’t stop vaccinating me. The government’s job is to prevent the spread of a virus. But it’s in the public interest to prevent it from being in the public interest.
61,50,Vaccination is not the best way to stop the spread of a virus. People don't like wearing a mask. It's a very big part of how the government operates. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of a virus.
61,59,I think it would be better to just put a piece of shit into it.

61,39,Vaccination is important and the CDC is a joke.
61,40,It sounds like you are being incredibly harsh. They are trying to make you think that it is a joke.
61,44,"That's a good thing to think about. What's a good thing about doing that? It's important to get people to get vaccines and prevent the spread of a virus, because that would be something you have to learn to use to get it, rather than just a joke."

61,13,... And now I’m going to tell you that it makes sense. Wearing a mask is the best way to stop the spread of AIDS. Please wear a mask.
61,14,What makes a joke about the government?

61,50,"I'm sorry, but I was just trying to say that it's not a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke."
61,59,Because it's the joke and it's a joke. I feel like my point is that people are being so rude and ignorant about the'strange' vaccination thing that the joke just makes no sense to them.
68,61,>I'm not really a racist and I don't care. I hate it. The ACA isn't racist.

61,9,"In this case, I think a vaccinated person with boosters should wear a mask, but you need to be willing to go to an event. A CDC vaccination, for example, is a joke."
61,13,"You are absolutely right, TWickCon is a joke. It’s not a joke at all."
61,14,They just like to make it fun.
61,22,You're not a joke.
61,32,I don't know if the CDC's acronym is racist or not but I don't think that's entirely true of the jokes they make. It might be more of a joke than a joke about the CDC.
61,35,Vaccination is a joke because of the issue of people vaccinating themselves.
61,37,"""... the joke is absurd because it's a joke. A funny joke, but not a joke. The idea of wearing a mask is absurd."

61,49,I am pretty sure that the best way to stop the spread of the AIDS is not to make people sick or have one. I would be a little nervous at that stage.
61,50,Vaccination is the best way to stop the spread of the virus. People don't like wearing a mask. It's a very big part of how the government operates. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of a virus.
