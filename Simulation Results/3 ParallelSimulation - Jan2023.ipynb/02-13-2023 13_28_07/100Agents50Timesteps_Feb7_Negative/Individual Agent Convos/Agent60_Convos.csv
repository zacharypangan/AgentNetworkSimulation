71,60,"So that you don't like the smell, you're a really bad one, and you are a really bad one, and you know what's a shit load of shit?"
77,60,So the guy in the movie has never tried to tell the president about the virus?

60,23,No. The joke is a joke. It is a joke.
60,26,So why do we even have to wear a mask in order to stop this?
60,30,There are a lot of ridiculous things that people can be ashamed of when they learn that it is legal to wear a mask while under a helmet.
60,46,It's the most obvious one. Vaccination is a joke. You don't have to pay for it.

60,26,Then why does this sub?
60,30,...I have to go get my meds now.
60,46,"The problem here is the CDC isn't doing anything about the vaccine, the government. They are just trying to make a joke."
60,56,I’ve got a friend who said they were going to use a mask to prevent it spreading. They’re all going to eat a pizza smear and get an NSA-type infection. It's not even close to the best you can get from a mask.
66,60,"We don't want to do anything, but we don't want to do anything. We don't want the government to try to ban all vaccines, but the CDC, FA, and CDC are working on preventing the spread of a virus."
67,60,There are literally hundreds of examples of how the government works that are used for the purpose of preventing the spread of a virus.

60,46,A lot of the jokes are very silly. The first part is about the people who were sick. I believe it was a joke but the second half is about the CDC trying to get rid of vaccines and not the public health department trying to stop a virus.

60,23,Is it possible that the government actually was joking?
60,26,Why would the CDC want to ban the CDC from spreading vaccines?

60,46,Vaccines have become very controversial. It’s almost as if they have no basis in science or the way that the government would do things for them. It doesn’t matter what they do. That’s the point of the whole thing.

67,60,You are being insensitive because the CDC is allowing them to help others in the military to stop the spread of a virus.
71,60,I can't see why people are trying to cite the joke.

60,23,Vaccines are a horrible disease. Vaccines are a terrible disease. They can't go without getting vaccinated.
60,26,I think the joke is a joke because of the government and the government can't have them.
60,30,Vaccines are illegal and are only used for emergencies because they do not affect people with a condition.
60,46,I read this in the voice of John Stump.
60,56,So the NSA is trying to make the government a more trustworthy organization and I think this is about the administration?
66,60,Vaccination is a legitimate tool that keeps people safe. People do not understand how a CDC has used masks as a way to stop the spread of a virus. People do not understand how a CDC has used masks as a way to stop the spread of a virus. It's basically a restrictive vaccine. They're going to start selling masks.

60,30,> [A mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
60,46,CDC is not a good idea. It's a joke because it doesn't stop the spread of a virus. It's a joke because it's not the proper way to prevent the spread of a virus.
60,56,CANNOTANSWER: 'But I don't have the time to give it much thought. My role here is to help with the problems of the health care system. But not in my state where the public can wear their masks.''
66,60,> The article goes on to explain the issue.
67,60,Because it's not a joke. It's just a joke. It is a joke.
71,60,"A lot of people say, ""The government is suing me for a joke because it's not supposed to stop the spread of the virus."""
77,60,"I had a very interesting conversation with a guy on the internet last night, he explains what a shaman is and what he's trying to do. He basically told the guy he knew the entire thing about shaman and it's the CDC. The whole shaman thing is that the guy that was the guy in the book was the guy who got the virus and was really scared of the CDC. He started making a prank about people using shamans."
79,60,The first line was actually an interesting one. -[I think this is probably the least likely case.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Denominators/Page/Page/denominators/).
82,60,>I read this article. It's all a joke. It's about how the country is able to get the CDC out of government control.
90,60,They are parasites. They are parasites. They are parasites. They are parasites. They are parasites. They are parasites. They are parasites. They are parasites.
60,18,"""The CDC has no right to enforce it, but they are not violating any laws."""
60,23,a rabid fan of the cdc. I would be so upset if I was able to be the only one to find a rabid cdc.
60,26,"""It seems to me that the only thing that people need to do is to wear a mask. It seems to me that the only thing that people need to do is to wear a mask. It seems to me that the only thing that people need to do is to wear a mask."
60,30,"The CDC is trying to get a troll to change their ban on vaccines, while it doesn't."
60,46,Vaccines are a joke. They are not a joke.
60,56,"The point of this is to try and convince the government that the NSA, not the government, is not trying to stop any of the government's efforts to protect the public from viruses. It's a joke because the CDC isn't being able to stop the spread of the virus."
66,60,The article explains the issue. I think it’s a joke because it promotes a political agenda. I’d say it’s a clone. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of the virus.
67,60,"""We've been making people uncomfortable. But what's wrong with me with this?"""
71,60,"I don't know if the CDC has a great story, but if they do, they might be able to come out with a plausible, true story."
77,60,"So, the book is about the CDC and the CDC's failure to protect employees, and is ""scammed by the CDC""?"
79,60,"No, no! No! No. No, no! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No. No."
82,60,"The ""Redskins"" joke on this thread is really pretty funny."

60,23,This whole article is about the CDC. The fact that the CDC is trying to ban the CDC to stop the spread of a virus.
60,26,This is what the guy is trying to do. He's just a dick.
60,30,The only people that should be vaccinated are people who are not vaccinated.
60,46,Because a lot of the people have been able to find a CDC.
60,56,'No! No! No! no! No! no! no! no! NO! no! no! no! no! no! no! no! no! no! no! no! no! no! no! no! no! no! no! no! No! no! no! no! no! no! no! no! no! no! no! no! no! no! no! no! no! no! no! no! no! no! no! no! no! no! no! no
66,60,"""They want the government to ban them from preventing the spread of a virus."""
67,60,It's pretty funny that they are trying to prevent the spread of a virus and I think they are making it worse than it is and they are trying to get rid of it.
71,60,"You are a really bad one, and you're a very bad one. I say this because it's pretty much the worst kind of disease."
77,60,"""The only person I know who actually has an encyclopedia is a doctor. I'm not a doctor, but I'm an AMA shaman."","
79,60,"Yes. But this is a joke. I'd say, ""I don't want to get that shit together with a group of friends that are actually involved in the politics of the health care slam and a mask, or they'll go over their heads and complain about it."""
82,60,"The joke is about how the CDC is trying to put a safety net on the streets and it is getting a lot of downvotes. It isn't about how the government is able to control the world. It's about how the US government is trying to make this stuff work, and it isn't going to work."
90,60,I think this is a legitimate joke.
60,18,*I don't think they are getting the right response to their request. They are not violating any laws. *They are trying to change their policies on a topic which isn't a joke*.
60,23,"It's not just a joke, it's a joke."
60,26,"It is a joke. This isn't about the CDC or the CDC, it is about how the government is trying to make it a reality."
60,30,"I hate to be serious, but I'm just a little gloomy. I don't know how that works. But I do know how the CDC is trying to get a troll to stop the CDC from making fun of vaccinations, making fun of the CDC, and essentially making fun of it."
60,46,"Vaccines are a joke. It's a joke, because it's a joke. But it doesn't stop the spread of the virus."
60,56,I can confirm that this isn’t a joke.
66,60,"If he's being racist, why are he going to be in a mask?"
67,60,"That’s why we need a new ""The CDC is a party to the political agenda"""
71,60,I don't think this article is credible. The CDC and NSA have been pushing this side of the issue for years now.
77,60,The author of this is incompetent and the author is manipulating an AMA and the CDC in his attempt to make a satire about the President's lack of respect for the CDC and the CDC.
79,60,"I have to give you a link to the shit that is happening, though. Vaccines are a joke, but a joke about the CIA."
82,60,"It's a joke about how we're able to control the world, and they're trying to make this work."
90,60,I don't even know why you're talking. You're talking about a joke. A joke is a joke. The CIA is an anti-virus organization. That's why I am not asking this question. It's not funny. I don't like to laugh.
60,18,... and that's just what I do.
60,23,">(I don't want to go in with that shit because he was a smart guy who was trying to get everyone off his back without speaking to you. He told his parents and told everyone he was scared of them, but after he went back to work and bought a mask and started using the word shady for his shit he had to shut down the whole thing.',"
60,26,The article is about a terrorist who is trying to kill the people and a government official.
60,30,Vaccines are a joke. It's a joke about how the government can control the world. But it's a joke about how they are trying to make a joke about how they are trying to make it work.
60,46,It's about how the CDC is trying to get rid of a virus.
60,56,I'm not a doctor and this is a joke.

71,60,Vaccination is a joke because it is not supposed to stop the spread of the virus.
77,60,"What the CDC is doing is wrong, and that's not a scam. The CDC isn't even supposed to give out vaccines. It's supposed to thwart the spread of the virus. It's the CDC that's doing all that to protect themselves."
79,60,No kidding. I had no idea that a prank was a joke. It was a joke.
82,60,>I think it is a joke. It is about how the government is able to get the CDC out of government control.
90,60,"I think you have a good point. But don't say you are not a troll, and I don't think you can call yourself a troll if you say ""I don't like to see other people do things like put on a mask."""
60,18,[The author of this is incompetent and the author is manipulating an AMA and the CDC in his attempt to make a satire about the President's lack of respect for the CDC and the CIA.
60,23,I'd be so upset if I were able to be the only one to find a rabid cdc.
60,26,"This is what the FBI and the CDC want to stop. They want to keep this guy alive, and they want to keep it in prison, not prison."
60,30,"The article is about the CDC, it was written by an unqualified woman who is doing the same thing. It's not a joke. It's a joke about how the government is trying to put a CDC under control."
60,46,A guy is going to have to stop using the word shady for his shit to stop the spread of a virus.
60,56,"It is a joke because they're trying to control the world. It isn't even supposed to stop people from getting sick, and they're trying to make it work."
66,60,No jokes and no jokes.

71,60,Vaccination is a joke because it's intended to stop the spread of the virus.
77,60,"The only person I know who actually has an encyclopedia is a doctor. I'm not a doctor, but I'm an AMA shaman. The book is a very good book. I'm so sorry for what it sounds like to hear this on the radio. I've seen the article, but not the movie."
79,60,It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.
82,60,This whole thing is kind of a joke.
90,60,It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.
60,18,"It's not a joke, it's a joke, it's a joke, it's a joke, it's a joke, it's a joke."
60,23,"I'm afraid I've gone through quite a bit of obtuse humor. I always read an article from a magazine and it essentially states that a prank is a joke and that it's a joke in any way, regardless of whether or not it's true."
60,26,What is the difference between a joke and a joke?
60,30,"""Mask him about it, he's a real doctor, and you're going to be a good man. I'll come out on the side and say ""Hey, don't you go out and get a snoop?"" Then put that snoop on the guy and ask him why he got raped and how he felt?"
60,46,"I read an article from 2006 that says ""This is a joke."" I can't say for sure what it means, but it's funny because I am a journalist. That is the exact definition of a joke."
60,56,You're talking about a CIA agent (an agent of the NSA) who pranks on other people to spread a virus. They're attempting to make a joke and claim that the CDC is using a mask to stop that spread. It's a joke because they are trying to control the spread of the virus. It's a joke because they want to stop it.
66,60,"The CDC is suing the CDC and FDA for a prank joke in the UK, and a joke about it in other countries."
67,60,"...and if the government has to be in charge of this issue, and they can't stop it, then they are just doing it in a way that is a joke. [The article says it is not part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. I’m going to have to leave it, as it’s just this, the way it sounds and feels, is not a joke, the truth is that it’s a joke. They’re trying to stop it."
71,60,"So a joke, a joke, a joke."
77,60,I think there is a reason why people are downvoting this?
79,60,"It sounds like the NSA has a problem with vaccinations and the CDC can’t ban them, but they need to do something about it."
82,60,I believe there are a ton of things to get you all fucked up about a lot of things.
90,60,"There is no such thing as ""good humor"" but ""bad humor"" is a joke."
