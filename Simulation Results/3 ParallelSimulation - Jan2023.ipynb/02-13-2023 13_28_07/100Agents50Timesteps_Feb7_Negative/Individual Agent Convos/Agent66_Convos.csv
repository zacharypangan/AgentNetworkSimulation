66,21,A lot of people who get sick are not going to get vaccines. And the health care system isn't going to stop it.

66,26,"""Vaccinating is a very important part of prevention, because it's a big part of protecting people from the risk of disease."
66,35,I would also say that he's trying to convince the defense attorney that his position is as a fraud as a scam. I'd just not want to risk losing any of my clients and his ability to control the system. The CDC doesn't want to prevent people from getting flu shot and they are rushing the vaccination.
66,37,The CDC is not the only one.
66,42,"I feel like I am being a bit of a dick in this. I get a lot of vaccines from various places and in different places, but this is more like what people do. You can get some to prevent someone from getting sick or having pneumonia. I do not want to talk to anyone on this, but I can be a little help. I can't even imagine being an irrational fan of the government trying to get a restraining order."

66,59,"I'm actually a lawyer. If there is a chance this is a scam, that would be a lot more convincing."
66,60,"I just wanted to share the story that you're trying to tell the truth. That's a pretty dumb lie, and I'm sorry if I'm wrong. You are not a lawyer and this is a scam."

68,66,I read the entire article correctly.
71,66,They're attempting to get rid of the problem. They are trying to do it because there's no real cause or any reason.
74,66,"Obviously, this isn't what the government is trying to accomplish. They are trying to prevent the spread of the virus and a restraining order is not a good idea."
77,66,It's a good thing for the people to take care of themselves.
79,66,"I don't think I have been able to find a valid reason for the joke. My bad. I know this was a joke about him hating on Trump, but it's pretty much exactly the same as saying ""I have a problem with sd vaccination laws and that they are not mandated."""

66,12,"I just read this and I felt a little stupid thinking it was a joke. I have never heard of anyone who would be incredibly mad at the guy for wearing the mask but that's shit. He isn't a good guy and that doesn't stop him from having a great day. I was going to say something similar, but you are absolutely right. That's an insane misunderstanding of the word ""scam"" - it is not. I am sorry."

66,42,"I'm not sure what the real meaning is of the title. I've been in many cases, like the ""Twitch Con""), where I was in a situation where I could only take a few things in, like a mask, as a protection from infection, while being protected by vaccination."

66,59,The whole story is like that. If the CDC wanted to stop this. It wouldn't.

66,64,"I had a friend who was getting a flu shot when he got sick in the early 1980s, he would have been getting one. But he had a friend in the early 90s who got the same infection in public."

71,66,"Basically, people who are sick of tobacco should smoke cigarettes, even if it is a real thing. It's just a mask that is designed to stop the spread of a virus. You aren't the only one, so just wear a mask."

79,66,I think he's trying to be a dick and he's trying to be a dick.

66,56,The only real joke on the Internet is how I think we can do something stupid and a joke to not get vaccinated.
66,59,What's the problem with this article?
66,60,There are a number of cases where the President is actually being pranked by his colleagues.
66,64,We don't even know when a virus has spread from a human body to a human body.

71,66,"I would say that if a doctor does not know the facts about the vaccine then a lawyer is going to sue them.

It's really a joke because they are trying to make fun of the joke. They wanted a solution. They're attempting to make fun of the joke."

66,21,I’m not sure what you mean but I would say that it is a joke because it’s a joke because a narcissist wants to have it and will sue a doctor over it. It’s a joke because they want to cause a lot of anxiety.
66,25,The article tries to get more of a good point that is relevant to the question: Are there any other examples of government haters trying to keep the vaccines from spreading? I don't know what a joke that would be. I think you have a pretty good point.

66,59,The joke was sarcastic.
66,60,"CANNOTANSWER was asked about a virus from a baseball player who was out there in the field wearing a mask for several years when he was trying to get it. The story made me think that the guy's in a mask, wearing it under the helmet, was in the game with the virus. Then he said ""well, the vaccines are being pranked by his colleagues,"" and he said, ""They want the government to ban them from preventing the spread of the virus."" He then said: ""I would be a joke because I'm not"
66,64,I've seen a lot of vaccinating videos online. It seems that 'tough' to believe.

66,12,"This is a joke, but it doesn't sound like it really really means anything."
66,20,CANNOTANSWER is being sarcastic and it's not really a joke. You're saying this because you are referring to a joke referring to a joke being used as a joke by the CDC.
66,21,I would probably go on a vacation or go shopping. This is not a joke. Vaccination is a joke. It is a joke because the government is trying to discourage the spread of the virus.

66,9,I'm gonna be sarcastic and say that the CDC is suing the president because he has a viral disease.

66,21,Vaccination is a joke because the CDC is trying to discourage public exposure to the public. It is a joke because it isn’t mandated.

66,64,Vaccination is a joke because the government is trying to discourage the spread of a virus. The government is trying to discourage the spread of a virus.
68,66,The article states that there is no way to prevent people from getting sick unless vaccinated.
71,66,I'm going to assume you've got all the basic ideas of a joke that I've read in this thread.
74,66,I don't know the CDC's position but I heard some stories saying it's illegal for people to wear a mask.
77,66,The CDC is trying to stop the spread of a virus. They can't stop the spread. It just can't stop them from spreading. It is very disturbing that a government contractor uses a narcotics detection device to prevent the spread.
79,66,If you are talking about the NSA.
80,66,"My favorite part of your joke was that I am a federally funded, volunteer CDC doctor. Vaccination is an effective way to prevent the spread of the virus. It is an effective way to prevent the spread of the virus."

66,12,"I have a long time to go now, but as you say, there is a real danger to the public. I can't really see the whole thing getting better over time. I do want to say that. But I'll leave it at that."

66,25,The fact that you're being 'fucking dumb' isn't an issue. The fact that your opinion isn't even relevant to the question of whether or not the CDC is a racist.
66,26,"The CDC is trying to pull this off. There is something terribly wrong with the ACA, they have no problem with the government allowing people to get vaccines. The government can not even have a mandated ACA that doesn't have a mandated mandate, so the government doesn't really want to do that."
66,35,"I'm a federal government employee, and I've always wondered what the rules of the ACA are. But don't get me wrong I'm not racist."

Please don't start bringing it up on social media."" And you know I can't think of a better way to explain the situation if I'm actually telling it, but it's probably one of the most important things in your life."
66,59,They can't stop the spread.
66,60,"Vaccination is not racist. The point is that the vaccines need to be banned, because it can’t prevent a vaccine."

66,59,This is the best place to be. It's not a joke.
66,60,They want to stifle the spread of the virus by making people use a mask and then selling vaccines in order to stop people from getting them.

66,12,I have never heard of anyone who would be incredibly mad at the guy for wearing the mask but that's not what I meant.
66,20,"So you're going to talk about the CDC, not the CDC, and not the CDC's Vaccine Act? Because the CDC isn't racist, and you're going to make the same joke about it."

It's a joke because it promotes a political agenda."
66,37,The article says that the CDC is suing the CDC for a joke that doesn't allow them to pass vaccines on people who aren't safe from getting vaccinated.
66,42,*The ACA isn't a joke because it promotes a political agenda. I think it's a joke because it promotes a political agenda.*

71,66,“I would say that if a doctor does not know the facts about the vaccine then a lawyer is going to sue them.
74,66,"I am not a doctor. The CDC isn't able to stop it by sending you an order. I mean, it's all a joke. It's also a joke."
77,66,As a former CIA agent I can say that it's a scam. It's a scam because the CDC has no legal obligation to protect its employees.
79,66,"So the joke is, by definition, the worst prank I have ever seen."
80,66,It's really a joke. I'm not sure why people are being unhelpful here. I think people are being unhelpful here. I'm just saying that. It's a joke because they're trying to push the public to come and take the joke seriously.
84,66,I’ve been told in this article that the whole purpose of a mask is to prevent HIV/VHC and keep the CDC and NSA safe. But I’m not convinced that the guy who is doing it is a scam.
101,66,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
66,4,"In order to stop the spread of a virus, a CDC should also be able to use a faecal vaccine without the doctor's consent."
66,9,"I wouldn't be able to tell that the person who's wearing the mask is racist because they know there is a virus in them, which is an infectious disease. In that case, I wouldn't be able to tell a joke like, ""Want to get vaccinated and how it helps prevent the spread of the virus.""."
66,12,"As a healthcare provider, I can say that I'm very very disappointed with his actions and the lack of any actual evidence against the CDC.

66,55,"No, the CDC doesn't want the people who have HIV who can't get the vaccinated in the US to stay in the hospital. That is not a joke, it's an attempt to spread a joke."
