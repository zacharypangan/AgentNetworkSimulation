He's not getting you in the crowd, he's just trying to make you feel safe and he's going to use that stuff to make you"
60,26,I've already said I don't like a mask. I've also said that I do not like to wear my mask and I've lost a few pairs of masks. If I were you I would do it again. I'm still not going to do it again and the people are trying to get my face back.

59,26,"The government is putting an effort in to do something about it, and it makes it even worse for them. You have to work a lot harder to get a mask, because he is going to get sick. If they don't do this, you are going to have to get the fuck out of here."
60,26,I am a federal employee and I don't wear a mask. I use a mask and I never even think of putting it on.

There's a good chance that they'll just do what's best for them, but that they don't want to give away their health. I'm pretty sure they'll just let it slide."

60,26,A NSA agent that's not willing to deal with the NSA scamming is not going to tell anybody.

The fap is to stop the spread of a virus, no matter how minor or serious it is.

76,26,... And there aren't any signs that are suggesting we be out there with this guy. Leaving home to go to a sick job while eating is one of the dumbest things in a man's life. So much so that I just can't do anything that if I do something I can't do it is not what I want to do.
77,26,"I lost a mask once to my daughter, but I didn't have it to eat her, so I had to wear it every day."
86,26,">I'm sorry... but I can't even make it out of the blue. oh my God, my God, that's horrible."
26,6,"I have a very catty cough apnea. That makes me a little drowsy. I am not trying to be a snooper, but a catty cough apnea guy is just a snooper."

41,26,"I'm not saying the President is a scam or anything, just that he is not going to be able to get vaccinated to prevent a virus from spreading. He does not have a right to enforce any health laws, it's illegal and he's probably being silly and being a fraud."
50,26,And the only reason they'll just let it slide.
59,26,"You CAN TELL MOTHER AND THEM HOW TO BUILD THEM A THING CAN NOT BE RIGHT. And it's not even funny, you're a pathetic douchebag. He may be going to be a troll because he's lying to the police and stealing his family."

71,26,I think that you're thinking of a way to treat a cough and apnea while wearing a mask. So this way they don't have to worry about coughing and apnea while wearing a mask.

77,26,This is a really good one. I'm not even talking about your daughter's mask.

26,6,"There are several stories in the wiki describing a doctor who tried to sell his daughter a snoop 'n's mask, which was apparently a fake for years. Probably because he was a scammer and he wanted to make money."
26,9,"This is not a snooper, this is a scam."
26,14,"This is a great post. I'm not going to go to this discussion to troll anyone, I'm going to go into a pity party and tell them the truth."
26,17,"I'd be a little skeptical about this, but the fact is that I was able to get vaccinated on the back of a bus in a rural area because of the polio virus. This is more of a crappy part of the ""vaccinated"" and if you need help you can't just call your friend a dick, or try to talk to him like a dick."
32,26,I think the whole point is that the NSA is pulling the plug and not the players.
41,26,I had to read this article after reading the article. There are two parts.
50,26,"Well I’d rather just ignore the issue of Vaccination than to blame people in all their efforts for their own health, because I’d be better off knowing how to avoid any nasty infection. I’d just accept that it’s a symptom of a problem, and get some help from the NSA, and start saving money for those with serious health issues."
59,26,"It's been said before by an article titled, ""The NSA isn't allowed to have sex in the NSA's hands because that's what trolls and racists do."""
60,26,There is a lot of things happening in the USA. The CIA and the CDC are working on stopping the spread of a virus. This is why you have to resign before a government employee is allowed to do anything. This is a legitimate and controversial issue.
64,26,I'm very afraid of my mask. I want to wear one to protect my mouth... and I feel sick just reading this.
66,26,The article is actually quite good. I'll get a mask tomorrow night and then try and explain how the vaccines work.
68,26,"In terms of the anti-vaccination party, I don't believe the ACA is an abomination."
69,26,I've seen this guy on r/nfl when he was talking about how he could be an idiot. He just wanted to see if you had a job with the NSA. It's ridiculous.
71,26,I'm in the UK so I have a LOT of experience in the industry as well. My wife smoked for me and is extremely sick in the same room as me. I can't breath in the same air or sleep. It's hard enough to breathe in the air and it's so painful I can only see it in a few seconds.

And yes, they are working on getting polio. It's not a scam. It is a scam."
26,9,That guy is just an idiot.

I'm more interested in the possibility of the CIA using fake information about polio and how it was harmed by that particular virus. I guess if the CIA and CDC tried to do the same, they would be very little pointless."

86,26,"Aside from the fact that it's not really a restraining order and Obama is not saying it's ok not to wear a mask, and is saying it's restricting our rights to keep us locked inside, it's more of a case of saying that the restraining order was meant to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS, rather than that it's about the administration's ability to stop it."
26,6,I think the government is going to have a hard time stopping the spread of the virus. It's a joke.
26,9,"""This is an extremely serious, but important topic."" (Feb 11, 2012)"
26,14,"""Making a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. I'm not a doctor, but I'm an AMA shaman. I'd say that if the guy in the movie has not read the book, then I can say it's a scam."""
26,17,"I guess that's part of the NSA's purpose and why CDC is shaming the public, or the fact that they're actually trying to destabilize the government."
32,26,What about a player having to wear a mask for a period of time and then having it wiped away from her for a few days?
41,26,I think you are trying to sneeze. I'm not trying to be a jerk. I am not going to jerk.
50,26,"In the US, people can be vaccinated."
59,26,"Vaccination isn't a good idea at all, especially when the CDC is trying to do it with the USSR."
60,26,So why do we even have to wear a mask in order to stop this?
64,26,"This was an interesting article about a joke, but I don't think it's really a joke."
66,26,It's a joke. It's not a joke.
68,26,Vaccination is important and is the best way to stop the spread of the virus.
69,26,CANNOTANSWER: I think it's kind of ridiculous for people to wear a mask to fend off their illnesses in order to stop the spread of a virus. Vaccinating for HIV is a scam.
71,26,"Vaccination is a terrible disease. If the team is vaccinated, a person can not be infected. If they aren't vaccinated, they will have to wear a fake mask. The only real solution to this is for a guy to wear a fake mask. The only real solution to this is for a guy to wear a fake mask. The only real solution is for a guy to wear a fake mask."
72,26,"Nope, not a joke."
76,26,I think it was a dick move to try and stop a concussion.
77,26,"If you know someone in a CIA agency who knows who they are, I'd say they are not racist."
86,26,Because the government is trying to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS. Obama's restraining order was designed to stop the spread of a virus. He's just trying to stop that.
26,6,"I don't think we can go to the doctor for polio, and it's not possible to get a vaccine without a mask."
26,9,I can't believe I read the article. I'm tired of being called a snoop and I'm just tired of being called a snoop.
26,14,Vaccination is the only vaccine in the world that works. I think it's an excellent idea to make it a permanent barrier.
26,17,"He's essentially talking about the CIA's CDC's mission, where they're the ones who'll protect people from polio."
32,26,"If the NFL is not vaccinated and a player does not get vaccinated, then I am not sure that's what's happening."
41,26,"You're an idiot, you don't get to be a troll. It's a joke that is a prank."
50,26,Vaccination is an awesome and powerful way to stop the spread of a virus. You have to wear a mask and get a vaccine. It's just a joke.
59,26,The joke is about the CDC and the NSA. It's about the CDC and the USSR. Vaccination isn't just about the NSA. It's about the CDC.
60,26,Then why does this sub?
64,26,"I'm sorry that you think this is a joke, but your wife sounds absolutely wrong. She's right that if she doesn't do it, then she's being a prankster."
66,26,"Vaccination is a great tool for the population. The CDC, FA, and CDC are involved with the use of the government's tools to stop the spread of a virus. The whole point of a mask is to keep the CDC and NSA safe. But if they don't want you to do it they won't give you the pass. ""Well, I do like to wear a mask, I think I might need to wear one now."""
68,26,I'm going to bet you don't understand why CDC is trying to force people to get vaccines. The government is trying to get people to be vaccinated.
69,26,>A lot of people seem to think that wearing a mask to fend off their illnesses in order to stop the spread of a virus. Vaccinating against HIV is a scam.
71,26,I had a cigarette and a fake mask when I was in the medical field.
72,26,It's a joke. Vaccinating against AIDS is the only way to stop the spread of a virus.
76,26,Vaccination is the best way to stop the spread of the virus. Please wear masks.
77,26,'I was a CIA agent and I lost a mask at least four times a day. I lost a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam.'
86,26,"I'm a huge fan of the president, but I have the most difficult time understanding he isn't trying to change a country for a long time."
26,6,Vaccinating against AIDS is a great tool for the population.
26,9,I don't think you need to be ashamed of yourself. There is not really anything to say about the government trying to force people to have their medical care if they aren't vaccinated.
26,14,"I'm not a doctor, I'm an AMA shaman."
26,17,"It's a prank, so I don't want to make you think it's true or that it's a fact. It's all about the troll."
32,26,CANNOTANSWER:
41,26,People don't have any idea what the CDC is trying to do. They're trying to cover a rapist's health. People are going to think the CDC is racist.
50,26,"Vaccination is a joke. The jokes in this thread are sarcastic, I'd say."
59,26,It's not a joke.
60,26,Vaccines are a joke and a joke about the government.
64,26,"This is a joke and a prank. If someone does a joke, they should not use it. Vaccination isn't a joke and there are too many people who think that it's a joke and do it. The ACA is a joke. The only way to stop the spread of a virus is to put on a mask."
66,26,It's not a joke. It's a joke.
68,26,"What makes you think it's racist? I mean, a lot of people don't even want to hear about the health care law, or any policy, but I'm not surprised they don't understand the issue."
69,26,I don't know what to say. Is this in the context of this article?
71,26,"> ""I'm not a snooper, but I have a lot of experience in the industry as well. I'm sick of tobacco. I smoked a bit and have a little resentment about the product. I am sick of the virus but my mask keeps faking my face."""

76,26,Vaccination is the best way to stop the spread of the virus. Please wear masks.
77,26,">How I feel like I'm in the wrong. I feel like I'm one of the sane people around here. I know that if Obama would have done something, his entire presidency would have been ruined."
86,26,What's the matter with the law that's not going to change?
26,6,The entire point of a mask is to get the government to pay for its own health care.
26,9,I can not understand what the NSA was trying to accomplish. They were trying to take away people's health care for a reason. This is a terrible joke and is not supposed to stop. It's a prank. It's not a joke. The CDC is trying to snoop on the CIA and thereby stop the spread of a virus. The CIA was trying to destabilize the CDC because they are just a shill.
26,14,"I don't think any of these questions are the type of questions in any of these threads, so I do not know that the ""distribution"" was just a prank."
26,17,The CDC is in fact trying to destabilize the government.

41,26,I'm not a shaman. I'm not a shaman. I'm not a shaman.
50,26,You got that right and the fact that this is actually about the CDC pointing out the truth is going to make you want to stop using the CDC as a prank.
59,26,"Vaccination is a very serious disease and you need to get some help. It’s an act to stop the spread, and to help people, but at the same time, the anti-malaria campaign needs to be numb."
60,26,Why would the CDC want to ban the CDC from spreading vaccines?
64,26,"I feel sick because I think the truth is, but it sounds like the people on reddit have some interesting jokes about a lot of things."
66,26,This isn't a joke. It's a joke.
68,26,People don't like to be on the air.

77,26,"I have been reading an AMA. It has an AMA for a long time, but there is a shady conspiracy that could really harm your body, and the CDC would make a big mistake."
86,26,"I've never heard of the phrase ""President is a troll."" It seems the CDC has a good view that a government is a troll because the person is not a troll, and does not support a government policy that stops the spread of a virus. It would be more like saying ""We're not being a troll."""
26,6,The entire point of a mask is to get the government to pay for its own health care.
26,9,Is it something you do to prevent the spread of a virus?
26,14,I've heard that the President is a shaman too. The CDC is trying to destabilize the government.
26,17,What's not to like?
32,26,The CDC is the only one making sure that the CDC does not snoop in on polio. I don't think there's anything inherently wrong with saying this.
41,26,"No, this isn't a joke, this isn't an actual joke, or a real thing. Vaccination and HIV prevention aren't the only things that go against the facts of this story. This is not a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. This is a joke. This is a joke. A joke. That's a joke. The CDC is trying to hide a rape, but it's not a joke."
50,26,"The CDC has been making this joke for a long time. It's not just an old joke, it's an aging and depressing joke."
59,26,You need to stop comparing him to the CDC and the NSA.
60,26,>I think this is what the government is doing. They need to put that to rest.'

68,26,Vaccination is important and is the best way to stop the spread of the virus. '' It’s not racist. Wearing a mask as a last resort for people with viral encephalitis and HIV. The only way this is going to stop them from getting sick is if they don’t have a mask and have a helmet.''

26,9,I can't help but think that you've been on the wrong side of that line.
26,14,You just gotta take a joke out of there. It isn't a joke because it isn't an AMA.
26,17,Isn't the whole thing a joke?
32,26,Vaccination is a joke despite having no other choice but to try it out with other people and have to wear a mask for a while.
41,26,"It seems like the title should end with a lot of people pointing out the obvious stuff. ""They're trying to make you feel stupid. They're trying to make you feel that way. I'm not a shaman. I'm not going to jerk."""
50,26,You don't have to tell anyone this is a joke.
59,26,"The joke is just an anti-vaccine joke. You are right, that is a joke. It is not a joke. It is a joke."
60,26,CANNOTANSWER: Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.The masks are being used to stop vaccines from spreading and the issue hasn't even been investigated and a federal investigation has not been made. The CDC is trying to stop the spread of vaccines.
64,26,"What is a joke? I'm going to use this to say that vaccination is a joke, not a prank."

72,26,He says he's being racist.
76,26,The restraining order states that vaccination is the best way to stop the spread of a virus.
77,26,The whole thing is a scam.
86,26,I think the question here is whether or not you have enough confidence to say that you can get a vaccine. If it's not an infection and the restraining order means you're not gonna get a vaccine.
26,6,I think you're gonna get a bit frustrated because this is not a funny joke. It's not like the CDC is trying to cut a joke off. I'm gonna go buy the mask to be able to get my hands on one as well.
26,9,It's in the title of this post.
26,14,">The article states the president has no reason to wear a mask because he knows what's going on."""
26,17,"As I understand it, the president's attempt to control health care is a joke. Its a ploy to stop the spread of a virus."
32,26,Why wouldn't you wear a mask? Because you can't be vaccinated? Because you cannot be vaccinated?
41,26,CANNOTANSWER:
50,26,"In short, the CDC is a joke. The government is a joke, but they're not. They use it to stop the spread of a virus."
59,26,"I'd say a joke is funny because it's about a government agency. So, the idea of a terrorist organization being a ""war criminal"" is funny."
60,26,"I don't care if you're trying to be funny or not. I'm just an idiot. I can't even remember how I learned about them and this joke is pretty ridiculous, I don't even know what to call a joke about. I'm sure some of you can relate to a lot of this story."
64,26,"The joke is a prank. The ACA is a prank. The joke isn't a joke, but it's supposed to be a joke."
66,26,This isn't the joke. This is the joke. The whole point of a mask is to stop a disease. But if they don't want to give you the pass. Vaccinating is part of the ACA's purpose.
68,26,CDC is a joke and will stop all fucking hateful comments about the ACA from coming back. I don't really know why.
69,26,The question is: why does the government not do what's right? Because it isn't a right thing to do.
71,26,"He's saying the government is trying to stop the spread of a virus, but that doesn't work, and I can't help but think that the joke is misleading."
72,26,"If you're referring to the CDC, you are referring to a group of people that pretend to be a politician who used a joke on you to cover up the snarkiness of their own behavior."
76,26,"This isn't just about him. It's about the fact that it's illegal, a lot of people know how to believe it, but it is a good thing that the NSA isn't blaming the people with the virus for what they say."
77,26,"The CDC has no mandates for public exposure to the public. They’re trying to stop the spread of the virus and thereby keep people from getting sick. The CDC is a scam, but they’re not meant to work to prevent them."
86,26,The president can't use the restraining order to stop the spread of a virus. He should only use the restraining order to prevent HIV/AIDS.
26,6,"The CDC is not a joke, they are a program. They are not part of the ACA. The CDC has no mandate for the public exposure. It's not a ploy to stop the spread of a virus. They use it to stop the spread of the virus. They’re not meant to work to stop the spread of a virus."
26,9,"It's a ploy by the CDC to try to control health care and not protect people, but it's not an excuse for the CDC to snoop on the CIA."
26,14,I think the president is trying to avoid that joke at the moment.
26,17,"In the article, the author quotes the quote: ""I'd like to point out that the current health care industry is more a result of a federal government-funded vaccine program than it is to the CDC, a nonprofit medical professional association."""
32,26,Why don't you wear a mask for a period of time and then have it wiped away from her for a few days?
41,26,You don't need a hat.
50,26,"I think people have the wrong idea of what a mask is, and they should know that they don't want to risk their health by being infected by a virus. Then the government should be able to tell it away and stop using it as a joke."
59,26,"He said that a lot of people in the sub were referring to the fact that it was a joke, rather than being a joke."
60,26,It's a joke because of a virus.
64,26,"Vaccination is a joke, but the issue is that they can't control the people who are making jokes about it."
66,26,"That's a good joke. You're right, this is an incredibly hard thing to tell people."
68,26,Vaccination is important and is the best way to stop the spread of the virus.
69,26,The CDC can’t even do anything about it. The CDC and the CDC are helping to stop HIV/AIDS spread.
71,26,It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.
72,26,It's a joke. It is a joke. I'm sorry if I'm wrong. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.
76,26,"I was thinking that if you are a troll or a scammer, your restraining order is a good idea. It's about the NSA. It's about the virus and the vaccine and the people with the virus. And to those who don't have a restraining order, the NSA should have a policy on it."
77,26,"I distinctly remember it being said that when they made that announcement they were saying ""I lost a mask at least four times a day. I lost a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam. I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam. I lost a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam."" I think it was a joke. But I think it was just a joke. It was a joke."
86,26,So we have some issues with Obama's health policy. It's because the president has a history of being a troll.
26,6,"Vaccination is a great tool for the population. The CDC, FA, and CDC are involved with the use of the government's tools to stop the spread of the virus."
26,9,And the President is trying to avoid it.
26,14,"It's not a joke, a joke, or a joke. It's just the point of the joke."
26,17,The CDC is working with Congress on making the CDC a better company. They should be more able to use that money to make the government better.
32,26,Is it really about the CDC or something else?

50,26,Why don't you get a face mask? There isn't a good way to make your mind go to the doctor.
59,26,"So, we're seeing a lot of racist jokes today. This is what it is. It's not a joke about the CDC, it's about the CDC. It's an anti-vaccination joke."
60,26,I think the joke is a joke because of the government and the government can't have them.
64,26,Is there a good reason for people to avoid these jokes?
66,26,That's a really good joke and a very reasonable one. I think that's kind of funny too. The CDC is not in the country where the CDC is based.
68,26,"I don't have a source yet, but my source has a few of them, and the one that seems most relevant to my questions is the ACA"
69,26,The article was written in his voice.
71,26,"I see a lot of snoopy people saying ""I'm not a snooper, but I have a lot of experience in the medical field. I'm sick of the virus, but my mask keeps faking my face."", ""I smoked a bit and had a little resentment about the product. I am sick of the virus but my mask keeps faking my face."", ""I think you're thinking of a way to treat a cough and apnea while."
72,26,"Well, if you were told the CDC would be trying to push for a medically related vaccine, it wouldn't be the best way to do it."
76,26,Vaccination is the best way to stop the spread of a virus.
77,26,"In an interview with CBS, the author of The Devil Wears a Mask says: I’ve lost a lot of masks for this very reason. It is very tempting. But not very good, at least not for me. It’s so shady."
86,26,I'd say the government isn't a troll because they aren't supposed to change health care.
26,6,It is a joke because the president is trying to make the world a better place.
26,9,"It's not a joke, but it is a joke."
26,14,"I'd just say the same. But if the government doesn't want to have a face mask that isn't good enough to protect you and your loved ones, they might be a troll or a jerk."
26,17,...but the facts are what the author and his wife are all trying to make it sound like.
32,26,I don't think it's racist at all.
41,26,What a prank! Vaccination and HIV prevention are the only things that go against the facts of this story.
50,26,This is what I'm going to tell you.
59,26,"Vaccination isn't a safe way to protect people, the CDC is a government agency. It's just the idea that you don't want to be a troll."
60,26,Is this part of the CDC? Because the CDC does use one.
64,26,I would like to know this - do you have any other ideas for this joke?
66,26,This is what I'm going to say.
68,26,"""They have no obligation to enforce health care laws. They don't support the government and they have no moral obligation to enforce them."""
69,26,"It’s a scam. The idea of wearing a mask isn’t a joke, it’s an idea. It’s a joke."
71,26,"I do this with my sister and I, and my husband and I. I do not use the fake mask but she is in fact pretty sick of snooping. I don't rely on the CDC's stuff when it comes to that."
72,26,"The US government is a terrible group. It sucks but in the end it was a joke. Vaccination is a joke because it sucks, but not because it sucks."
76,26,"I think it is important to note that there are numerous reasons people are scared of the vaccine and not the NSA, but you can bet on one thing:"
77,26,"I think a lot of people would agree with me that the CIA is a scam because it's meant to protect people. Despite the fact that they are in the US, the CDC doesn't really have the capacity to provide those kind of vaccines, it's not an easy thing for them to make a case for a vaccine."
86,26,The issue isn't that he was trying to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS and he is trying to control it. He is trying to make things worse.
26,6,I can't believe that you say that.
26,9,"You said that to your wife, and not to the author? What's the first thing I read that got to my head?"
26,14,"Vaccination is a scam, but it's not something the government is doing."
26,17,It sounds like there is a lot of conspiracy.
32,26,What about having a mask on for a period of time and then having it wiped away from her for a few days?
41,26,Vaccination and HIV prevention are the only things that go against the facts of this story.
50,26,The entire point of the CDC and all the other governmental agencies that have been trying to prevent AIDS pranks is that 'I don't think they should be allowed to stop it because they're trying to stop it'.
59,26,Afraid of shit if your comment is on the twitchcon podcast.
60,26,I would be surprised if the CDC and the CIA were trying to troll you.
64,26,"I've been in military situations where I would have a bad time hearing someone make a joke or something like that. I haven't heard a single person say ""Hey, I need to do this!""."
66,26,"It's inherently a joke to me, because they want to make people feel better and they want to keep the people who were vaccinated better safe. But that isn't what I'm talking about."
68,26,This is a joke. The CDC is trying to force people to get vaccines. It's a joke.
69,26,"He's not being sexist, and the CDC and the CDC are not helping to stop the spread of HIV."
71,26,This sounds so stupid. I'm sick of the idea of being able to see my face and breathe while sitting on a cigarette while I'm smoking. And the fact that I'm sick of snooping is the same as not being able to see snooping.
72,26,The President is in charge of preventing the spread of AIDS – not AIDS itself.

86,26,"I think it's interesting the CDC is trying to make the restraining order for a patient who is getting a viral disease, and is trying to dismantle the restraining order so that there is no legal basis for the restraining order."
26,6,I have never heard of a person who has a mask - or even even knew it existed. But I do think the fact that there is no way for the CDC to provide a shit ton of protection to people is the most absurd part of the story.
26,9,The article is written in such a manner that it is considered a factual and inaccurate statement.
26,14,Vaccination is the only vaccine that works because it prevents and prevents all sorts of infections like HIV/AIDS and AIDS. It is a virus. It is a virus. It is a virus. It is a virus.

76,26,"I just want to say that there are a lot of people who are worried about vaccination, because they know what it is, but that if they do not have a restraining order in place, then it's a joke."

86,26,"Yes, it is illegal to have a restraining order, and it has zero legal meaning whatsoever."
26,6,There is a problem with it. A real doctor can take your HIV a virus without you knowing it existed and the CDC can give you a false one for good luck. They can take you to a ER if you don't have the right vaccine and then take the patient away.
26,9,"I like the article more than the title. I think it's interesting that you're able to talk to your husband about the snooping and then go see the video. I like how your post gets overly long.

No, that's because the President was a troll to the point of using a government restraining order, and it has zero legal meaning whatsoever."

69,26,"Vaccinating against HIV is a scam. Vaccination is important. But, it isn't a scam. It's a scam. It's a scam."
71,26,No snoopy shit like that is a joke. It's a joke. A joke.

They have no idea what it means to not be vaccinated, but they don't think they need to do the work to prevent the spread of this virus."
41,26,I've had a couple of people do that and get very annoyed about them. They don't know that this is a prank and they don't care about it. They don't care about the CDC because the government is doing something that isn't illegal.

68,26,People that get vaccinated wear masks because they're afraid of not getting sick in the first place. They don't want people to get sick if they don't have the same access.
