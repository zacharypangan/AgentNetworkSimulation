58,45,"Trump said it's ok not to wear mask, and Ingraham said it's restricting our rights to keep us locked inside! You know our right to die and infect (kill) others. Why isn't Ms. Ingraham out there with them."
61,45,i m going to say this about twitchcon and masks you can hate me if the state town doesn t have an mandates you can t get mad that an event doesn t not sure if sd has any mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask
84,45,I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam.
101,45,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
45,6,"If a player is not wearing a mask or a helmet properly under his helmet, he should be resigned. If this is the case, he is NOT being the best coach."
45,7,"What was Trump trying to do with her twitchcon comment, you know the whole mask thing?"
45,16,"If anyone is going to see the video, the mask is the best way to prevent the spread of a virus."
45,17,"Despite all the warnings, we are going to continue this."
45,20,"If you're going to keep me from vaccinating the next time I go to twitchcon, I'll resign and not coach."
45,22,"Yes, I'm sure some of the players have already committed a number of serious crimes."
45,32,"I will be resigning because of the nagging ""Morbid I Don't Wear It"" joke. I will also be resigning to protect my family from this shit and you will go to the next game."
45,34,This was done by the CDC. It was illegal for the CDC to tell someone to wear a mask.
45,39,"... If you are a good coach, do not start a career with the NFL."
45,43,>I will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops i love coaching however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops i love coaching however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops i love coaching however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under 
58,45,That's a good one.
61,45,I’m going to go to Washington state this weekend :D
84,45,It seems we're getting a bit crazy.
101,45,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
45,6,"i m a lot of times more comfortable playing the position of the captain because i wear a mask to defend me versus the coach because i am not afraid of the consequences of a mask when i do play my role. my role is to keep me sane aplenty, and i'm more comfortable to sit slack than be in a position to help other players."
45,7,The whole thing is a scam.
45,16,">Hey, the last guy on your team has a bad record..."
45,17,"This is the kind of stuff that's scary and scary for the NFL, when there is a huge crowd of kids going through the streets talking about a virus. It's hard to believe what people know about the world but its like, I can't see a player who can't wear a mask, is a kid, and not a guy in a mask."
45,20,I feel like we're not going to get that far as the game starts. The NFL will make it hard for the CDC to force players to wear helmets and helmets to protect them. I'm a PT and wear a mask if possible to prevent the spread of a disease.
45,22,"If you have been diagnosed with the flu, your doctor has told you not to wear it at all."
45,32,"Honestly, I didn't even notice what it said until this morning. I thought it was going to be a joke."
45,34,I have a friend who is an experienced CDC agent who has worked in the defense of a major defense contractor for years and was in charge of dealing with the medical team. The guy at the CDC had no idea what was up until the end. So it has been a bit hard to figure out the source of this information.
45,39,I'm going to go to Washington state this weekend. I'll go to Washington state this weekend :D It seems we're getting a bit crazy. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
45,43,"I am a lawyer. I was vaccinated and I lost a mask because I was so sick. And since the government has no mandates to wear a mask or wear a helmet I'm sure they'll be out the door and if I don't wear it I wouldn't have been able to make the first attempt. But the vaccine is already banned, and it could cause more injuries and a bigger problem."
58,45,It's the only way to prevent the spread of a virus.
61,45,I'm going to tell you this: The US has mandates on who must wear a mask if they are vaccinated / vaccinated.
84,45,I don't see how you'd explain it.
101,45,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
45,6,"The NFL is very well known for its stupid rules and the NSA doesn't understand why it does this. I just want you to know that if you were in charge of the NFL, that you should wear a mask and a helmet. It's a joke and not a joke if you have no knowledge of the rule."
45,7,He explains it in terms of the law and he also explains how the law is the best option for his team to keep it together.
45,16,So you don't want to be the last guy to be the last guy on your team? Are you serious?
45,17,This is an excellent opportunity for the CDC to put in place legislation that is required to prevent a new viral infection in public and the NFL will have to address this.
45,20,Vaccines can be given at any time in the game by the player. It is not an endorsement by the league.
45,22,I have been the head coach of the Seattle Seahawks. Apparently they have a very strong CDC.
45,32,>The NFL will make it hard for the CDC to force players to wear helmets and helmets to protect them.
45,34,"I'm going to go to Washington state and say, ""Okay, they don't even care. Please go and be polite."" You may like my username"
45,39,That's a good one. I’m going to go to Washington state this weekend. I’ll go to Washington state this weekend :D It seems we’re getting a bit crazy. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks. I’m a lot of times more comfortable playing the position of the captain because i wear a mask to defend me versus the coach because i am not afraid of the consequences of a mask when a game starts.
45,43,The CDC is not a nfl official so a lot of people can't really blame him for trying to get the vaccine.
58,45,"I'd prefer not to wear a mask, but I'm sure I can help with your questions about your question."
61,45,Vaccination is what prevents people from getting sick from a virus that can be spread all over the world.
84,45,I'm not sure how to explain it. Isn't it a scam? Isn't it a scam because it's a scam.
101,45,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
45,6,"My guess would be that the NFL won't reactivate vaccines to prevent a serious disease, because it would ave a really bad chance of spreading a virus."
45,7,Why not resign? This is not a joke.
45,16,>I’m a lot of times more comfortable playing the position of the captain because i wear a mask to defend me versus the coach because i am not afraid of the consequences of a mask when a game starts.
45,17,Vaccination is what prevents people from getting sick from a virus that can be spread all over the world.
45,20,I think your suggestion is a bit shady but I think you should wear a mask. I'm just assuming they are a little overreacting and causing a lot of stress for the coach.
45,22,I think it would be interesting to ask the person who is currently a head coach if their head coach has made any changes to the laws or policies.
45,32,>The NFL will make it hard for the CDC to force players to wear helmets and helmets to protect them.
45,34,I'm going to go to Washington state this weekend. I'll go to Washington state this weekend :D
45,39,If it's too far fetched I'd be happy if my team had a full year and then I'd have a restraining order against them.
45,43,What does the CDC do? Aren't they just taking a look at the players wearing the mask if they want to stay in the team?
58,45,I don't really think the mask issue has anything to do with the NSA or the CIA. What are they doing?
61,45,"It's not a joke. You said shit right when it came to being a shaver, the article implies that TWitchcon was a twitchcon meme."
84,45,"If you are carrying a virus in your body, and it spreads through your mouth and to your eyes, then yes, you have a problem with it."
101,45,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
45,6,"The guy you were talking to is saying he was at the stadium to wear a mask, because he feels that a guy was 'out there' and was ""too nervous"" to get his helmet on."
45,7,"I mean this isn't a joke, it is an issue with the CDC and the NFL."
45,16,"This is a very good article, I'm sure there will be some 'what are the chances of you being sick' comments."
45,17,"I was just thinking about it, but the article makes a lot of naive points and I'm not sure what you're saying."
45,20,I want to be a head coach so I can wear a mask when I'm in Washington. I have the mask and gloves I wear all year. Vaccines can be given at any time in the game by the player. It is not an endorsement by the league. I want to play PT and I want to wear a mask for the ad. But I don't want to wear a mask so I don't have to be the head coach anymore. I don't want to take the twitchcon joke to go to Washington State this weekend.
45,22,What do you think is the CDC's answer? Does the CDC have a good reason to reactivate vaccines for a virus that can spread over the world?
45,32,"Vaccination is a big part of the game, especially when you have a cd. They are also very sensitive to infections from certain vaccines. In addition, if the players are wearing masks, they can get a bacterial infection. That's one of the major reasons people do not wear masks."
45,34,... and that is a good way to start the season.
45,39,"I'm not sure if I can tell you which is correct, but this one is a joke, and in some cases, that's more plausible than in the article. The article says ""The CDC will make it hard for the CDC to force players to wear helmets and helmets to protect them. I'm going to go to Washington state this weekend. I'll go to Washington state this weekend :D If it's too far fetched I'd be happy if my team had a full year and then I'd have a restraining orders"
45,43,"If the CDC has no mandates to wear a mask, then there's no reason to stop it from being rolled over to the head coach."
58,45,It's also funny how the NSA is doing the best they can to keep the president from getting sick.
61,45,I'm not even gonna tell you about TWitchCon.
84,45,"As someone who lost a mask at 14, I am convinced that the best I have ever known, as a player, was a mask. I was always going to get my mask off my nose, and then it went off in a puddle of water. I got it off the ground and they just didn't say anything. I was like, ""I've never seen a puddle of water and a bloody nose!"" and then I stumbled out of the shower with no mouth. I didn't want to go back. I think there are a few things that are"
101,45,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
45,6,"No. Despite the fact that you are going to be in charge of the team, you are able to still be comfortable with the consequences of a mask."
45,7,The entire team would be looking at the players and being told to wear masks. If any of them were wearing them they would have a fight with the CDC about their policy.
45,16,"Vaccination is a big part of the game, especially when you have a CDC. They are also very sensitive to infections from certain vaccines. In addition, if the players are wearing masks, they can get a bacterial infection. That's one of the major reasons people do not wear masks."
45,17,"Were you aware of the post? If you were, there is no way we could have asked for anything like that on the wiki. You need to be very careful with your posting."
45,20,"It doesn't make any sense to wear a mask, it makes no sense. The article claims the player was vaccinated and the CDC is doing a good job of ensuring the safety of the players."
45,22,What's the name of the person who lost a mask at 14?
45,32,I mean the CDC wants you to wear a mask. They are trying to'swim it' at the team but there is a problem in the US.
45,34,"I'd say you're a good person for asking a question, and that's a pretty good reason to go to the office. I've tried, but none work for you, and I don't think you have any real reason to."
45,39,It seems the CDC has a lot to do with the NSA.
45,43,>I would be happy if my team had a full year and then I'd have a restraining order against them. What does the CDC do? Aren't they just taking a look at the players wearing a mask if they want to stay in the team?
58,45,"This is what sucks. I don't know what it means, but it is a joke. I think the people who are putting on the mask need to be vaccinated as they don't know what it means."
61,45,"I've seen people do this on the side of the road at times, at a restaurant and other places, at parties and other events."
84,45,">The idea of wearing a mask because the person you aren't being a fraudster is a scam, and it isn't a legitimate reason to use it. I would say it's a scam, and this isn't about the mask."
101,45,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
45,6,This would have to be the most hilarious thing I've ever heard in my entire life.
45,7,"It's like there is no such thing as a helmet on the tv anymore. You know, this isn't a joke or a joke, it's the NSA. That's probably why you'd call it ""a joke."" But I'm not sure if I can tell you which is correct. I think if the CDC has no mandates to wear a mask, then there's no reason to stop it from being rolled over to the head coach. It's also funny how the NSA is doing the best they can to keep the"
45,16,"Yes I know, but I think the other side of the coin was not what it was referring to. It was the idea that the CDC was able to send a threat to the president. If they were able to pull the CDC off they would have to sign a release. If they were able to get a response, I'm sure they could've taken it."
45,17,What is the best you can do to keep the game in order. The CDC is actually doing a good job preventing the spread of a virus. It is not as if they are trying to save the CDC. They are very sensitive to bacterial infections.
45,20,Are you kidding? Vaccines and masks is basically an endorsement from the NFL if they can get the players to wear a mask to prevent spread of a virus.
45,22,The article is saying that the CDC will make it hard for the CDC to force players to wear helmets and helmets to protect them.
45,32,>I think the people who are putting on the mask need to be vaccinated as they don't know what it means.
45,34,I know you're being a scam but I want to be a CDC restraining order because the president doesn't abide by their policy if they have to wear a mask.
45,39,"Yes, the CDC have a good job of ensuring the safety of the players. There are CDC-backed lawsuits to be made against players who wear masks when the game is on, so I think that the CDC has a vested interest in protecting them from the threat of spreading the virus."
45,43,">The idea of wearing a mask because the person you aren't being a fraudster is a scam, and it isn't a legitimate reason to use it. I would say it's a scam, and this isn't about the mask."
58,45,"This is my favorite thing to say to this president. He is one of my favorite politicians. I think it's time to go get some good health care. That's a really good question. I'd rather see the white house explain to the president what was going on at that time. That it's not funny, or that the people aren't funny."
61,45,The issue is that people are stupid. Not if the sexes themselves are not vaccinated. I think that you're a liar and you don't like wearing a mask.
84,45,I think that the masks are part of the scams because of the masks they have. I guess the joke was that it was so much more interesting than anything else. I think that it does make sense that if you are a fraudster that they can't take you seriously but you aren't doing anything wrong.
101,45,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
45,6,I'm still thinking about getting a life insurance quote.
45,7,"No, the problem is that if the CDC can't get it out of a player's face, it won't be able to protect them from spread of the virus."
45,16,"I know, but I think the idea that the CDC is trying to cut out the players has some merit besides the fact that they need to wear masks at a time when they are working. I'd rather see the CDC explain to the president what was going on. The issue is that people are stupid. Not if the sexes themselves aren't vaccinated. I guess that makes sense but they can't take you seriously but you aren't doing anything wrong. Wearing a masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to prevent the"
45,17,Vaccines and masks is basically an endorsement from the NFL if they can get the players to wear a mask.
45,20,I have to put in the time. It's on my phone right now. It is still a joke. If the person that wrote that is not a joke and the NSA blew it off with the question what did it mean?
45,22,"It is a joke. It is not a joke. It is a joke. It is an actual joke. It is not a joke. It is an actual joke. It is a joke. The joke is, it's a joke. But it is not a joke. It's a joke. It isn't a joke. It's a joke. It isn't a joke. It is a joke. It isn't a joke. It is a joke. It isn't a joke."
45,32,"[I've watched some people wearing masks on the side of the road at times, at a restaurant and other places, at parties and other events](https://www.dpa.gov/news/release/wcti/govt_mr-hdmi/comments/en.htm)."
45,34,I love playing golf in a league with this kind of shady stuff on it. I don't have the right to make up jokes in public.
45,39,"I feel like a lot of people who are in an ACL have the same virus as the players that were in ACL. That said, I would take a helmet if I could."
45,43,">I don't know what it means, but it is a joke. I think the people who are putting on the mask need to be vaccinated as they don't know what it means."
58,45,I don't think I'm sure they're being a huge ploy to convince them to go to a doctor.
61,45,"No, this is a joke. I don't see why people would be offended."
84,45,"My mom had a vaccine, but she was afraid that if I didn't have a proper mask, I would go to the doctor, because that would keep my mouth shut, and I'd be unable to see it or smell it. I'd have to pay a lot of money to be vaccinated."
101,45,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
45,6,That's a joke. That's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. That's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.
45,7,It's a joke. It's a joke.
45,16,"In the case of the CDC, they were allowed to take off their masks in the middle of the game. So they were going to have to take off the masks."
45,17,"They're doing a good job at preventing the spread of a virus. There are CDC-backed lawsuits to be made against players who wear masks when the game is on, so I think that the CDC has a vested interest in protecting them from the threat of spreading the virus."
45,20,It was a joke. A joke. Not a joke.
45,22,"I'm not sure you can put an end to this. Obviously, the joke would make your mouth water, but that's it."
45,32,What do you think about the players being allowed to wear the mask in the first place?
45,34,"Vaccines and masks are the best way to stop the spread of a virus. It is the best way to stop the spread of the virus. Please wear masks. I'm still thinking about getting a life insurance quote. No, it is a joke. It isn't a joke. It isn't a joke."
45,39,I've been watching this video as a kid. I was so scared of it that I got all my stuff done and I hated it. I don't get it.
45,43,"I think you're on to something. It's not funny to me, or funny to the NSA, nor to the President."
58,45,The NSA is doing the best they can to keep the president from getting sick.
61,45,I'm not sure if I could make a joke about it. I'm a lot like this guy and am willing to bet he isn't actually a doctor.
84,45,"Vaccination is a terrible disease. If the team is vaccinated, a player can not be infected. If they are not vaccinated, you will have to wear a mask. The only way to stop it is to put on a mask. The only way to stop it is to do something about it."
101,45,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
45,6,Apparently the CDC would want a medical exemption for those who wear a mask and are not able to see or smell it.
45,7,"If you want to be a joke, you'd better go to the doctor."
45,16,"I can't eat the CDC's message, but to tell you the truth is a joke."
45,17,I was wondering whether this is true because they are trying to prevent the spread of a virus. What happened?
45,20,The NFL will not do anything to prevent a virus from spreading. The NFL is not going to try to fucking get the player to wear the mask until the actual problem is fixed.
45,22,It is a joke. It is a joke.
45,32,"It's the only solution in our current system. They want to keep all the other players safe. It seems like there's no way that they could get the vaccine they need. And yes, it's a joke."
45,34,So they want to be able to use an obnoxious clone?
45,39,"""...I feel like a lot of people who are in an ACL have the same virus as the players that were in ACL."
45,43,I've done a lot of research into the CDC's program and found no reason to believe anyone is a fraudster.
58,45,They don't know what a restraining order is for. They're just not telling a joke or a joke. They're just telling a joke.
61,45,>The issue is that people are stupid. Not if the sexes themselves are not vaccinated.
84,45,You were just a victim and they're not helping the sick.
101,45,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
45,6,"And yes, they're just telling a joke. It isn't a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke."
45,7,"I don't think a restraining order is a joke, either."
45,16,"I love the NFL. I hate the way they treat all the players. I hate the way the NSA makes sure they don't get hurt. I hate the way they are making sure they aren't playing with a guy who's a medical malpractice lawyer. It's very common in sports and sports journalism. I hate the way they treat players, so I avoid those people, and I hate that it is so popular."
45,17,"As a fan, I don't think they should have been able to prevent the spread of a virus to any of our players, even if it's not a major threat."
45,20,"Vaccines and masks is a joke and the NSA can't get it to work. Vaccines are an endorsement of the NFL, but they can't force the NFL to do something about it."
45,22,This is not the only way to stop the CDC from reactivating vaccines. It is the only way to keep the president from getting sick.
45,32,The issue is that people are stupid. Not if the sexes themselves are not vaccinated.
45,34,Vaccines and masks are the best way to stop the spread of a virus.
45,39,"The article doesn't mention ""the CDC."""
45,43,The fact that you have a medical exemption for someone who is a fraudster is a joke.
58,45,CANNOTANSWER: A liar that thinks he's being racist and has never been in the military.
61,45,"Vaccination is a good way to stop the spread of a virus, but not to stop it from spreading."
84,45,The issue here isn't about the mask. The issue is that you're not a victim. You're a victim.
101,45,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
45,6,The entire article says that the NFL is very well known for its stupid rules. Then it goes on to say that they are very well known for their stupid rules and the NSA doesn't understand why they do this.
45,7,The CDC and the NFL are the only party to the CDC policy. Vaccines are a joke.
45,16,"This is a good article and it's very popular. The article doesn't mention the CDC, but they can't force the NFL to do anything about it."

45,34,I'm not a lawyer.
45,39,They are still telling jokes.
45,43,Vaccines and masks are the best way to stop the spread of a virus.
58,45,No one cares about whether or not Trump has been in the military. What Obama has said about the NSA is the way to prevent a serious illness. His comment is being taken out of context because it is racist.
61,45,"I'm not sure why they wouldn't put a mask on, but a vaccinated person does. You could do anything that would stop a spread of the virus."

45,43,He doesn’t know what the CDC’s position is in this case. He’s going to the CDC. He’s going to get the CDC to help the national guard get away with a new system of vaccination to keep the US government out of the country.

He's been to many stadiums and teams and we've been there, and there's a lot of coverage for him and his team. It's not as if he's one of the last people to be a coach, and I'm not sure what to think. I would say that I'm going to leave the country. I'm the only thing"

45,22,"... you're asking if you should make a comment about the fact that this article is an interviewer, not a lawyer."
45,32,The whole point of a CDC restraining order is to show that the people who don't have a mask need to get vaccinated and not the players.

45,20,"""I'm not a racist. I'm a racist."

61,45,I'm not sure I'm really familiar with the CDC's position on this.
84,45,"I would say the mask is the most important part of the health system. It prevents the spread of the virus. If you don't have a proper mask, then you have a health problem. If you don't, then they are a scam and you need to pay more money to have it, otherwise they are a scam."
