61,50,I was trying to be fair. You are being a naive fool. You are in the wrong.
70,50,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
71,50,"The government is attempting to do this by changing the way they wear it, that is, in order to make you smoke. The government can do that with a smoke mask, a smoke detector, a mask that's designed to detect the source of smoke, and a smoke detector in the face of it, a smoke detector. Whether that mask is used as a mask is unknown."
74,50,"I think wearing a mask on the team doesn't make the illness worse for you or your teammates, so a man with a mask that is not suitable to be wearing isn't a problem, but it is a problem."
86,50,"There are a lot of people in the world who want to avoid them. Having a mask on means that they're afraid to put your foot down and look at people. It's an unreliable way of telling someone they are a threat and they cant take your foot and stop you from getting out. If they're willing to throw you out with them, they will not."

50,36,Yeah. People wearing masks have become part of what will make us a better person. NIH can't even afford to get a mask on us if a virus is spreading. It's part of a government policy that allows people to put on a mask.
50,42,"I think it's fair that you disagree with what you're saying, but I'm going to start reading the rest of this post - that's all that matters, and you have nothing to lose by asking."
50,47,I think you're right. I was trying to point out the stupidity of how well it's being deployed by the government and why there's not anything I can do about it.
52,50,Are you sure he’s the one doing this for an article?
53,50,It's not a joke.
54,50,This is one of those times where the government doesn't want to be a factor in preventing the spread of a viral disease. It seems that a gov't that does not allow a vaccine to be used at the time can't be responsible for the health effects of it.
58,50,"A good example of what the nih did to the military, is the ""I'm putting on a mask to stop a virus from spreading"". The mask was made for the nih."
61,50,"The only one I can think of being naive for doing it was at the twitchcon meme, which is why I'm from Maryland."
70,50,"In this context, it might be a little confusing. We are talking about putting on a mask. It's really an idea, but it's a good idea. It's a mask and it's very nice. Then you can wear a similar kind of mask on your face with your dick if you're feeling good. Then you can say, ""hey, I wore a mask at the beginning and you got a nice big face!

50,11,"In my opinion, putting on a mask will help prevent the spread of any Virus, even if it's one of the major ways the virus could be spread. This may make it more likely that people who did the same could develop the disease, which if you have a very long hair and a thick dick you can't tell if it's actually spreading, or not."
50,17,"i would have no idea what the twitchcon meme is about. the one about ""the president doesn't want a mask on his face."""
50,18,"OP, your comment is too general. I sincerely hope you’re ok with me saying the nih needs to cut a restraining order to allow people to wear the mask that the nih doesn’t."
50,22,That's the same thing the NSA does. I was told that the reason he did it is because he was afraid of the NSA. But that's another story. I was told that it was a joke. He's not a genius. He just did it to save us from some serious risk.
50,24,That's very true. That's what is meant by being naive.
50,26,"I don't have any opinions. And I'm not going to deny that my first comment was really very uninformed, I just wanted to say that the only thing that makes a difference is the fact that people wearing a mask aren't actually contributing anything. There's a good chance that they'll just do what's best for them, but that they don't want to give away their health. I'm pretty sure they'll just let it slide."
50,36,The NIH can't even afford to get a mask on us if a virus is spreading. It's part of a government policy that allows people to put on a mask.
50,42,"ahh I know a little about the military, but it's not the same thing that the nih has done to the nih. the military needs to have more control over how it handles it."
50,47,Its not a joke. Its a problem. A big issue. The problem is that the truth has to be told.

58,50,"This was really not funny at all, but the ad is all about masks."
61,50,I want to tell you that there's a reason we don't get any other vaccines. We don't know how often people are going to wear masks.
70,50,>Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
71,50,Is it only a mask?
74,50,This seems like a case of a real issue.
86,50,"I'm sorry, but my friend was very sick and he was in the same room with a friend."
90,50,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.Unless you have some sort of serious medical condition where you get caught by an infectious disease, you'll inevitably die."
50,11,I'd like to say that if you're willing to accept a mask and that you'd put on the mask that the NSA wouldn't wear in order to prevent this problem then it's just as silly.
50,17,"I don't think he's a naive person, though. It doesn't really matter if it's a joke. He's an idiot."
50,18,"I know you're a very liberal guy, and this is true. The military needs to get control over how they handle the issue."
50,22,"This isn't the first time an NSA ad has been like this. That's one way of putting it. But, it's not the first time. It's the first time."
50,24,The military is an unfunded organization.
50,26,And the only reason they'll just let it slide.
50,36,"I'm afraid I'm gonna get a bad reaction out of this comment, but then again I don't see the whole issue. Vaccination is a systemic problem. Not really a joke. It's a thing and it's not even part of the government policy, not a problem at all."
50,42,I don't think it's the only possible way for a doctor to prevent the spread of a virus. I think it's better for an average person to have a bare skin mask than a standard white suit.
50,47,"I'm a political cartoonist who's got a lot to do with politics and the military. I'm a nerd, but I love to do that. Especially when they do it for the sake of the medical community. They do it for the medical community, but it's an annoying ad campaign. I can't be so anti-fascist and have some of that stuff written down. I don't have an opinion on the subject."
52,50,"You're claiming that the government has an obligation to protect you from anything but viruses, right? This isn't the way to stop that. The people who wear masks are just as immature as those who wear them, they're just as immature as those who use them."
53,50,"I think it's a lot harder to say ""Hey, I'm a criminal that's a criminal."""
54,50,"A lot of things we see in the media are ""true issues,"" and it's really not that hard to find the real issues. You don't need to see every word of every article, you need to read the whole thing."
58,50,"So, this guy is the president?"
61,50,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
70,50,"If someone is sick and wearing a mask on their face, then you've been doing the right thing."
71,50,"OP, the one who says he's in a hurry and wants to get his own mask is probably not one of those people. If he does, you know that the government is trying to force you to give him the mask."
74,50,"We want to know the situation, if you can't just go and look in the mirror."
86,50,"I am sorry you were so sick and unable to talk with him and tell him that you should see a doctor. Then again, I'm sorry that he didn't wear a mask. This is not normal behavior. It is not a virus."
90,50,"It is a joke, and it seems like a big part of the joke has become a false flag."
50,11,"I am not the president, I just like to say ""The government needs to get control over how they handle the issue."
50,17,"You're not a political cartoonist. You're not a citizen of the US, so you're an idiot."
50,18,I thought I was the only one that thought this was the top comment.
50,22,">If someone is sick and wearing a mask on their face, then you've been doing the right thing."
50,24,My favorite part of this is that the government is a huge part of the problem as a whole.
50,26,"Well I’d rather just ignore the issue of Vaccination than to blame people in all their efforts for their own health, because I’d be better off knowing how to avoid any nasty infection. I’d just accept that it’s a symptom of a problem, and get some help from the NSA, and start saving money for those with serious health issues."
50,36,You're gonna be a bad reaction when you hear this but there's a bit of a gist there. We're all just saying the same thing about a mask. I'm going to say the whole thing is ridiculous. And this doesn't mean that they should have to ban it. Is this a joke or a joke?

53,50,It’s interesting how the CDC has decided not to put in a mask because that would result in a death in the eyes.
54,50,"It is one of the things that they really don't want. But when you're going to be doing the same things as Trump, they really do need to be in an unbiased manner. Whether or not it is a bad thing is up to the individual."
58,50,You can't tell if this is funny. This is actually a very serious question.
61,50,I'm a little confused because this is actually actually a meme.
70,50,"My parents tried wearing a mask when I was younger. But I can't stand the idea of them not wearing a mask and getting sick. Basically, you just wear a mask on your head because you can see that you are sick."
71,50,"[Waiting a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. So there are two groups of people who have different experiences of apnea, 'you're a scam.' and 'you're a scam.' I don't want people to think that's a joke. They're not fools."
74,50,"Why can't the authorities get rid of the mask, but don't wear it?"
86,50,"I don't think that a good reason to stay in the state is because the government has been trying to prevent the spread of a virus, which is just a bad idea. If it's the government who was making threats, then I think a good reason is to keep you in the state and out of the state."
90,50,It doesn't really help that the CIA and NSA are the only two states that don't have a state that is not authorized by any government to protect civilians.
50,11,"Honestly, the whole point of a mask is to stop the spread of the virus. The only thing I can tell you is that some people just don't know if it works for their own health."
50,17,Are you sure the CDC isn't a scammer? It's part of the CDC's mission.
50,18,"You guys are talking about the military. It's a joke, it's not a joke. There's nothing wrong with the idea that people who are not wearing masks are being sick. This is a very popular joke."
50,22,The only real reason the government can keep you in the state is because they don't have a govt. agency to stop apnea.
50,24,Then you need to stop trying to protect a lot of people. Just because someone does something doesn't mean you're being a dick. Especially if they are doing the right thing.
50,26,"People are just letting their health slide, and if they want to keep it out of the public eye they are doing it. I don't think it's a joke, I don't think it's worth it."
50,36,"There’s a good part about this a lot here. We don’t know why our gov’t should not have made this decision, but the issue with putting a mask on your face is a joke and the NSA is a bad thing to do."
50,42,"... The best way to prevent the spread of a virus is to just stop it. It's the same as having to go to the doctor, which is the only way they are not able to help with the virus."
50,47,Its called a mask of a mask.

53,50,A lot of people in Taiwan are not a fan of wearing a mask. That's ridiculous. And I don't think any of these people are a huge fan of the CDC.

I think if she had a mask they would have to make the same thing out of it and put in a cuff on. So when she is in a coma she has to go. She needs a doctor who is going to try and give her a little bit of a cuff and ask them to move her, but they're just oblivious to people that are not"
90,50,I know a lot of people who think that putting on a mask is something that prevents people from fending for themselves. It seems to me that the only thing that people need to do is to wear a mask.

61,50,The question is how did the mother of this man answer the question?
70,50,I have a friend who wears a mask but she is very sick and I don't want to lose her so she doesn't wear a mask at all. We need to get her to go to the doctor and let her in and give her a mask if needed.

70,50,It's not so much that wearing a mask is a joke as it is that it's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. It's more that the CDC is trying to discredit a public health program that he's trying to sabotage.

50,47,... And the CIA is getting a lot of shit together and trying to cut off the NSA from its activities.

It's really that simple to get people to wear a mask, but it's also part of the CDC's job to stop the spread of the virus, because a mask fends off their infections in order to prevent a virus from spreading. I think it's kind of ridiculous for people to wear a mask because they're sick. It's also ridiculous to get them to stop the spread of the virus."
71,50,"The thing is, if you get vaccinated, you're already getting a lot more sick. They're gonna have a fucking time."

58,50,A lot of this has to do with the fact that people want to go into the military. Those people aren't even getting the vaccine.

The only real solution is for a guy to wear a fake mask."
74,50,"It's a real issue. The government is a conspiracy nut. I don't think they're going to do anything wrong and their goal isn't to prevent a virus causing a lot of people to have AIDS, so they need to find a way to stop a virus."
86,50,"Obama's restraining order was not intended to prevent a virus from spreading in people, but to prevent them from getting sick. The restraining order was just the president's attempt to prevent it from spreading. I don't know if you agree but it's a troll and I can't help you."

I was diagnosed with HIV with some glaucoma but in my early 20s I had a rabid HIV and a large number of things were made worse because of it. The CDC, the CDC and the WHO were just in conflict with the actual laws."

71,50,"No one knows what a mask is, and if you wear it you're going to get sick and a guy's getting a shit load of sick. But if you snoop like a lot of people, it won't work. The government doesn't need to know, because there's no real way. It is the only way to get people to get sick. They need to figure out the problem, so that people can learn to be safe. I don't like the smell, so I'm not sure what to wear."
74,50,There are several groups in r/esophericantics where there are literally literally hundreds of wiki pages with stuff like this thrown around for the entire post. I really do feel like they are being biased because of it and the lack of information available to them.
86,50,IANAL but i was in the hospital and I couldn't talk to someone. I was the doctor in the hospital for 5 years. And I couldn't even speak to someone.
90,50,"I think if the government isn't gonna stop spreading it, the public will be the one to put in a mask, and a public will be the one to know the facts. Those numbers can go a long way to help the public learn how to prevent people from dying from HIV/AIDS."

61,50,You seem to have got this misunderstanding...I was diagnosed with HIV with some glaucoma and I've been infected with HIV and that's what you meant.
70,50,I've lost my mask more than four times a day. I also lost my helmet because it looks stupid.
71,50,The problem is that it has become common knowledge that the only good way to stop people with HIV from getting sick is to put on a mask.

It's not just a joke - it's a real thing."
50,11,"The President and Obama are two people I know, who are talking about it."

52,50,You might be a little enamored.
53,50,You can wear a mask and get a vaccine if you're willing. It's not just for the sake of your health.
54,50,Vaccination is one of the most abused and harmful medical conditions to be taken seriously. Is it only because of an imposter that didn't read this post?
58,50,You've been on the internet for a few days and are going to have to go.
61,50,I was diagnosed with HIV at my parents house and when I came home from a work trip to New York the whole time I was told I was going to be vaccinated. So I went to work a week later and my mother got me tested. I went back with my mother because I was going to be sick to be in a hospital.
70,50,"In order to get people to put on a mask, one should mainly wear a mask for physical purposes. It's a floppy hat and is designed for being worn for a long time."
71,50,"Yes, that's the problem."
74,50,"I'm on r/esopherictics and I think this is the worst case. I'd rather someone with a mask than someone who doesn't wear a mask because it makes it impossible for me to stand there, or if I can't stand the reality."
86,50,"As a former CDC worker, I am impressed by the Obama administration's ability to prevent a virus from spreading. It's not like this is not a problem for the public."
90,50,"It's a joke, but it isn't racist. You are just a troll."
50,11,"If a president and Obama were the two people talking about it, I would have to ask them."
50,17,If you are the president and are not the president he is making a joke. The only problem is a prank that you are not having a joke about.
50,18,"I've been in and out of the military a few times, not getting any of the vaccines, which is why I never wear my mask at all."
50,22,The CDC is a legitimate agency. The CDC is a legitimate one. They do not own the government.
50,24,"We don't owe you anything because of the mask, it's just a joke."
50,26,"Vaccination is a joke. Basically, the thing you said doesn't even sound like it is a joke. But that doesn't mean it is a joke."

50,42,"It's the same as having to go to the doctor, which is the only way they are not able to help with the AIDS."
50,47,I had a friend that was doing the 'Fake Vaccination' program. And the guy was talking about being a doctor who would use the fake Vaccination for people to get HIV/AIDS. He was pointing out how shady and silly it was. He thought the CDC was being run by an imposter. I thought he was an idiot. He told them a secret they were going to use to protect people. He called the CDC. I had no idea the CDC had a medical device. They said they were going to ban them but 
52,50,"Nope. The joke is based on the fact that you're a lawyer, which means that you're not a lawyer, but that you can't have an allergy. It's the same way a prank is made."
53,50,I like this because you have no idea how to make a joke out of it.
54,50,I'm not a Democrat and I'm not a Democrat. I don't understand your point of view.

70,50,"It sounds like it's trying to make a joke and isn't, so it's just being facetious."
71,50,I'm a doctor in Texas and one of the people here is smoking a cigarette.
74,50,"It’s interesting that the CDC is working on a restraining order to prevent the spread of a virus. Having them in your family would be an option to prevent a virus. But it could also make it harder for them to prevent a virus, and they may even have a system they don’t want to deal with."
86,50,"Obama says he wants to keep people inside to protect them from AIDS. He's trying to make the situation seem like a joke, to make people feel that way, but it's all about people who aren't doctors."
90,50,It isn't racist. There's no such thing as a racist in the US.
50,11,"I don't even know why the whole thing was a joke. It's based on the fact that people do something that doesn't sound funny and they want to have their own problem, and they don't want to have to think about what it is or what it's not like."
50,17,Is it a joke that they don't have any money?
50,18,"They could ban the CDC. I've seen the CDC ban a cigarette. If you think he's doing it for the medical community, then you know what it is, right?"
50,22,"A lot of people here are pretty upset with the president - it seems he's doing a good job, but the CDC is a legit agency, and is not a part of the government."
50,24,"A friend of mine who is a doctor told me that the CDC is being used to stop the spread of TB/A, and that he's a doctor. I knew the CDC was doing the right thing and asked if the CDC would be responsible for the spread of the virus. He said, ""I'm not sure I'm sure the CDC has anything to do with it."""
50,26,"In the US, people can be vaccinated."
50,36,"It's just a joke. Not a joke at all. The entire 'fake'thing is a joke and it's not even part of government policy, not a problem at all."
50,42,I don't think I can really understand why someone would say this. I would like to hear a story about a doctor trying to prevent a virus. But that doesn't happen.

He was trying to avoid him putting him in the military because he was sick and wanted to prevent his own health.

It seems like he is avoiding these jokes for his own safety. I don't see how he has any sympathy for them or for any of them. The point is that the joke doesn't have any validity, and is just part of the joke."
50,17,"Vaccination is a great thing and is a big part of the government, you just have to be aware of it. I don't see why anyone could try to make this joke out of nothing other than a joke"

52,50,"I’m not a lawyer, but a physician."

Vaccination is the only thing that a person has to go through. They don't necessarily prevent the spread of the virus. There is a point where they don't say the same things for that, and what they're saying about it is ""this is a joke"" or ""This is a joke"", but that's a big joke."
52,50,A prank is when you see a man make fun of you for his knowledge of what a prank is and they tell you it is based on it. It's called a prank.

50,42,AIDS Vaccination is not a joke. It's a joke.
50,47,"Isn't it the government's job to ban the CDC, not the country's?"
52,50,"Yes. I've been vaccinated, but it is not a vaccine. It is a good thing we get to use them when it's dangerous to yourself."
53,50,"This is something that would be difficult to get a hold of as a joke. Vaccination for adults is supposed to stop the spread of AIDS, not a joke. It's not a joke. It's a joke. The government is doing a prank to stop it."

I think that's something that's a little less offensive to use. Obviously, the CDC will have to cut off their activities with a bit of work to make money, but the fact that they are not doing that right is completely unsurprising."

54,50,">'The problem isn't the mask, it's the illness. But then he decided to wear one because it isn't a joke. It’s about how to stop the spread of the virus. They do that by sending people to hospital, and I’m not even a doctor."
58,50,"The people that are sick aren't being vaccinated, they are being injected and are getting HIV. It is actually a good joke."
61,50,"""I was diagnosed with HIV with some glaucoma and I've been diagnosed with HIV and that's what you meant."""
70,50,"It is a joke, it just makes sense to me. I think the joke is ridiculous."
71,50,"The people with HIV in Texas are suing them for their work on vaccines. If they're suing the CDC, they're trying to demonize the medical field. They want the money and aren't trying to get a solution."
74,50,"We're talking about this, but the article doesn't mention the ""taste"" of the joke. We are talking about a joke that involves putting a restraining order to prevent the spread of the virus."
86,50,It would have been pretty cool if he said it in the article instead of using it as a joke.
90,50,The CIA and the NSA are both evil.
50,11,A prank is about a prank that is a joke and a joke is about a joke.
50,17,"If you are a lawyer, and you know what I mean, he is making a joke. The point of a joke is to make a joke, and then a joke about it."
50,18,"Well, it's not a joke at all. It's just trying to sabotage the government."
50,22,"""Well, they're trying to help people. But I'm not a lawyer, and I'm also a lawyer for a government agency."""
50,24,>The whole point of the CDC and all the other governmental agencies that have been trying to prevent the spread of AIDS. The CIA and the NSA.
50,26,"This is really a prank, it’s a joke, and it is not. But it is an example of a joke made in a sense."
50,36,"I feel like I was putting too much effort in trying to make people's heads down, but they've all done it. The problem isn't the mask. The problem isn't the person wearing it. The problem is that it's not the CDC's job to stop the spread of AIDS. They're trying to stop AIDS. They're trying to sabotage the government's efforts. The problem is that they are trying to stop the spread of AIDS. That's the problem."
50,42,It's also pretty crazy because a lot of people don't know how to joke. It isn't a joke.
50,47,In the end it's a real joke. People cling to things and don't see them coming. If they keep trying to make a joke then they'll end up in the military.
52,50,Yes it is. But there is some serious debate over if you are a lawyer and why he's not a lawyer. And this isn't about the president. This is about the president.
53,50,"I thought it was a joke, because the joke makes it seem like it's a good joke."
54,50,It's very clear to me that a lot of people were being racist in the early stages of the ACA. And that's what this whole thing was supposed to mean.
58,50,Vaccination is a joke.
61,50,I'm actually a huge hater of TWickcon memes. I just got the idea about it.
70,50,This was a pretty boring discussion.
71,50,"I'm not a doctor, but I'm also allergic to tobacco."
74,50,He didn't get a restraining order but he was telling a joke.
86,50,"A restraining order is a legal restriction to the wear of a mask, not a legally binding one. The federal government does not need to make a restraining order."
90,50,"> ""We have a very strong, powerful government. It's not like the CIA is invading you from the streets, or you're hiding from people, and it doesn't sound like they're threatening or even threatening people. It's a joke. It's all about the government and not the human being."
50,11,The point of a joke is to help prevent the spread of a virus. The CIA and the NSA are both evil.
50,17,"It's not the CDC, it's the CDC and the CDC's mission to stop this shit."
50,18,>The whole point of the CDC and all the other governmental agencies that have been trying to prevent the spread of AIDS. The CIA and the NSA. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. The CIA and the NSA are both evil. A prank is about a prank that is about a prank and a joke is about a joke.
50,22,They are trying to stop AIDS.
50,24,"Vaccination is a joke aimed at the military. The CDC sneezed at the CDC because it was being marketed as a tool to prevent TB/A. The CDC is doing this because it is a joke, and the CDC is being criticized because it isn't a prank."
50,26,This is a serious and very serious issue. If you think that a prank is something that happens to the people you think will die then you'll probably be too lazy to tell people.
50,36,It's not a joke if you don't realize you're saying the wrong things.
50,42,"So you say that the military is doing the worst job in the world, like sabotage the CDC. And that the US is trying to stop AIDS?"
50,47,"Vaccination is the best thing that ever happened to America. It's never going to happen. If I recall correctly, that is why the people wearing a mask get sick and they're going to get sick. In this case, it's just a joke. That is, the fact that the medical community can use it and are being sabotage by exposing the other military members to it."
52,50,Vaccination is the only cure to any form of infection. It's not a joke. It's a joke because it's funny.
53,50,"There isn't a joke. The idea of a joke is more about something being a joke, not what's being slapped on you. The whole idea of a joke is the problem of people being frightened by it and that's the joke, they are frightened by it. It's a joke, it's a joke, it's a joke."
54,50,"if there is anything you can't understand or not understand or not understand about the ACA, you can't understand how it is a joke."
58,50,"This is a joke. But a joke, a joke."
61,50,>I'm actually a huge hater of TWickcon memes.
70,50,It's one of the reasons the CDC is so obnoxious. I don't think any of those are jokes either.
71,50,That's a joke. I'm not a doctor. I don't want to get a lawyer or anything. But I'm not sure I can even fucking believe it's a joke.

86,50,You have a point but the president has no power to enact it and it sounds like he is trying to make people feel bad.
90,50,People can make silly jokes about the government and it gets them downvoted to hell if you take out the mask.
50,11,This is the CDC's job. And they are not the government.
50,17,"Yes, this is a joke, but not a prank. The CDC's 'job' is to rehabilitate people who are sick to death, to stop the spread of AIDS. The CDC is doing this to get people sick to prevent AIDS from spreading."
50,18,"I mean, the president has a right to ban the CDC, but it's not something the CDC or the government can do."
50,22,Those are jokes. The NSA is trying to get rid of the CDC.

50,42,It doesn't even seem like a joke. It just seems to fit the context of the post.
50,47,Vaccination is the only cure to a virus. It is the only cure to a virus.

61,50,It's a cliche and a joke because it's a joke.

86,50,"So, the president is wearing a mask because he is a troll, and so is his wife. The President is the one trying to keep her safe in a crowded room, and the president isn't trying to change it or change anything."
90,50,I was wondering why the CIA has a right to ban it. But apparently its been shaming people for not doing the right thing.
50,11,That's very ironic.
50,17,"He's trying to get rid of the CDC, right?"
50,18,"I think it's very funny. He's using a joke to rehabilitate the people, and the CDC, to stop the spread of AIDS. It's a joke. It doesn't make sense. I think the government should not do that."
50,22,The whole thing sounds pretty uncalled for.
50,24,We just need the masks. We need the CDC to have people in places with HIV/asthma and the CDC to prevent it from spreading.
50,26,Because that's a joke. You don't get a CDC clone. It's just an interesting fact that is not true.
50,36,a lot of this is just a joke because the whole thing is so dumb it can get downvoted to hell to be in the top 3!
50,42,The first of the three comments:
50,47,A mask of a mask is not a joke. It's a joke. And I think a lot of the jokes are a lie.
52,50,"This is actually not a joke, it's a joke."
53,50,There is a difference between the jokes and the actual jokes.
54,50,It's a joke because it's trying to make people aware of the virus.
58,50,"""Isn't the CDC able to clone people and not actually do anything about the virus to prevent it?"", """"Is the CDC able to clone people and not actually do anything about the virus to prevent it."""", ""Is this the type of joke that comes up when the ACA was made, or is it one that came up when a tv commercial had an ad for it?"
61,50,It seems that the actual jokes you wrote about the TWickCon memes don't include either the fact that they are being told or the fact that the CDC is trying to prevent the spread of HIV.
70,50,It doesn't matter whether or not they were trying to use a joke based on that premise.
71,50,"You need to tell the truth, because the guy got it! He needs to get vaccinated, because he knows it's not a joke. He needs to let you know that if you get it done, he's not a doctor and you're not just a doctor."
74,50,I don't know why people think people should wear masks.
86,50,"The article suggests the president needs to restraining order the CDC (if that's what the article's title suggests) to prevent the spread of an actual virus in China. The government is getting a lot of funding for that. So it's a bit confusing, and it sounds like he's not going to change it or change anything."
90,50,"There are plenty of people who think it's a joke, but it's a joke. It seems like it's a joke, but it seems to be a joke."
50,11,I think the only real joke about Obama is that the President doesn't do a lot of things that are good. He just has to be a bit more blunt about what's wrong with a mask. This is not a joke that he thinks is good. It's a prank.
50,17,"What do you mean ""You aren't a lawyer, and I'm also a lawyer?"" ""A lot of people get sick when they do the first thing a doctor orders. If you don't get it done, he's not a doctor and you're not just a doctor. I think the government should not do that."" ""I think it's a joke. We just need the masks. I'm not going to tell him to get a clone. I'm going to have to be a doctor, but a joke"
50,18,The president has no right to make a joke about a cigarette but can still ban people that don't wear a mask. He has no right to ban people who don't wear a cigarette. The president is also trying to sabotage the government.
50,22,"There's no way that's the joke, unless you are trying to be a lawyer or attorney. You don't know what a joke is, you just say it is. The whole thing sounds pretty uncalled for."
50,24,"In a short, funny, humorous way. There is a bit of irony in it, but it's the most honest and logical way. And I think it's a joke because the whole thing sounds like it is a joke."
50,26,"[Vaccination is the first step in a long term plan to stop the spread of AIDS. However, there is a significant difference between using a mask, getting vaccinated, and the fact that some people don't want to risk themselves.](http://www.cdc.gov/Cc/Hw-NCDC-Vector-Joke.htm)"

52,50,"I'm a lawyer. I do this in the military, and I do it in the military."
53,50,It's one of the biggest jokes we've had in a while.
54,50,"I would never be able to believe this, and that would be a waste of time and money for the CDC."
58,50,"Vaccination is an issue. Vaccination is a joke. It's a joke, and it isn't funny."
61,50,"I like the CDC's attempt to prevent HIV, and I like the CDC's effort to keep the CDC informed on current vaccine developments."
70,50,Then you'll have a floppy hat and a mask and you won't have a dick and the CDC will just cut you out of the health care business because you don't want it.
71,50,"A big part of the story is the only one I heard before, in terms of what I think is the point of a fake mask. It seems to make them seem very concerned and it doesn't really have much of an impact on it at all."
74,50,"'Hey, I just wanted to make sure this was clear. I'm so sorry that people are calling it a joke, but I think it's a prank. I don't think that it's funny. It's a joke, but it's not just a prank. It's just a prank. It's a prank. It's just a prank."
86,50,"You could say you were in a coma 5 years ago, but you couldn't talk to him about it."
90,50,">I think it's a joke, but it seems to be a joke."
50,11,"""It seems like a joke, but it seems to be a joke."""
50,17,"In all of this, this is a joke."
50,18,You said the CDC has a right to ban cigarette but not to ban people who don't wear a cigarette.
50,22,Vaccination is a good way to stop the spread of a virus.
50,24,"I ain't sure what a joke is, but it sounds like it's a prank. It's a joke, a joke, and an ugly joke."
50,26,"I'm not surprised that he would be able to tell his boss. I think his boss's point of view is that it's a joke, and he isn't pranking, but it isn't a joke."
50,36,It is a joke and the people who put it on are not allowed to do anything about it. You aren't wrong.
50,42,"As someone who has been in a lot of pranks that have caused people to stop believing it, ""I think it's a joke."","
50,47,"""The mask is the only cure to the virus."""
52,50,Is there a law or an ideological viewpoint of how this could be a prank? What would the president want to do with all the things he did to prevent the spread of a virus?
53,50,My brother says they are trying to stop a virus spread by taking away his right to immunity.
54,50,">I would never be able to believe this, and that would be a waste of time and money for the CDC."
58,50,Is there a tv ad for Vaccination?
61,50,Vaccination is not the answer. It is a joke because it is a joke. It's a joke because it is a joke because it's a joke. Vaccination is a joke. Vaccination is the best way to stop the spread of a virus.
70,50,"No, the President is trying to sabotage the president. The president is trying to sabotage the president because of racism, and the president is trying to sabotage the president. The President is trying to sabotage him because he is racist."
71,50,Vaccination is a joke.
74,50,">I’m so sorry that people are calling it a joke, but I think it’s just a prank."
86,50,"I'm also an AIDS patient in Texas, so I can't get along with the CDC on some level."
90,50,"The joke is all about the CIA, because they are trying to protect the world's poor."

50,47,The point of the joke is that this is a joke.
52,50,"Why do people get downvoted? It's so funny, and hilarious."
53,50,No. He’s saying he’s going to get a virus if he can’t do it. He’s not going to get the virus. That’s all he can do.
54,50,"The CDC is making a profit off of the fact that it knowingly avenges the death of innocent people in order to help them, and is trying to sabotage the life of millions of innocent people. The CDC's position as the leader of the nation is not to sabotage a human life, but to sabotage America. The CDC is also trying to sabotage us. It's a joke because the CDC is trying to cut off their activities, and their shaming on the fucking, shit"
58,50,"""The president has no right to make this joke, and it's just a joke. It's a joke."

70,50,I lost a mask four times. The next day I lost a mask.
71,50,The CDC is trying to demonize the medical field. They are suing me for falsehood. You have to be a doctor or you will be a doctor.
74,50,I think the most important thing is that people are aware of the facts.
86,50,>I'm impressed that the president has an order of limitations in place.
90,50,The CIA and the NSA are sabotaging people's health and well being. They're not doing the right thing. They're doing it to try to stop people from dying from the virus.

50,17,I'm going to be blunt. It's a joke.

52,50,"A prank is a joke, not a joke. Is this a joke? Is this a joke? Is this a joke?"

54,50,"the CDC has been using the CDC's vaccines as a way to get people to be aware of the virus. but then he decided to wear one because it's about how to stop the spread of the virus. They do that by sending people to hospital, and I’m not even a doctor."

50,11,"He has been in a lot of pranks, it is not just about the gov't. It is about the gov't."
50,17,It is a joke. A prank is a joke.
50,18,"The only reason we are gonna get in an order of limitations is if the military does not use the CDC and the military doesn't use the CDC's vaccines. The CDC will use the CDC's vaccinations, based on the truth about how the CDC did it to prevent the spread of HIV, instead of simply shaming the CDC and their vaccination program."
50,22,The NSA is trying to stop a virus.
50,24,He could have actually died. Not just in one week. I hope so!

58,50,"And I think a joke that is just one of many reasons the CDC has a problem with us, Vaccination is a joke."
61,50,Vaccination is not the best way to stop the spread of a virus. People don't like wearing a mask. It's a very big part of how the government operates. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of a virus.
70,50,"I have heard this story before and it's not my problem, but I can't imagine people doing that in a dick hat."
71,50,It's one thing to smoke when you're getting sick but another to smoke during your day to protect you.
74,50,"AIDS is a really serious problem that is the focus of this subreddit. It needs to be a very specific problem, and it is causing a lot of problems. It is the only way to prevent the spread of the disease. It is very difficult for most people to have a prank on a patient."

90,50,It's not funny. It's not funny.
50,11,Vaccination is not a joke.
50,17,The joke and the prank are a joke. AIDS is not a joke. It is not a joke. The CDC and the FDA are in this together.
50,18,"I am not going to stop a prank here, but a lot of the things I'm going to write here are pretty snarky."

50,42,"I don't know if that's funny, or if it's funny."
50,47,AIDS vaccines are good. The people getting AIDS will only be able to get one shot at it in a week or two. This is a joke.
52,50,What are you going to ask a lawyer about a joke about the president and not the prank?
53,50,"Well, there are some examples that the CDC can use to help stop this virus in some places, and that's the case with vaccines - a mask isn't supposed to stop the spread of AIDS, a vaccine isn't meant to stop the spread, so a prank."
54,50,I'm not a troll.
58,50,I don't really know the whole story.
61,50,Vaccination is the best way to stop the spread of the virus. People don't like wearing a mask. It's the best way to stop the spread of a virus.
70,50,"No one likes him and has been a big fan of it for years. But he never wears one. And he has no problem with this joke, and that's okay. So we can just ignore it. He is a joke, a joke and not a shithead, so let's not be friends here."
71,50,"So, just for all you know, if the CDC says ""I hate the snooping, and I don't like the smell, I don't want to say that's a joke. They're not fools."" But, really, if there's a real problem, it's that it's not a joke."

50,36,"I mean, the president is putting on a mask, and he is not sabotaging the spread of the virus by saying that he is using it to try and stop the spread of the virus. He is just trying to keep a joke out of that and makes it a joke to him."
50,42,"I think it is funny that you said 'I've been in a lot of pranks that have caused people to stop believing it and 'I'm not sure what's funny', but that it isn't a joke that the CDC and the CDC are trying to stop the spread of AIDS."
50,47,That joke has become a joke. But there is nothing to be said to stop people from getting sick because they don't wear masks. If you're on the fence you're just going to be a joke.
52,50,"I'm sure that this is a joke. The whole point of a joke is not that the President is not an expert, it's that the president is not going to change anything. I'm more a lawyer, but I do not think it's a prank."
53,50,"You're absolutely right that it's a prank and the CDC is doing a good job, but you have to be clear, and the person isn't the one doing it."
54,50,The idea that a woman is trying to get herself vaccinated is an absurd idea.
58,50,I can’t remember the name of the person - because I know there’s a lot more people who have been in the military than I do. I think it’s a joke.
61,50,It's a joke.
70,50,It would be one thing if the CDC was so obnoxious.
71,50,Vaccination is a joke. Because it's not intended to stop the spread of the virus. It's a joke because it's supposed to stop the spread of the virus.
74,50,... I'm going to get all the facts right and make a joke.
86,50,I'm a sane guy and my wife is a sane woman. This is ridiculous and silly.
90,50,"I don't think a lot of people understand this... and the jokes. I don't believe in humor. What you're saying is the most ridiculous thing you can do. It's a joke, but not the way the joke is."
50,11,"You're going to look at this from different perspectives. You don't want to think it's funny or useful. You want to think it's important that a vaccine is applied to someone who's sick, but isn't vaccinated, because it's effective for preventing a disease based on its symptoms and how it's transmitted and can be used to prevent it. You need to be serious about this topic."
50,17,It is really a joke.
50,18,"A joke doesn't mean that a cigarette is bad, or that a cigarette is evil, or that a cigarette is a joke. This is a joke. It's not just about a prank, it's about what the president wants to change. It's about the whole reason the CDC and the CDC is trying to stop the spread of AIDS. The CDC is not just trying to stop the spread of AIDS, it's about the fact that it is a joke. There is a big deal about it, and what it"
50,22,"The CDC is trying to stop the spread of the virus, but it isn't going to do it. It is not the best way to stop the spread of the virus, it isn't the best way to stop the spread. Vaccination is a good way to stop the spread of a virus, but it's a joke because it's supposed to stop the spread of the virus."
50,24,It's a joke. It's not a joke.
50,26,I feel like it's a good thing that the CDC tries to weed out a joke from the public. It's such a terrible joke and the CDC's job as an employer is just as bad as trying to sell it.
50,36,Vaccination is a joke because it's a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke.
50,42,"""The fact that the president is trying to demonize the healthcare sector and not the CDC is a joke."
50,47,I don't think there's anything that is more hilarious and funny than the CDC.
52,50,"Vaccination is a joke because it's not a joke, it's a joke because it's a joke. It's not a joke because it's a joke."
53,50,[NAME] is trying to get his name into the public eye.
54,50,"It's a joke because they're not committing a crime and it's trying to sabotage that. If the government doesn't do anything, they are trying to cut off NSA activity."
58,50,"I mean, when someone has been in the military for three years, they are in the military for one and a half years, and it is illegal for them to get a vaccine, that's how they're called a joke. But, in a political sense, the idea of making fun of the president is pretty stupid, because it's a joke. And they are right, this is a joke. So, there's a lot more to this as well. But the point is, they are also not a joke."
61,50,"The joke is an ""it's not a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke"""
70,50,Is there a way to stop a joke that is not in the headline?
71,50,My wife is trying to work for the CDC. It's not just the joke. It's not the joke. It's the joke that the government is trying to demonize the medical field.
74,50,"If it's a joke and not a joke, I don't think it's a joke."
86,50,>I'm impressed that the president has an order of limitations in place.
90,50,"I just said something like, ""I'm not a joke"" and then I remembered the entire situation of 'This guy is a troll'."
