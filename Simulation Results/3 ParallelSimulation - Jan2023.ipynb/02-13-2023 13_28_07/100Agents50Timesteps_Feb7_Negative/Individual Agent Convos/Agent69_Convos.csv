69,56,I don't think the CDC is doing this because it doesn't help with the spreading of a virus. I would do the same thing.
70,69,Nope. It's just a simple tip. I need to change my mask.
84,69,It’s one of the few things we all have in common - we can have a whole range of things in common - and that’s only because we all want to be with our family or friends.

70,69,"So, how about putting on a mask? It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
84,69,I lost my mask at the age of 14 when I was about 12. Now my parents wear my mask. We go to the gym every day and go to sleep with them. It is so easy to lose a mask that my mom will probably come for the first time if she isn't out in a few weeks.

94,69,"Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of a virus. Please wear masks. I will get them off. Then a couple of days after they come out, I will ask them to change their masks. They're pretty useless as they are.

86,69,"OP was so in the mood that he had to explain the situation to the audience and then asked him why he chose the ""what if"" thing. It was like he was trying to make fun of OP for having a mask. I had just seen him get all yelled at and yelled and said I'd make it and you know what he did. I didn't get it, and he was a little embarrassed.

70,69,I can't think of a single person with a bad reaction to this. Clearly I don't get it. It sounds like the president does. It's not as if the NSA has a problem with what they do with this stuff.
84,69,"I was always going to get my mask off my nose, and then it went off in a puddle of water. I got it off the ground and they just didn't say anything. I was like, ""I've never seen a puddle of water and a bloody nose!"" and then I stumbled out of the shower with no mouth. I didn't want to go back. When they saw me, I said, ""I lost my mask but it was too bad for me,"" and the guy who brought it back in the house."
86,69,"A mask is not acceptable for some people. I am not an expert on masks. I have been to a few hospitals where the president has a few people. A lot of these people are mentally ill (who have been in hospital for more than two decades, so I would not recommend it to anyone), and the government is not allowed to say something like, ""Why can't I wear a mask?"" Or ""Why don't you just keep my nose down and go to the hospital with me?"""
94,69,> I've found there is a special kind of mask that keeps you from touching things that might be infected. It's not worth it. It's a form of mask. I'm a teacher and I'm an adult. I'm learning about how you can make a lifelong sicker player. So if I am in the NFL I will not be there.
95,69,I don't know why people are like that.
69,3,They're actually more dangerous to the public than the football team.
69,26,"The point is not to try and make fun of the person putting on it but to be in the position to talk about it in a nice, calm voice."
69,56,Why not take a helmet off when you can't see a person? You're going to have a blast. You just have to find it at a doctor and then don't ask a guy to wear it.
70,69,It sounds like the President has a problem with what the NSA is doing with this stuff.

69,3,This is just a r/againstthereddit post with some dumb jokes.
69,26,I've seen this guy on r/nfl when he was talking about how he could be an idiot. He just wanted to see if you had a job with the NSA. It's ridiculous.
69,56,A lot of people think that you're funny and not funny. And you have no idea why people like this are so infatuated with their football team.
70,69,I'd be in trouble for not wanting to wear a mask.
84,69,This is a huge part of the reason you were never vaccinated.
86,69,It's hard to explain this without going into a discussion and arguing. I'm going to go back and look at this: a guy in a mask can't even be a victim of a virus. It’s not normal behavior. It is not a virus. It is a virus. The problem here isn’t the mask. It’s the restraining order that she's wearing. It is not a virus. It is a virus.
94,69,"""I'm sorry, but I think it's kinda unfair that players and managers have to make such terrible decisions and that I feel like a bad person because I'm not in the right place. I wish the players would stop doing that to their players. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best thing to ever happen to the NFL, and it doesn't have to be."""
95,69,"I've seen jokes about the government being able to halt the spread of a virus on my personal computer, and it has prompted me to find a new way to handle it."

69,56,"Honestly i think it's a pretty funny joke. The NFL doesn't have much to offer people that they could've been infested with a virus. That's because it's a bit of a joke. The fact that they're a football team makes it seem like they're a jerk, a joke that it is. It's kind of cool that the players would not wear a mask, but they could still get away with something that they wouldn't want to be infested with."
70,69,I'm a fan of the Bush Administration. The President is clearly not the President of this country.
84,69,What was the name of this man who threw a mask on him?
86,69,"It was an easy move, and one that could help her escape."
94,69,You're not going to get vaccinated because your player is going to be infected? You're not going to get vaccinated because your team is going to be infected.
95,69,"[In that one thread, OP said, I have a bit of a reaction to how it made me laugh out loud."
69,3,This isn't funny.
69,26,I think the idea of wearing a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when I get to my table is one of the dumbest things I've done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask.

95,69,You got a bit in the way of a great joke here.
69,3,As long as the guy on his team wasn't infected then they are putting a fucking nut on his back.
69,26,"I'm gonna have to agree with this other person, I think this is a really good one. A lot of people like this are very religious."
69,56,"The fact that they're a football team makes it seem like they're a jerk, a joke that it is."
70,69,It sounds like a lot of white men are infected with the virus.
84,69,No. That's not a scam.

69,56,"This is the craziest thing I've ever heard, a man who threw a mask on him that he thought was funny, and then gave him a bit of a joke that he was doing it in order to get him vaccinated. I just don't see how he would be able to get someone to take them off his back."

94,69,I don't think anyone should ever have to deal with this as it's like a bunch of people that are trying to get sick and being sick.

70,69,It sounds like the president has a problem with what the CIA is doing with this stuff.
84,69,"Yes it is. I don't have a r/health blog and r/affluenza is all about this. We have a r/affluenza/news section on our subreddit that covers the whole issue of ""scammed"" virus infections. That's not the sort of thing people would say."

94,69,Were there any games when you were not vaccinated for a virus? The only thing I can think of is to put on a mask.
95,69,I'm allergic to the sprite all the time.
69,3,So they do something about the people in this sub.
69,26,I think wearing a mask to prevent HIV is a scam.
69,56,The CDC is using the mask because it is used to force the CDC to send a sprite to their patients.
70,69,"Well, it seems like the CDC has had a serious problem with this for a while now. I think it's interesting that the CDC hasn't been doing an outstanding job at controlling the spread of the virus. The president is clearly not the President of this country."
84,69,You know the CDC are not going to allow them to stop the spread of the virus. That is why they are calling the CDC a fraud. They are putting the virus at risk for the government to keep it away from other people in the country.
86,69,>It sounds like the people in the CDC are putting in a lot of work bringing up the health issue and letting them decide what they want.
94,69,"The movie does not provide full information on the disease, but rather tells you the story of a player who was infected a couple years ago. The film doesn't even explain it."

70,69,"Well, in the end the president didn't want to do so. Then he wore the mask because he wasn't a fan of his."
84,69,Vaccinating can't be a problem if there is a way to prevent it. I have a fever that gets a little painful. I do not need a vaccine to prevent it. Especially since it is usually a virus and not a virus.
86,69,"Nope, I haven't seen a lot of the actual details of that. That's not really what we know about the situation, it's more that we know about the current situation and that it isn't as common as it seems, IMO."
94,69,"That's an interesting way of saying it, and the first thing I thought of was the fact that when a reporter in the NFL ''The Devil Wears Masks '' wrote an article where they'd be saying, ""Hey, I'm sorry, but I'm really sorry that this was not an informative article."""
95,69,"OP's joke is that ""he didn't know what a prank was."""
69,3,"He is still going to get an illness so he will need a med, not a mask."

69,56,It's just that the CDC is using a mask to be more important in the prevention of viruses.

86,69,"Yes. I'm not sure what restraining orders actually are, but a restraining order can help a person stay away from something. That's something that can cause them to go to prison. But, I believe that people get sick by doing something they shouldn't even do."
94,69,"My favorite game of the year is when the NFL says, ""Fighters are dangerous because they're dangerously hot, and so are the Packers. We can't do much about it, but it's bad."""
95,69,"I don't think it's a joke, just a joke. The prankster might be allergic to the sprite, but he may be allergic to a virus."
69,3,I wouldn't worry about my wife being sick if I didn't wear a mask. But I think that's a good point.
69,26,"Vaccination against HIV is a scam. But, it is a scam. It's the most ineffective thing you can do. But, there's no real reason why they don't want to do it anymore."
69,56,I'm going to have to write the book. And I'm not joking.
70,69,You guys are a bit sarcastic.
84,69,"Vaccination is important, but people often assume they're suing a govt. for fraudulently spreading HIV and are calling it ""scam."" So, there's not even an issue here."
86,69,I'm gonna be fucking suck it up with my wife.
94,69,I believe that the question will be addressed in a future post. The question is: Why does the government don't do what's right? How can the NFL not do something about it?
95,69,I’m allergic to the sprite all the time.
69,3,"And if a prankster is allergic to sprite, they can't help. The CDC does not want to help - it wants to help - a person, because it's not a right thing to do."
69,26,"If you aren't immune to a virus it isn't a virus, and that's because it's dangerously hot. It is dangerously hot, and so are the Packers."
69,56,I think that a restraining order is a good idea because it allows you to put on your gloves without being a jerk.
70,69,No one is denying it. This is what is happening. He is being racist. The CDC and the CDC are helping to stop HIV/AIDS spread. The Obama administration wants to stop this and he is making a joke.

95,69,"A prankster is a joke when you have a hard time breathing, and you are allergic to the sprite."
69,3,I think the real question here is: Why is the CDC and the CDC helping to stop HIV/AIDS spread?
69,26,The question is: why does the government not do what's right? Because it isn't a right thing to do.
69,56,The CDC can't even do something about it.
70,69,It sounds like he's attempting to make the joke and is merely trying to keep the CDC and the CDC from being used to kill people and stop them from having HIV. And he's not being a racist.
84,69,Is it possible that a doctor who was sick was a scammer and was able to prove that it was true?
86,69,OP has a post in /r/politics
94,69,The best thing to do to stop the spread of a virus is to get vaccinated and get vaccines.

69,26,The CDC can’t even do anything about it. The CDC and the CDC are helping to stop HIV/AIDS spread.
69,56,I believe it's possible that a doctor who was sick was a scammer and was able to prove that it was true.
70,69,I've always thought that the CDC and the CDC were making a joke because a lot of the media wants to get rid of it. It seems like the CDC is taking away the CDC and the CDC from being used to prevent the spread of AIDS. The truth is that it is a joke.
84,69,"Vaccination is important, but is not a joke and is not a scam."
86,69,A restraining order isn't a virus. A restraining order is a restraining order. This is not a virus. It isn't a virus. It is a restraining order. This is a restraining order.
94,69,"A lot of the jokes on here relate to the fact that vaccination is the best way to stop the spread of a virus. The US has no way to prevent diseases. If the players aren't vaccinated, they are probably not vaccinated. If they aren't vaccinated, then they are probably not vaccinated."
95,69,"The thing with a mask is that they let you know that you're allergic to a virus (which you could be) and that the sprite'suggestion' may be made, and that you're allergic to a virus (which would be a joke)"
69,3,Vaccinating against AIDS is a scam.
69,26,The article was written in his voice.
69,56,"It's not a joke, it's a joke."
70,69,You say you are not a racist. It is an important thing to make sure the government is doing a job that is aimed at stopping the spread of AIDS.
84,69,Is the CDC in the United States? They don't want to be in the country that people who are actually infected with HIV to have the chance of getting caught?
86,69,"That's a shit story. There is a lot of stuff out there in this sub that gets downvoted, but I don't care that much for 'what if'. I don't care that the government is trying to protect people, but that's just the way it is. If you don't like a mask, then it might as well be because it makes it so easy to talk about it."
94,69,>What is your favourite book?
95,69,"I’m allergic to a lot of things, but I can’t breathe. I can’t breathe. I can’t breathe. I can’t breathe. I can’t breathe. I can’t breathe. I can’t breathe. I can’t breathe. I can’t breathe. I can’t breathe. I can’t breathe. I can’t breathe. I can’t breathe. I can’t breathe. I can’t breathe. I can’t breathe. I can’t breathe."
69,3,I don’t know if the CDC or the NFA has anything in common.
69,26,"It’s a scam. The idea of wearing a mask isn’t a joke, it’s an idea. It’s a joke."
69,56,I had to read an article about this recently and the CDC was telling me that the best thing that they can do is to be vaccinated and have them remove the mask.
70,69,"The article says the president should wear a mask to protect himself. It's a joke because a lot of people would take the point that ""You're racist."""
84,69,A good man is trying to make a joke about the fact that it's part of our vaccine system. Vaccination is an important part of the health system. The first part is pretty much a joke. Vaccination is a terrible disease.
86,69,I'd like to agree with you.
94,69,You don't want to jokingly talk about a joke you haven't heard yet. Just read this a lot.
95,69,"In this case, I have the impression that if you don't know what a prank is you are allergic to something and don't want to face a reality check. I mean, if you are allergic to something and you want to face an infection and you are allergic to something then you are referring to a prank that isn't a joke. I can understand why you are getting so mad at them, but it would be a joke to have one person have a real problem with what a prank is."
69,3,What's the point of a mask if you're allergic to a virus?
69,26,"He's not being sexist, and the CDC and the CDC are not helping to stop the spread of HIV."
69,56,This is a lot of the jokes on here.
70,69,"I would tell someone that it's really a joke that they are trying to avoid a virus that has spread. I mean, the CDC is doing this to make people aware of the virus and to make people aware of it, but the whole thing is a joke."
84,69,Vaccination is a horrible disease. The first part is pretty much a joke. Vaccination is an important part of the health system.
86,69,"It sounds like the CDC is attempting to control the spread of HIV/AIDS. They have been doing this all the time since the birth of the CDC, and it seems like there are many issues that could be solved with a restraining order."
94,69,"""We have been vaccinated, but i don't think the vaccine has been tested. It's an expensive procedure to administer the vaccine. And i want the vaccine to be used on a daily basis."
95,69,"This is funny. I'm allergic to the sprite all the time, but I'm allergic to sprite all the time."
69,3,"""I can't breathe. I can't breathe. I can't breathe. I can't breathe. I can't breathe. I can't breathe. I can't breathe. I can't breathe. I can't breathe. I can't breathe. I can't breathe. I can't breathe. I can't breathe. I can't breathe. I can't breathe. I can't breathe. I can't breathe. I can't breathe. I can't breathe."
69,26,"It's like saying ""...as I said you've heard the truth, I'm allergic to something. I don't think you're the right person."
69,56,"There's a bunch of things you can do with someone, but no one has ever told you that it's a joke."
70,69,CANNOTANSWER:
84,69,I'm not sure if this is a joke or just a fake. It is the joke and the CDC is the one that has said that if they don't get the word out of the joke it's not the truth. It is simply a joke.
86,69,"[The CDC and many other organizations [Ingraham] were in a state where it is illegal to have a ""fuck a mask, or a restraining order to prevent the spread of a virus? What's that?"
94,69,The only way to stop it is to get vaccinated and get vaccines.
95,69,I don’t get why people are angry at them. I don’t have the answers to these questions.
69,3,I am allergic to spit and you don't know why? The whole shit sucks.
69,26,">""I've seen this guy on r/nfl when he was talking about how he could be an idiot. He just wanted to see if you had a job with the NSA. It's ridiculous."""
69,56,Vaccination is a terrible disease. It sounds like the CDC and the CDC are not helping to stop the spread of a virus.
70,69,"I'm very disappointed in this joke. I'd like to apologize, but I really don't think it's good to tell the truth."
84,69,"In the US the CDC has been saying ""I've never seen a puddle of water and a bloody nose!""..I don't think ""I lost my mask at the age of 14 when I was about 12. Now my parents wear my mask."""
86,69,"That is one thing and an extreme thing, but it is not that they can't make a restraining order. That's the whole point of a restraining order. It's the point of the order."
94,69,I don't think the best way to stop a virus is to get vaccinated and get vaccines.
95,69,"In a joke, you are allergic to anything and it’s a joke."
69,3,CANNOTANSWER:
69,26,"I'd like to chime in, but I don't think that's the case."
69,56,"Were they saying I can't breathe, then I couldn't breathe when I was in a rush."
70,69,"You are very welcome. It's a great way to get people to stop being infected with the virus. It's a joke, but a joke for some people. I mean, you think he's a joke?"
84,69,"If you’re a doctor, you need to get the doctor to do a thorough investigation. It will take quite a bit of research before they get to the point where they can help you. I would be terribly disappointed with you."
86,69,"It is part of the measure deployed by the CDC and the government to help stop the spread of a virus.A symptom, not a disease, and not actually infecting humans. The fact that he's in China seems a little ridiculous, and the CDC is getting a lot of funding for doing it and that's not really what it would be like without a restraining order."
94,69,My favorite game is when the NFL plays a big role in the fight to keep the disease away from the players.
95,69,"The only thing I can't say is ""I think it's funny"". You're referencing the most common joke..."
69,3,I'm not sure what you're trying to say but the whole idea of a joke was actually really funny.
69,26,Vaccination is a scam. A lot of people seem to think that it's a scam.
69,56,"I have a friend who is a coach in the NFL. He's told me that a CDC isn't the only thing that causes a doctor to wear a mask - just a normal hoodie, not a mask - for the purpose of making a prank about a sex drive, which is a lot more interesting than a football team's jokes. So he has a good point here."
70,69,"You're right, it is a joke. It's not a joke. It's a joke because the CDC is using it. It's an important thing to make sure the government is doing a job that is aimed at stopping the spread of AIDS."
84,69,"Vaccination is important. But it's not a joke, and is not a scam."
86,69,"It's a problem in the CDC, not the president. It's a problem in the country."
94,69,Vaccination is the best thing to ever happen to the NFL. It's also the best thing to ever happen to the government.
95,69,I don’t like wearing a mask when I’m allergic to the sprite.
69,3,"The article doesn't say that ''putting on a mask is a scam'', but that there are people who get sick from wearing a mask and get vaccinated, but that the issue isn't ''being an atheist'', so it's not really a joke. It's ''They're actually more dangerous to the public than the NFL team.''' 'If I were a doctor, I wouldn't wear a mask on people with an illness or a medical condition, so I wouldn't"
69,26,That's a pretty good point.
69,56,The worst thing to happen is to get a restraining order.

84,69,It's one of the biggest scams in the US
86,69,"I don't see a reason in which he has to wear a mask, because that is what he does. If he was a CDC volunteer, and he is in the military, he would be in the CDC."
94,69,This is the first time I've heard a government official being a joke about people who are in a position to help prevent the spread of a virus and a joke about the CDC.
95,69,"I'm not allergic to the sprite all the time, and I am allergic to anything - a virus, the sprite, the sprite..."
69,3,"A lot of people seem to think that it's a scam. A lot of people seem to think that it's a scam. It's one of the biggest scams in the US I don't see a reason in which he has to wear a mask, because it's an important thing to make sure the government is doing a job that is aimed at stopping the spread of a virus."
69,26,It's just the most absurd joke on here.
69,56,"Vaccination is a great idea. The CDC is actually getting some funding from the CDC to help prevent AIDS. So if you have a problem with someone not wearing a mask, it might not even have an important role in the fight for AIDS."
70,69,"I think you have a point, and that's where all this joke is coming from. It is a joke, it's about the CDC trying to sabotage the government. The CDC's shit is coming off as funny."
84,69,"Vaccination is an important part of the health system. It is an important part of the health system. The first part is pretty much a joke, and is not a joke."
86,69,Its a restraining order that would prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS. They would have to remove the order at the first sign of being a virus.
94,69,I believe that this is why the government hasn't done anything about it.
95,69,[The first section of the post is a discussion about the difference between a joke and a joke]. Is it strange that he wore a mask because he is allergic to the sprite?
69,3,I don't think it's funny. I just don't think people think a mask is a joke.

84,69,"Well it's an important part of the health system, not a joke. It's not a joke."
86,69,A restraining order isn't a virus. A restraining order isn't a virus. A restraining order is a restraining order that prevents the spread of HIV/AIDS. They would have to remove the order at the first sign of being a virus.
94,69,"I'm not a doctor, but I have been trained in an influenza vaccination program with a great deal of experience. The CDC makes a lot of assumptions about vaccines and vaccine use."
95,69,"I'm allergic to any form of viruses, but not to the virus. I have a hard time breathing."
69,3,>I am allergic to spit and you don't know why?
69,26,This is just a great excuse to have a restraining order.
69,56,I don't want to hear that because the CDC tries to prevent AIDS. I do want to hear that the NFL is taking steps to stop the spread of the virus and making a joke about it. It's probably going to be something that will happen soon.
70,69,"> ', 'You're a bit sarcastic.', '""I think it sounds like the president has a problem with what the CIA is doing with this stuff."","
84,69,"If you can make a joke like that, then you know you need to get a doctor's approval for it."
86,69,I think a restraining order is pretty useful to be able to work with someone with a virus. That's all.
94,69,"'You can get a booster to get a mask with it, but then they will be able to get a booster to get a mask with it.'"
95,69,The sprite in a prank is a joke. It's called a joke because it's based on a joke.

I can't believe there are 2 million wiped out from HIV/AIDS despite the fact that the CDC has made a serious effort to stop it from spread.

84,69,"It sounds like there is a lot of misunderstanding and misunderstanding with all of them. In my opinion, there are a lot of ways to do this that you can only look at the word “joke” or “joke” and be confused by “joke” or “joke” with “joke” or “joke.” The CDC isn’t even allowed to stop the spread of AIDS."
86,69,"I think a restraining order can help someone get out of the situation as quickly as possible, although I wouldn't recommend it if it were illegal to wear a mask on anyone with a virus."
94,69,I don't think anyone should ever have to deal with this as it's like a bunch of people that are trying to get sick and being sick.

And the fact that the CDC is focusing on preventing it and not trying to prevent it is a big issue for Obama and his wife. I know these people haven't actually asked for any of this, but I think the President is on a journey. It's not a joke. It's a joke."
84,69,Vaccination is important. But the point is to make a joke about the fact that it is a joke.
86,69,That's really not a good idea.
94,69,"It sounds like a lot of people are having issues, including people being harmed, being injured or killed. I know that's a bit of a stretch but if you are actually trying to help, that will be a pain and you will need a therapist to help you manage that. It's a lot more work than that."

69,3,I think a lot of people have a hard time getting a proper response to a joke about a virus.
69,26,"The point of a mask is to stop the spread of a virus, no matter how minor or serious it is. The problem is if the fap is actually in your eyes, then I’m sure he was simply trying to make fun of you.’’’"
69,56,the CDC is trying to stop the spread of AIDS.
70,69,"This is a joke. The president is trying to sabotage the government by referring to a new era, which it seems it’s a very new term. The CDC’s policy of stopping HIV/AIDS is very different from what was said. It is ineffective in keeping people from getting HIV/AIDS and the CDC’s policy of trying to stop it."
84,69,That's because I'm a little skeptical about why CDC is suing for fraud in the first place.
86,69,"The first sentence is a little too far in context for what I have written. I read it in detail and it just says the wording a bit of the sentence: ""I would not wear a mask on people with illness or a medical condition (with a virus) so I wouldn't need to be a doctor."""
94,69,"I'd like to add that I don't think anyone should ever have to deal with this as it's like saying """
95,69,"I haven't seen anything of the sort. I don't know the origins of each term, but I don't really know the specifics of what the word is."
69,3,I just can't seem to figure out why people don't feel a connection to the joke.
69,26,">I'm not sure what I'm going to say if this is a joke, but a joke is a joke."
69,56,"I'm the only one here who thinks ""we don't have much to offer people that they could've been infested with a virus."""
70,69,CANNOTANSWER: ''I think it's kind of ridiculous for people to wear a mask to fend off their illnesses in order to stop the spread of a virus.''
84,69,"Then you could say, ""If you’re a doctor, you need to get the doctor to do a thorough investigation. It will take quite a bit of research before they get to the point where they can help you. I would be terribly disappointed with you."
86,69,"""If I were a doctor, I wouldn't wear a mask on people with illness or a medical condition (with a virus) so I wouldn't need to be a doctor. The whole point is to get your life out of that situation as quickly as possible."""
94,69,"I think it's fair to call the football players ""I don't have a real job. If we have no opportunity to do anything to protect them,"" but if they don't, it's fair to say they're all in an era of government. Isn't this a common practice in the NFL?"
95,69,"I know it's a joke, but I don't know what the origins of the word are."
69,3,I am not a lawyer.
69,26,"It is a very sexist joke, based on the term I think it's important to wear a mask on people who have a viral infection. It is very, very similar to saying ""The people who have an infection with a virus are going to have a lot of problems or problems with their bowel movements."""
69,56,"The CDC, for example, is using the CDC's “preventive medicine” approach to prevent people from getting AIDS by infecting people with viruses."
70,69,"I'm going to stop reading the title and let you know that some of those comments and the comments in this post are from the ""CanNOTANSWER"" team (see: [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME]"
84,69,"The CDC has repeatedly lied about being a fraudster and suing the government, but this is just a case of a joke."

94,69,"I don't see why you have to deal with this. This is the first time I've seen a government official talking to a CDC official that actually believes it's a joke and not a fact, but it's a general statement that you think is ""unfair"" and it is not. That means that you can't think of any other good reason for the government to have this attitude. It's as simple as if a doctor who doesn't like to be a public health officer would even be able to understand that the government should have been "
95,69,The first part is a discussion about the differences between a joke and a joke. I don't understand why people are so upset about this.
69,3,I don't think a lot of people have a hard time getting a proper response to a joke.
69,26,The people who are on this team are actually on the football team. There are also some good ones on here as well.
69,56,Vaccination is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
70,69,This is not a joke. CDC is not trying to stop the spread of AIDS. It's a joke because it's the only way to stop the spread. It's not the right thing to do.
84,69,"> I'm not sure what the word ""joke"" means. In my opinion, there are a lot of ways to do this that you can only look at the word “joke” or “joke” and be confused by “joke” or “joke” with “joke” or “joke.”"
86,69,">I thought ''if I were a doctor, I wouldn't wear a mask on people with illness or a medical condition (with a virus) so I wouldn't need to be a doctor. The whole point is to get your life out of that situation as quickly as possible.''"
94,69,"I can't believe the CDC hasn't done anything about it. It's a joke about people claiming that a virus is just ""a joke"" as far as I can tell."
95,69,"Is it a joke? Because, I think I can understand why people are upset because I'm allergic to a virus."
69,3,"I am a doctor, I don't know what the joke means, but I do know that it's not exactly the right thing to do. A CDC official would be putting a mask on a sick person in order to get vaccinated, and that's how it works in the NFL, it's not a scam."
69,26,The CDC is working on that.
69,56,So that's why your comment has a dick.
70,69,I'm very upset about the Obama administration and I'm sure they're both trying to change the AIDS joke to stop the spread of the virus.
84,69,Vaccination isn't a joke. But its the fact that it is an important part of the health system. It is an important part of the health system.
86,69,The CDC is trying to make it legal and it's legal. The CDC can not be legally prohibited from doing things that don't exist because of it.
94,69,"If you go to the football games with your kids, it's going to be a lot harder to make them vaccinated."
95,69,I don’t understand what you mean by a prank. You said that the prank was a joke. It’s a joke.
69,3,I'm allergic to spit.
69,26,">I'm gonna have to agree with this other person, I think this is a really good one. A lot of people seem to think that wearing a mask to fend off their illnesses in order to stop the spread of a virus. Vaccinating against HIV is a scam."", ""The article was written in his voice."
69,56,It's an absurd joke. The CDC is the only agency that has a prank involving the health care of their own patients.
70,69,"I'd like to say I feel like it's ridiculous for people to wear a mask to fend off their illnesses in order to stop the spread of AIDS."""
84,69,It's not a joke. It's a joke that's not a joke.
86,69,A restraining order is not legally binding. A restraining order isn't legally binding. A restraining order isn't legally binding. A restraining order is a restraining order. A restraining order isn't legally binding.
94,69,">When I am not coaching, I am also not vaccinated."
95,69,"I was a little allergic to something in my nose, but I am a little allergic to that sprite and it makes it uncomfortable and I can’t breathe. My nasal passage is not good because it makes me regress."
69,3,Vaccinating against HIV is a scam. Vaccinating against HIV is an important part of the health system.

He's a politician, and I don't know why he's not actually telling me."", ""I've seen this guy on r/nfl when he was talking about how he could be an idiot. He just wanted to see if you had a job with the NSA."", ""I don't think that's the right thing to do."", ""I'm gonna have to agree with this other person, I don't know what the joke means"""
69,56,Vaccination is not a joke. It's a joke. The CDC and the CDC are trying to stop the spread of HIV.
70,69,CANNOTANSWER is a doctor at the University of Illinois. I have no idea why the president is being so obnoxious.
84,69,What the fuck is a joke? A joke or a joke?

94,69,I do not know if that's true - but I can tell you that we can not have a better understanding of how viruses are transmitted in the NFL or what vaccines are used in the game. It's important to make sure that the people we have on the field are being trained to use them.
