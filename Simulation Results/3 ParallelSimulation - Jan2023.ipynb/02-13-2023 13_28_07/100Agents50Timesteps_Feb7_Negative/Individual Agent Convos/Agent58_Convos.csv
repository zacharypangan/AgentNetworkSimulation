73,58,i love coaching however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops
76,58,putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i ve ever done in my entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things
77,58,I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam.
80,58,i love coaching however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops

58,3,"There's also a bit of a joke called ""Napsters. "" You know, the ""Hippy"" part. You're supposed to wear a mask to help keep you out of the way, and there are a lot of other things you can do."
58,14,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
58,16,Trump and Ingraham are destroying all our rights and promoting a culture where it's a common practice. Ingraham is taking advantage of it.
58,19,This is a good one. You are out there with them. They don't like masks. They have no rights and they haven't even talked to them about it.
58,21,"There's a book about them. Do the people not think it's ok to wear a mask? If so, they are wrong."
58,22,"OP, I'm a little annoyed that the government is so obnoxious with their policy on putting on masks."
58,33,"""We cant be the one to see it if we don't wear the mask.. You can't be the one to see it"""
58,36,"Then you'll be the one who's blaming the president for everything. And, you know, what the fuck was the president's response?"
58,38,"Thats the morality of that piece of legislation. The other thing is, that's not the right way to do that. If she was ok, and we didn't get a deal, the first thing she did was fuck the president for saying it, but now it's just like a trick."
58,42,You can tell this is what the law is saying by the way.
58,45,That's a good one.
58,47,I like the idea of that.
58,48,"So basically the answer is : No. Trump said it's ok not to wear mask, and Ingraham said it's restricting our rights to keep us locked inside! You know our right to die and infect (kill) others. Why isn't Ms. Ingraham out there with them."
58,50,"I mean, there's a few of us here, so what do you mean by ""Trump said it's ok not to wear mask, and Ingraham said it's restricting our rights to keep us locked inside! You know our right to die and infect (kill) others. Why isn't Ms. Ingraham out there with them."
58,51,"Yes, and it's ok to wear a mask, but I don't think she is a legitimate doctor."
58,55,"As a former RN and veteran of the RN program, this is how I came to learn that the NIH had a policy of prohibiting people from wearing a mask in the event they were attacked by a virus."
58,57,You are making a huge statement that putting on a mask is the only way to prevent the spread of a virus. Is this true?
73,58,I have been wearing a mask for about 7 years now. I am sorry
76,58,That's a very interesting thing to say to me.
77,58,I lost my mask when I was a teenager. I would make fun of the people who I was with.
80,58,I don't know what else I can do but we aren't sure what a good deal of the government in our country would do if we weren't able to wear masks for the duration of the game.
91,58,I am so sorry that happened.
58,3,There's no way to stop them from wearing masks. I think they are just not a good idea. It's really not like a good idea.
58,14,I think the NSA is a good thing.
58,16,"It's the same problem as the Obama's ""Pence of Perpetuity"" rule."
58,19,"Using a mask doesn't stop a virus from spreading. The President doesn't even realize how great a virus can be. He doesn't realize that the government doesn't want us to have that virus. He sees a chance to stop it and can do so, and he's done it."
58,21,"That’s what I’m thinking, OP. I’m not sure what you mean by that. This isn’t a news article..."
58,22,It's not ok to wear a mask. You are making a huge statement that putting on a mask is the only way to prevent the spread of a virus.
58,33,"In the end, I think the best option here is to take a look at how to protect yourself from a virus."
58,36,"OP, I'm a little annoyed that the government is so obnoxious with their policy on putting on masks."
58,38,"I don't know what other people here understand. You are a little annoyed that the government is so obnoxious with their policy on putting on masks. ""We cant be the one to see it if we don't wear the mask.. You can't be the one to see it"" Then you'll be the one who's blaming the president for everything. Then you'll be the one who's blaming the president for everything. If she was ok, the other thing is, her choice on what a policy"
58,42,"So basically the answer is : No. Trump said it's ok not to wear mask, and Ingraham said it's restricting our rights to keep us locked inside! You know our right to die and infect (kill) others. Why isn't Ms. Ingraham out there with them."
58,45,It's the only way to prevent the spread of a virus.
58,47,You could still wear a mask for about 7 years. Is there any point in going to an NIH clinic to ask for this to end? If you would like to know the best way to do it.
58,48,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.Trump and Ingraham are destroying all our rights and promoting a culture where it's a common practice.
58,50,"I'm not sure where I get this, but the NIH's policy on putting on masks is also a joke that people who have already been in a position of power or knowledge to do so would be forced to leave."
58,51,"> As a former RN and veteran of the RN program, this is how I came to learn that the NIH had a policy of prohibiting people from wearing a mask in the event they were attacked by a virus. You are making a huge statement that putting on a mask is the only way to prevent the spread of a virus. Is this true?"
58,55,"Yes, that is why we are still using a mask."
58,57,"This was my question, but I don't think it was correct."
73,58,Vaccinating against the virus is the best way to prevent this. Please wear masks.
76,58,"Well, you've probably done a lot of dumb things to say to me. I feel like this is a good thing, and you seem to have done a lot of dumb things."
77,58,"I would like to point out that the Obama administration used the use of the name ""immigrant gov"" to avoid spreading a virus in a bunch of people."
80,58,"This is what you're trying to say, in the article, to avoid. [Even if this is what your goal is, the coach is the one to do it. They need to know their role in preventing this from happening, so they can decide on what to do.](http://www.edward.edward.edward.edward.edward.edward.edward.edward.edward.edward.edward.edward.edward.edwards.edwards"
91,58,"Unless you're playing football in a club with no sassy coach on the other hand, then putting on a mask is an incredibly dangerous and unnecessary tactic, as you'd be surprised if people would get away with it."
58,3,"If you want to protect yourself, a prankster is not a good idea. Putting on a mask is a crime and a very bad idea."
58,14,It's a joke. They want people to know the best way to do it.
58,16,"Well, the biggest issue is that the NIH has no policy on putting on masks and doesn't want to give the players a choice between a mask and a shield to stop the spread of a virus."
58,19,"It's not a policy that's being promoted to stop them from spreading a virus, it's a policy that will be enforced in the next few years by the government."
58,21,"You have never actually been in a position of power. If you have been the President's ally in the past, then your decision to end the policy based on the last one is a blaming move. If you are currently the President, then you are on your own."
58,22,I feel like they're making some pretty stupid and offensive statements. It's probably just a way of saying that in the US there is a very specific role to play for the health and safety of our people.
58,33,It's not even an issue. I'm a RN and a current doctor if you have a question on the subject.
58,36,This is the way we're talking about this... The NSA and the government are doing this in a way that makes them sound bad.
58,38,"You fucked up. I can't imagine what the Obama administration is doing. I see a lot of people in there who might think that putting on a mask would stop the spread of the virus. So the fact that she's not wearing a mask, or maybe not actually trying to get the president out of there a way to prevent it is a little funny, but if you really think the government is a good candidate to get that away with, let's just look at the fact that they're not a good candidate."
58,42,>Is there any point in going to an NIH clinic to ask for this to end?
58,45,"I'd prefer not to wear a mask, but I'm sure I can help with your questions about your question."
58,47,"...but I don't think that the people of this world are going to care about her... unless you're playing football in a club with no sassy coach on the other hand, then putting on a mask is an incredibly dangerous and unnecessary tactic, as you'd be surprised if people would get away with it."
58,48,"The fact that the president is actually putting on a mask is not an excuse to be out in public. The president, not himself, isn't a racist. It's not his right to prevent it, and it is not his right to protect us from the world."
58,50,"A good example of what the nih did to the military, is the ""I'm putting on a mask to stop a virus from spreading"". The mask was made for the nih."
58,51,You are using a mask.
58,55,I think that is a bad thing. It isn't that the policy on putting on a mask is obnoxious.
58,57,"""It's the same problem as the Obama's ""Pence of Perpetuity"" rule. Using a mask doesn't stop a virus. He doesn't realize that the government doesn't want us to have that virus. He sees a chance to stop it and can do so, and he's done it."
73,58,"This was really not funny at all, but the ad is all about masks. I can't speak for other players, I can't talk about the players themselves. I have never seen the problem with a mask. I don't think it is worth it to go to the doctor to test for a virus but I think a mask can help prevent the problem. I think there is more to this as well, but if you're not going to go to a doctor and get tested it is an issue."
76,58,I can't find any more information about what the government is doing to stop the spread of a virus.
77,58,"I've never heard of this, and I don't think I've heard of any other person that did this."
80,58,That is a restraining order. I just can't stand that kind of guy.
91,58,I'm not a good athlete and I don't like wearing masks as a sport.
58,3,Obama has a problem with putting on a mask. It can be a great way to show off his strength and influence.
58,14,"We don't even have a rule about it being a bad thing, it's just the way it is. It isn't going to work in the next few years."
58,16,"That's probably why it's not funny. Until now, you've been making it sound like you've been trying to get an answer to the question of who wants to be president. You don't need to see the president for any more than a brief moment to find out if he is trying to get rid of the president's mask."
58,19,>I'm a RN and a current doctor if you have a question on this subject.
58,21,"And then, by saying this, you mean it was Trump's decision, not the people who made the decision. The truth is that it's a bad idea."
58,22,I think you're being sarcastic.
58,33,"I'm not sure where you're coming from, but this is how I think it is, especially when it's a topic that's incredibly important. The NSA is using some stupid, offensive statements against the US."
58,36,"The first thing I thought of after reading this post was if someone in the White House was a little upset about the president's attitude toward the administration's treatment of the military, but I was very upset for the guy who put on a mask."
58,38,I do not know why you're being downvoted to hell but you're right that putting on a mask is offensive and that it doesn't stop the spread of the virus. There is a very big problem with that. And I think there is something to be said for a reason. I'm sure many people here have a good understanding of why they think the president is being obnoxious and offensive.
58,42,I don't know what they're trying to say but they're doing it with a false dichotomy. That's why the President put on the mask to prevent the spread of a virus. It's an effective way of saying that the president is a racist.
58,45,I don't really think the mask issue has anything to do with the NSA or the CIA. What are they doing?
58,47,"If they are gonna make the president and Congress do this... I think it's probably too late. If you are going to get a restraining order based on their comments about it, the NSA can't even take it seriously."
58,48,"There are many ways in which that can be applied. One is being able to wear a mask on a saturday, while another is wearing a mask on a saturday. That way you can actually tell how dangerous it is and where the virus might be infecting other people."
58,50,"This was really not funny at all, but the ad is all about masks."
58,51,"...but I think if you really think the government is a good candidate to get that away with, let's just look at the fact that they're not a good candidate."
58,55,"The thing about having an irrational assumption about the President's actions is that, for all the good of us, he has to be out of office."
58,57,I don't like the Obama thing.
73,58,"You've been wearing a mask for about 7 years now. I am sorry', 'Vaccinating against the virus is the best way to prevent this. Please wear masks."
76,58," This is the worst thing I've heard in years. There's no reason to believe in anything and to want to go back to the government. This is the dreadful thing to do, that's for sure."
77,58,">They're not saying it's OK to not wear a mask, but it's pretty naive that people do. That's not a good thing, but the real thing is that you need to do the same thing."
80,58,"I don't like talking to a doctor, but I think he should know to go to the doctor and get vaccinated. This isn't a bad way to stop the spread of a virus."
91,58,"I'm not even mad that this isn't an actual thread about it. I'm just talking about the amount of people a government official doesn't care about, because they're saying they think it's a joke."
58,3,People wear masks to shit on the CIA.
58,14,It was really the best thing I've heard in years.
58,16,We're supposed to be talking about all the people who wear masks to help prevent the spread of viruses.
58,19,"It's been a while since I've ever been around the government so that doesn't mean I can't understand the rationale. The government is basically threatening everyone in the country by evicting every one of them. The best way to do that is to find a job, not go to the office and say no to anyone."
58,21,"The first thing I thought of after reading this post was if someone in the White House was a little upset about the president's attitude toward the administration's treatment of the military, but I was very upset for the guy who put on a mask."
58,22,"If you think it's a good idea to wear a mask, you need to get vaccinated."
58,33,"It's not the mask, but the way the NSA's using it."
58,36,It is a bad idea.
58,38,">That's probably why it's not funny. Until now, you've been making it sound like you've been trying to get an answer to the question of who wants to be president.

58,45,It's also funny how the NSA is doing the best they can to keep the president from getting sick.
58,47,"The president is the worst, but not the only one."
58,48,">But I think if you really think the government is a good candidate to get that away with, let's just look at the fact that they're not a good candidate."
58,50,"So, this guy is the president?"
58,51,"That was really not funny at all. I'm just talking about the amount of people a government official doesn't care about, because they're saying they think it's a joke."
58,55,This isn't a joke at all. It's a joke and is offensive. And it's offensive because of its offensive and offensive meaning.
58,57,"So, the NSA is using this as a joke. What's the point of it?"
73,58,"That's really funny. You can't say 'this was really not funny at all, but the ad is all about masks. I can't speak for other players, I can't talk about the players themselves. I have never seen the problem with a mask. I don't think it is worth it to go to the doctor to test for a virus but I think a mask can help prevent the problem. I think it's fair that they are bringing a shitload of people into this discussion because they're not a big deal,"
76,58,Wearing a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i've ever done in my entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things.
77,58,You just read something. You didn't read it and were a little confused.
80,58,"Is the post being deleted because of the word ""failures""?"
91,58,I don't think anyone's ever been vaccinated by the government. Not a government official.
58,3,Obama wears a mask to protect himself and the military. It is a joke and a bad idea.
58,14,The NSA is using a joke to stop the spread of viruses.
58,16,"[NAME] is one of my favorite politicians, and I don't even think it's funny."
58,19,I think it's time to go get some good health care.
58,21,"That's a really good question. I'd rather see the white house explain to the president what was going on at that time. That it's not funny, or that the people aren't funny. What is the issue?"
58,22,He's not the president.
58,33,"Reuters did a a nice work for Obama, and they found an article that made the NSA use masks to avoid outbreaks and he said it is not an issue."
58,36,The only thing that makes a joke is that the NSA is trying to put on a mask.
58,38,"I think a very simple question should be if you are willing to get vaccinated if you believe the masks are really not as effective as you claim to think and how the NSA is manipulating you to make it seem like it's a joke and if you haven't had that answer before then, how would you feel if you didn't see them?"
58,42,Because a hat is the worst.
58,45,"This is what sucks. I don't know what it means, but it is a joke. I think the people who are putting on the mask need to be vaccinated as they don't know what it means."
58,47,"'Hey, you don't have to wear a mask to stay at home unless you're really sick, 'because I do not want you to be in a position to take your kids to the doctor'"
58,48,"It's not the mask, it's the virus. If the President wants to get rid of the mask, then it's a joke. If you think it's funny, it's not the mask. It's not the mask."
58,50,You can't tell if this is funny. This is actually a very serious question.
58,51,>We're supposed to be talking about all the people who wear masks to help stop the spread of a virus.
58,55,They should not have to give out an ad saying anything offensive about Obama.
58,57,"""As a presidential candidate, it makes no sense for me to put on a mask. I just want to have him gone."""
73,58,"> I think it's fair that they are bringing a shitload of people into this discussion because they're not a big deal, So in my case, it's just that we're talking about ""the problem is that I am actually doing it with a mask.

77,58,a fucking dick
80,58,Vaccination is a good way to prevent the spread of the virus.
91,58,>The article said he had a lot of rules about wearing the mask to stop the spread of a virus.

58,19,I was an RN and a current doctor. But I feel the need to talk to a doctor about this.

58,22,So what the other guy said?
58,33,That is why there are masks and the Obama administration has a record of use.

58,47,Vaccination is a good way to prevent the spread of the virus.
58,48,I think you should check out The Guardian by Jeremiah Ketchum's series.
58,50,Ingraham and the NSA are actually a joke.
58,51,The first paragraph was a bad choice for me. I think this person should be in the medical community. A lot of people do not want to talk about the virus. A fucking dick Vaccination is a good way to prevent the spread of the virus. A lot of people do not want to talk about the virus.
58,55,"This is very true. That's the real thing, right?"

58,3,"I think the fucking huffington post is misleading. The president is on a plane with the president's family and is on the plane, but he's on a plane, and he is the president and he's talking with him, saying something like ""That was a joke"" and saying it's a joke and a bad idea."
58,14,I would have liked to talk to a doctor before I gave him any advice on it.
58,16,I'd rather see the white house explain to the president what was going on at that time.
58,19,Is there a good reason to go get vaccinated?
58,21,"I think the real thing is that this is a joke, that the White House is trying to get rid of the president's mask."
58,22,No one has said it. I thought that was a good thing and a bad thing but the guy is saying the other guy didn't mean it.
58,33,It's actually a very important issue to the president because the world will only get worse without her vaccinating himself. It's very important to the president that he has vaccinated himself and his daughters since the 70s.
58,36,"I mean, I don't know why it's funny. I think the entire point of the post is to justify why he is putting on the mask."
58,38,This is so sexist. I don't understand what's going on.

58,48,"A lot of people don't want to talk about the virus. If you're not vaccinated, you will have to put on a mask. The only way to stop it is to put on a mask so you can be vaccinated. The whole thing is BS. In the movie, the woman is putting on a mask. This is a good thing, not a good thing. Vaccination is a good way to prevent the spread of the virus."
58,50,"What is the NSA going to do, and does that mean that the people who wear the mask are unable to be vaccinated?"
58,51,He's one of those people who have the disease and know how to prevent it. He doesn't want to talk about it. He wants it to be about the best thing to happen.
58,55,"""What do you mean that's not a big deal? I think I'm bringing a shit load of people into this discussion because they're not a big deal."""
58,57,He was a joke. And that he wanted to shut down the government. Then he opted for the 'Pence of Perpetuity' rule.

76,58,It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. It's not normal behavior. The restraining order is a bit too harsh for. The problem here isn't the mask. It's the restraining order that she's wearing. It is not a virus. It is a virus. You need a doctor. If she can't see his face it's time to remove it.... and we have already learned that that is something and I want to do. This isn't a

So, the putting on of a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of a virus. It's called a mask."
58,3,I have been with the White House for almost three years. It seems like this post has been made up a little bit to make it a little more interesting.
58,14,I'm guessing that the CDC is using the same joke to keep the govt protected.

58,38,"It's not that hard to explain how a virus can spread across your body, so you have to put on a mask in order to be vaccinated."
58,42,The president wants to continue to be involved with the government. The CIA has done nothing to prevent or contain it. They are trying to do that by putting on a mask.
58,45,The NSA is doing the best they can to keep the president from getting sick.
58,47,The real question is what should the president wear? That the person has the right to be protected?
58,48,Because I am a sexist guy and it's not a great idea.
58,50,"A good example of what the nih did to the military, is the ""I'm putting on a mask to stop a virus from spreading"". The mask was made for the nih."
58,51,I believe it is part of a national program to protect the health of minors and people with a vaccinated face.
58,55,This is why the white house is trying to get rid of the president's mask.
58,57,"The question of the 'Pence of Perpetuity' rule is whether this is a real thing or not, and whether it is a ploy or not to evade the rule. It is a really bad idea."
73,58,It is a joke. It is not a joke.
76,58,This isn't a normal thing. It's a virus. You need a doctor. If she can't see his face it's time to remove it. Unless you want to get a vaccine you need to get tested. That's a good thing. But the other thing I think is important is that there are a lot of people out there who are not immune to getting sick and dying. Wearing a mask can't save you. It's not a good thing. I know what the restraining order is for.
77,58,"I figured I'd point out that the Obama administration used the name ""immigrant gov"" to avoid spreading a virus in a bunch of people."

91,58,"Vaccination isn't a joke. Vaccination is the only thing that is really shady, or any more controversial, in this country. And for a reason, the US is also the only country where anyone can take a vaccination and be a doctor."
58,3,The President's mask is a joke that has a very different meaning.
58,14,"It doesn't matter what is said or done, I have to admit, the question is really, really important."
58,16,"I think it's important that the president is not involved with the military, as he isn't an official member of the military. If he was, the president would not be required to wear a mask - it's probably the most important thing in his life."
58,19,"Ingraham's mother is also a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, citing the fact that a number of other people contacted her about her restraining order, which is very different from the one on her face."

58,42,It's not that we don't have the same rights as the rest of the world. We're supposed to be safer at home. It's not as if the US was one of the last countries to start protecting immigrants. But that doesn't stop the CDC from recognizing their responsibility to keep people from getting sick and dying.
58,45,They don't know what a restraining order is for. They're just not telling a joke or a joke. They're just telling a joke.
58,47,I can't imagine what they'd say if Obama had made a joke about his facial mask?
58,48,Is the President a racist?
58,50,"As someone who is a democrat and has been in the military for nearly three years, I would be concerned about that."
58,51,"""Well, I don't think they're all just being sexist. Why don't they just get rid of them?"""
58,55,No one is saying that a virus is the reason for removing a mask.
58,57,What is the CDC going to do about that?
73,58,I agree with the other commenters:
76,58,"""The first paragraph is a bad choice for me. I think this person should be in the medical community. A lot of people do not want to talk about the virus."""
77,58,I lost a mask when I was 13 because I didn't know the word at all.
80,58,> The CDC is a good place to start. They have a lot of information that they need to know how to handle it.
91,58,He's just trying to make a joke about the fact that it is so bad for the environment that it's infected people.
58,3,"As someone who is a democrat and has been with the White House for nearly three years, I would be concerned about that."
58,14,"I have an infected friend and he is just as unwise as I am. The problem is that the US has a lot of ills, the US does not have a lot of infected people, etc. and it is a bad thing to have a person and family that are actually infected, and it is not ok to have them."
58,16,I was able to put on a mask to prevent the spread of a virus and not see that because the president doesn't know what a restraining order is for.
58,19,They're trying to prevent spread of a virus. It's called a mask. The real question is what should the president wear? That the person has the right to be protected? Because I am a sexist guy and it's not a great idea.
58,21,I don't know what I mean by that. They aren't funny at all. They are a joke.
58,22,The CDC has a lot of information about the virus. They have a lot of information that they need to know how to handle it.
58,33,Obama is a terrible person. And his name is John McCain.
58,36,The post makes a little bit more sense to me. I have had to be a military member in my entire life and to go to the doctors in the midst of a virus infection.
58,38,"If it's funny, then the CDC should be able to go after a problem."
58,42,>The real question is what should the president wear? That the person has the right to be protected? Because I am a sexist guy and it's not a great idea. Obama is a terrible person. And his name is John McCain.
58,45,CANNOTANSWER: A liar that thinks he's being racist and has never been in the military.
58,47,The government isn't helping with the spread of a virus. This is a problem for them.
58,48,"I'm sorry, but that's really not the reason for a mask. It's a mask. It's actually not the reason he doesn't wear one."
58,50,We're not going to have the CDC do something like that.
58,51,> I'm putting on a mask to stop the spread of a virus. It's called a mask. The real question is what should the president wear?
58,55,"There is a bit of a red flag about this, and I think that Obama's role in a virulent vaccine, or at least part of the vaccine, is to remove some parts of his face from the health care system."
58,57,A good place to start. They have a lot of information that they need to know how to handle it. He's just trying to make a joke about the fact that it is so bad for the environment that it's infected people.
73,58,"I'm not a big fan of ''Coaches are always a bad thing to hate'' but when I was a teacher and coach I'd take my kids to the doctor to find out what I'm talking about, and what they say. And they'd get on with the day."

91,58,"Vaccination is the only thing that is really shady, or any more controversial, in this country. And for a reason, the US is also the only country where anyone can take a vaccination and be a doctor."
58,3,You may be wondering why Obama is putting on a mask to prevent a virus. He's wearing a mask to protect himself and the military. His mask is a joke.
58,14,I'm confused about whether it was a joke or a joke?
58,16,I can't believe the CDC hasn't been talking about the Obama Vaccination.
58,19,"It seems that if the government has an effective restraining order on it it's unlikely it will end up like that. Then it's kind of the same thing. But Obama isn't a good president and the CDC isn't an effective policy. He has a mask, but not the right one."
58,21,"I mean I'd rather hear the president explain to a politician that is trying to end Obama's anti-vaccine policy rather than his wife, who was also in the military."
58,22,It was just an interesting fact.
58,33,It is hard to think of any other president who is in the US unless one is willing to go into the military or an elitist.
58,36,I think this is a good idea. He's just trying to be funny.
58,38,I was able to put on a mask and not see it because I was able to put on a mask. It's called a mask. The real question is what should the president wear? Because I am a sexist guy and it's not a great idea.
58,42,That's ridiculous. He could have got into jail and served.
58,45,No one cares about whether or not Trump has been in the military. What Obama has said about the NSA is the way to prevent a serious illness. His comment is being taken out of context because it is racist.
58,47,And this is the guy that has the idea that a mask is too dangerous to wear and needs to be vaccinated.
58,48,The problem with these people is that it is one of the few things that will make a person sick and is often a reason to be sick.
58,50,"Obama's role is to prevent the spread of a virus. Vaccination is the only thing that is really shady, or any more controversial, in this country. And for a reason, the US is also the only country where anyone can take a vaccination and be a doctor."

I don't think I'm even the first to see a child get vaccinated for a bad virus. Vaccination isn't a joke, but it's a joke. Vaccination is a joke. I think it's a joke, and its a joke."

I can’t imagine not getting to be sick, I can’t imagine getting to be sick for a year and a half and I can’t have a face mask for my kids unless I want to be in my vaccinated room. It's not a joke, it’s a joke."
58,48,I have a few things to offer.
58,50,A lot of this has to do with the fact that people want to go into the military. Those people aren't even getting the vaccine.

73,58,"I'm from Texas, and I hate the notion that vaccination is not a joke. The whole thing is BS."
76,58,"Vaccinated people are a baffling group of scumbags. What did the president say about a doctor in the Obama administration? They can make people fuck up the act, and even then they will just not know what the problem is."

91,58,"I've never read a comment where they're saying that people can't take vaccines at any point in their lives, and are not vaccinated, only that they don't want to. It's like saying the first paragraph is the first paragraph of the second paragraph."
58,3,I can't think of a joke that would be better than a restraining order stating that Obama is just a tad unpopular.
58,14,I am not sure if I can get the CDC to make me wear a mask in order to protect me from the virus.

58,21,"So this isn't a good joke, just something that would be interesting to watch for the long run?"
58,22,"What is the name of the person who did the NSA, I've heard about?"
58,33,That's not a joke.
58,36,Is there anything the president and the US government should be doing to prevent a virus from spreading? I don't see how this has anything to do with the CDC putting on a mask.
58,38,The NSA is making a joke about the Vaccine.
58,42,"In the US, it's illegal to put on a mask for some of the most dangerous people. But they cannot have a right to a vaccination, and it's illegal to carry it in public places. So you have to be a dick to not even be able to use it unless you have to be a dick if you have a problem."

58,51,There are a few things that need to be investigated.
58,55,"> ""This is pretty much a commentary on the fact that it's a joke. The President and the CDC are being used as a ploy to stop the spread of viruses. The CDC isn't a joke."
58,57,"I just want you to know that I'm a very liberal person and a racist. I don't like the idea of being able to support the president of the United States in any way, but when someone has already done their job I have to say something along the lines of:"
73,58,"I agree with you on this point, but I can't think of one comment where it isn't a joke."
76,58,The government is implementing a restraining order that explains that people are infected and then put on a mask to avoid infection.
77,58,"So, if I were Obama I would have written a paper containing information that could be used to find me a virus. You should start with the name of the company that makes the movie and then you need to get a second opinion."
80,58,It seems like they're taking it so seriously in the first place. It's a joke. It doesn't seem like they're trying to force people to wear masks.
91,58,"Aaaand here you are, it's been like a decade for me."
58,3,I was wondering why this was being made up in the first place.
58,14,The issue with vaccination is that it's too expensive for us. There are a few problems with the vaccine being so expensive that it's a good idea to wear a mask.
58,16,"What do you mean ""Fuck the president""?"
58,19,Obama did not tell people he was a joke - that he lied - that he is not a joke - that the CDC is the only authority that can do what it's supposed to do to keep the govt safe.
58,21,"No, but I still disagree with the point you're making."
58,22,A bit of everything in this post.
58,33,"Is there a joke? Because they have an online news outlet, the government does not want to keep people safe."
58,36,"""I feel like the CDC is putting on a mask for the sake of the vaccine, which is a joke."""
58,38,Why do people think that the Obama administration is trying to stop the spread of the virus?
58,42,It's a joke. You do not like the president.
58,45,I would rather he could have an abortion
58,47,"No, they aren't. 'Vaccination is the only thing that is shady, or any more controversial, in this country.'"
58,48,The fact that the CDC and the NSA are trying to stop the spread of viruses is a pretty gross sexist joke. I think they are trying to stop the spread of viruses. But it's a joke. The CDC and NSA are trying to stop the spread of the virus.
58,50,"As the article says: [A good example of what the nih did to the military, is the ""I'm putting on a mask to stop a virus from spreading"". The mask was made for the nih.', 'So, this guy is the president?', 'So, this guy is the president?', 'So, this guy is the president?', 'So, this guy is the president?', ""You can't tell if this is funny.', 'What is the nih"
58,51,"Vaccination is a joke. The CDC, the CDC, the FBI and the US Department of Homeland Security have to do what they think is best to keep the government safe."
58,55,"That's not an argument, that's a joke."
58,57,The joke is a joke.
73,58,Vaccination is a joke.
76,58,Is a restraining order an evil one?
77,58,"I've got a point. I don't know how to say something like that, but I don't know how to make a statement like that. I've learned that if I lose my mask at least four times a day, I'm getting rid of it, so be it."
80,58,"It seems like there is a lot of misunderstanding here. I'm going to say something blatantly inane here. I think the first comment I read was to point out that people aren't allowed to wear masks, but if someone wants to go to the doctor and get vaccinated they have to ask their doctor. They don't a person can say anything."
91,58,I think there's a lot of overlap here between the two. It's not that the CDC is not a joke.
58,3,"[The President's mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.What do you mean ""Fuck the president""? Obama did not tell people he was a joke - that he lied - that he is not a joke - that the CDC is the only authority that can do what it's supposed to do to keep the govt safe."
58,14,"No, not all of that."
58,16,You aren't wrong that wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
58,19,He also doesn't need to wear a mask to fight a virus. He needs to just talk to him about it and ask him for it. He doesn't have to talk about it to them.
58,21,"I'd rather see the white house explain to the president what was going on at that time. ""I'm sorry, but I'm affff Wearing a mask to stop the spread of a virus. The truth is that vaccination is a joke. The CDC, the CDC, the FBI and the US Department of Homeland Security have to do what they think is best to keep the government safe. That's not an argument, that's a joke."""
58,22,Vaccination is a joke. They are trying to stop the spread of the virus.
58,33,"And yet, you keep being attacked by a joke."
58,36,"You've made a pretty good point - the NSA isn't shaming Obama, it's defending his policies and what he's doing isn't going to help him get his shit together, but it's doing its job of bringing people back to their homes and getting people vaccinated. I'm gonna give you some examples:"
58,38,They’re making it seem like they are bringing a lot of people into the discussion. Why are people in there who don’t want to talk about it?
58,42,The whole thing is BS.
58,45,"The president has to put the mask on at least four times a day to get the vaccine, and in the course of time he will want a restraining order on the mask. The guy that says it’s ok to wear a mask and goes to the doctor with him?"
58,47,"We've got to stop our governments from taking on the responsibility for the spread of the virus. It's not funny, but it's still not a joke."
58,48,It's a joke. It's a joke.
58,50,There isn't a specific reason for them to do so.
58,51,"It was the whole point of a joke, that the CDC was able to help prevent the spread of a virus."
58,55,He's the most dangerous person in the world. He could be alive.
58,57,I'm trying to be lucid.
73,58,"It's funny how people get ad hominem in the NFL, especially when their team is playing in it."
76,58,A concussion is a virus. A concussion is a virus. A concussion is a virus. A concussion is a virus.
77,58,I read this in the voice of John Stump.
80,58,"I'd be a little too much of a doctor to not want to go to the doctor and get vaccinated, but this is a joke."
91,58,I like that they say a mask that they wear for a day and you want to wear it to avoid the virus causing the virus to spread. This kind of joke is a joke but is shady.
58,3,"I'm not a liberal, I'm a liberal."
58,14,"I don't like the NSA's jokes, but I also don't like the fact that they want to prevent spreading a disease through a mask. If I was an American citizen I would just go to the doctor - it's a joke."
58,16,"The president's role in this isn't to help with the virus, it's to stifle the spread. If Obama wants to fight the disease, then he has to protect himself by not playing for them, because he doesn't want to kill everyone in the world, a virus, and a mask."
58,19,A sexist hat isn't just a joke if it's a joke. A concussion is a virus. A concussion is a virus. A concussion is a virus. A concussion is a virus. A concussion is a virus.
58,21,"Vaccination is the best way to stop the spread of a virus. The CDC, the CDC, the FBI and the US Department of Homeland Security have to do what they think is best to keep the government safe. That's not an argument, that's a joke."
58,22,"Vaccination is a joke. They are trying to stop the spread of the virus. The truth is that vaccination is a joke. They are trying to stop the spread of the virus. And yet, you keep being attacked by a joke."
58,33,The joke is a joke - you can't tell me which part of the joke was in the first place.
58,36,"As of the beginning of this paragraph, the government is an institution that is trying to prevent a virus from spreading. The President is not allowed to give out vaccines to other people in the United States, or to give any of the health care workers in their country the opportunity to get their treatment, which will take some effort."
58,38,"I really think it is a very good idea to make the president wear a mask. And to make a point, in terms of the health of the patient, it's a very good idea."
58,42,"The first part of this is about the president who needs to talk to the president about 'the virus' and ""why the shit isn't going to end."""
58,45,That's a lot of things.
58,47,I’m actually not aware of any of this... The guy is making it seem like he’s bringing a lot of people into the discussion. 'His hat is on the face of the government.’’
58,48,"Vaccination is a joke. They are trying to stop the spread of viruses. And yet, you keep being attacked by a joke."
58,50,I was talking about the Obama and McCain policy a few days ago.
58,51,"The president wears a mask because he thinks it's going to work. That's not a joke, that's a joke."
58,55,This is a real joke. The president has no right to make this nonsense. It's just a joke. It's a joke.
58,57,"I read this in the voice of John Stump. I'd be a little too much of a doctor to not want to go to the doctor and get vaccinated, but this kind of joke is a joke but is shady."
73,58,Vaccination is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.It's not a joke.

80,58,Vaccination is a good way to prevent the spread of HIV.
91,58,The article explains that he was not infected and was being vaccinated.
58,3,It sounds like Obama is using his face to hide the fact that it was not a joke and that the guy is putting on the mask to protect the government.
58,14,I'm actually pretty sure that this guy is not from his own country and has a restraining order. This isn't a joke. It's a joke. This is a joke. This is a joke.
58,16,What happened to the players who got infected by HIV? Is this what was going on when the players were vaccinated?
58,19,Is that what a concussion is?
58,21,It's really funny that this is the best way to stop the spread of a virus.
58,22,This is why Obama is a president. You cannot tell me his name without mentioning it. It's pretty funny.
58,33,"I'm going to tell you this, but that it is the government's job to prevent the spread of a virus."
58,36,The President has no right to be shaming. That is a joke. It is a joke. That is a joke.
58,38,It's a joke - it's not a joke. It's not a joke. It's a joke. The joke is a joke.
58,42,This is a very good story - and you've got it.
58,45,"""The NSA is doing the best they can to keep the president from getting sick."""
58,47,That's a very nice phrase. It's funny that you're still laughing at it.
58,48,"The joke, ""The truth is that vaccination is a good way to prevent the spread of the virus. The truth is that vaccination is a good way to prevent the spread of HIV. The article explains that he was not infected and was being vaccinated."
58,50,Vaccination is a joke. The president has no right to make this nonsense. It's just a joke.
58,51,This isn't a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.
58,55,“He’s the most dangerous person in the world. He could be alive.”
58,57,[He doesn't want to stop the spread of a virus. ''It's ok not to wear a mask.''
73,58,My husband used to work at an ad agency in New Orleans. He was very surprised to find out when the first letter was from a reporter. I was surprised he didn't have the ad in the first place.
76,58,"I don't think I see that coming, but I'll tell you this a few times. I don't believe that someone with the restraining order should be allowed to talk about it, but I'm aware of it."
77,58,"""I lost my mask when I was a teenager. I would make fun of the people who I was with."
80,58,"I think the only thing I don't understand is how the article is supposed to refer to the government's use of vaccines, rather than the CDC, but how you describe it that's a joke."
91,58,"I'm a professional health care provider and I use to wear my mask to protect my health. In fact I have a tv, but my tv doesn't look like a tv. I don't even think my wife can see how this is a joke, so I don't like it."
58,3,A good joke is a bad one if they are using a very obvious and acclaimous name. Especially with the same thing.
58,14,I'm just curious as to how much time there is to be between these types of things and how much time there is actually left for them.
58,16,That's funny and that's why it's not funny.
58,19,The first sentence is incredibly appropriate. I think the fact that the article is going to be changed is a little misleading.
58,21,"I mean the whole thing he said is a joke and it's a joke. But really, do you know what a joke is?"
58,22,"""Making a mask is a slap in the face to prevent the spread of the virus."""
58,33,"The government should do what it can to protect people, and they should if they have a legitimate excuse to go as far as trying to keep people safe. I don't like the term ""joke."" I feel bad that a lot of people get confused, they are being clingy and have a hard time explaining this to me. Basically, they were talking about how Obama is a terrible person, and he's going to get the joke he's trying to make. I wouldn't think that it's just a joke to justify it."
58,36,"I am not sure if I should be laughing or taking offense, because this is a joke."
58,38,"I'm a former nurse at an OHP, and my wife was able to wear a mask during her hospital stay to prevent her from getting sick."
58,42,"As an American who is also very aware of the dangers of HIV, it was one of the first things I thought of when I read about it - it was a joke that he would not be wearing a mask. There is a reason it is considered racist and it is illegal to put on a mask for the most dangerous people - that's what it is."
58,45,I don't think there is any basis in the article.
58,47,"You're saying that it is a joke, but you're being completely overreacting. The Obama administration is not really responsible for preventing spread of the virus."
58,48,It's a joke. The only problem is that it's a joke. The truth is that vaccination is a good way to prevent the spread of HIV. The article explains that he was not infected and was being vaccinated.
58,50,"I've got this: ""The president has no right to make this nonsense. It's just a joke. This is a very good story."
58,51,The NSA is doing a good job of preventing the spread of the virus. Vaccination is a joke. The president has no right to make this nonsense.
58,55,"Vaccination is a joke, and it is a joke."
58,57,I’ve been on the CIA team of 20.
73,58,I don't think it's a joke. Vaccination is a joke because it is a joke.
76,58,"Yes it is. If you wear a mask, you're a troll. That doesn't make you an apathetic racist. Vaccination is the only way to stop the spread of a virus."
77,58,"I mean, I'd have to say that this is one of the least embarrassing, fucking funny, and most heartbreaking, or even funny."
80,58,“‘This is a joke’ is not a joke. They’re using the government to stop the spread of a virus.

58,3,"It's not that the CIA should protect themselves or the president, but that it should help prevent and retaliate against people who are infected, because it's a really good way to stop the spread of the virus."

58,33,It is not a joke. It is not an actual joke.
58,36,I had a smear attack on my phone during a flight to South Korea. Several months later it was a terrorist attack. I was getting fucked by a virus and told that he was the first person to see him in person. I was blown away.
58,38,I don't really care for the president. Just because he is racist doesn't mean he isn't a racist. And he's just being a racist.
58,42,I'm gonna be a clingy troll and say that they're'moming' each other.
58,45,The first sentence is incredibly appropriate.
58,47,I like the idea of that.
58,48,"It's a joke. I think a joke is just a joke. If you think that's a joke, then it's a joke."
58,50,Why doesn't Obama just go into the nih to help people die?
58,51,So you've got to agree with the joke?
58,55,I'm not sure I understand why you think he's going to be out of office. It's a joke because he says the truth is that vaccines are good for the population and that it can't help prevent spread of a virus. He is a joke because he is being used in an attempt to stop it.
58,57,"I'm very interested to know why the CIA is able to clone people and not actually do anything about the virus to prevent it from spreading. This isn't really the article about the vaccination but rather the ""Making a mask is a joke."""
73,58,The idea that the ACA is a joke is a pretty common misconception.
76,58,"The restraining order that states ""They are implementing a restraining order isn't a virus. They can only protect their family and other infected people."
77,58,"The CDC has no mandates for public exposure to the public, and if people aren't aware of what their masks can or can't do, they're not aware of it."
80,58,"Yes, the joke was supposed to imply that ""The article is a joke"" and I don't think that is a joke. Rather than implying that it was in any way an actual joke, it was a joke."
91,58,"You need to stop reading a lot of articles that seem so vaguely funny. There is a point, but the CDC should have some good ones:"
58,3,The CDC isn't the CDC. They are the one that has a mandate for the government to do what they are supposed to do to protect people who are infected. So it's a joke.

73,58,I'm a teacher and I've always hated the idea that vaccination is a joke. Vaccination is a joke. The truth is that vaccination is a joke.
76,58,"> I think this is a very, very interesting topic. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of a virus. Please wear masks."
77,58,"It's a scam. Having said that, there is no legitimate reason for the president to act like a shaman. The reason the NSA isn't in power is because it's making the government look like a scumbag."
80,58,It's a joke. I'm a doctor and this is a joke because it is so unpopular that I can't stand the CDC's actions and stance.
91,58,This has come up a few times in the past - it's the only one that is actually relevant.
58,3,"That's a lot of shit, but it makes sense - 'obama is wearing a mask to protect himself and the military.'"
58,14,I'm a doctor who's never gotten a restraining order from an NSA agent and was able to get into his position by trying to use that joke. I've always seen a joke before the NSA.

58,22,>He is the one who made a joke about vaccination.
58,33,"The joke is that in order to keep people safe, people must wear masks. In fact, the president has to wear a mask to prevent HIV transmission. He must wear it a lot more often than he can and that's the joke. He has no business telling people about the shaming of the govt to stop the virus and to make them seem worse and less evil."
58,36,"Because the President isn't really putting on a mask, he is trying to prevent it."
58,38,What they say isn't funny.
58,42,"There's a difference between saying this is a joke and the ""Obama is the president we need to protect."" This is the kind of joke that makes us uncomfortable, but it also makes us uncomfortable because the US has no such policy against vaccination and no other healthcare system."
58,45,"It's a joke. I'm going to take a trip to the White House next month to learn more about it and see how a lot of people are being misled. I'm not a doctor, but I see a lot of people."
58,47,"As a physician, I feel the need to remind you that the CDC should be working to get the vaccine wiped out. This would help me more when I was diagnosed with HIV, as the CDC will use the vaccine to clone people so that they are more likely to receive the vaccine. CDC isn't going to be able to keep these clones away from a person who has HIV. Vaccination is a joke. The only reason they are able to spread a virus is because they are making it more likely to get a restraining order"

73,58,I don't think it's a joke. They say the ACA is a joke because they don't want to put it in place. That's pretty ridiculous.
76,58,There's a bunch of comments about these.

91,58,I'm a medical professional.
58,3,This is a lot like the Obama joke of President Bush. The president's mask is being put on by CDC and people will be talking about the CDC and the president.
58,14,"I've been diagnosed with the virus once and it gets worse and worse. I'm not going to lie but I don't think I've ever seen an actual medical issue arise from a situation like that. Vaccination is a joke. I'm going to be honest with you, though, that's my first instinct."

58,33,"""It's not a joke. The government should do what it can to protect people, and they should if they have a legitimate excuse to go as far as trying to keep people safe. I don't think it's a joke at all."
58,36,The government does not like making it obvious it's going to have to take action. The guy who got it is only going to be the first one to do it.
58,38,"""Isn't that a joke? I'm not really sure what it's called, but I can say that. It's a joke because it's a joke."""
58,42,I think this is a really good point. You are essentially making a joke.

80,58,"Well, the headline of the article is just a bit misleading. It says that if an individual wants to get vaccinated they have to ask their doctor. That's the joke, the article says that it's a joke."
91,58,"I'm not sure if it's a joke or a joke, but if it's a joke, and it's one that he's trying to troll you about, then he probably means a lot of crap and you're being kind of mean. But for some reason, he trolled you because you were too young to be on the right side of the fence. Despite that he doesn't think he's funny, he thinks it's not funny or controversial."
58,3,The president is a joke that he does not believe the CDC will do anything about the virus because he hasn't got a vaccine and is going to take on the role of a prankster. He has no recollection that he's wearing a mask to protect himself and the CIA and has no idea what a prankster is.

He's making a joke about the CDC, he shouldn't be saying ""Vaccination is the best way to stop the spread of a virus."" he wants to stop the spread of a virus and he doesn't think that's a joke. he isn't a good president, he just wants people to be protected."
58,33,The CDC will be able to prevent the spread of a virus with the CDC's help and the Vaccine Program - which is to say it isn't a joke.
58,36,I think a few things are missing.
58,38,I like the CDC and the CDC. I think the CDC is trying to spread a good joke about the CDC.
58,42,"He is trying to make a joke, that's an asshole thing to say, but not a joke. He is trying to be a joke."

73,58,I'm gonna go out and eat my bananas with you a little more than that
76,58,"Vaccination is only effective against a concussion. They are not immune to the flu. And this is an issue that is not being addressed, I think if the CDC could get a restraining order against the government, he would be a troll."

76,58,"What's the other thing that makes the post even more interesting? You're making the point that if you're not immune to the virus and don't want to talk about it, it is going to make you a troll."
77,58,I've seen this in the past.
80,58,"Vaccination is an effective prevention of the spread of a virus. This isn't a joke, because that's a joke and it's a joke."
91,58,"I don't want to hear this from a doctor, but I don't want to have to go to school."
58,3,This is a very important prank. It's going to be really funny to watch on television.
58,14,A joke is not just a joke. It's just a joke. The president is trying to make the government look bad.
58,16,Ingraham is trying to get the president to put on a mask to stop the spread of a virus. This is a joke because it's racist.
58,19,The article is misleading because you're being a sexist dick. You're being a sexist dick. You're not a racist.
58,21,"There isn't a ""joke"" about the ACA. It's the ""joke"" that is referring to the health care program that prevents people from getting HIV/AIDS in their lifetime. It's the ""joke"" that causes the problem and not the joke."
58,22,"There's nothing 'joke' about vaccination other than saying it's necessary to keep people safe. You're not a joke about it, you are a joke about it. You're a joke about the CDC, not about it. It's not a joke, and it's a joke. It's a joke, but it's not a joke. It's a joke because you don't want to hear it from a doctor, but you want to hear this from the president. The CDC has to do what they think"
58,33,> The only problem with vaccines is that it can be used to prevent the spread of HIV and people who do not have them will get infected without the vaccination.
58,36,The first paragraph makes a little bit more sense to me. I'm a little annoyed that the NSA and the US government are doing this in a way that makes them sound bad.
58,38,"No. ""Vaccination is an effective prevention of the spread of the virus."""
58,42,"It's not just a joke, it's a joke. It's not a joke."
58,45,Vaccination is a joke because it is a joke.

58,48,"I have been vaccinated as a student, and I don't think this is a joke. I think it's the same for every NSA employee in my state."
58,50,Vaccination is a joke. It isn't a joke. It's a joke.
58,51,This joke is very interesting. The most relevant thing is not the joke. It's the joke. The joke doesn't make sense. You are making the joke.
58,55,"No, he hasn't and that's just the point he's trying to make."
58,57,The CDC is trying to make a joke out of the virus.
73,58,"There is no question that 'the truth' is a joke. In this case, we are talking about 'the idea' of a joke. Vaccination isn't a joke, it's a joke."
76,58,I think the article has a few different points to the topic.
77,58,>I've learned that if I lose my mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam.
80,58,I'm a doctor. I'm just saying this.
91,58,I read this in English and found it funny. Its a joke.
58,3,"If the president is wearing a mask to protect himself and the military, it can't be a good joke, especially when comparing a joke to a joke about the Obama administration."
58,14,This has a lot of implications for the CDC and the government.
58,16,The Obama presidency is more than a joke.
58,19,“I was not a good doctor until I got sick. I wasn’t a sick person and I was sick of them.”
58,21,I figured that one was a joke. You're a joke. You're a joke.
58,22,"It's a joke, but it's a joke because you're making a joke about it that a doctor should say."
58,33,"The Obama administration is using some stupid, offensive statements against the government. The Obama administration has a record of use."
58,36,"A good joke is that the Obama shaming isn't only to stop the spread of the virus, it's to prevent it from spreading."
58,38,Vaccination is not a joke because it's a joke. The joke is a joke because it's a joke.
58,42,It's a joke because the president is trying to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS. Vaccination is a joke because it is the best way to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS.
58,45,"Yes, a 'joke' is a joke. 'No' is a joke."
58,47,It's a joke. It's not a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.
58,48,"""President Obama is not going to get rid of the ACA because he is being a racist. It's not his right to prevent it, and it is not his right to protect us from the world."""
58,50,If I were to say that the military is the only country where any person can get vaccinated I'd say the CDC is trying to prevent a virus from spreading.
58,51,"> ""The President is trying to get the president to put on a mask to stop the spread of a virus. The article is misleading because you're being a sexist dick. You're being a sexist dick."
58,55,I don't think the fact that he's a joke about it makes him a joke at all.
58,57,Vaccination is a joke. It's a joke because it's necessary to keep people safe.
73,58,"I don't think the ACA is a joke, but Vaccination is. A joke."
76,58,I think the most important point is that the message of the article is that this person is trying to enrage the people who don't want to discuss this. Its also the reason we are talking about how the president's attempts to turn the government into a troll.
77,58,"The author said the CDC doesn't allow masks, so I'd just make fun of him for doing that."
80,58,I want to help you but the CDC should rethink how it treats this nonsense.
91,58,It sounds like someone made a joke to the CDC about not getting vaccinated in the first place.
58,3,"This is why all of the presidents are shills and racist, and it's why they're raped and killed and hated by other people and hated by politicians and government. The presidents are not only being mocked but attacked because of their apathetic agenda."
58,14,"In this article, it states ""I am trying to save you from the virus virus"" and does not recognize the importance of vaccination because the president seems to be trying to get rid of it."
58,16,"""... And if the president didn't want to be a president, he wouldn't be required to put on a mask. Vaccination is not a joke because it's a joke."
58,19,I've been on all these issues for over 10 years. And this is why we use a lot of humor. Vaccination is very hard to avoid. What we do is sexist.
58,21,"Vaccination is a joke because the President's not able to do it. I don't think that is a joke, but the article points out that the President is trying to get rid of his mask to stop the spread of a virus."
58,22,Vaccination is a joke. It's not a joke because they think it's racist.
58,33,This isn't about the joke. It's about the joke.
58,36,He's also the only guy that has to be around to be vaccinated.
58,38,"The issue is that the President is trying to change how he responds to that joke. In other words, he doesn't listen to anyone."
58,42,Vaccination is a joke. It's not a joke.
58,45,The president is trying to stop the spread of a virus.
58,47,The president's attempts to keep everyone safe are the worst thing that can be done to stop a virus.
58,48,Vaccination is a joke. You fucking have a sex life. Vaccination is a joke because it's a joke. Vaccination is a joke because it's a joke.
58,50,The president doesn't need to know about the virus and wants to tell the president to go vaccinated and get their children vaccinated for vaccination. He's trying to make an excuse.
58,51,"The actual point of the article is that the President is trying to turn the government into a troll. The author said the CDC doesn't allow masks, so I'd just make fun of him for doing that."
58,55,I think Obama is just a sexist dick who is trying to push this idea that people should never be vaccinated.
58,57,"Because of a viral infection is one of the most harmful diseases that has ever been identified, it's a joke and a joke."
73,58,"You aren't a good coach, are you?"
76,58,"The first sentence sounds very unhelpful, but the other part of the sentence is probably a jumbled mess. And that jumbled mess could be anything but, well, incredibly interesting."

58,14,"As a civilian who's never had the virus, I'm not going to agree with the others but I don't think the joke is offensive."
58,16,"I'd think they would be more upset about a joke that I've heard about the president, because I don't think I'd really want to hear a joke about an entire president being in the military."
58,19,"I'd get vaccinated before I got sick, and I wouldn't even wear my mask for fear of making a concussion. But, it's not a joke. I'd just go get some good health care."
58,21,The first one isn't a joke. It's a joke because the president is trying to make it look bad. Vaccination is a joke because it promotes a political agenda.
58,22,There is an article on the CDC that states that a presidential mask will prevent the spread of the virus by not covering your mouth or the mouth. That's an outrageous statement.
58,33,"[(http://www.cdc.gov/resources/medical-complaints/report-obama-report-to_influenza/)](http://www.cdc.gov/resources/medical-complaints/index.php?source=no&reference=obama&reference=0) ""[... In the end, I think the best option here is to take a look at how to protect yourself from the virus."

58,38,Is there anything he did to get it out of the way?
58,42,I have to admit I get a bit uncomfortable with the joke part.
58,45,"As a former president, I want to say that when you say something is racist, it’s not racist. You say it’s racist, and then you say it’s a joke?"
58,47,This is a very funny and funny article. It's about the president and the administration in general.
58,48,I believe this is a citation.

80,58,"In a political context, this joke is not about the government, it's about the CDC."
91,58,It's a joke. It's a joke.
58,3,Is there anything he's trying to say that would be funny?
58,14,This is a joke. The President is trying to make the CDC look bad and it's not a joke. The Obama administration is trying to stop the spread of a virus.

It makes him seem like a bad person for not wanting to talk to the president about the virus, and making the joke about him as if it's a joke about being an atheist.

58,45,The word 'joke' is the reference to a reference to a joke that was in part about the NSA not the president.
58,47,"It's a joke because the president has been threatening to bring the president down. This is a joke because the president is trying to fool the president into acting like it's a joke and making fun of the president to put him in jail, and then putting a joke about the Obama Administration."
58,48,"You know what? In a political context, it's not the ACA."
58,50,"A CDC ad, I believe, does not even mention this in the article."
58,51,The author is a sexist dick. The joke is a joke because it promotes a political agenda.
58,55,"In order to keep the president safe, he needs to be in place with a mask. That will prevent a virus from spreading. The only thing he will not be in office is putting on a mask.

58,22,"The only thing is that the CDC is trying to stop the spread of a virus. And yet, you keep being attacked by a joke."
58,33,CANNOTANSWER: Is a mask part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus?
58,36,I believe the reason is because he's so insecure about the CDC and is not willing to admit it's not a good thing to do.
58,38,"Yes, it is a joke."
58,42,I just learned the fact that Obama is a fucking racist for being gay in the military and for not being an atheist.
