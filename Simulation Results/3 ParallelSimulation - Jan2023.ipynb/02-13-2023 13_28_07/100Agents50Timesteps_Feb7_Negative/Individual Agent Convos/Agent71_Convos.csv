84,71,I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam.
71,6,You've got the right question. Who wears the mask?
71,16,I lost a mask every day. Now that I'm older I really think I'm ready for the next.
71,22,I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam. I'm still terrified of a broken one.
71,26,I lose a mask about 3 times a day. That is the worst.
71,27,I see a picture of a white one on the window.
71,30,I wear a mask all the time. I can't use it for all day and if I get sick I have to work the rest of the day.

71,43,I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam.

71,70,"In the last decade, the government has been experimenting with wearing a mask that makes you smoke and see the leakage. It was called ""Wipe smoke"" - meaning it had a smelly smell and they were able to get a smelly smell on you, making you smoke."
84,71,"I've never worn a mask, but now i'm wearing one :)"
71,6,"I'm not sure about the size but I have a very long hair that I don't like. I know it's a pain to get off the hook but if it doesn't fit, it can suck, especially if it's big enough for your neck to move a little."
71,16,I have never worn a mask. I don't believe that there is anything to be gained from the 'bad' habits of this system.
71,22,"I lost a mask every day and squirm when it's still cold, it's my shit, it's my day. And my shit is just fine."

71,27,It's frightening how dumb they think all of is.
71,30,When I was younger I lost my mask all the time. I thought I was the first person I ever knew who had the virus.
71,32,My husband uses a mask for a few days on a regular basis because he has an allergy to a lot of drugs and they leak it all the time. It's not a bad idea to go outside if you can't even smell it in the air. He just smokes.
71,39,The mask's not as practical as it was supposed to be.
71,43,It's frightening how dumb they think all of is.
71,50,"The government is attempting to do this by changing the way they wear it, that is, in order to make you smoke. The government can do that with a smoke mask, a smoke detector, a mask that's designed to detect the source of smoke, and a smoke detector in the face of it, a smoke detector. Whether that mask is used as a mask is unknown."

71,63,"Unless you are using a mask, I'm sorry."
71,66,"I like the way you think. It's not like you don't know what a ""smoking mask"" looks like. It's a bit of a fake - it's just something that makes you think, not real life, is fake."
71,70,"I'm getting to the end of my speech and then I go and I do it a lot! I don't know if it works, but I do use it a lot and they do this all the time, especially when I'm having a really bad bout of a cold and I have to work all day. I just lose my mask every day. I'm not sure if the leakage is anything that could happen but I know its not a solution. I can't imagine if it would work for so long as I was a smoker."
84,71,You're a scam. You're a scam.
71,6,It's an evil lie to snoop into an innocent people and infect them.
71,16,They don't want to get into you.
71,22,"This is where they really should not be concerned about the leakage. They're going to need a new mask that stops all the symptoms and is a better solution than a shit nose, snot nose, or a nasal spray. And that's just how the government is doing this."
71,26,"I used to wear a mask on a regular basis. It wasn't a problem, it just smelled really bad."
71,27,I'm very sorry for your loss.
71,30,I feel like it’s more like they want people to smoke in the bathroom.
71,32,It's the same for me. I'm a smoker and it's not so bad that it's not a good thing.
71,39,I'm sure there are plenty of people who believe in a mask that smells like nicotine and are able to breathe it in.
71,43,Then you wear the mask.
71,50,I have a very long hair and it's pretty thick. You can see the leaks easily.
71,60,"You know what, when people smoke, they have a coughing apnea that's very hot and has no skin, and the coughing apnea usually happens from the lungs."
71,63,"Honestly, it's almost as if there's something wrong with it. A person's eyes and their eyes and their nose aren't really affected by it."
71,66,I'm gonna get a real mask for this.
71,70,I like the way you think.

71,22,"You're a fraud, so I don't know what to do with this one."
71,26,"I'm not a snooper, but I have my eyes examined for a coughing apnea, and I can tell you that that's not the result of the smoke."
71,27,"I'm a smoker and it's not a problem, but it's a lot of work and you can have a little fun."
71,30,"Aaaand fuck the government. The people who smoke should get a real mask. It's like that ""I've never worn a mask, but now i'm wearing one :)"", ""You're a scam. You're a scam. I like the way you think."
71,32,I'm not sure what they are doing. The government is doing this.

71,60,"So there are two groups of people who have different experiences of apnea, 'you're a scam.' and 'you're a scam.'"

71,6,"""My mom used to smoke a lot and she had to use a mask every day. It was the most useful thing she could get in the world."""
71,16,"A mask that you wore when you got a smoker, was a scummy version of a joke in English."
71,22,"It was just a scam. It's not about the apnea thing a lot of people believe in. It's about the fact that it's the result of adnea, and that's it. The mask is the part that is being used in this context - it's supposed to prevent the spread of a virus."
71,26,I think that you're thinking of a way to treat a cough and apnea while wearing a mask. So this way they don't have to worry about coughing and apnea while wearing a mask.
71,27,Its just a mask. It looks like a cigarette in a picture. I'm not a smoker. I'm a smoker and my mask is the shit. I can barely breathe in a cigarette without it because I am allergic to tobacco. That's a scam. This is a scam.

71,39,What's the point of the fake? A fake? Not a fake.
71,43,"What? No, it's just a mask, it's supposed to mask the way I can't sleep without it, I'm afraid. I'm afraid my breathing isn't affected when I smoke."
71,50,"OP, the one who says he's in a hurry and wants to get his own mask is probably not one of those people. If he does, you know that the government is trying to force you to give him the mask."

71,66,I've seen all of these videos and they're a bit unnecessarily funny but yeah. I don't think they are any worse than others.
71,70,"I've tried wearing a mask before, but it doesn't work. I'm pretty sure it does work with your nose. So that's not a problem."
84,71,I've never seen a story about someone wearing a mask and seeing how it's helping them to stop the spread of the virus. This is the most common scam.
71,6,This is a joke. It's really bad and is very serious and VERY dangerous.
71,16,I don't think it's a scam.
71,22,"I've read that the mask is the very reason people don't like them, they just don't feel like they have to help."
71,26,I'm in the UK so I have a LOT of experience in the industry as well. My wife smoked for me and is extremely sick in the same room as me. I can't breath in the same air or sleep. It's hard enough to breathe in the air and it's so painful I can only see it in a few seconds.
71,27,"I can't help but think that this is very, very funny. I'm not sure why I'm making a joke or I'm not going to believe it."
71,30,"If the government doesn't make a snarky joke about a scam, it's probably that there is some underlying problem with the idea of a mask that people don't really have."
71,32,"I think this is a good thing for you. OP, it is not a scam."
71,39,He is in a hurry.

71,63,I can't believe some people say that this is the one scam they are using.
71,66,I'm not the only one. I've never heard of a person who would be the most fooled by it.
71,70,"A mask has nothing to do with the virus. It's the first thing that I've seen when I was in high school to wear a mask and see how it's helping people with their apnea, and now I have a mask with me because of the smell of smoke. It makes me think it's going to stop it spreading."
84,71,The only thing that is clear is that you are trying to get rid of a virus that is being spread around the world without the government in control.
71,6,This is a joke. OP's not a fool.
71,16,"I'm gonna take some pills now, because of the repercussions. But I want to... It's a fake, a scam, I can't imagine any more than that."
71,22,I'm a smoker and I'm sick and I'm sick of a lot of people. That's why I don't have any other options.
71,26,A cigarette isn't a fake.
71,27,"I'm not sure why people don't believe in fake stuff, just the way some people describe it."
71,30,What you're saying is basically a nonsense. They say it's a joke and I don't think the government is even joking about it.
71,32,It's a scam.
71,39,The point is that the mask doesn't have any purpose. It's just a way of telling people what to believe.
71,43,This is a scam. And what is not a scam?
71,50,He's been a smoker for over 18 years. He has just started a new career in the industry he believes is about helping people with apnea and he has learned his lesson a lot since then. And the government is actually attempting to do it to stop the spread of a virus.
71,60,People who buy fake masks and get a sicke are usually a little trolls.
71,63,Well if the government doesn't make a snarky joke about the idea of a mask then why would they be using it to get rid of the virus?
71,66,This is just the way it is. It's not going to be a snarky joke. It is a very legitimate idea. It is going to be a scam if it isn't in your face.
71,70,"The problem is that people think it's a joke. If it were, it would be a good thing that someone would stop using masks to protect themselves."
84,71,I'm a college football fan. But I always have that mask tucked away in my pocket. :)

71,27,"I'm not a smoker, but my coughing can help prevent it. I'm a smoker. But the problem is I think it's a scam."
71,30,You can say whatever you want and then say whatever you want and that's it. The thing about making jokes is you can't really tell them when you're gonna believe a real joke. You have a pretty strong argument. You've got a weak case but you don't think they're making a joke when they're being snarky. You have a very strong case but the problem is that people don't believe in fake things like this.

71,66,"I thought this was actually a joke because a lot of people were trying to talk about it /r/advocates and it was a joke that was intended to make fun of the joke. They wanted a solution.

71,60,I'm a little sick but my cough and apnea are still pretty bad. I think we're going to have to see a doctor in my case for a week or so. I just have to find another doctor for it.
71,63,Yes. I'm allergic to some tobacco.

71,63,Vaccination is a joke because it's a joke.
71,66,"I would say that if a doctor does not know the facts about the vaccine then a lawyer is going to sue them.

It's really a joke because they are trying to make fun of the joke. They wanted a solution. They're attempting to make fun of the joke."
71,70,Is there any way the CDC can stop this?
84,71,"This is a joke, so I'm making some sense, because I feel like it's a great way to put it. But the fact that it's part of the program itself, so they can get it in place, as an ad hominem, is pretty bad."

71,66,There's no joke here.
71,70,This is a big deal.
84,71,It's pretty obvious that there is not enough evidence for the CDC and NSA to have a legal proceeding. Vaccination is an important part of the health system. It isn't a joke.

71,32,"I think you're missing the point of the joke - if the government has any idea what a joke is, they can make one that actually prevents it from spreading."
71,39,It's a joke because it is a joke.
71,43,Vaccination is a joke because it's effective in preventing the spread of a virus. Vaccination is a joke because it's effective in preventing the spread of a virus.
71,50,Vaccination is a joke.
71,60,"A big part of the story is that the government is being a dick about it. I'm sure there's an interesting conspiracy theory going on here. Vaccination is a terrible disease, but it's still a joke because it's not supposed to work. It's not supposed to stop the spread of the virus. But the government is attempting to make fun of it. It's a joke because it's a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke."
71,63,"""It sounds like there's a lot of work to be done on those masks in a CDC study."""
71,66,"It isn't really a joke, but it is a joke in a sense, because of some sort of insanity problem."
71,70,I think that you're getting a lot of different things here. There are some people out there who really aren't into it.
84,71,"I'm a fan of the CIA and NSA and a lot of people who wear them. I don't know why, but I do know that a lot of people feel it's the biggest scam in the US because it's a big deal. I also understand that he's trying to make a joke about a CIA and NSA and that he's trying to make it a joke."
71,6,The CDC and the NSA are trying to stop the spread of HIV. It isn't really a joke. It is a joke because it isn't supposed to stop it. The CDC and the NSA are trying to prevent it. It is a joke because it isn't supposed to stop the spread of the virus. It isn't a joke because it's not supposed to stop the spread of the virus.
71,16,"I think the joke is a joke because it's a joke that makes people think there is a problem with the US. It's a joke because it's not really a joke, but it's a joke because it's a joke."
71,22,"Vaccination is a joke and a joke. That's how it works, doesn't it?"
71,26,"I don't think you have the right to say that if it's a joke, or because it's a joke, then you should say that's the only real way to stop a disease."
71,27,Because a joke doesn't actually stop the virus from spreading. It's a joke because it works. The government has no intention of making it work.
71,30,The joke isn't a joke at all.
71,32,I think I'm in a joke because of the insanity I'm feeling here.
71,39,"Vaccination is a joke because it is a joke. It is a joke because it is a joke, because it is a joke, because it is a joke."
71,43,"I'm going to make a joke about the government. I mean, you can't really tell what they're doing is that you're a bigot because they know something about it."
71,50,The CDC is trying to demonize the medical field. They are suing me for falsehood. You have to be a doctor or you will be a doctor.
71,60,"As for a joke, I'm not really sure if it has to do with that..."
71,63,"And then the next part: ""So what is this about? Do you feel the need to do a sexy joke?"""
71,66,I'm going to assume you've got all the basic ideas of a joke that I've read in this thread.
71,70,It was the best one I've seen. The best. I just don't know what to do about it.
84,71,A lot of the comments are about how they're being misinformed about something that could have been a scam. Vaccination is not a joke.
71,6,What kind of thing are you describing that the CDC has to do to stop the spread of the virus? It's a joke and it's not.
71,16,"There are several articles that point out that smoking smoke can help protect the public and, to this day, people should be vaccinated."
71,22,>I am a teen with HIV and they are suing me for scams.
71,26,There is a lot of info around here that is worth reading.
71,27,This guy has a big problem with the government and they’re going to sue him for it. They’re trying to stop it. They’re suing him for a scam.
71,30,They are not a joke. It's a joke. They are trying to demonize the medical field. It's not a joke. They are trying to make fun of it.
71,32,It is a joke to make fun of the CDC.
71,39,So...the only really real solution is to make the fake a joke.
71,43,There are so many ridiculous jokes around here.
71,50,"Vaccination is a joke because it's supposed to stop the spread of HIV, but is a joke because it's supposed to stop it. It's supposed to prevent it."
71,60,"Vaccination is a terrible disease, but it is a joke because it's not supposed to stop the spread of the virus. The CDC and NSA are trying to stop the spread of the virus. It is a terrible disease, but it's a joke because it's not supposed to stop the spread of the virus."
71,63,I hate all of this. I hate the whole “I like the sex joke. My boobs can barely see me when I smoke.”
71,66,Vaccination is a joke. Vaccination is a joke. Vaccination is a joke. It's a joke.
71,70,"I would be able to tell you if the mask works or not, but you won't hear it. Hopefully your mom is able to be more sympathetic to the joke, it might actually work."
84,71,I'm in the US and it's illegal to have sex on a baseball team. My friends and I can shave their head with ours.
71,6,I want to thank you for this comment :)
71,16,"I've heard jokes like ""My friend gets me shit and I can't stop talking about it!"" or ""Mom is a shithead, she screams at me and I go to school and go to work because of all the jokes, you just have to get off."""
71,22,“Snoopy’s a joke”. They are trying to prevent the spread of HIV but they’re trying to make fun of the CDC. They’re suing him for scamming.
71,26,"""You gotta be sick of this virus!"""
71,27,"CANNOTANSWER: ""Infection is a disease. It is a terrible disease. It is a terrible disease, but it's not supposed to stop the spread of the virus. It's a joke because it's not supposed to stop the spread of the virus."
71,30,It's also not a joke. It's a joke.
71,32,There are a lot of great jokes that are trying to make a joke.
71,39,What does that have to do with vaccines?
71,43,>I've seen a snooping video of me wearing a fake mask
71,50,It's one thing to smoke when you're getting sick but another to smoke during your day to protect you.
71,60,"""I'm not going to lie, my apnea has become a condition that is the reason why I have my nose and my lungs numb."""
71,63,I like the sex joke. My boobs can barely see me when I smoke.
71,66,"I’m an HIV sufferer in the US. We don’t even have a vaccine. We can’t even have an ebola vaccine. In fact, a lot of people on sex with their nipples don’t have a flu. I’m just sorry."
71,70,"Well, I was just thinking about this:"
84,71,"You seem to have some witty and funny thoughts here, I think. The problem is that the ""the CDC"" is just trying to make people think that it's a joke and not a joke. They're suing people for their own misinformation and misinformation and they're making up a lot of shit on their own as well as any other source they have that does not fall under the normal ""no sex"" tag."
71,6,"I'd tell someone that it's a joke to say, ""A lot of people have had to have sex during their day to protect themselves"""
71,16,"I'm actually a good person. I just can't say how many times I've had to talk to them to help them, and I just can't get any of them to understand them."
71,22,"There’s literally nothing they can do about it. They can’t tell you the reason, you have to get a sex and that’s it. They can’t be fucked or shit. They can’t say if you’re a snoop and you won’t know what you’re talking about. But I doubt that snoopy is really saying it’s a joke and a joke, or if they’re actually trying to make fun of it."
71,26,"It's a joke because it's a joke. I don't want to have to answer questions from a snooper, but it's a joke."
71,27,“It's not a joke because it doesn't actually stop the spread of the virus.”
71,30,You don't know this. The guy is probably snarky. And he does. This isn't a joke. It's a joke.
71,32,"I don't think this is the joke. I've always thought it was about the government. So, what's the joke about the government? Is the CDC just trying to help the CDC keep the virus from spreading?"
71,39,"I don't really get why you think that a joke has to be fake. If you're not willing to risk the death of someone with a virus or a cancer causing illness, don't you want to put a mask on your face and be a real snoop? Vaccination is a joke because it is a joke, not because it is a joke."
71,43,>I like the sex joke
71,50,"So, just for all you know, if the CDC says ""I hate the snooping, and I don't like the smell, I don't want to say that's a joke. They're not fools."" But, really, if there's a real problem, it's that it's not a joke."
71,60,You guys are going to have to go to a doctor. Then they'll get the vaccine.
71,63,"Vaccination is a joke, it isn't just a joke and the CDC is trying to make fun of it."
71,66,“I would say that if a doctor does not know the facts about the vaccine then a lawyer is going to sue them.
71,70,I thought it was a joke to make people think that the masks were actually intended to help a blight on the nation. I'd like to see more of your story.
84,71,"That's like saying something ""I lost my tampon"" or something ""I didn't have a tampon,"" and then ""I didn't have a mask,"" and then just typing it again and reading it again and trying to remember everything."" It sounds like they're all trying to make me feel like this is not a joke, but a joke despite a lot of people trying to make me feel bad, which explains why Vaccination is a big deal."
71,6,"> I don't believe the CDC and the NSA are doing something wrong, which is why snooping is illegal on our borders."
71,16,"You're right, but it's still a joke."
71,22,A lot of the people that are sick of the virus are sick of ebola. This seems to have been something of a scam.
71,26,No snoopy shit like that is a joke. It's a joke. A joke.
71,27,I don't get why people want to do the real thing.
71,30,A doctor is trying to get people to buy a sex mask because he believes he's a fool for having sex with someone he doesn't like. They're trying to make fun of the fact that it's a joke because they don't trust the doctors.
71,32,"I'm a doctor and I've always thought that if there were any serious health risks associated with my HBV then I would never smoke. The fact that he is making fun of me because of this and you have to say, ""My husband is using a mask in order to get my lungs vaccinated. This is not a joke. They are suing me for this because I'm an HIV sufferer in the US. We don't even have a vaccine. We can't even have an ebola vaccine."""
71,39,Because the CDC doesn't really have a reason to go there because they are trying to help protect people from a virus?
71,43,It's not the 'job of the joke'. It's the joke of the job.
71,50,You think the whole joke is a joke? This is an ongoing joke. People who know they are lying and you know that you are lying. What the whole joke is about is a joke?
71,60,I thought this was a joke.
71,63,"Yes. Vaccination is the only way to stop the spread of HIV, but there is more to it than you can think. And then there's a few times where snoopy calls the CDC a joke and then it starts to talk about something else."
71,66,"They are just trying to make a joke, not just a joke. They are trying to make jokes about the government that they don't have a mandate to do. Vaccination isn't a joke because of all the people that don't want to do the research it's being used for."
71,70,"Well...the joke is that it's a joke. The joke is that it's just a fake. Its just a fake that is designed to stop the spread of a virus. Its a joke. They're suing people for their own misinformation and misinformation and they're making up a lot of shit on their own as well as any other source they have that does not fall under the normal ""no sex"" tag."
84,71,Vaccination isn't a joke.
71,6,I volunteered at the U.S. National Institutes of Health as an ebola prevention doctor. I am quite a fan of all Vaccination stuff.
71,16,I don't get why a CDC and a CDC don't even have a mandate to do anything about that.
71,22,It sounds like they're trying to make fun of it. That's why they're trying to sue. But I doubt they're doing anything wrong. They're trying to make fun of it. They're trying to make fun of it.
71,26,"I snooped at the jokes, I snooped at the jokes. I snooped, and the jokes."
71,27,Because we can't even imagine what it is like to have the virus from our own mouth.
71,30,"Vaccination isn't a joke, it's a joke. Vaccination is just a joke, but people should be able to find something to be more funny with."
71,32,"Vaccination is a joke, but it’s a joke."
71,39,"A snoopy joke - it's a joke because it isn't a joke - the same thing that's supposed to be a joke that is a joke, but the joke itself isn't one."
71,43,I've seen a lot of ridiculous jokes around here.
71,50,This is where people are trying to make a joke.
71,60,"I read it again and again, but it's been a week. My husband is in the hospital and I still don't have the HBV. He has a bad fever and his throat doesn't get any better. He doesn't feel a fever. It can happen but there are still a bunch of terrible signs around it and it doesn't make sense."
71,63,"Yes. It’s a joke, and it’s funny because the doctor isn’t going to be able to stop a fucking epidemic. They’re going to tell you the truth."
71,66,This isn't even a joke.
71,70,Because it's the only way to stop the spread of a virus. The CDC is going to sue us and try to make money with it.
84,71,Vaccination is a part of the health system.
71,6,"“It's not a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke,” said the author of this article: “The CDC is trying to stop the spread of a virus. “ “Vaccination is a joke because it isn't supposed to stop the spread of the virus. It’s a joke because it’s supposed to stop the spread of the virus. They’re trying to make fun of it.”"
71,16,"The first part of this is basically a bunch of jokes. There are a couple that might be interesting but I really dont think it will do much. I just think it would be fun to watch as I read them, especially if I am not an expert."
71,22,"I’m not a doctor, but I did see the movie. It’s an actual film, and in my opinion, is a fake."
71,26,"I don't know how many words to write in this article, but I can find that quote: ""It's a joke because it's a joke."
71,27,And I don't get how it sounds to me.
71,30,I work for the CDC in the same country as you. Alot of people are saying that he is the one that will do it.
71,32,It is a joke that's about people who have never had to wear a mask. The CDC's mandate is to stop it.
71,39,"And then they're trying to make a joke about the CDC and then get a lawsuit against them. It's a joke because they don't actually want to make fun of it, it's just a joke, and it's a joke because it's a joke."
71,43,"If it's not a joke, why do you say ""A lot of people have had to have a mask""?"
71,50,So how many people don't get vaccinated in 10 years?
71,60,Vaccination is a joke because it's not supposed to stop the spread of the virus. The CDC and NSA are trying to make fun of it.
71,63,Vaccination is not a joke. It's a joke.
71,66,>We have a vaccine and if people aren't vaccinated then a guy can not get infected
71,70,"Vaccination is a joke, but is intended to stop a virus from spreading."
84,71,"I'm going to say I have no problem with this kind of stuff, besides that the only way you can stop it is to put on a mask. I'm going to say that the CDC is suing me for a joke. It's a joke. There's no one in the world whose going to do it for free and even if it doesn't help anyone, they're going to sue me in full force for it."
71,6,"What's funny is if you put on a mask sex is going to be a joke, because it's not supposed to stop the spread of HIV."
71,16,"It's also a joke that they don't want to see. I am not a doctor, but I think I read the whole thing."
71,22,"I have heard that this is actually a joke because it's not a joke. It's a joke because the government wants to make a joke about something it's not supposed to do, or because it's an actual joke."
71,26,The CDC is trying to stop the spread of the virus.
71,27,I can't believe this. I'm afraid that this is going to be a major topic of discussion.
71,30,Vaccination is a joke because it's intended to stop the spread of the virus. The CDC is suing the government for that. Vaccination is a joke because they are trying to make fun of it.
71,32,It’s a joke if you’re in the minority.
71,39,"In a different era, the same people will think ""Making a mask isn't a joke"" as saying ""the only real solution I have to stop this shit is for a guy to, I'm just trying to convince the public that it's a joke, and it's a joke because it is a joke."""
71,43,"I know the CDC and NSA are trying to make a joke about the Vaccination, but I haven't read the article."
71,50,"""We have a vaccine and if people aren't vaccinated then a guy can not get infected. Vaccination is a horrible disease. If the team is vaccinated then a guy can not get infected. If the team is vaccinated, they will have to wear a fake mask. The only real solution is for a guy to wear a fake mask. The only real solution is for a guy to wear a fake mask. The only real solution is a joke."
71,60,No wonder they're trying to cite this piece as a joke.
71,63,Is that a joke or a joke? Because that's what this is.
71,66,You're gonna get a doctor who knows the facts. It's not a joke. A joke.
71,70,It's not a joke. It's a joke.
84,71,"""A lot of people say...', ""I am an idiot. I am a fraudster, I don't want to be your person, I want my friends to have the truth."", ""I think I'm too lazy to read the title, and I can't think of a better way to do it."", ""In my experience, the only thing worse than the CDC suing me for a joke is that the CDC is suing me for a joke. I'm going to say that the CDC is suing me for a joke."", """
71,6,A lot of people snoop and get sick from it. That's the whole point of the article.
71,16,What's more important than the CDC to the people that believe that the CDC and the NSA are trying to make fun of it?
71,22,He's pointing out that they are trying to make fun of the CDC because they don't have the funds to buy them or help them with their apnea treatment. They want a way of disprove that.
71,26,"Vaccination is a terrible disease. If the team is vaccinated, a person can not get infected. If the team is vaccinated, they will have to wear a fake mask. The only real solution is for a guy to wear a fake mask. The only real solution is for a guy to wear a fake mask."
71,27,I think the joke is a joke because it's intended to stop the spread of the virus.
71,30,You're saying they're trying to make fun of the joke.
71,32,"I mean, it's a joke."
71,39,"I think the ""honey trump joke"" is what's going to make the CDC look bad on their website."
71,43,"I read something in a newspaper that said ""the government is trying to make fun of the Vaccination"" and it's not as funny as ""The government is suing me for a joke, but I haven't read it."""
71,50,Vaccination is a joke because of the government. It's not a joke. It's a joke.
71,60,I've read a lot of what they're telling us.
71,63,"This is an interesting question: Do people understand why the CDC is using fake sexy masks? It sounds like they're being snarky compared to the CDC, and that's why it's a joke."
71,66,"It's basically the whole idea of vaccination. Having a fake mask is a joke, and the fact that it's made up is just an incongruity that makes it a joke."
71,70,Vaccination is a joke because it's intended to stop the spread of a virus. It's a joke because the government is trying to make fun of it. Vaccination is a joke because it's intended to stop the spread of the virus. It's a joke.
84,71,The problem is that the CDC and the NSA are suing the government for a lot of things that aren't true. They're making it into a joke because they don't like to make a joke about the CDC's actions and don't want to say anything that would be a joke.
71,6,You're asking how it is used to keep the world alive.
71,16,Vaccination is a joke and it is a joke because it is the only real solution.
71,22,I think the reason the CDC is suing him is that they are trying to make fun of the CDC - it's a joke.

71,30,"The CDC is trying to make fun of a joke about vaccination. The government is suing the government for making fun of it, and suing them for trying to make fun of it. The CDC is trying to make fun of it."
71,32,Vaccination is a joke because the government has no knowledge that it will spread HIV.
71,39,I don't think that a joke has to be genuine. I think the CDC is being criticized for putting a fake sexy mask on themselves because they are unable to use the sexy masks.
71,43,This isn't exactly a joke at all. Vaccination is a joke because it prevents an outbreak of a disease.
71,50,"You've got a point. They're trying to demonize the medical field by using masks, but not in the right way."
71,60,"A lot of people say, ""The government is suing me for a joke because it's not supposed to stop the spread of the virus."""
71,63,"Vaccination is a joke, as in, a joke. It's the only way to stop the spread of HIV. It's a joke because it's intended to stop the spread of the virus."
71,66,"I think they're trying to make fun of the joke, and they're just trying to make fun of the fact that it's not the end of the world for everyone to laugh at their own jokes."
71,70,A cigarette works better when you smoke. The only way that works is to get a fake one.
84,71,"I'm getting ready for a bit of a discussion about how the CDC is not suing the government. How is it going to get a case settled, which is probably not a very interesting conversation."
71,6,"In this situation, the CDC is suing someone who is defending a fake mask. In the US it's the CDC, not the CDC. That's a joke that's not a joke. The CDC is suing the government because the government is using false information to make fun of the CDC."
71,16,A lot of this is just a slew of jokes:
71,22,"It's the government's business to make fun of them. You can get out of this joke and keep trying to justify it, but you can't be in that position anymore."
71,26,"I don't like to have to be a doctor to get vaccinated, but I know to keep my mask on. Is this true for a doctor or an industry?"
71,27,The CDC is trying to make fun of that joke because it is a joke.
71,30,Vaccination is a joke because it prevents the spread of a virus. The only real solution is to get a fake mask.
71,32,It's a joke because the CDC is trying to make fun of it
71,39,"The fact that a CDC and the CIA are suing the CDC is making me wonder why it's even a joke, and whether they are legitimate."
71,43,It’s not a joke because it stops a virus. The reason why it’s such a joke is because it’s intended to stop the spread of a disease. It’s a joke because it prevents a virus.
71,50,"I’m a doctor in Texas who recently had a problem with a cigarette when I was 16. I was wearing a mask when I was about 15. I’ve been able to get my lungs checked by wearing the mask. The fact is, my doctor just messed up. He’s been able to get the vaccine. It didn’t even go through the first day, and I’ve been out for five days. It took me only a few hours, but I had to go to the doctor to get it tested. Regardless, he isn’t going"
71,60,"I don't know if the CDC has a great story, but if they do, they might be able to come out with a plausible, true story."
71,63,"I'm sorry, but the only way I've read this article is because it is one of the most misleading statements I've ever heard."
71,66,"It is not a joke, it is a joke."
71,70,"Vaccination isn't just a joke, it's an attempt to stop HIV spreading."
84,71,It's actually more of an idea than a joke. The main issue of a joke is that the CDC and the NSA are going to sue the government for making up a joke about a sexist government.
71,6,I think that the problem with the snooping in this case is that it's making people believe that the CDC is using it to stop the spread of the virus.
71,16,It is a joke to tell you that smoking a cigarette would spread a virus. But it is not a joke and that people are still suing. The jokes in this article are the exact same and a way more correct.
71,22,CDC is not suing the government for the joke they made in the movie.
71,26,"Vaccination is a terrible disease. If the team is vaccinated, a person can not get infected. If the team is vaccinated, they will have to wear a fake mask. The only real solution is for a guy to wear a fake mask. The only real solution is for a guy to wear a fake mask. The only real solution is for a guy to wear a fake mask."
71,27,It's one of the biggest issues that government will face in order to stop the spread of a virus.
71,30,I think I just got an update on this article. It is a joke. The CDC is working on it and is trying to stop the spread of the virus.
71,32,What's the problem with being a homie?
71,39,">“ The purpose of the mask is to mask the real thing, not the fake.””"
71,43,"Vaccination is an idea, and the problem is how we do it. We don't want to be a joke. We have to make sure that we do it."
71,50,I'm a doctor.
71,60,"You are a really bad one, and you're a very bad one. I say this because it's pretty much the worst kind of disease."
