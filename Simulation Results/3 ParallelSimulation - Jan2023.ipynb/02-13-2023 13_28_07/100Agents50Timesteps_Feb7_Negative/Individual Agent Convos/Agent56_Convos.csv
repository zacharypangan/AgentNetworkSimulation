56,17,"The NSA and CDC have no mandates for mask wear unless the mask is used by a hospital or something. The government is trying to prevent the spread of the virus through putting on a mask and then carrying a mask on, even if you haven't worn a mask in 10 years."

66,56,"I've never been to a team where the shady rules aren't enforced. I always wear the ""coolest thing to wear in the locker room"". I don't have a face mask. I wear a mouth mask all the time. This is a stupid thing to say, but it's so cute."
69,56,I don't think the CDC is doing this because it doesn't help with the spreading of a virus. I would do the same thing.
70,56,"When the government says this, the CIA has been trying to deter and even prevent it."
74,56,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
77,56,"I'm so sick of those stupid shittiest things on the planet. I'm sick of the people who aren't aware of their own actions, not knowing their own actions or how to properly handle them. I'm sick of the shittiest things on the planet. I can't take them seriously."

56,2,That was a scam. It's like the fucking guy that says he gets into trouble with the government by wearing a mask.
56,4,It was one of the first things that came to my mind when I went to the detroit Yankees game last year. I got a mask and screamed at them : 'I don't like it' I would do the same with the mask if it didn't work out'.
56,7,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
56,9,"I have a bad nightmare. I am not sure what you mean by ""useing a mask"" and I am not even sure what your comment is. If the problem is with not wearing a mask, and not being vaccinated or just claiming to be sick, it can not be a scam. If the problem is that there are not any rules about where and when people can be treated with a mask, then you are not getting a virus. It's not a scam."
56,13,"Apparently, the Government is doing the right thing when a sick person is not wearing a mask, iirc."
56,16,The 'wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.' I'd probably say something along the lines of 'Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.'
56,17,There are 2 issues here: 1
56,18,"It is. We can't even make a joke about how it is a scam if it is, especially when the government is trying to stop the spread of a virus."
56,21,We are talking about a scam that is made up of a bunch of people who have a problem with the government.
56,24,This is one of the reasons I don't know whether the CDC is actually trying to prevent the spread of the virus.
56,29,"The CDC is trying to deter and prevent the spread of a virus by stating that it will not stop people from wearing a mask. It's a good idea to make sure a person can protect themselves. It also means if you don't know how to properly handle a virus it's going to kill you, and if you don't know how to prevent it then it will get worse."
56,32,I'm going to start by asking what the CIA wants.
56,35,"If it wasn't a f-bomb, it wouldn't have existed. The government could have had other things going on in the world, including what the players have in the locker rooms, and what the player has gone through."
56,44,If a government employee is trying to keep the team safe they are gonna use the rules. The state can't stop a person from taking the rule that they were able to put on a mask.
56,48,>We lost a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam.
56,52,"I’m not saying I’m sorry but I do see where the CDC is coming from, I believe."
56,54,I feel like this is really funny.
56,55,"I love the idea of putting on a mask, but I hate wearing my face mask all the time."
60,56,In my state they say they can wear their masks but not required to. But not in my state where the public can wear their masks.
62,56,I have been told a lot of times that I'm not going to get any real medicine. When I have a real cure I just have a mask on. In my experience I don't think my doctor will do that as an absolute emergency.
66,56,I'm not a political scientist but I know it’s a virus and people have been saying it before I ever wore a face mask.
69,56,"It's not a scam, it's a way to force players to take things off their backs."
70,56,"Nope. 'When the government says this, the CIA has been trying to deter and even prevent it.'"
74,56,"The problem is that if your parents won't talk about this, they will be the skeptic in the room. They have no other choice but to tell you what's bad."
77,56,"I've had masks before as a teenager, it's just not like it's just not true."
79,56,">Wording a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.Trump said it's ok not to wear mask, and Ingraham said it's restricting our rights to keep us locked inside! You know our right to die and infect (kill) others. Why isn't Ms. Ingraham out there with them."
82,56,You are right. You can't be vaccinated at twitchcon. I'm just going to say that it is not a law that would stop a person from traveling to the United States to see a sd vaccine.
84,56,"I want to make sure you are not being in a position to use the mask, but when you do, you should be able to see what's going on."
87,56,You’re a scumbag. You’ve been trying to cut off a sexy mask for a long time. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
56,2,It's a scam. You can get to jail without a mask. You're a scumbag. Go see a policologist and tell them your family is in a very dark place.
56,4,Is the CDC using the CIA to prevent the spread of a virus?
56,7,If a government employee is trying to keep the team safe they are gonna use the rules.
56,9,That is absolutely terrible. And no one is going to change it to make it worse.
56,13,"I see you figured out your question, and so did you. It's possible the CDC is trying to sabotage the spread of a virus by disallowing a person to put on a mask at the first sign of a sick person. So here you are, trying to give some perspective on how to stop the spread of the virus."
56,16,"""The 'wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
56,17,"I'm not going to tell you that it's funny, but I do understand that it's important to remember that the CDC has some pretty serious ad hominems on their people (especially the CDC and the NSA). They're trying to be a force for the public to take a back seat and that they're a bad idea to do, so they deem it a fraud."
56,18,I'm assuming he means to give me a mask with a mask that says no? I cant really help you out if you're stuck in a place where someone is able to talk on the phone to you and you know you can't go out of your way to keep them away from my f-bomb.
56,21,It is one of the reasons I don’t know whether the CDC is actually trying to prevent the spread of the virus.
56,24,I'm a big fan of the anti-vaccine nonsense of it.
56,29,CDC trying to deter and prevent the spread of a virus
56,32,[Cdc and TWitchCon both have a special Congressional committee meeting this week.]
56,35,"There are a lot of people who would rather be protected by a mask, not an infected person, and it isn't a law that prohibits it, so the government is putting a ban on it because it's illegal in your state."
56,44,"Unless it’s a real virus, that’s not a scam."
56,48,This is the only thing a medical professional can tell you to wear.
56,52,"... but when it comes to viruses, I feel that people are being exploited by the government and the government can't have their privacy protected."
56,54,i would just get my kids to wear the same mask.
56,55,I’m a scumbag. I’m just going to go on with my day.
60,56,>But not in my state where the public can wear their masks.
62,56,"Putting on a mask is an absolutely stupid thing to do, because it's something you would want to do when your skin was already infected with HIV and it's not your problem."
66,56,"Vaccination is not a policy of the government, it's a fact that a person will always be a part of the game."
69,56,Wearing a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things I've ever done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask.
70,56,"This is one of those things where it isn't very helpful at all. This isn't a joke, it's a remark. I think it should be. If they don't keep trying, then the problem isn't the mask itself. The reason is, I have a scar on my face and a bad feeling and it works ok."
74,56,Is wearing a mask part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
77,56,"I don't think a good one to the people who do that can be a scam, but I also think the situation is not a scam."
79,56,Why is the person wearing a mask? Is it necessary?
82,56,"[We're looking at how you are going to make me feel at night.](http://www.nlc.gov/r/health/what_is_the_world/index.php) This is what I do when I'm at home with a friend who is vaccinated. Is he a cop, or an anti-vaccine activist, or even just a troll, or something? The fact that you have a question is fucking crazy. :("
84,56,"You have a job, I know, you have a family, you have a career, and I don't even have a job, so I don't really have a job. You have a family, I don't have a job. Those jobs are really important, but they're not your responsibility unless you are really in the wrong."
87,56,I'm not gonna lie! I've been trying to cut off a sexy mask for a long time. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks. You'll have to get a sexy mask. I lose a mask at least once a day and I go to bed in a couple of minutes. I'm not gonna lie! I've been trying to cut off a sexy one for a long time. Wearing a mask and getting

56,4,"Vaccination is not a policy of the government, it's a fact that a person will always be a part of the game."
56,7,I see your point. It's a scam to steal your mask from a victim. You're the victim.
56,9,"If it's a scam, no one is going to change it to make it worse. No one is going to change it to make it worse."
56,13,This is how I look at it. I'm a big fan of the anti-vaccine nonsense of it.

56,17,"I'm a doctor, so I want to be able to say that while he's making a great point about it, I also think a good one to wear masks is actually better than a bad one. He's going to have to wear a mask, so he can get vaccinated."
56,18,It doesn't sound like you want to be vaccinated if you want to get vaccinated.
56,21,"Yes, it is a scam."
56,24,> Is wearing a mask part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
56,29,They're going to have to tell us how to properly handle the virus before we can put any action.

56,35,"This is what I do when I'm at home with a friend who is vaccinated. Is he a cop, or an anti-vaccine activist, or even just a troll, or something?"
56,44,Vaccination is a thing of the past. A scar on your face is a scary thing to put on. It's the best way to kill the virus. Wear a mask and get vaccinated is the best way to stop it. Please wear masks. You'll have to get a sexy one.
56,48,This is very important. We should have a new mask as a part of our national vaccine program.
56,52,I think the trick is that you don't have a doctor to talk to you about it. It's up to you if you're on the internet.
56,54,People who don't care about their health will never even be vaccinated.
56,55,I'm a big fan of the anti-vaccine nonsense of it. CDC trying to deter and prevent the spread of a virus.
60,56,I'm getting some of the comments re: the government's attempt to fuck the NSA. What do you have to say?
62,56,I think you’re missing something here.
66,56,"Is the word ""scumbag"" in any of these terms relevant?"
69,56,"> I’m afraid if one official or admin address I’m able to help in that situation, but I’d like to say that if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet, I will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops,"
70,56,"I think the joke was a bit confusing at first, but in general people would consider it a good thing to wear a mask, because that mask has no place in the body."

77,56,It's not a scam. It's a good way to protect yourself.
79,56,"It's not just the federal government that's pulling the plug. In this case, it's the US that's pulling the plug."
82,56,Vaccination is illegal. That's why some people have to be vaccinated.
84,56,I think it's a great idea to try something new with my mom if she can get the help she needs from someone who knows her way around the virus.
87,56,It's the only cure.
56,2,"A bit misleading, but the article does address the fact that the virus is actually actually very common in the US. It's a good way to protect yourself."
56,4,"No one seems to think that this is something that should be part of the vaccine, as long as it isn't used by the NSA."
56,7,"The guy that was in charge of this thing had a mask at least twice a day and the person who posted it had been wearing it, too. That is just what he is doing here."
56,9,A mask is a part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
56,13,>I think it's a great idea to try something new with my mom if she can get the help she needs from someone who knows her way around the virus. It's the only cure.
56,16,It’s like saying to someone who’s not interested in science and is a prognosticator and a troll.
56,17,"My dad told me on the internet, ""It's all the best that a few people will be vaccinated by the next one,"" and then one of us... ""I will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops."""
56,18,A lot of the government's actions in preventing this kind of stuff are a little weird.
56,21,"Vaccination is illegal. In this case, it's the US that's pulling the plug."
56,24,"[At least the part about how they're trying to prevent the spread of the virus. They're going to have to tell us how to properly handle the virus before we can put any action. I’m a big fan of the anti-vaccine nonsense of it. This is what I do when I’m at home with a friend who is vaccinated. Is he a cop, or an anti-vaccine activist, or even just a troll, or something?"

56,32,"Vaccination is illegal. It's the only cure. We do this for people, not for those who are vaccinated."
56,35,It’s not the government that is pulling the plug. It’s the government that is controlling and preventing the spread of the virus. Vaccination is illegal.
56,44,"I'm so sorry, but this is an interesting misunderstanding of what the government actually is trying to do to fuck a virus."
56,48,"I'm not sure about a few people here, but I think I heard something like this:"
56,52,"Well, to be honest, it’s quite possible there’s a NSA-like government here that tries to try to get us to protect us from the NSA. It’s not like the NSA is doing anything right."
56,54,There's no denying the federal government's attempt to do good.
56,55,"I think that the phrase 'I want to go home, but I'm not going to go back to school' is way overrated."
60,56,">As long as it doesn't be a threat of serious harm, there is no reason to even think about what the NSA is doing. He can't do anything about it."
62,56,I'm not saying the government has a right to take everything they want. It's not illegal. I'm saying there's no reason to be afraid of the government's ability to do that and what they have to do is in a sense that it is.
66,56,Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of a virus.
69,56,Why not take a helmet off when you can't see a person? You're going to have a blast. You just have to find it at a doctor and then don't ask a guy to wear it.
70,56,"I'd be in a lot of trouble for not wanting to wear a mask, but it's a good idea to be wearing one. I think people can be more comfortable with their masks and they're more likely to wear something that may not be a good one to prevent or control the spread of a virus."
74,56,I am sorry to say this.
77,56,"I've seen a lot of people have this question. The US Government has no mandate for public exposure to the public, and if people aren't aware of what their masks can or can't do, they're not aware of it. The government has no legal obligation to cover up its actions. They're not even gonna tell you what you can and cannot do unless you're shady enough to say so. It's not really a scam."
79,56,"I'm not a political scientist, but I'm just curious if he would disagree with the slam on Obama and the slam on a mask that is a little more serious than the other two."
82,56,"He's a troll. He's a troll. He wants people to want him, so he tries to make him feel 'bad' for wearing a mask. He doesn't like it, but he does want people to have his back."

56,35,I think that most of these are just misnomers. The government can't be both narcissists and sexists or anything other than promoting their lies. Vaccination is the best way to stop a spread of a virus. I can see why it wouldn't have been a scam.

56,17,I think this is an excellent way to avoid dealing with the people that don't want to have to wear masks. I want the mask to be worn to get rid of the fuck out of my lungs.

I want to take care of that myself. I can't imagine if I could get one myself without being shot at. I could get one and get the CDC to tell me that it's illegal for the medical professions to cover their face and make it as safe as possible. I think it might work but for the rest of the"
84,56,The only thing the government can do to prevent the spread of the virus is to stop people from having sex.
87,56,It's all joke. They're just stating what they think they are.
56,2,"It is not illegal for the doctors and other medical professionals to cover their faces as safe as possible, so it's illegal. The US government isn't in the position to do it. They're there to help out."
56,4,"This is a joke. I have never had a bad laugh from wearing a mask, so I don't know what it is that is happening. Vaccination is the only cure for a virus that is not a virus. There is no need to say it, or get the government to do anything about it."
56,7,"The FBI and other public entities are doing what the FBI says they do. The FBI is suing the CDC and the CDC, claiming it is illegal."
56,9,"""But I don't have the time to give it much thought. I'm getting some of the comments re: the government's attempt to fuck the NSA. They need to make it legal, and then make it legal again so the president can stop being racist."""
56,13,"Vaccination is a joke because it's the only cure for the virus, not a joke."
56,16,I don't understand why they are getting a new look on their website. But it's a joke in itself.
56,17,Vaccination isn't a cure for a virus. It's the only cure for a virus that is not a virus.
56,18,Its not a joke. It is a joke.
56,21,I don't see how these jokes are worth talking about.
56,24,"If the president was being racist or something similar, I don't think the CDC is the one in the US. It's pretty crazy the NSA is the only one who's on the other side of this."
56,29,"I'm gonna take a look at the article and say: it's a joke, and it's a joke, and it's a joke, and it's a joke, and it's a joke, and it's a joke, and it's a joke. I think it's a joke, and it's a joke, and it's a joke."
56,32,"I'm pretty sure that the CDC was just using the term, ""hooray! I need to wear a mask, please."""
56,35,"This is the most absurd thing a lawyer can ever say in a conversation about a f-bomb, but that's why it's a scam."""
56,44,"I've seen a lot of jokes in my time at this forum, and they're pretty often ""you've got to wear a mask to protect yourself."" It's not really a joke. It's like saying, ""How is that not a joke?"" and then if it goes around again it's a joke, ""That's a joke, and it's a joke, and it's a joke, and it's a joke."""
56,48,">It’s like the government will just be suing people for their sexism in a future election."", ""I'm sure the CIA is a troll. This is why they are getting people in hot water - they're making their money from that."

62,56,"I had a friend that I met with from the CDC and told us to ""make a mask that's really good for me. It would work so good that it would keep me warm."""
66,56,"It's a joke. It is a joke. I feel like the CDC wants to ban vaccinations, but they don't want the government to stop the spread of a virus."
69,56,"It's like saying : ""Woe is the problem here isn't the mask. It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
70,56,The problem with a joke is not that it's a joke. I think he's ignoring some more important points:
74,56,"They've been in the news for years, and the CDC and CDC are all a joke."
77,56,That's because they're not even shady enough to say so. They are shady agents.
79,56,"Afaik isn't a joke. I don't know what it means, but I think people are being offended because the CDC is trying to ban the use of the mask."
82,56,They're ignoring the fact that the CDC and its partners are trying to make vaccination work.
84,56,The CDC is trying to protect people from the disease. I think the only way they can do it is to prevent a lot of infections. It's not a conspiracy theory.
87,56,We are trying to prevent the spread of the virus by not doing a face mask... so...
56,2,"if your mom doesn't wear a mask, you don't have a job. if she does, you don't have a job."
56,4,"Afaik isn't a joke, it's a joke, it's a joke, it's a joke."
56,7,"The FDA is suing the CDC and the CDC, claiming it is illegal."
56,9,I have a friend in the same situation. He was referring to the CDC.
56,13,I've heard a lot of these jokes.
56,16,i have to say the best advice I have has come from people who think that vaccination is a joke is not about being vaccinated for the purposes of prevention but about preventing the spread of a virus (they have been using the word f-bomb all their lives.)
56,17,"'Have you seen the whole'' ad hominem''? ''That's the real name of that sub,'''Oh, no. That's like a 'hooray! I need to wear a mask, please.'''"
56,18,"This is a huge problem, as you can see. During the past few years people have said that people need to wear a mask to protect themselves because of the virus."
56,21,The CDC wants to ban all medical equipment that doesn't work in the US. They're trying to prevent a lot of health problems for the people who have been infected. I don't know what a joke is.
56,24,"Vaccination isn't just a joke, it's just a joke. You've got to wear a mask to protect yourself, and the CDC will have to stop it from spreading your infection. Vaccination is the only cure for a virus that isn't a virus."
56,29,"I've been in a lot of jokes lately, but nothing really really a joke."
56,32,">A lot of people get vaccinated, but it isn't a vaccine."
56,35,What a joke. I think the CDC is being a troll and a troll who thinks that the government is preventing the spread of a virus. Vaccination is illegal.
56,44,Vaccination is the only cure for a virus that isn't a virus. Vaccination is the only cure for a virus that isn't a virus.
56,48,>It’s like the government will just be suing people for their sexism in a future election.
56,52,>I think people are being offended because the CDC is trying to ban the use of the mask. They're ignoring the fact that the CDC and its partners are trying to make vaccine work.
56,54,"I think you have heard the same thing, and that's kind of funny."
56,55,This is a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. I'm a bit of a troll. It is a joke. It is a joke. I'm gonna say it's a joke.
60,56,I’ve got a friend who said they were going to use a mask to prevent it spreading. They’re all going to eat a pizza smear and get an NSA-type infection. It's not even close to the best you can get from a mask.
62,56,"People are using a fake afaik mask to protect themselves from the spread of HIV, not a real AIDS virus."

70,56,"It's the only way to prevent a serious infection - to protect yourself, to get the best possible health benefits, and to stop people from spreading it to other people."
74,56,The CDC is not a conspiracy to take on a case of this. It’s a prank to tell some joke.
77,56,"So he says the government has no legal obligation to protect his employees, but it's not a scam, just a joke?"
79,56,So... we're getting into an incredibly illogical situation. Why does that even matter?
82,56,This is a good question that you need to have an answer to.
84,56,Vaccination is important for people like you. But it's also important for people like you to get vaccinated and have a job. So why would that make you a snoop? I think you may be thinking of a scam or a similar situation? Or perhaps a joke.
87,56,It's been proven over the years that the government isn't the only one.
56,2,It's in the law to cover your face without being in danger. It's illegal. But the CDC has a legitimate reason to ban this.
56,4,Vaccination isn't just a joke. It's just a joke.
56,7,"I'd do that and I'd yell, ""Hey! We all know that it's a troll, and it's not the CDC that has been doing this?"
56,9,So the CDC is trying to make the joke about the president?
56,13,"A CDC article recently suggested that a mask is needed to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS. It's not a joke, but it's also part of the way the government is trying to prevent the spread of the virus. I've been in a lot of jokes lately, but nothing really really really really a joke."
56,16,"I'm not sure how trolls can say these things, but in a sense it's a joke. It's a joke because we don't believe in the fact that someone gets vaccinated. It's just a joke."
56,17,"I know that in this day and age, the joke is that we are trying to stop the spread of a virus through some way. However, there is no way that it will be a problem in the future because people don't seem to understand it. Vaccination is the only cure for the flu, but there is an ad hominem in the story."
56,18,Vaccination isn't the only cure for AIDS.
56,21,This is a funny thing to say.
56,24,"This is a joke, and it's a joke."
56,29,"There are people who get vaccinated with a mask. Not so much the government, but it's not the government that's doing this."
56,32,"That's a lot of people getting vaccinated, but it's not a vaccine. What a joke."
56,35,I think it's a joke. I think that's why it's legal in the US.
56,44,"Because it's a joke, and I'm just gonna say it's a joke."

56,52,"Because they’re a CDC. A vaccine isn’t an actual vaccine. It’s a virus, but not a vaccine."
56,54,So your friend got a virus? Vaccination is the best way to prevent that from happening.
56,55,You're not a troll. You're a troll. That's what a troll is.
60,56,"As long as it doesn't be a threat of serious harm, there is no reason to even think about what the NSA is doing. He can't do anything about it."
62,56,It's funny because people are using a mask that they feel is the right way to stop the spread of a virus.
66,56,"They want to ban vaccinations, but not the government itself."
69,56,"A prankster is a joke when you have a hard time breathing, and you are allergic to the sprite."
70,56,The article makes it sound like he's not actually attempting to change the situation.
74,56,"A prank called ""It's not the government"" that's all I can say is ""that's not the problem."""
77,56,"I'm just saying, ""It isn't a scam, it's a scam."""
79,56,"This is the best way to get the political correctness right, that's all."
82,56,">I mean, it's probably an interesting story. He's a man, not a lawyer, and that's why people seem to think that a joke about vaccinations isn't real. It's actually just a joke. I don't think that's an accurate comparison. I think that's an accurate comparison."
84,56,I'd also like to add that some of these articles have a lot of references to a scam that the CDC and NSA are suing me for.
87,56,"The government doesn't need to get vaccinated for vaccines. They're going to have to pay a fee for the health insurance, and it'll take forever to get a vaccine."
56,2,"Why would you want to get a prank called ""It's not a scam""?"
56,4,This is a great example of a joke.
56,7,What do people find funny in these articles? That a viral virus is actually a joke that isn't a good way to prevent it?
56,9,"Vaccination isn't a joke. A prankster is a joke, but it's a joke."
56,13,Vaccination is a joke because it prevents the spread of the virus. The government is trying to prevent the spread of the virus.
56,16,"So he's basically saying ""The mask is illegal."""
56,17,I’m not a lawyer. But I am a lawyer.
56,18,I am not going to be the first to say that the president is making a joke about vaccinations.
56,21,That's because it's what the government is trying to stop.

66,56,The guy was not a dickhead. He is just a joke.
69,56,It's called a prank when you have a hard time breathing.
70,56,>I'm a CDC govt govt president.
74,56,It's a prank. It's about the government.
77,56,"A shaman has just said something about a problem in the story: The government can't tell anyone who is involved in that matter if you're unaware, and it's a scam. The CIA can tell you to take off your gloves, but they can't tell you what they can or can't do. The CIA can tell you what you can and can't do, but it's not the real deal, and it doesn't even mean they can't tell you what they can or cannot do."
79,56,Vaccines are the only way to prevent the spread of a virus.
82,56,"They're preventing the spread of a virus. Vaccination is not a horrible disease. If the team is vaccinated, a player can not be infected. If the doctors wouldn't want to buy it, the mask would be the obvious choice."
84,56,The CDC is suing you for fraud and fraud on the part of the CDC.
87,56,Vaccination for a virus. You want to stop that from happening? A sexy mask and getting vaccinated is the only cure. A mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
56,2,I'd have to say that unless I contacted you directly I would not be able to contact you in person because of the NSA.
56,4,And then there is the part about the government saying that 'vaccination is the only cure for a virus.'

56,21,"I'm gonna go ahead and say ""I’m gonna go ahead and say “I don’t think it’s a silly joke.”"
56,24,That was a good joke - you can tell anyone in the US about how you're a government official who will take a joke and not a prank.
56,29,The US has more people than it can possibly handle.

56,54,A CIA prankster isn't a joke. It's a joke. This is the way that things are in America.
56,55,It's all about a prank.
60,56,I don't think this is going to be a huge hit with any mainstream media. This is just an AMA claiming that a big problem isn't with the government.

56,17,Then you have to wear a mask and get vaccinated.
56,18,"I read that the first two parts of this post are the most interesting ones, but i agree. A large part is that people do not understand what they are saying about vaccines, not about the vaccine. And a lot of the comments just don't sound like they're serious."

56,24,Vaccination is not the only cure for a virus that isn't a virus.
56,29,It's all about a joke. It's a joke.

56,48,The CIA is trying to make a public health law against people who can't wear masks. It's a joke.
56,52,What are the numbers on the mask and why?
56,54,"That's a joke. Vaccination is a good start, but it's not enough to prevent you from becoming a full member of a government. This is a big deal, I don't think it's going to make much of a hit. The government is trying to do good, but he isn't."
56,55,"I'd do this: I don't care what the government says. If I mnt wrong, I won't think about it or say it."

66,56,"No, this is not a joke. You should go and get vaccinated."
69,56,I think that a restraining order is a good idea because it allows you to put on your gloves without being a jerk.
70,56,It's not that the joke is a joke. It's that you're a racist and you're not being funny.
74,56,So they're trying to prank you?
77,56,"The CDC is a scam, just not like a scam."
79,56,"I don't think you've heard a joke in years. You say, ""The first thing I would say is I don't care about the CDC/POLICE or their vaccination policy unless I was vaccinated."""

56,16,"This is a joke. It’s a joke because people don’t even realize that a mask is a joke, that a CDC scumbag troll."
56,17,The article's ad hominem is about how a person can get a virus vaccine and how they are going to stop it.
56,18,There are too many ridiculous things going on in the comments. If a guy in a suit is wearing a mask to prevent the spread of AIDS I think he is acting as though he is a troll.

69,56,The CDC can't even do something about it.
70,56,You're in for a shock here.
74,56,"""Is it really that funny? As a former CDC chief, I think that the restraining order is a joke. Wearing a mask is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks."
77,56,The NSA has no obligation to cover up their actions. It's a scam.
79,56,Vaccines are the only way to prevent the spread of a virus.
82,56,"So is his joke about being a doctor, with a lawyer, who is on vacation, and if he can't do his job."
84,56,"I can tell you that a big part of this is that the CDC is suing him. It's very simple. If you don't have the money and knowledge to spend on these types of things, you're a fraudster."
87,56,"I guess the reason the government is trying to prevent this is to show respect for the people who have been hit. The government has made it clear they have a policy of not protecting themselves from being infected, or that their treatment is not appropriate or appropriate. I guess the reason the government is trying to prevent this is to show respect for the people who have been hit."
56,2,I was just thinking that because we're talking about something that would be a joke to a lot of people.

56,13,"The CDC is doing a great job at preventing the spread of the virus. A good CDC job is providing medical services to those at the CDC who may not have access to the CDC, and that's where the problem lies."
56,16,"I think you can say the same things about this, but I’m still terrified about it.'"
56,17,I don't know how the government feels about the CDC or what they're doing.

56,21,"It's a joke, and I’m not an expert, but you seem to be right."
56,24,I don't know what the CDC or any other government body say on the topic of this 'joke'.
56,29,"I'd say it's a joke, and it's a joke. I think it's a joke because people are often wrongly accused of trying to control their actions. Vaccination is illegal because it is the only way to prevent the spread of a virus."

60,56,"""...It's kind of like the phrase ""Male Cover"" in some sense. The joke is about a joke, but the CIA tries to make it a joke."
62,56,Vaccination is a joke because it's a way to stop the spread of a virus.
66,56,"If your team is working on a viral vaccine, why not use it?"
69,56,I believe it's possible that a doctor who was sick was a scammer and was able to prove that it was true.
70,56,"It's not a joke because it's a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke, but it's not a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke, but it's not a joke because it's a joke."
74,56,The CDC has already started putting out a restraining order on a couple of people. It is actually a joke and the ad makes it seem like it was a joke.
77,56,'Shame' is a bad word but it’s an unintended prefix for shamans who are not trained in the word.

56,7,So... we're having the same problem here.
56,9,My doctor and I had a very difficult time believing this. We just didn't stop talking and we got a big deal about it.
56,13,You said the only cure to HIV/AIDS. That's a joke. The CDC is working to stop the spread of the virus. The government has no reason to care.
56,16,The only thing I'm going to do is try to convince the CDC of the joke.
56,17,Vaccination is not an excuse for trying to prevent the spread of the flu.
56,18,A friend of mine had a fake X-ray of this when he was 10 months old. It had a fake X-ray image and there was no one else there. He had to get one. His friend told him that if he went through a X-ray he would have been in a hurry. He contacted a police officer he couldn't be seen and he got an X-ray image of his dad.

It was that I was told I am a great doctor and can wear my masks and if I was unable to go to a psychiatric hospital or to a private hospital or whatever, I wouldn't be in a position to deal with a prank like this, I could never have a job, I was a slack spook in high school.

74,56,"The article states that the person who's getting vaccinated will be given the opportunity to wear the mask, to prevent the spread of a disease that is preventing a public health emergency."

82,56,Vaccination is not illegal. Vaccines are. The CDC is preventing the spread of a virus.
84,56,"I've found this to be hilarious. I think the most relevant example of this is the ""you have a job, a career, and you don't even have a job"" line. It's the same as the CDC and the NSA saying ""I have a job but I don't even have a job."""
87,56,"I'm a guy with a few other people who are doing the same thing, and their jokes are ridiculous."
56,2,The only thing that's been happening since the CDC's inception is a joke.
56,4,It was my first joke on the site. But a lot of the comments are like : It's not a joke. It's a joke. It's not a joke. It's a joke.
56,7,I can't think of a single person I'd go to hospital with without a mask.

56,13,'The only cure' is a joke.
56,16,"There's a CDC on the internet called ""Richardo"" that focuses on getting people to be vaccinated and getting vaccinated."
56,17,"Well, you do have to wear a mask, the doctor you were trying to get in touch with is not going to get sick from the vaccine or do any other things that will protect you from the virus."
56,18,"I love the line ""I'm not an idiot"", ""I don't know if you can't tell if you're an idiot."
56,21,"A lot of people seem to be doing it because they want to help people. Vaccination is not a joke. A lot of people are going to think ""you're a dick"". They want the government to get rid of all medical equipment that isn't working in the US. And the CDC is trying to stop a virus."
56,24,They're trying to sue the CDC for the use of a fake mask.
56,29,"I'm just going to say that's a joke. I mean, I know it's a joke, but it's not, and it's also not a joke. It's a joke."
56,32,"If it is a joke, I think it is legitimate. I think the first half of this is the most relevant."
56,35,I think this is just the point. This is one of the best jokes I've ever heard. I just can't stand the jokes they make.
56,44,What's the'scam'? Are you looking for the idiom that says Vaccination is the only cure for a virus that isn't a virus?
56,48,It's also a hysterical joke that doesn't even know how to write a joke. It's literally a word that says you have a job and you don't have a job. You do not get a job because you don't have a job. It's an excuse for you to be a terrible man.
56,52,The joke is a joke.
56,54,"I'd say it's a joke because people are the real problem, they don't really have any real reason to think that they're the only person who knows about the vaccine. But the whole concept of a mask is a joke because it's so important to know that someone has a virus, but the one who doesn't has one. So, yes, the CDC is using a fake to keep the vaccine from spreading. But the joke itself is a joke. I don't know how people might be making it worse, but they are doing a joke."

70,56,IANAL but I do not know a person who thinks he's a joke or what he's talking about.
74,56,This is an old joke. People in these days aren't going to hear it until they're in a relationship.

82,56,"Ingraham was not a racist. He was a troll. I'd not wear a mask, and in the same situation would I wear a mask? What does that mean?"

87,56,I'd be super surprised if I ever heard any of these 'Pleasant' in the book:

56,35,A guy who is a doctor who does AIDS research will often tell me how sick he is by telling me a joke to prevent them. I'm a doctor and the only reason I don't like AIDS is because it is painfully obvious and it can't be cured. I can't see why someone would just laugh at a joke that people don't think it's funny.
56,44,You should read this. I think you have the right to use c.dc idioms.

56,52,"Vaccination is not a joke, it's a joke that the government is trying to use to get people to get them to work, but in a way that is only an irrational joke."
56,54,Is it possible you would have to get a mask and the doctor could try to get it removed? I don't think that is something you can do at all.
56,55,The only difference between the two is that he can't be right with saying that he's a troll because he's not racist and a troll because he is racist and a troll and they're trying to discredit him for his bad work.
60,56,"I had a friend who used to do something that was funny while he was working. That was a part of what my friends call ""happiness,"" but they wanted something more than just a ""shitty, jokey job."" They said it was to make his work feel better, but they couldn't afford it. They got into a fight with the government and the people who wanted it."
62,56,So what's the point of an attorney?
66,56,"A joke is an insult, but it's not about the joke. It's about the joke."
69,56,It's one of the most absurd jokes in the US.
70,56,The joke is actually a joke about the CDC and the way they are trying to prevent AIDS.
74,56,Is this the CDC?

79,56,"As you said, a joke is being made in a manner that is entirely ridiculous, as you have no idea how to express it. It is the whole point of being a joke that is only meant to get people to know what it is."

84,56,"As a person who is a doctor who is not even a doctor myself, I can tell you the majority of the people I know are snoops. But this isn't just a joke, it's a scam. The CDC is suing the US government for fraud."
87,56,Vaccination is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
56,2,What happened in the story is the fact that the CDC is trying to ban this.
56,4,"I lost a mask last week. It is going to cost $20,000 to get it replaced and I haven't even been to an event."
56,7,That is a joke. I'd never tell the story to someone in my life if I had some time - I don't want to be part of a conspiracy.
56,9,Isn't that all you've said?
56,13,"A very short article about a guy who was trying to protect the government, but is suing CDC for fraud, and suing the government."

56,18,"No one here said ""That's not funny. It is a joke. It is not a joke."""
56,21,I feel like the title implies the fact that there are other pranks involving the government and the government who are suing the government.
56,24,"The CDC is not the only one trying to sue for it, despite having no idea who is behind the joke - the only one in the U.S. - for it. The CDC is suing the US government for fraud and the only one in the world that has any claim to it."
56,29,I don't think it's a joke because it is an outrageous joke that the CDC is trying to do to prevent people from dying if they don't put on a mask and try to help in anyway.
56,32,Vaccination is not the joke. It's the vaccine that was chosen by the US government.
56,35,Vaccination is illegal because of the fact that it's 'like' a joke.
56,44,"I don’t know if the CDC is a troll, but it’s true. Vaccination is actually the only cure for HIV/AIDS, but this isn’t a troll."

And you know I can't think of a better way to explain the situation if I'm actually telling it, but it's probably one of the most important things in your life."
69,56,I don't want to hear that because the CDC tries to prevent AIDS. I do want to hear that the NFL is taking steps to stop the spread of the virus and making a joke about it. It's probably going to be something that will happen soon.

82,56,"What's a troll, and what's a troll?"
84,56,"It sounds like the problem here is that snoops are bringing false stories about AIDS to the public. It's not that the government is just trying to make a joke about AIDS, it's that it's trying to get people to believe that HIV is a virus."

56,4,"I'm a bit embarrassed that this hasn't happened in my life, but I don't like the jokes here."
