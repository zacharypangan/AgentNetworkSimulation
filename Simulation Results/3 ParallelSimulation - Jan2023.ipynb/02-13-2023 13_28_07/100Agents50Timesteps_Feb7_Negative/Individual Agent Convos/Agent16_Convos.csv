16,6,"This is so unpopular. Trump made a joke about her wearing a mask while going to TWitchcon. It's ridiculous, and doesn't even have the ability to do anything about it. This is the same thing that Hillary did with Ted Cruz."

21,16,"The thing is, she is a woman. The thing is, this is not a legit thing to do. The masks in her mouth are all so small and fragile. They're actually only used to hold in small doses.

33,16,"The issue is that if you're a vaccinated person, and you're not able to get a vaccination without a mask, you need to wear a mask as soon as possible. If your not able to get a vaccine, that's your problem."
34,16,Is that your mask or your current one? The only thing you can put on it with is just a couple things.
41,16,"I am a very experienced person. I am a professional at a soccer club. I also know someone who is a coach and has to go through that too. I can go for a walk, go for a walk. I was asked to do this before my football team took over, and I was told to put on a mask."

71,16,I lost a mask every day. Now that I'm older I really think I'm ready for the next.
77,16,The first time I had a mask I just remembered that I had been exposed to a virus.
84,16,"The guy who says it's ok not to wear a mask was in the post on his site, that he doesn't wear a mask."

21,16,There's one book about her about how people who do not know what to wear in the US are attempting to prevent people from being vaccinated. That's pretty funny and funny.
24,16,if they keep saying oh you can't do this you can't do this it's illegal
27,16,It sounds like they're being sexist and need to get rid of this. The whole thing is a scam. It isn't true.
33,16,"Vaccination mandates for a person who doesn't wear a mask, or isn't vaccinated, are a felony."
34,16,"I think they meant to say ""I will go everywhere, take a seat, and see you around, and I will go to a hospital."""
41,16,It is all about your masks. It is not your fault that the government is doing that. It is your responsibility to protect us against these things.
45,16,">Hey, the last guy on your team has a bad record..."
51,16,The term that comes up is a bit misleading.
52,16,"I want to put this in front of the news. I've got a bunch of fucking people that are talking about this in this subreddit, but they're not fucking. I'm just gonna have to find out if it's really a scam or if it's a scam."
56,16,The 'wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.' I'd probably say something along the lines of 'Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.'
57,16,I've had to use a mask.
58,16,"It's the same problem as the Obama's ""Pence of Perpetuity"" rule."
59,16,">You are right to talk about the dangers of using masks, but they're only used for the purpose of preventing the spread of the virus. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
71,16,I have never worn a mask. I don't believe that there is anything to be gained from the 'bad' habits of this system.
77,16,"I'm really gonna have to get out there and go go on a date a few times a year, I think a couple months is just a waste of time. But I'm going to give you two oomphs."

88,16,I was the one that got me through this and made it home.

16,6,I'm not sure if it was the wrong or wrong thing to say or do.
16,11,Is that a joke?
16,14,"Ingraham is a really good person, so you are a little confused."
21,16,This is what I found out.
24,16,"It's not only a scam, but it's a dangerous disease."
27,16,"This is a shame to hear, but this has been a good example of how the government should be doing something."
33,16,"Isn't it the law in the US that mandates people who haven't been vaccinated to wear a mask, even in the first place?"
34,16,People are going to die from a virus in their lifetime.
41,16,>It is all about your masks. It is not your fault that the government is doing that. It is your responsibility to protect us against these things.
45,16,So you don't want to be the last guy to be the last guy on your team? Are you serious?
51,16,">The fact that they are trying to make you wear a mask, and it doesn't seem like it, is a prank."
52,16,It seems like some of the people I've met in the media have been lying and using it as an excuse. But there is also evidence of the guy wearing a mask and getting a medical card. This is a lot of evidence that someone else is lying. I've listened to people praising him for not wearing a mask because of his omission and the fact that the CDC is using it in order to hide it.
56,16,"""The 'wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
57,16,"CANNOTANSWER MAN. I lost my face mask when i was little. I couldn't see it, my face would fall and I'd feel alot worse. And I'm now at home."
58,16,"Well, the biggest issue is that the NIH has no policy on putting on masks and doesn't want to give the players a choice between a mask and a shield to stop the spread of a virus."
59,16,"he did it because of the lack of evidence about the person who was actually doing it - he just said he was not going to use it on his own people, he said they would only be wearing it to prevent a virus, which is why he was trying to do it because it was illegal."
71,16,They don't want to get into you.
77,16,Yes. You're a fraud. There's a lot of lies around the fact that the government doesn't have authority to wear a mask.
84,16,"I'd suggest you give the CDC a call for help, even if that's not an option. If they're using a mask, it would not prevent the spread of a virus."
88,16,It is not a virus. It is a virus.
16,5,"And you've read the AMA. It has a lot of details id be interested to hear more about, and that would be good to have a good conversation with a teammate."
16,6,... and you're talking about the government?
16,11,"In my opinion, this is a joke. It's about the fact that he can wear a mask, and not a shield or something like that, a little too much."
16,14,>Wild people in the media have been lying and using it as an excuse.
21,16,I don't think that's a legitimate excuse for putting on a mask. Is that just another one of those things that the government is actually doing?
24,16,"What's a joke? I’ve never been to a hospital. I used to do a doctor’s look and tell. I wouldn’t say that’s a scam, but it does come across as in a very nice way if it’s a scam. The fact that you can’t be in a room with someone that was not infected is an example of what’s going on in the field. But it’s not really a scam."
27,16,It sounds like they're being sexist and need to get rid of this. The whole thing is a scam. It isn't true. The whole thing is a scam.
33,16,I think you're just being sarcastic about this...
34,16,I'm going to get your life insurance.
41,16,Why is the title sexist?
45,16,>I’m a lot of times more comfortable playing the position of the captain because i wear a mask to defend me versus the coach because i am not afraid of the consequences of a mask when a game starts.
51,16,"if there isn't a way to stop the spread of viruses from spreading through your body, then the government isn't going to fix the problem."
52,16,It doesn't sound like he's being a fucking scam or anything. He seems like an obstinate dick.
56,16,"Vaccination is not a policy of the government, it's a fact that a person will always be a part of the game. Vaccination is not a policy of the government, it's a fact that a person will always be a part of the game. Vaccination is not a policy of the government, it's a fact that a person will always be a part of the game.

57,16,"CANNOTANSWER MAN. I lost my face mask when i was little. I couldn't see it, my face would fall and I'd feel alot worse. And I'm now at home. I can only think of one person who isn't very much into the business side of things and can't even be confident in the ability to communicate well. I think the most important thing you need to consider is that the masks are a scam to make people afraid to get in in public. Yes, you can get your own mask, if you're in"
58,16,"That's probably why it's not funny. Until now, you've been making it sound like you've been trying to get an answer to the question of who wants to be president. You don't need to see the president for any more than a brief moment to find out if he is trying to get rid of the president's mask."
59,16,"The fact that he doesn't wear a mask at the start of the play shows that there isn't enough information to tell if this is a really bad idea. The guy is not a terrorist or a human being. It's a major thing, but its not an innocent thing. This is how the government has acted in the past. It is not something that the government should be concerned with, but it is a very important thing."
71,16,"I'm sorry. I'm getting to the end of my speech and then I go and I do it a lot! I do it a lot! I don't know if it would work for so long as I was a smoker. I'm sure there are plenty of people who believe in a ""smoking mask"" looks like. It’s a bit of a fake - it’s just something that makes you think, not real life, is fake. I'm very sorry."
77,16,"I lost a mask when I was a CIA agent, it was a mask that I had never worn on my face and was worn on my head a lot. I was still wearing it on, and it was the most infuriating thing ever."
84,16,This is a scam. They're not a scam.
88,16,"This is not the best explanation. This isn't a question I'm asked. Rather, it's an answer to what a lot of people get upset about."
16,5,There's also a book about Obama who talks about this:
16,6,I feel that these people are so in the right here.
16,11,"It is a sexist joke, but it is a joke that hasn't been proven true."
16,14,I have always thought he is a very nice guy but his comments have been pretty awful.
21,16,The only reason that my husband wouldn't wear it at least four times per day is because he wouldn't have been vaccinated and so his wife didn't want to wear it.
24,16,"[NAME] is a very young male who has never been diagnosed with HIV/AIDS and has been at risk of it for 2 years. He is an active, active member of the NFL and has been the leader of a few groups."
27,16,A doctor's office. They are the one who would be able to prescribe it. They do not even have access to it at their hospital.
33,16,You're not just being sarcastic. You're just being sarcastic about how people see this. You're being sarcastic about how the government is using such lies to get away with it. I don't even know where you're coming from. You're just being sarcastic.
34,16,"I would go to a TWitchCon and say ""I don't want the government to come on my behalf."""
41,16,I’m sorry to say this was taken as fact.
45,16,"This is a very good article, I'm sure there will be some 'what are the chances of you being sick' comments."
51,16,This makes me laugh a bit more than the rest of you who're just pointing out.
52,16,"I'm an agnostic lawyer so I was curious as to why this guy could have said something like this. You've just done some research to learn more about the mask, and you've been a good guy."
56,16,It’s like saying to someone who’s not interested in science and is a prognosticator and a troll.
57,16,Is this on a sub that people haven't heard of yet? Because it's pretty obvious this subreddit is full of shit.
58,16,We're supposed to be talking about all the people who wear masks to help prevent the spread of viruses.
59,16,The article is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.The fact that he doesn't wear a mask at the start of the play shows that there isn't enough information to tell if this is a really bad idea.
71,16,"A mask that you wore when you got a smoker, was a scummy version of a joke in English."
77,16,Honestly this is one of those questions that i will never forget. I think this is really a pathetic post because this whole thing is so sad.
84,16,"There are people who just can't see their masks. People who just don't see their masks, and people who can't see their masks, have no idea what they're doing."
88,16,I'm sorry...but I can't even make it out of the fact that I'm just so glad he was there. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
16,5,I've actually had a few contacts who had a few friends who would wear masks and would have been more concerned about that kind of thing than I was with them. It was all on the same page on the internet.
16,6,Are you sure you aren't an agnostic lawyer? Because I am.
16,11,I'm sure it's just going to end up on here.
16,14,He can't stop the virus. He can't stop people from putting masks on. But the people who wear them don't understand that you're supposed to be immune to HIV.
21,16,"Vaccination is illegal. In this case, it's the US that's pulling the plug."
24,16,"The restraining order is a bit too harsh for the guy. I'm sorry, but I think that's the best thing to ever happen to the NFL, and it doesn't. I’m sorry, but I think that’s the best thing to ever happen to the NFL, and it doesn’t."
27,16,"Vaccination is not the only medical benefit. If the government is mandated then they will not give any other benefits. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. There's a new thread on reddit called 'I don't think I've ever seen a joke like that about wearing a mask. This is actually a joke, not a joke."
33,16,"It doesn't seem like the guy is being a scammer. It is a joke. The idea of wearing a mask because the person you aren't being a fraudster is a scam. The idea of wearing a mask because the person you aren't being a fraudster is a scam, and it isn't a legitimate reason to use it."
34,16,They did it in 2009... and the CDC decided to not take it off at all. It's still a joke.
41,16,The article is inaccurate. Vaccines are the only way to stop a virus. I'm a member of the Vaccine Club and have a friend with one of these. They're basically a 'those who don't know what they're doing' group. They wear masks to protect people from a virus and not the rest of the public. They even use a mask to protect people from a virus and the public gets sick. They don't know how to wear the helmet because it ain't safe.
45,16,"Vaccination is a big part of the game, especially when you have a CDC. They are also very sensitive to infections from certain vaccines. In addition, if the players are wearing masks, they can get a bacterial infection. That's one of the major reasons people do not wear masks."
51,16,"They're trying to make it so we can get some sick people to wear a mask. I was on a mission to get them out of this, and it didn't get any better. So I think I'm just being a prankster."
52,16,No. The person is being a scammer.
56,16,"Vaccination is illegal. It’s the only cure. We do this for people, not for those who are vaccinated. It’s not like the government is pulling the plug. It’s not like the NSA is doing anything right."
57,16,"It is a scam, and it makes people feel bad."
58,16,"[NAME] is one of my favorite politicians, and I don't even think it's funny."
59,16,"Vaccines can't be made into a weapon without the help of a prescription. If you need a drug, a mask might be a good idea."
71,16,I don't think it's a scam.
77,16,"The government does have a mandate to cover things up, but the CIA knowingly does not."
84,16,I read this in the voice of the American Psychologists who worked with them. They say that they are the only thing stopping the spread of HIV. I believe that the government is making it so that the people who have the disease are not sick by not being vaccinated.
88,16,"It is a virus, not a disease, or a disease. But what it's called is a disease that causes people to have trouble breathing. You can have it in your body, but it can still go anywhere, and you have to have a proper respiratory system to take care of it."
16,5,">We do this for people, not for those who are vaccinated."
16,6,Are you sure you aren't an agnostic lawyer? Because I am. I'm sure it's just going to end up on here.
16,11,"It's not like there is a conspiracy on his part. He's being a prankster, and you can not help him. If you want a prank, just take this as facts, and ask yourself if it's right to be a prankster."
16,14,"If they did take off the masks, they'd still be able to go to their own hospitals if they're sick enough to keep going."
21,16,There are multiple ways to keep a person from getting sick.
24,16,The Devil Wears a Mask is actually a documentary called 'Ingraham's Mask' which is about this hive mind of a doctor. It's not a really good film and it's very good in every way.
27,16,The NSA is not mandated for the benefit of people. It has been used for the benefit of the people and has made it impossible for sexist men to use masks.
33,16,It is a joke. I think it's an interesting idea.
34,16,A couple of things. And I'm gonna say that's a lot of things.
41,16,Vaccines are the best way to stop the spread of viruses.
45,16,"Yes I know, but I think the other side of the coin was not what it was referring to. It was the idea that the CDC was able to send a threat to the president. If they were able to pull the CDC off they would have to sign a release. If they were able to get a response, I'm sure they could've taken it."
51,16,"> It sounds like the US President has a problem with what the NSA is doing with this. I've tried wearing a mask before, but it doesn't work. I'm pretty sure it does work with your nose. It's illegal, even if you don't want to think about the issue."
52,16,"I'm sorry I could have gotten downvoted so much, but I know this is a joke."
56,16,"Vaccination isn't a policy of the government, it's a fact that a person will always be a part of the game."
57,16,I'm gonna try and find the NSA's best guess for what I don't know.
58,16,You mean they are trying to get rid of the president's mask because it's the best thing to happen to the football players and is actually going to put on a mask in the first place?
59,16,"I mean, what exactly would you recommend to you, but you aren't supposed to be a part of that."
71,16,"I'm gonna take some pills now, because of the repercussions. But I want to... It's a fake, a scam, I can't imagine any more than that."
77,16,"The problem is they have a very clear definition of ""scam"" for a reason. And I think that the idea of ""scam"" is so good that it isn't a serious issue in that it's a ""fucking ""issue"" of ""a scam""."
84,16,The first part is a scam.
88,16,"No, it’s not a virus, it’s a virus."
16,5,"""They are trying to get rid of the president's mask because it's the best thing to happen to the people and is actually going to put on a mask in the first place?"
16,6,The one thing you really need to do here is to look up the NSA's hive mind.
16,11,"Vaccines and HIV aren't good. The CDC and the government aren't working together. They're trying to prevent HIV and HIV from spreading through our bodies. The CDC is trying to get the US president to adopt a system that protects against it. If a person takes some of their HIV from others and is infected by the CDC, then it's a scam."
16,14,"Yes, it’s a scam, but you’ve got some serious facts if that’s what you want to know."

52,16,I think the answer to this is something I'm going to find out.
56,16,You’re making a big leap forward.
57,16,The Obama administration is trying to sell a medical device that can prevent HIV/AIDS and the people who are infected with it.
58,16,I'd rather see the white house explain to the president what was going on at that time.
59,16,"I'm glad that your comments weren't funny. Vaccines aren't always used as a vaccine, but they are a safety net. They can also be used for other purposes. They even use a mask to protect people from a virus and the public gets sick. They don't know how to wear one."
71,16,A mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
77,16,"So, if you are a CIA agent that was exposed to a virus, and that you have a mask you lost, then the CIA isn't responsible for the spread of the virus. (I don't believe 'a'is wrong in the general sense of the word but still wrong.) So you should talk to the president and you will talk to him about it."

34,16,The CDC is just trying to protect our health. You aren't entitled to a right to defend yourself.
41,16,Vaccines are the only way to stop a virus. The article states that people wear a mask when they go out to play. The government is not allowing someone in a coma to have access to health care.
45,16,"In the case of the CDC, they were allowed to take off their masks in the middle of the game. So they were going to have to take off the masks."
51,16,That's what the CDC's own book says. You can go to their website to find out more. It also has more details about how the CDC will try to smear an outbreak name on people.
52,16,I think the answer is something I'm going to find out.

It doesn't mention the word 'vaccinated', but the'skinny' part. Those kinds of things aren't common in the United States and I don't know why it's so popular.

16,11,This is a ridiculous thing to post. I think you are just a troll. You are an idiot.

The CDC and the government are sabotage. I'd be surprised if the CDC ever did something about this but it would be very hard to imagine"
24,16,The CDC isn't involved in this. They're not involved in it.
27,16,So this isn't a joke.
33,16,The CDC has said that a virus that they haven't vaccinated people is a clone of the virus.
34,16,"I don't think there is a restraining order for the CDC. It does seem like a little like it might work to a degree, but this is basically a joke that is about how people are going to die from a virus. It's not about how they fucked up and their masks will not help."
41,16,"In the context of the CDC, it is not possible for a member of a CDC-led group to wear a mask to go play games. It would be illegal to do so. If they are the only ones who can do this, that would be a bad idea."

59,16,I agree that you're in the wrong here. The article says that wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. I don't see the difference between that and the fact that this article was made to show a point.
71,16,"I think people who think in the US if they can't stop people from smoking, they don't have a problem. It's ridiculous."

21,16,"Vaccination is very important and is the best way to stop the spread of a virus. There is no way to prevent people from getting sick unless vaccinated. It's a joke.

24,16,Vaccination is not a good way to prevent HIV/AIDS. A virus has very strong immune responses. A virus has very strong immune responses. It's a contagious disease that can be treated by taking a very severe bite from a mask. My grandfather in law had a problem with his mask and he would always wear it at the time because he wouldn't have gotten to see anyone else on the street. He wouldn't know when to go and wear a mask. It's illegal to have a restraining order. I
27,16,I don't think the NSA can prevent people from getting vaccinated in any way because they know what's going on with people and people not being vaccinated. I think the fact that a lot of people think that vaccines are the only thing they can prevent from spreading in the USA isn't a joke.
33,16,The CDC has no obligation to censor the sales of masks. I would argue that the government should have an obligation to provide it to the public because they know that people who haven't been vaccinated can become victims of it.
34,16,"I think the more interesting fact is that the guy is saying, ""What if I was a doctor, I wouldn't wear a mask on people with an illness or a medical condition (with a virus) so I wouldn't need to be a doctor."""

I hate the way they are making sure they aren't playing with a guy who's a medical malpractice lawyer. It's very common in sports and sports journalism. I hate the way they treat players, so I avoid those people, and I hate that it is so popular."

57,16,So... what did you say to this commenter?
58,16,I was able to put on a mask to prevent the spread of a virus and not see that because the president doesn't know what a restraining order is for.

16,6,CANNOTANSWER is a moron.
16,11,I think he is trying to get the people that don't know what a mask is to prevent people from getting infected into something he should be more open about and not just have a prank. He is being a prankster and is acting like a troll. You imply the President isn't interested in public health care. So he is trying to get the people to know what a mask is to stop people from getting vaccinated. That is a joke.
16,14,"I'm surprised he's not referring to the president as ""a military officer."""
21,16,I was the only one who thought the CDC was a joke.

51,16,"The thing is, the CDC is trying to make it so that you can get sick people to wear a mask. It's illegal. And a little bit of a joke. But it is a good idea. They are doing that for fun."
52,16,"You want to know what the truth is? He is an obstinate dick who is trying to be a good guy, but he is not being a scammer. He is a crook who has a problem with this scam and is a terrible person. Vaccination is the only cure to a virus. The only cure is to protect yourself from any form of infection."
56,16,"Vaccination is the simplest solution to stopping the spread of a virus.

57,16,I think the most important thing you need to consider is that the masks are a scam to make people afraid to get in in public.
58,16,The CDC isn't doing what Obama did. The only thing they can do is go out with a doctor and then put on a mask.
59,16,"I'd consider your comment being a little over the top. Basically a bad joke. I mean, I'm not saying it isn't a cliche. But I'm a faggot. That was a joke."
71,16,"I do it as well, and am an idiot. It's actually a joke."
77,16,"[Although he doesn't cite this as the source, I've read that this is a lot of different things than it was before](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theme_Obama.png). But I am pretty sure it's a really stupid joke."
84,16,"I didn't know that people were vaccinated, but I do know that you've been vaccinated to prevent HIV and to not have to keep yourself infected, and that the CDC is suing you."
88,16,"So, after years of doing nothing to help, I've decided to stop doing it."
16,5,"A lot of people are now expressing their concern about the possibility that Obama will be President, and in some states they are going to do something about it."
16,6,I'm not sure what he means but this is the exact same thing as the guy who sounded like a moron in terms of the joke.
16,11,"This is going to make the presidential nomination harder, and it is going to go to the candidates and the presidential candidates. They need to make a decision on whether to put masks on - and if not, whether to put on them at all."
16,14,It doesn't sound like they're trying to sabotage the government's role in stopping the spread of the virus. They're just dumping people into a hive mind.
21,16,"There are dozens of things the US government is doing. It may be necessary for the government to do something, but it might not be a legitimate reason to go and get one in the first place. It might be a simple matter of taking a prank on someone with your money."
24,16,I don't see this story as an example of a scam.
27,16,Vaccination is not a joke. It's a fact despite its origins. Vaccination isn't a joke. A joke despite its origins.
33,16,"I've seen it before, but it's not really fun. The CDC is using the masks as a way to get people to go to the doctor to have a vaccinated person get a vaccine. But even if they don't, they have to go, and they can't get rid of it. If they can't, they're doing the opposite. Vaccination is good and it's a prank. It's not a joke."
34,16,"We need to go back to the 80s and not get the virus everywhere. That’s where we came from. You could have used the CDC to stop the spread of the virus (remote taser). I sneezed and screamed at the cops, because i was about to be killed and I needed my shit."
41,16,"> I think the government is a troll. It just seems like a stupid idea to me. I just don't want to have to say ""I don't see anything wrong with wearing a mask, and knowing that the CDC is going to be very effective at preventing the spread of HIV."""
45,16,"""In the case of the CDC, they were allowed to take off their masks in the middle of the game. So they were going to have to take off the masks."
51,16,"You're being an asshole, right? It sounds like a joke. It's not like I've ever heard a joke about a president being a shill and not knowing how it works. But, the President is being a shill because he doesn't know how to get a virus into my throat. What does that have to do with the mask that is a joke?"
52,16,"Vaccination is the only cure to a virus. The only cure is to protect yourself from any form of infection. It's not a joke, just a joke."
56,16,I'm sorry for your loss.
57,16,I'm very proud of myself. I'm the only one who will ever find my way to the front page of this subreddit.
58,16,"What do you mean ""Fuck the president""?"
59,16,"So you've got to give up the opportunity to think critically about all the problems that we have in the country and have to make choices, like where you live or work? I'm sorry, but I'm a faggot. That was a joke."
71,16,"I'd think that's a joking joke? There's no shame in that if the government does nothing about it, and that's not a good idea, even if that's not the case. Hopefully it helps out as much as possible."
77,16,This is one of those situations where it really is a pathetic post because it is sad.
84,16,A friend of mine lost his face mask all the time in the summer and had to go to a hospital to get him vaccinated. He says he has an extra one for a bluff every time he gets to visit the doctors. He was in a fucking accident and had to get himself vaccinated.
88,16,"I want to clarify, OP : he wears a mask because it makes people uncomfortable and makes it easy for you to get the rash."
16,5,And this is why I'm the only one who is going to find my way to the front page of this subreddit.
16,6,"My husband's a guy I've had to see with a mask. He had a rash of mumps before getting it, he was just so bad he had to get it smacked. He's a good guy but he's not good enough to help out."
16,11,"""I think it is a joke. It is a joke."""
16,14,It's hard to be a troll and not actually a joke. That's an interesting question.
21,16,I see it is a good way to convey your opinion without being racist. That's why I'm not from the US. I've been there before.
24,16,"I mean, it's pretty ridiculous how much people do this."
27,16,Vaccination is a fact. It's a fact despite its origins.
33,16,A lot of people are being sarcastic.
34,16,"I'm pretty sure that the most important piece of sarcasm in the whole thing is the one about what kind of person is wearing the mask. They have to get it right, they have to get it right."
41,16,"A lot of people have a question about the CDC, but some of them are saying that they're a scam. What's the point of a restraining order? I'm afraid they're really trying to make him a joke. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of HIV. Please wear masks."
45,16,Vaccines and masks are the best way to prevent the spread of a virus.
51,16,"""It's a joke."""
52,16,"It's actually just a prank. It's not about the CDC, it's about the government."
56,16,I don't understand why they are getting a new look on their website. But it's a joke in itself.
57,16,"Vaccination is not a joke, it's a joke."
58,16,You aren't wrong that wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
59,16,"This isn't a joke. It's a joke that you do know how to use. Is this why CDC, I do not know how?"
71,16,"People have been so shitted by their moms I can't see how anyone would be going to any of her meetings without an aviator. They aren't really even the ones who can get vaccinated, they're the ones who are willing to try it out."
77,16,I think the people who see the movie are being a bit selfish.
84,16,"It's a scam. We're not on the same page. It's a story about something that happened and people in the world were like, you gotta go for a kiss, don't have your mask on."
88,16,He was a doctor and he did not tell you that it's not a virus. That's one of the most common illnesses to be a result of infection if it's not caught immediately.
16,5,I read this one by a friend of mine a few years back. The CDC is a scam. They're not interested in the facts but they have to do something about it.
16,6,That's all sarcastic and ridiculous.
16,11,"You're not a troll, you're a prankster."
16,14,I agree that wearing a mask is the most important thing to do to stop the spread of a virus. But i would be more concerned if I was going to be in a situation where the people would not be there if i had the right to be in a position where I wasn't going to have the right to be there for my team.
21,16,A prank is when you see a man make fun of you for his knowledge of what a prank is and they tell you it is based on it. It's called a prank.
24,16,They also have the opportunity to make sure they don't end up with a virus and infect a whole population.
27,16,I've actually found it a bit weird that the NSA is a fraud. I think it is kind of scary that they are putting on a mask to prevent a virus to spread if the government actually has the money.
33,16,I just want to say it's actually hilarious. The CDC is using the masks to try and get people to get vaccinated against a virus.
34,16,"Vaccination is not a joke, but it's part of the government's plan to keep people from dying of a virus. Because of the ""saber mask"" and the ""mistakenness' of the NSA, it's not a joke."
41,16,The headline is misleading because you don't have to wear a mask.
45,16,">The issue is, they're all scams. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of a virus."
51,16,CANNOTANSWER) Is this a joke or the author being a complete liar?
52,16,"""I'm sorry I could have gotten downvoted so much, but I know this is a joke."
56,16,i have to say the best advice I have has come from people who think that vaccination is a joke is not about being vaccinated for the purposes of prevention but about preventing the spread of a virus (they have been using the word f-bomb all their lives.)
57,16,This is a joke. The only thing that smacked off on me was a joke. I'm gonna go on a bit with this.
58,16,"The president's role in this isn't to help with the virus, it's to stifle the spread. If Obama wants to fight the disease, then he has to protect himself by not playing for them, because he doesn't want to kill everyone in the world, a virus, and a mask."
59,16,"CANNOTANSWER SAID THAT if it weren't for the CIA, that would be a cynical dissenter."
71,16,The problem with this is the lack of good news.
77,16,"I think OP's 'Midnight Guy' is the most relevant. He has been the most enlightening shaman in the history of the country, and the only one he thinks is relevant and not the most intelligent."
84,16,"""I am a liar. What's your point? I know it's a scam. The CDC is suing me for fraud. And I didn't know it was a scam. I know it was a scam."
88,16,There is a very high chance that someone is afflicted by some sort of microbial virus.
16,5,"""I'm sorry I could have gotten downvoted so much, but I know it's a joke."
16,6,">I'm sorry I could have gotten downvoted so much, but I know it's a scam. The CDC is suing me for fraud. And I didn't know it was a scam."
16,11,"I'm not sure if this is a joke or not, but I've heard it used by the White House and the CIA as a way to scare people away from an infection and potentially a real threat to the health of the population."
16,14,Vaccination is NOT a good way to stop the spread of a virus.
21,16,There is a story about a man who swore a mask that had no idea what a prank was and he thought a mask was a joke.
24,16,"I mean, I’m a doctor. I’m sick of being on band aid, but I do what I can to keep people from going in and out of hospitals."
27,16,"I've seen this in multiple threads, and I've seen a lot of shady things."
33,16,"There are a lot of people in this subreddit who are expressing their support for the CDC, and they do not accept their position."
34,16,"A friend of mine just got a virus from a cigarette. They used it as a mask for a child, who had no idea that it was an infectious disease. A friend of mine got a virus from a cigarette lighter. They used it as a mask for a child, who had no idea that it was an infectious disease. A friend of mine got a virus from a cigarette. They used it as a mask for a child, who had no idea that it was an infectious disease."
41,16,"I don't think people in the US or Canada are aware that this is just a joke. I think if you want to say ""I don't see anything wrong with wearing a mask, and knowing that the CDC is going to be very effective at preventing the spread of HIV,"" you're going to want to say that."
45,16,"There is a lot of speculation about the vaccines going to be going to the vaccines clinics, but the article says the players are vaccinated to prevent the spread of the virus. It says that the players and the CDC are not going to do anything to prevent the spread of the virus. The article says the CDC is suing the article for fraud and it says that ""The CDC and the players don't always say ""scam"" or ""scam"" to people, but the article makes some good points."
51,16,Obama tries to hide the fact that he has a virus but doesn't want to give him a mask. The guy he was in contact with who was able to stop the spread of a virus doesn't know how to make a mask that will help. It's a joke.
52,16,This is a joke. The CDC is trying to ban the use of a mask. They are ignoring the fact that the CDC and its partners are trying to make vaccine work. I think people are being unhelpful.
56,16,"I'm not sure how trolls can say these things, but in a sense it's a joke. It's a joke because we don't believe in the fact that someone gets vaccinated. It's just a joke."
57,16,"I read the article, and it seemed pretty obvious that they are doing this to make people feel bad. I don't think any one can believe the hype over the Obama years without trying to scare them. I'm going to go to the front page of this subreddit, and I'm going to try to find the NSA's best guess for what I don't know."
58,16,What happened to the players who got infected by HIV? Is this what was going on when the players were vaccinated?
59,16,"Vaccines can't be made into a weapon without the help of a prescription. If you need a drug, a mask might be a good idea."""
71,16,It's a joke. There's no shame in a joke.

84,16,You can read more about this on Reddit.
88,16,"So, if he doesn't have a virus, what he is talking about is actually a virus, a virus that can cause a disease."
16,5,I think it would be a good time for the people on the sidelines to explain why you don't like the guy. Is the guy just lying?
16,6,A virus is a joke.
16,11,The CIA is trying to stop a virus from spreading to the US. The CDC is trying to stop it from spreading.
16,14,"I have a very different perspective about this situation. You should have a conversation with the CDC about what was going on. It's really like they're doing it to scare people away, and they're actually trying to make the president a joke for using it. It sounds like a scam."
21,16,This sucks because we're just gonna rape the other day.
24,16,"My father in law had a big problem with his mask because he had been diagnosed with a virus for two years. He told me his wife had been sick for three years and is now being vaccinated. When she gave him an invitation to meet up with him to talk about it, he said to her: ""I'm sorry, but I'll resign and not coach until this nonsense stops.'"""
27,16,"I have had a great trip to New York City and I really like how he's telling this joke (I had one when I was 14 and I didn't even realize there was one!). He's the kind of guy that thinks that's the point of the CDC and he doesn't think that the NSA is a fool. There isn't much info about the CDC, so I would recommend going to that location."
33,16,The only people who haven't been vaccinated are the black people.
34,16,It sounds like the government is trying to stop the spread of the disease by trying to make a joke about them. The president should be working on a new way to prevent it.
41,16,They have been able to stop this virus from spreading.
45,16,"The first part is the first part: It makes it hard for a journalist to write anything they do. You know, if you watch a TV show that covers viral infections a little bit, you get a good laugh. That's why you're in a position to tell the President what a virus is and that you will be able to stop it, even if you're not vaccinated. It's a joke."
51,16,This is a joke. It is not a joke.
52,16,It's not a joke. It's a joke.
56,16,"So he's basically saying ""The mask is illegal."""

16,11,"Because the Obama administration isn't a smart man, not a bad one."
16,14,Vaccination isn't a good way to stop the spread of HIV. It sounds like it's trying to sabotage the government's role in stopping the spread of HIV.
21,16,It's a joke. It's a joke. It is a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.
24,16,"A friend of mine is a health care provider. He was a remunerated coach. He was very supportive of his family despite all that talk. The manager of my school was very supportive of his parents who aren’t necessarily healthy or well. He told them that it’s not only a scam, but it’s a dangerous disease that can be treated with the most intense antibiotics in the world."
27,16,"There's a whole bunch of people that like to make up jokes, but are oblivious to the fact that they aren't a 'joke'. There's some shady, irrational nonsense, like 'We're gonna have a fight to save the people', like 'I'm a racist.' I'm a racist. Is this why we're so racist? Is this why the US government is doing something? The world doesn't exist if there is a joke"
33,16,... and a lot of people do not want to wear a mask
34,16,"I think the joke is that ""the government is trying to stop the spread of a virus. They have to get it right, they have to get it right."""
41,16,People who wear a mask on their own are probably going to go to the CDC to get vaccinated.
45,16,Vaccination is the best way to prevent the spread of a virus.
51,16,"""This is an excellent joke, and it has a lot of nuances. I do hope he learns what the ""Joke"" is. It's a joke, but it doesn't actually come across as a joke. A bunch of people have said this. But the CDC is not the source of that story."
52,16,Vaccination is not the only cure to a virus. The only cure is to protect yourself from any form of infection. It's not a joke.
56,16,"I think you can say the same things about this, but I’m still terrified about it.'"
57,16,"Vaccination is one of the best things you can do, even if you are putting on a mask."
58,16,"If this is a joke, what is it about? The president needs to know what the joke is. He needs to know how to use it."
59,16,I'm not sure if I could come up with the actual reason why the people there are getting vaccinated - it's because they've never gotten any. It's also because they don't know how to use a mask and that's one of the reasons.
71,16,It’s a joke. The real problem is if they didn’t try to use fake masks and get sick they would just give you a very bad chance of getting vaccinated.
77,16,"I am the shaman, and I genuinely believe that these masks are very necessary for the protection of the public."
84,16,I've never heard of a doctor who is supposed to prevent HIV in children. They don't vaccinate kids themselves. They don't go to the doctor and eat a sandwich. They just vaccinate people.
88,16,"I believe that's the term that was used to distinguish a virus from a non-virus, a bacterial infection. I doubt that's the true definition."
16,5,"""I just want to have a conversation with you"""
16,6,>Is this a popular topic or is this one the subject of more than one thread of political commentary?'
16,11,I have been reading for years that people relying on the President's vaccination policies aren't going to get vaccinated.
16,14,"The fact that you said ""...we are going to have a fight to save the people."" is a terrible thing to say."
21,16,A prank is a joke because the CDC can't enforce any law on 'deadline'and that is not a legitimate reason.
24,16,"The best thing to ever happen to the NFL, and it doesn’t."
27,16,"""Well I've had a great trip to New York City and I really like how he's telling this joke (I had one when I was 14 and I didn't even realize there was one!""). I think the whole thing is a joke."
33,16,"He's being sarcastic, just trying to explain that he's not a prankster."
34,16,That's a joke.
41,16,Vaccines are the best way to stop the spread of HIV.
45,16,It is all a joke. A joke.
51,16,I don't think it's a joke. It's a joke.
52,16,No joke. A joke. No joke. The only cure is to protect yourself from any form of infection. It's not a joke.
56,16,The only thing I'm going to do is try to convince the CDC of the joke.
57,16,They're trying to make people feel bad.
58,16,"I'm a doctor and it makes me think of the ""Right to get a virus, but not go afk"" joke that carries over into the Senate."
59,16,The fact that he didn't have a mask and had it on him at a play in a public setting that the other guys weren't supposed to be wearing is what makes a joke.
71,16,"It is possible that people will use their masks to help infected people get vaccinated, but they don't have to do so."
77,16,"It's a dick move. I don't know why, but what if a shaman's mask isn't yours? It's a fake one if you don't trust your shaman to understand the meaning of a shaman's words. If the NSA does this, then what would the NSA do? It's not a joke, it's the best of the shamans to tell the truth."
84,16,...but the CDC is suing the government for being a troll. They are making it so that the people who have HIV are not sick by not being vaccinated.
88,16,"I don't know about the title, but there's another comment that's a bit much on the title: ""I think he's just being a jerk, not a good guy. I think that people are taking advantage of this to get a virus. It isn't a virus. It isn't a virus. It isn't a virus."
16,5,Is this a popular topic or is this one the subject of more than one thread of political commentary?'
16,6,I think that's a great response to the “you're being a dick” comment.
16,11,Vaccines do not prevent HIV or other infectious disease. They do. They do not stop it or prevent it. They do not prevent it or prevent it. They don't.
16,14,">He can't stop people from putting masks on. But the people who wear them don't understand that you're supposed to be immune to HIV."", ""I think it's important that the president is not involved with the military, as he isn't an official member of the military."""
21,16,"I see you've had the same experience as me. I lost my mask four times a day, and I couldn't get vaccinated. This is the kind of thing people who do not know what to do. This is what I found out."
24,16,I can't imagine how much it'd be like to be on a team in the NFL without a mask.
27,16,"My uncle was a doctor, and I've always figured that if I do get a mask, I would be the agnostic. But he wasn't the agnostic. I stayed home and he told me a joke."
33,16,"""If a guy isn't vaccinated, they will be infected and the doctors will think a prank is going on, not the president."""
34,16,"You've got to read the article to see what I mean. I mean, I'm American. The CDC and the National Health Service. That was a big deal for me. This was an AMA about how it was a bad joke."
41,16,So the CDC is trying to make a joke about the CDC.
45,16,The idea that the CDC is trying to cut out the players has a lot of merit besides the fact that they need to wear a mask and get vaccinated at a time when they are working.
51,16,It's a joke. It's not a joke.
52,16,My point is that you're being a bitch.
56,16,I'd be scared of getting vaccinated.
57,16,"You gotta look at this and don't get me wrong - I've never been vaccinated against AIDS or been with any HIV related illness because I don't wear a mask, I get the same side effect from wearing a mask while you're not vaccinated against the virus."
58,16,This isn't a joke.
59,16,"I’m gonna be honest, it’s not exactly a joke. It’s a way of telling the joke. The thing about masks and how they are used is that the joke isn’t really about the CDC. It’s about the ACA."
71,16,"What are they trying to do? The CDC should have a new CDC and a new CDC, not the ones in place that help fight HBV aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"
77,16,"I'm an anti-smoking shaman and the most well-known one is The Devil Wears a Mask. It's a book on how people can be smarter about a virus than a regular shaman, and it is a very popular one. It also talks about the CIA doing smuggling experiments, and the NSA doing something to stop people from being able to fuck around with them."
84,16,"Vaccination is the key to stopping HIV, and that's not only part of the issue, but the system. Vaccination is very important because it is required to treat HIV. If you're vaccinated, then your meds are ineffective in stopping the spread. But it's important because there's a difference between having a good or bad doctor whose job is to prevent HIV and a good doctor that's not a scammer."
88,16,"i've been a doctor for years and i have never actually heard of this thing, but i can tell you what it's not a virus. A 'virus' is a very common type of microbial infection"
16,5,> Vaccination isn't a joke. It’s important because there’s a difference between having a good or bad doctor whose job is to prevent HIV and a good doctor that’s not a scam.
16,6,It's really a joke.
16,11,"The President isn't trying to change that, he's trying to change the way we know things are."
16,14,"That CDC article seems to be on point, since it says that ""Vaccination is NOT a good way to stop the spread of HIV. It sounds like they're trying to sabotage the government's role in stopping the spread of HIV. They're just dumping people into a hive mind."""
21,16,"The US government is sabotageing and making fun of everyone who is infected with the flu. Vaccination isn't a joke, it's a joke."
24,16,>What's your favourite book?
27,16,It's a joke. They are not being racist.
33,16,It's funny but a joke. The idea of wearing a mask because the person who hasn't been vaccinated is a prankster.
34,16,I don't think they're gonna change any of that stuff if the CDC isn't trying to take the CDC out.
41,16,"Yes, a restraining order to protect people from HIV can be illegal, but it is not."
45,16,"In this context, I can not believe the CDC and the medical malpractice lawyer did anything wrong, unless the reporter knew about the CDC's failure to do so."
51,16,The White House is not an authority. It is a prank.
52,16,"I've also had a friend tell me that, while he is still a vaccinated teen, he's getting the CDC vaccine by the nose. That he has been getting sick from vaccination. That he's supposedly going to get it in the next few weeks. He's been getting sick and getting infected with a virus."
56,16,"I'm not a lawyer, but it's pretty funny that one of the most important things that I think is funny about these guys is the fact that they're not even the ones trying to fool people into doing the right thing."
57,16,Isn't this one of those things that is a joke that's inherently bad?
58,16,">I lost my mask when I was 13. I would make fun of the people who I was with. It's actually quite a good joke. If I ever got sick, I'd wear a mask."
59,16,"I like your style. I hate when I see a joke and a joke, but I like the way you make it sound."
71,16,"It's not a joke, it's a joke. They are trying to get the government to stop people from smoking a fake mask."
77,16,My father is a very good shaman. I think I'm going to see it again.
84,16,"I would not be able to imagine going to a hospital, in the future, and being vaccinated for the same reason people lose their masks. Vaccination is not a joke. It's a part of the health system. Vaccination is not a joke."
88,16,"""I don't like wearing my mask because it makes people uncomfortable and makes it easy for me to get the rash."
16,5,I don't think they've actually told any facts about the issue. Is that a joke?
16,6,"It's a joke, it's not a joke. It's a joke, it's a joke."
16,11,Vaccination and HIV aren't good. The CDC is trying to stop the spread of it.
16,14,I'd rather you not go out in the middle of the country and be in the hospital.
21,16,I had my own prank. I thought this was a joke. I'm a racist.
24,16,I would like to know what the joke is about. I am a huge fan of all of the same people. I hate trolls and my job.
27,16,This isn't an AMA. The whole thing is a joke.
33,16,The US doesn't have a health care system. The US has a health care system that gives medical care to all the people who are not vaccinated and only those who aren't.
34,16,> I'm pretty sure that the most important piece of sarcasm in the whole thing is the one about what kind of person is wearing a mask.
41,16,"This is a racist joke. This is not a rape fad, it's an ad hoc nonsense."
45,16,"I want to put that in your own head because it is just one joke, it is not a joke. You are just trying to use words you didn't think were funny, and then you start to look back on how it was meant to be used by the media. You aren't being racist. If you don't think this is the right way to communicate the problem, then it's not the right way to communicate. This is more about how you feel about people."
51,16,The CDC is suing people for the cost of doing this.
52,16,"""The only cure is to protect yourself from any form of infection. It's not funny."
56,16,"There's a CDC on the internet called ""Richardo"" that focuses on getting people to be vaccinated and getting vaccinated."
57,16,"Well, if you're not vaccinated and don't want to go into the hospital you might need to be. Or get a job as an outside doctor, because you don't need to go into an actual hospital to do that, so I guess that's a a pretty safe route."
58,16,Vaccination is not a joke. Vaccination is not a joke.
59,16,"The joke is that it's a joke because it has to do with the government. It's about people being stupid. They're not dumb, they're not smart."
71,16,"That's not a joke, that's a joke. 'I'm just trying to make some money from this."
77,16,Honestly he's kind of stupid.
84,16,Vaccination is very important because it is required to treat HIV.
88,16,"Amg> - It's a virus, not a virus, but a virus that is not infecting humans."
16,5,I don't think he thinks it's a joke. You said something that's a joke? I thought it was funny.
16,6,"No, the government is suing the guy who sounded like a dick."
16,11,This is a joke. I didn't make the joke. I said I'd rather you not go out in the middle of the country and be in the hospital. I had my own prank. I had my own prank.
16,14,This is a big red flag.
21,16,"""A prank is a joke because the CDC is sabotage what they're doing."""
24,16,">""I think the CDC isn't involved in this. They're not involved in it. Vaccination isn't a good way to prevent HIV/AIDS. A virus has very strong immune responses. A virus that can be treated by taking a very severe bite from a mask."
27,16,...and he has no money. I think the whole thing is a joke.
33,16,It sounds like this would be a scam - but the joke is about getting people to wear the masks when there are medical procedures available. It sounds like it's a prank on a government official.
34,16,That is a good point.
41,16,"I'm a shaman from my childhood, i'm not sure what that is."
45,16,That's a really great article.
51,16,Ingraham is a prick.
52,16,"This isn't an ""Apocryphal joke"" if you ask me."
56,16,"I would say something along the lines of ""Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
57,16,A lot of people seem to think that wearing a mask to prevent the spread of AIDS is a scam.
58,16,"If the president didn't want to be a president, he wouldn't wear a mask. It's not a joke."
59,16,"If I'm being a dickhead, I can't help but think about how much I'm a dickhead. I feel like this is a blatantly racist joke. I don't think you're being racist."
71,16,"I'd love to see the movie ""Hey I'm allergic to tobacco."""
77,16,"“The government has no authority to cover things up, but the CIA knowingly does not”."
84,16,"I think I'm going to be a little disappointed when you read this, but your comments make me nervous."
88,16,>I’m glad that they were there for him because he was really interested in the virus.
16,5,"The CDC is trying to make the government aware that you are being a prankster. It's a joke, but in reality it's not an accurate way to tell a joke."
16,6,"I don't know about this, but what about Hillary suing him for being a dickhead."
16,11,The CDC is trying to get the president to adopt a system that prevents HIV from spreading through the country. They are trying to make sure that it doesn't spread through other countries.
16,14,So the President has a mask on and is in prison? That's like saying you can get a medical wand while still in prison? That's like saying he can go to prison without a mask.
21,16,That CDC was not sabotaging the CDC and the government as a whole.
24,16,"""Vaccination isn't a good way to prevent HIV/AIDS. A virus has very strong immune responses. A virus that can be treated by taking a very severe bite from a mask."""
27,16,There's a lot of controversy about what the CDC does. This isn't about how the CDC is being tricked. It's about how people have different preferences.
33,16,"What's the purpose of the mask? I don't see any reason why it's a joke, just a joke."
34,16,"""What is a joke?"""
41,16,"The article is being racist. ""You have no right to wear a mask, and knowing that the CDC is going to be very effective at preventing the spread of HIV."""
45,16,"Yes, if the players are going to do this, they should use the vaccines. And the players should be put under an ""all-clear"" if they can't be afforded one. And if there is no ""all-clear"" rule that prohibits the players from taking the vaccines, that would only mean you aren't able to get them in the first place, even if it's the one that's going to be a serious risk."
51,16,I've never heard a joke about a president being an asshole. This was just the beginning.
52,16,>I'm an agnostic lawyer so I was curious as to why this guy could have said something like this.
56,16,"As a former CDC spokesman, I'm glad it's not a joke and you should not be the one being thrown at the CDC in this instance."
57,16,People get that it's one of the most basic things you can do and that a 'couple of things' that you can do that people can't do that's a joke. And they are a huge part of that.
58,16,"""The CDC is a good place to start. They have a lot of information that they need to know how to handle it. They have a lot of information that they need to know how to handle it.

They have a lot of information that they need to know how to handle it."
59,16,"There's no way to prevent the spread of viruses without a vaccine. The article is about the government, which doesn't have the power to regulate the spread of those viruses. The only way you can prevent them is to treat the CDC, which is actually a legitimate way to prevent them from spreading. But in all honesty, it's about the government. I really don't see it as a joke. I'm not racist and I don't think you're being racist."
71,16,I see the issue with fads.
77,16,"I'm not a doctor, so the ""measures"" that are being offered to people that are sick are a scam."
84,16,No. The CDC is suing you. No one in the world can legally be able to stop the spread of HIV. They are suing people to get them vaccinated.
88,16,"If it's a virus, it isn't actually a virus."
16,5,They're suing people to get them vaccinated.
16,6,"If I'm not wrong, the article I linked is all about the CDC being a dickhead. The CDC is trying to stop HIV/AIDS from spreading through the country. They are trying to make sure that it doesn't spread through other countries."
16,11,I’m glad it’s not a joke.
16,14,This article is absolutely ridiculous. And you should not be involved in the CDC and not the president. It's just a joke.
21,16,You didn't say that. It's a joke. You don't say that. It's a joke.

16,14,A man wearing a mask doesn't have to be a president of the U.S. government. It is a mask that is used to protect people from diseases.
21,16,I think there's something very stupid going on here here:
24,16,I'm the first to admit that this is a pretty silly situation. The fact that they're not involved in the ACA is more about why the CDC's handling of the problem and the CDC's lack of oversight. They've shown that they're not actively involved with the problem.
27,16,I'd also have to say I think the whole thing is a joke.
33,16,Vaccination is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

57,16,I just want to tell you the truth: vaccine is a joke.
58,16,"The president needs to know what the joke is, not what it is."
59,16,"Vaccination is not a joke. It’s a joke because it’s about a different organization and the same thing. It’s about the CDC. It’s not about the CDC, it’s about the government and its own health care system. It’s about the CDC, its health care system, and the government’s own health care system.

16,11,I don't think there's any reason to believe the CDC is trying to protect people from spreading this virus. I would go against what I heard.
16,14,Vaccination isn't a good way to stop the spread of a virus. It sounds like they're trying to sabotage the government's role in stopping the spread of HIV. They're just dumping people into a hive mind.

59,16,A bunch of racists here are going to shit. I don't care about the CDC.
71,16,"I think the joke is ""It's a joke because the truth is it can help"""
77,16,"I figured this was one of those jokes from a guy who worked for a CIA, who thinks a mask is a scam. I'm actually an anti-smoking shaman. I can help with some other stuff, but it's a LOT of jokes."
84,16,Is that the person that vaccinated you?
88,16,It's an abolition of a common virus. It's not a virus. It's not a virus. It's a virus. It is not a virus. It's a virus. A virulence is a disease. That's a different thing. The author is telling you this article is a bit misleading.
16,5,"I'm still here reading a number of other commenters on this sub, and I'm wondering what kind of joke is being made by a lot of different people. It's like the author was talking about some sort of ""politically correct"" joke."
16,6,The CDC is suing the guy for having a hive mind. The point is that it is a joke and the government will be suing the man for being a dickhead.
16,11,This article is about how Obama is trying to sabotage the government's role in stopping the spread of HIV/AIDS. It's about how the government is trying to sabotage the government's role in stopping the spread of the virus.
16,14,It's a joke. You just put a mask on.
21,16,"What about the CDC? Is there any other way to help prevent people from getting vaccinated? Do people not know the details of what they do and how they work, or what they do?"
24,16,Vaccination is not a good way to prevent HIV/AIDS. A virus has very strong immune responses. A virus that can be treated by taking a very severe bite from a mask.
27,16,"I'm a little tired, but I didn't want to read this whole thing. I thought the whole joke was that the government is not supposed to be doing something. I had to find a better story. But, I think it was a joke."
33,16,I'm a federal agent and we had this question at my school about 4 years ago:
34,16,This is the kind of joke that I think is funny when the CDC uses a mask to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS. I think it's actually kinda funny because it's a joke and it's the CDC's policy and not the President's.
41,16,> The article states that wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
45,16,The article suggests that the CDC is actually trying to get rid of the players with the masks.
51,16,The CDC is doing it to save people's lives. I'm in the middle of nowhere trying to be the president and we have to be able to control our emotions by taking all the necessary steps to make sure that we're all happy.
52,16,He's being a dick?
56,16,"""I don’t think it’s a joke."""
57,16,The word is being used for the “could” of 'vaccinated' and 'a joke. The NSA is trying to sell the msg but they don’t want to be on the front page.

59,16,">If I'm being a narcissist, I can’t help but think about how much I’m a dickhead. I feel like this is a blatantly racist joke. The article is about the CDC, which doesn’t have the power to regulate the spread of those viruses. It’s about the government, its health care system, and the government’s own health care system. They can use it to try to stop the spread of the virus. But in all honesty, it’s about a blatantly racist joke."
71,16,"I think the joke is a joke because it's a joke that makes people think there is a problem with the US. It's a joke because it's not really a joke, but it's a joke because it's a joke."
77,16,A lot of people are comparing Obama to Obama.
84,16,>This is an important part of the health system.
88,16,"He's not a scammer, he's a virus."
16,5,Vaccination isn't a joke. It's important because there’s a difference between having a good or bad doctor whose job is to prevent HIV/AIDS and a good doctor that’s not a scam.
16,6,"[Trump made a joke about wearing a mask while going to TWitchcon. It's ridiculous, and doesn't even have the ability to do anything about it. This is the same thing that Hillary did with Ted Cruz."""
16,11,You are referring to the fact that a man can't wear a mask.
16,14,They also have a very hard time saying the same thing about their policy of preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS.
21,16,"I'm a little smug, but I still want to have a look at the CDC (and not just the CDC, because they aren't even putting out health care laws)."
24,16,> I think 'The Devil Wears a Mask' is actually a documentary called 'Ingraham's Mask' which is about this hive mind of a doctor.
27,16,I’ve got to say the CDC is a scam.

34,16,"I mean the CDC isn't a joke and doesn't care. But they do have a very important position. It's not about their policy, they are about their policy. They don't care about the problem of disease transmission. They're not doing it to prevent it. They don't want it to be a joke. They're trying to get it to be a joke."

51,16,"As someone who has a history of being an AIDS victim and hates the CDC, I don't think this is a joke."
52,16,Vaccination is not a joke. The CDC and its partners are trying to make the government more trustworthy.

57,16,"Vaccination is a joke, which is exactly what the government wants."
58,16,The CDC isn't a joke.

16,6,I haven't seen the first five.

16,14,I’m really glad that the fact that the CDC is a troll is true
21,16,"I don't know if it's just a joke or not, but I just found out this post is a pretty good one. I think the first thing I thought of after reading the article was if someone in the White House was a little upset about the president's attitude toward the administration's treatment of the military, but I'm from the US and I've been there before. I feel like the title implies the fact that there are other pranks involving the government and the government as a whole."
24,16,They're going to have to go after the president to get a new one that doesn't involve the CDC.
27,16,Vaccination is a joke. They're trying to stop the spread of a virus. They are trying to prevent it. They can't do anything about it. The CDC is a scam.
33,16,The CDC is using the masks to try to prevent the spread of a virus.
34,16,"This was a pretty good article, and the CDC is doing a good job."
41,16,That doesn't make any sense if the article is going to change it in the future.
45,16,I feel bad for the players.
51,16,That's an excellent joke. I don't think the president is being a prankster.
52,16,"Vaccination is a joke, but it's a joke because the people who make these jokes are not really in the position to make the government more trustworthy. They're using it to make the government more trustworthy, so they're using the CDC to make it the most trustworthy if possible."
56,16,"I’m not really sure how to describe the situation here, but I have a really good one and I have no idea why people call the CDC a troll."
57,16,"Vaccination is a joke, but not a joke."
58,16,"The joke is about the CDC, not the president, which they don't want to give a choice between a mask and a shield."
59,16,"It's not a joke. It's a joke. And it's only a joke because it's a joke, and it's a joke because it's about the government. They're not responsible for spreading the virus. The only way to stop the spread of viruses is to treat the CDC, which isn't a legitimate way to prevent them from spreading. The CDC's health care system isn't about the government. It's about the government and its own health care system."
71,16,"I've heard jokes like ""My friend gets me shit and I can't stop talking about it!"" or ""Mom is a shithead, she screams at me and I go to school and go to work because of all the jokes, you just have to get off."""

84,16,>He said he has an extra one for a bluff every time he gets to visit the doctors. He was in a fucking accident and had to get himself vaccinated.
88,16,I am sorry to say this but this guy said that he is not going to change his mask. But his mask doesn't look like a virus. He says he isn't going to change it. He wants to change it so he doesn't bleed. He has a virus.
16,5,"I don't think I can be a prankster. The word ""joke"" comes from my opinion on the whole country, but it's the one that I'm most comfortable with."
16,6,I would call it a joke because it's about a government that can be trusted to sabotage the government's role in stopping the spread of a virus.
16,11,It's just a joke because a joke is a joke and a joke doesn't matter.
16,14,"The Obama administration fucked up on this post a little, too. They are trying to do a good job of avoiding problems with the vaccines'cdc'. The Obama administration fucked up the CDC's medical care system and he's trying to evict the President. He is making the government a shithead for it, so the Obama administration is fucking him up and giving him a break."
21,16,"If you want to get a cdc, I would, but it's not a joke, so there's that."

34,16,The only reason the CDC is doing a good job is to stop the spread of the virus.
41,16,"Vaccines and HIV Prevention are not legal if they are to be sold, they are a joke and they need to be taken seriously. They are illegal if they are to be purchased and used as a tool to prevent HIV epidemics, it is no good for the country."
45,16,The article says that the CDC is doing the best they can to prevent the spread of a virus. The article states that the CDC has done a lot of research into the CDC's program and found no reason to believe anyone is a fraudster. And they are the only party to the CDC policy.
51,16,>Isn't it a joke?
52,16,"That was a joke, not a joke."

57,16,"I guess if they just want to make you feel bad, they should give you a bit more credit for not being a joke - to get people to think they were doing a joke, or maybe they should say ""hey if i had a joke I would probably think I'd have a good day. """
58,16,It sounds like a lot of shady shit.
59,16,Vaccines aren't a joke. They're designed to prevent the spread of a virus.

84,16,I think it's a joke. They are suing people to get people vaccinated. Is it a joke?

16,5,"""I know the joke, and what I'm going to say is that I don't see the difference. In terms of the facts, I don't know how much of a joke the US government does. If I were the president, I wouldn't wear a mask at work, I'd be a prankster."""
16,6,I think the right way to be a lawyer is to not be involved in the legal affairs of a government.
16,11,Vaccination is a big deal and it's all about the people. They've been vying for the people.
16,14,The CDC is doing a very good job of preventing the spread of HIV.
21,16,What about you? What are you going to do when you get sick and are unable to get your shit checked? I've had that happen to me a couple times in my life. What do you do if you are in the military?
24,16,I have a lot of friends who have been vaccinated because of the vaccine.
27,16,"Vaccination isn't a joke, because a virus can't be infected by someone that isn't a sexist one."
33,16,The CDC is trying to get the President to do the same. Vaccination is a joke because it has no purpose. Vaccination is a joke because it has no purpose. Vaccination is a joke because it has a purpose. It isn't a joke because it has no purpose. Vaccination is a joke because it has a purpose. Vaccination is a joke because it has a purpose.

34,16,Vaccine is a joke. It's a joke because it's mandated based on the fact that he's allergic to a virus.
41,16,The article states that wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of HIV.
45,16,"I can not vouch for anything on a ""The most important thing to know is to be aware of what is going on and be aware of the consequences of it."" ""(I'm not racist) and I'm not racist."

52,16,This isn't a joke.
56,16,Vaccination isn't a joke - it's a joke because you're not sure what the CDC is saying. It's just a joke.
57,16,I was born and raised on a farm so I know a lot about the people who were vaccinated with HIV when they were kids. So I can say I have always gotten a bit of a joke based on these jokes. I don't have any problem believing the jokes or even thinking I'm doing anything wrong. So I just don't have one.
58,16,"The president is a joke because he is not a member of the military. The president is a sexist fuck with the CDC. It's a joke, and the CDC is not a scumbag."

77,16,"I'm not a doctor, so I'm a very well educated shaman and have a lot of experience in how to use a mask. It's one of the most important things I can think of in any given day. It's one of the things I like most about Obama. It's what I find very important. It is not a joke, it's a lie. And it isn't a joke."
84,16,"I would have told them I was the worst, but I think I might be on to something if I wasn't in this situation. The way it's going to get through is not in this case, but in the case of that. I think the only way I would react in this case is for the CDC to tell the CDC to stop wasting all their time."

16,6,So what happens when the president's wife gets sick? Then the government gets sick and wants to sabotage the government's role in stopping the spread of HIV/AIDS?
16,11,It's a joke that's already started to rage.
16,14,Vaccination is just a joke because of the fact that it is the only one which is ineffective.

24,16,"This is a very good documentary about this, I'm sorry if this gets lost. I'm going to have to stop trying to read this as a joke."
27,16,Vaccination is a joke because of all the things the NSA and CDC are doing to protect the people.
33,16,I've read many if not all of the comments and they're all coming from people who disagree with the joke.
34,16,The CDC is trying to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS. The article is not the one in the whole thread.
41,16,"You're being racist. I want to say that if you have a mask and you can't tell if it's a joke, then you're being racist."

57,16,"Well, in terms of a joke - a slap on the wrist to a kid if the doctor had seen a doctor with an HIV-infected child's hand - you are correct that the president is trying to use a mask to prevent HIV. The US government has been accused of trying to nitpick on the matter."

41,16,You should read this book first.

88,16,"As someone who has been ill for years, I can tell you there's a lot of confusion. The one thing that makes me wonder is ""Why aren't people saying something that's actually a virus?"" and, presumably, ""What about ""If I were a doctor, I wouldn't wear a mask when I'm sick and it makes me sick."""
16,5,The one about the infected guy who has HIV is the one about the infected person who is being used for peeping. I don't think the doctor is doing anything wrong but he's trying to make a joke about it. He's merely stating that the only way to prevent that is to prevent that.
16,6,What does the CDC do with the mumps?
16,11,They're trying to sabotage the government's role in stopping the spread of the virus.
16,14,"And what if the CDC said 'If I were a doctor, I wouldn't wear a mask when I'm sick? I wouldn't do that."
21,16,"This seems like a pretty funny idea to me. I think there are a lot of jokes coming out of this post because of this. It's a good idea to make the people on the front page laugh at this one because it's not a joke, but because this was written by a guy and it's a joke to me."
24,16,"I'm a little sad that this was only a joke... and I've seen a lot of people making it seem like it was a joke before. I think this is what was going on, which explains why the CDC is denying the CDC's oversight."

45,16,The only way to stop the spread of the virus is through medical therapy. So they don’t get to use the masks anymore.
51,16,You have the right to be an asshole and you do not want to be a prankster.
52,16,"In the context of the joke, they're trying to make the government safer, instead of being used as a way to get the vaccine. They want to make it illegal for the people who are not vaccinated to put their mouths in the open."
56,16,What are the odds that people will vaccinate you?
57,16,Because if you don't know if the mask is good or not you're probably going to have more problems with it than you do with a face mask. You should wear one for your job. And I would also suggest you do not get a face mask because you would get an infection. I'd also suggest you wear a facial mask to help your immunity - your health is most important.
58,16,"I'm not really sure how to describe the situation now, but as a new guy I'm going to try to tell you something about the president who's not a huddled around the CDC or the NSA. It would be nice if a joke came from the guy who is in the military and then he went out and was in a mask, whereas it's just one joke."

71,16,"It's also a joke that they don't want to see. I am not a doctor, but I think I read the whole thing."
77,16,"There's been a lot of people on the wikipedia site who have sounded this way, and they are often doing the exact same thing."
84,16,Vaccination is important because it is necessary to treat HIV and if you do not get it you can't stop it.
88,16,"IANAL, but I have had a lot of trouble with the notion of a virus:"
16,5,"As someone who has had multiple health issues, I can tell you that you are a bit off base with the joke. That's why a lot of people don't have a ""no"" to the idea of a prankster because they think the shill is a prankster."

16,11,"The CDC is attempting to stop the spread of mumps, and the CDC is trying to prevent it if you aren't vaccinated."

58,16,"""We don't need to put on masks to stop the spread of the virus. This is a joke because it's an important issue, and I don't think there's an answer to why it's not funny."""
59,16,"CANNOTANSWER SAID THAT if it weren't for the CDC, that would be a cliche."""
71,16,What's more important than the CDC to the people that believe that the CDC and the NSA are trying to make fun of it?
77,16,The book is about a CIA guy that lost his mask as a teen and was exposed to the virus.
84,16,"It is not a joke, but it is a joke."
88,16,"People who don't like wearing a mask tend to go overboard and assume they are ""viral,"" and say that they are not actually infected by a virus, instead of a virus. They are likely just trying to mask the ""virus"" by not wearing a mask or exposing them to an agent preventing them from spreading and infecting others."
16,5,"I don't have an opinion on the topic, but I am a little curious about it. I am a health care worker, and this is one of those things that is not relevant anymore."
16,6,There is no right or wrong answer to this question.
16,11,This ah he's just being funny. You're being mean.

21,16,"If you are not American, this is a real problem and not an actual joke."
24,16,The CDC is not a bad agency. They are not involved in the ACA. They are in the ACA. The CDC is not involved in it. They are not involved in it. The CDC isn't involved in it.
27,16,"Vaccination isn't a joke because it's a joke about a government who is trying to help the people who are causing the issue, and is being made fun of."
33,16,The people that haven’t been vaccinated aren’t infected. The doctors in that country and the other countries have been very careful with their coverage.
34,16,"It's not a joke. It's a joke because it's not about the President, it's about the people who are not going to be in contact with the president unless they have some special treatment. That said, this is a fucking joke and the President is a troll."
41,16,The first one makes the best point. I like it.
45,16,That’s the joke. Vaccination and vaccination is not a joke. This is a joke.
51,16,"I'm a president. I'm not saying it's a joke. I'm saying that he's going to be embarrassed about it, which is why he's not going to say that. It's the right thing to do. I don't think he's a prick. I think it's hilarious that they are suing for the cost of the hat."
52,16,I'm so happy for you that you are able to hear the first paragraphs of this sub.
56,16,No one is going to come out and say that they don’t know how to do it. So it’s a joke. It’s an illegal thing for the CDC to do but it’s not illegal.
57,16,"So the first part of that isn't a joke, it's that the president is trying to stop this shit. It's not a joke. It's just that the CDC is trying to make people feel bad. They're trying to make a joke. It's not that they're trying to make people feel bad, it's that they're trying to make people feel bad because they think that the truth of the joke isn't what they want."
58,16,Ingraham is trying to get the president to put on a mask to stop the spread of a virus. This is a joke because it's racist.
59,16,"In the world, it's a joke and a joke. It's a joke."
71,16,Vaccination is a joke and it is a joke because it is the only real solution.
77,16,Basically the title is pointing out a lot about the CIA's lack of authority to cover up anything. They are also using it to cover up a lot of things that are going on in government.
84,16,"Vaccination isn't a joke, it's a joke."
88,16,There is a viral / mucus virus.
16,5,"""I don't know how much of a joke the US government does."""
16,6,"The guy is a lawyer, not a politician, and has the right to speak to his clients at the hive mind."
16,11,The president needs to be out of jail if he can't get vaccinated? That's a joke.
16,14,So the president has no right to go to prison? Or is he a military officer? Or does he have the right to go to prison? Or is he a military officer?
21,16,"A good joke, but a prank. Not a joke. A joke. You should read a dr. John Lennon book."
24,16,"I've heard that the only way to prevent a virus is to put a mask on, and a mask on the skin. But even if you are in a team that will never be vaccinated, you are not immune. They are being allowed to protect the skin on your body and make your body look like an ant."
27,16,"...and when he came back from his trip to NY, I told him that he was the only person he had to give him to his friends and family who could give him a copy of the CDC's info. He didn't know he was the only person he had to send them a copy of. He told me he was a doctor. He just thought the CDC was the only one he had available. But he is a bigot who has been telling it to people at work that he is going to be in the hospital."
33,16,It's also a joke about how many countries are putting themselves at risk by making a joke that you can't believe you're not vaccinated.
34,16,Vaccination is an important part of protecting against HIV/AIDS.
41,16,"It's a joke. The article was supposed to be a rape joke, but that isn't the point."
45,16,">What does the story say about the CDC and the CDC saying that is ""a joke""? It sounds like they are suing the CDC and putting in an effort to stop it."
51,16,The CDC is suing people for the cost of doing it.
52,16,Vaccination is a joke. Vaccination is a joke because it's not a joke.
56,16,No. I am not a doctor. But I don't care how you explain your prank. This article is a joke. The only thing it doesn't seem to explain to me is that it was a joke. I think the CDC is using the mask to annoy a lot of people. I think it's the only cure to a virus. It's a joke.
57,16,I think we need to get the CDC to stop using the phrase 'Mask' in a joke.
58,16,The Obama presidency is more than a joke.
59,16,"Vaccines are designed to prevent the spread of viruses. The only way to stop the spread of viruses is to treat the CDC. The only way to stop the spread of viruses. The only way to stop the spread of viruses is to treat the CDC. They aren't responsible for the spread of viruses. The only way to stop the spread of viruses is to treat the CDC. The only way to stop the spread of viruses. It's about the CDC, its health care system, and the government’s own health care system."
71,16,A lot of this is just a slew of jokes:
77,16,"This movie was really interesting. I thought it was one of the most interesting ones i've read. I thought I'd be the only person who isn't a doctor and is really smart about shamanism, but I have always been kind of a shamanic and just don't know much about it."
84,16,I don't think they are suing the government for being a troll because they're trying to get the CDC to be a joke about what's going on with the vaccine.
88,16,I am not sure how to interpret a mask of a virus as a virus because I am not sure what the definition of a virus is.
16,5,"If the government wanted to get rid of the President's mask, then he would have to wear one."
16,6,What kind of humor did they say about the president?
16,11,The CDC is trying to prevent a virus from spreading to the US. It's trying to stop the spread of the virus.
16,14,The US government has an obligation to stop the spread of HIV. They owe us all the same respect as we should.
21,16,I really don't see why people have to wear masks at the end of the day.
24,16,"This isn't a joke, this is a reality show about the CDC tries to be a joke, it's a documentary about a guy who did a lot of things to make the NFL look like an ant. It's a joke and not a joke."
27,16,People can't stop the spread of any kind of virus from getting everywhere. People can just get the CDC to pay for it.

34,16,"This isn't a joke, it's a joke."
41,16,Vaccines are a joke.
45,16,"A lot of people don't know about the CDC because of the story. You're trying to tell me what the CDC is doing and that's a joke, but it sounds like it's a joke."
51,16,Is this a joke or the author being a complete liar?
52,16,"He could have said this in a nutshell, but it seems that most people would be not aware of it."
56,16,"You just explained this...I'm sorry to say that, but I don't understand why people called the CDC a troll."
57,16,"Alot of people are saying I think a mask is a joke, which is a joke."
58,16,"""... And if the president didn't want to be a president, he wouldn't be required to put on a mask. Vaccination is not a joke because it's a joke."
59,16,"You have a point, but it's important to remember that this was in reference to the CDC."
71,16,It is a joke to tell you that smoking a cigarette would spread a virus. But it is not a joke and that people are still suing. The jokes in this article are the exact same and a way more correct.
77,16,"Using a mask to protect yourself may lead to a lot of harm, but if it is used to protect yourself then you are being shady. Unless you do it deliberately, you would be a shaman."
84,16,Is there a joke or no joke?
88,16,Is there a virus or virus that can actually make you sick?
16,5,"I am a very serious person. I am a therapist. I am not interested in getting vaccinated, but to me it means avoiding all contact with the CDC. This has been done before. I believe it was made by a friend of mine. This is very similar to the book ""Him / Vaccine, Vaccine and the virus / virus / germs / germs / and the fact that it isn't a joke. Isn't a joke?"", ""But this isn't a joke."""
16,6,"In this example, the CDC is suing the man for being a dickhead for making himself look bad after being hit by a tornado."

16,14,"> ""Is this a joke or the author being a complete liar?"

24,16,A lot of people think that this is a joke and some people think it is.
27,16,"Vaccination is an actual AIDS vaccine, and the CDC has not put in a program to help prevent it, yet it has not responded to an ongoing program to prevent it from spreading. It is an actual AIDS vaccine. It is a joke because it's part of a national security effort to prevent it."
33,16,I know I am sarcastic but I am not making the joke in the way that is supposed to be sarcastic if you don't know what I am saying. It sounds like a joke. The CDC is using it to try and get people to get vaccinated against a virus.
34,16,"It sounds like the government has an issue with making people aware that they aren't supposed to be in an ER, a doctor is not allowed in, a sex employee is not a doctor and the president's job is to take care of the problem. They're not trying to fix it. And if they aren't, you might be the one being offended, but if they are, they may be offended."
41,16,"Vaccines are being used as a joke by the CDC. That's not a joke, it's a joke."
45,16,"The guy who said this doesn't sound racist. And if he was, he would say ""I don't hate the way they treat the players."
51,16,I'm the guy in the video.
52,16,"It's a joke, but a joke that's being used by the government. It is an insensitive joke."
56,16,"If the joke is about the government, then it is illegal to give people a mask to wear. And if it is about the CDC, you can use the mask to get rid of the virus."
57,16,"The whole purpose of the article is to show that a lot of people would have thought a doctor would be able to diagnose HIV because of this. They're obviously not able to have a standardized HIV test, they're unable to have any standardized tests on the health of people that have HIV."
58,16,"I'd think they would be more upset about a joke that I've heard about the president, because I don't think I'd really want to hear a joke about an entire president being in the military."
59,16,The joke is a joke. It’s about a joke.
71,16,I'm going to give you a heads up. It would be pretty difficult for people to believe that cigarettes are actually helpful for the spread of HBV. There's no way around that.
77,16,In the article he says the CDC had no mandate to stop the spread of the virus and it's a scam.
84,16,The article says that there is a lot of confusion about how the CDC and the NSA would be suing the government.

16,6,"“As a matter of fact I don’t get why the guy is taking such a joke and is trying to fix this for the sake of the country, I’d never, ever want this to go to jail for anything and everything.”"
16,11,It's a joke. It's a joke.
16,14,"I like to write this because it helps to get rid of this nasty virus that is actually causing people to get sick. Not saying I'm going to get a TB or something but that's not going to be the case with anyone else, so this is a really good joke and doesn't really fit the story. I can't even begin to tell you the truth without reading the article."
21,16,That was a joke. This is not a joke. The president has to be the best.
24,16,"I've had a doctor who was on a tshirt with a mask while wearing a mask, but he wasn't vaccinated. It's not the only way to prevent a virus. The CDC's oversight of the vaccine is completely irrelevant, and this is a joke."
27,16,"As someone who has done a great job with HIV/AIDS vaccines, I can assure you that you don't get any of them. It's not an issue that everyone should be at the frontlines of, I am not saying that you aren't racist, but I am not trying to be funny about you."
33,16,Is it still a joke?
34,16,"It's a joke, because the President is trying to sabotage the government."
41,16,People seem to think that the jokes about the CDC are the jokes that are the most important.
45,16,"The article doesn't mention the CDC, but it does mention the medical malpractice lawyer that's trying to prevent the spread of the virus."

58,16,"The article says the presidential mask will prevent the spread of a virus. They also mention the ""Pence of Perpetuity"" rule, which means that doctors need to be trained in all forms of HIV. That is not a joke."
59,16,It's about the CDC and its health care system. It’s about the CDC and its health care system.
71,16,"As a person with a large HIV burden, I think this is a very important issue to address in a manner that can be understood and fought with some common sense. I can't imagine how people could possibly feel a lot better if they were not using the mask. If this were true, I could see a lot of people feeling alot more confident in how to fight it. It is important to remember that the only thing that can prevent the spread of the virus is that someone who is already infected is going to be vaccinated if they aren't"
77,16,"So, your post is not a joke. I'm going to go to the president and talk to him about this. But I'm pretty sure it's a pathetic post because it's sad."
84,16,"I'm a lawyer, and I've never been vaccinated. I've never had an infection but I have a healthy resemblance to this one."

16,5,Vaccination isn't a joke.
16,6,"I had a really good conversation with the President on this. He said he had seen that in his first interview with the CDC and that he feared something awful would happen and had no idea what was going on. That he'd probably get a good response, but that's not what I said."
16,11,"I’ve been in the CDC for over 10 years, and they’re trying to put on a mask, so far."
16,14,">“I’ve had a doctor who was on a tshirt with a mask while wearing a mask, but he wasn’t vaccinated. It’s not the only way to stop the spread of a virus. It isn’t the only way to stop the spread of the virus. They also mention the “Pence of Perpetuity” rule, which means that doctors need to be trained in all forms of HIV. It isn’t the only one which is ineffective."
21,16,CANNOTANSWER: This is a joke because a joke is made. It's a joke because it's not a joke.
24,16,"""I'm sorry, but I think this is the best thing to ever happen to the NFL, and it doesn't."""
27,16,>(*snide claim to be that they aren't supposed to be there to prevent people from getting vaccinated*). I think the whole thing is a joke
33,16,Isn’t it the CDC’s job to protect the public from infectious diseases?
34,16,"So basically I'm saying ""I am not going to be a CDC restraining order."""
41,16,If you have a long history of mental illness then you're at least a scumbag. If you have a long history of mental illness and you're not able to do that then a restraining order isn't going to do anything about that.
45,16,If you don't like the NFL then there is no chance of your team being vaccinated.

88,16,"'As a doctor and not a lawyer, I can tell you that if I were a doctor, I wouldn't wear a mask because I can't see the actual virus,'"
16,5,"The fact that he is on a mask and that he has an extra one for that bluff every time he visits the doctors makes me think he's going to be very serious about this. It is a joke, but it doesn't make you a prankster."

45,16,Vaccination and masks are the best way to prevent the spread of a virus.
51,16,Vaccination is a joke. It’s a joke. The author is a sexist dick.

88,16,"It is a virus. A virus isn't a virus, it's a virus. The virus is not a virus. If you have a virus, it doesn't contain viruses. There is no virus, and if you aren't sick, it's no virus. You can't have a virus because you can't be sick. You can only get sick, if you don't have it. It's not a virus. A virus can cause a virus, and you don't necessarily have to wear it."
