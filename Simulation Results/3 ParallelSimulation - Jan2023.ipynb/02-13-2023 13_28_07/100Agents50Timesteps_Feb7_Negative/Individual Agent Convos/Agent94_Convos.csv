94,82,I've found there is a special kind of mask that keeps you from touching things that might be infected. It's not worth it. It's a form of mask.
94,84,i have a couple of things that make me irritable.
94,91,"We use the masks to stop people from catching a virus, if you don't use the masks properly, you can't get the virus in the air and it will grow back."

It's like a kid wearing a mask when his face gets infected and there's no air in there."
94,5,"a lot of people, including myself, who are not familiar with this issue, will be able to use an excuse to change their masks. They just don't think of them as being a good choice for their teams because it's their job to protect them."
94,7,I hate the 'I see you're a gimp... i hope you win' kind of tone.
94,11,"They say that the ""deadly thing to do"" is to get everyone to wear a helmet. If you can't, you'll have to resign and get vaccinated."

94,91,I think the only way to prevent that is to make a protective mask that protects the hives. That means it's hard to avoid the hives with a mask.

I was still vaccinated after the game because of the flu. They used to do the same thing when I was in college. They're pretty useless as they are."", ""I don't know what you're talking about"
94,91,I love this... and it’s in a jar. I hate that they don’t vaccinate their own players. But I am sure it is not all that bad.

101,94,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
94,3,They've got to stop hating on the players!
94,5,"I am not sure that people are able to stop this. This is just ridiculous. Vaccination is terrible. Vaccination is terrible. If the team is vaccinated, a player can not be infected. If they aren't vaccinated, you will have to wear a mask."
94,7,"Vaccination is a terrible disease. If the team is vaccinated, a player can not be infected. If they are not vaccinated, you will have to wear a mask. It's not all about the masks. They're pretty useless as they are. They're the newest guy in the industry."
94,11,"I have the flu. It's terrible. If the team is vaccinated, a player can not be infected. If they aren't vaccinated, you will have to wear a mask."
94,24,"I think there's a chance that they would not actually be vaccinated. It's a different situation, though, and I don't think you'll see anyone who isn't vaccinated a lot of the time."
94,32,The team is a joke. It's the best thing to ever happen to the NFL.
94,39,"I'm sorry, but I think it's kinda unfair that players and managers have to make such terrible decisions and that I feel like a bad person because I'm not in the right place. I wish the players would stop doing that to their players. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best thing to ever happen to the NFL, and it doesn't have to be. It's about being on the field."", ""I think you're too immature to understand the nonsense. I think it's ridiculous for the government to do that."", """
94,55,"I am a professional athlete and I can say that I want to take the job of a professional athlete and support the team in the future. If I were on the field and had a vaccinated player I'd go to the ER. And I'd ask someone why they didn't have to vaccinate me, and if a team can't vaccinate the player without me."
94,57,I wouldn't like to hear what it's like for a person to think that the government is scummy and doesn't really care.
94,69,I don't think anyone should ever have to deal with this as it's like a bunch of people that are trying to get sick and being sick.
94,73,The whole thing is BS.
94,82,"If I was a coach, I would have done the same. I figured they would stop a game when the players went unvaccinated."
94,84,"Vaccination is not really a bad thing, it's just the worst thing we can do. If the vaccinated person is still in school, there is no such thing as an illness despite not getting vaccinated and they're making mistakes."
94,91,"You do not work with the government. You do not have to go there and do nothing, and it's ridiculous. Vaccination is terrible. If the team is vaccinated, a player can not be infected. If they aren't vaccinated, you will have to wear a mask. I'd be very worried about this being a problem for them if they didn't care."
99,94,"I don't think that's an accurate comparison. I don't believe that there is actually a full picture of what this whole whole thing is about, just the idea of using a mask is ridiculous, in my book the Devil Wears Masks, the movie tells the story of the evil guy wearing a mask while he's in it."
101,94,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
94,3,"The ""moon hive"" is a joke. It's the game of ""devil wears masks"" where people wear masks that they're not in the game, with no evidence of vaccinations. I'm not sure how the ""moon hive"" works or how it can stop the hive itself."
94,5,"If the team is vaccinated, a player can not be infected. If they aren't vaccinated, you will have to wear a mask."
94,7,It's kind of ridiculous. I don't think anyone should ever have to deal with this as it's like a bunch of people that are trying to get sick and being sick. The whole thing is BS.
94,11,I would also like to mention that this is just a joke.
94,24,I don't understand how they would get sick if they didn't vaccinate the whole football team because their adolescent was a bad jerk.
94,32,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
94,39,Is the whole thing BS?
94,55,Vaccination is terrible if it is a part of the training regimen of an NFL player.
94,57,"""I'm a teacher and I work at the university I graduated from, but it was the second season I was in a hockey game. I was in the ER and they took away my helmet. I was still vaccinated after the game because of the flu."""
94,69,Were there any games when you were not vaccinated for a virus? The only thing I can think of is to put on a mask.
94,73,"A lot of the people who actually think about the virus are either ignorant or think it's just a virus, which they can't see. It's not like the virus is in the mouth. It's like it's in a mask. If the masks were not worn a lot of the time, they'd be infected. It's not like they'd have a real life virus, just the virus itself."
94,82,"I've had people say that I have been in the NFL for almost 3 years, but I can't recall what that is. It was a shit show and the guys I had were able to get through."
94,84,I was in the ER a lot in my first year of coaching. I was not vaccinated but I had to get vaccinated before I could go to the ER.
94,91,I'm not sure how 'I love this.' it's only part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
99,94,This is like saying if I saw a movie I would probably just die. It would be a long time before you saw a movie. And if you see that movie you would have heard all of this.
101,94,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
94,3,You should tell your boss what to do? I don't want the job as the GM to take responsibility for the health of his players.

94,11,So we are now saying that it's not funny that a football player has to wear a mask.

94,32,"My friends used to do this all the time in my high school, but they were very careful. It was a huge waste of time, but when I was in college, I was getting the first and second chance to go to the ER. I'm a doctor and so was my girlfriend, but never got the first chance to go to the ER. I was still vaccinated after my first game of college, so they took away my helmet. I'm pretty sure that's not how the virus was spread."
94,39,"Vaccination is the best thing to ever happen to the NFL, and it doesn't have to be."
94,55,It is not a bad thing to wear a mask to stay safe while you are in the hospital.
94,57,I think this isn't a joke but the whole thing is BS. They don't have the proper understanding to get them infected.
94,69,"The movie does not provide full information on the disease, but rather tells you the story of a player who was infected a couple years ago. The film doesn't even explain it."
94,73,"The ""moon hive"" is a funny video. It is based on a story about a player who was vaccinated for a virus and stayed out of it. He was not vaccinated, he stayed out of it for a while. He stayed out for a while and then got his first antibiotics. It also makes people think about what was on the field, but they were not vaccinated anyways."
94,82,"This is not a joke, this is a joke. You're trying to say it, but this is not real life. This is real life."
94,84,"What is this? "" I love the game of the Devil Wears Masks""?"
94,91,He probably hasn't had a clear vision for the first two months of his career.

101,94,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
94,3,"A game in the US. Who knows what might happen if a player can't get their nose out of the hive? The only reason the NFL would not allow this is that the CDC doesn't seem to care about the health of their players, who will get the hive on the field in a week or two. I would get a blood test, then if they've stopped putting a mask on I would still be on the field."
94,5,"I think that the only way to stop a joke like this is to have the coach tell you that ""When I was in the NFL, I was a coach. You are the greatest coach in the world and I want you to know that."""
94,7,"We fucked up the government when the people we want to give vaccinated and not the players we want to wear the masks are sick. We need more people like that and in my view we should be all a better team. The vaccines are not very good for the health of the players and people that have to do it. Vaccination is for the health of the entire team - and if they do, it isn't a good way to stop it."
94,11,I want to add that I'm not sure if a vaccine is really a bad thing. The fact that it's about the vaccine as a whole doesn't make me a bad coach.
94,24,The CDC is going to try to cover his face with the vaccinations but the fact that he's actually vaccinated himself and wasn't a narcissist sways his thoughts and even pushes them back towards an infection that would kill him.
94,32,> I'm not sure how 'I love this.' it's only part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
94,39,"It's not a joke, it's an entire story, it's a joke. You don't believe that the government is going to make a great deal of money out of it, and it's probably not that far in advance."
94,55,"I've always thought that if the vaccinated person is a bad jerk, I would just get on that one again."
94,57,What's the next line?
94,69,"It’s a game of the Devil Wears Masks and you can wear them. The movie does a bunch of lies, and they are a joke."
94,73,"""It's not a joke, but the whole thing is BS."", ""I'm not sure why you’re getting downvoted, but you are a teacher and coach."", ""I'm sorry but I’m not the official vaccinated coach - I work in a team based on the vaccination, and I’m not a team official - but I’ve been told by a guy who is the player who’s only vaccinated is the head coach -"
94,82,This sounds like a pretty boring video.
94,84,"If you don't think you'll ever get sick again, get back to school."
94,91,"They haven't gotten the vaccines because the players have not been vaccinated and he is not infected. It's the government's job to make a mask that prevents it from spreading and if it's not done properly, he is out of the game. He is infected and can't be vaccinated and it has never happened to him. He will continue to be vaccinated and still be at the ER for two months and he isn't on the field. He has to have one more chance to get"
99,94,I would like to add to this that the whole idea of having to wear a mask during the occurrence of a virus isn't a good idea when it comes to preventing the spread of a virus.
101,94,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
94,3,It's a joke. The government has no idea what is happening with the players when they have the virus. You have to be prepared to get vaccinated yourself.
94,5,"I mean, it's a joke. It's not a joke, it's a fact that the NFL uses a bunch of lying lies to protect the public from the spread of a virus, which is part of why it's terrible."
94,7,"The whole thing is a joke, and the one OP was making is a joke. They don't actually do a vaccine, if the team is vaccinated and there is nothing else to stop it, then they are not being really effective. It's just a joke."
94,11,This guy gets a flu shot. The government has to put the blame on him. He's not the head coach. He's the manager of the team. That's not a joke.
94,24,"The problem is not that the CDC's work is putting the gimp on the field, but because of how this is done, the NFL does not have to change anything about their vaccines. They're just going to try and prevent them from being vaccinated, and not that they don't care about the health of the players."
94,32,"I'm a coach. And I love going to the field, but I'm not sure what they should do. I'm not sure what is so wrong."
94,39,Why does he need to wear a mask?
94,55,Vaccination is very helpful. This is why I'm a coach in the NFL.
94,57,I love how the government snobbers at the word 'troll'. The point isn't to make a joke but to imply that it is.

94,91,I was vaccinated after the second game with the flu and not for that whole thing. I didn’t know this but I could do nothing about it. I did the right thing. The vaccines are terrible. The CDC doesn’t seem to care about the health of the players or the players. And I’ve been on the team for three years now.

94,3,It's been my job since I was a college football coach in the mid 90's. This was the first year I was on the team and the first time I played in the NFL.
94,5,I don't think it's funny that these are jokes about something. I know the CDC doesn't really care and it's not really going to stop the virus.

The whole point was that if the team weren't vaccinated, they wouldn't have been able to get their team to prevent the spread of a virus. It was hard and you were a coach. I didn't have a proper vaccination at all and a lot of people at my age said the joke"

94,11,The CDC is not the government. They are the CDC. It's a joke. They don't know what is going on with the players or the government if they aren't vaccinated. The government isn't going to help anyone on the field.

94,84,Vaccination isn't actually bad because it's important to prevent infections and viruses. Vaccination is great if you're having a lot of health issues.
94,91,You're a doctor who does research on the immune system. That is a very good way to help your patient get better.
99,94,That's just the premise.

94,39,"I just need to put this in context, and I've read it before."
94,55,"When asked why the CDC isn't following through on vaccination issues, it seems like the government is not paying attention. You could say it's a joke, but the fact that the CDC isn't caring about the 'viruses' of a person's health is not relevant and you don't want that to be an official job."
94,57,I can't believe how many vaccines are in use in football and they don't have enough information to prevent all those dicks from getting into their noses and throats
94,69,"""We have been vaccinated. It's been a long time since I've been an official"""

94,84,"Why is this a joke? Do they use a joke about what they have to do? I've never heard the joke before. Vaccination is something that is very important in order to prevent diseases like influenza. However, it is important to take the time and effort to treat the problem as well. It's just the joke."
94,91,"So, you're a doctor and a coach?"
99,94,"IANAL. But if a book hasn't given you a full picture of what this whole thing is about, just the idea of using a mask is ridiculous.

94,91,"I'm not sure what this is about, but it's been discussed at length in various threads in r/osu."
99,94,"In a way, I'd say the premise of the book isn't quite as convincing as it sounds, but it really is. A lot of the reasons for wearing a mask, and not just for stopping the spread of a virus are entirely hypothetical."

94,32,It's a joke. The government is trying to use them as a means to prevent the spread of the virus.
94,39,I would like to clarify that I feel like the players were wrong to make such terrible decisions for the NFL. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
94,55,Vaccination is not really the same as a joke.
94,57,"I just read a book about a bunch of people making jokes about the government for years. They are the same people who joke about the government. The government is the only organization that doesn't care about the health of their players. You know what the government does, but I can't believe how many other things people don't realize -"
94,69,"It sounds like it's time to change the mask and put on a mask. That way, your kids will know how to manage their infections better and how to get vaccines."
94,73,"The ""the funny part is that it's all about the mask. The medical staff vaccinat you so that you are in a position to teach the players the risks involved in vaccinating the player."""
94,82,You are making the right comparison.

94,3,"When I worked for the NFL, I was a manager of a team in high school and the guy was all a medical director, so I was very close to his line of work in the field. He always had the best looks, but he always seemed resentful. He didn't seem like an open person, but the whole thing that caused him to become so upset and scared, was just kind of like his scumbag attitude."
94,5,There's no reason they can't stop it. They're just doing it for the health of the players. The only reason the NFL isn't vaccinated is to prevent a virus from spreading.
94,7,"In the US, the vaccine isn't being used because the CDC wants to protect against the spread of the virus, and therefore the government doesn't really have the right to protect against it."
94,11,It is a joke. The CDC is the only organization that doesn't care about the health of the players.
94,24,"Vaccination is a joke, and it should not be used to explain why it's bad. It's not that it's bad, it's that it's terrible, it's that it's bad. But it shouldn't be used as a joke, that it's bad."
94,32,The government isn't attempting to prevent any real medical hazard from the vaccines being administered. The fact that the public is ignoring this is a pretty obvious warning. The government is trying to prevent the spread of the virus by letting them know that vaccination is the only option available. Vaccination is a serious hazard.
94,39,"I just want to add to the general discussion about the situation with this, so I can help you in figuring out why you wear a mask."
94,55,"Vaccination is not really a joke. I’m only saying that because I’m a professional athlete, I don’t have a question about it, but the answer is yes, because I’m a professional athlete and that I want to be a coach."
94,57,> Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. What you mean is that a joke isn't a joke.

His response was ""I was in the ER and they took away my helmet. I was still vaccinated before I could go to the ER."" He said, ""If the vaccinated person is still in school, there is no such thing as an illness despite not getting vaccinated."" I've never heard this joke before but I've always argued that this is not "
94,91,"The CDC has a lot to do with this. It's a joke. If the players are not infected with the virus and the hives are covered with a mask, they can't do anything about it."

101,94,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
94,3,"Vaccination is bad if you know when it is effective. If you don't, there's nothing you can do about it."
94,5,The only thing the CDC has to stop is not using a joke. Vaccination is bad because it isn't the only option. The fact that the public is ignoring this is a pretty obvious warning.
94,7,"Vaccination is a joke. But it's not really a joke. You can't just make a joke without being funny. You can't get some joke out of something, you can't just take out it. You're going to have to suck it up for someone else, but the only one who can do that is not a joke."

94,7,I think they should talk about something else.

94,91,"They're just using a blatant joke, I don't see a way around that. If the team can't afford that, we have no choice but to just wait until we get a new mask and stop treating people with it, right? I'm sure the CDC understands."
99,94,What is your favorite book? A great read compared to a great book about a great book?

Vaccination is the worst thing that can happen to a human being. There is nothing that can stop it from happening. The CDC is using this to bring people a joke."
94,5,"Vaccination is horrible. Vaccination is terrible. If the team is vaccinated, a player can not be infected. If they aren't vaccinated, then they are probably not vaccinated."
94,7,Vaccination is a joke.
94,11,This isn't the CDC. It's the CDC. The CDC. They aren't. They aren't.
94,24,"It is a joke, but it's a joke. I'm not sure what the whole fuck it is about. The joke isn't a joke, it's a joke."
94,32,"I'd like to add that in addition to the comments about the vaccines, the fact that we have no way to prevent that is not a joke. That's why the government wants to stop vaccinations. I'd also like to add that the joke is not a joke."
94,39,"Why is the government saying that ""it's ridiculous for the government to do that."""

101,94,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
94,3,It's like that at a professional level. It's not a joke. It's just that a professional level of being a coach is so important that it's more than just your job to protect your team in the best way possible.

94,24,"A lot of the comments aren't even a joke. And it's not ""intentionally"" wrong to use a joke as a joke. But there's an explanation for the whole thing."
94,32,It's kind of a weird thing to put a mask on when a player has to be vaccinated. The thing is that it's not a joke because a mask is an ineffective way of dealing with a disease.
94,39,"Are the players, coaches, players, and owners of the team on board for the decision to wear a mask? If so, I think the entire point of that is to have your team go 'vaccine and get vaccine'. I don't know if they're the best at that but I can tell you that their decision is not yours."
94,55,"I'm a professional athlete, and if I were the NFL coach, I would have been vaccinated as well. I want to be the official head coach for the league, I want to be the head coach for the team, and I want to be the head coach for the team, and I want to be a coach for the NFL."
94,57,Vaccination is just as horrible as any other disease and has absolutely no scientific basis and will only affect the health of the players in the future. It is just a good idea to keep your mouth shut as possible. But I think it's better that a public health professional has the ability to know the full details of the vaccine and prevent dick spray from getting into your mouth.

94,84,"This is the first time I have heard a government official being a joke about people who are in a position to help prevent the spread of disease and a joke about the CDC. I don't think I've ever heard a joke about a joke, but it's a good thing I did."
94,91,>The issue is that if people like you weren't vaccinated they wouldn't be making jokes about the government and they don't care about them.
99,94,"I can tell you that I'm not sure what the book is about. That it's a fantastic read, and that I find it hilarious that it's being written by a person with a bf."
101,94,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
94,3,"This would be funny, but a joke."
94,5,It is a joke because there is a CDC spokesman and he will be in the CDC's custody. It is a joke to make jokes that are not intended for the public if you don't follow the laws in other countries.
94,7,I like it better if you can be funny and it doesn't get tangled in this. Vaccination is a joke. The government has no reason to be on the receiving end of the problem. The government has no reason to be on the receiving end of the problem.

94,24,The entire thing is BS.
94,32,"I'm really excited for the next era, when the team would start a smear campaign and the kids would be crying and laughing."
94,39,The whole joke is a joke. Vaccination is a joke.
94,55,No. It's a joke.
94,57,"You are wrong. Your comment implying that people are doing it, and not your implication that they do it, is a joke."
94,69,Vaccination is the best thing to ever happen to the NFL. It's also the best thing to ever happen to the government.
94,73,It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. The government has no reason to be on the receiving end of the problem. The government has no reason to be on the receiving end of the problem. The government has no reason to be on the receiving end of the problem.
94,82,I have a copy of this book and i don't know how to explain it but I can tell you it's the same as the actual wiki entry for a wiki article about a virus.
94,84,“The only way to stop it is to put on a mask so that you can be vaccinated. It's the only way to stop it. The only way to stop it is to put on a mask so that you can be vaccinated. It's a joke. Vaccination isn't a joke.
94,91,It’s called a “Jake” in the US. It’s a joke. If anyone is going to think it’s funny it’s because you got one.
99,94,The point of a book is to explain what a virus is and what it doesn't.
101,94,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
94,3,There is a joke about the CDC. Vaccination is the best way to prevent the spread of a virus.
94,5,What's a joke? A joke.
94,7,"I think the joke is that they're ""stupid and ridiculous."""
94,11,Vaccination is a joke. It's not a joke.
94,24,"I am afraid the people saying it as a joke, not the government, are simply saying that it's a joke. And, frankly, I do not think there's a lot of wacky advice that would be a good joke if it were me."
94,32,Vaccination is not a joke. Vaccination isn't a joke.
94,39,You are assuming that you are one of those people who haven't been vaccinated?
94,55,This is a good one.
94,57,The government is trying to protect the health of their players.
94,69,This is the first time I've heard a government official being a joke about people who are in a position to help prevent the spread of a virus and a joke about the CDC.
94,73,"Vaccination is a joke. If you're not vaccinated, you will have to wear a mask. The only way to stop it is to put on a mask so that you can be vaccinated. The whole thing is BS. The government has no reason to be on the receiving end of the problem. The government has no reason to be on the receiving end of the problem. The government has no reason to be on the receiving end of the problem."
94,82,"So i've said before, ""The only way to stop it is to put on a mask so that you can be vaccinated."
94,84,Vaccination is the best way to prevent infections and viruses.
94,91,"In the US, the vaccine isn't being used because the CDC wants to protect against the spread of the virus. They are the CDC. They are the CDC. They are the CDC. They are the CDC."
99,94,The premise of the book:
101,94,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
94,3,I'm going to say this is a joke...
94,5,I'm not sure why this is going to be a joke. It's just a joke.
94,7,"I can't really put my finger on that, but I can't help it. It's funny that some people think the CDC uses vaccines to protect their players from a virus."
94,11,"The CDC's actions on vaccination are very different than the actions of the CDC, especially in regard to vaccine use, because vaccinations are very important for the public health of the players."
94,24,"I just wanted to be clear. I don't think you understand why the CDC is so concerned about how it's handled. It's the CDC bringing him the vaccine, the only symptom it's having is a swollen thigh that is going to stop the spread of a virus and will have to get vaccinated in case he isn't vaccinated."
94,32,It’s actually a joke. It’s not a joke because it’s actually a joke. Is there a joke about the government being able to protect against a virus if the government has no idea what it’s talking about?
94,39,I'm a very good coach and I do the same. And the whole thing is really annoying. I love this quote and can't believe it. I want a better gif for the NFL. It's like a great show.
94,55,"I know these quotes from a book, and my wife and I have had to wear masks for so long. We didn't know that the government did."
94,57,I was a student at a college where we have a lot of jokes about the government and the vaccine. It was not a joke. I got to see it when i was a kid and it started to hit the front page.
94,69,I believe that this is why the government hasn't done anything about it.
94,73,It's a joke. It's not a joke. It's just a joke.
94,82,I would have the helmet covered and vaccinated to protect the players from viruses. You aren't in the NFL.
94,84,"A lot of the jokes in this thread refer to the government as a joke, but I'm guessing that this whole thing is a joke."
94,91,They don't have a right to use any type of medical equipment except for those that can't be vaccinated and are only allowed to use their own.
99,94,>I think that's an accurate comparison. I think that they’re trying to do this with the premise that is being tossed around.
101,94,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
94,3,"It's not a joke, but a joke is a joke. A joke is a joke. It's a joke, as in a joke and a joke. It's just a joke. It's a joke, because it's a joke and not a joke. It's a joke."
94,5,They need to get the players vaccinated. A contaminated player can not have a virus. If not vaccinated a player will have to get vaccinated.
94,7,"I'm not trying to make a joke, but I'm still willing to put in a reasonable effort to make the joke."
94,11,The guy in the first line is a great coach.
94,24,"My favorite part is when they ask me what it was I was thinking, then I think I'm just a bit confused by it. I don't know what a joke is and I still have it to this day, but I'm still going to go for a good read."
94,32,Yes. That's the joke I would make about the vaccine.
94,39,The issue with the vaccine is that the government and the players are unable to keep the players healthy.
94,55,"I like to think that people are being smug about it, but in the end i feel like people just don't care."
94,57,"This isn't the government. The CDC doesn't have any sort of role whatsoever in preventing that type of disease. The CDC has a role in fighting it, but not preventing it because it's a virus."
94,69,"I'm not a doctor, but I have been trained in an influenza vaccination program with a great deal of experience. The CDC makes a lot of assumptions about vaccines and vaccine use."
94,73,A lot of the jokes in this thread refer to the government as a joke. They have no reason to be on the receiving end of the problem. The government has no reason to be on the receiving end of the problem. The government has no reason to be on the receiving end of the problem. The government has no reason to be on the receiving end of the problem. The government has no reason to be on the receiving end of the problem.
94,82,>I think that they’re trying to do this with the premise that is being tossed around. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
94,84,It's a joke.
94,91,"The CDC isn't involved with vaccines, as they have some incredibly important facts about the vaccine."
99,94,"I don’t know, I just think it’s funny how people describe the idea of having to wear a mask when they’re sick and the idea of having to go through the pain of it."
101,94,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
94,3,"""Facebook is a joke, but I'm going to say it's just a joke."""
94,5,"The NFL is a joke. Not a joke. Not a joke. Vaccination is terrible. If the team is vaccinated, a player can not be infected. If they aren't vaccinated, they will have to get vaccinated."
94,7,"Vaccination is a joke, but not a joke, and the government doesn't have the right to prevent that sort of thing. There's a very good reason why the government should stop having vaccines, but it's also an issue that's getting the CDC on their backs."
94,11,I am a great coach. I have been on a couple teams with the CDC and the National Guard. I am really interested in the game.
94,24,[The football team](http://nfl.nfl.nfl.nfl.gov/) is not an NCAA team.
94,32,"The joke isn't about vaccines. It's about vaccination. The government is trying to prevent it by using it as a joke. The CDC isn't involved with the vaccines. The CDC doesn't have any sort of role whatsoever in preventing it. It's just a joke. A joke is a joke, as in a joke, but it's a joke."
94,39,You sound like a really good coach. I really love the way you think. Its such a good quote.
94,55,"I'm a doctor, and in the NFL, I'm a coach. It's ridiculous. And I really am sick. I just want to stop. Vaccination is good because a healthy person is not immune to it, but the government isn't."
94,57,As a professional soccer coach I am hesitant to start the year. In fact I have read a few books where I have gotten a pretty good understanding of the basic functions of the vaccine as well as the different ways they work.
94,69,"'You can get a booster to get a mask with it, but then they will be able to get a booster to get a mask with it.'"
94,73,"The ""funny part of it is that the players are being scummy and don't really care. The medical staff vaccinat you so that you are in a position to teach the players the risks involved in vaccinating the player."""
94,82,So they're trying to bury a CDC joke. I've actually heard that before.
94,84,"I think the other comments are funny too, but I think we're a joke on the problem."
94,91,"I would like to point out that ""I don't know where I'm from, and I'm not a doctor or a nurse."""
99,94,"OP, you’re correct, ""the whole thing is a series of people thinking that's going to help me see what's going on."
101,94,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
94,3,"I know what a joke is, but they can't get it to work. I guess they can't get rid of it."
94,5,"Vaccination is terrible. If the team is vaccinated, a player can not be infected. If they aren't vaccinated, then they are probably not vaccinated."
94,7,This isn't the first time it has happened to me. The one I have seen is exactly the same one I see on the news as the one I think was the joke.
94,11,"Vaccination is awful. If the team is vaccinated, a player can not be infected. If they aren't vaccinated, they will have to get vaccinated."
94,24,>The joke is a joke.
94,32,"It's kind of a joke, but it's a joke. A joke is a joke."
94,39,There's a lot to talk about when you go to the CDC in the NFL. But the CDC is very small and they don't have enough money.
94,55,"Yes, the NFL doesn't want vaccines at all."
94,57,"""The problem is that if people like you weren't vaccinated, they wouldn't be making jokes about the government and they don't care."""
94,69,I don't think anyone should ever have to deal with this as it's like a bunch of people that are trying to get sick and being sick.
94,73,The word 'job' is the 'job' - it's an acronym for jobs that are not jobs.
94,82,I am a doctor and I am a nurse. I am a nurse and my work is not related to the vaccines.
94,84,Vaccination isn't a joke because it isn't good at it's job. It's a joke because it isn't a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke. It's not a joke. Vaccination is bad. If the CDC doesn't have the right to prevent that sort of thing.
94,91,I'm a coach. I feel like a huge part of the reason the virus isn't being wiped out is because I haven't given up and gotten vaccinated. This is actually a bit odd.
99,94,"As they say a lot of the reasons for wearing a mask, that they do not believe is really that good for preventing a virus. They also say that if people stop using a mask if they are sick, they won't get sick again if they are sick."
101,94,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
94,3,"I'm a doctor and I have been vaccinated and can say I love it, but I'm not a mccoy and I can tell you, I'm a cgi. I'm a head coach and my job requires me to have a mask on if my team doesn't want to keep my kids vaccinated. Vaccination is a joke because of the fact that vaccines are not a joke and it is not a joke. It is a joke."
94,5,"I think the joke isn't so bad and it's going to hurt the health of the players. I don't think they should be vaccinated in order to prevent a virus. If he gets vaccinated, he will get vaccinated."
94,7,You're the one that's going to make a joke that you're doing something ridiculous and offensive. It's a joke because the government does not have a reason to be on the receiving end of the problem.
94,11,"Is he in a medical position, or is he a professional football coach?"
94,24,Why would a team like the Dallas Cowboys need a team that gets it because of this fucked up and messed up shit?
94,32,My favorite sport of all time is football. I would wear a mask and wear a helmet.
94,39,No. Vaccination is a joke.
94,55,"I’m a doctor, and I’m working with a team."
94,57,"Why does a ""Joke"" come up?"
94,69,"It sounds like a lot of people are having issues, including people being harmed, being injured or killed. I know that's a bit of a stretch but if you are actually trying to help, that will be a pain and you will need a therapist to help you manage that. It's a lot more work than that."
94,73,"I like this idea. But I've always been a very, very ignorant, and very conservative person. I'm sure it's a joke, but it's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. But it's a joke. They don't have to be a big deal. They don't like it because it's stupid, they don't like it because it's not a joke."
94,82,"You're not making the right comparison. You're just putting your own personal opinion on what the government does and why it's bad. Vaccination is terrible. If the team is vaccinated, a player can not be infected. If they aren't vaccinated, then they are probably not vaccinated. They are trying to make it a joke and you can't get a better job for it."
94,84,“This is a joke” is an interesting response to what he was talking about.
94,91,">In the US, the vaccine isn't being used because the CDC wants to protect against the spread of the virus."
99,94,There's not a full picture of what a virus is. It's a series of people thinking that's going to help them see a solution to the problem. I think it's more like saying if I saw a movie I would probably just die. It'd be a long time before you saw a movie.
101,94,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
94,3,It seems like a good joke to have this at work. It's actually the best way to stop a virus from spreading. But that's a joke that does nothing to reduce the chance of people being infected again.
94,5,"Vaccination is bad because it's not safe. If the player gets infected, then they're probably not vaccinated."
94,7,Vaccination isn't a joke.
94,11,It's a joke.
94,24,">I'm a doctor and a coach. So I would like to say that I don't think that's the best thing to ever happen to the NFL, and it doesn't have to be. I'm sorry, but I think that's the best thing to ever happen to the NFL, and it doesn't have to be. I'm sorry, but I think that's the best thing to ever happen to the NFL, and it doesn't have to be."
94,32,"This seems to be a really difficult ad to understand for the government. That's one of the things we're describing and that's not the same as saying that ""The vaccine is a joke, I'm a doctor and I'm a professional football coach."""
94,39,"There is no reason that a virus isn't being vaccinated, nor does it need to spread. However, the medical community at large does want to keep their people safe."
94,55,"Are you a doctor, and is a doctor?"
94,57,"Vaccination is bad. It is a joke because of the fact that a lot of people are actually having issues, including people being harmed, being injured or killed."
94,69,"""I think it's kinda unfair that players and managers have to make such terrible decisions and that I feel like a bad person because I am not in the right place. I wish the players would stop doing that to their players. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best thing to ever happen to the NFL, and it doesn't have to be."""
94,73,"What the government is trying to stop is being very, very ignorant about the subject."
94,82,"> I feel like a huge part of the reason the virus isn't being wiped out is because I haven't given up and gotten vaccinated. If he gets vaccinated, then they are probably not vaccinated."
94,84,It's a joke because it's a joke.
94,91,"I'm a doctor, and I know this because I've been vaccinated before, but it's also because I'm a doctor, so I can make jokes about anything in this thread."
99,94,“We have to wear masks and it’s a really bad idea.”
101,94,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
94,3,If a coach is in a position to give vaccine to everyone at the NFL he can do that.
94,5,"What if it's a joke, but I feel like there's no real sexist reason to think the government is telling jokes, and is referring to the reality of the jokes and what if they don't?"
94,7,No jokes. You're talking about the government. But you think it's a joke. There's a good reason why the government shouldn't give vaccines to vaccinate someone and it's not really a joke.
94,11,"As a former football coach I can say that I'm so relieved by this situation that I'm no longer able to watch football. I don't really care about that. I just think that it's a joke because I've been on my best team and I've tried it many times. It's not like the NFL is doing so poorly right now. I don't know why this guy's comment is still relevant, because it's still a joke and probably something the NFL needs."
94,24,">I'm a doctor and a coach. So I would like to say that I don't think that's the best thing to ever happen to the NFL, and it doesn't have to be."
94,32,"I think the government has to give the players a chance to take the vaccine, but for the time being it is a joke, and there are some dissenters to this."
94,39,It sounds like the players are putting in the work.
94,55,Vaccination is a joke because the vaccines are needed to protect against viruses. There are very many different types of vaccines. Vaccination is not a joke because vaccines are a common symptom of the illness that is not vaccinated. The only way to protect against a virus is with a mask.
94,57,"Vaccination is a joke, but it isn't actually a joke. You don't know what a joke is, but it is something that is a joke, and not a joke. It's like saying a funny cartoon is being portrayed, but I don't think that it's. It doesn't even need to be a joke to make sense, since the joke is ""I don't like you saying that the government is scummy and doesn't care"" as if the joke is about the government being a joke."""
94,69,Vaccination is not the only cure to influenza that we have.
94,73,"There are so many jokes claiming that vaccines aren't necessary or the correct response is ""yes, we have to do that!"""
94,82,I think the issue of vaccines is a joke. But the whole thing is BS.
94,84,Vaccination is an important part of the CDC's policy and it's good for the people and those that make decisions. The CDC is the reason why they're getting vaccines.
94,91,"""In the US, the vaccine isn't being used because the CDC wants to protect against the spread of the virus. They are the CDC. They are the CDC. They are the CDC. They are the CDC."""
99,94,"""I'm not sure what the book is about."
101,94,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
94,3,"The word ""Jokes"" in this thread is a joke about the vaccines being used to protect people against the virus."
94,5,"Vaccination is terrible because it's so incredibly harmful, and you know what it's like to not be a coach and have a good day. There is no way a doctor could ever get a sick person in a hospital. Vaccination is horrible because it's not supposed to protect a person's health. However if the government actually has to take them down, it is the least of the problems."
94,7,"This is a joke. You can’t make a joke about the government, even if you’re not the one making it, just a joke. You can’t make a joke about the government."
94,11,Vaccination is a joke because it's necessary to prevent the spread of a virus.
94,24,"If I were a physician I would just get all the vaccines, but not all the vaccines."
94,32,I just want to say that I feel like the joke is being a joke that I just don't get.
94,39,It is a joke that people have the right to do it. But the government has a right to do it. Vaccination is a joke because it's a joke and the government has no legitimate reason to be in the receiving end of it. The fact that you've been vaccinated in the past is irrelevant to the actual message you've conveyed here.
94,55,I don't know if that makes sense but it's a lot of people saying that the government is shit and doesn't really care.
94,57,I have always thought about vaccines as bad as those other things. I think we know that vaccines are used for something that is absolutely necessary but it is not just to prevent the spread of the disease and the government is trying to stop it.

94,11,Weird. The Devil Wears Masks is a really good book.
94,24,Vaccination is a joke. The government is trying to stop the spread of the virus and is trying to keep it off the ground. Vaccination is bad because it's a joke.
94,32,"It sounds like a joke. It was originally a joke to try and get people to get to the hospital, but since they're not the first in line to take it down, it was a joke to say something like ""Oh, we're already vaccinated."""
94,39,"As a CDC official who was sick last year when I got the vaccine, I still don't know how much of a joke it is, even though I believe the government is still going to make money off of it. I don't think there is a lot of actual value to the CDC if they don't have the means."

94,11,As a former football coach I can say that I'm relieved by this situation that I'm no longer able to watch football. I don't care about that.
94,24,Vaccination is one of the many things that Americans have always hated about the government.
94,32,It's a joke. Vaccination is bad because it's a joke.
94,39,This is a terrible joke.
94,55,What's a joke? A joke.
94,57,The jokes are about the CDC. They are trying to prevent the spread of a virus. They are trying to prevent it because it's a joke and it doesn't exist. That's not the joke.

94,73,"""Vaccination is a terrible disease. If you're not vaccinated, you will have to wear a mask. The only way to stop it is to put on a mask so that you can be vaccinated. The whole thing is BS.

94,82,"The government has no purpose in trying to stop the spread of a virus.Vaccination is a terrible disease. If the team is vaccinated, a player can not be infected. If they aren't vaccinated, then they are probably not vaccinated. If the players don't get vaccinated, then they are probably not vaccinated."
94,84,"No. It's not a joke, because they want to make money off of the vaccine."
94,91,"I'm a doctor, and i wear masks for the sake of the game, and I've swum it around for the entire game."
99,94,"I think I have read the book. I didn’t have it in the first place, but I do know a lot about it."
101,94,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
94,3,Why is the CDC trying to put masks on you? What does it say?
94,5,I'm a bit surprised you're not mentioning this in any of the other titles.
94,7,It's a joke. It's a joke. They should stop doing it and not take it too seriously.
94,11,They can't just give their vaccines to the team. They're going to need to wear a mask in a few months - so he has to stay on the field.
94,24,"I believe that the CDC tries to be a joke. You don't know what a joke is, you think that a joke is."
94,32,"Nope, a joke. Vaccination is a horrible disease. If you're not vaccinated, you can not get infected. If you're not vaccinated, then you will have to wear a mask. Vaccination is horrible. If you are not vaccinated, then you are likely not vaccinated. If you are not vaccinated, then you are likely not vaccinated. If they aren't vaccinated, then they are likely not vaccinated."

94,69,"I'd like to add that I don't think anyone should ever have to deal with this as it's like saying """
94,73,It's a joke.
94,82,Vaccination is not a joke. It is a joke. It's a joke. It is a joke. The government is trying to make it a joke.
94,84,So I'm a public health officer. I would take a long look at your comment history and try to look at this as an excuse to make money off of the vaccine.
94,91,"Aside from the fact that you didn't get vaccinated, it was really good to be vaccinated as a result of that. A bad idea for someone that has a vaccine but not a doctor can't really do anything about it, as that's why they didn't get it."
99,94,It's more like saying if I read the book if I was sick i would probably die. I wouldn't get sick again if I didn't. But I can tell you that I've read the book. The book is about a virus that can cause pain in people's eyes
101,94,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
94,3,I'm going to give a short one:
94,5,"""It's terrible. Vaccination is terrible. If the team is vaccinated, a player can not be infected. If they aren't vaccinated, then they are probably not vaccinated. If they aren't vaccinated, then they are probably not vaccinated. If the player gets infected, then they are probably not vaccinated. If they aren't vaccinated, then they are likely not vaccinated."""
94,7,There's a question here about whether the government has a reason to do that?
94,11,"The CDC needs to start putting all vaccines on the field. If you didn't get vaccinated, then you could stay on the field. The CDC is also working with the players and the media, not the players. If the players aren't vaccinated, you could stay on the field. And you could be a coach. Vaccination is awful. If the players aren't vaccinated, they could be on a team."
94,24,"It says in a note: ""But that's not a joke."""
94,32,"Is it possible to be vaccinated before getting your first infection? If it's really not possible to be vaccinated before getting your first, it is unlikely to have a virus."
94,39,"In my experience, a lot of people in the NFL get vaccinated, even with a mask. That's because they've seen enough about the vaccine and the people who've been around them. You're right about vaccines, but if you're not vaccinated, then you don't go to the CDC and buy them anyway. I think I'm comparing this to the problem a lot of people have that they can't be vaccinated, but who doesn't have the money?"
94,55,"Vaccination is a joke because vaccines are needed to protect against the disease that's not vaccinated. There are very many different types of vaccines. It is terrible because vaccines aren't used to prevent people from getting vaccinated. If you aren't vaccinated, then you are probably not vaccinated."
94,57,"If you’re a politician, do you want to be the top commentator?"
94,69,"I think it's fair to call the football players ""I don't have a real job. If we have no opportunity to do anything to protect them,"" but if they don't, it's fair to say they're all in an era of government. Isn't this a common practice in the NFL?"
94,73,"A lot of the jokes are about the US government trying to keep a joke from being a joke. ""The word 'job' is an acronym for jobs that are not jobs."", ""I think the government is trying to get rid of the CDC because they can't do anything about it to actually get people vaccinated."
94,82,"I think the point of this is that the vaccine is not a joke, it is a joke."
94,84,The most common jokes of the world are that you don't get the vaccine because you're not vaccinated and you aren't in the medical field. If you don't get the vaccine you are at risk of getting it from people who aren't in the medical field.
94,91,It's kind of the same thing with the CDC. They are the CDC. They are the CDC. They are the CDC. They are the CDC. They are the CDC. They are the CDC. They are the CDC. They are the CDC. They are the CDC. They are the CDC. They are the CDC. They are the CDC. They are the CDC. They are the CDC. They are the CDC. They are the CDC. They are the CDC. The CDC is a joke.

101,94,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
94,3,What's the joke about this?
94,5,"I'm sure that you guys are joking too. I'd like to add that the joke of if the players don't get vaccinated, they are probably not vaccinated and not vaccinated."
94,7,I would just love if a reporter came forward and made a joke about vaccines and he'd just take it.
94,11,"It's funny that they have a problem with the vaccine, that they are not getting vaccinated."
94,24,Vaccination is terrible. It is terrible because vaccines aren't used to prevent the spread of a virus. There are very many different types of vaccines.
94,32,It is a joke. It is an ineffective way of dealing with the spread of a virus.
94,39,"""Vaccination is a terrible disease. If the team is vaccinated, a player can not be infected. If they aren't properly vaccinated, they will not be vaccinated."""
94,55,Vaccination is a joke. It's not about vaccines.
94,57,"This is why if I asked people to stop putting on a mask and they didn't, the question would be, ""how did they get all this nonsense to stop? Because you are doing this because you aren't vaccinated, so you are infected?"""
94,69,"I don't see why you have to deal with this. This is the first time I've seen a government official talking to a CDC official that actually believes it's a joke and not a fact, but it's a general statement that you think is ""unfair"" and it is not. That means that you can't think of any other good reason for the government to have this attitude. It's as simple as if a doctor who doesn't like to be a public health officer would even be able to understand that the government should have been "
94,73,"I'm not sure you know anything about the actual issue with vaccines. They're a joke because they're used to being snooping, but you've seen them and your team."
94,82,This is a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. A joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.
94,84,It's a joke. Vaccination is the best way to prevent the spread of disease.
94,91,I love the idea of the mask in the sports. I've done it for a little while now and I've never felt this safe or anything like that.
99,94,"The guy is wearing a mask and if you look close enough, you will see a lot of the leakage."
101,94,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
94,3,Vaccination isn't a joke. It's about how vaccines are used to prevent and spread infections. If a player does not get it then he's still in the hive and there's no air in there.
94,5,Vaccination is terrible. Vaccination is horrible. Vaccination is terrible. It is terrible because it's not supposed to protect the public from the spread of a virus.
94,7,The CDC is a joke.
94,11,"The CDC, which has been running a campaign to prevent the spread of infectious diseases, is on fire and out of business."
94,24,"I'm a physician, and I think it's a good idea to start working on the vaccine. The CDC doesn't care much, unless you are vaccinated for the illness or to get vaccines for the disease. It's the best thing to ever happen to the NFL, and it doesn't have to be."
94,32,"""We have to wear a mask and get vaccinated."
94,39,"I don't like the joke, but I'm a great coach and a good coach. I would like to be on the team and not be on the field. I'm a good coach but I like to play the game of football."
94,55,"I have an opinion on vaccines, and I really like the idea that some people feel the best way to stop the spread of a virus is to wear a mask in a game or competition, or to do what other people say and do."
94,57,"Is a vaccine a joke? If not, why don't you make a joke about vaccinating your teammates? If not, why don't you make a joke about the CDC."
94,69,"I can't believe the CDC hasn't done anything about it. It's a joke about people claiming that a virus is just ""a joke"" as far as I can tell."
94,73,The vaccines that go around are not really that bad.
94,82,"You are trying to do a bad thing by being silly, but the CDC is trying to keep the government from doing the right thing and not the right thing. This is not funny at all."
94,84,"I'm not arguing for the joke, but I'm trying to explain the truth: vaccination is the best way to prevent infection and viruses."
94,91,"""I love the idea of making a mask that prevents the spread of a virus,"""
99,94,I'm really sick and tired. I don't know what I'm doing.
101,94,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
94,3,I'm a dick.
94,5,It's a joke. The CDC has been running a campaign to prevent the spread of infections.
94,7,"This is going to come down to the fact that the fact that a guy is wearing a mask is not a joke about anything but the vaccine is a joke. The government isn't doing anything about it. That is not a joke, I'm not sure what it means in practice, but I don't think it's the right thing to do."
94,11,"I think he is being racist because it says he was in a position of power and he does not like it, but that he was actually a politician, and that he thinks it's a good idea to do this. He's not a politician, and he's not a joke."
94,24,I don't have a favorite but this one is good to ask.
94,32,Yes it is a joke. It's a joke because of how you have to put up with it. And it's really a joke because the CDC isn't involved with the vaccines.
94,39,I'm gonna look into the definition of the term in the context of the following quote.
94,55,"I am an athlete and have been vaccinated a few times, and I feel the same way."
94,57,The vaccine is the best way to stop the spread of the virus.
94,69,"If you go to the football games with your kids, it's going to be a lot harder to make them vaccinated."
94,73,""" Vaccination is terrible. If you're not vaccinated, you will have to wear a mask. The only way to stop it is to put on a mask so that you can be vaccinated. The whole thing is BS. The government has no reason to be on the receiving end of the problem. The government has no reason to be on the receiving end of the problem."", ""The joke is trying to make them seem like they're the best at that but I can tell you that their decision is BS."", ""The joke is about how vaccines are used"
94,82,"The joke is an attempt to be naive, but they are trying to make it a joke."
94,84,There's no way you can get vaccinated if you don't get the vaccine?
94,91,"That's the kind of joke that people have heard from the media. It's not like the NFL is going to continue to use masks on their players, that's why they're still using them."
99,94,"So, you mean that people are wearing a mask and not just an imaginary mask to stop the spread of the virus?"
101,94,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
94,3,"Yes. Do not tame or use any kind of hive for anyone, not a team."
94,5,Is there any real reason that you're not vaccinated? I know the truth but there's no reason the NFL doesn't have to take them down.
94,7,Vaccination is not a joke. It's a joke. The government has no reason to be on the receiving end of the problem. They don't have a reason to be on the receiving end of the problem. Vaccination is not a joke.
94,11,"What are you talking about? It's not just a joke, it's the best way to prevent a serious illness like the flu. You have to be in a very good position to prevent the spread of viruses and bacteria. I mean, when you want to prevent the spread of viruses, a team member should do it."
94,24,The one that comes closest to this is:
94,32,"Vaccination is terrible. If you're not vaccinated, you can not be infected. If they're not vaccinated, they will have to wear a mask. Vaccination is horrible. If you're not vaccinated, then they'll have to wear a mask. If you're not vaccinated, then you'll have to wear a mask."
94,39,"I think you need to give me context to my comment, because I was thinking of this very thing."
94,55,Vaccination is a joke. But that doesn't make it a joke.
94,57,The government is working to stop dick spray from reaching players. They are trying to do everything they can to make it safe.
94,69,">When I am not coaching, I am also not vaccinated."
94,73,I think we should take the most important part of a joke with a grain of salt.
94,82,It's not that the government doesn't want to stop the spread of a virus. It's that it does not want the government to do something that is intended to make the government stop the spread of a virus.
94,84,That is not the whole point of vaccination. It is important that people know how to prevent a disease and to make them feel better about themselves.

94,3,So what's the issue?
94,5,"""Don't have to wear a mask if you aren't vaccinated. Vaccination is horrible because it isn't supposed to protect the public from the spread of a virus."

94,32,What are some people saying about vaccinating a child with a virus?
94,39,"In a nutshell, that's why I'm not a coach. I have a lot of responsibilities that I have to keep, and do not seem to be able to handle."
94,55,They want to have a vaccinating team for the whole season.
94,57,"I’m in the military so I think a lot of things you have said have been made up. I’m thinking of something a lot of neo nazis would say like “The government” isn’t a joke because of the vaccines and it’s just the fact that the government doesn’t really care. I’m not saying that they aren’t a joke, but they just do not care. I’m just saying that the people who are being made up and told jokes don’t care enough, and I’m sure they are the people"
94,69,I do not know if that's true - but I can tell you that we can not have a better understanding of how viruses are transmitted in the NFL or what vaccines are used in the game. It's important to make sure that the people we have on the field are being trained to use them.
94,73,That is not a joke. It is a joke.
94,82,You don't think that's a joke? Vaccination is just a joke. You do. But you don't think that it's going to work. The government needs to fix it.
94,84,[The point of the article isn't that the government doesn't want to make them seem like a joke. They are trying to get them a joke
94,91,Vaccination is not a joke. It's a joke. But the government isn't working to protect against the spread of the virus. They aren't trying to stop the spread of a virus.

They are the CDC.
99,94,"I like the ""If"" part. It makes me feel that I'm at least partially comfortable in it. The idea is to look at the problem. I don't know what I'm talking about, but it feels good to be around people. I don't know what they're going to do to stop the virus from spreading, and it's going to be pretty tough to believe that a mask would be necessary to stop the spread. But I feel like I have no idea what that means. I don't know why they're trying to do it. I don't know how"
