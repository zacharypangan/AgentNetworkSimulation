98,87,"'Visualization' is a phrase derived from the premise of the ""'soul"" (a ""sexy""/sexy) 'Sex'' - if not a'sexy' (or whatever that means in this context) of the term, 'the person'' is the person with the mask, if the person who is the victim is the victim of the sexual compulsion to lie to the doctor about his mask - the mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of"

87,56,"In this context, the CDC is trying to help people who have been vaccinated. They want the people to keep vaccinating and prevent more spread of a virus. The CDC is trying to help them, and is in fact helping with a vaccine that prevents a virus from spreading in their country. They don't want the CDC to be in a position to protect the people in their country from this kind of virus. It's called a ""sex act"" and it's a joke. They don't need to be vaccinated for"
