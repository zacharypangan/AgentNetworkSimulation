27,12,A mask is not a right. And it can be used in order to kill a virus. The government has the right to refuse to provide medical treatment for the disease and even for those who are at risk for a second hand wound and a heart attack. Then there is the right to refuse to buy a replacement mask.

74,27,I've gotten a rash since I was little and a rash from being put in a mask. My dad was too embarrassed for me when I was young. But he went out to play ice hockey on a hot day. He always wore a mask and was completely unprepared. I had to take him to the doctor and he said he wasn't going to be able to get in if I stayed out on a cold. But he did say I was not going to wear a mask in a hippo. He is still

47,27,"It's really funny that a lot of people are saying this to be false, but I mean, if you're not a vaccinated person, you could just get away with it, too. But it would be rude if the state didn't get mandates to allow people to get vaccinated because of a lack of vaccines."
70,27,"Considering the length of time a person is going to die, it could be a really long time to wear a mask. It might not even be as difficult as it seems. If you're using it with someone else, a mask would likely work."

27,3,People wearing masks are usually sexist and sexist. Is it possible a person is ostracized by someone without a mask?
27,7,"This is crazy. People are going to say this to the people in the White House who do things like this. You need to stop having to make fun of the people who get in the way of this, and just let them know you're not going to be able to do so anyway.

38,27,"I'm really just being elitist, but the mask is on everyone and everyone."
47,27,"There's a lot of shit on here about the government being able to mandate a lot of things in a specific way, if anything it isn't going to work if the people who are going to be doing things aren't able to go to a doctor's office."
70,27,">I don't think I've ever seen a joke like that about wearing a mask and that I'm very happy about it. I'm really excited to see it on TV, but when it's true the truth reaches me! I have been wearing my mask for about 6 months, every day of the week, ever since I was born, and it's always been an easy fix. The mask in the picture is actually really cool to put on your face. I feel like the word ""smoke"" has been used in numerous cases, such as when people were given"

27,16,A doctor's office. They are the one who would be able to prescribe it. They do not even have access to it at their hospital.
27,18,"So in my experience, it's more about the person being sexist and the people actually wearing masks than it is about people who want to stop being sexist."
30,27,"It's not the NSA, it's the people, and people who work in hospitals, who have to get a mask to avoid any type of sickness. There's a reason that in the US you don't even need a mask, the NSA just gets into your house and tells you to wear it."

38,27,"There's a difference between ""he's been wearing a mask for a while now"" and ""he needs a mask"". It's not a virus. It's a virus. It's a virus."
47,27,I hate people with a lot of shit on here.
70,27,It sounds like the president has a problem with how people are treating people. It is not a joke. It is a joke.
71,27,"I can't help but think that this is very, very funny. I'm not sure why I'm making a joke or I'm not going to believe it."

27,1,">Hey, I'm a criminal that's a criminal. You might be a little naive to think that you're a fraud, but that doesn't mean that your actions are inherently evil."
27,3,It seems the most effective way to keep people from slipping into a new disease is to use it on themselves. I wouldn't want it in the first place because it would make people fuck up.
27,7,"I have no idea what you mean, but it is like saying they're gonna stop taking care of you because you are not your own mother and will go to the doctor.

27,11,"So they're saying that they don't want a ""mask"" and that they don't want to talk about this..."
27,12,I think you have a misunderstanding about what the president is referring to. He wants you to go to the hospital and do all that without you. You are not supposed to do that but you are supposed to wear a mask because it is part of the precautions that prevent people from becoming sick.
27,16,The NSA is not mandated for the benefit of people. It has been used for the benefit of the people and has made it impossible for sexist men to use masks.

30,27,"I grew up in the CDC and the CIA, and I still don't understand the meaning of this. I'm not a religious person, and it is my belief that the NSA is a terrorist organization and the fact that the CDC was the source for the CIA is the reason why I believe it is. I do not know what other stories the NSA has to defend against, but I believe that many of those things are being made up by their administration."

I had a bad experience with a mask in a cigarette shop in a CDC--I guess it was in the middle of a long night for a medical staff - but she was okay with it and my mom knew that she had a vaccinated nose and a new mask that I got on.

38,27,The article cited is a joke.
47,27,Are you saying the CDC isn't going to have the chance to prevent the spread of the virus? Because it seems very likely that the President is trying to stop a virus spread by inventing a vaccine that isn't already being prescribed?
70,27,[Cannot be bothered to type the same question I've been writing in the past: [NAME]:
71,27,Because we can't even imagine what it is like to have the virus from our own mouth.
74,27,It's illegal to wear a mask to prevent the spread of HIV. If you're not a liar you need a clerical. The CDC will revoke your ad. There are a ton of people that don't want to be in this story.
27,1,"It's a joke, a joke."
27,3,"I think the whole problem is with all the things that people in power are complaining about, they need to do, but they're in the right to do, and they will be very careful if they say they do."

27,11,No. The CDC is trying to stop the spread of the virus.
27,12,You have some interesting information about the problem in the vaccine.

47,27,There are a lot of things that the people mentioning the CDC are attempting to prevent.
70,27,Are you a person who is not racist? Because it's a joke.
71,27,And I don't get how it sounds to me.
74,27,I have had to take a restraining order and it is a prank. I just wanted to say I did not know the laws in the first place.
27,1,"There isn't anything to be ashamed of. Vaccination is not a joke. It's a joke because a prank is a joke. The CDC is trying to prevent the spread of a virus. The issue isn't about the vaccine, it's about the fact that it's not being prescribed by the government."
27,3,"There's nothing a person can do about that. If you are a prankster and they want you to suck it up, you can just do whatever you want."

71,27,I can't believe this. I'm afraid that this is going to be a major topic of discussion.
74,27,This has nothing to do with the CDC. It isn't about the government. This is about the people who don't know how to talk about a prank.
27,1,The joke is a joke because it's not about the CDC or the CDC. But the CDC's promoting the spread of a virus has done little to prevent it. The problem is that the vaccine is a joke because a lot of things the CDC says about the AIDS epidemic aren't about the vaccine.

He didn't know he was the only person he had to send them a copy of. He told me he was a doctor. He just thought the CDC was the only one he had available. But he is a bigot who has been telling it to people at work that he is going to be in the hospital."
