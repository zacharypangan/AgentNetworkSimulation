84,57,I lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam.
94,57,i love coaching however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops

58,57,You are making a huge statement that putting on a mask is the only way to prevent the spread of a virus. Is this true?
72,57,Why are you resigning? Getting a mask is a scam. I don't care what it is.
84,57,"I don't believe anything I've heard has been able to do much since I was a kid, so I think this is a good sign. I think you might be a little under the impression that you are being a dick. If it weren't for Trump, it wouldn't have happened."
94,57,That's how most people die.
57,16,I've had to use a mask.
57,36,i lost my mask at least 4 times a day. this whole thing is a scam. you are making a huge statement that putting on a mask is the only way to prevent the spread of a virus.
58,57,"This was my question, but I don't think it was correct."
72,57,We're not allowed to make any decisions at all.
84,57,"My brother and I had the same conversation once... I figured out why we lost a mask when I was a kid and we had a bit of a different perspective. I'm not a fan of wearing masks, but I can tell you the difference in what we did and what I did, versus what I could do in the '50s."
94,57,"I am really sorry, but I think it's kinda unfair that players and managers have to make such terrible decisions and that I feel like a bad person because I'm not in the right place. And for that I wish the players would stop doing that to their players."
57,16,"CANNOTANSWER MAN. I lost my face mask when i was little. I couldn't see it, my face would fall and I'd feel alot worse. And I'm now at home."
57,36,"I can only think of one person who isn't very much into the business side of things and can't even be confident in the ability to communicate well. That being said, a lot of coaches will do this, and you're right, getting a restraining order that you won't be able to tell without a mask is just not worth doing."
58,57,"""It's the same problem as the Obama's ""Pence of Perpetuity"" rule. Using a mask doesn't stop a virus. He doesn't realize that the government doesn't want us to have that virus. He sees a chance to stop it and can do so, and he's done it."
72,57,I think the most important thing you need to consider is that the masks are a scam to make people afraid to get in in public.
84,57,"Yes, you can get yourself a mask but you can't do it, you can't get away with it. If you're a virus or a person is carrying a virus, you should not be using it."
94,57,>I've found there is a special kind of mask that keeps you from touching things that might be infected. It's not worth it. It's a form of mask. I'm a teacher and I'm an adult. I'm learning about how you can make a lifelong sicker player. So if I am in the NFL I will not be there.

58,57,I don't like the Obama thing.
72,57,Taking off the mask isn't a bad idea. Its a good idea because the masks are meant to prevent ebola from spreading.
84,57,"I'm not saying that this is a scam, but I do believe that the government's ability to fight the spread of a virus is one of the big pillars of our government's effectiveness."
94,57,i think i am going to have to say some things and get to the bottom of that thread and say nothing.
57,16,Is this on a sub that people haven't heard of yet? Because it's pretty obvious this subreddit is full of shit.
57,36,"""Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
58,57,"So, the NSA is using this as a joke. What's the point of it?"
72,57,>> Why are you resigning? Getting a mask is a scam.
84,57,... And they say something about how the government is just trying to make people realize it is a scam and that they are a scammer.
94,57,"I'm pretty sure the number one complaint about the government is, ""Assuming that everyone wears masks and that they don't think it's a good idea to do it at all."""
57,16,"It is a scam, and it makes people feel bad."
57,36,"So I think there's an issue with ""Sticking masks off the field isn't going to stop the spread of a virus."""
58,57,"""As a presidential candidate, it makes no sense for me to put on a mask. I just want to have him gone."""
72,57,"It's like the NSA is trying to sell a medical device that can prevent HIV/AIDS and the people who are infected with it, but it's not gonna stop the spread of it. It's the only way to prevent HIV/AIDS."
84,57,What can the government do with your mask and what a good excuse to not wear one? That's not a scam.
94,57,"Vaccination is a terrible disease. If your team is vaccinated, a player can not be infected. If they are not vaccinated, you will have to wear a mask. It's a bad thing. The only way to stop it is to put on a mask so you can be vaccinated. The whole thing is BS. i think that they don't know the full picture but not a full explanation. I don't have a clue. Wearing a mask is a ridiculous and ridiculous."
57,16,I'm gonna try and find the NSA's best guess for what I don't know.
57,36,"I think there is no reason to resign, at least not at all."
58,57,"I believe you just said, ""I don't like the Obama thing."""
72,57,I think the issue here is that the masks were just used for a certain reason. This is a joke.
84,57,"It's not just the CDC and other countries trying to combat the spread of HIV and its spread. It's the US government trying to do the same thing, just with less money."
94,57,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

84,57,A scam is the way we get around the problem of people getting a virus that doesn't have a true cure.
94,57,I can't believe the amount of dick spray that's on the NFL field.
57,16,"In the article, the NSA says ""If you don't wear a mask, then you won't be vaccinated and you won't be vaccinated and you'll have to wear a mask."" It doesn't mention the word 'vaccinated', but the'skinny' part. Those kinds of things aren't common in the United States and I don't know why it's so popular. I don't think any one can believe the hype over the Obama years without trying to scarred them. Is that"
57,36,I've always thought that the best way to avoid the spread of a virus would be to get them vaccinated. But it seems like it seems like the only way you could stop it is to get it vaccinated. So it's not like they're claiming to be doing that to everyone and that it's just a joke.
58,57,"The question of the 'Pence of Perpetuity' rule is whether this is a real thing or not, and whether it is a ploy or not to evade the rule. It is a really bad idea."

94,57,I wouldn't like to hear what it's like for a person to think that the government is scummy and doesn't really care.
57,16,So... what did you say to this commenter?
57,36,I think the NSA should have addressed this in their next interview and the next.
58,57,A good place to start. They have a lot of information that they need to know how to handle it. He's just trying to make a joke about the fact that it is so bad for the environment that it's infected people.
72,57,"I'm not a scientist. I'm not a troll. I just have no clue what to do. It's the government. It has no obligation to prevent a health condition in America. It's a threat to our health, or our nation. Vaccinating against AIDS is a real problem, but they can't prevent a real illness. Having a virus is a real problem, and the only real way to prevent it is to keep it from spreading. They want to stop putting masks on people. They want to stop doing that"
84,57,"The only time I've ever heard it like that was at my job. The guy I worked with was a woman. A man who is not a guy got the wrong thing and his mask was on and on. He still has a man's mask. That's his face. A man with a mask isn't a guy. He wears it on and on, he doesn't. It's like a man with a face."

57,36,"As a guy who has a face, I feel like the ""skinny part"" is pretty much what I am looking for in a hat."
58,57,It's not a joke. It is a joke.
72,57,(a) Do not buy your own mask.
84,57,The issue is that people don't want to use it. So you go out to the bathroom and a girl isn't even wearing a mask.
94,57,I think this isn't a joke but the whole thing is BS. They don't have the proper understanding to get them infected.
57,16,A lot of people seem to think that wearing a mask to prevent the spread of a virus.A lot of people seem to think that wearing a mask to prevent the spread of AIDS is a scam. A lot of people seem to think that wearing a mask to prevent the spread of HIV is a scam.
57,36,I'm a teacher and I was a coach. They told me they should make a law to prevent them from using masks.
58,57,"Well... It sounds like they are going to get a new mandate for the mask. It sounds like that's going to be a nice, nice reminder that they are using the NSA as a ploy to stop the spread of viruses."
72,57,"I am sorry, but this seems to be a joke from a political perspective, and while I will take all of it with a grain of salt, I do think it's a bit of a stretch to say that this joke is not true. If the CDC has to enforce the laws of the United States, I think it should be called ""nobody cares"" and should have no issue requiring the authorities to enforce the laws."
84,57,It’s been a long time since I was on that phone.
94,57,What's the next line?
57,16,Vaccination is a terrible thing.
57,36,Why didn't they say that they're doing that to the players? It's because they said something about having no intention of bringing that up on this website.
58,57,The CDC is a good place to start. They have a lot of information that they need to know how to handle it. They have a lot of information that they need to know how to handle it.
72,57,People just say it’s a joke. The CDC’s actions are in the name of protecting public health and keeping it a secret and not for making people afraid of getting in public. The first thing to ask is if the masks are for a purpose. The second thing is whether the government is authorized to do it.
84,57,"The people putting on masks.. is actually a good sign, to say the least. The CDC wants to cut costs, so they put on the masks. I guess it's not a huge scam."
94,57,I love how the government snobbers at the word 'troll'. The point isn't to make a joke but to imply that it is.
57,16,You mean that the person trying to make a joke is a shill for people like you?
57,36,"Well, the point is that the government should be doing things without any government approval."
58,57,The President and the CDC are being used as a ploy to stop the spread of viruses. The CDC isn't a joke.
72,57,"Vaccination against AIDS is a real problem. Having a virus is a real problem, but it's not gonna stop the spread of it. They can't enforce their own laws unless they have a good reason to enforce them. Vaccines are not a problem. The CDC has the authority to enforce their own laws, because it is a legitimate issue."
84,57,"I'm not going to lie, this is a horrible thing to say. It's really just a big piece of shit."
94,57,"Its not a joke, it is a fact that the CDC doesn't seem to care about the health of the players. The CDC doesn't seem to care. They have no reason to be on the receiving end of the problem."
57,16,I think the most important thing you need to consider is that the masks are a scam to make people afraid to get in in public.
57,36,So the president and the CDC are being used as a ploy to stop the spread of viruses.
58,57,"I just want you to know that I'm a very liberal person and a racist. I don't like the idea of being able to support the president of the United States in any way, but when someone has already done their job I have to say something along the lines of:"
72,57,"... which, according to the article, is exactly what they do. They fuck people about wearing a mask to prevent HIV/AIDS. Vaccination is the only effective way to prevent it. It's not about stopping the spread of AIDS. But it's about stopping the spread of it. It is a legitimate issue."
84,57,"Well, this is very confusing. The idea is that you have a face mask that means you can't have it on you. That's what I said."
94,57,"It seems like the problem was caused by the players not taking the vaccine, it wasn't the CDC and not the CDC. If you had vaccinated you would have to use masks as well."
57,16,I'm very proud of myself. I'm the only one who will ever find my way to the front page of this subreddit.
57,36,"It would have made me want to quit working at the University of Michigan. I feel bad now, I just got back from the beach."
58,57,The joke is a joke.
72,57,"I am a big fan of Trump's “I feel like this is a good thing that is being done,” but that doesn't mean it's a good thing that the government has no obligation to prevent people from getting in to this world."
84,57,I lost a face mask once on a Friday morning in front of a family member. It was too much shit.
94,57,"There are people who make jokes about the government and it's shit. It's like ""I hate that they don't vaccinate their own players. But I am sure it is not all that bad."""
57,16,"Vaccination is not a joke, it's a joke."
57,36,"I've been wearing a mask for years and I just lost one, never even looked at it, was afraid of being photographed and went into a panic attack and immediately went back to my car, fumbling for almost 4 minutes, with a nipple. It was so awfully disgusting. It would hurt my face to not have seen it."
58,57,I'm trying to be lucid.
72,57,I know that the most important thing people need to consider is that the masks were just used for a certain reason. This is a joke.
84,57,"I'd like to point out that I'm a huge fan of all of the scams - but the one where I got caught wearing one was actually in the '70s. It's a little weird to look at. Vaccination is great if you're having a lot of health issues, but I can't see that being a snoop like this would make anyone less fucking angry."
94,57,I can't believe how many vaccines are in use in football and they don't have enough information to prevent all those dicks from getting into their noses and throats
57,16,This is a joke. The only thing that smacked off on me was a joke. I'm gonna go on a bit with this.
57,36,"I recited a post that made me believe it was just a'smashing', which is actually a joke. It was that it was a 'joke', which is why it's a joke. It's about a fake news story and the kind of propaganda that i feel I need to spread to all my friends, and they don't know the real facts. They're making this up for themselves."
58,57,"I read this in the voice of John Stump. I'd be a little too much of a doctor to not want to go to the doctor and get vaccinated, but this kind of joke is a joke but is shady."
72,57,The article's title is misleading. I think the question is what is being asked?
84,57,"Vaccination is so important, it's just the joke, so it can't be a joke if it's used in a similar way to the ""i lose a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a scam."

58,57,"It would make sense if the president had a similar statement to the one on the Obama issue (The CDC) stating that he would keep the people at work unless they were exposed to the virus. He would have known that he wasn't safe in the first place, but was trying to get that right."
72,57,"If it's just a joke, it's a joke. The government is going to enforce the laws for people."
84,57,"I don't get the whole joke. It's an effective and effective way to control the spread of HIV, so I don't really think it's worth the money. If you're not worried about the other issues in the disease, you're not worried about the medical system, the doctors, or whatever else."
94,57,So you're referring to the NFL.
57,16,A lot of people seem to think that wearing a mask to prevent the spread of AIDS is a scam.
57,36,Why are the guys getting a restraining order? If the CDC and CDC are trying to stop it then why would anyone want to be fired?
58,57,The joke isn't about the virus. It's about allowing the CDC to do whatever they want to do to stop it.
72,57,It's also a joke about a guy who isn't quite the president that's making fun of the president
84,57,"I've said the same thing about Trump, but he doesn't really sound like an expert."
94,57,The problem is that if people like you weren't vaccinated they wouldn't be making jokes about the government and they don't care about them.
57,16,People get that it's one of the most basic things you can do and that a 'couple of things' that you can do that people can't do that's a joke. And they are a huge part of that.
57,36,>We've always thought that the best way to avoid the spread of a virus would be to get them vaccinated.
58,57,"You know that the joke is a joke, but the truth is the joke is a joke, and the truth is the joke is a joke."
72,57,"A lot of things are so stupid, I thought they should have a story like this."
84,57,A lot of people seem to think that wearing a mask to prevent the spread of HIV is a joke. The CDC has a policy against vaccination for certain countries.
94,57,Vaccination is a bad thing.
57,16,That's the point of the post - you can get a msg and prevent it.
57,36,There are literally literally millions of Americans in the world who've never been to a doctor and never saw a doctor.
58,57,He can’t use the mask and will stop the spread of the virus.
72,57,"It's a joke, because it's going to make the CDC look like a joke."
84,57,The fact that the CDC is trying to cut costs is also a big piece of shit. And I think the first part is a joke about how a lot of people have a hard time getting around HIV.
94,57,"You are wrong. Your comment implying that people are doing it, and not your implication that they do it, is a joke."
57,16,I just want to tell you the truth: vaccine is a joke.
57,36,I've never heard of the CDC. I mean I've seen the CDC.
58,57,The fact that we're still getting to hear stories about Obama being a racist makes it hard to understand that a joke isn't a joke.
72,57,"If you're a doctor, you don't have to be a doctor."
84,57,Vaccination is important but not a joke. Vaccination is an important part of the health system.
94,57,The government is trying to protect the health of their players.
57,16,"Yes it is a joke, a joke and a joke are both jokes and jokes. It's not a joke, it's a joke."
57,36,"Vaccination is a joke, isn't it? There is no 'how do I get a vaccination?' You have the right to believe whatever you want without telling the truth. They are trying to stop this and they are trying to stop it. I'm afraid to admit that it's a joke - but I understand why people don't like it."
58,57,"Then don't talk to this guy, he's talking about the virus being spread on Facebook."
72,57,The only reason the CDC isn't putting masks on fucking people is because it relates to a joke about the ACA and the way it's a joke.
84,57,"The US government is doing something wrong. A CDC spokesperson stated that ""the number one reason to get vaccinated is because it isn't inherently bad."""
94,57,I was a student at a college where we have a lot of jokes about the government and the vaccine. It was not a joke. I got to see it when i was a kid and it started to hit the front page.
57,16,The word is being used for the “could” of 'vaccinated' and 'a joke. The NSA is trying to sell the msg but they don’t want to be on the front page.
57,36,Vaccination is the number one reason to get vaccinated.
58,57,This is a joke about the NSA and the CDC... but the president is a joke?
72,57,"I don't have the full-blown answer, but the CDC's response seems somewhat condescending."
84,57,Vaccination is an important part of the health system. It's an important part of the health system. Vaccination is an important part of the health system.
94,57,"This isn't the government. The CDC doesn't have any sort of role whatsoever in preventing that type of disease. The CDC has a role in fighting it, but not preventing it because it's a virus."
57,16,"Vaccination is a joke, which is exactly what the government wants."
57,36,"I see it, and I don't like it. And I don't think I would resign."
58,57,I've been in this position for 2 years and that one is one of the most popular jokes I have ever seen.
72,57,It's a joke that's a lot of fun. And I don't care who a guy is.
84,57,I read this while I was at work and it was really hilarious.
94,57,As a professional soccer coach I am hesitant to start the year. In fact I have read a few books where I have gotten a pretty good understanding of the basic functions of the vaccine as well as the different ways they work.
57,16,"Vaccination is a joke, but not a joke."
57,36,"In addition to the jokes and the fact that a doctor would be in there and know about the vaccine when you're in a 'coach'', you may also be able to see if a doctor has seen the vaccine (or not) if you were to get the vaccine, too."
58,57,I think the question is about whether the joke is a joke.
72,57,I'm pretty sure the first part of the quote is correct. It's not a joke. The next part is actually a joke.
84,57,And it seems like the CDC is trying to cut costs. They're suing the government. They're suing for fraud.
94,57,"""The problem is that if people like you weren't vaccinated, they wouldn't be making jokes about the government and they don't care."""
57,16,"I guess if they just want to make you feel bad, they should give you a bit more credit for not being a joke - to get people to think they were doing a joke, or maybe they should say ""hey if i had a joke I would probably think I'd have a good day. """
57,36,"I'm not saying it's an appropriate way to stop a virus. I'm saying it's not that the government is trying to make a joke, it's that the CDC is trying to bolster the public health system."
58,57,> [The President is a joke. They are using the CDC as a ploy to stop the spread of viruses. The CDC is a ploy. They have a lot of information that they need to know how to handle it.
72,57,> Because I don't care what it is
84,57,"It is a joke to get vaccinated, not to have the same effect on the medical system. This is the only time I've heard the joke as a joke. Vaccination is a joke because it is an important part of the health system."
94,57,"Why does a ""Joke"" come up?"
57,16,I was born and raised on a farm so I know a lot about the people who were vaccinated with HIV when they were kids. So I can say I have always gotten a bit of a joke based on these jokes. I don't have any problem believing the jokes or even thinking I'm doing anything wrong. So I just don't have one.
57,36,I want you to know that I am not a racist and I am not a racist.
58,57,I'm trying to put the president in a different position than this one. This isn't a joke.
72,57,I don't think any of those things are jokes. And I'm so sorry he is trying to make a joke. Vaccines are not a joke because they are not allowed under federal regulations.
84,57,"What about my uncle? ""I have a lot of problems, I have an allergy and I don't want to keep them in my house. I don't want to get vaccinated again."" ""My uncle got sick in a day and I got a little remorse when he told me I was vaccinated. But we don't get the shot."" ""I want him to go and get vaccinated again."" ""I can't believe that I lost a mask because I do not want to wear a mask on me and the people"
94,57,"Vaccination is bad. It is a joke because of the fact that a lot of people are actually having issues, including people being harmed, being injured or killed."
57,16,"Well, in terms of a joke - a slap on the wrist to a kid if the doctor had seen a doctor with an HIV-infected child's hand - you are correct that the president is trying to use a mask to prevent HIV. The US government has been accused of trying to nitpick on the matter."
57,36,"A lot of people are talking about how people should get vaccinated, but they're still talking about the way we treat people. A lot of people aren't trying to prove that they have AIDS."
58,57,It's an easy joke. It can be funny and a joke if you really want to. It's just a joke. The president has a lot of other things to do to prevent the spread of viruses. It's a joke because it carries a risk.
72,57,I read the article in a different context:
84,57,A joke is a joke. A joke is a joke.
94,57,"Vaccination is a joke, but it isn't actually a joke. You don't know what a joke is, but it is something that is a joke, and not a joke. It's like saying a funny cartoon is being portrayed, but I don't think that it's. It doesn't even need to be a joke to make sense, since the joke is ""I don't like you saying that the government is scummy and doesn't care"" as if the joke is about the government being a joke."""
57,16,It's the same as a joke.
57,36,You have to be the right guy to get a vaccine
58,57,"A lot of people are going to say the same thing, 'but it's a joke.'"
72,57,"I don't have much a lot of knowledge on how the CDC is doing it, but I can tell you there's a fair amount of context where this is being presented."
84,57,"You're referring to ""I lost a mask at least four times a day. This whole thing is a good sign. I think you might be a little under the impression that you are being a dick. If it weren't for Trump, it wouldn't have happened."", ""I'm not saying that this is a joke, but I can tell you the difference in what we did and what I could do, versus what I could do in the 50s."", ""I think it's a big piece of shit."", ""I'"
94,57,I have always thought about vaccines as bad as those other things. I think we know that vaccines are used for something that is absolutely necessary but it is not just to prevent the spread of the disease and the government is trying to stop it.
57,16,Because if you don't know if the mask is good or not you're probably going to have more problems with it than you do with a face mask. You should wear one for your job. And I would also suggest you do not get a face mask because you would get an infection. I'd also suggest you wear a facial mask to help your immunity - your health is most important.
57,36,"I've always felt like the CDC should have made it a priority to put on masks. However, I think the CDC has an issue with the restraining order being put on the gov't. I'm also sure that there is a gov't. gov. issue where there is a gov't issue with the use of masks in a non-negotiable fashion that people have been vaccinated with."
58,57,"This is one of the most popular jokes I have ever seen on TV, and I can't find a more accurate title."
72,57,I think the most important thing people need to consider is that the masks are just for a certain purpose. This is a joke.
84,57,>I'm going to say that the CDC is suing me for a joke. I think it's a big piece of shit.
94,57,"""I know that we do not have a legitimate reason to be on the receiving end of a joke."""
57,16,It is a joke if you don't wear a mask for a while. The government has the right to get you into trouble.
57,36,"I think the CDC has done a pretty good job explaining their own'smoking' on the Internet, and they want people to realize that if they have been doing things that aren't 'good' to their own kids, 'they're not worth doing' because they're allowing people to do those things that aren't in their care to be vaccinated."
58,57,A lot of people are blaming the president for not getting vaccinated and it's not a joke. The President is trying to make a joke about the virus. It's a joke because it carries a risk.
72,57,Well that's a good joke. It was a joke.
84,57,"There's a misunderstanding here that you're probably a dick. The CDC is suing you for a joke and you're obviously making a joke about the CDC and it's effectiveness in combating the disease. It sounds like you're thinking of the CDC and you haven't read the CDC's article yet. So, the joke goes from ""The CDC is suing me for a joke, but it's a joke"" to ""The CDC is trying to do something that will stop it."""
94,57,The jokes are about the CDC. They are trying to prevent the spread of a virus. They are trying to prevent it because it's a joke and it doesn't exist. That's not the joke.
57,16,"So the first part of that isn't a joke, it's that the president is trying to stop this shit. It's not a joke. It's just that the CDC is trying to make people feel bad. They're trying to make a joke. It's not that they're trying to make people feel bad, it's that they're trying to make people feel bad because they think that the truth of the joke isn't what they want."
57,36,>The president is trying to make a joke about the CDC and the CDC is trying to stop the spread of a virus.
58,57,The CDC is trying to make a joke out of the virus.
72,57,The story is going on a bit in an article by the CDC.
84,57,The CDC is suing me for a joke because they're trying to...
94,57,">I'm pretty sure the number one complaint about the government is, ""Assuming that everyone wears a mask and that they don't think it's a good idea to do it at all."""
57,16,I think we need to get the CDC to stop using the phrase 'Mask' in a joke.
57,36,It has been over 30 years since I was a student. I think I know a bit better.
58,57,Vaccination is a joke. It's a joke because it's necessary to keep people safe.
72,57,"That was a very good question. The CDC is being misinterpreted as a fraud and not a joke and that is part of the joke, and is essentially going to make them look like a joke. That's a funny question. 'We've got a lot of people in it.' I'm not saying it's a joke, but I'm not saying it's a joke."
84,57,"No kidding. I've been there, you know, the world's best'stylist'."
94,57,"If you’re a politician, do you want to be the top commentator?"
57,16,"Alot of people are saying I think a mask is a joke, which is a joke."
57,36,"I believe you're being sarcastic and need to know something, because you are a racist."
58,57,"Because of a viral infection is one of the most harmful diseases that has ever been identified, it's a joke and a joke."
72,57,"> Vaccination against AIDS is a real problem. Having a virus is a real problem, but they can't stop the spread of it. They want to stop doing that.'"
84,57,"A joke is an incredibly obvious excuse, if I have a single example, and I'm going to be a total naive fuck for not having the answer."
94,57,"This is why if I asked people to stop putting on a mask and they didn't, the question would be, ""how did they get all this nonsense to stop? Because you are doing this because you aren't vaccinated, so you are infected?"""
57,16,"The whole purpose of the article is to show that a lot of people would have thought a doctor would be able to diagnose HIV because of this. They're obviously not able to have a standardized HIV test, they're unable to have any standardized tests on the health of people that have HIV."
57,36,"I don't know if i'm correct or wrong - but I'm not exactly sure how well they're trying to address this problem, but they might just have a bit of a misdirection about it. There's no point in not vaccinating people, but putting on masks is just making them look like a joke."
58,57,"This article describes the actual threat of the vaccination, as well as the dangers of this infection."
72,57,I read the article and there's nothing funny. I'm so sorry he's trying to make a joke.
84,57,A good point was that some of the things cited by the CDC were in the 1950s. That was in the 90s.
94,57,"Is a vaccine a joke? If not, why don't you make a joke about vaccinating your teammates? If not, why don't you make a joke about the CDC."
57,16,"[Assuming that everyone has a vaccine and that it's a joke, and they're unable to have a standardized HIV test, they're unable to have any standardized tests on the health of people who have HIV.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination)"
57,36,"CANNOTANSWER: ""I think a lot of people are saying I think a mask is a joke."
58,57,"In addition to all the other jokes you’ve listed, you also should check out the article Pence of Perpetuity> about the President - a joke that describes the use of the mask as the only way to prevent a virus"
72,57,"The CDC doesn't have to enforce any laws on vaccination, it's just a joke."
84,57,This is not about me...I'm about the CDC suing me for the first and second sentence. This is not about anyone. This is about the actual situation with the CDC.
94,57,The vaccine is the best way to stop the spread of the virus.
57,16,Vaccination is not a joke.
57,36,It sounds like someone had a problem with the CDC.
58,57,"Vaccination is a joke because it's necessary to keep people safe, because it has a risk to both the environment and the people that are infected. The president isn't 'in charge' of stopping the spread of the virus. That's not a joke."
72,57,"I would like to give my 2 cents to the CDC, they can have a ""scam"" if they want. That would be really weird."
84,57,Is it not a joke?
94,57,The government is working to stop dick spray from reaching players. They are trying to do everything they can to make it safe.
57,16,The joke. A joke. The joke. Vaccination is a joke. The joke. This is not a joke. It's a joke. 'Vaccination is a joke.
57,36,"As an example, I read the article and felt like a joke, and I was really confused, and I thought, ""How do you see this, and I don't know if I'm correct or wrong."""
58,57,Vaccination is a joke - and isn't a joke - because it's necessary to prevent the spread of viruses and that it doesn't have to be a joke - it's a joke because it's needed to stop the spread of viruses. It's a joke because it's necessary to prevent the spread of viruses and that it is a joke. It's a joke because it's needed to prevent the spread of viruses. It's a joke because it's used for the purpose of stopping the spread of viruses.
72,57,"You're the first person to read the article? Then, they're going to be asking if they are really allowed to put masks on people. Especially if they're going to be taking the whole joke seriously."
84,57,I was surprised to see the comment threw up to me. I thought you were just referring to the guy who was in front of a woman who was in the bathroom because she had a mask and a guy in her face. If you have a face mask you are referring to the guy who did it and then got away with it.
94,57,"I’m in the military so I think a lot of things you have said have been made up. I’m thinking of something a lot of neo nazis would say like “The government” isn’t a joke because of the vaccines and it’s just the fact that the government doesn’t really care. I’m not saying that they aren’t a joke, but they just do not care. I’m just saying that the people who are being made up and told jokes don’t care enough, and I’m sure they are the people"
