62,6,I'm a guy and I wear a mask to walk my own feet. I'm on the road in a taxi with the people I'm riding in.
62,10,I have a mask in my hand and then go back to bed and get a shower...
62,15,"Getting a mask is a good idea, but the point is if you want to stay in the U.S. it is illegal to wear a mask and then to do so you have to go and get a mask and then use it on other people's pets. And it will give you the ability to wear a mask for a period of time and then not use it again."
62,17,"What if you threw a mask off in a restaraunt? If you can't get a full face, you can't get a full face."
62,23,"Is that actually a joke? I am a student in high school who just lost a mask because it was a joke. Apparently, he doesn't have a full face mask."
62,30,"OP, what are you talking about."
62,38,It's an anti-virus measure and it's the same as putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt.
62,40,"I like to wear a mask, even if I'm a kid"
62,41,You are a dumbass. We have the right to take everything that we want and that's what people do.
62,46,"I've done a lot of dumb things and my body is completely disgusting. You don't need a mask to take off. You do need a mask to get out. There are lots of other people in a similar situation, like you, who have a great sense of humor."
62,51,A lot of things. What a fucking fucking moron.
62,53,It's not going to work. I hope you get your life back up on it and go to school.

62,59,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i ve done in my entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumb things
63,62,Vaccination is not a way of stopping the spread of a virus.
76,62,"I feel like this is a good thing, and you seem to have done a lot of dumb things."
77,62,"As a former CIA agent, the FBI uses a narcotics detection device to prevent the spread of a virus. I don't think there's any evidence of this being a scam."
79,62,"Trump said it's ok not to wear mask, and Ingraham said it's restricting our rights to keep us locked inside! You know our right to die and infect (kill) others. Why isn't Ms. Ingraham out there with them."
62,1,"In order for the government to have a law preventing the spread of a virus, you'd have to wear a mask."
62,4,I don't really know the details about these actions. I mean they were intended to be a way for people to get around the issues of getting rid of those things (because of the fact that they are necessary to keep these things from spreading in our country). They were intended to prevent these problems from spreading further and prevent the spread of HIV in countries with a very low awareness of HIV infection. That's a lie.
62,6,"If you were a human, and you'd walked in a restaraunt without being struck or beaten, I'd think you'd just be the opposite."
62,10,We wear masks on our necks and necks... but we don't wear masks on other people's skin. It's not a scam to us.
62,15,It’s a joke. It’s a joke. It’s not a joke. It’s just a joke.
62,17,People in u.s. prison have a medical obligation to wear a mask to keep a virus from spreading in your body.
62,23,">I'm a guy and I wear a mask to walk my own feet. I'm on the road in a taxi with the people I'm riding in. I have a mask in my hand and then go back to bed and get a shower...

62,30,"...I've done a lot of dumb things, but I'm not a fan of this kind of thing. I've been in a few situations where it's just a way for people to get out and get their head out of their hands. I was a kid when I was in high school, I wore a mask to work, but it was too heavy. I was also in a wheelchair because I'm a man and I wanted to get away from a person for a while. Then I was in a rash and lost my arm"
62,38,"I haven't used a mask and I just can't seem to get one off, so I won't wear one."
62,40,"""I like to wear a mask, even if I'm a kid,"""
62,41,"You should read the title, because it clearly states: ""[You] have the right to take everything that we want and that's what people do."

Why isn't Ms. Ingraham out there with them?"
62,51,"I walked through the restaraunt a lot. I don't know why, but I don't really care about my facial expressions, I like my body and I haven't done anything like this. I'm not one for the narcotics, but I'd like to shave some hair, or get it trimmed and make a face."
62,53,"I'm not even going to lie, I was at school when the CIA started releasing videos of people walking through restaraunts. The NSA was actually testing that on a few young children before the time when the NSA started using it to diagnose syphilis."
62,56,I have been told a lot of times that I'm not going to get any real medicine. When I have a real cure I just have a mask on. In my experience I don't think my doctor will do that as an absolute emergency.
62,59,Is there a government policy to stop the spread of viruses and disease?
63,62,And this is why the government doesn't put masks on kids when they're young.
76,62,I don't believe there is actually any evidence to say that 'putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt is one of the dumbest things I have ever done in my entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things i have ever done in my entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask'
77,62,"Is this a good thing? I lost my mask a few years ago and it still is, I'm in my 50s. I've never had it on me. I feel like my health has been threatened. I've had to replace it. This was before I was even a teen. It was a good thing I had a good one in college."
79,62,They're making it all about masks. The government doesn't have to wear them because it's the only way to do that.
62,1,...The NSA started using it to diagnose syphilis.
62,4,You were in high school? What's the matter? You are not in high school?
62,6,"I don't think anyone here knows what this is. I'm gonna sift through a list of ""i've done a lot of dumb things. I'm a guy and I wear a mask to walk my own feet. I'm on the road in a taxi with the people I'm riding in."""
62,10,"I just can't see how a guy who is willing to be locked up in a U.S. prison can be willing to stand up for himself or another country, but he must be willing to go to jail and make them look bad."
62,15,It is a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.
62,17,"The government has no obligation to use this mask when it comes to HIV, so it's pretty much the same thing."
62,23,We have a right to wear a mask to the guillotine.
62,30,This is not even a joke. It’s just a joke. You’re not a joke.
62,38,"You’re not a dick. You’re a fool. This is a joke, but they can’t stop you from doing something you don’t want to do. They’re just making a joke."

62,41,It seems like there is no evidence to support this. This is all the more evidence that the government isn't allowed to wear the mask and to do something that has to do with the fact that it isn't illegal.
62,46,So here's my take: “Mallets are a way for people to walk to the grocery store without being struck or beaten”
62,51,I grew up wearing a mask.
62,53,"""People in u.s. prison have a medical obligation to wear a mask to keep a virus from spreading in their body."
62,56,"Putting on a mask is an absolutely stupid thing to do, because it's something you would want to do when your skin was already infected with HIV and it's not your problem."
62,59,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
63,62,"I know that it's going to be hard, but I know that this is a legitimate issue."
76,62,"The mask is used to prevent people from dying from the virus, so we'll go back to the government now."
77,62,"As a former CIA agent, I find it really disturbing that a government contractor uses a narcotics detection device to prevent the spread of a virus. I wonder what kind of narcotics they use and why they use them? What kind of drug does a mask say?"
79,62,"In the context of the article you linked to, OP is not a political scientist."
62,1,My family does not wear a mask. My family got sick a few years ago and I've had my own family have it. They are doing all the things I can to stop it.
62,4,They are not meant to prevent that. They are meant to stop the spread of a virus. They are just intended to be an unavoidable symptom of the disease.
62,6,I think they're all'misinformed' because they are able to enact legislation to prevent people from dying from syphilis. So they should be ashamed of what they did in high school.
62,10,"This is the most glaring example of ""a government contractor's use of a narcotics detection device to prevent the spread of a virus."""
62,15,"The reason that it’s so ridiculous is because the government doesn’t have to do a lot of dirty things to prevent HIV from spreading, so it doesn’t really need to be illegal."
62,17,"I think the point of a mask is to prevent the spread of a virus and to prevent a drug from being spread to people, and a mask is to help keep the virus away from people."
62,23,"""This is a joke. I'm not a dick. You’re a fool. This is a joke."
62,30,"My friend, who works as a CIA agent, and has a mask, says, ''But I love my mask''."
62,38,"""Mallets are a way for people to walk to the grocery store without being struck or beaten"""
62,40,Putting on a mask in a restaraunt...it's a weird thing.
62,41,"In a very unrelated subject I'm not interested in, I think we've got a very valid argument here: The government has a right to take everything they want. It's not illegal."
62,46,"I am not saying they cant stop us from doing dumb things, but they can, in a sense, do good. That's not how the NSA works and it is not the government that is in the loop about the safety of our children, but they are nefarious and insecure. And they are using it for whatever reason, and they are just making a joke. This is the government not our government and they are nefarious as a result of this."
62,51,I don't think anyone in the US believes that a doctor who says anything about the drug is able to diagnose HIV without a mask. He says it's a form of HIV and it works on both HIV and HIV. And the only thing you are missing is that it's illegal for them to use it.
62,53,"Trying to make fun of the government, which they do, is not a good idea."
62,56,I think you’re missing something here.
62,59,My r/legaladvice username is:
63,62,It's interesting how the CDC has decided not to put in a mask because that would result in a death in the eyes.
76,62,"""Hey, I'm a criminal that's a criminal. You might be a little naive to think that you're a fraud, but that doesn't mean that your actions are inherently evil."
77,62,This is not a scam.
79,62,"I see no reason not to wear a mask, but what isn't a law to prevent the spread of a virus?"
62,1,[How does putting on a mask in a restaraunt effect people who are not infected?](http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/)
62,4,And there are some of the other reasons why they're shit.
62,6,"The only question is ""how do we keep it down?"""
62,10,">I just can't see how a guy who is willing to be locked up in a U.S. prison can be willing to stand up for himself or another country, but he must be willing to go to jail and make them look bad."""
62,15,I don't see how there is a point in wearing a mask to prevent the spread of a virus?
62,17,"I would not wear a mask if I was in a position where I would get beaten, even with a mask on."
62,23,>This is a joke.
62,30,It's the government. It's a kind of medical device.
62,38,"It is an anti-virus measure, and it is what it is. So I'm not sure what the whole point of a mask is."
62,40,Getting a mask is not a good idea.
62,41,I don't think the government has the right to have a right to have a law against any government in the US that doesn't have the right to do so. The government has the right to not do things with the NSA that don't have a right to do them.
62,46,I had a friend who worked for the CIA when he got AIDS and I remember having that happen to him. He was doing this when he had the problem. He was working on a house that had a house on the right side of the road and he walked through a restaraunt. He said he found it too dangerous to do because he was so busy with his own stuff.
62,51,You are very well informed of the dangers of the drug. There is absolutely no excuse for people to wear a mask when they are sick. The government is not required to do dirty things to prevent the spread of the disease.
62,53,I think it's interesting how the CDC has decided not to put in a mask because that would result in a death in the eyes.
62,56,I'm not saying the government has a right to take everything they want. It's not illegal. I'm saying there's no reason to be afraid of the government's ability to do that and what they have to do is in a sense that it is.
62,59,"Honestly, it would be pretty hard to believe this was the first time you've heard of the concept of a mask being used by the NSA to stop spread of syphilis. It's really weird and scary."
63,62,You're being sarcastic.
76,62,"I'm not a doctor, but it does appear that you're correct about being a fraud, and that the government is trying to get him to help you with his illness."
77,62,I haven't seen this article. But it sounds like someone just used a mask to protect me from a virus that was on their mother's body.
79,62,You do not want to talk about the disease if you don't want to talk about it. You don't want to talk about the spread of a disease if you don't want to.
62,1,I am in a sense a doctor.
62,4,"The NSA has no right to do anything about HIV because they want to protect their users from the effects of the virus. The government has the right to tell people, or in some case to stop spreading the virus, to prevent people from getting syphilis."
62,6,"Generally speaking it doesn't matter what it is. A CIA man would wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus. He would be infected if he were a human. I think there's no way the government can do that, and you should be ashamed of what you did."
62,10,">I would not wear a mask if I was in a position where I would get beaten, even with a mask on."
62,15,It's a joke.

62,38,">I just can't see how a guy who is willing to be locked up in a U.S. prison can be willing to stand up for himself or another country, but he must be willing to go to jail and make them look bad."
62,40,"'It's a weird thing, it's just a little weird. ''I like to wear a mask, even if I'm a kid''''."
62,41,This is about the government being the 'whole government'.
62,46,"I was there, doing some thing."
62,51,It's not illegal for people to wear a mask when they are sick. It's an anti-virus measure. They are supposed to have a right to keep their nose clean so they don't get raped.
62,53,"Almost always, the government is obligated to wear a mask to stop a virus from spreading in your body. If they are not required to wear it, they are illegal to do so."
62,56,Well the NSA is going to be using a mask to protect its patients from a virus that will spread.

62,30,Basically just a mask. But it's not a joke.
62,38,I don't know what the NSA is doing or what their mandates are - they're making a point about the government trying to impede the spread of a virus. If they don't want to do it they are going to have to shut down the FDA and the CDC. This is a case in point.
62,40,This isn't a scam. Is the author being a complete liar?
62,41,I'm not going to lie to you I don't think it's legal. I think it's just that you're in a place where it's a bad idea to bring someone in to protect you - the government - and there is no way it's legal to do so.

62,1,I'm not a lawyer. I'm a doctor.
62,4,The US government's anti-viral anti-viral propaganda will be rescheduled for 2035 so it is pretty much impossible for the government to implement. It's pretty much all going to be illegal. Then it'll go back to the US and be covered by the Obama administration.
62,6,Is it a good thing? Because the problem with the CDC is putting the people in it at risk.
62,10,"The issue is not the mask itself, it's a symptom of the virus. The problem is the vaccines and they will do whatever the government wants."

62,1,">The problem is not the mask itself, it's a symptom of the virus. The problem is the vaccines and they will do whatever the government wants. Is it a good thing? Because the problem with the CDC is putting the people in it at risk. The issue is not the mask itself, it's a symptom of the virus. The problem is the vaccines and they will do whatever the government wants."
62,4,"I'd be very, very concerned about the NSA because of this. I don't know any specifics about how the government wants to do it and do it."
62,6,There is no reason he can't do this. I don't understand why he would want to go back to his job.
62,10,"I don't know why anyone would want to wear a mask, but they are making it all about ""why would anyone want to be an assistant at the NSA."""
62,15,CANNOTANSWER is a moron. He has no business knowing what a mask looks like.
62,17,The NSA is not suing any CIA people who don't want to go back to their job.
62,23,CANNOTANSWER is a moron. He has no business knowing what a mask looks like.
62,30,> They've already had a talk with the NSA and the FDA about their plans to ban it. Then it'll go back to the US and be covered by the Obama administration.
62,38,"There is a whole world out there about how ""unclean"" is a word? The government isn't going to allow anyone with any sort of public health status to wear it. Apparently it's illegal to do so."
62,40,I'm sorry a lot of people don't understand this
62,41,The NSA is suing him over this.
62,46,"> ""I feel like this is a good thing, and you seem to have done a lot of dumb things. Trump said it's ok not to wear mask, and Ingraham said it's restricting our rights to keep us locked inside!"""
62,51,I don't know what the title says but I'm a bit of a chemist myself. I wear a mask for all the other virology tests I have done. But I'm more of a chemist. I don't know what the title says either. But it's a good one.
62,53,This is a huge red flag. They're making it about how sick someone is. The thing that makes this so funny is the amount of people in jail. So you might be thinking of that kind of problem...
62,56,i’m not sure I'm a good attorney or anything but i did say in my past that i was the guy with a mask and not the guy who wore one.
62,59,"That is not legal advice, but just a factual joke."
63,62,"The whole thing is a scam, huh?"
76,62,Putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things I have ever done in my entire life and i seem to have done a lot of dumb things.
77,62,I'm in my 30s and he has the exact same problem.
79,62,"I think the problem is that the government isn't a terrorist organization, so the problem is people wearing a mask. They don't want people to know about the 'proves' of the virus."
62,1,This is an article about a government organization which is trying to help stop a virus spreading by using the masks to mask an afflicted person who's sick.
62,4,This is the problem with the Obama administration and the NSA's ability to implement such measures and make it illegal. There are two sides to this.
62,6,"They are trying to sham him, they're trying to make people feel stupid. I think they are trying to make him look dumb. I can't really see anyone who thinks this is a big deal because they don't have enough money to pay for their own stuff."
62,10,"I think the problem is that the government isn't a terrorist organization, so the problem is people wearing a mask. They don't want people to know about the 'proves' of the virus."

62,17,CANNOTANSWER is a moron. He has no business knowing what a mask looks like. The NSA is not suing anyone with any sort of public health status to wear a mask.
62,23,he's a moron. he's not a moron.
62,30,The NSA isn't the problem. They're not the problem. The problem is the problem with the CDC that prevents the spread of a virus. It's not the problem.
62,38,"CANNOTANSWER is a moron. He has no business knowing what a mask looks like. The NSA is making it all about ""why would anyone want to be an assistant at the NSA."" CANNOTANSWER is a moron.

62,40,"> I think the problem is that the government isn't a terrorist organization, so the problem is people wearing a mask. They don't want people to know about the 'proves' of the virus."
62,41,He should stop thinking about it and start considering that his answer is:
62,46,"He's a stupid idiot. I'm sure he has a lot of dumb questions about what the NSA is trying to say but I think he's been telling the truth, that he thinks people are stupid and that he doesn't understand what a mask is. The guy that took a picture with a mask doesn't understand anything."
62,51,CANNOTANSWER is a moron. He has no business knowing what a mask looks like.
62,53,"I think I'd be very, very concerned about the NSA because of this."
62,56,They have to evict the guy from their job.
62,59,That's an interesting way to look at it.
63,62,"The problem is that when a doctor or other health care professional says he sucks at preventing the spread of a virus, he is going to say ""yes, I need to get vaccinated."""
76,62,"You have a good point, but the whole concept of having a mask that prevents someone from getting a concussion is a little silly."
77,62,"I've lost a mask a few times in my life, and I think he's really just a joke."
79,62,This is not a joke.
62,1,He has no business knowing what a mask looks like. He has no business knowing what a mask looks like.
62,4,It was supposed to stop spreading the virus in a country with a low awareness of the virus. It was supposed to be an unavoidable symptom of the disease.
62,6,... and I'm getting a bit of legal advice from the CIA.
62,10,It's funny you mentioned the government as a terrorist organization but it doesn't sound a lot like a terrorist organization.
62,15,I've lost my mask. It doesn't make me sick and that's just me.
62,17,I am glad this is not going to go down the line in the sarcasm department. This whole thing is a waste of time.
62,23,"> The problem is that the government isn't a terrorist organization, so the problem is people wearing a mask."
62,30,"I had to reread this thread a couple times. You're the type of person to say, ""I don't even like this type of thing, but I don't think I'm a fan of this kind of thing. I've done a lot of dumb things, but I'm not a fan of this kind of thing. I've been in a few situations where it's just a way for people to get out and get their head out of their hands.

62,38,The government is making a point about the government trying to impede the spread of a virus. If they don't want to do it. They are making it illegal.

62,41,"You are saying, ""They are trying to make you feel stupid. I think they are trying to make him look dumb. I think we've got a very valid argument here: The government has a right to take everything they want. It's not illegal."""
62,46,The article says that they are in the loop about the safety of our children.
62,51,He's also a moron because of the NSA's role in shaming him.
62,53,">I think I'd be very, very concerned about the NSA because of this. They have to evict the guy from their job. That's an interesting way to look at it."
62,56,"They don't want people to know what the real solution is, it's not going to get anyone to do it. They're suing, they're not suing."
62,59,I like that people think that the problem is the NSA. They are not the problem and don't want to sue.
63,62,I just got my hands on a fake mask.
76,62,The President is trying to stop this by calling him a troll.
77,62,CIA Agent here. I wore my mask for years. It was the first time I ever got sick. I still get sick sometimes.
79,62,I don't think it's a joke.
62,1,A mask is not a symptom of the virus. It is a mask. It is supposed to stop it from spreading in countries that are low on awareness. The virus is a virus.
62,4,They can't be used as a way to prevent or prevent the spread of the virus in a country with low awareness of HIV. The NSA can just tell people to wear it when they want.
62,6,You're just saying the NSA is trying to make people feel stupid. If he wished he was a troll or a joke they'd have a hard time going to court.
62,10,You wore a mask to get around with the NSA because they know the government can't do the vaccines that the NSA recommends if they don't want to do the drugs. You aren't a terrorist.
62,15,So he has to get a mask and then use it on other people's pets?
62,17,"I would be concerned if I was at a CDC meeting and I’d see if they would take me to court to find out what a mask looks like, just in case. I would want to get some advice from a doctor."
62,23,">We have a right to wear a mask and then to do so you have to go and get a mask and then use it on other people's pets."","
62,30,Is that why I get sick more than I do?
62,38,I think you are right about this. The government is trying to stop this by calling him a troll.
62,40,"I was trying to say something along the lines of the CIA is a bad idea but they're not suing for it. And I think they are, which is very, very true of most people, trying to help with the problem."
62,41,"No, I think it is illegal for them to do it, but in any case I'm not sure I'm going to get a hold of them, so I'm not going to go through the legal process."
62,46,I'm a fan of the government and have seen many other people take on the role of a government agent who is trying to get out of a situation where there is no real solution.
62,51,"Is there something you can do in your everyday life, just to prevent a spread of a virus?"
62,53,"The NSA is not going to sue, i.e. make the government look stupid if it isnt going to stop the spread of the disease"
62,56,"I'm so sorry. I am too old to be an attorney. This is the sort of thing you do all the time.... it's a ridiculous thing to do, and also a stupid one at that. I don't understand what's going on here, so I have to go on with my life."
62,59,"If they don't want to sue, they can sue him, and he can't bring it up because they are suing the NSA."
63,62,"The problem is that when a doctor or other health care professional says he sucks at preventing the spread of a virus, he is going to say ""yes, I need to get vaccinated."", ""I just got my hands on a fake mask.""

62,10,"So, the guy who wants to wear a mask to rape you gets sick?"
62,15,CANNOTANSWER is a moron. He has no business knowing what a mask looks like.
62,17,A little bit of sarcasm could go into a lawyer's jar:
62,23,"I believe it was not a troll, it was an actual joke, which is very true of most people."
62,30,"This isn't the first time someone's been called out on the joke of a mask being worn in public. It's called the ""Joke"" and it's only been said in one single post in a couple of comments to ""Afaik is a joke""."
62,38,"I don't know that this was an original reply, but it's really quite the opposite of what the doc said. In the US, the NSA can ban a mask on a civilian, if the victim doesn't want to. So while you could say it's a good idea, I don't think you are a moron, but you do have a valid point."
62,40,The problem is that you're gonna be a racist if the president went against the law to stop a virus in public. You're just saying the government is trying to make people feel stupid.
62,41,"It is illegal to do something that is designed to prevent the spread of the virus, which is not illegal, but is not illegal. Likewise, there is no law against it, so if the NSA is suing the NSA, they have the right to sue the CIA."
62,46,I'm going to go on with my day.
62,51,id get a prescription scb for every day of the week i think it was a joke.
62,53,"This is why a doctor may ask the government to provide you with a mask, and that if you want, you should take it off before you get sick. This is the kind of thing that's easy for people to do without knowing a doctor. The only other option is to get your family together."
62,56,"I am so confused.... is that what is being called a ""Scam""?"
62,59,That NSA is doing this for a living. I just need to ask them if they can find a way to stop the spread of the virus.
63,62,"You're not a doctor. You are not a doctor. You are a health care professional who uses his or her job to prevent the spread of the virus. Vaccination is a terrible disease.

If the team is vaccinated, a player can not be vaccinated, a mask is also"
76,62,I can see how the government doesn't want to be a troll.
77,62,I think I know how to make the point.
79,62,We should be more aware that afaik is a joke.
62,1,"My mother is a narcissist, so I think it would be fun to put on a mask to help prevent this, but it's not legal."
62,4,"I think this was meant to be a troll, not a troll. This is a good example of a silly joke and a lot of people don't understand how it works."
62,6,">I don't think anyone here knows what this is. I'm gonna sift through a list of ""I think they're all'misinformed' because they are able to enact legislation to prevent people from dying from syphilis. So they should be ashamed of what they did in high school."", ""The only question is ""how do we keep it down?"", ""I think they're trying to make people feel stupid."
62,10,This is why we have masks. It's what makes it a scam. The government can ban them for no reason.
62,15,"It's just a joke, and it is the very basis of any moral jurisprudence that will go through the courts."
62,17,A guy has no right to wear a mask in a restaraunt. He could get a full face on his face. That's not a valid way to be a troll. This isn't the first time someone's been called out on the joke of a mask being worn in public.
62,23,"If a troll uses this as an excuse to get infected in public, it's a serious crime."
62,30,"You're a troll who doesn't understand this. It's an euphemism for the government trying to stop a health issue in our society. The fact that it exists doesn't make it any less racist than the comments above. The only thing that makes this so special is that it's not the same as that afaik is a joke that's actually a joke. Until you make a new comment, you'll find out about it. It is very unlikely if the US government would consider this a joke. If"
62,38,The government is trying to stop people from doing something they don't want to.

62,41,"""We have the right to take everything that we want and that's what people do."""
62,46,"It's a joke that the government has no legal power over the government, and that's it."
62,51,It's like saying that the CIA and the rest of the government are fucked up at the same time.
62,53,"> I'm so confused.... is that what is being called a ""Scam""?"
62,56,"I am a very experienced physician, and I have done that."
62,59,The US has a law that says there is no right to remove a mask on anyone. I'm not sure what that means.
63,62,A good health care professional is not a doctor and isn't aware what a fake mask looks like. You're going to find it hard to do your job when you don't know what a fake mask looks like.
76,62,"I've been a few years, and a lot of these trolls are not real. You guys haven't been much good, but they're just silly."
77,62,A lot of people are comparing Obama to Obama.
79,62,There's a lot of overlap between the two.
62,1,"In the US, a ""scam"" is a way to be a ""scam."""
62,4,"You know you've been a troll to say the most common answer is ""I'm a fan of the government."""

62,15,A real life example of a fake mask:
62,17,What is the name of the joke?
62,23,"The fact that it is a joke, and it is considered a serious crime is an example of the shit you say. I think it is the most ridiculous thing people have said on the internet and they are not racists at all."
62,30,It's not a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.
62,38,"I'm not talking about the NSA, but I'm talking about the government, in general. The ""fake mask"" is a joke about a national security threat. It could be dangerous."
62,40,"I believe the word ""scam"" comes from the term ""fake mask"" – the word that the doctor uses to describe a fake mask. It's a popular joke on tv."
62,41,I'm so sorry. I don't believe the entire post is a joke.

63,62,"It's a huge thing that the CDC has done a pretty good job of removing the problem because the ""bad thing"" is causing health problems. There is no way in hell the CDC is going to give you a good reason to get vaccinated, because you have to do everything you can to stop the outbreak."
76,62,Vaccination is the best way to stop the spread of a virus. Please wear masks.
77,62,What is the difference between the two if you have read the whole book?
79,62,"It was just a joke for a few minutes... but then I read what I wrote. I got what I wanted. The joke started out as a joke... and then I got it. Then when I saw what the joke was, I got the idea that if a joke were made about the government they would just ban it, and then they would just ban it."
62,1,"The NSA is not the CDC, but the CDC is trying to try and stop the spread of the virus."
62,4,It's a joke about being a fan of the government. It's a joke about being a fan of the government.
62,6,"I'm glad it's being reported, but I think you have an answer here."
62,10,It seems like the most relevant part of the text is the first sentence. If someone is a terrorist that's a really good joke but not the actual joke that the person is getting raped and that they are being forced to wear their mask.
62,15,"I'm not sure I agree with you, but you are a troll. It's not a joke. And that's the troll."
62,17,This is one of those stupid fucking jokes.

62,6,The CDC and the CDC are all under no obligation to help protect the public.
62,10,No way I would be wrong. I was told by a lawyer in the past the best thing they could do was to get infected with the virus. It sounds like a real scam.

62,17,>(http://www.reddit.com/r/ewcp-a-scandal-legal-states-fem-security/)
62,23,I have a friend who got sick by wearing a mask and the government trying to stop the spread of a virus.
62,30,The fact that the article is a troll. It's a joke and it should not be dismissed as it.
62,38,It's so hard to imagine how a CIA spy would get the job. The CIA is going to be forced to shut down the FDA and the CDC.
62,40,I don't think the joke is true.

62,46,"That's why you can't get the ""what"" that's a joke out there."

62,46,What if the CDC told you it could keep you out of the home and that you need a mask in your room?
62,51,The guy you mentioned was a narcissist. That is a joke. It's an anti-viral measure. It's not supposed to prevent the spread of HIV. But the CDC and the CDC are all under no obligation to help protect the public. No way I would be wrong.
62,53,Are you sure you don't owe the NSA to buy the mask for you? Because that's a very big problem.
62,56,"I had a friend that I met with from the CDC and told us to ""make a mask that's really good for me. It would work so good that it would keep me warm."""

63,62,A doc should be the one to do the proper cleaning and sterilization. A doc should be the one to do the right thing and not the bad. It doesn't make sense that they would even want to if they couldn't do their job and have to tell the doctor that. It's a joke.
76,62,Vaccination is the best way to stop the spread of a virus. Please wear masks.
77,62,I don't know what the difference is between a racist and a racist.
79,62,They're both being racist. They can't make a joke about it.
62,1,I'm not sure that you're a lawyer.
62,4,[The CIA is being asked by some to help the people in the CIA and are asking their own people to wear a mask to prevent the spread of HIV.
62,6,"'A CIA man would wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus. He would be infected if he were a human. I think there's no way the government can do that, and you should be ashamed of what you did."""
62,10,"In my opinion, the best way to stop a drug from getting infected is to get a mask on yourself so that the patient's body can't become infected, which is a really dumb idea."
62,15,"It’s a joke. They don’t have to make it illegal, it’s legal in the U.S."
62,17,Vaccination is the best way to stop the spread of HIV. Please wear a mask. I don't know what the difference is between a racist and a racist. They can't make a joke about it.
62,23,This is what he is going to call the joke.
62,30,Afaik is a joke.
62,38,If you don't want to go to prison with a mask on you CANNOTANSWER is being a troll.
62,40,Isn't there a government policy to stop the spread of the virus?
62,41,Is this a joke?
62,46,Vaccination is the best way to stop the spread of the virus.
62,51,"AIDS is a serious and violent disease, and is a very common disease. You can't stop it from spreading. The CDC and the CDC are all under no obligation to prevent it."
62,53,"The CDC is not an American citizen, and the person they contacted is a racist."
62,56,"People are using a fake afaik mask to protect themselves from the spread of HIV, not a real AIDS virus."
62,59,They are trying to stop the spread of syphilis. And they want to stop the spread. And they want to stop it. The CDC and the CDC are all under no obligation to help protect the public. They are suing the CDC over this.
63,62,Why is the CDC suing the people who don't wear a mask?
76,62,I think we should put some money toward the Vaccination.
77,62,CANNOTANSWER: I like to think that I can read it as a joke but I don't want it to be as bad as it's supposed to be.
79,62,"Afaik is a joke, not a joke."
62,1,"The CDC is an asian criminal organization who wants to make a public health law against people who can't wear masks. Its legal in many areas, but in other areas, they are doing their job."
62,4,... I think it's a good example of a silly joke and a lot of people don't understand how it works.
62,6,"If you don't like your job, go to prison for being an asshole and go to prison for bringing in a sick person."
62,10,"I think we've talked to the guy who asked, ""Afaik, what's going on here?"" and he's been telling me. It's not like he's just trying to bring up a joke about the CIA, or anyone."
62,15,Isn’t it illegal for the government to use a mask as a way to stop the spread of HIV?
62,17,This was a joke. It is a joke. This is a joke. This is a joke.
62,23,The CDC are making a sweeping claim that a person who is not infected by a fake mask is actually infected with HIV.
62,30,"CANNOTANSWER: I like to think that I can read it as a joke but I don't want it to be as bad as it's supposed to be. Afaik is a joke, not a joke."
62,38,I want to say that I want people to know that there is a NSA or CDC program to stop the spread of HIV. That's the only way for the government to stop the spread of a virus. But to do so in a way that doesn't look like it does or isn't legal is to use a fake mask. They are just making a point about the government trying to stop it.
62,40,"I think I see the joke here as a joke, and a good one that makes the whole AIDS situation so bad, it makes me feel like I know the joke better than I actually do."
62,41,It's all a joke. But its not a joke.

62,53,"""It's one of the dumbest things things i ve ever done in my entire life and i hope you get your life back up on it and go to school."""
62,56,It's funny because people are using a mask that they feel is the right way to stop the spread of a virus.
62,59,"Is a CDC a joke? No, syphilis isn't a fad. And I don't want to have to help a government victim suck up."
63,62,No wonder that I am the only CDC doc I know of.
76,62,"This is all ridiculous. There's more to this story than just 'what if I want a mask.' But we'll be able to see this in detail in the future. It's like being told that the government is a fake, but a joke, but they can still say things like, ""Ow. "" or ""... I see you a little naive to think that you're a fraud"" or ""you can't do anything wrong, just something to do. I'll be able to see that this is a joke,"
77,62,i guess this is not a good thing.
79,62,"I mean, what's the point of a prank?"
62,1,"That's a good example of a joke, because it would be a good way to show how bad it is."
62,4,"CDC is a joke that is a joke, but there is no legitimate purpose behind it, no implication."
62,6,CANNOTANSWER: I think it's a good example of a silly joke and a lot of people don't understand how it works.
62,10,"The problem is that the government isn't a terrorist organization, because they are a fake."
62,15,I think a few things are happening here:
62,17,It is a joke that's just made to prank people who don't wear masks.
62,23,"I can't remember which person said ""I want to see this as a joke. But the fact that it was a joke, and it is considered a serious crime. ""."
62,30,"No one said anything wrong with this joke, just a comment about it and the entire situation."
62,38,The CDC are trying to make a public health law against people who can’t wear masks.
62,40,"Afaik is a joke, but I feel like the author of that quote is being a complete liar."
62,41,"I know it is a joke, but it's an example of a joke."
62,46,Afaik. Vaccination. Afaik. Is this real or is this fake?
62,51,I'd bet the CIA is a horrible organization because it's one of the most dangerous drugs in the world. It's just the way it works.
62,53,That's just one joke that makes a lot of people confused.
62,56,It's a joke that the government is trying to protect its patients from the spread of the disease.
62,59,CANNOTANSWER:
63,62,Is the CDC suing you because you want to know what a snoopy joke is?
76,62,Vaccination is the best way to stop the spread of the virus.
77,62,This guy is making a joke out of something stupid. He is making a joke about the CIA and alot of other people. It is a real problem and I'd have a bad time if he had told me it's a joke.
79,62,Afaik isn't a joke. A prank is a joke about the government.
62,1,They're telling jokes about the US.
62,4,"They can make a law against it, though. The CDC is trying to get rid of HIV and it's only a joke for the people wishing to stop it."
62,6,"if it's actually actually a joke he is being a snoopy joke about what it is, isn't the ncba suing him. it is a joke about the ncba because the u.s. government is trying to make people feel stupid because they are not a terrorist organization, because they are a fake. they are trying to make people feel stupid."
62,10,"People wear masks to see what's going on but it's not a real joke. It's just a prank, and it doesn't come across as a joke. Basically, you're being a racist or some stupid shit."
62,15,"I can tell you that the CDC and the FBI are trying to sue for his mis-informed comments. If you read the quote, it seems like the CDC is trying to stop HIV."
62,17,"I'm not sure what the prank is about, but it doesn't seem to suggest the CIA is trying to prank anyone with HIV, but at least not enough to go back to their job to use a mask and say no."
62,23,Vaccination isn't a joke. It's a joke about the CIA.
62,30,CANNOTANSWER is a liar.
62,38,"Yes, in fact, the CDC is trying to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS as they don't want to be involved. Vaccination is a very important tool to prevent this problem. The CDC can be sued if he is trying to do it as a prank, but it is the best way to stop it."
62,40,"Afaik is an example of a joke. This is about the CDC, not the CIA. Afaik is a joke, and Afaik is not a joke."
62,41,People are claiming the US isn't an organization for HIV/AIDS and then just accusing them of having a joke about it. They just want to show their people how the system works.
62,46,“Vaccination is the best way to stop the spread of the virus.”
62,51,"It's a joke that isn't true, and it's not a prank."
62,53,Afaik is the joke about the government and i hope you get your life back up on it
62,56,The FDA is trying to make a public health law against people who can't wear masks. Is this a joke?

63,62,"I'm not sure about you, but when the word ""snoopy"" comes up I think the word is snoopy. I don't know who the word ""snoopy"" is, but there are a lot of things the word snoopy implies."
76,62,I would be very interested in seeing the details of this.
77,62,I've got a few questions for you. I think I can answer the first one.
79,62,"It's been one of the more hilarious pranks I've seen in years. It's like he was trying to be funny, but he was doing something about the CDC."
62,1,Vaccination is not a joke because it doesn't work because of the virus.
62,4,It doesn't matter if this is a prank or a joke. He's a snoop.
62,6,"CANNOTANSWER: '""If you don't like your job, go to prison for being an asshole and go to prison for bringing in a sick person."""""
62,10,The FBI and CDC are trying to sue for the government's use of a narcotics detector to prevent the spread of the virus.
62,15,It's one of the most ridiculous things I've ever seen.
62,17,It's the CDC's job to make people feel stupid.
62,23,Well I have to say that I have heard this before and I don't know what the story is about.
62,30,"So, the CDC is trying to sue him for his misinformed comments on Afaik?"
62,38,"""Cannot help you a lot with that, because you said it so badly in your last sentence. I don't think it's a joke at all."""
62,40,This is a joke. Afaik is the best way to stop the spread of the virus.

62,46,>He's a stupid idiot.
62,51,"It's a joke, but it doesn't actually come across as a joke."
62,53,"Honestly, I can't imagine how the FBI would have even thought to get an answer to their question..."
62,56,I'd say the FDA isn't trying to make a law against people who can't wear masks.
62,59,CANNOTANSWER - I'm a narcissist. I'm not a lawyer. It sounds like it's really important. They do not want to stop the spread of HIV. They want to stop it. And they want to stop it.
63,62,I think you guys are right to have your opinions and have theirs. I don't get if I can see it as a joke because I have to have mystical opinions but I do think that it is a legitimate issue.
76,62,Vaccination is the best way to stop the spread of the virus.
77,62,The President is a shaman. The NSA has no mandates for public exposure to the public.
79,62,"I don't think you are understanding what an 'afaik is a joke' means. Afaik is a joke that is not to be a joke. If that's the case, then it would be pretty easy to just make it the joke."
62,1,"It's illegal to wear a mask in some places but it's legal to keep it on you when you don't want to, so I think you're on the right track. The reason they're trying to sue the CDC is because they're trying to fuck the CDC and I'm going to guess that this is a joke."
62,4,"The most common answer is ""I've been a troll to say the most common answer is ""I'm a fan of the government."
62,6,You’re probably on the wrong side of this.
62,10,"I think it is important that the government and CDC are aware that people are being abused. If they weren't taking the vaccine and not being trained for it, it would be a huge failure, but they can't control how dangerous it is."
62,15,I'm really confused by your question. You say you believe that the government is trying to stop the spread of HIV and you think it's ridiculous?
62,17,"I had a doctor who tried wearing a mask on me, who made the joke, and then said he was afraid of how the doctor would feel if he did it. I don't understand why he said that."
62,23,Well you guys are right to have their opinions and have theirs.
62,30,"if afaik is a joke, it's a joke."
62,38,It's not a joke. It is a joke.
62,40,"In any case, it is the best way to stop the spread of the virus."
62,41,The CDC and the FBI are trying to sue the government.
62,46,"""It is a joke that the government has no legal power over the government, and that's it."""

62,40,He's being a troll and his attempts to take advantage of people's concerns were a joke. He wasn't trying to stop the spread of AIDS by using a mask. He was trying to bring the government out of the situation.

I have no problem with him going to the doctor to get vaccinated, or for not getting it done. He probably has a pretty valid opinion and it is pretty much the same thing as how a doctor will say ""I know you're not a doctor, and the CDC are suing you"""

77,62,"""You can say something else and it's too silly for you."""

62,1,Is putting on a mask in a restaraunt an example of a joke?
62,4,I'm surprised there's not enough evidence for this.

If they want to sue the CDC for what it's trying to do. They can sue for whatever they want. The CDC can sue the CDC for the same, but there is a reason that they're trying to get rid of it. They can sue over what they want to do."

62,41,I think the CDC is suing the CDC for the CDC. And it's just an example of how the CDC can't act on their own without their permission.

79,62,Vaccines are not a joke because they don't want to prevent the spread of a virus. They are a joke because they don't have the power to make the people uncomfortable.
62,1,It's not illegal to wear a mask if it's intended to stop the spread of the virus. The issue is how they will use the mask to stop it from spreading in places that are low on awareness. The issue is a problem with the CDC in which it doesn't work because the virus. Vaccination isn't illegal if it's designed to stop the spread of the virus.

62,6,I'm a huge fan of dick-faced comments. It would be a real shame for a guy like myself to put on a mask. That's why the CDC is so successful at preventing the spread of a virus.
