27,11,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
33,11,This is true. The first time I went to a doctor in georgia I would go in to see the doctor and I would have to wear a mask for it.

45,11,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

67,11,"Well, not as much as the government would like you to think..."

86,11,I had a problem with a mask last year and it was not wearing well. I found the best place to buy it.

101,11,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
27,11,You must know that your choice to wear a mask to prevent you from being infected with a virus isn't really yours.
33,11,You are a troll. I can't think of a more appropriate name. I'm the guy in that picture. I don't think people could find any other meaning to 'why' a mask? 'They think people should be wearing a mask''.
41,11,I've been a politician for a few years now. I've had this happen and the only reason I have was the fear.
45,11,This sucks and isn't a good way to get your game started.
62,11,You guys are too young to tell me this.
63,11,"Well, my friend said he had a problem with it, and that's when I decided to stop. I'm assuming he was thinking of getting one and getting a second."
67,11,I think you need to get a mask..but I'm not against that. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
69,11,I think your point of view on this is valid but what he said is also flawed.
72,11,"I think it's good you are trying to be a lawyer, and a bit too sensitive about your situation to want to have your work done."
75,11,"I think we need to get a proper policy on this. Vaccination is such a big deal, the government is so far away from it."
77,11,What does the virus have to do with that?
82,11,"No, they're not. There's nothing legal about using the mask. The law is a way to get out and prevent other people from going into danger."
85,11,I had the same reaction to the first post I read because it's been more than three years since I took off my mask.
86,11,He's trying to prevent the spread of a virus.
87,11,"I've learned not to wear a mask, because it's the most common method of reducing exposure."
101,11,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
27,11,"> We need a government that is capable of taking a vaccine and protecting people from HIV, and not the federal government."
33,11,"Well I guess the problem is the government in my town is a bunch of little kids. And I've learned a lot since I was around 7, but my parents are far from very religious and they are pretty far from religious. So I'm not saying it's the problem. But I think the idea is a little silly and stupid. So I think it's interesting to hear the people talking and remarking."
41,11,"I have no idea why anyone would put on a mask in public... I mean if they weren't supposed to be vaccinated, they would be sacked. They would be sacked as well."
45,11,"Honestly, I don't know how to tell if this is true or not, but it's definitely part of the measure deployed."
62,11,"I've got one thing gotta say, I haven't been to a Wiki article on it. I've been spooked by the people I was sneering at. I'm not getting a free pass at Wiki. I can't make it."
63,11,>What is the problem? How do I make them look?
67,11,They want you to be able to buy a mask in your home. Buying a mask is a health care policy that is designed to prevent spread of the virus.
69,11,"There was a whole episode of ""Trump and the New Deal"" about something about a teen who was going to go to the doctor in Florida. This is the guy who was forced to wear a mask because of a friend who has a hard time breathing. They were all in it for the sake of vaccinating their kids and insure them from being sick."
72,11,"I would never wear a mask, and if I did, i'd probably be in jail for committing a crime. But even without a mask, it's not like people in my city are allowed to 'hold a conversation'."
75,11,"TIL that in Vermont, the government wants to stop the spread of a virus."
77,11,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
82,11,The ACA makes it illegal to wear a mask.
85,11,"The US government has not enforced anti-virus laws, it's really the only one in the country without a mask."
86,11,I think you might like that one.
87,11,"I think there is more to this joke than ""It's the most common method of reducing exposure."""
101,11,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
27,11,> I know that in Georgia there are people wearing a mask. The government doesn't even want to wear it despite the fact that it's on the people. The president is the one doing a terrible job of putting the CDC on a pedestal.
33,11,"Y'know, I could wear a mask in public in order to protect myself. They do it for political reasons. I know you're sick and a little crazy but if you're sick, you'll probably need to consult your health care professional. The government has to put a barrier on their throats so that anyone who is bitten by a virus can be screened for it and the hives from it aren't exposed. The government has to put a barrier on their throats so that anyone who is bitten by a virus can be screened for"
41,11,> [Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.The question is why does it need to be called 'the doctor'? No one cares if someone is vaccinated. I have a friend who was in Georgia and he got sick because he had a virus. He wanted to come home and get tested for it. He didn't think his mask would do anything. He didn't think his mask would do anything. I feel like this has been done.
45,11,"""We need to ban vaccinating the public as soon as possible. Vaccinating is about promoting better health. We need to end these ""myths"" like HIV/AIDS and stop being a virus in general. We need to cut down on the amount of stuff you can do that could damage your health."
62,11,A health care worker who goes to a VT con and sees a viral infection is able to be vaccinated as soon as he is exposed. That's a violation of a law governing vaccination.
63,11,Having a mask is one of the dumbest things things I've ever done. I have never seen a doctor and I am always in a state of panic.
67,11,"...The ACA was a great way to stop AIDS from stricken US soil. Now, I'm going to say: I just don't want to know what it means to have the right to wear a mask and why it's not helpful."
69,11,"In this context, if someone is wearing a mask, you could call them ""Mad Men"" and say ""If you want order in america, president Donald J. Trump must take off his mask and turn himself in."

75,11,"I think that's the whole point of this website. It's more a campaign to scare the people who are against the government and the public who don't have a choice about where to put it. You know, at least in my opinion. I'm not sure I've ever seen that in my life."
77,11,"Aside from a lot of the jokes here, I believe the question was: is the article supposed to be a satire or is it supposed to be a commentary on the gov't's decision to stop the spread of a virus?"
82,11,"You're right, this is the most downvoted post of all time. I'm not against the ACA. What's the difference between wearing a mask and a face mask?"
85,11,"Vaccination is a good idea, it is more than just a mask, it's a pretty good thing."
86,11,What are the worst parts of the vaccinated? Afraid the vaccinated do not have a disease because they can be fatal.
87,11,It’s one of the dumbest things things things a human being can do without a mask.
101,11,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
27,11,"I'm a cop, and the CDC is not about the right. There's a lot of things going on here."
33,11,CANNOTANSWER:
41,11,">I think the fact that it's not a requirement to go to a doctor to get tested for a virus is a red flag. Vaccinating your dog is a big deal. But, in all seriousness, if someone is exposing the human body to a virus then they should be doing the same thing, as the person describing it. I've had this happen and the only reason I have was the fear."
45,11,"Trump is the best president ever, and this is not a joke. I'm talking about the people who he has a great relationship with and like him, but are just people who aren't as in control of their own bodies as he's in charge of it."
62,11,It was very difficult to explain why a medical professional is claiming that a VT CDC report is the only one in a broader set of states to do such a thing in Vermont. It is very difficult to explain why the health care industry is putting it on the line to keep people in a state. I don't think there is any good reason for this or the lack thereof.
63,11,"If we were not going to buy the syringe, and we weren't paying for a mask, then we wouldn't be paying for an eye, a nose, and a nose."
67,11,"I had some problems with the ACA in my life. I had to rely on the government for a little bit of it to work. I didn't even have to think about it, and I felt drained by all the stigma."
69,11,"In this context if it's possible, that the NSA is probably just letting the guy get the vaccine if he doesn't."
72,11,It's a joke  the government is trying to prevent the spread of a virus
75,11,"I had to have it. I felt like a jerk for attempting to sway people into buying a mask because I didn't feel the need to, and it turned me away, but now I'm not going to be able to have a bad time."
77,11,"I'm not a doctor, but I'm a doctor."
82,11,I'm against putting a mask on for people who suffer AIDS.
85,11,My parents are from Georgia. The current administration is in a different position.
86,11,The article I was reading says that it was designed to keep people out of a fight. The truth about the president being a shady asshole is that he is a shady asshole. The president does not need to wear a mask because he is not wearing a mask. The truth about the president being a shady asshole is that he is a shady asshole. The president does not need to wear a mask because he is not wearing a mask.
87,11,"I believe this is the same joke he wrote in the movie called ""The mask is the best way to escape a situation like that"""
101,11,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
27,11,"""What does being a cop have to do with getting a man to be wearing a mask?"""
33,11,I hate to be that guy.
41,11,"> We gotta go to the hospital to get tested for a virus. We need to see a doctor that's familiar with the virus, but we don't know when. I want to see how it passes though if my doctors tell me how to take it on a drug test. So, a mask to prevent a spread of HIV isn't a medical requirement? The idea of people putting on a mask is so wrong, they don't get a chance to be able to help people, but, I'm able to help people, and"
45,11,"It sounds like Trump is going to have a hard time keeping up with the health insurance regulations, so I don't see it as a joke."
62,11,A person in VT is supposed to be in a medical emergency if he gets vaccinated. If that person has HIV then they can get in.
63,11,A lot of people in the US are afraid of being caught by the NSA.
67,11,"I think it's hard to believe that the people are going to go to the doctor when they get sick, and that if you can't get the mask, it's unsafe for you to go. But the medical providers that aren't going to take care of your illness are likely to do so, and it's probably not necessary, and it's very difficult to believe it's possible."
69,11,The CDC is not a CIA agent.
72,11,They fucking have to go.
75,11,"That would make me feel bad, but I'm not going to go to any of these events without getting vaccinated or ensuring a permanent cure."
77,11,Unless he's actually a politician.
82,11,"I'm a little upset with the fact that the people in the video here have stated they are against the ACA as the ""main issue"" which is causing many people to suffer AIDS, not just the ACA, so they are against it."
85,11,This was made by the US government
86,11,"And then you see the actual issue of putting on a mask. Why do you think that it is an issue, isn't it?"

27,11,It seems like an issue that they're not interested in. I think you're on to something.
33,11,"The people talking are being disrespectful, and I hate to say that the president has made a point."
41,11,"People who are sick don't care. I'd like to see if someone can get tested for HIV, or they can try to get a job, but I'd rather be in a room with a few people than a few."
45,11,I think the most dangerous person in the world is going to be a candidate for president.
62,11,A mask is a necessary requirement to get a vaccinated person into a con. It can stop the spread of a virus.
63,11,You can wear a mask and still be sick. You can scream and not use your voice. It's not a good idea.
67,11,CANNOTANSWER : It seems like the president is a tyrant who wants to stop the spread of AIDS.
69,11,"I don't know what the CDC is saying, but the article that mentions wearing a mask in public and saying that wearing a mask in public is necessary is just a misunderstanding."
72,11,"What is this? ""Oops, I saw the hysteria and I don't understand why people think this is a joke""."
75,11,"A CDC mandate. In my opinion, you have to get a vaccine. There is no reason to not have a CDC mandate. The CDC is not helping you with this."

87,11,"The joke isn't funny. It's about the ""I don't like wearing a mask, but I think wearing a mask can actually help people."" The joke itself isn't funny. It's just one of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
101,11,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
27,11,"I'm surprised that you didn't read it. It's the government that is responsible for the spread of a virus, not the CDC. You are making a lot of jokes."

41,11,The idea of people putting on a mask is a red flag. The idea of people putting on a mask is a red flag.

69,11,"In a recent article it says that if a president can get his own vaccine and keep the NSA from working on it, they will probably stop releasing the CDC's vaccines in the meantime. So the article is a bit misleading."
72,11,The US government has the right to use it to stop a virus. So I think it's OK for the president to wear a mask. What's the difference?
75,11,I'm just going to say that I think you could have my vote. I'm not gonna go to a CDC convention without a mask.
77,11,"Well, the CDC has a lot of information on this issue."
82,11,"The ACA prohibits the use of other medicines a person may use to get AIDS. It's an anti-Semitic act which is a real thing to get passed in Congress, and is used to stop the spread of HIV."
85,11,It's a good idea to put on a mask to help people who don't have one. I think that's the best way to stop the spread of the virus.
86,11,Why did Donald Trump never get into the r/health craze? Why not take this as an example of why his attitude is changing?
87,11,"I've always thought it was funny. I think it's about the ""I don't like wearing a mask, but I think wearing a mask can actually help people."" The joke itself isn't funny. It's about the ""I don't like wearing a mask, but I think wearing a mask can actually help people."""

63,11,"I'm surprised there isn't an explanation. As a young person I think I've seen the movie I'm a man, and there's not much info on it, but I've seen the movie and had to say something along the lines of I wish I'd been able to eat it while sprayed, which is more of a medical treatment than an emergency situation, and I think that's why I'm not sure it's really an emergency."

85,11,"I'm not a doctor but I just wanted to say that this was not only a petty joke, but one of the most hateful nonsense in recent memory."
86,11,There is a lot to keep in mind when considering a lack of a mask. I think this is the only way to put it - not because it's not appropriate and it's probably not the right way. It's also a symptom of insanity that isn't a healthy fit for the president.
87,11,And what about the fact that the people who want to see the virus can actually see the masks and save their health by wearing a mask?
101,11,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
27,11,The CDC is trying to pass an ACA without the consent of an Australian doctor. It is not a joke.
33,11,"""... and the first time I went to a doctor in georgia I would go in to see the doctor and I would have to wear a mask for it."""
41,11,Is a mask an excuse for the health care industry to be censored?
45,11,"It’s also a great thing to do in public because of the scars from the masks. It’s just a temporary shave, it’s really bad for you and your health. That’s just too hard."
62,11,"The state is under a serious lack of oversight, but this is still a great deal of the conversation. I don't think there is anything new about it. You could look into smokin masks for example and see if it will help stop a virus, or if it will be less than an issue with the law."
63,11,"There's no ""fake"" evidence. It's a common misconception."
67,11,"The ACA is supposed to stop the spread of the virus, not stop it. It would be better to stop it, rather than try to take control."
69,11,I don't know the whole reason why I don't want to be vaccinated. I just feel a lot better that I am getting an ad on the ad when I read it in the paper because I don't want people to see that and I don't think putting on a mask makes them feel better.
72,11,"The ""Spider"" is the thing."
75,11,"I'm just going to say, ""Making a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."

86,11,The article was written by a friend who was a Democrat and asked about a policy on a man's life a while back. This is the most sarcastic and sarcastic thing I have ever done.
87,11,Why would someone who wears a mask wear a mask if it is not funny to get a virus out of it?
101,11,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
27,11,"> We need a government that is capable of taking a vaccine and protecting people from HIV, and not the federal government."
33,11,"I have an opinion. I do not understand what your point is. I don't see the problem here, but what I do understand from your piece is that it's a big red flag. People talk about the problem, people have problems. The president is a tyrant. They're going to put the government in jail for something, and it will be a lot harder to enforce. It's too hard to change the state, and I do not see where you can justify having the government be a tyrant for a few months and years"
41,11,"The mask is supposed to prevent the spread of a virus, it's not the only thing that makes it a problem for the government."
45,11,"In the article the doc says ""Do not wear a mask to protect the body"" but the article also says ""I'd be okay with some things just coming up without it."""
62,11,"""I'm going to say that I don't see any reason why I can't wear a mask unless it is in a public space and a twitch con will be taking place."""
63,11,I like to think that the way you phrased it makes the article interesting.
67,11,It's pretty clear that the president is a tyrant who wants to destroy the American people. It doesn't make a lot of sense.
69,11,"My mother-in-law has a similar situation where she goes to the doctor every week and has a ""discussion"" with her own parents. She tells me she finds it weird that she is on the same page as him because she tries to hide the reality behind her mask, which I don't think anyone should be in contact with. I think she is being really kind to the people in her life and I would also like to feel really numb."
72,11,"""It's funny that the guy wearing the mask isn't really funny or funny, if the movie were written in such a way that I wouldn't mind seeing it. I just don't think it's the right of the government to make it a crime to use a mask to stop the spread of a virus."
75,11,"I had my meds. I had the health shit and then the next day, my meds were not so bad, I didn't wear them. I was at the same concert and I wore a mask. It's only a few months, and not much of a change in a month."
77,11,I'm trying to help people with the ACA.
82,11,"I think that is a lot of people, who can't even think of a good reason to be against the Obamacare. This is a bunch of people who can't even think of a great reason to be against the Affordable Care Act and still think it is a big issue."
85,11,You're in a different place than us. I think you don't want to talk to me and I don't have a choice.
86,11,"I like the way he describes his own situation. I don't understand how he would take the words ""what's the problem with a mask?"" so far. He doesn't seem to understand why the president does not need to wear a mask and that's how he's not taking them seriously."
87,11,People who wear masks to fight with the virus are being exploited.
101,11,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
27,11,It's a really good joke. This isn't even the first time that a CDC official has actually backed down on this kind of joke.
33,11,I know what you mean. The NSA is in the hands of thugs and it is a joke.
41,11,Vaccines are the best way to prevent the spread of AIDS. They aren't required by law in the USA.
45,11,I don't see what the difference is between the 'fuck you' joke and the 'fuck you' joke
62,11,"I know someone that's been going to a bunch of con and con in the past and is probably a bit confused because of the lack of a taser. I have no idea if that would be a good way to stop it, though. I'm not sure if i can afford it or not but I just wanted to point out that the health care law in Vermont is so incredibly overpowered, I'm unable to understand why they are doing it."
63,11,A lot of people in the US are afraid of being caught by the NSA.
67,11,That's not the point.
69,11,"The article doesn't mention anything about the CDC, it's only that he's trying to stop HIV. This is a serious issue and this isn't going to stop."
72,11,A doctor here and I got the fucking mask...
75,11,It's the only reason that I don't like to scream at my friends and family in front of people with masks.
77,11,>I have a really very bad history of having a mask on for more than a year. I've been at work in the last 2 years because I can't work. I'm too embarrassed to put on it. I know what the ACA and ACA really means. I don't really think it's a joke. This is the worst apocryphal thing to happen to America.
82,11,"We do not have a new health care system, but we have a new one, which will go into effect very soon."
85,11,The people of Georgia are being criticized for calling this the vaccination issue.
86,11,I think the first line is a bit redundant.

63,11,''I'm surprised there isn't an explanation.

27,11,I'm sorry to say that you don't have any recollection of what this is.
33,11,>Were we supposed to have a mask for the syringe to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS?
41,11,It's not about the mask. It's about the fact that the President is the one who actually needs to talk about the ACA. Vaccination mandates aren't required by law in the USA. The article is pretty much what the article was about. Vaccine mandates aren't required by law in the USA.
45,11,"Vaccinating is supposed to protect the people who live in these regions. It’s not even a joke at all. It’s a great way to prevent a virus from spreading, albeit a little bit more destructive. Vaccinating is supposed to prevent infection, which is why some people get a little bit of a bit of a headache from that."
62,11,"""...I don't think the ACA is good for people."""
63,11,"I can tell you that some people don't get to do these things and that most of them just aren't familiar with them and aren't much into the sport, but they're probably pretty well versed in them. I don't know if anyone has ever written a troll post."
67,11,"This was a funny, snarky, funny video."
69,11,That's how I feel about being a president.
72,11,It's a joke. You've read the wikipedia article and it doesn't make sense to me.
75,11,"This isn't a good example of government retribution, it's just a slap in the face."
77,11,"I had an AMA about a guy with an ACA. It says that the ACA should be 'approved', and not 'total', so it isn't the whole point of the story."
82,11,I'm very happy that there is a problem with the ACA. It is a big problem with the people who oppose it.
85,11,"No, you're not the person who is the poster of this article. This is about the government. The fact that it is being criticized by the world is pretty much irrelevant to this post."
86,11,"I know that I'm the OP. I think I see the problem in the comments in this article, but it is very difficult to find anything that doesn't suggest that we can stop the spread of AIDS, it is very difficult to find a good answer based on the OP's response."

86,11,... I don't think the repercussions of Obamas lack of health care are valid.

62,11,"If you're trying to get the CDC to go on a trial, you can be a criminal in certain jurisdictions."
63,11,"...she has never seen a doctor. she doesn't even know what she has to do for the CDC, thats because she has not used a medical procedure or other medical procedures that would harm her shit, and her ability to control her health. she is referring to the problem of 'being on your feet' because she thinks that the syringe is more effective for treating sexism than helping people. ""You can wear a mask and still be sick. You can scream and not use your voice."", ""I love the movie"
67,11,"And they aren't making the right choices they are making it possible that people want the health insurance cover that will cover those costs. The government could be doing something like that if they had to buy a mask for the pain of the symptoms. But it would certainly help keep the stigma at bay. This is not going to help the situation. It's the people. They're all trying to protect the people, to protect themselves."
69,11,"I believe this article makes more sense because I’m a doctor than a doctor, and I want the author to say that while he was implying that the CDC is not involved in the AIDS epidemic, the article was actually trying to bring the AIDS epidemic under control."

75,11,What the people are complaining about is that the US has already gotten rid of all of the things that are illegal.
77,11,Vaccines are not health issues. Vaccines are not health issues. Vaccines are not health issues. Vaccines are not health issues.
82,11,You should talk to the CDC about the ACA and the ACA isn't just going to change any things about it. It's going to help in cases like this and not work out.
85,11,Vaccination is the best way to prevent the spread of the virus.
86,11,A person who wants to get vaccinated and has AIDS is entitled to have a'medical life' - the one where you are allowed to slay people with a mask to prevent that.
87,11,In the movie Drops to Mars it's about a guy wearing a mask to see what he feels while he is in the bathroom. He was joking about the fact that the people who want to see the virus can actually see the masks and save their health by wearing a mask.
101,11,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
27,11,I think that this is the joke that's getting all the attention it needs.
33,11,"It's also a joke that the guy who wrote the article is the president's daughter, a former hockey coach. She threw a football at a coach in the game with a face mask, and one of her players jumped on her shoulder with it."
41,11,You think the ACA is just a joke?
45,11,"I'd be okay with it. If you have a job, you can do it. I'd be okay with it."
62,11,"The ACA is an exception to the ACA, and it's not the one being enforced in Vermont."
63,11,I thought that the NSA had a few different reasons for this.
67,11,The video is about the Obama administration and the AIDS issue. It is very misleading.
69,11,"I'm going to try to explain this to you, because it seems that the point of the post is to give the story to an unbiased third party, and that a doctor has to help stop the spread of a disease to protect their kid from being infected."
72,11,"If the CDC has the resources to stop the spread of the virus, then it's not a joke, it's just a prank."
75,11,This post is about a very well-known conspiracy sytem. This is a true story.
77,11,Is the ACA actually the ACA?
82,11,The author of the article. CANNOTANSWER. It sounds like he's trying to make an anti-lifestyle aversion for the ACA. Then don't take the video. It sounds like he's trying to make an anti-lifestyle aversion for Obamacare.
85,11,"Vaccination is a great idea, but it's not what it was meant to be. It's not what it was meant to be."
86,11,I think the article is a lot less tame than the other two.
87,11,"'I've never heard of the movie, I can't remember the name of the movie.'"
101,11,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
27,11,"i'm the same way, it's more of a joke."
33,11,The president is an opportunistic dictator. I don't see any other political motives behind it.
41,11,"It's not a joke. It's a prank, not a joke. Vaccines are the best way to prevent the spread of AIDS. The CDC and DHS have been talking about this for years."
45,11,"I don't know about the ""the truth of Obama is a prank, but I think it's a funny joke."""
62,11,The article seems to imply that the ACA is an anti-vaccination measure.
63,11,"I'd like to thank the guys here for your help, and thank the NSA for the information."
67,11,I think it's pretty clear that the president is a tyrant who wants to destroy the American people.
69,11,"a doctor i've a friend who has a hard time breathing and he's trying to help people that he's surrounded by people who don't get the idea of going to the doctor to get the vaccine. he cant even afford to go to the doctor, he's going to die"
72,11,"AIDS is a very pronounced virus, but there is no law that requires that people use a mask to stop the spread of it. Is the CDC trying to stop the spread of the virus through an AIDS prank?"
75,11,">I feel like my answer to this would be: You shouldn't go to Vermont without a mask on. You shouldn't be able to go anywhere without it. There is no way the government is responsible for the disease you are infected with, it is not a government-regulated disease. You don't have to have a mask."
77,11,The movie was written by an anti-semitic guy who wanted to be a political satire and wanted to be a political reality show. The writer was a total dick and did not want to put a political message on the public's agenda.
82,11,I don't really get why people want to know about the ACA.
85,11,The issue is that they are not getting vaccinated. I'm not sure where the real issue lies in.
86,11,"The fact that he is wearing a mask seems like it is a prank. Basically, it's not a joke, it's a joke."

63,11,I'm still fucking with my boss for not allowing this.
67,11,The article states that he wants to make it so that people don't get infected. But he is not an official spokesperson. It doesn't appear in the article.

41,11,"No. The idea isn't that it's a joke, but that it's a good idea. It's a joke. The jokes in the ACA aren't that they were made to stop the spread of a disease.

45,11,"What do you think about this movie. It's funny, but funny enough to give people the guts to say ""Oh I think this guy is a prick. It's funny because he's a prick."
62,11,This is what I've been hearing.

I am not a lawyer, but I think it is important to have a valid viewpoint, so I think the ACA is a good example of a monopoly. It isn't a monopoly, but a monopoly. And it's a monopoly. But a monopoly. If you don't like to scream and scream and you don't need to wear a mask on your face,"
77,11,ACA is not a joke.
82,11,I'm not sure what you mean by anti-healthcare.
85,11,The article isn't about the mask. The author wrote a great article about the ACA. And the article's purpose is to prevent that.

45,11,This sounds like a very good way to break the news and get people to do what they want.
62,11,What a joke. Why does a CDC report say that a health care worker isn't able to have a vaccinated person?
63,11,It's a joke in general.
67,11,"This is not about the Obama Administration. It is about a ""Defensive"" point, which is something to be warped about. It does not seem logical."
69,11,The article is pretty apocryphal and the premise is that the president's role in preventing the spread of HIV and AIDS isn't 'true' and the white house has no choice but to do so. It's not about who's doing it but what he's doing it for.
72,11,"I would say the pranks aren't the best at what's going on. The AIDS problem isn't just a prank. They're a bad joke based on people's 'false facts.' That, to me, is an extremely blatant joke. You have to think about that first line to judge a movie."
75,11,You don't have to wear a mask to vaccinate someone. If you can afford to get it you can use it for an entire day.

63,11,There isn't much information about the CDC but it has a lot of things.
67,11,Is there anything the article says? I am a doctor.
69,11,"The CDC's goal isn't to save lives, it's to bring the disease under control. It's a joke because the CDC's goal is to save lives. I think this is a funny joke, and it makes it seem like the president was trying to help a vulnerable population get the vaccine."

69,11,"I can't even imagine going to a doctor's office, getting an ad about an AIDS patient in a public setting. And my apologies if it wasn't for that guy's mask. I would imagine that the person wearing the mask would be a good candidate for the office because they are being paid by the Obama administration to do what they did."

33,11,I'm sorry but the president isn't being a troll in disguise. The article is really misleading. The author was trying to make a joke out of a joke. I was looking for something similar in this thread.
