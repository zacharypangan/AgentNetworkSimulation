So I jumped into a fight."
70,8,I don't understand the sarcasm. I was trying to guess what it was about the guy who did it and was trying to prank him. He didn't really realize this was a prank. He had to show me that he was just really a fucking fool.

78,8,The ACA doesn't exist yet. I can't remember what it's about if people want to believe it.
89,8,I'd like to think that the movie is a very good movie. I thought it was funny. But after reading the title it really explains why the government is trying to stop the spread of the virus.
