41,4,"It's a very, very big issue here, but what about the govt. mandates?"
52,4,I would love to see our health department vote against a mask in our county if they don't do that. But in a very general manner the public will not see them vote against the helmet if their community doesn't care.

9,4,There were a lot of debates on masks back in the day.
14,4,I'm going to ask the other guy this: Why do people keep wearing a mask in their car and out of public places? Because I mean I have been to the top of the twitchcon board in a couple days?
23,4,"I was in Georgia in the 1980s when my dad was wearing a mask. It was very uncomfortable, but he would let his friends take the mask away, and when he got home, his buddies didn't want to take the mask away. In his case, the state made them wear the mask for fun, and then took it off to protect him."
41,4,Why doesn't the president wear a mask to protect themselves?
52,4,I'd like to see our health department vote against the helmet in our county if they don't do that. But in a very general manner the public will not see them vote against the helmet if their community doesn't care.

14,4,"""They need to wear masks and get them vaccinated."""
23,4,I think this article is going to make some noise in the US and the US. Is it even the case?
41,4,"The article is completely accurate. You're a woman. It's a pretty fucking big issue, and if you want to learn about the history and laws surrounding the use of masks, you need to do the opposite."
52,4,Why not make the helmets a hoodie to prevent the spread of a viral virus?
53,4,"OP, you say the government is trying to protect your breath, and what you see is not a good idea."
60,4,"""We want to prevent the spread of the virus, I'll wear a mask in a heartbeat if you don't wear a mask... It's one of the most important measures deployed by the government"""
64,4,I'm a skeptic. That's what the wiki page is for.
65,4,"No matter what your parents do and do not think of vaccine as a vaccinating measure, the state must be accountable for their actions. This is not about the mask itself. It's about the government's intention to put their kids and grandchildren at risk."
87,4,I've never heard of wearing a mask in public. It makes me realize what isn't right for you. I'm also thinking of being more careful.
90,4,"The government is fucking using a mask, so the government is going to use it in a way that's only possible if it's really effective."
95,4,You are a man. You are a man.
100,4,My friend wears a mask on every night and she's had the same symptoms for a year and a half now. She can eat whatever he wants but she has a hard time breathing and she can't get out of it. It is a very difficult thing to do to me and I'm going through the process of just going from wearing a mask to having a hard time breathing.
101,4,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
7,4,Probably a good reason for people who think it's the best way to stop the spread of a virus.
9,4,"The only question i hear is ""is there a CDC mandate that mandates you to wear a mask?"""
14,4,I'm glad the government hasn't rolled over. There hasn't been an attack on public health in nearly a decade. /r/politics got something like this recently.
23,4,I'm very upset because this is the first time I've ever heard something like this - you don't get to 'do it' and get an actual vaccination? You can't do it. You aren't going to rehash the point you are making.
41,4,"The mask is a thing in most people's life. People who haven't seen it in public haven't been in a position to have a conversation about it, because they feel compelled to do so."
52,4,"You know what, thats not a valid reason to call your teammates ninjas, who are on the field with vaccines?"
53,4,> if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops
60,4,The people are actually being a little bit of a bullshit here.
64,4,"I think the ""Mask a Man"" meme about the flu. I'm a skeptic. That's what the wiki page is for. I'm going to go ahead and say something along the lines of ""Do you like wearing masks on my hands and putting them on?"" Isn't it just a thing of the past where a man has a reversible disease and a medical mask?"""
65,4,"So, you're defending the mask, and the schools for not putting a mask on the other students, and in the US, not wanting to provide anyone with access to the CDC?"
87,4,"I have a few friends with respiratory problems who would like to wear a mask and say, “I can’t be all that good at being honest about what I’ve been through, especially when I don’t have to make the transition to a normal person.”"
90,4,"The federal government is the ""other"" government who needs to help stop this epidemic, it's a big government problem."
95,4,"I don't think it was the right movie, but the idea was the way they had used it in this movie."
100,4,"I'm in the UK. I don't have a mask because I get cancer, but my allergies are awfully bad and it causes me to breathe. I know it does nothing to keep people alive. It's pretty much my life."
101,4,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
7,4,"That's some sort of mythical belief. It's a very common belief for many people and for the CDC. There are some very stupid people in the country, some really unmotivated."
9,4,"I don't think you can really blame you for this, it's been a while since I've tried to wear a mask."
14,4,"Well, they're not the government, and they don't have the authority to enforce any laws on them."
23,4,"Vaccination can prevent certain types of diseases, even if it's not a vaccine. The government has created policies to prevent certain types of diseases."
41,4,This is a very serious issue. You are being sarcastic.
52,4,"""I'm not sure if it's worth the effort to read the article, but I'd agree that the ACA would not be appropriate. There are several reasons to remove the mask from public health practices, like ensuring the health of the patient."
53,4,I'm assuming he meant that the national guard isn't allowed to enforce anti-virus laws?
60,4,"It's kind of an incredibly shady remark. But, I wouldn't want to risk my life because it's so obvious unless you're trying to make a joke or you're a lawyer or someone who hasn't made it out of their mind."
64,4,[Redditor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit_Opinions/Posters_Opinions_French_Flu)
65,4,The school is probably right to keep putting on masks. You can't even get a mask on your own neck while being vaccinated. That means the state doesn't have to do anything about it. The CDC is doing something to save lives in the CDC. They must be responsible for their actions.
87,4,"I'm not sure what you're talking about, but there is a joke that seems appropriate to me. A lot of people think ""the only way to get people to stop being a ""dumb guy"" is if they don't really want to, especially in a situation where they have no need for a mask. This is the joke that I'm thinking of posting, but I'm worried about this not coming up again, as there's been a lot of comments in the past about the joke."
90,4,>the government is going to use it in a way that's only possible if it's really effective.
95,4,We have the film. It has an awesome message.
100,4,Is there a way to get your health checks and test results to determine if you have HIV?
101,4,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
7,4,"I'm sorry, but I was not a physician, and I cannot speak to the CDC directly. Is it even in law?"
9,4,There are several comments like this on here where the government is helping to stop the spread of HIV. This joke isn't a joke. It is an issue for a lot of people.
14,4,"They need to protect themselves, but they don't. Isn't that an example of a ridiculous ad?"
23,4,"The president is in the wrong. The hysterectomy was a joke, and his hair was so bad that the mask made it bleed."
41,4,"I don't care about your personal safety. It is not your job to be a doctor and have a health care provider, that is for you."
52,4,I would say that wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of the virus. Please wear masks.
53,4,"CANNOTANSWER: ""The first person comments on the video are based on my knowledge of how the government is doing things in our country. What he's saying is... I don't think he can get vaccinated for HIV (because the government isn't going to fix it) I've got to say I'm glad the government has not removed the ""unfortunate"" part, because it's not going to change."
60,4,"No it is not. The actual problem is how many people wear masks, and when it happens, they die. The only one who could understand how the government is ignoring a problem that the government has to address is the president. The reason they are so incompetent is because a large percentage of the public care that they receive is due to I like to call this a ""dick masked in a suit, but I can't afford to take the same risks."" Because they aren't putting people at risk."
64,4,This is my second post about a vaccine.
65,4,"People want to know what a medical emergency is, because they're not going to be able to have access to the government."
87,4,I don't understand you.
90,4,The whole government is opportunistic about it.
95,4,I think it's probably good that you're watching the movie. You're gonna have to watch it again.
100,4,People with HIV are very often the ones who die on the basis of a mask. It's often a sign of insecurity.
101,4,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
7,4,People do not realize the truth. Those are the ones who are using it.
9,4,"The only thing I can see is ""is there a CDC mandate that mandates you to wear a mask?"", ""I don't think you can really blame you for this, it's been a while since I've tried to wear a mask."", ""I don't think you can really blame you for this, it's been a while since I've tried to wear a mask."""
14,4,It's ridiculous. This is not even a joke.
23,4,He doesn't wear a mask. He wants to make it like a joke. He's being a tyrant.
41,4,"You are being sarcastic, and i'm not even kidding."
52,4,"The ACA prohibits the use of other medicines a person may use to get AIDS. It's an anti-Semitic act which is a real thing to get passed in Congress, and is used to stop the spread of HIV."
53,4,I was in the medical field for 5 years.
60,4,... I want to go on a limb and say it in a sarcastic and witty way.
64,4,So... a reversible disease and a medical mask?
65,4,I think you're defending the CDC because it's trying to stop AIDS.
87,4,"This is my first post and I read it as ""I think it's the only way to try to get people to stop being a ""dumb guy"" because I thought it was a nice way to show them the humor. I'm really not a huge fan of the notion of wearing a mask. It's just one of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
90,4,> The whole ACA thing is ridiculous.
95,4,You must have just seen the movie before.
100,4,This is a really unhelpful misunderstanding of the problem and the way it is being treated.
101,4,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
7,4,"He threw a prank on the president, not the CIA."
9,4,This movie is a great way to put it. It's very well written and the author is a remarkably decent guy.
14,4,">He is going to ask the other guy this: Why do people keep wearing a mask in their car and out of public places?

23,4,That's a very good one.
41,4,"Yes, it is a prank."
52,4,"The thing with the ACA is that the government uses anti-semitism to help people to be more virtuous, so that the people who want to help are not able to be virtuous."
53,4,I'm not sure if this is a real problem here but it's not an issue that the NSA doesn't have a legitimate interest in preventing.
60,4,So what did the ACA say about the US? I've only seen that one.
64,4,There aren't many Americans on the Internet who do not believe that medical masks were invented by the people to stop people from using them. I am a lawyer and we know this.
65,4,In the future the people would have to take responsibility for their own actions.
87,4,"When I was a kid I was all about that ""I just want to tell you the truth and not make them feel bad."" So I decided to try the phrase ""I'm not sure what you're talking about, but there is a joke that seems appropriate to me."
90,4,i can only say this because i read this movie once. it is very similar to wtf the movie is about. it is very funny but the govt doesn't actually follow the government's reluctance to follow the federal govt evidencia ad not to pass the ACA.
95,4,"I was at the theater for a movie, and the guy from the movie said, ""There's no point in being a guy without a mask, and all of the guys who wear masks are going to get sick."" I was in the theater in the movie, so I watched it."
100,4,"What do you mean by ""I am just trying to understand why this isn't the main issue with people with AIDS""?"
101,4,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
7,4,Wearing a mask helps in stopping the spread of a virus. The joke is still hilarious.
9,4,>This movie has become more relevant in recent months and will become more and more relevant in the future.
14,4,>I'm glad the government hasn't rolled over. There hasn't been an attack on public health in nearly a decade.
23,4,My doctor has a different opinion on the disease than you.
41,4,You're using a pretty good joke. That's a prank.
52,4,I'm not anti-smoking and I am not anti-VIDEO.
53,4,">I'm glad the government has not removed the ""unfortunate"" part, because it's not going to change.',"
60,4,"aww, you mean like wearing a mask."
64,4,I would say this is one of the few logical responses to this.
65,4,"Despite this, I don't think this is ""a joke,"" it's a prank."
87,4,That is a weird and insensitive line to make. The word mask is used by a lot of people in a sense.
90,4,"They did the mask to 'help' stop a virus on the government's hands, and apparently they were the ones that wiped out people in their own homes. It's a good idea to be aware of that, but you are putting a lot of pressure on your government to put it on the people in your house and protect them."
95,4,That's the snarky part.
100,4,"People with AIDS can't be cured if they're wearing a mask, so there is no way to really get help with it. It's been 5 years now and a lot of people are wearing masks, so its very important to understand. The most important thing to remember is to have the ability to recognize that some people are not immune."
101,4,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
7,4,I don't think the CDC has any information or resources to do anything about it.
9,4,"The CDC is telling the whole truth, it is about trying to get people to wear masks, and that it's not a joke that they will do their part to stop the spread of the virus."
14,4,'What is a prank?' is the one where the president was asked why this guy was not in a mask.
23,4,"The president is in the wrong. The hysterectomy was a joke, and his hair was so bad that the mask made it bleed."
41,4,I don't know if this is all a prank. It's not a joke. It's an excuse for the health care industry to be censored.
52,4,"I'm not anti-smoking and I am not anti-VIDEO. The fact that the ACA is the best way to stop the spread of HIV, is absolutely incredible."
53,4,"'The first person comments on the video are based on my knowledge of how the government is doing things in our country. What he means is... I don't think he can get vaccinated for HIV (because the government isn't going to fix it) I'm glad the government has not removed the ""unfortunate"" part, because it's not going to change.',"
60,4,"I've gotta say the most important part of the whole ACA is that if it's not the government's job to prevent people from getting vaccinated, it's the government's job to prevent it from being a big deal."
64,4,"So, I'm guessing that the doctor that tried to tell her to go get a vaccination tries to convince her that there is no reason to get a vaccine? ''If there is a chance he can get that? ''"
65,4,"The question is whether people can be given a good mask for a health care emergency, but if they can't afford it, they shouldn't wear it."
87,4,"I've seen a lot of people wear masks. I know that the people that say that they're not safe from the virus will not necessarily be able to do that. They may be just incompetent people, but it's not like they should do it. The only reason I think it's funny is because people who wear a mask are being exploited. It's just a good thing that the government has some sort of program called Hyperprotective Mask that doesn't allow people to wear a mask to prevent the spread of a virus."
90,4,> I can only say this because i read this movie once. it is very similar to wtf the movie is about.
95,4,I don't think this is as good of a movie as the book. I just don't see why people are so worried about downvotes.
100,4,I'm talking about the stigma attached to the AIDS.
101,4,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
7,4,"You're right, it's a big problem."
9,4,Vaccinating and keeping people safe is a big red flag in the USA.
14,4,What is a joke? You don't like a prank. You don't like a prank.
23,4,"I am not the president, but I don't care if you eat or drink anything. It is just not acceptable and has no place in American culture. The president is against health insurance and health care. I think that the only way to prevent it is to do it at the health clinic that is willing to pay for it. The mask is a good way to prevent the spread of a virus."
41,4,I think this is a great way to make your point.
52,4,He is a bit of a shit. They're a lot more effective with health and safety issues. He just sounds a little weird about it.
53,4,>Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
60,4,"I think you are missing a crucial part. It was a joke, but that is not what the movie is about. It's based on some research by the authors."
64,4,It's not a good movie. It's not a good movie. It's a good film.
65,4,"I think the question is whether people can be given a good mask for a health care emergency, but if they can't afford it, they shouldn't wear it. The answer is: I don't think the issue is a joke."
87,4,It's very likely that when you get a virus you can't stop it.
90,4,"I've seen the movie, it's about a virus, and a man being shot, but it's about how government is using it to make this very serious epidemic that's on everyone's hands. It's so cynical and self-righteous it is a good film."

52,4,"I was in Georgia for college, and I don't think the health officials who are running for office would even think about putting the mask on because the President voted against the order. The only way that I know of is that some schools are using the mask on all their coaches. I think it's great that the Obama administration is working to make everyone feel safer."

60,4,I think the problem with this movie is that we should be able to vote for the president for the first time.
64,4,"I agree, the ACA is the best idea."
65,4,A lot of things are being misunderstood here.
87,4,"I feel like this is a joke. I have been in a lot of movies and it seems like a lot of people have been talking about a joke in a manner that can't be easily removed. I don't know the facts and I'm not sure I understand them because it doesn't sound like a joke. It seems like it's a joke. It's not a joke, it's a joke."
90,4,"In the movie, the guy is in the doctor's office with a mask on. I don't want a mask on someone who has HIV, I want a mask on someone who has HIV. Why is it a satire? Because the whole government is opportunistic about it."

100,4,">He’s wearing a mask, because he feels like a dick AIDS is not the disease - it is the disease which causing the spread of the disease - it's the stigma attached to it. It takes a lot of sex to be healthy, and her genitals aren't healthy, yet. I think the best way to end a relationship with him is to get a doctor to tell him that he needs a mask."
101,4,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
7,4,Is there anything you want to be able to do?
9,4,"What the hell is a joke? Those are the words that came up in this thread, but if there's a joke, it's a joke, and a joke, and the fact that there's a joke."

60,4,The actual problem with this movie is that we should be able to vote for the president for the first time.

7,4,"I don't think I've seen any of these. But I do know that the ACA is a joke, but a lot of people aren't really aware of it. This movie is about a doctor trying to prevent HIV infection. The problem with a mask is that people don't know how to walk because they think it's bad. Putting on a mask doesn't make it a joke, and it will never be an issue.

53,4,CANNOTANSWER: The only person you have to talk to about this topic is yourself.
60,4,What he said is a prank. A prank or a joke? The answer is that the people are being a little bit jacked up.
64,4,This meme has everything to do with the ACA.
65,4,There's no denying that these things are being misunderstood and that they are a joke.
87,4,Isn't this what people think is the joke?
90,4,the ACA is ridiculous and the tyranny is hilariously bad. It's a really good example of how the government treats the health care system. The movie is a really good example of how the Obama administration has dealt with the health care system.
95,4,A lot of people don't like what they see as satire. That's just what I know of snark.
100,4,"There's no way to tell if it's a symptom of AIDS. It is a very complex disease. There is a virus in the lungs that causes you to eat the food you eat?

90,4,The whole ACA thing is ridiculous. It's ridiculous and tyranny is hilariously bad. It's a really good example of how the government treats the healthcare system.
95,4,I'm a man and I enjoy all the ideas you described. I like a lot of things but I don't like what they see as satire.
100,4,"The stigma is still there. There isn't enough information to prove that his mother has AIDS and that it has no symptom. In fact it's very hard to treat with a mask. People who have a mask and have a mask can't actually treat it without a mask, but they cannot prevent HIV/ AIDS."
101,4,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
7,4,Getting vaccinated with a mask is the best way to fight this terrible AIDS.

23,4,A sexist joke is something that can't be joked or fixed. :-(
41,4,"So, it was a prank. CANNOTANSWER:"
52,4,The joke was thrown around as a joke and the article was about the president being a troll.
53,4,"""We wear masks to fight the flu. I don't care who the title is, I think you know the issue."""
60,4,"Those people are clearly being jacked up. I think people should take an honest look at how the ACA does not address the issue - how can a politician be willing to work for this? How can a politician say things like, ""That's funny and I'm afraid I'm not the president"". We should also have the President be willing to spend some time listening to the people in the theater - if they don't do their job, they should just keep their mouth shut and listen to their own personal feelings."
64,4,As a lawyer I would say I would say this is one of the few logical responses to this.
65,4,They're being a joke.

95,4,I like to do my research and watch the movie. It's kind of weird and you can't understand it.
100,4,It doesn't change the fact that there's no way to tell if it's the disease.
101,4,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
7,4,It's still a joke.
9,4,I don't understand why people are making fun of the facts but you're not blaming the president.
14,4,"I don't think anyone's going to think that this is a joke. There is just too much information to keep the word 'common sense' around, and as the author's explanation suggests, this isn't a joke."
23,4,The guy is a troll. And I am very upset that this is the first time I've heard something like this - you don't get to 'do it' and get an actual vaccine? You can't do it. You aren't going to rehash the point you are making.
41,4,"I didn't understand this until now. The mask thing has been really naive for the past few months. You know what? It makes you think it's funny, but the guy who made the joke is a prank, not a joke. He doesn't even have to explain why it was a prank."
52,4,">The fact that the ACA is the best way to stop the spread of HIV, is absolutely incredible."""
53,4,The whole thing is really ridiculous. The nsa is a government corporation. They are only promoting the disease and are trying to stop the spread of AIDS.
60,4,"I'm just reading the whole thing, and it is a good point."
64,4,You know what? The Obama Effect is the shit he has written about the US government. Why does that matter?
65,4,Vaccination isn't the issue. It's the problem.
87,4,"I like this because you put in a lot of effort to make it sound like a joke, and don't put in the effort to make a joke that doesn't make you uncomfortable."
90,4,"The article says: ""(I read this article](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_a_em_ecni?v=emn_ee) is a video satire. The problem is the mask itself. It is a tool of government, which will provide many advantages to the people in your life to prevent them from becoming infected with HIV/AIDS. So it will not only cause people to become infected but also prevent other diseases from getting infected with HIV/AIDS."
95,4,"A prankster's character will prank on you and you won't get sick, that's all."
100,4,"I'm trying to help, but this guy isn't doing anything to improve his life. This is not a good thing for him, he's a jerk, he's being disrespectful, and this is not fair. And what he does is wrong. He should have been treated in a more positive light because it's a very important thing."
101,4,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
7,4,"I want to say that I don't think a lot of people are joking. It is a joke because the CDC, and the President, are both narcissists who wish to spread the ACA. But a joke that is a joke, is still funny."
9,4,">I can't understand why people are trying to laugh at these jokes and find the jokes funny. They are satire. I just can't understand them. I can understand how someone is able to make up the jokes. There's a movie called 'Pilot in Prisoner' that has a really great story about people who don't have masks, and how the joke makes people uncomfortable."
14,4,"You've got a new, more pertinent question: who is wearing the mask?"
23,4,I'm not saying that this is a prank.
41,4,AIDS is not a joke
52,4,Obamacare is a nonsense thing.
53,4,>the problem is the people in the U.S. who don't wear a mask. The whole thing is really ridiculous. The nsa is a government corporation. They are only promoting the disease and are trying to stop the spread of AIDS. Is there a problem with the government's work or is it a political issue?
60,4,People are going to take this as an example of the ACA because it's not effective.
64,4,"Having an infectious illness isn't going to help anybody, it's going to affect the whole world."
65,4,"The CDC was doing a great job preventing people from getting vaccinated, but there's no way that they could do that, because there's no way the government would pay for someone who would be infected with the virus."
87,4,"Isn't this about a joke? I'm not a joke and you said you don't get it, but I can see it. It is a joke and I would like to see it."
90,4,"The whole government is trying to repress it, they're being really nasty at it, if the ad isn't actually working it doesn't really work"

14,4,"The CDC doesn't seem to want to do anything about it, but apparently it hasn't been successful. Vaccines and AIDS have always been popular amongst women in America, if a woman was vaccinated for a virus. It was not until recently that there was a real problem with the spread of AIDS that the first person to try wearing a mask was in a hospital."
23,4,"I'm not going to make a joke about ACA. It's the health care issue, and this has nothing to do with ACA. It's a joke. But it isn't a joke. It's a joke."
41,4,CANNOTANSWER: 'Masked people can wear a mask.' (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masked_people_Cannot) The problem is that the ACA would not address the issue of who is allowed in public space or who is protected by the law.
52,4,What is a joke? Isn't that exactly what Obamacare is for?
53,4,OP is just a good fucking reporter - this is just another bit of nonsense.
60,4,"""Says I'm not the president"", says ""The guy is a prankster. I don't know what you want to do."
64,4,ACA isn't a prank but the best way to stop it is to make people feel uncomfortable with the ACA.
65,4,"If the CDC really wants to stop the spread of AIDS and then go through this shit, why don't you just go get some help and try to find a new job and go to a CDC?"
87,4,"I had a friend with asthma. He and his sister were wearing a mask on the day before their first day of work. It was the best thing he could do, I think. I thought it would be fun to talk about his asthma. He would also be joking about the way he did it a couple times and then they started to put on a mask."
90,4,"Nope, it’s just a satire aimed at someone else who is already sick of the ACA."
95,4,I've seen a lot of funny pranks. I like the movie.

I think he's trying to get rid of the ACA, which has nothing to do with sexism."
64,4,CANNOTANSWER: the ACA is the biggest political challenge in history and is the biggest failure in the last 30 years. The whole thing is a prank.
65,4,"This makes me think of the ACA as a joke, which means no CDC involvement with the public health and public health programs."
87,4,>the only reason I think it's funny is because people who wear a mask are being exploited. It's just a good thing that the government has some sort of program called Hyperprotective Mask that doesn't allow people to wear a mask to prevent the spread of a virus.

64,4,I think that the people who want a good movie about the Obama Effect are the ones who will not be getting the benefit of it because it's a prank.

90,4,You should see this movie: “The problem is a mask” is a really good example of how the government treats the health system.
95,4,"Some people are really not into pranks. The movie, which is about a guy doing a prank and not getting sick, that's all."
100,4,"I'm in the US, where HIV/AIDS is a severe illness, so there is not much that you can say to me that it's not a mental illness, it's an infectious disease. HIV/AIDs is a mental illness, so it's not really that uncommon for people to have it, but it's rare enough that it has some degree of effect."
101,4,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
7,4,I'm gonna give you some more. I don't want to be a prankster. I want to be a prankster.
9,4,Vaccination and keeping people safe is a big red flag in the USA.
14,4,"'I don't know how you understand putting on a mask is a joke. I don't know how you understand putting on a mask is a joke. If someone wants to help, a mask will not help. If they want to protect themselves, they have to wear a mask. I don't think it's funny, but it's a joke. It's funny, but it's not a joke. It's a joke. The joke, it's a joke."
23,4,"> I'm pretty sure the entire point is that the ACA is a joke,"
41,4,I think it's because I don't want to be a doctor and I don't want to be in the position to get AIDS.
52,4,"CANNOTANSWER is describing a piece of information from the ACA that has been made public by the state. I don't think the ACA is an ad hominem prank. It is a joke. It is a prank, but it does not change the health care system."
53,4,There are people who don't think it's a prank because they don't wear it. That's the point.
60,4,">""The only one who could understand how the government is ignoring a problem that the government has to address is the president. The reason they are so incompetent is because a large percentage of the public care that they receive is due to """"We want to prevent the spread of the virus, I'll wear a mask in a heartbeat if you don't wear a mask... and why he has no job to keep them safe."""""
64,4,"It's the only way to prevent HIV, and it doesn't even count in the first place. The whole reason the vaccines were invented is because they aren't really used by the government, and aren't considered effective for preventing HIV."
65,4,"I think the whole thing is sexist and inappropriate. The ACA isn't an ACA, it's a joke."
87,4,"A friend of mine that wore a mask had a lung infection and had a stroke after that. She never had this problem. She ended up getting the disease, but she didn't realize she had it and wasn't able to see it. She sat her dog on the bed when she did the fapping and awoke. It was a funny joke, and she got a head cold and she was wearing a mask, and she told the truth."
90,4,I had a huge misunderstanding.
95,4,"The movie and movie is not a prank, it's a prank about a prankster."
100,4,">''We're having a hard time breathing for a couple of years. I'm going through the process of just going from wearing a mask to having a hard time breathing.

It's pretty much my life.""'', ""My friend wears a mask every night and she's had the same symptoms for a couple of years."
101,4,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
7,4,The only way I've ever heard a joke that could have been the joke was when I told you it was a joke.
9,4,It is not a joke. It is a joke that is being used to try to stop the spread of AIDS. It is an issue that is relevant to every person imaginable.
14,4,"I can only imagine the sarcasm and reaction in this thread, especially when the president is giving his version of the story to the people and saying, ""It's a joke, it's a joke, it's a joke."""
23,4,"CANNOTANSWER: In my opinion, the joke is a joke, but it doesn't make a point."
41,4,“I think it’s a joke. A prank is an excuse to put on a mask and the president has to be able to go outside without it.”
52,4,So if you are interested in reading the story and see what was said here. What we see here is a joke. The idea of a mask is an easy joke to understand and would help the people affected. The ACA is the only way to be safe and stop the spread of AIDS.
53,4,I think there is a lot of untrue information here about the Obama administration's actions.
60,4,"CANNOTANSWER : I see your point here, but I think people should take an honest look at how the ACA does not address the issue. The Obama administration has been doing this with the intent of removing the Affordable Care Act."
64,4,The word Obama ahd is just a generic reference to the ACA which is a prank. It's a joke.
65,4,"> I am not interested in the comments, but I can help you figure out if you'd like me to post more comments on this."
87,4,So what does the joke about a mask have to do with the word 'dumb'?
90,4,That's a great example of how the government treats the health care system.
95,4,"I think the movie is pretty good, but it isn't a prank, and it's not based off of the book."
100,4,"HIV is an infectious disease that affects the entire world. It's not a mental illness, but a mental illness."

9,4,"CANNOTANSWER: ""Some people are 'haha' because they don't have them, so they try to troll them to get some fucking laugh."""
14,4,I just wanted to say I don't really get why people think that this is a joke
23,4,"It sounds like the article is going to be an interesting read. It doesn't make the point ""The ACA is a joke because it was a joke"" but it is a joke that the CDC is trying to make a point that it isn't a joke. It is a joke that it is supposed to make people more aware of the ACA."
41,4,I don't think I'm being sarcastic. That's the point of the article.

60,4,"[NAME] says that a ""dick masked in a suit, but I can't afford to take the same risks."""
64,4,A lot of people believe the Obama Effect is a joke because it explains the issue and makes the president think the ACA was a prank. The whole reason the ACA was a prank.
65,4,What makes this joke even funny?
87,4,"I think that's a great joke and you should read it. It's kind of like that you just say ""I think it's funny that people who wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus are being exploited."
90,4,The quote on the page is not about the ACA.
95,4,'Sometimes a movie is more prank than a book. Sometime a joke comes off as a joke.''

101,4,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
7,4,It's not a joke. It's a prank.
9,4,There's a lot of shady things going on in America. There's not going to be a joke if the President did something to stop the spread of the virus. The CDC is not in the CDC's best interest to prevent and stop the spread of AIDS. Vaccines aren't mandatory by law in the USA.
14,4,A lot of people don't know what a joke is.
23,4,"""...why are you being downvoted to hell based on your comment? I'm pretty sure the entire point is that the ACA is a joke"

52,4,I would tell my dad to change a lot of things about Obamacare.
53,4,They're just promoting the disease and trying to stop the spread of AIDS. They're only promoting the disease and trying to stop the spread of AIDS.
60,4,The question is why would they have a sexist joke?
64,4,CANNOTANSWER is an anti-immigration activist. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of a virus.
65,4,"I can't believe it, but the word joke is an inappropriate word. There is a slur in this article."
87,4,"They might not have a lot of good intentions, but they are in the right and they should have been trying to get people to put on a mask."
90,4,So the government doesn't get to repress a health care issue?
95,4,"...and in the sequel, he's basically saying that ""The movie isn't as good as the book....but I do think that the movie isn't quite the prank that everyone is talking about."""
100,4,AIDS is not a mental illness. HIV/AIDS is an infectious disease. It is not an infectious disease. It is not an infectious disease. It is not an infectious disease. It is not an infectious disease. It is not an infectious disease. It is not an infectious disease. It is not an infectious disease. It is not an infectious disease. It is not an infectious disease.

23,4,I've heard the article isn't about the president. It's about a prank that is meant to be aimed at the general public.
41,4,I don't think there is a right answer here. But the joke is a joke. A prank is a joke.
52,4,>Isn't that exactly what Obamacare is for?
53,4,Is a person like him who is more than happy to be in the NSA. Or maybe the CIA?
60,4,"CANNOTANSWER: ""Don't you want to be a prankster?"""
64,4,"It sounds like you've been talking about a joke, a prank about a prank."
65,4,CANNOTANSWER says it's part of the legislation that stops people getting vaccinated
87,4,A movie is not about how you should wear a mask.
90,4,"This has been answered by three people here. One of the first people is the one that wrote the article. It's about a prank about a guy with HIV, and another about how the government is not allowed to do a mask. It's a prank. People are not allowed to do a mask and are blaming the government. They're blaming the people who are not allowed to do it.''"
95,4,I think this is just a prank.
100,4,"HIV is an infectious disease, so that would be a symptom of all the things mentioned in this article, that are not a mental illness. If you're stifling people, you're not going to end a healthy relationship with him."
101,4,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
7,4,I'm very confused about a joke about a doctor threw a prank on a CIA guy. Does he get it because it is a joke? Why do you think it's funny? Because I don't really see it as a joke. This is a joke about the idea that the CDC is trying to fight AIDS. It's a joke.
9,4,"No, you can't just read a lot of things. And even then, people seem to think you're making a joke about the president. But that's not the way to go."
14,4,"""A lot of people don't know what a joke is."", """"I just wanted to say I don't think it's funny, but it's not a joke."""
23,4,I think the article is being misinterpreted.
41,4,That jokes and jokes can be a bit snobby.
52,4,i'm a lawyer and im a lawyer and i have nothing to do with the ACA. but i just dont care enough to read it because there's a huge amount of research in there on the ACA.

87,4,"When I was little, I was not able to take a big chance because I was always wearing a mask because I thought it would make a nice joke for the people around me. When my friends told me that the one time I would come home with a sleeve of virus, a doctor wouldn't even let them, I could still go outside and talk about a cold that wasn't really my thing, and my friend was wearing a mask. When I came home with a cough and a sleeve, I had no idea that the s"
90,4,It sounds like it's a prank.
95,4,oh. my god. i love that movie. i am so hive mind that the person i am pranking on the movie is naive to not just enjoy it.
100,4,AIDS is not considered an infectious disease. HIV is an infectious disease. It is not an infectious disease.
101,4,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
7,4,People who are not a medical professional that are ill will never be a doctor and would be a bad doctor when there's no need for a medical professional to help.
9,4,A lot of people in this sub haven't gotten to know the truth of the ACA and the CDC's handling of this. It seems that this movie was made by someone who knew the CDC was doing a job to stop AIDS and he knew it. He didn't know what a prank was.
14,4,It is a joke. 'It's funny'?
23,4,I'm still trying to understand what's going on.

53,4,"I don’t think the entire ACA was a joke, I don’t think that the ACA was an anti-vaccine law."
60,4,That is the problem here. Vaccines are an important measure.
64,4,CANNOTANSWER: This is my second post about a vaccine.
65,4,"They are going to use the word ""Jocke"" in a few comments."
87,4,"I think it's hilarious when they say 'to make people happy and make them uncomfortable'. I've never seen anyone in the world implying they're joking or not thinking about the meaning of the word ""joke"" because I don't know how many words they can get across with a single one."
90,4,"I think they're making fun of the US and want to play some role in what makes them feel like a prankster. The ACA isn't a prank, but it is a good example of how the US government has handled the healthcare system."
95,4,"OP, this subreddit has a lot of pranks."
100,4,The fact that it is actually an infection is undoubtedly a problem with the use of a mask to get rid of it. I doubt that he's a good friend in the first place.
101,4,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
7,4,You know the ACA's use of the word 'joke' to refer to this kind of thing?
9,4,The whole idea of wearing a mask isn't a good idea. It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
14,4,"In the world of jokes, the CDC will be rolled over because the ACA is being implemented by the government."

65,4,I'd say this is an example of an unrelated comment here.
87,4,"Because this is a real joke. It's about what is a joke, not about how it is funny."
90,4,That's the best example of the US government treating the healthcare system.
95,4,It's a prank in the sense that they're not telling the story and the people who do the prank can't just ignore it and make a bad joke.

14,4,">I think it's funny, but it's not a joke."
23,4,So I would say that you should think more about the ACA rather than the ACA.
41,4,"This is one of those things that everyone seems to be using as an excuse to say, ""I don't like the ACA but I want to know what he's trying to say."""
52,4,"The problem is, I believe the president is a troll. I don't see what the government is doing. And yet he is a troll. The president is a troll."
53,4,I have a confession. I can't make jokes about the government. I don't think that's the point of this thread.
60,4,The ACA is the solution to the AIDS epidemic.
64,4,The White House is trying to put the ACA on all the people and is trying to make sure that people don't actually get HIV/AIDS.
65,4,"Yes, it is a joke, and the way he makes jokes is that the ACA isn't a joke. If it was a joke, he would be a joke. The joke would be that ""People want to know what a medical emergency is, because they're not going to be able to have access to the government."""
87,4,This joke is a joke in terms of humor.

14,4,It's a prank. This joke is not a joke. This is a prank. It's a prank. It's a joke. The CDC isn't going to repeal it until after the ACA is passed because of the deafness of the deaf.
23,4,"Because of your lack of attention to your point, I have no problem with if he is trying to put in a joke on you.
