79,57,What’s the difference between wearing a mask and a mask that gets worn when the government tries to help stop the spread of a virus?
86,57,Go to the store and ask if you want a gift.
92,57,We have two censorship measures:
101,57,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
57,28,... And I want to know who will wear what - what - is the best way to stop the spread of a virus
57,35,"I have to be honest. I know that you would be a little worried about the people who get sick from wearing masks. I'm not saying that a mask is good, but that a mask can be good."
57,47,Why aren't you wearing a mask outside or in your car alone your gullible and submissive not traits you want to project?
60,57,"I don't know why it's a big deal. A mask isn't actually necessary to stop the spread of a virus, just to stop a healthy person from taking sick patients or dying, but it's also an easy way to prevent people from getting sick from the virus and preventing people from getting sick, too. Until the government makes a rash like that then a mask isn't required."
68,57,I'm a law school teacher. I don't get it. The question is why do you have to wear a mask in the workplace? Do you just do it when you're not in the office? I don't see how that could be true in the obscene amount of work you do in the workplace.
74,57,Why not use a mask with the same type of mask?
79,57,You said a lot about politics here.
86,57,"If you haven't already, then don't go to the grocery store or the supermarket."
92,57,You are actually referencing a recent video showing a man with a face mask.
101,57,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
57,28,"I don't think that you were arguing that there is not a problem with having a mask on. I do believe you are simply pointing out that people are being ignorant, ie, not that we are the only ones who are doing that. I don't really think that you can find a way to talk about things that are not about politics."
57,35,I would say I wear a mask while working in a sick place and have never been able to get sick. :(
57,47,"The problem with wearing a mask is that it's inappropriate. I've had to work at work for a long time, and there's been some nasty weather conditions that I've been exposed to, but if I did, I would never wear it outside of the office. The people I worked at were so bad that it was pretty hard to get them sick. I don't like wearing a mask outside of the office."
60,57,I’m a doctor and I wear a mask all the time. The whole medical aspect of it is pretty much the same.
68,57,"Aside from what you said, a person has to be in the best shape to be able to make the job safer and prevent accidents. You don't have to be in the best shape to be able to make the job safer."
74,57,You might want to check your medical records. I don't see any evidence of them spreading it on the internet. Why not use a mask with the same type of mask?
79,57,he isn't a killer
86,57,"That's called the ""Made in America"" rule and it's used to stop the spread of a virus."
92,57,The biggest problem I have with censorship in Australia is the health care and access to medical care. In the US there is no system to stop the spread of diseases so he can't take care of it.
101,57,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
57,28,I'm sure you'll get your points across. You were simply pointing out that that is what we're talking about. What I'm saying is that the best way to stop the spread of the virus is to prevent people from getting sick from wearing masks.
57,35,"It’s also not a big deal, and if you want to get sick it’s better not to wear a mask outside of work."
57,47,"I'm not a lawyer, I'm a doctor and I wear a mask all the time. The whole medical aspect of it is pretty much the same."
60,57,"This is the OP's story. I don't know why he's being upset by it but I do know the school did not like it. It's really just because the schools are doing it in a different way. If you were a student and have a mask on your hands, but no other mask on your hands, you would probably just want to sit through the whole thing."
68,57,I don't think there's anything else that would be sarcastic in this sub.
74,57,"So, why do you need a mask? You don't, in this case, need a mask that prevents the spread of a virus."
79,57,No one likes Trump so that's why they don't wear his mask when he's in public. I think it's funny how the president didn't want to be shot.
86,57,">Why don't you wear my mask if it is a health problem? The most important thing to do is to take care of your health, not your health."
92,57,"I feel like I need to move to the US, and I don't think we need to change this."
101,57,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
57,28,"This is not about whether or not a guy is a doctor or a doctor. It's about whether or not the people who wear the mask should be given the chance to tell you that the best way to stop the spread of a virus is to wear a mask that 'protects' against a person's health, and not their ability to tell their employer that they can wear a mask because of health issues."
57,35,"He was being sarcastic. I can't say that I want to wear a mask outside of work, but I would say I wear a mask outside of work. I don't know why."
57,47,"This was not the case in Australia, unless it was a school law violation that was the subject of some sort of medical policy."
60,57,Vaccines are NOT a prank.
68,57,"I’ve also been told to avoid making my face feel blood, because when I wear a mask I feel it being pulled into my face."
74,57,I'm glad he didn't just take a rat bite because of it.
79,57,>How do you think a guy can be as good as a woman?
86,57,That's not a rule of thumb. A rule that protects against a dangerous infection. A rule of thumb that protects against a disease.
92,57,There's a big difference between people with a mask and people without. I live in the US. I think it's not really an issue with the censorship but rather the fact that most people in a similar position aren't using it in any way.
101,57,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
57,28,The best way to stop the spread of a virus is to prevent people from getting sick from wearing masks.
57,35,"I was at the hospital with a virus that was going to spread to people, and it was very obvious that the doctor wasn't wearing a mask and it was a problem with a virus."
57,47,"In the US, yes, they want people with a mask to have some kind of health insurance. The only difference is they want to be protected from getting sick."
60,57,"Nope, this is the shady part."
68,57,"Is there a real reason you don't wear a mask? If you don't, then you don't get to put on a mask, because the way you put on a mask could lead to a virus."
74,57,I would fuck that up.
79,57,>No one likes Trump so that's why they don't wear his mask when he's in public. I think it's funny how the president didn't want to be shot.
86,57,What is the rule to wear a mask when you have a virus?
92,57,A great point is that some things have an unrelated effect on the health and safety of some people. So it's not a big deal.
101,57,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
57,28,I don't understand you being able to relate to it in a way that would sound like an issue with this.
57,35,"The government in the U.S. is not really a democracy. The president of the US is not a democratically elected leader. If the President of the US was elected, he would be a democratically elected president."
57,47,"Vaccines are NOT a prank. I’ve also been told to avoid making my face feel blood, because when I wear a mask I feel it being pulled into my face. I would fuck that up."
60,57,I feel that it's not fair for the health care industry to take on the role of an individual by refusing to put on a medical mask on their hands. They're not going to take the responsibility of what they want out of their resentment or interest in making a joke about someone who had a virus.
68,57,We can't have a dictator without the government and a president.
74,57,I think the government needs to get to the bottom of it.
79,57,>I've seen a lot of it on social media and it is amazing. It's not funny. It's a joke.
86,57,"""Hey, there is no putting on a mask when I have a virus!"""
92,57,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
101,57,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
57,28,People in other countries will wear masks and it's a big deal.
57,35,"I am not an advocate of government, but he should probably do this if he wants to be a dictator."
57,47,"Vaccines are not a prank, if you haven't had one, then that is your best shot at going on an illness threatening to spread into the world. Vaccines are not a prank, but it is an important part of the policy. There's a difference in how they can protect against an infection."
60,57,I would be upset if they didn't do this. I would be able to get away with it.
68,57,The only thing that stops them is them calling a troll to the NSA and telling him to wear a mask in front of the reporter and getting vaccinated.
74,57,"This is not a joke, it's a joke. The hat is just a joke, the hat is the virus. It's not funny, but i like how he is a very outspoken person who does that. He's a fucking moron. What a joke. The hat is just a joke, the hat is the virus."
79,57,"I like how he's saying this, but I don't think he's telling the joke about wearing a mask to stop the spread of a virus."
86,57,"It's an example of a lack of proper protection. ""It sounds like a simple rule of thumb for a lot of people to follow: Putting on a mask to prevent the spread of a virus. It sounds like that guy's attitude has changed since then."
92,57,"The US has a bad health care system. It makes me wonder what the cost of a mask is in relation to being an active member of society. The US can be so big that you're really surprised they're such a big deal, considering how big the health care cost is."
101,57,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
57,28,Vaccines and the people who wear them will be told by the government that they are the best way to stop the spread of the virus.
57,35,"I don't think the guy is taking the blame, but I'd like him to do what he wants."
57,47,"""We're not gonna take on the role of an individual by refusing to put on a medical mask outside of the office. I'm not going to take on the responsibility of what they want out of their resentment or interest in making a joke about someone who had a virus."""
60,57,This isn't a joke. This is a movie.
68,57,> I have a few friends who wear masks because they are so painful and they don't get to do that. Probably the biggest slam dunk to the US economy to keep this incredibly unhealthy.
74,57,"It's funny, but funny because I love it."
79,57,>We can help a virus but it’s not funny. It's a joke.
86,57,That's an awfully big lie.
92,57,"A lot of the censorship measures were implemented in Australia, I'm surprised there's a large population in Australia."
101,57,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
57,28,I want to know who will wear what. You don't want to get into my way?
57,35,"""I wear a mask while working in a sick place and have never been able to get sick. :(', ""I would say I wear a mask while working in a sick place and have never been able to get sick. :(', ""I would say I wear a mask outside of work. I don’t know why."""""
57,47,They're also being forced to wear their face masks to keep 'normal' work hours at a higher pace and to avoid putting on some clothing causing a lot of injury to their health. That's kind of a joke.
60,57,"Vaccines are NOT a prank. A CDC mandates a ""no contact"" with your head."
68,57,"It's kind of silly to talk about how the government is doing what's necessary to prevent the spread of the virus. It's not even a joke, and it's kind of ridiculous."
74,57,A lot of people would like to find the movie. A lot of people would be more excited to find it. I don't think it's a joke. I think it's just a hammer.
79,57,Why are we not talking about the NSA?
86,57,"The reason I don't have a mask is because I'm a guy, and I don't even know what the real troll is."
92,57,":) I don't think the US is a troll because it is not going to change the healthcare system. The US is not a troll because it is not going to change the healthcare system. Its not just the government, but also the healthcare system itself."
101,57,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
57,28,I don't think the people who wear masks are stupid or stupid. They don't look like the normal people who wear them.
57,35,Vaccines and the people who wear them will be told by the government that they are the best way to stop the spread of the virus.
57,47,"I do not know why you're downvoted, but if I were to come across something like this again, I'd say that's a joke."
60,57,"This is a joke, not a prank. This is a movie about the CDC."
68,57,"If the CDC actually wants to help the government to prevent AIDS, they should use it. It's an excuse for not getting vaccines. I'm assuming the CDC would be willing to give the federal government access to vaccines."
74,57,That's very much the point of the movie - this isn't just about the president - it's about the people who are affected by the virus.
79,57,r/relationships.
86,57,I have a lot of friends who don't get the joke. One guy in a party is shit at best. His adage is: 'you have to be an expert on the anti-virus thing.' I don't know what the real troll is.
92,57,What's the deal with the tyrant?
101,57,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
57,28,I don't get why you think that they were doing that and that they weren't just pointing out that the only people who are doing that are not on the same page as you. They're telling you that it is important to wear a mask outside. They don't even know what a troll is.
57,35,"Vaccines are a joke. The government is a troll, not a prank."
57,47,"I want to see the movie ""Non Contact"" - the film about the president vs. Obama"
60,57,"There's no ""respect"" for the CDC. They are just doing it to keep the school from putting their shit together."
68,57,"They want to prevent the spread of AIDS and I think the best way to get that stopped is by putting a mask on you. If you wear a mask in public, you get a warning warning."
74,57,"Then it's not funny. Then it's a satire of a book containing all of the same bits and pieces, or it's a satire of a book based on an alleged plotline."
79,57,I have been in this sub. You have my condolences. You’re being very rude.
86,57,The point is that a lot of people don't get the joke despite being told a lot of things about the president.
92,57,Is it any consolation that the tyrant is an American or something?
101,57,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
57,28,Because you're a troll.
57,35,"Vaccines are a joke. The government is a troll, not a prank."
57,47,"""Way to go to work for a long time. There's been some nasty weather conditions that I've been exposed to, but if I did, I would never wear it outside of the office."""
60,57,Isn't that one of those ridiculous remark that I can't even read? Because there is a whole lot of stuff written about the ACA and not just this one.
68,57,"This sub is full of funny, uninspiring, and uninformed comments. [Insert the word sexist](http://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbymoms/posts/comments/r/raisedbymoms/)"

57,35,I'd like to make a meme about it and also say that I don't like the idea of government and want to see it on TV.
57,47,It's funny and you're in a joke.
60,57,I'm assuming you aren't referring to the ACA.
68,57,I love the joke! That dickmasked cdc guy looks like the fuck out of the blue ::) They want to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I love the joke! That dickmasked cdc guy looks like the fuck out of the blue ::)
74,57,"The point of a movie is that people need to think they can be smarter than a cynical and self-righteous, sexist, violent, and rational, and just as a bit selfish as the people who aren't going to talk about the fact that they can't go to the doctor without a mask. The whole thing is funny, but not the joke. The whole thing is funny, but not the joke."
79,57,It's the best movie ever made.
86,57,What you're hearing isn't a joke. It's a real joke.
92,57,I don't see a way to get a troll in Australia. The people who are making the complaints are using an unproven system that's essentially being abused.
101,57,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
57,28,...but what's the point?
57,35,I was watching the show The Hulk with the lady in it. It was really good.

60,57,"There are a lot of issues and issues that are not on the agenda at this point, and it's not that there's no chance of the ACA being implemented."
68,57,This is going to be a funny and interesting post if I don't read it.
74,57,That's a really great way to tell it.
79,57,"The government is trying to cut the spread of the virus. I'm really blown away by the idea of a movie that's been made about the NSA, the CIA, the AIDS epidemic and the health system."
86,57,It is a joke. That's why we have the health systems. We're not going to fix the virus.
92,57,The article states that the government censored the coverage and access to health care as a way to save money and reduce the risk of causing diseases. It's also important to note that a lot of comments from the article are misleading and I would ask the obama administration for further explanation.
101,57,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
57,28,"You don't have to be smart or a troll to be a troll. If you aren't, you're going to have to be a troll to get people sick from wearing a mask and not be a troll to get sick from wearing a mask."

57,47,"Vaccines are not a prank. I've also been told to avoid making my face feel blood, because when I wear a mask I feel it being pulled into my face. I would fuck that up."
60,57,Is that what they want to do with the world? I don't know where to begin to figure that out.
68,57,They are just not really trying to get rid of the virus. There is a pretty fucking problem.

My wife was surprised to find him with a mask and he was upset to find out he was the one who pulled it off."
