90,30,The reason why I'm not a doctor is that the doctor was trying to get rid of all the toxins from the CDC. So I can see that the doctor was trying to get rid of the toxins from the CDC. Then it's not the CDC but the government.
97,30,"I don't see any reason why this is a joke. I just think it's a joke. I don't think he should play football or a basketball team. Those are all good jokes, but I think it isn't a joke."
101,30,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
35,30,...but then it has to be done with the government. It can't make you a good citizen. It's just a joke that's made out to be.

35,30,"Yes, there are people who don't understand what a mask is, but aren't completely sure what the ""fucking joke"" means."
86,30,"""The joke is a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke. It's a joke."""
90,30,“The whole thing seems to be blaming the 'police and people having no interest in what that means.
97,30,"""I think that it's pretty funny. It seems like it's a joke that isn't just about his AIDS problem. It's also a big deal that the players in the NFL are the only ones that are at fault for the president's AIDS problem."""

35,30,"A lot of people don't get the idea, because it isn't a joke. CDC doesn't have any sort of role in it and isn't trying to make it look bad. This is just a joke."
86,30,"If people were talking about a prank on the ACA and they wanted to stop the spread of HIV, they'd say the president trolled. The problem with the ACA is that there's nothing to stop."
90,30,I would say that the whole shaming of the book is a bad example.

86,30,"So, what are you going to say, because you think you know everything that I've said?"
90,30,I think the best way for a prankster to get to the point where the audience is dissatisfied with the film is to make a new comment and see what the new one is. The only way to get the audience to think is to spit on the book and see if the movie is worth re watching.
