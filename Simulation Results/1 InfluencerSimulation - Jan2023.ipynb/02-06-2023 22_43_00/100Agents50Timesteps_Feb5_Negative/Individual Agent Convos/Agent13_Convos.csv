13,1,The first two voting is a joke and the first was in a tv show.
13,12,The state of Utah is notorious for being a state of oblivion. You've never heard of that.
19,13,What the heck? I have never even heard about a resemblance. It looks like your gf has the right to wear a mask.
24,13,... oh my god. I hope the government will stop making it such a horrible thing.
36,13,It's hard to tell from the title what is going on but if the guy isn't wearing a mask he would be a rogue.
56,13,"Yes, I do and it helps me avoid the virus because it s incredibly dangerous."
58,13,"I'm not going to answer your question, but you did say you are against vacks mandates."
61,13,The people who scream about it get it.
72,13,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
86,13,> Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.see this is how crazy trump s made the united states of america
89,13,"I've seen it mentioned a lot. The woman wore the mask, it just looked like she had been wearing it for 10 years and then she was done."
98,13,I don't think anyone can stop me from ripping off the last couple of masks.
13,1,"I live in Utah, and the only one that doesn't know this is the state of Utah. Luckily, there is a good chance that the state has a health plan for the first 2 to go around."
13,12,This is something I would not be interested in seeing.
19,13,"In an interview, a guy whose husband wore a mask told the truth, in which he praised a guy for dressing properly in public."
24,13,They want us to stop wearing a mask and get vaccinated against the spread of the virus.
36,13,I was in high school and I just assumed that it was a joke about being a vaccinator.
56,13,It seems that the Federal government has done some work for them in this country. It seems that they have done some work for them.
58,13,I don't know how many people in the world can have a mask on? And you never know what kind of helmet can get that high.
61,13,">Why do people think you are gullible and submissive? Is it just to say that, no one wants to hear that."
72,13,Those are not facts. This is a part of what makes the US a superpower and not an evil one.
86,13,The article describes a way to protect against the virus.
89,13,"The first thing I did was to put on a mask. You can get it off if you are willing to do it. It's not as if you're going to need a mask in the future, just as if you are willing to do it yourself in the future unless you have to pay for the next one."
98,13,The government seems too obsessed with the death of the president to care for his mask.
13,1,They're not just trying to save our freedom. This is a way to prevent a lot of the shit from spreading.
13,12,"I've heard that the US government wants people to wear a mask that makes them feel more comfortable to their parents and their kids in order to stay safe. In my state, the government is the only one that sat in that position for 10 years, or so."
19,13,i am really not sure what you are trying to get across.
24,13,A mask will protect you from the virus from the health workers in the country and from other harmful bacteria (like shingles) if it isn't exposed to the correct vaccines. They are the only people in the country with a health care system that does not provide the necessary safety gear.
36,13,"Yes, it's the best way to stop a virus. But there is more to it than that."
56,13,I am very curious as to why they are doing the ACA as part of the measures deployed by the government.
58,13,> I hate it if the word 'dumbest' is 'hmmm..' But i feel like that's more like a saying than a response.
61,13,"It's called the ""moask to be vaccinated and let us get that to you"". A lot of people think wearing a mask is the best way to stop the spread of a virus. It is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. It is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
72,13,"It would be interesting to get a doctor to testify against the fact that this is the case in Georgia, but I doubt it's actually a good thing. It may help to show up in the mail, but it's a good thing that it is not the case."
86,13,"It is a very valid point, and a really valid point."
89,13,Wearing a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i've done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask
98,13,The first person to do it was me.
13,1,"I've been there before, and the person who posted this has my opinion on it."
13,12,I don't get why people think that it's so bad. I'm not sure why you're getting this downvoted.
19,13,I was at the same school as you...but I was also wearing a mask.
24,13,Vaccinating people against shingles is a bit different from a nirvana vaccine and a flu vaccine.
36,13,"I'm going to say that twitchcon and masks, where a guy has to wear a mask, is a joke, isn't just a joke, but a way to stop a virus, and is the best way to prevent it. I want to make a statement, but this guy is so bad he's just lying to me."
56,13,>But I'm curious as to why they are doing the ACA as part of the measures deployed by the government. It's pretty much what I thought.
58,13,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.No, that's exactly what they say."
61,13,I think it is very important to remember the importance of a mask. There's a lot of frightened 'depressed' people in the media who've been talking about vaccinating people in the past.
72,13,They're wasting their time and effort in the process. It's just that they're wasting their time and effort.
86,13,> They're just part of the measure used by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.The truth about the president being a shady asshole is that he is a shady asshole. The president does not need to wear a mask because he is not wearing a mask.
89,13,>I was thinking that the whole thing was a bad idea and that they're just using the wrong word to explain it.
98,13,"Trump was the first person to do this. This is the first guy to do it, and it seems like his stances are pretty nitpicky."
13,1,"It seems like we just have the media trying to tell us this, but we really need to know what is going on here."
13,12,I'd also say that this isn't a good idea.
19,13,"A syringe is a form of radiation that reaches into the skin causing a cold and putting the virus in your body - and if it's injected, that is considered a good idea. It's not exactly in the same sense as a real mask - but just like any other plastic in your body - which in turn means your skin is more receptive to the virus."
24,13,[I don't understand the difference between Vaccinating people and vaccinating against the spread of the virus.
36,13,"I have a mask that I used to wear to work a couple years ago and the only thing that got me in a position to change it was because I have no idea how to do it and can't even get into a position that I would be able to change it, I think they are actually quite good at it - they do what they can but it doesn't mean I need to do it."
56,13,"It's not a matter of ""the ACA being part of the measure deployed by the government"" but about whether a government is willing to compromise its own way of dealing with the problems we have."
58,13,"And because the people who are defending the NSA aren't doing this, they're saying that it's the most effective way to combat HIV. That's why they don't blatantly imply that it's a security issue."
61,13,">Was the same joke that happened with this movie and is also an attempt to have a conversation. This has no bearing on any person. You wear a mask that is not as effective as it used to be. You do not wear a helmet that you wouldn't wear in a public place, as the NSA can't systematically protect you."
72,13,">I mean I mean the joke is so cheesy and insulting. The mask is not a good thing, it's just a shit thing, it's not the most evil thing ever. It's like a joke."
86,13,The article describes a way to protect against the virus.
89,13,"You've never been to a Restaraunt and you've had no intention of having one. The first thing you did was to get a mask off and then do it, even if you've only been there for 10 years. If you got sick, you'd have to put on a mask. But if you can't, you're going to have to fuck off the mask, and have it taken off."
98,13,Is the virus still a threat? That would be too hard to believe
13,1,"I think a lot of the time I don't like the idea of a mask because I don't think it helps the virus, which is what I'm getting at here."
13,12,a lot of people like this one.
19,13,It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask in public is a joke.
24,13,It's so sad to hear that our health care system is overreacting and the people who do it will continue to retaliate in the slightest. But I think a lot of people will do it.
36,13,"The fact that you're talking about a real twat is a great example of how you can be an asshole, but I doubt any of those things are true, or even even that they are true."
56,13,i'm the guy that thinks he's a dick and a sneeze and a jab.
58,13,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
61,13,>Was the same joke that happened with this movie and is also an attempt to have a conversation.
72,13,"i am not going to lie to you, but the NSA has been doing a lot of depressing things because of its behavior. i dont know how they're going to do that because it's not a reputable health center. i don't know how to deal with a virus in the states. i can't really tell if it is just a joke but that it is a narcissistic thing to do"
86,13,"This is a good thing that I am not a doctor, but I think I can do it. There is nothing wrong with putting on a mask."
89,13,"...As the doctor, you were wearing a mask that was supposed to prevent the spread of a virus."
98,13,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. So, the message for the post was that the president is being slandered based on how he treated the situation in the United States. Then the president said something that is pretty blatantly wrong based on his political beliefs. I think a lot of people would feel the same way. I really don't like wearing a mask. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
13,1,"I mean I mean the joke is so cheesy and insulting. The mask is not a good thing, it's just a shit thing, it's not the most evil thing ever. It's like a joke. It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask in public is a joke."
13,12,There's actually a whole series of subs with the same titles.
19,13,This is a serious health issue. It doesn't matter that the ACA affects more people than it does. This is a big deal. I think they've probably already taken the first step in getting rid of the police.
24,13,I don't think people are trying to get around a government retaliation against a vaccine in the US.
36,13,It is not a joke. It is the one that makes the joke that everyone is just trying to make people realize the joke is a joke.
56,13,He's saying that wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government. He's trying to push for the ACA to be repealed. If the ACA is actually repealed by the president it would be the same thing.
58,13,"So, I'm going to say: I don't know how many people can have a helmet on? And you never know what kind of helmet can get that high. I'm sure a lot of people wouldn't realize that helmets and masks are used to contaminate a person's blood vessels. I've read somewhere that helmets and masks are used to control the spread of the AIDS virus. It is the only way to prevent that because the AIDS virus could be spread as quickly as a virus in a game and I don't know why the"
61,13,You are the only one who can explain this to the person who asked about it and that you do not want to know about it?
72,13,I think you're getting your points in here:
86,13,Is there a specific type of mask that the president must wear? I see no reason to put it on.
89,13,This movie makes me think that it's a joke. I'm going to be on my own.
98,13,Vaccination is important. It stops it from spreading around the world.
13,1,The president has been telling us that it's a big deal and that the joke is a joke. It's a good thing and a joke.
13,12,It's a joke.
19,13,A mask doesn't cause a virus. I think it is a joke. It's not a joke. It is a joke. It is a joke.
24,13,I can't believe that a person is going through a restaraunt and a person is walking in there.
36,13,I'm pretty sure that's a joke.
56,13,I believe this is a really well known statement.
58,13,"I'm going to say: I don't know how many people in the world can have a helmet on? And you never know what kind of helmet can get that high."", ""But i feel like that's more like a saying than a response."""
61,13,"CANNOTANSWER: I love coaching however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops. CANNOTANSWER: ""I agree with you here that it's disrespectful to ask people for help when there are a lot of people who don't care about how they are treated but are aware that a mask that is not used or worn properly would be harmful to your health."
72,13,I would love to have a little look around and read the rest of the comments and find out if there's anything in the movie that is actually related to this?
86,13,"""We're going to put a big tldr on your website today. Let's make sure we don't annoy people and send them a message that the President cannot use it."""
89,13,The idea is pretty funny. I think it's a fucking silly joke that the government is 'helping'.
98,13,I think that the next time someone wants to change their mind about a mask it’s going to be with the CIA and the government.
13,1,I'm not sure why you would say a fucking joke.
13,12,This is what happened to the president of the CIA and the CIA. The government wants to get rid of the ACA.
19,13,"Is your favorite band coming? I just want them to give them to you. You've given me a nice and supportive attitude, and I'm hoping you will like it."
24,13,"This is an example of a poor joke. A doctor is not supposed to tell you that ""he is in fact trying to get around this government retaliation."""
36,13,"I know a few things about people who wear masks. I love the movie, but I don't have any of the details of the story."
56,13,"""Well dear the gun works the gun doesn't"""
58,13,">Heading a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I'm going to call the NSA the ""Nazi machine"" for a moment and let you know that I'm not sure what that is."
61,13,When I worked at a university I had to wear a mask because I was sick of being a clown and I was constantly kicking myself for wearing it and I was so embarrassed I couldn't even talk about it.
72,13,I see what you mean. I think the film is a great book. I love that satire of the government.
86,13,">I'm a big fan of the shady hating attitude of the President. He is a dick and a fucking hypocrite, I've seen a lot of bad behavior when I was an adult."""
89,13,I think that the joke is stupid.
98,13,I know you're getting a bit upset about the article and how it seems a little misleading. But the whole idea of the mask is still valid and they aren't very well known in the U.S.
13,1,I think that's exactly what this movie focuses on.
13,12,I'm an American who has not read any of this.
19,13,"I don't think the problem with the ACA is that there are people who wear a mask in public because they have the immunity to infection and lack of adequate protection. The people who wear a mask in public are being exploited, not people who don't wear masks in public."
24,13,"Those people should have a shield and some form of contact to prevent the spread of shingles. If he goes in the US without it, he is likely not in the UK."
36,13,This is what you will hear in the next few days.
56,13,"You do not seem to understand the entire article, but I have to say it's pretty funny."
58,13,That is a big lie.
61,13,The fact that he is wearing a mask is a huge red flag.
72,13,I'd like to be in the movie right now.
86,13,The post has been viewed as a prank.
89,13,"The movie is over the top because the hammer is a joke. People wear it to stop the spread of a virus, it's not a joke. People don't say the joke in the movie, but the joke in the movie is ""Feel like a baby, but without an epidural."" People wear masks to stop people from being able to walk like that if it is a joke. I think the movie is one of the best movies of all time. The only funny bit about the movie is how the writer"
98,13,"That article was misleading and misleading in that it had a message that the president is being slandered based on his political beliefs. But I think that the other guy's statement was misleading, claiming that the Obama administration is too obsessed with AIDS to care for it. The article says that the president should wear a mask to stop the spread of the virus. I think the author is getting a little upset about the article and how it seems a little misleading."
13,1,So... why did it get censored?
13,12,">Well dear the gun works the gun doesn't"""
19,13,People can't just say whatever they want about the ACA.
24,13,"The only thing that could possibly do anything wrong with that is go to the doctor. If your doc is making any claims for that, you have absolutely nothing to worry about."
36,13,We don't have a lot to say about this... but it's a fad.... and there isn't anything you can say.
56,13,"if he were running it I think that is where he would get some sympathy, which isn't something that he would have to do for the sake of this shit."
58,13,"I've been reading a lot of great articles about this, and they're both great articles on this topic."
61,13,This CANNOTANSWER is very similar to how you're describing a person who has been told that they should wear a mask if they can't feel them.
72,13,I've seen a lot of bad behavior when I was an adult.
86,13,The article doesn't even state that wearing a mask makes the president feel like a dick.
89,13,"I think I have seen that movie, and I agree."
98,13,"Vaccination is important. It stops it from spreading around the world. A great way to look at the world, it's a great way to understand the world."
13,1,">I'm not sure why you would say a fucking joke. The mask is not a good thing, it's just a shit thing, it's not the most evil thing ever."
13,12,I have to disagree with your other comment. I think the entire article is a bit misleading. Its just that the president is being censored by the media and is a prank.
19,13,"The point of this post is that the government isn't in a position to protect the public. Unless it's a shitballed attempt to protect the people, I'd say it's not a joke. The NSA is trying to take things to a halt because it's the biggest risk to the health of the US and thus they can't use it effectively."
24,13,I just wanted to ask. Why is wearing a mask important? It's not a troll. It's a joke.
36,13,"I think this is the simplest way to put it. It seems like it's going to get more attention, even from the government."
56,13,It was written with the intent to discredit the NSA for not doing the right thing.
58,13,"I'm not going to give you a response, but I'll tell you something along the lines of:"
61,13,>I'm an advocate for removing the government's involvement in preventing the spread of a virus.

89,13,I'm a medical professional. You're putting this one wrong.
98,13,"The article, if you have to take it with a grain of salt, is misleading."
13,1,"Yes, this is not a joke. It's a prank. This is a joke. It's a joke. This is the kind of thing the government needs to do in order to stop the spread of the virus."
13,12,"I am not even sure what you mean. This is an insinuation that the NSA wants to keep the government from implementing the ACA, but that the US doesn't want to be the biggest threat to the US."
19,13,"That's one thing, the ACA is a joke, but it is not an actual measure. The ACA does not affect people that are immune to infectious diseases. This is what the ACA aims to tackle. It is a joke, and it is one of the measures that is deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. This is not a joke."
24,13,That's not a joke.
36,13,I'd say it's funny and not a joke.
56,13,It sounds like the whole article has been discredited. The ACA is a prank.
58,13,"That's a lot of people's point. You're trying to get them to stop the ACA, which has so many fucking trolls that you should be ashamed of yourself. I'm not gonna say 'can I have a pity party for your choice, but I'm sure a lot of people would be.'"
61,13,This is the kind of thing that I get to do. I get a lot of shit.

It's about how the syringe smears into your skin, making it look more like a syringe.

56,13,I believe it is an attempt to discredit the CIA's role in helping prevent the spread of AIDS.
58,13,This is why people like you are not really in the US at all.
61,13,This is one of the first times I've heard it:
72,13,"This is actually the movie that's called ""The Man I See Was an Angry Man."" It is a movie about the president's policy to help the people of America with the AIDS epidemic."
86,13,"I am not a doctor, but I know what the NSA is doing is wrong. That's the whole point of a mask. It's a prank. It's not a joke. It's a joke."

98,13,I am a little surprised he has been able to have a good time and just a little bit of a good one to go on this.
13,1,It’s been in a lot of r/newspapers lately. A lot of them aren’t accurate.
13,12,... and a whole series of subs with the same titles.
19,13,... and I have not heard of it.
24,13,The idea behind the mask is that it prevents the spread of AIDS.
36,13,The article states that it is a joke because Donald J. Trump is wearing a mask. It is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
56,13,"It's a joke, but the first part isn't."
58,13,>But i feel like that's more like a saying than a response.
61,13,The movie is a comedy about the NSA's role in the spread of the virus. I wonder how much of the rape is gonna happen if we don't fuck the president.
72,13,"AIDS is not the only problem. It is also the number 1 cause for the world's deaths with it. In fact, a number of people die from it and many people are born with it."
86,13,The fucking truth!
89,13,"No matter how much the movie gets paid, a hat is a funny joke. I think it's actually the first movie I've ever seen that mentions the ""poor"" hats."
98,13,The president is wearing a mask to stop the spread of the virus. He didn't say that he was 'destroyed' based on his political beliefs.
13,1,It's been the longest one.
13,12,"So many things. One of them is he is the victim of the AIDS epidemic, which was actually caused by his hat. The other was that the President of CIA is not the president of CIA. It is because his hat is the cause of AIDS, which is the greatest problem in the world."
19,13,"So the joke that's coming up is, ""Making a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things I've ever done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask""."
24,13,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.The guy who was a great candidate for president is a dick.

I think that's exactly how it's
36,13,The article is more a reference to the ACA. And to the actual hat.
56,13,Obamacare is supposed to stop the spread of a virus.
58,13,"They said that the ACA, which is supposed to stop the spread of AIDS. But the ACA doesn't actually affect the population and the public doesn't really care about it. If they aren't implementing it, then it will be ineffective and they will be going after the government."

86,13,"I thought it was funny that the story is about the ACA and that the joke is about the president not being a doctor, but he doesn't care what he says about it. It doesn't even mention the fact that he was a doctor or something. So the joke is that it sounds funny."
89,13,In this case it's a joke. People are still wearing masks for fun. This is a joke.
98,13,I don't understand why people want to be on the AIDS scene and have a conversation about this. I'm not being smacked on by this guy.

61,13,The president needs to put his mask on first because he doesn't think people are crazy to him. So he should wear a mask and get vaccinated.
72,13,"It's about the pranks of the government. The AIDS vaccines have been known to get people to stop talking to the AIDS victims. There is an article in the Journal of Public Health that says that it will get people to stop talking to the AIDS patients and that AIDS is not a virus, just a prank."
86,13,The ACA is the only thing that was ever actually known as a prank:
89,13,The reason I find this joke hilarious is because I know that it makes me think that it is a joke. I don't think there's any more jokes in the movie that don't include the idea of being able to walk like that.

24,13,This is a joke based on the fact that there is no such thing as a 'dick joke'.
36,13,"I would say it's a joke, because I think it is the way to stop the ACA from happening. If it's something we're talking about, this article is going to make people uncomfortable and it's a joke. It doesn't mean it's a joke."

13,12,"i don't know if you know what the ACA is or not, but the scma i was using was a joke. what you're referring to is what is essentially a scma and the hat is a joke."
19,13,The joke about the pranks is not about the jokes - it's about how people are being exploited and have to get tested for their virus.
24,13,Vaccinating the President does not prevent the spread of AIDS.

86,13,"The Obama Administration's huuuuge failure to put the ""asshole mask"" of the Obama administration in the top 3 most important areas of the government's agenda to date is a prank on me. It seems like people are going to think ""Well, I think putting on a mask is a joke."""

61,13,"""The president is being a sleazy troll."
72,13,I do not see what your point of view is.

72,13,We've seen this before. What else is this about?
86,13,The President is wearing a mask in this thread. That's how he is portrayed. The President is being portrayed as a liar and in a twisted way.

58,13,"As a Democrat who was essentially at the forefront of the ACA, I'd like to point out that the ACA is basically just a piece of legislation to prevent people from having the AIDS virus on their head when they're on their feet, and the ACA is intended to do that as a way to stop HIV."
61,13,It was the right movie. I thought this was a ripoff. I'm pretty sure he just wanted to make sure. It didn't sound like he was in danger of being attacked. It's pretty clear from his title.

24,13,This isn't the first time anyone has made a joke. It's actually been stated many times.
36,13,The article is a little misleading. The article is not a joke. The author is not defending the ACA. The article is a joke because it's not a joke. The ACA doesn't exist because the president is in charge of the ACA repeal. The article states that it's a joke because it's a prank and a joke because it addresses the problem of HIV/AIDS. The ACA is being repealed by the gov't. And congress.
56,13,The President is trying to'move the shit out' if he is not happy.
58,13,"If your stance is anti-war, then you're essentially saying it's a joke. The author of the article is '...' I don't understand why the CDC is working on the ACA - it is just a joke to stop people from having a racial or ethnic grouping."
61,13,>Cannotanyanwer is the author of a book called Chilli's List. I just wanted to make sure. The author is clearly in a coma with the trolls.

86,13,"Considering you are reading the whole thing, I think there is one major point. This is not a prank. It's a joke. The ACA is one of the worst pranks to date. It was passed for the purpose of keeping a doctor away from the public health system."
89,13,"The hat, the hat... the hat..."
98,13,"This is why the author is asking questions. This article, is an actual discussion of the president's policies. If the writer doesn't have any idea what they're trying to do, then he's doing it incorrectly."
13,1,"""This is the kind of thing the government needs to do in order to stop the spread of the AIDS epidemic."""
13,12,i just realized that there is a lot of different things being said in the article about the ACA besides that it is a joke.

58,13,"There is a lot of nonsense about the ACA, and that's exactly what they are trying to convey. The ACA was a joke, and the article seems to just cover a lot of the jokes and facts about the ACA."

89,13,I think it is a joke because people aren't able to wear a mask to stop people from walking like that.
98,13,This is about a presidential candidate who is talking about a problem that should be addressed with a retort and a few minutes of discussion. There is no reason to think it's a 'political issue'.

24,13,"The first paragraph is probably a joke but based on what someone says is a joke, which I am sure is a joke, is what it is. It isn't a joke at all, it's an obnoxious and misleading joke, a blatant fraud. I am just saying it's not what people like to write about. It's basically an idiocy that goes into a whole new direction: if it's not a joke then you are doing it wrong, but it's a joke. I'm just saying"
36,13,He's trying to prevent the spread of AIDS in some ways. I don't think that's funny. I think it's a joke because it's a prank.
56,13,A prankster who is trying to get the president to repeal the ACA. A prankster.
58,13,"As the author said, the most obvious explanation to this is that the president isn't at fault for the ACA. It's a joke."

72,13,"That's a really funny joke. It's kind of like a prank, and it's probably not in my opinion."
86,13,a prank is a joke
89,13,Basically OP is trying to make the joke about the government allowing them to pass off hats as a joke.
98,13,The article states that AIDS is one of the most common kinds of mental illness affecting people. I think he is making a good point here.
13,1,"The Obama Administration is the president's primary target, and as such, the CDC is an active member of the CDC. The government doesn't knowingly allow people to buy hats when they're in a position to protect them. It's one of their primary sources of funding, but it's not their primary source."

36,13,I'm not a doctor but I do work with people who wear hats. I think I have a strong opinion that is backed by the evidence that this is a joke. I have an opinion that is based on fact. I don't think you have a scientific base for a joke. Whether or not that is a joke is irrelevant.
56,13,I read it and I think I just wanted to say it was pretty funny and I'm curious as to why they are doing the ACA as part of the measures deployed by the government.
58,13,"I'm so sorry but I think that this is a little sexist, and if it isn't made into a joke, that it doesn't deserve to be."
61,13,"""Want to be vaccinated and let us get that to you"""
72,13,I think the CDC is using the same hat as a hat and I think it's the wrong thing to do. This movie argues that it is actually a joke and that they are doing it as a joke. It's about the CDC's effort to stop AIDS and the CDC wants to stop it. They are not giving us the right information. It's an important thing. They have been making a lot of pranks about it and it's probably not what they were supposed to do. Likewise if the movie were to begin with?
86,13,"As the title says, it’s the president not going to get shot, but a fucking doctor will. A fucking scumbag."
89,13,I don't get it. I'm not saying it's a joke. I just want to make a joke.
98,13,"I'm a Republican, and I would be too. I think it would be better to have a book called The Emperor about him and his policy on HIV/AIDS prevention."

36,13,The joke about wearing a mask is a joke about the guy who isn't the leader of the government.
56,13,I read this as a joke and wanted to get my point across.
58,13,a lot of people wouldn't realize that helmets and masks are used to contaminate a person's blood vessels.
61,13,''I think that it is very important to remember the importance of a mask. There's a lot of frightened 'depressed' people in the media who've been talking about vaccinating people in the past.
72,13,The story is that the government wants to stop the spread of AIDS and that it's the only thing it can do to help. The movie isn't a joke. It's a joke.

89,13,"It's a joke and a prank, so I won't repeat it to you."
98,13,"You're probably overestimating what the author's point was.

The author simply doesn't have the information to be able to put his point across."
13,1,A prank? Because the only way to stop the spread of the AIDS epidemic is to prank the people who wear them because they don't want to live in America.

58,13,"The word ""scumbag"" is used to describe a phrase that was used by the CIA to represent the ""Nazi Machine"" at the time. It's meant to portray an entire subset of scumbags who've been trying to get the president to stop the spread of HIV."

56,13,IANAL. So the guy's a prankster. I know it's kind of a joke but I think it's a good joke.
58,13,'Can't stand the idea of wearing masks.
61,13,There is more to the ACA than just one person pranking.

86,13,Is there a certain type of mask that he is supposed to wear to protect against HIV?
89,13,People wear hats to stop people from being able to walk like that. People wear hats to stop people from having sex without hats. People wear hats to stop people from having sex without hats. People wear hats to stop people from having sex without hats. People wear hats to stop people from having sex without hats. People wear hats to stop people from having sex without hats.

19,13,"The ACA aims to destroy the US healthcare system, which will make this issue worse by giving them more power to make the system work"
24,13,I think the reason this was said was because some of the jokes were not relevant to the topic.
36,13,I think you mean the hat is the right answer? Because you can't really use it as a joke. It's a prank.
56,13,What did he do to get Obama to repeal the ACA? He was putting a joke together about the ACA.
58,13,"""Cannot stand the idea of wearing a mask in public."""
61,13,The president can be the first to say it's a joke. That's the joke I heard in the movie.
72,13,The CDC has the resources to do the AIDS vaccines. This prank makes sense because it can get people to stop talking to AIDS victims because it's a bad joke.
86,13,The ACA is one of the worst pranks to date. It isn't about stopping the spread of the AIDS epidemic. It is a joke. But the ACA is about helping to prevent the spread of AIDS. It isn't supposed to prevent the spread of AIDS.
89,13,"I don't think this is a joke because if the hat is not actually a joke, it's not a joke. Is it just a joke that people are wearing it to stop people from being able to walk without hats?"
98,13,This is why I never get to sit down to have a conversation with him. The author is trying to give me this very same perspective but the book is not the answer.
13,1,The article says he's wearing the mask because he's a doctor. It's a joke because he's an ACA repealer.
13,12,People wear masks to protect themselves from the AIDS epidemic and to make their kids feel safe. I know that's a pretty common joke to tell people but I know what the president is trying to get.
19,13,"It seems pretty weird to me that this is the joke that has been put in the title. I know it's been there, but in a nutshell, that's it."
24,13,It's also a prank because the article makes you think it's the only way to stop the spread of the virus if it makes you angry.
36,13,"I am trying to put a ""hat as the only solution to stop the spread of AIDS. You don't deserve to get to see a hat in public. You don't deserve to get hit by a hat."""

58,13,"Isn't it a bit of a ""sorry if you haven't seen this movie, but you don't have the nerve to say it!"""
61,13,The doctor in the film is a prankster.
72,13,"This is my favorite comment: ""I think it's a joke, but it's also not the right thing to do. This movie makes sense because it can get people to stop talking to AIDS victims because it's a good idea."
86,13,I think this is a bit out of line. The post that says this is an example of a lack of proper protection is actually misleading. It is also misleading because of the ACA and it sounds like a prank.
89,13,"They should be ashamed. It's not just a prank, it's an effort to save someone from the shit and the prank is a joke, not a prank."
98,13,I think that I need to find a friend that has the courage to go on a movie and watch the movie.
13,1,"I don't really know anything about the ACA. It's a joke. You could say the joke is a joke because he's a doctor and you've seen the movie, but I don't know what it means."
13,12,I am a very good doctor but I am not a doctor. My first thought is that people like to wear masks.
19,13,The title of the article doesn't mention that the ACA is a joke.
