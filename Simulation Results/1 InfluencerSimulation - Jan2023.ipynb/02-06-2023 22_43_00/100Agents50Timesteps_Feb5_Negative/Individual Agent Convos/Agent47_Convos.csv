78,47,"If the president didn't act like he did, he would be on the other side of the aisle. I could probably just laugh and say ""I don't really know what it means."""
85,47,"You don't like the president, you just don't like the government."
86,47,No wonder some people don't know who they're talking about.

101,47,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
47,6,The fact that this sexist comment is not being made in a constructive way (which is what most people seem to think is incorrect) is indicative of this article.
47,15,"I am very sorry to say, but I don't know what a prank or prank is."
47,44,I don't see a case of president vs. obama being a troll to the government.

64,47,"I don't know what to say, but I drew the line between a person who had to wear a mask and the person who didn't, and how a person who can't have a problem wearing a mask and just being a dick with a faked smile is an idiot."

70,47,"I don't understand what you're looking at. The first CIA agent on the scene is a friend of mine that was recently in an exchange for a mask to wear outside a car. The first one was on his car, and one of them said a ""Phoenix is the best place to come if you want to be in that movie"". That was one of the last time I've seen a CIA agent in person and I figured out how to get the CIA to go to the NSA and ask a person to wear a mask to"
75,47,"'You seem to think the NSA is the only solution to stop AIDS, right?'"
78,47,And he is trying to get his friends to stop putting on a mask. The only way he's going to go is if he can actually help people without being in an inhumane way.
85,47,That's not the government's job.

101,47,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
47,6,I've been told that the only way to stop AIDS is to get vaccinated.

57,47,It's funny and you're in a joke.
62,47,The article isn't a joke and there are plenty of examples.
64,47,The problem is that the government is unable to communicate effectively. It's what the government is supposed to do.
67,47,It sounds like the Obama administration is a tyrant who wants to stop the spread of AIDS.
70,47,"'I'm a politician, not a legislator, not a doctor.'"
75,47,"""Survival is one of the first steps to keeping our children safe. Vaccines are an essential tool. Vaccines are a key component of all other treatments to prevent AIDS from spreading. A mask is the most important part of the program to prevent this virus."""
78,47,No wonder we're all shivering.
85,47,"I agree that the government's strategy is very immoral, as the ACA is so much more effective than it has been in the past."
86,47,"I've been in the Obama administration for a while. We're talking about the actual government intervention to stop the spread of AIDS. If the government doesn't change its stance on the issue, the public health system should be reorganised."
94,47,"I think it's pretty cool that a male who wears a mask in public would wear a mask, because a woman doesn't want to become a police officer."
101,47,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
47,6,"And if the president doesn't like the way the article is being written, the question is whether or not he's going to help with that."
47,15,"It's a joke that's supposed to make people sick. I'd get a sick pill, get the vaccinated, go to a doctor, and have my AIDS tested. I would get sick. I didn't know it was that important."
47,44,"> You're implying that you are wearing a mask for the fear of getting vaccinated, which is very inappropriate."

57,47,>If I wanted to be a troll I would like to be a troll who tries to get people to eat... I'd like to make a meme about it and also say that I don't like the idea of government and want to see it on TV. It's funny and you're in a joke.
62,47,"In some cases I'd say the whole ""Answers on the bill"" part is a little dumb, but you can also say, ""I think you're being a dick. I'm not sure if anyone here is aware of this. I'm sorry but I am a dick. I think he should be in a better place and this situation is going to be a dick story."

47,6,I don't think it's a sexist thing to say to someone when they have AIDS. They just say the people in the picture are incredibly insensitive and not very well trained.

47,44,"It was funny and tidbits, but not funny and not tidbits."
55,47,"As a politician, a mask isn't exactly an issue. It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. The president is not a troll. The Obama administration is obsessed with the AIDS virus. The president is not a troll."
57,47,"Vaccines are not a prank. I've also been told to avoid making my face feel blood, because when I wear a mask I feel it being pulled into my face. I would fuck that up."

57,47,"It's not a joke, it's an issue. We don't need the govt to fix this problem or any other government policy."
62,47,I think the government does have an obligation to vaccinate the people at the con.
64,47,"I can't think of a more relevant one. I'd be willing to go read that and go find an article defending the government's anti-HIV vaccine and vaccinating, or I could read this on my own, but I'd be willing to have a very hefty handshake."
67,47,"No, I'm against wearing a mask."
70,47,My wife is not on the CDC Advisory Board and she has no authority to say anything about the situation.

55,47,We need to stop being a politician as a social event. To stop the spread of AIDS?
57,47,I feel like a prank for wearing a mask is the right thing to do in a real world context: Is it possible to be a prankster with the idea that he was doing this?
62,47,It's just a joke. The ACA is a joke. It does not violate the constitution.
64,47,Isn't the ACA part of the US government's anti-HIV vaccine?
67,47,"The title is misleading. If someone has a problem with the government, they should say, 'I'm against the ACA, I'm against the ACA, I'm against the ACA'. I'm not against the ACA, I'm against the ACA. The title is misleading. People don't want to have any rights on the NHS. We can't stop the spread of AIDS. The article's title is misleading."

55,47,It was a joke. There was an article on it. There are a lot of people that are actually a big fan of the AIDS virus and a lot of 'people' that are a big fan of it. Vaccination is a key policy. It's not an antisemitic act and it's not exactly antisemitic at all. It's just a joke.

But, he's not actually a tyrant who wants to get rid of anything because he can't do anything that is supposed to stop the spread of AIDS.'' That is the whole point of the mask.

47,44,"AIDS and AIDS are very different.

75,47,CANNOTANSWER’S BAD PARTY: Wearing a medical mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. The fact that people are willing to take risks with a vaccine does not make it illegal to take one. The fact that some are willing to take a risk does not make it legal. Vaccines are not an unavoidable part of the program.
