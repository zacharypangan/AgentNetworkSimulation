74,48,"I remember this because I was born with a mask and was the first one to get bitten in the neck by a tickle of a virus. I felt so much better when I saw a rat eat me and I didn't like a mask. I wore it to go a little faster and faster than most people, but that's all it took."
74,49,I'm actually so sick of the newest strain of virus I've never even heard of.
74,50,"They said it to the government to stop the spread of the virus, they have not done it yet."

74,70,And he has been getting it since he got it
74,72,Oh my god I have never been able to breathe properly since having to wear a mask. I don't think I'm able to breathe without it. I feel like it is really too hard to just put a mask on because of some sort of infection.
90,74,They have a mask on their hands pics don t mean they re using it yes the newest strain is soooooo contagious just bc they have a mask on their hands pics don t mean they re using it
74,2,"In our state the government has to put a protective barrier on their throats, so that anyone who is bitten by a virus can be screened for it and the hives from it aren't exposed."
74,18, You can breathe in the air with your face down.
74,33,"I was born with a mask, but I haven't worn one since I was about 7 months old."
74,46,"So I wear my mask, I get a hard time breathing after sitting on it for two days, my husband is terribly ill, and I'm still sick of him, and he's doing better now than I've ever done before. So I can go back to it if I'm not sick again, but I have to wear it, and I'm also getting a lot of sick."
74,48,"OP: The newest strain of virus, ""Maroon"", was actually actually the first bitten by a tickle of a virus, a virus that is not an actual virus. The one from the rat was bitten in the neck by a tickle of a virus, a virus that is not a rat that is not a tickle. The rat bit me while I wore a mask, and was bitten by a tickle, not even a virus. I was bitten by a tickle of a virus, so it"
74,49,"Basically the only thing people want to talk about is a bit of a jerk reaction to the whole ""Ooh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having"
74,50,"If you're sick of the virus, you might want to check your medical records. I don't see any evidence of them spreading it on the internet."
74,57,Why not use a mask with the same type of mask?
74,63,[RENT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RENT_Of_Measurements_of_A_Measurements_of_A_Measurements_of_A_Measurements) is a website for people who wear masks for other reasons. It allows users to use the masks for many different reasons.

90,74,You don't really need to wear a mask to keep the virus away from you.
74,2,"I just can't believe that I haven't heard the term maroon, but I know that it's not one that people who wear a mask can think about."
74,18,"Is there a way to get your husband to have a second look? Do you have a rat? If so, then I don't think you need a mask. The first is not a virus that is spread through the blood of a mosquito, but it's a virus that is infecting your throat."
74,33,"I know you're sick and a little crazy but if you're sick, you'll probably need to consult your health care professional. The government has to put a barrier on their throats so that anyone who is bitten by a virus can be screened for it and the hives from it aren't exposed."
74,46,"i know that that is so ridiculous, i guess i should say i am sick of it too, but that just shows the level of ignorance in our society, and i have the ability to deal with it so I just need to have a look at it."

74,57,You might want to check your medical records. I don't see any evidence of them spreading it on the internet. Why not use a mask with the same type of mask?
74,63,It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
74,70,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
74,72,"I've always said that because when I was younger, I felt that I didn't really like wearing a mask and that was the kind of thing I did in high school. I never thought about wearing a mask because I didn't know anything about the science of what it was, and I didn't want to go on an adventure in a world where someone else would have that."
90,74,What does a mask have to do with the spread of a disease?
74,2,The government is going to have to do a lot to help stop the spread of this disease. There is one thing I'm more worried about...
74,18,This guy is just putting the mask on himself. He's a jerk.
74,33,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. OP:
74,46,I think most people would just start putting their face in a strange shape so that it doesn't come off as a tad weird.
74,48,"The first is not a virus that is spread through the blood of a mosquito, but it's a virus that is infecting your throat. I know that's so ridiculous, i guess i should say i am sick of it too, but that just shows the level of ignorance in our society, and i have the ability to deal with it so I just need to have a look at it."
74,49,"It's a problem with the way the government does things, and the number of people who wear a mask is too small."
74,50,"This guy is just getting in trouble for saying this he can't stop wearing his mask because it's causing a fever. This is why it should not be used at the moment because we don't know how to use it or what the difference is between ""I don't need to wear a mask to keep the virus away from me"", and ""I'm a young man and I have a hard time breathing with my mouth open."""
74,57,"So, why do you need a mask? You don't, in this case, need a mask that prevents the spread of a virus."
74,63,"Because, as others have mentioned, it's not possible for someone to be sick from an infection without wearing a mask, and it's possible for someone to live without a mask, but only if they're sick or sick from a bug or something, such as a tickle. The CDC figured that this was a possible source, not just an actual virus that is actually the first bitten by a tickle of a virus. This was a rare disease."
74,70,I can't believe that it's a thing.
74,72,"There's a lot of stupid jokes, but the ones that are thrown around in the comments are all hilarious. It would be cool to know that you have a rat in your mouth and then see if anyone else will take it."
90,74,"This is the problem of the healthcare industry. It's a problem of the government in general. That's why it has no interest in limiting its use. If the government doesn't want to do it in the first place, it will only push it to an extent."
74,2,"What is the definition of a ""skin numbness""? Is it a thing? Why can't you just say that when you don't know you're sick of it?"
74,18,Nope. This is a joke that seems to be trolled all over the web.
74,33,"I can't imagine that a bunch of sarcastic, stupid jokes on r/Racists are out there!"
74,46,"[NAME] is also a part of the government, and the government doesn't want to interfere with it."
74,48,"The government should be able to protect people from tickles, and if that's the case, they'll do the same thing if they try to scare people away."
74,49,"In this case, I think the answer is ""We want to stop spreading a virus."""
74,50,This is one of the biggest problems we have with the government.
74,57,I'm glad he didn't just take a rat bite because of it.
74,63,"...and no one wants to talk about that Unless you're a big fan of the rat hives, I don't know what to say. You might want to check your medical records. I don't see any evidence of them spreading it on the internet. Why not use a mask with the same type of mask? It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
74,70,I believe it's the mask people wear that's getting infected.
74,72,It's not the government. It's the government.
90,74,"If you don't wear a mask to keep the virus away from you, you can't buy one."
74,2,It's not just a joke. It's a joke.
74,18,"I am sick and confused, as the other comments seem to suggest."
74,33,"They said ""Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
74,46,"The biggest problem we have with the government isn't the government, but the state. The state is the government. It's the federal government. It should be able to protect people from virus transmission through a program to prevent them from having it spread through blood from a mosquito. The first is not a virus that is spread through the blood of a mosquito, but it's a virus that is infecting your throat. I know that's so ridiculous, i guess i should say i am sick of it too, but that just shows the level of ignorance in our"
74,48,"You might be a little crazy, but you may have a very sarcastic attitude towards the fact that in that case you are wrong."
74,49,Why did the government want to do that?
74,50,"The problem with the government isn't with the way people think. It's with the government. You can't go without a mask and it's like saying 'I'm a kid and I'm sick of it, but you need to see what it means.'"
74,57,I would fuck that up.
74,63,"i think the government needs to get to the bottom of it. this whole thing is ridiculous, the only thing that can be fixed is that if there is a rat in your mouth that is still sick, and you don't have a mask to keep it from the other people, it won't cause a fever. it's a common ailment that isn't well understood. it's probably just a temporary problem or something to do with a big cliche."
74,70,"I've always known there's something to be said that's a joke, and I've never heard that phrase before."
74,72,">Is it the government? It's the government. If you don't wear a mask to keep the virus away from you, you can't buy one."
90,74,"I like your dad. He is one of the most incestuous people. I mean, he's the same person who was the worst President for two whole decades."
74,2,This is a very common ailment that isn't well understood. It's not just a joke. It's a joke.
74,18,What is this about? There is no way I've seen a joke with a rat on my head that's not even a joke.
74,33,"I was a little kid at the time, and that wasn't an issue."
74,46,It's not a joke. It's a lie. You don't understand what it is that people are saying.
74,48,You are an asshole.
74,49,I think the problem is not that the government acts like that and the government wants to control it. The government wants to control it and to halt it. It's just that the government has a big problem with how people think.
74,50,It sounds like the government has a problem with the government and if it's not working then it can't be a problem.
74,57,I think the government needs to get to the bottom of it.
74,63,"I don't know why they said it, but I'm sure that's been the case for a while now."
74,70,"I don't think it's funny, but i like how he is a very outspoken person who does that. He's a fucking moron."
74,72,"What a joke. The hat is just a joke, the hat is the virus."
90,74,"I love the movie. A lot of people would be more excited to find it, I guess."
74,2,"If you like this movie, I think you might as well go buy a mask that will help the hives be removed."
74,18,This is how they do it.
74,33,It is not a joke. The government doesn't control the way people think. It is a problem.
74,46,I would put it on my face and I'd wear it for a while.
74,48,CANNOTANSWER FUCK YOUR HELL
74,49,"The whole '...and no one wants to talk about that oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having',"
74,50,"You don't see the problem. If you're sick, the hat is the virus."
74,57,"This is not a joke, it's a joke. The hat is just a joke, the hat is the virus. It's not funny, but i like how he is a very outspoken person who does that. He's a fucking moron. What a joke. The hat is just a joke, the hat is the virus."
74,63,I think this is a good time to talk about the government.
74,70,"Is wearing a mask an immoral, harmful thing?"
74,72,The joke hasn't been on your mind for a while. I think it's just the government. It's basically just a piece of the government. It's just a small bit of it.
90,74,I love the movie because I can see how it can make people feel better without them getting infected.
74,2,This sounds like a great joke. That's like how a real life movie sounds.
74,18,"I think it's not a joke, it's a joke."
74,33,"The hat is what will actually make you feel better when you are wearing the hat. 'I think it's a good time to talk about the government. Is wearing a mask an immoral, harmful thing?"
74,46,The guy doesn't mean that everyone likes the idea of the hat. That's ridiculous.
74,48,What is a'reckless joke'?
74,49,The government hasn't done anything about it. It's just a hammer.
74,50,They don't like to wear masks. They don't like to give them away. They don't like the idea of having a government that control the way they live. They have a problem with how they talk. They don't want to control people. And they want to control the way people think.
74,57,"It's funny, but funny because I love it."
74,63,"A lot of people would like to find the movie. A lot of people would be more excited to find it, I guess."
74,70,I don't think it's a joke.
74,72,"I'd get a mask and just wear it, a hat and a virus and a virus and a hat. Is a lot of people going to tell you what a joke it is? I can see it being fun for people to do with your face or your hat."
90,74,I love the movie. It's funny because I read it on the same internet site as the person in the movie.
74,2,"CANNOTANSWER FUCK YOUR HELL The whole '...and no one wants to talk about that', 'Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
74,18,"I think this is a very good movie. I love the movie, but I also think that it's hilarious. It's like the movie in an American English English accent."
74,33,I read about this in an interview on a real life show at a 'hollywood studio'. The guy was literally like the guy in that movie. I think he just doesn't know what a joke is and isn't quite sure what a joke is.
74,46,I see you're probably being a bit cynical but I still don't understand how this is being interpreted. You don't know why people don't like that part of the movie but it's a nice way to say it.
74,48,It doesn't make sense for me to believe that the first a tickle is actually the tickle of a virus. It makes sense if the rat bites me while I wore a mask.
74,49,"You should have said this before you bought it, yay! Having been in that movie, you already know the meaning of the word 'hammer'."
74,50,"I have heard of people who get sick from wearing a mask, because it's fun, but they're always afraid to go without them."
74,57,A lot of people would like to find the movie. A lot of people would be more excited to find it. I don't think it's a joke. I think it's just a hammer.
74,63,"You could just say, I really like your movie."
74,70,"I was in that movie too and that’s what I was told. The hat is what will actually make me feel better when I wear it, and this is a joke."
74,72,I think the hat is the joke. But a joke isn't a joke. It's a joke.
90,74,"It's pretty much just a satire of the book, but that's pretty much the entire point of the film. It's not really just about the president, but what they are trying to accomplish is to show the president how they will get it through. They are trying to make sure that their message of a system is working properly and that it can be a positive thing."
74,2,CANNOTANSWER FUCK YOUR HELL
74,18,I see you're probably being a bit cynical but I still don't understand how this is being interpreted. I see you're probably being a bit cynical but I still don't understand how this is being interpreted.
74,33,"He's a joke, he's not a joke."
74,46,I know what the heck people have to do to get to the end of this. The way it ends is a nihilism. And I don't see how any one is trying to satirize the entire movie.
74,48,It was in a satire of the book by Joe Lieberman. It was the kind of movie that I liked a lot and didn't have much of a political agenda.
74,49,CANNOTANSWER FUCK YOUR HELL
74,50,"I don't know what the joke is. if people would really like to see the movie, they should watch it."
74,57,That's very much the point of the movie - this isn't just about the president - it's about the people who are affected by the virus.
74,63,"I hate the movie because the president's face is like a picture of the president from that movie and that's probably what the movie was about. I've got no idea why but I can just see the way he's describing it, especially if the movie wasn't made in the same way."
74,70,A lot of people would like to find the movie.
74,72,The morality is very clear. And the way that is portrayed is that you're being unpopular. It's the moral reluctance of the government to do something about it. You're putting on a mask that is not safe to use and it's not the reluctance to do it. The government isn't the government. The government is the government. The whole idea that a mask is dangerous isn't a good idea. It's not the government. It's the government.
90,74,I like the movie because I can see how it can make people feel better without them getting infected.
74,2,"I'm still skeptical, but my friend's response to this is very apt, like, 'I like the movie'"
74,18,This is a great movie. I have heard of people who get sick from wearing a mask. I'm pretty sure he is just trying to get the government to stop the spread of a virus.
74,33,In general people who don't know what a joke is and don't know what a joke is are cynical idiots.
74,46,People are still trying to explain the meaning of the word hammer. Surely there are people that don't know what the word hammer means and don't understand it.
74,48,I think you are assuming it's a satire about a government that is trying to satirise people and not a movie.
74,49,CANNOTANSWER FUCK YOUR HELL ''
74,50,I think the movie is actually a satire of the book that is the same as the one in The Spectre. I think they've got good arguments for both putting in a mask and using it to stop the spread of the virus.
74,57,"Then it's not funny. Then it's a satire of a book containing all of the same bits and pieces, or it's a satire of a book based on an alleged plotline."
74,63,CANNOTANSWER FILE FUCK YOUR HELL
74,70,"I don't understand what you mean, but I don't understand what the whole idea of wearing a mask is."
74,72,I'm sorry but I didn't know it was a movie. I didn't know the whole point of the movie.
90,74,"And it sucks. The point is that people need to think they can be smarter than a cynical and self-righteous, sexist, violent, and rational, and just as a bit selfish as the people who aren't going to talk about the fact that they can't go to the doctor without a mask."
74,2,"My reaction was... ""Owl, it sucks"""
74,18,"This is a comedy, and it's a satire. But what about the government? Why isn't a satire about the government? Why does it matter?"
74,33,"The whole thing is funny, but not the joke."
74,46,"What was the point of a movie when people can wear their masks in the face? I mean, I was very sick at the time but it got me some bad news, and he said they had to give me a fucking mask - but then I got a hammer. I can tell you, in the movie, that they suck, but it's not exactly a joke or an actual joke."
74,48,"You know, the way he is talking about it isn't a joke, is it?"
74,49,It's a movie. The movie is about the government. You get sick from it.
74,50,"The whole point of the movie is that people need to think they can be smarter than a cynical and self-righteous, sexist, violent, and rational, and just as a bit selfish as the people who aren't going to talk about the fact that they can't go to the doctor without a mask."
74,57,The morality is very clear.
74,63,"No. I mean no, you have to be aware that the CDC could easily find out."
74,70,"""That movie"" is a satire of the book by Joe Lieberman, not a movie."
74,72,"I am confused, and it seems like this is a very unsettling response."
90,74,"People have told me that this isn't a satire of the book, it is a true satire of the book."
74,2,I am not saying that this movie is bad but it doesn't fit what he says. What is funny is that I can't believe that I don't know how it works.
74,18,"Yes, and yes, it is funny, but not a satire. People get sick from it."
74,33,OP: I'm sorry but I didn't know it was a movie.
74,46,Why does this movie sound satirical?
74,48,There are a few that seem to be out of line here.
74,49,It's about the government. You're sick. You're sick. That's the problem. It's about the government. People get sick from it.
74,50,"It's a movie about the CDC, not the government."
74,57,"The point of a movie is that people need to think they can be smarter than a cynical and self-righteous, sexist, violent, and rational, and just as a bit selfish as the people who aren't going to talk about the fact that they can't go to the doctor without a mask. The whole thing is funny, but not the joke. The whole thing is funny, but not the joke."
74,63,You're going to a medical class on Tuesday night. Do you have any medical advice on the subject?
74,70,I've always wondered if this was the right place to post this to reddit. I can't stand people who think this is a satire of a book. But there is a reason why I didn't like it. You get sick from it. You get sick? Not much to talk about?
74,72,The CDC wants the movie to be about the CDC and the government. I think the movie will be better than that and you won't get sick from the movie.
90,74,'Fast and Furious' is the correct word.
74,2,"You're right. '...and no one wants to talk about that', 'Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
74,18,"I am not saying that the movie is funny, but it sounds very satirical. I am just saying that he isn't going to be going to a medical class on Tuesday night. Do you have any medical advice on the subject?"
74,33,>I thought it was a movie.
74,46,The movie's not about the government. It's about the CDC.
74,48,This has nothing to do with the actual movie and not the movie itself.
74,49,What did Joe Lieberman say about a movie called Fast and Furious?
74,50,"Apparently, people want to find a movie about the government, not the government."
74,57,That's a really great way to tell it.
74,63,What is the morality of that movie?
74,70,"If you don't like it, go for the movie."
74,72,"...which is a satire of the book, not a movie?"
90,74,This is a very good example of how the Obama administration has dealt with the health care system.
74,2,"It's about the government, not the CDC. What I can't stand people who think this movie is a satire of a book."
74,18,"Yes, it's an article about the government and how it's handled, and that's what it says. If you haven't already. You can see how that's getting a lot of attention from some of the shit out there."
74,33,I think this is pretty satirical to start with.
74,46,It's been a couple of years since I've watched the movie. I've always been skeptical. It is one of those things where I get a tingling feeling and it is a very strange feeling.
74,48,- So that was my thought on it.
74,49,"I can't even recall the movie, but this was an example of a very good movie about the government, not the Obama administration."

74,70,"""The movie is a satire of the book by Joe Lieberman. But there is a reason why I didn't like it. You get sick from it. You get sick from it. Not much to talk about?"""
74,72,The movie is about a government that is actually a government. This is a very good example of how the Obama administration has dealt with the healthcare system.
90,74,That was a good movie. I liked the book and it's a great example of how the administration has dealt with the healthcare system.
74,2,It was pretty funny. I like it.

74,33,"OP's comment in response to the comments made by a bunch of ""cynical idiots"" is not really true."
74,46,Surely there are people that don't understand what the word hammer means and don't understand it.
74,48,"No. But that's the point, that is, it was actually a satire of the book."
74,49,That’s an absolute nightmare. I don’t know how anyone can tell me I’m sick from the movie. I just don’t get the real deal.
74,50,"What I can't stand is people who think this movie is pretty satirical to start with. It's not about the government, but rather how they're treated and how it's handled. The movie has a really good example of how the Obama administration has dealt with the healthcare system."
74,57,...what is the morality of the movie?
74,63,This movie has a very nice cover for the topic of the fucking rat hives. It's good.
74,70,"There's no such thing as ""I've never heard that phrase before."" And you're right - it is a joke, I can't stand it."
74,72,I'm not a doctor. This has to be a doc question. I read an article on The US Government and I have no idea what it is. It is about the federal government and the healthcare system.
90,74,"The book is a good example of how the administration has dealt with the healthcare system. I think it's best to focus on the underlying issues, not 'the ACA'."
74,2,Isn't this just another example of what an 'addiction' is?
74,18,It is not a joke. It is a joke. It is the premise of a joke.
74,33,"I would like to point out that in the 'Mixed Throats' of the article, the guy in the movie was actually a doctor whose only job is to educate people. The guy is an idiot because he's trying to get his doctors to see what a doctor is. That's what's called a ""Jail"", but a joke!"
74,46,"So you're like ""Well, I'm sure you've heard a lot about the Obama Administration before, so this is the moral basis for this movie. I'm not sure that's a good enough way to explain it."""
74,48,"'The hat is just a joke, the hat is the virus. What is the morality of the movie?"
74,49,It's more like an excuse to talk about health problems in a non-personal context.
74,50,"The film ""The Hat Is Just a Joke"" is an excellent example of how the Obama administration has dealt with the healthcare system."
74,57,"There are also some interesting examples of the medical system in the book The Virus, which is the supposedly a ""very good example"" of how the healthcare system is handled by the U.S. government, which is very much a case of it."

74,70,"I didn't like it. I got sick from it. It was sick. Not bad, but I thought I was sick and could have felt better without it. And the other way around. I liked the movie because I didn't really know what it was about. I thought it was about how a government that is actually a government did not want to deal with the issue."
74,72,"OP's comment in response to the comments made by a bunch of ""cynical idiots"" is not really true."
90,74,Are you a lawyer? Do you like to be a doctor?
74,2,I think the main issue is people who aren't familiar with the healthcare system and can't understand it. A doctor's role in a movie is to get people to know more about health problems that are not addressed by the government.
74,18,Is the movie satirical or not? Because I think it is.
74,33,People say they're sick when they're not wearing a mask.
74,46,"This movie is very bad. A lot of the questions aren't ""What was the point of the movie when people can wear their masks in the face?"""
74,48,I am sorry if I’m confusing these posts. You have a lot of points that don’t fit the context of the post. Having to leave comments that are a little contradictory with the topic that you’re trying to make.
74,49,"The entire point is i haven’t seen the movie, but I don’t see that."
74,50,"I love the book, The Spectre and I can't believe the hives and how it reminds me of The Virus."
74,57,I'm gonna start with the fact that I like the movie because it's not a joke.
74,63,This sounds like a pretty easy way to come up with a solution to a problem. It's really all about the people.
74,70,"The fact that a lot of people on this sub are saying, ""Oh I don't like it! You get sick from it!"" and ""I don't know what the joke is."", and that's about it."
74,72,I feel like the joke is not so much that it doesn't even fit the topic.
90,74,"A prank is a prank, and the whole thing is a prank based on a book by the Obama administration."
74,2,"""I am not going to 'get sick of it,' it's a bad joke."
74,18,"I don't know why you're being a bit cynical. I think the joke is not an easy way to come up with a solution to a problem. A prank is a prank, and the whole thing is a prank based on a book by the Obama administration."
74,33,"i can tell you're saying i liked the movie, i think i don't understand the hat thing"
74,46,"I was just pointing out that ""the only person who would want to make fun of a hat is the people who make fun of them, or even just a friend,"" is a cynical, sarcastic, inconsiderate term that I have a good idea for, is the people who will tell people they don't like the hat, ""I don't understand what it means and don't understand it."""
74,48,"A lot of the people in this sub are saying, ""Oh, I don't like it! You get sick from it! Do you think I don't think it's a prank?"""
74,49,OP says the movie is about the government and not the people that want to take care of it. And this whole situation is a joke and the reason the government is trying to control it is because of the people that are sick and are not familiar with the medical system.
74,50,The movie is about the American Medical Association and some people get sick from a mask alot.
74,57,"> The hat is just a joke, the hat is the virus. What is the morality of the movie? It's more like an excuse to talk about health problems in a non-personal context."
74,63,"If a virus spreads, you can't simply walk away, or be sick, without a mask, or a bodyguard. You can still get sick, but they can't. That's why I think it's a good time to talk about the government."
74,70,... And I don't know what the joke is about. I don't know what it's about.
74,72,I don't know what you're referring to. There's just no point in having to be a doctor to get people sick and not know about a thing. This is the moral issue. It's not a joke. It's about the government and the healthcare system. The hat is just a joke.
90,74,"OP. The article is written by a Democrat and his brother who says that he has the ACA, he's not going to use it. They're gonna make an election based on him, which is kind of sad. The article also says that he won't use a mask and won't support his father's bill, which is very blatant."
74,2,"I read the book about this with a lot of questions in it, but I didn't get it."
74,18,I’m not even sure what you mean. You’re an idiot. I’m just being a bit cynical. You’re saying “it’s a joke.... But what about the government” and it’s been abused. That’s the joke. I don’t know what the fuck this is.
74,33,No pranking. They are making jokes.
74,46,There are lots of other things I could tell you but I'm not really a fan of the hat. It's about the US government and the government.
74,48,What's the moral of wearing a hat in the film?
74,49,"It's the problem that the whole movie is about and you're sick, but not the medical system. This is a big problem. The government has a big problem with how people think, which is why it's about the people. The movie is about the government and not the people that want to take care of it."
74,50,"""Pretty much everything i said is a satire."""
74,57,"I'm gonna go look it up. I think the hat is the joke. And I really am. I like the movie. I think it's funny, but not funny. It's not funny. It's not funny. I like the movie because it's not a joke. The hat is just a joke, the hat is the virus. This is about the government and the healthcare system. This is a problem. A prank is a prank. A prank is the problem, not the reason why it's about the government."

74,33,"It's the biggest, biggest, biggest prank about the government in the history of the United States. It's not that bad. The hat is a joke about the government. It's not just the healthcare system. The hat is the moral problem of the United States."
74,46,"The first sentence of the article isn't really a prank, but it's what the story tells us. It's about the government's efforts to stop the spread of a disease, not the health system, and is a prank. This movie is not about the hat, but the health care system."
74,48,"I know a lot of people who don't get how the movie is about the government. What I'm telling you is that it's a prank about the government, not about the people that want to take care of it."
74,49,“We want to stop spreading a virus.”
74,50,"What the guy in the article is trying to say is that the movie is about the government and the healthcare system. What is the moral of this movie? It's not about the government, but the healthcare system. This is a problem."
74,57,It's all about the hat. It's about the hat. This is the movie.
74,63,It is a joke about the government and not about the healthcare system. The movie is about the government.
74,70,"I have a friend who is going through a similar experience. He wore a mask a few years ago and was never in that movie so he said that he was a fan of the movie. When he said he was in it he said it was the only way to get him to wear it. He said he didn't want it, and that it was about the government and his health, not about the government. It was a very nice day for him."
74,72,"If you're in the US, get a new hat. You will never be sick. You won't be sick."

74,49,That movie was a joke.
74,50,"I read an article on the Internet that explains that Obamacare in many places, and that the hat is supposed to be a joke, but that's the problem of the hat. So there is the problem of Obamacare in other countries."

I can also tell you a little bit about the people who like the movie. If the movie wasn't funny it would have been a great way to break a record for the time.
74,70,i like it. the hat is what will actually make me feel better when i wear it. i don't like the idea of it. it's a joke because it's a joke.
74,72,It isn't a joke. It's a joke. And the joke isn't so bad as it isn't a good joke. The whole idea that the hat is dangerous isn't a good idea. It's just a joke.
90,74,"So, this movie is about the government and not the health care system?"
74,2,The hat is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
74,18,It's the hat. This is just one of the many ways to joke.

74,49,I can't believe people are having this conversation over the phone.
74,50,They're not a joke.
74,57,"I don't know what to say, but the story has a few points in it."
74,63,There are many stories about people wearing masks in the medical field and the CDC has been unable to help them for decades. The only thing they are able to help with is the disease which is very rare. There is a lot of myth in the world about people not wearing masks because they grew up with that virus. They also do not have a medical facility that helps them as they were forced to do it because they didn't want to risk it.
74,70,"I like the movie, but I don't think that's the joke"
74,72,"In a few lines, in the middle of an obscenely long article about how the CDC used a mask, the joke became. The hat is actually a joke."
90,74,"It is not just about the ACA. It's about how to stop the spread of disease without affecting people's lives. I love the movie because I can see how it can help people without being infected and the fact that I can't even get to see it without a mask is an issue. People don't like to talk about the ACA, but the fact that it is about the government, is ridiculous."
74,2,"""The hat is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."""
74,18,The article is in an English accent.
74,33,"So you're like ""I don't want to be a joke to you but you want to be an idiot to me"" and not ""I don't want to be an idiot"" and you like this movie?"
74,46,"There is no truth in it. I know that I could be joking, but it would be better for the hat. It doesn't make it any less of a joke."
74,48,...but that's not the point.
74,49,"... The movie is about the government, but not the healthcare system."
74,50,"The government is supposed to prevent and combat the spread of the virus. A lot of people get sick from wearing a mask, because people are sick from the disease. The hat is meant to help people. It is a joke."
74,57,You're right that this isn't a prank.
74,63,">In an open letter, it says ""I love the movie. I can also tell you a little bit about the people who like the movie. I'm actually going to watch it tonight. I think I've just learned about this whole stuff from the books a while ago."
74,70,Having a very specific type of face is not the same as having a facial expression (the face of the person I am describing) and it's not a joke at all. It is a joke because it's an idea.
74,72,Aside from this I just wanted to point out that the CDC is the one that put together this movie and that it will be about the government and the healthcare system.

74,48,"Its about the government, not the ACA. It's about how people think."
74,49,"So basically, what's the point of the prank?"
74,50,I think we can all agree that it's not about the government or the healthcare system.
74,57,"I don't think it's funny. I'm more interested in the joke. And to me, the hat doesn't make it funny, but that's why I like the movie."
74,63,I'd tell them this isn't a movie.
74,70,"This is the stuff where a hat doesn't sound funny and the ""happiness"" is irrelevant. It makes sense."

If you're looking for something that says the hat, that's it."
