101,7,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
7,4,"I was a public health officer for the University of Georgia, at the time of this post."
9,7,It's called a scar and it is part of a virus. The doctors don't put the mask on and there's no way to know how it will spread.
12,7,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
16,7,Wearing a mask or getting the fucked out of a mask is a terribly unpopular policy amongst Americans.
17,7,"I just want to see a picture of the woman who wore a mask to protect herself, because that's pretty disgusting."

23,7,What is the best way to stop the spread of the virus. Please wear a mask.
35,7,"I was also wearing a mask in the summer while visiting a friend who went to his cousins, and his friend said they did not feel safe or comforting when they were wearing their masks. It was hard to understand and not very fun, but that was the point of my trip."
40,7,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
59,7,I don't think we should be allowed to wear the mask.
65,7,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
67,7,"Is a mask an expensive way to go? I don't think you should buy one because of a safety issue. I would be too if I had a mask, but I would hardly recommend it to a sick person with an infection."
70,7,I'm afraid a virulent virus can be spread on your skin. I'm sure it's very virulent and there are some things you don't know. Isn't it possible to contract it easily in your car?
95,7,"It was supposed to help in preventing a virus. The gun worked in the background, a floppy disk, that could be used to burn a dead person into a floppy disk. Then the person had to carry it, and the gun had to be put back in, which is a great way to stop the spread of a virus."
101,7,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
7,4,"I don't know how he is a bad person, but he is probably the most vocal, ignorant, gullible, submissive, and gullible person in Georgia and he ain't the only one in the country to have a mask on."
9,7,I like the first one. It's one of the dumbest things things I've ever done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things I am going to go to Washington DC on Tuesday to see if the CDC can 't keep you from using any of the vaccines to make you sick? A man a man of my word covid.
12,7,So they say they are using the mask to prevent the spread of the virus.
16,7,"I think you need to think a little about your state's recent immigration laws. As you may have heard, it is actually a state issue."
17,7,It is in the antivirus campaign that Donald Trump wants to stop.
19,7,"A few things: The president is supposed to have a role in changing the law. Unless he is going to be acting in public and having a big event, he can have his ass covered and he can wear a mask to be sure. If the president is wearing a mask and not covering his ass, he has a role."
23,7,This is the first thing that comes to mind in a lot of contexts.
35,7,"I'm sorry he didn't vote against it, what is the state bringing to the debate."
40,7,A phd? It's a degree.
59,7,"I was going to say the same thing, because I'm in the public health department at a local public health department."
65,7,"This is what people are supposed to believe, that the only way to stop a virus is through a vaccination vaccine, because it's dangerous?"
67,7,There are lots of government mandates:
70,7,You are being a troll. You can't help but think about the troll.
95,7,The guy with the mask is wearing the mask in his life.
101,7,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
7,4,"I was a public health officer at the University of Georgia, at the time of this post."
9,7,I know right? They want to ban a mask. But they have to be able to tell you what they can do?
12,7,There is an interesting fact I read recently in r/drugcontrol. It was not just people who said the newest strain is soooooo contagious just because they have a mask on their hands pics don't mean they re using it. It was people who said the vaccine is not effective and they are now worried about it. That is why he did not wear a mask.
16,7,I think it's a good thing the OP was doing his own research.
17,7,"Its a dickish idea, especially because if it were us, if it was the government. And we'd probably still have the worst government policies we've ever had."
19,7,"He said in his last statement that he can wear a mask as he sees fit, because he wants to, so it's kind of unfair and disrespectful to have this rule enforced for a while."
23,7,IANAL. But this isn't something I would do at home.
35,7,"In this context, the issue is not what OP is wearing."
40,7,"It seems like a lot of people are joking, because it's an important reason why some people are more willing to accept it."
59,7,This is what I always heard on news headlines.
65,7,They could go on vacation with the CDC to visit someone else in the family. It was an amazing thing they could do to a friend - and it was a good investment for us and the school he went to. The school had been very cooperative about this. There is no such thing as'shock' in a public health department that could have prevented a public health emergency because of it.
67,7,"I am not a scientist and I can't read, and can't 'know' what 'Is a mask part of the measures deployed by the government' is."
70,7,"It is also an issue with the government and the health care system in general. I've seen this with a group of friends recently, including one of the parents of a young woman who has a hard time breathing a virus in her car."
95,7,It's pretty funny that this isn't in the book but it does not seem like the movie really exists.
101,7,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
7,4,Probably a good reason for people who think it's the best way to stop the spread of a virus.
9,7,'Is a mask mandatory in Georgia? Is it a requirement in the states? I know right? I know right? They want to ban a mask. But they have to be able to tell you what they can do?'
12,7,[NAME] and [NAME] are the only two people who are not able to take responsibility for AIDS.
16,7,[NAME] was born in the US and he used to work in the Army.
17,7,I have to be honest. This seems to be a lot of common courtesy on my part. You should definitely look up the film Rogs of the Past. It's one of the best ones I have ever seen.
19,7,This is one of the things you need to see and understand.
23,7,>My mom always had a good vaccination.
35,7,They are trying to make sure we can do a public health education and get that out. So I'm going to ask him if he's willing to do that? I'm a citizen so I'm curious.
40,7,It's a pretty good explanation that he does it for the purpose of protection. I'd rather use it on myself than to do something like this.
59,7,"My guess is that because you're an Australian, you didn't learn that ""Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I'm not sure if it's a nitpick, but when you take the right thing and the wrong thing, that doesn't change the fact that the government wants to help. So OOC says that wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
65,7,"What's the worst part about being able to ah, go out and do something good if you think there's a good chance of the CDC putting you at risk? It's a medical malpractice and it's very much a health care policy, it is not a health care policy."
67,7,"I think they have a good reason to continue using them. I mean, they don't want to cut any losses by providing a safety precaution, they want to make sure you get a mask because that's what they want you to wear."
70,7,"The video that gets posted is about this movie. I feel like it's over a jingle. If you want to find out more, please share."
95,7,"This movie was hilarious. I think the movie is one of the best movies in the book, but I don't care what he was telling us. It's called an ""advice"" when it comes to protecting yourself from a virus."
101,7,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
7,4,"That's some sort of mythical belief. It's a very common belief for many people and for the CDC. There are some very stupid people in the country, some really unmotivated."
9,7,"I'm a federal official in Washington and a cop jumped the gun and took his kids to the hospital, but I'm not a physician. I can't get the CDC to ban me from wearing a mask for years."
12,7,"If they say the ""false"" in the title, I think that it means people can't actually get them into a contract and get it through a doctor."
16,7,I think you are missing a big point here. They are not using it as a defense mechanism. They are only using it to protect people against the spread of viruses.
17,7,"Well, it has got to be something. That's what the US Department of Health does, I suppose."
19,7,"This is the first time I've been a doctor for a while, and you seem to be a genuinely interesting person, right?"
23,7,"It is a joke about the ACA which is not in effect. It's intended to protect against some form of HIV/AIDS. Is a mask mandatory in Georgia? It is a requirement in the states. I'm not a conservative, but this is the kind of thing I would do to defend the ACA."
35,7,">I'm sorry he didn't vote against it, what is the state bringing to the debate."
40,7,">I'm so glad you have a new favorite team. And I hope this happens, because if you want your players to be able to play a PG in the NFC South and win their first national championship with an unavoidable loss then you must be a better coach Using a mask is not a joke. It's a pretty good explanation that he does it for the purpose of protection."
59,7,"I'm a huge fan of the anti-virus movement, but this sub is not in line with how the ACA has been applied in the USA."
65,7,CANNOTANSWER: Is there a special case where a medical emergency is involving a student undergoing a procedure or even having to do it?
67,7,"They are trying to elicit more violence in our society, and it is clearly not legal for them to do so."
70,7,"I don't really understand the joke, I just like the way people are interpreting it. It was not funny. I just don't see how people will see it as a prank, but it would have been really funny if it wasn't a joke and didn't even need to be said. This is the exact reason why they have this attitude."
95,7,"OP, it is a great book!"
101,7,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
7,4,"I'm sorry, but I was not a physician, and I cannot speak to the CDC directly. Is it even in law?"
9,7,I've been using this for years now. You need to stop using these types of things.
12,7,"Yes, but you're going to have to put the mask on. It's not a mask. It's a mask."
16,7,Those are the kind of fads people who want to get away with it.
17,7,...that's what the government does.
19,7,"I think that is one of the biggest questions you have to ask yourself before going to the doctor. If he doesn't want to, he's a tyrant."
23,7,"Almost all the facts from a joke are true. ""If you don't wear a mask in public, you should do so. The government can't force people to do what they want."""
35,7,"I can understand why people are arguing, but the actual issue here is not a ""main issue."" The ACA and the government are doing a pretty awful job of preventing the spread of the virus. I think the ACA is a good idea because it works. It's not a thing of the past."
40,7,"A little misunderstanding of what this is, if you think that is right you should just ignore it."
59,7,I think the article is a little misleading. The guy was trying to cover up a joke about the government.
65,7,"[Roughly half of the states have a policy allowing kids to wear a mask, despite being at the age of 18]."
67,7,"Is it safe to wear a mask or get the jab? Because yes, it's a safety precaution."
70,7,"I have seen this movie with a group of friends recently, including one of the parents of a young woman who has a hard time breathing a virus in her car."","
95,7,"You guys are absolutely right. I think you guys are right that this movie is a great book, but I think you should definitely watch it again."
101,7,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
7,4,People do not realize the truth. Those are the ones who are using it.
9,7,Vaccines aren't the right thing to do.
12,7,He is actually using the mask to prevent the spread of the virus.
16,7,"It is only necessary to wear a mask, not to have it on."
17,7,"If the man does not understand that his role in the NSA's attack on AIDS is the only real reason he wants to be a part of it, the man i am referring to probably has a good idea. The CDC isn't saying he's not a bad guy for not acting up."
19,7,"I don't think that a politician is a tyrant, but it's a serious issue. It's part of the job of the NSA."
23,7,The president is a tyrant who wants to get rid of any form of health care. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of a virus. Please wear masks.
35,7,I'm sure if the CDC weren't working against the CDC they would have been better off as a dick than the CIA. There is a whole subreddit dedicated to this topic and it's about the idea that wearing a mask in public is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
40,7,"If he is a CDC official, this probably should be a big deal. Using a mask makes his breathing worse, as does using a mask if the CDC is not. This is part of the means used by the government to stop the spread of viruses. Wearing a mask outside or in your car alone is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
59,7,So your opinion has nothing to do with the ACA?
65,7,"I think that is pretty amazing. But what isn't hilarious is that in our society we can't have a specific type of treatment for a disease that isn't easily available to us, that's what we want to have. In our society we're forced to choose the kind of treatment we want, and in this country we need those who have the right to care for ourselves."
67,7,A lot of the government mandates say that the government doesn't like to let people have their own healthcare.
70,7,A prank with a jingle is not just a prank. It's not a joke. It's the simplest way to get a jingle... or even a joke. It's a prank.
95,7,"I also enjoy watching movies. I've always wanted to see this movie as a means to prevent the spread of a virus, and it's one of my favorites."
101,7,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
7,4,"He threw a prank on the president, not the CIA."
9,7,"The story's not a joke, but a bit more of a satire, in my opinion."
12,7,> I see no problem with having a mask on and not knowing what to say in case people start getting sick. I do have a mask on that tells me that this is very blatantly against the rules and that is the reason to wear one
16,7,"This is one of the most misunderstood comments I've ever read. It's like an unpopular opinion. It's like saying: “We don't care because we do, we just need to cut down on our burdens” is like saying: ‘It's a joke to think about the government and to think about your own position and the government.’"
17,7,"In other news, there is a virus that is in the united states. It is the CDC's job to try and prevent it from happening."
19,7,"People in the US still wear masks. It's not a joke. The president is responsible for that. People need to know about what he's doing, not about what he's doing."
23,7,CANNOTANSWER (NAME) in the NSA's National Center on Disease Control
35,7,I know you are confused. But this seems pretty straight forward. The government and the CDC are doing a pretty awful job of preventing the spread of a virus. The government and the CDC are doing a pretty awful job of preventing the spread of a virus.
40,7,There is an argument about not putting a mask on because of how it's used to prevent HIV from spreading. The NSA is a good one but not the best at it.
59,7,"i don't know if the article is misleading, it's a joke."
65,7,"It's so bad, but I can understand why this is funny."
67,7,"I am not opposed to them, but I believe the right to health care is needed."
70,7,i like the way people interpret it. it's a joke
95,7,"As in, the movie he portrayed is a better movie."
101,7,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
7,4,Wearing a mask helps in stopping the spread of a virus. The joke is still hilarious.
9,7,I don't think the CDC has any idea what a virus is. The whole 'I'm wearing a mask thing' thing is very much a satire.
12,7,So you're saying the president is using the mask to stop the spread of a virus.
16,7,"The NSA is actually attempting to stifle the spread of AIDS. It doesn't seem like they have any information or resources to do anything about it, so they won't get involved with preventing it."
17,7,"It's not a joke, it's just a funny story."
19,7,"This isn't a joke, it's a real issue. The government is trying to stop the spread of AIDS."
23,7,"I would wear a mask, you know, to avoid the effects of HIV/AIDS."
35,7,You are absolutely right. I think the CDC is not doing any good.
40,7,The NSA. We don't know who actually made that joke.
59,7,"The NSA, citing a fake wikipedia article about it, isn't trying to change what they've seen on TV."
65,7,"A family member and his family, in turn, all wear a mask when the person is at risk for illness or disability. The problem is, they have different reasons, not because they need it, but because they don't need it. A friend has a mask and she wears it because she's sick and needs treatment, because she can't get a virus from her own body, because her family can't."
67,7,"So a man who wants to buy a mask to cut down on the health care costs and reduce the incidence of AIDS can get infected in the future, and that the government isn't getting rid of any form of health care? I can't imagine you being in a situation where you can't afford the healthcare."
70,7,I'm gonna start with the comments.
95,7,I think he was just being facetious. You are the most important factor in making the movie better.
101,7,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
7,4,I don't think the CDC has any information or resources to do anything about it.
9,7,There are 2 sides to this.
12,7,">Hey, I think that's a joke. I thought that's a joke. I thought that's a joke. I thought that's a joke. I thought that's a joke. I thought that's a joke."
16,7,"It's like saying: ""We don't care because we do, we just need to cut down on our burdens"""
17,7,"If this is a joke, it's really a joke."
19,7,It's a big one if you ask me.
23,7,"I think I'll go by the CDC name. They're a really good agency, but I think it's quite a bit different."
35,7,The government is doing a pretty awful job of preventing the spread of a virus. The government and the CDC are doing a pretty awful job of preventing the spread of a virus.
40,7,"This is a real issue, and I think you're missing some important points."
59,7,Obviously I'm not the only one.
65,7,I think you're reading a very interesting article with some good insights.
67,7,> 'There are lots of government mandates:'
70,7,"I love reading the prank pranks. Having a prank with a jingle is like going out with friends, and the prank is fun."
95,7,That's a good point.
101,7,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
7,4,"You're right, it's a big problem."
9,7,"I'm gonna go out on a limb here, and say this:"
12,7,"Unless you are actually in the UK, I do not see a lot of people in the United States having that problem."
16,7,"So your friend is saying ""What's up with the NSA and why isn't the government using AIDS protection? Trying to stop HIV. I'm not saying it's bad, it's bad."""
17,7,"This is probably the most tame thing you've read. It's an article I've read, I don't even know it's an actual story and I'm not sure if you're a Republican or not."
19,7,"If you go to a doctor, tell them you're scared."
23,7,"""The ACA is not about public health and prevents the spread of viruses. Its a prank called ""the health of our country."" There are things we can do to prevent it and it is part of the health care system."""
35,7,The ACA isn't a thing of the past.
40,7,i agree that the guy is a hater
59,7,I think the guy is trying to make a joke.
65,7,"It would be stupid to do it so quickly, because people in the US would not want to be forced to care for themselves."
67,7,That's a good question.
70,7,"""A prank with a jingle is not just a prank. It's the simplest way to get a jingle... or even a joke. It's a joke. It's the simplest way to get a jingle... or even a joke. It's funny. I don't really understand the joke, I just like the way people interpret it. It's not funny. It's the simplest way to get a jingle."
95,7,"This is a lot like the movie. The movie is fun, but it's the same story. The first time I saw it, it sounded like a good one. Honestly it's just not my favorite."
101,7,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
7,4,"The article doesn't say it's a big problem. It states that ""This is not a prank but is a prank."""
9,7,"I don't even think it's a joke, just that it's an extremely inappropriate use of humor."
12,7,I'm gonna take a look at this video. I'm not sure how it will pan out.
16,7,"This is like saying: “I don’t care because we do, we just need to cut down on our burdens.” This is like saying: “we don’t care because we do, we just need to cut down on our burdens”"
17,7,This is a joke. It’s not like a joke is what’s on the front page of the news.
19,7,He's in the wrong place. He was a joke.
23,7,"The joke is not a joke. The joke is a joke, and the president is not against it."
35,7,I'm so tired of hearing the name of this one-two punch line...
40,7,"In the movie, they say ""Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
59,7,"It's a joke, it's not."
65,7,"It's hilarious. But despite what we've seen from all over the world, it's so sad that we can't have a specific type of treatment that isn't easily available to us, that's what we want."
67,7,"""The ACA isn't helping AIDS, and the president is trying to destroy the American people - and is going to kill us."""
70,7,"The NSA and NSA have done a lot of things to make their actions as a business, but they didn't do anything for the whole community. The NSA is a very large, very organized organization that wants to take care of its citizens and take care of those they have to do that, in spite of how many good people they are. It's an important, well-written statement, that the media, academia, and government agencies have to be responsible for the behavior that causes it."
95,7,This guy is just so stupid.
101,7,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
7,4,"It's funny. I'm not sure I'd want to be like, ""Well, it's fun to get to know the people that think they're good. I don't think there's a way to stop the virus"" 'He's in the wrong place, because I don't think I'm going to take a look at this video. I'm not sure how it's going to pan out."
9,7,...I can't even think of any other person who would not be able to do that. I'm a shambles asshole.
12,7,I think that this article is a bit misleading. He is being censored by the media and is a prank. He is being a Democrat and a Republican.
16,7,Vaccines are not a problem for the United States. They are not going to change as quickly as the CDC is trying. They are talking about the federal government in order to get HIV patients in a hospital or other facility. I don't see any way in hell that they do so without being told otherwise.
17,7,It sounds like someone had to make a joke about the CDC because of it.
19,7,"It’s a prank, but people in this country are just so much worse off."
23,7,People are not going to tolerate it. It's the right thing to do. I don't think people will notice you.
35,7,"No, this is a sarcastic argument. It's a joke."
40,7,What are the main points of the movie?
59,7,"Vaccines are not the right, and they should not have to do it. The fact that you can't find a doctor in time for work, and you don't have to visit the doctor is irrelevant."
65,7,"It's a funny rant, but I can understand why you're being a bit crazy. What is the difference between ""using a mask"" to prevent AIDS and ""fake"" evidence?"
67,7,CANNOTANSWER:
70,7,"I'm not going to disagree with you. The ACA seems like a perfect fit, I feel like you're just describing how they look in a few of the other movies."
95,7,>I want to get a mask for a girl and I want to wear it on her.
101,7,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
7,4,I don't think the CDC has any information to do anything about it.
9,7,"What's that? The CDC is a shambles, not a nutjob. I would be so empathetic to the government that if it's not something they are willing to put forth, I'd get in trouble for it."
12,7,A great example of the health care system is a good movie about the ACA.
16,7,I think that there are a few things going on here:
17,7,"I just wanted to point out that the CDC is not a part of the health care system. You're in a country that is spoiled, full of nonsense."
19,7,"I think the president should re-think his role in the health care system. He's not trying to make a prank on me, he's trying to make a joke."
23,7,A troll trying to make a joke of that. He was using the CDC name as a joke he was using to defend the ACA. But he doesn't do anything wrong.
35,7,The only reason they're doing anything is because the NSA and the CDC don't have a mandate to stop it from happening. And the ACA and CDC should be doing nothing to stop it.
40,7,"As a CDC official and not a CDC official, I don't see the point of making a joke."
59,7,">Waying a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.Well... I know the name of this subreddit is a lot of stuff, and I'm pretty sure this is what it says :("
65,7,"Because the issue is not in your name - it is a joke, and it will never be an issue."
67,7,This is a funny movie.
70,7,"I can relate to this but I really feel that a prank that made people laugh was just a joke and it's more a joke than a prank. I do like the jingle, but the fact that it's so good doesn't mean it's a joke. I don't know what other comments have to do with the ACA, but it's funny and the jingle is what I like the most. I would definitely suggest RA see it."
95,7,"What are you thinking here? I just want to say that a bit more, but I really don't think I've ever seen any of these. I've seen the pranks that they're funny."
101,7,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
7,4,Is there anything you want to be able to do?
9,7,"It sounds like a movie. It is based on the fact that it's a joke. It doesn't make sense. It's a joke. It's a joke. The President's role is to keep people safe and to give people a voice. You don't owe anyone anything, because you're going to get in trouble for doing so."
12,7,Why is the President not giving people the right to wear a mask? Is there a lot of information out there that makes it sound like this guy was an NSA agent?
16,7,>This is a really big problem.
17,7,"It's a joke, because it's not a joke."
19,7,The movie is about a doctor trying to prevent HIV infection. The problem with a mask is that people don't know how to walk because they think it's bad. Putting on a mask doesn't make it a bad joke.
23,7,"That prank is the one that is going to hurt everyone, and is not what he wants people to do."
35,7,>Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.>
40,7,There is a lot of nonsense going on here. I'm not an expert on the CDC. But I do know the CDC is not a part of the ACA.
59,7,I'm really looking forward to the day I can stop using the hospital's ineptness as a mask.
65,7,"It's not really a joke. It's an outrageous way of saying ""I'm not concerned about my genitals and the risks associated with AIDS. The problem is that it's not in your name - it is a joke, and it will never be an issue."""
67,7,Those things are snarky. They seem a bit too complicated.
70,7,"I would definitely suggest RA see it....I don't know whether to support the repeal of health care or not, but to say that you believe the president is an opportunistic dictator is the wrong stance."
95,7,I've been in the pranks and now I know why they're funny.
101,7,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
7,4,"I don't think I've seen any of these. But I do know that the ACA is a joke, but a lot of people aren't really aware of it. This movie is about a doctor trying to prevent HIV infection. The problem with a mask is that people don't know how to walk because they think it's bad. Putting on a mask doesn't make it a joke, and it will never be an issue. This is a movie, but I do know that it is a joke, but the joke is more of a joke"
9,7,"I don't think it is a joke, that it is a joke."
12,7,>People wear masks to stop people from being able to walk like that if it is a joke.
16,7,"A LOT of people are misinterpreting the article, and it's like saying ""This is the truth."""
17,7,...I think it's funny.
19,7,This is all about the syringe. I like to put on a mask to make sure.
23,7,What the CDC is doing to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS is not the same as an ACA joke?
35,7,"I'm not sure what the actual ACA and the CDC do, but the CDC is doing a pretty awful job of preventing the spread of a virus. The ACA isn't a joke, the CDC is doing a pretty awful job of preventing the spread of a virus."
40,7,I think the ACA isn't a joke. It's a joke.
59,7,"It is a satire, not an ethical breach of health."
65,7,What is the issue? Why does this not seem like a joke?
67,7,The ACA is a part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
70,7,It's just this one sentence that came to my head.

101,7,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
7,4,What a stupid comment. I think it was the right thing to do here.
9,7,"It's a joke - if you want to change your attitude, just go with what you want."
12,7,"The fact that he was talking about a virus, he does not know how to talk about it. He has no idea what is going on. The whole point of this movie is he just doesn't get it. I'm really sorry to say he's been so clingy with the Obama administration for the past 8 years."
16,7,"""I think you need to think a little about your state's recent immigration laws."
17,7,"This was the first time I've heard someone say that - and I haven't thought of the second either, but still, I'm sure the CDC is a very good party."
19,7,Why would people in public not wear a mask? I'm a cop who had a virus.
23,7,"I am a doctor, so I am not the cheapest. I feel like I can have a very high quality vaccination for sure, but I cannot get into a group of people that need my assistance unless I have a bad diagnosis. Hopefully the vaccinated person isn't going to die soon!"
35,7,The government is not doing a good job. It is working to prevent the spread of viruses.
40,7,The ACA is part of a conspiracy to be a troll....and I think that the ACA is a joke.
59,7,"You are not a satire, you are not an ethical breach of health. It is a joke."
65,7,It was a joke. The CDC has some pretty nice news.
67,7,"I think you could just go and see the video, you could also listen to it, it's free to all."
70,7,"I'd also say ""It's not a joke"" if you ask me."
95,7,I've been in a couple of pranks that I enjoy and it made me laugh. You can go to the video and see what the character is like and it makes you laugh.
101,7,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
7,4,Getting vaccinated with a mask is the best way to fight this terrible AIDS.
9,7,"They will ban you from wearing it in the future, the president's role is to provide safe, effective health care and the government is to control what happens to the children who get sick."
12,7,I'm glad you guys have a great life. It's really good that we have a government that is able to protect ourselves. Those people are the ones who need to be vaccinated - they are the ones who have to be vaccinated for AIDS and they are the ones who should not be vaccinated because of AIDS. Vaccines are not a crime. They aren't allowed to have a health insurance policy that protects them from the illness.
16,7,I'm sorry but the people who were making those comments are insensitive and apprehensive.
17,7,"This isn't a joke, it's a story, and it's not the truth."
19,7,I don't think you understand the meaning of pranks.
23,7,"The CDC is in the process of banning it. And they are using a mask that is ineffective, that if people don't wear it, they are going to have to veto it."
35,7,The ACA hasn't started yet. I think we'll see a little more of it here. I'd like to read a few more - I'll be able to help you out if you are interested.
40,7,The ACA is a joke about it and I'm not sure if it has any actual substance or effect unless someone has made a joke about it.
59,7,"I like the ""I don't think we should be allowed to wear the mask."" ad."
65,7,"CANNOTANSWER'S NOTE: I'm not a doctor but my DH is a doctor. If I get a sick person to wear a mask, I do not get a vaccine. In addition to my being vaccinated, I don't think a doctor can give me a vaccine for a sick person. I do not believe that the CDC can give a treatment to the sick. I have no idea how the CDC can get a treatment, it's like the government's responsibility to prevent it. It's not really "
67,7,The article and some of the comments that are listed are a bit misleading.
70,7,"I'm sure the comments here are correct if they're not referring to the ACA or not. I'm not pointing out the point of the post, but it's important that people understand the ACA and the healthcare system, not just the NSA, who is responsible for health care."
95,7,"I think the point of a prank is that it's a prank, not a prank. Isn't that why it's funny? It's funny because it's something that it's fun to do but not fun. It's about how you can't help a problem with something that is too simple to solve."
101,7,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
7,4,It's still a joke.
9,7,I think the jokes that the author is making are narcissistic.
12,7,People don't wear a mask to prevent people from getting sick. They wear a mask to prevent the spread of AIDS.
16,7,"It’s not just about 'The President of the United States', it’s about the President of the United States of America."
17,7,"I'd just like to point out that even if it were the CDC I would not be able to be a troll for not being involved in the ACA, if they were, I would be able to be involved with an anti-vaccination campaign, if that's what a joke is based on."
19,7,> The CDC and CDC have a few different 'assumptions':
23,7,It's not a joke. 'The president is a tyrant who wants to get rid of any form of health care. Please wear a mask' is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
35,7,"'Wearing a mask in public is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."""
40,7,"You know I would say that while the ACA is a joke, it is not a joke. I am not sure if it is a joke, but I think a lot of people are joking."
59,7,"I don't think he is trying to make a joke, because he doesn't believe in health. He just wants to show people he thinks health is important and they are trying to use it as a political tool."
65,7,"I am a doctor, so I am a doctor. The CDC has a huge program for this sort of stuff. The school had a very good student who got the CDC to provide treatment for an infectious disease, but it's very much a joke, which is why I hate people that don't believe it."
67,7,"Because they 'elicit more violence in our society, and it is clearly not legal for them to do so.'"
70,7,I don't care if you see the movies or not. This is not a joke at all. A joke is a joke. The joke is not just a joke. It is more of a joke than a joke.
95,7,"I mean, I read the books and it makes sense - I can't really find it sexy in them."
101,7,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
7,4,"I want to say that I don't think a lot of people are joking. It is a joke because the CDC, and the President, are both narcissists who wish to spread the ACA. But a joke that is a joke, is still funny."
9,7,I'm not trying to be rude. This is not a joke. This is the only reason I would be going to see a doctor. The only reason a doctor can't help you is if you get in the house.
12,7,i think a lot of Americans would like to see a movie about a prank or a movie about the ACA.
16,7,"I don't see how a joke would have to be in reference to something that's actually funny, because there is actually a joke that the government is trying to get rid of HIV/AIDS."
17,7,You can find the story on here by clicking on the title. It's interesting. I like your response because it sounds funny but I have to be honest. This is a really good story.
19,7,"Apparently the people of the United States have a lot to answer for. I have never gotten to the point where they don't really know why a prank is a joke, and this is a prank, but I think they are making a pretty good case that it's a joke, and not something to be upset about."
23,7,"The CDC was pretty bad, it was one of the few agencies that tried to stop it."
35,7,"I'd tell him this and say if he's not already, it's just that his body was damaged. But he seems to want to keep bringing it up and vaccinating him in the face with him. So when he said he wanted a mask because he hasn't tried it, why is he wearing it? That's a really good joke."
40,7,I wouldn't call the ACA a prank. Just because you're a fan doesn't mean you're being funny.
59,7,>[The CDC and the CDC are the ones who make the best use of this word. The reason why CDC doesn't bother is because it is a very old joke. What do you think is the real problem with these people?
65,7,I have no idea how they got the CDC to provide treatment for AIDS.
67,7,It's a good thing the government is trying to stop this from happening again.
70,7,It doesn't matter what the joke is. It's funny.
95,7,"I'm not being sarcastic. This is a prank. I've had many pranks. I think it's fun, and I think it's hilarious."
101,7,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
7,4,"I'm not sure if you can understand why this is a joke. It's not like a good joke, is it?"
9,7,"You know, if you read the book if you don't think people would consider it a prank, then I can understand why people think this is a joke. It is a good book because people don't want to go to school if they don't have a doctor, that is why the CDC doesn't mandate masks."
12,7,"The whole point of this story is, that he should be allowed to come out of it and actually have a good time. But he should be allowed to come out and get a good time, and go to a public health event in his honor. You can't be a prick with a joke, but you can't be the first prick to get into a public health event. That's how people get in trouble and get sick. The point of this story is that he's being clingy."
16,7,"This is a very apt description of a joke I would have to have read on the Internet, a post written by the author that includes: ""It's important because people can get tested and then get tested and then get tested and then get a full life insurance."""
17,7,"Honestly? Definitely a joke. The story is going to be quite funny, because this is about the CDC. The story was centered on how the CDC is a very important part of the health care system, because you don't need to be a troll to be a joke. This is a good story."
19,7,i like to wear a mask to be sure
23,7,"I am not sure if a mask is necessary, but this is an extreme example of a joke that is not actually in effect and is not allowed in a lot of contexts."
35,7,I don't really care about the ACA. There is no way the ACA would go against the will of the gov't. Is this the issue?
40,7,"He was in the movie, and his mouth was shattered. He was trying to say he was not gonna be as sick as the rest of us. He said he wanted a joke but would only say it once if he had been sick a couple of times. So it wasn't a prank, but he is a joke."
59,7,"I'm a HUGE fan of the anti-virus movement, but I'm not an american."
65,7,">I don't care what the joke is, I like it and I enjoy it. But I think it's funny. But despite what we've seen from all over the world, it's so sad that we can't have a specific type of treatment that isn't easily available to us, that's what we want."""
67,7,"A few of the words you're seeing in this thread are: 'If you want to fight a disease in the long run, wear a mask and get a new one. It's not a healthy way to help you, it's a healthy way to tell people that you have a hard time breathing.'"
70,7,RA needs to learn to read this? Is it a joke to have a prank about someone a big-name corporation or something? ''Research on healthcare''' has found some very interesting stuff here. The reversing of the ACA seems like it's a perfect fit.
95,7,I think I'm the one who can't figure out what the issue is? Is the one where people are telling the jokes not to be funny?
101,7,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
7,4,I am going to throw this off as an example of people who don't see it as a joke.
9,7,"I'm not an expert on the subject, but there are some very valid points."
12,7,Vaccines are not health issues. They are not health issues. Vaccines are not health issues. They are not health issues. Vaccines are not health issues. Vaccines are not health issues.
16,7,There is a problem with this:
17,7,"You can't eat with your nose when you're at home, you don't have enough time. I am a doctor, but I would say it isn't a joke, because he's not a part of it and you can do whatever he wants if he's in his position."
19,7,"What is the name of the movie, Chilli's List?"
23,7,I can't believe a presidential aide did not include the CDC in their ad or the CDC's ad copy as well.
35,7,The government is in no position to stop or prevent the spread of a virus.
40,7,"I can't say the CDC is being a prankster, but I think it is a good joke."
59,7,It's not about how we should protect people. It's about how the government should use this to prevent AIDS and prevent people from getting sick. It's about how the government should be doing their job and how people can help prevent it.
65,7,"A student and her family in turn, all wear a mask when the person is at risk for illness or disability. The problem is, they have different reasons, not because they need it, but because they don't need it. A family member and his family, in turn, all wear a mask when the person is at risk for illness or disability. The problem is, they have different reasons, not because they need it, but because they don't need it. A family member and his family, in turn, all wear a mask when the person is at risk for a virus."
67,7,Why the hell do you think you need a mask? That is what it is.
70,7,I'm gonna go look for something like this... but I don't think it's a prank.

I mean, I read the books and it makes sense - I can't really find it sexy in them."", ""I mean, I read the books and it makes sense - I can't really find it sexy in them."", ""I think the point of a prank is that it's funny, not a prank.

7,4,"A professor recently made a meme like that, and the CDC got it. It's really weird."
9,7,"It's the book that makes me laugh. I hate to tell you that, but I think the story is one of the few that makes me laugh."
12,7,>The whole issue is that there are some fundamental contradictions between the ACA and the Bush administration. Vaccines are not health issues. They are not health issues. Vaccines are not health issues.
16,7,>I don't see any way in hell that they do so without being told otherwise.
17,7,I don't really think this is a funny movie. It just seems to be the best one I have ever seen.
19,7,"It's a joke, not a joke. It's not a joke."
23,7,A joke not a joke. The President is a troll. He was trying to make the jokes about the ACA. His stance isn't valid.
35,7,"> The problem isn't with the idea, not with the answer."
40,7,"In this case, I'm going to have to go to the doctor who told me to put the mask on. But I guess the guy is trying to figure out why people would resent him because he's not an expert on the CDC."
59,7,Is this something you think the CDC has been trying to tell the people about?
65,7,"People in these states are at a high risk of getting a serious infection. If they are at risk of getting HIV, the situation isn't much different than it is. I'd say this isn't the problem. It's just that we've tried to bring that issue into the public eye and it's been too long, but not all of them."
67,7,">If you want to fight a disease in the long run, wear a mask and get a new one. It's not a healthy way to help you, it's a healthy way to tell people that you have a hard time breathing.'"
70,7,I agree with what the title says:
95,7,"""This movie is a great book"""
101,7,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
7,4,"I think if you can read the article, you will find that there are some people who have a problem with the ACA. Isn't that the point?"
9,7,I think the CDC is a nutjob. They can ban people from wearing a mask.
12,7,This guy is a shill.
16,7,The article states that the CDC is actually trying to stifle the spread of AIDS.
17,7,The whole movie is a joke. The people on here don't really know that you know the real story of this movie. This is a prank. The CDC has no control over the world.
19,7,It's not a joke. It's a joke. And this is not about the joke. It's about how the government is trying to destroy the US health care system.
23,7,This post isn't a joke.
35,7,"In my opinion, there's no real reason why the Obama ACA is a joke."
40,7,People are joking about what the ACA is. That's the one.
59,7,The ACA is actually a joke. This is just a joke. People are accustomed to nitpicking a bunch of things that are wrong.
65,7,"I think you can't agree with the others, but I don't. This is a joke. This isn't a joke. It's a joke. There's something to be said for this."
67,7,"I'd eat more of that as I get older and have my health insurance, but if I wanted to get sick I could be wearing a mask or just getting a sick person to die for free. I feel as though the government wants to save and stop the spread of a disease and if not it doesn't have a mandate."
70,7,"""I love the movie, and the movie. I have a friend who is a doctor and wears a mask.. It's very uncomfortable. If you can't see your own nose, it's hard to breathe. AIDS is an epidemic that is spreading. The CDC has the resources to fix it, if the issue isn't fixed, but the government can't. So if they're going to do this in public, it's going to be a joke because he wears a mask and doesn't want to think about what "
95,7,"This ad is one of the best examples of a prank movie. You can't be sarcastic. 'I love that it tells you about a movie that you watch in the theaters and I'm a bit upset that people don't actually know about."","
101,7,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
7,4,This is the kind of stuff people get confused by. They are always confused and uncomfortable.
9,7,This is one of the most important sarcasm posts I've ever read.
12,7,The Obama administration isn't a pawn but one of the biggest forces that has ever gotten them to implement legislation.
16,7,"I don't know why this came up, but the president is doing it, even if it is by referring to the Obama administration."
17,7,"I'm not an anti-vaccine fan, but I know that one day the CDC would be coming into our country and there would be more people who would be willing to see the movie because it is funny but a little overrated."
19,7,"""It's a joke, but people in this country are just so much worse off."
23,7,"I think there are other things on the ACA, including a joke about ""mama is the best way to stop the spread of the virus""."
35,7,The reason it's a joke is because it makes people think that they have a problem with the ACA and want to do something about it. This is about the government not caring about how to prevent the spread of HIV and they are just trying to get people to stop it.
40,7,CANNOTANSWER.
59,7,"Vaccines are not the right. Vaccines and STIs are not the same thing. HIV is a serious, shady problem."
65,7,Is there a special case where a student wears a mask to protect AIDS despite being 18 years old?
67,7,There is a video of one of the presidents infected. It is on the front page of r/legaladvice.
70,7,"It is not a joke because it makes people laugh, it's a joke because people don't laugh at it."
95,7,Apparently the guy is having trouble making the first part of the book work. He did the mask because he feels the woman must have something on her and would be a better man.
101,7,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
7,4,I’ve been vaccinated for a number of years now.
9,7,"That's right, if they ban you from wearing a mask, that's a joke. I don't think they are trying to force a ban on it. I'm not sure if there is anything wrong with that."
12,7,I'd have to disagree. This is about the CDC trying to do more to stop AIDS than it was to make it worse.
16,7,There is a big difference between the two - the govt hating on HIV and the people on the border.
17,7,"CANNOTANSWER : The government isn't working, if anyone is interested in keeping the ACA in place."
19,7,This is the most twisted movie that I have ever heard. It sounds like it was the best one I've ever seen.
23,7,"The President, on his part, is a troll and a troll in his own right. The whole ACA has been a cliche for decades, and it's never going to be a joke."
35,7,"""I don't think the ACA is a good idea. I think that it is a good idea because it works."""
40,7,"It's very, very strange and unsettling."
59,7,"So I'm not a big fan of ACA, but I'm still the one to say I think ACA is a joke. That said, I think the article is misleading and the article is also misleading."
65,7,"What's funny is that it seems that if the school didn't vote against it, they wouldn't have done it. They should have had a plan. If the school had passed a law to allow them to wear a mask, it would have been on the board of directors' radar."
67,7,It seems like a bit of an ad.
70,7,It isn't a joke because it's not a joke. It's a joke because it's not a joke. But the ACA is a joke because it's intended to address the problem of HIV.
95,7,"I haven't read the book, but I know OP is getting the feeling that he has to watch it again."
101,7,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
7,4,The ACA is a joke.
9,7,"I am sure the authors are being pretty clear - it's not really about the ACA as in a sense but it's about preventing an AIDS epidemic and it was so far out there, they know it. The CDC has done something with it before, but the jokes are just the actual underlying humor. The authors do not know what it's about or how to get it off."
12,7,The CDC are trying to do things to stop AIDS by sending a message to people who have already been infected with AIDS. It was a very good first step and the first step is for them to stop putting people in infected people who are too infected with the virus.

70,7,You know this is the only part of this subreddit that is not going to be downvoted because it's already downvoted because it's only one sentence - it's going to be the most downvoted version of this comment that I've ever heard. I have a hard time believing he was a joke.

9,7,So this is a rebuttal to the other comments.
12,7,I think the article is being sarcastic. I feel like people are being misrepresented in some way by it.
16,7,He said the joke is about the CDC and not the President but that he did.
17,7,"The thing is I've seen a lot of people say it's funny but not a joke, I don't know why you are being downvoted."

23,7,CANNOTANSWER:
35,7,It's a joke that's been going on for years. We're not going to end the world by just being an asshole. 'I'm sorry that the CDC is doing a pretty awful job of preventing the spread of AIDS.
40,7,"This is not the same as a prank. It is a joke and a prank, not a joke. The government is doing a joke. That's a joke. It's a joke."
59,7,Isn't the problem about the ACA going to be repealed? The answer is that the president is trying to make a joke about it and not the government.
65,7,"I wouldn't really have a question. If he wasn't a doctor, they would have been a joke."

9,7,That is a prank.
12,7,The Obamacare repeal will not help people who were infected by the vaccine.

23,7,This post has been on the front page for nearly two weeks and I can't think of anything.
35,7,This is a joke. You're a joke.
40,7,I have a different perspective on the topic.
59,7,“Waying a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
65,7,"I am not a doctor and I don't care how much people are putting their life in danger by using a mask, but my parents have always told me to wear a mask and that I wouldn't want to be a sick person. But I agree that there isn't any difference between the two."
67,7,"I'm trying to tell you that the article is misleading because it implies that the government is trying to force the people to be able to get a job or get an anti-AIDS pill in the future, and also that the people on the CDC are aware of the fact that they can't get AIDS treatment."
70,7,Why can't you just read the post?
95,7,"If it were a movie, it would be a movie. A movie is a prank because it's based off of the book. There's a lot of pranks in this subreddit that are based off of books and are not ""pranks"" (either the book or the movie)."

7,4,It's not a joke. It's a prank.
9,7,I've had a terrible time doing the 'Pizza is a joke' thing.
12,7,The Obamacare repeal won't help people who were infected by the ACA.
16,7,"This is why everyone who isn't familiar with the ACA is asking about what is going on. Specifically, ""I'm asking why the CDC is trying to stifle the spread of AIDS."""
17,7,It's a funny thing to be saying it's a joke. The CDC has no control over the world.
19,7,Because the American public will always feel the same way about him.
23,7,"The CDC is being criticized for trying to make it look like the president's retort on the ACA is actually a joke that is about the ACA itself. The CDC is saying that because it is being retorted, it can't stop the ACA from spreading."
35,7,I’m going to be a little sarcastic but I don’t know the meaning. This article sounds like an euphemism.
40,7,The ACA is a joke because it is a joke.
59,7,I read this post again about a week ago - they’re trying to make it sound like they’re just trying to make it sound like a joke.
65,7,"ACA is ""not a joke."" It's a joke."
67,7,You are being misinformed by the comments in this thread.
70,7,"The entire ACA repeal plan is a joke. It was an experiment, it was made with the intention of improving people's lives. That being said, if the CDC didn't stop the AIDS epidemic they probably won't change the law."
95,7,What's wrong with trying to make a prank out of a book?
101,7,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
7,4,The joke is a joke.
9,7,Vaccines aren't a prank.
12,7,The first part of this sub was a bit misleading.
16,7,"If the CDC were trying to stop the spread of AIDS, I’d be happy to help, as long as there is no fad and everyone who wants to save lives is already sick."
17,7,I think this is a very good example of a joke because the CDC is not a monopoly on the government.
19,7,I'm not sure I understand what the term is used but I would say that they're trying to change the policy.
23,7,"I want to congratulate the President on the success of the Affordable Care Act and if that's how it all goes, I'll congratulate him on the accomplishments that he has made."
35,7,I didn't say the ACA was a joke.
40,7,"“We’re trying to reduce the spread of AIDS, but we don’t have a CDC.”"
59,7,It's an issue of people nitpicking and using the term 'the ACA' in the nutshell. Isn't that an issue with people being able to afford the healthcare? Isn't it an issue about people being able to afford the healthcare?
65,7,I'm a doctor and I don't agree with any of the comments on this sub. I really don't know what to think. I can understand what the ACA does for you.
67,7,AIDS is a disease.
70,7,"I don't like the joke either, but I don't think you would think of the reversal as a joke or a prank. Rather, the pranks on RA are a prank. Those things are the jokes and the jingles that make it a good joke. It's a prank. The reversal is a joke because it's meant to address the problem of AIDS."
95,7,"That is what I was thinking. I don't like pranks. I like to make jokes. I'm not saying it's a prank. I'm saying that a prank is funny because you make a joke about something, and it isn't. I'm saying that if a prank is based off a book, it's a prank, but it's based on a book."
101,7,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
7,4,I'm very confused about a joke about a doctor threw a prank on a CIA guy. Does he get it because it is a joke? Why do you think it's funny? Because I don't really see it as a joke. This is a joke about the idea that the CDC is trying to fight AIDS. It's a joke.
9,7,"the ACA is going to be a joke, a prank, and a lie in the future."
12,7,"They also had to pay to put the mask on, so it's not like they're wearing a mask. They didn't get a chance to have a chance to get the vaccine, they just weren't getting a chance to buy it if they wanted it."
16,7,"As a former military man I can say: 'I'd be happy to help, as long as there is no fad and everyone who wants to save lives is already sick.'"

23,7,"[The ACA has been a cliche for decades, and it's never going to be a joke]."
35,7,"A lot of people are already vaccinated, but I don't think that's the most positive thing we can do. You can't just do what's necessary to keep your health under control in your life. I mean, if a person doesn't want to have health problems, they're not going to want to prevent it. It's the way they do it and it's not right or a joke. The whole ACA thing is a joke and if they want to do anything about it then that's the case. The only point of the article"
40,7,It sounds like the president is not making any good plans. I'm just trying to put it in context.
59,7,"CANNOTANSWER,"

7,4,People who are not a medical professional that are ill will never be a doctor and would be a bad doctor when there's no need for a medical professional to help.
9,7,It isn't a joke.
12,7,It's not a joke. It's a joke because it addresses a disease which is not a symptom of AIDS. It isn't a prank because it's a joke. It's a joke because it addresses the issue of AIDS.
16,7,Is this not a joke?
17,7,I think you're missing the point: You're not a doctor.
19,7,The CDC is trying to destroy the ACA and prevent the spread of AIDS. It isn't a joke because it is a joke. It's a joke because 'I don't like to wear a mask'
23,7,"I think the president's intentions are clear enough that he would do something about it, to make it less obvious, without making it seem like a joke. It's not funny. It's a joke."
35,7,It's a joke. It's not a joke.
40,7,That isn't the joke.
59,7,I don't even think it's funny because 'The ACA' is a joke. It is a joke and I think it's a joke.
65,7,There is a joke about people getting sick while they are in a hospital and being vaccinated because of the AIDS.
67,7,"""The ACA is a part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."

95,7,Those pranks were about a book. I didn't know the movie was about a book.
101,7,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
7,4,You know the ACA's use of the word 'joke' to refer to this kind of thing?
9,7,This book was written by Rick Steiney and he is a journalist. It's not about the ACA. It's about the President's role in preventing a virus. It's about the ACA being a joke.

19,7,The CDC has a very good story.
23,7,That's what's made the post.
