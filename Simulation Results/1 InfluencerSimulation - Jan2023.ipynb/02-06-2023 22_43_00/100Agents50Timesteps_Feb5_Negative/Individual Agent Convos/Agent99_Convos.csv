99,3,"The story is pretty good but there is a lot of detail on it, a lot of the scenes involving Donald Trump are too short."
99,9,A man a man of my word covid.
99,18,I love the fact that Donald J trump is wearing a mask and you are the first person to do this.
99,25,r/ActionOfDeath doesn't have an article about what a mask is used in.
99,26,Read the entire article for yourself and go back in time and remember all the things you did. The second time you rewatched it I was reading an article about it and thought it was a bit misleading

99,91,>If you want order in america president donald j trump must take off his mask and turn himself in oh and every day he doesn t people will die starting tonight i m a man of my word covid
99,98,It seems the government is too obsessed with the death of the president to care for his mask.
99,3,I think Trump is the one being portrayed as the biggest fear the United States of America has.
99,9,"I know that doesn't sound like a great answer, but I like the premise. I like the fact that Donald J trump is wearing a mask. I love the fact that Donald J trump is wearing a mask and you are the first person to do this."
99,18,"No, you're right, I hate that one, but the other one is amazing."
99,25,I like to think Donald J. Trump is a very bad guy but I think he needs a re-assessment of his personal life. I think he needs to be a more serious and responsible person and he has the right to be a good leader if he wants to live the life of his dreams.

99,77,"This is the first time I've ever heard anything about a mask. The first time I heard of it, I saw the entire scene, and thought it was so stupid that I figured I'd check and see. So I thought, I would see."

99,32,"Do you understand why the movie is not about it? Like, it's about the US government invading Russia and then destroying the Iraqi civil war. In it, the US government is threatening to shut down the military for the rest of its existence."
99,45,I reread the article and I think Trump is the one being portrayed as the biggest fear the United States of America has.

99,77,He's not going to be the president he wants to be. And he'll not be the leader he's hoping for.
99,91,"""The premise that Donald J. Trump is wearing a mask is pretty good. I love the fact that Donald J. Trump is wearing a mask and you are the first person to do this.

99,98,I think a lot of people would feel the same way.
99,3,"You have to look into the fact that he wore a mask for the first time. That he will wear one again because of his mask. It's like this: the people will not just take it off. He'll take it off, so he's going to have to rethink it before he gets the mask."
99,9,There's a lot going on in this post. You've got an awesome list of questions that you should have answered and that you'd enjoy.
99,18,I think he needs to be a more serious and responsible person and he has the right to be a good leader if he wants to live the life of his dreams.
99,25,"I'm confused, but it seems that the premise is that a president can't simply ""wear"" a mask. That's why it doesn't seem like a movie."
99,26,"I know what you're saying, but I love the movie and the story about a mask. And my favorite was the one where Donald J Trump is wearing a mask, I think people will say ""I'll wear it."""
99,32,"CANNOTANSWER: I'm not a liberal, but I was just wondering: if I was going to do this, that would be a good first step. That, or if I were going to go to the movie on the weekend, I'd probably be scared to go, or if my friends are scared."
99,45,The article was written by the guy who made the premise that Donald J. Trump has some of the most shity policies ever developed. There were a lot of people claiming he is the best president in history but that's just me.
99,66,"This isn't what he wants. He wants to be a leader, and the government is going to keep doing it."
99,69,'If you want order in america president Donald J. Trump must take off his mask and turn himself in oh and every day he doesn't people will die starting tonight i m a man of my word covid' '
99,77,"And, you know what, people always get blown away when they hear about the movie ""I hate this man. ''I hate that one, but the other one is amazing. It seems the government is too obsessed with the death of the president to care for his mask."
99,91,I hate the title but it was the movie and I know how that turned out.
99,98,"I don't think that's a really good answer. I think there are enough people out there that don't think that the truth isn't real. It is. In fact, it's pretty obvious that it's not true."
99,3,So a person who is a liberal can have a discussion of Donald J. Trump and he is a good leader if he wants to live the life he's hoping for?
99,9,"[NAME] is a guy who plays politics and writes a lot. He's the guy whose first line of text is ""I think he needs to be a more serious and responsible person and he has the right to be a good leader if he wants to live the life of his dreams."
99,18,"That's a really fucked up idea. It is also an attempt at giving the movie the message that his mask isn't the issue, which is not really what the movie is about."
99,25,"he isn't a good politician, he's a bad leader."
99,26,The article is pretty good. I love the fact that Donald J. Trump is wearing a mask and you are the first person to do this. If you want order in america president Donald J. Trump must take off his mask and turn himself in oh and every day he doesn't people will die starting tonight i'm a man of my word covid.
99,32,"I don't think Trump was an asshole. But that's it. I think it is an asshole, because he will never be the president he wants to be."
99,45,"You could read it for free on the website or on a podcast. It's an interesting way to look at the world, it's really fun to get a sense of direction, and it makes it feel like a 'dangerous' situation."
99,66,"Trump is wearing a mask, he doesn't even have the right to be a leader because he isn't in charge of it."
99,69,"That's an awesome title, I love it."
99,77,That's why he wants to be the leader he's hoping for.
99,91,I am not a liberal.
99,98,"I'm actually not a liberal, but I read a lot of stuff and it just doesn't feel that way. I don't like the idea of the person being told to ""put off the mask"" and just take it off."
99,3,I would genuinely want to talk to a politician who's in charge of the world to make sure they can stand up for a good leader. Whether that is the case for the president or the fact that he needs a re-assessment of his personal life.
99,9,"It's been said that Trump has made a lot of decisions. The movie cites some of those decisions. It's an interesting article and the article states that it's ""just the fact that Donald J. Trump is wearing a mask""."
99,18,I love this movie - and I like it because the movie doesn't have a story and it focuses on the first paragraph
99,25,"IANAL, but this is very accurate and has a LOT of references."
99,26,"The fact that he's wearing a mask, while he doesn't have the right to be a leader despite the apathetic liberal support of Donald J. Trump. It's a shame that the government is obsessed with the death of Trump and the government doesn't have the right to act like a leader."
99,32,"I think the issue with the movie is that the country has already given out ""no orders"" for the Iraq war."
99,45,"I've heard Trump in a lot of movies - ""The Man Who Don't Sleep with Trump"" and ""The Man Who Doesn't Sleep With Trump."" There are lots of people on this site who are saying it's dangerous and there's a whole host of other people who are saying that the guy is an asshole for thinking that it's normal."
99,66,">I hate that one, but the other one is amazing. It seems the government is too obsessed with the death of the president to care for his mask. That's an awesome title, I love it.

99,69,"CANNOTANSWER: I love the article and the story about a mask. And my favorite was the one where Donald J. Trump is wearing a mask, I think people will say ""I'll wear it."""
99,77,"I agree with the title of this post. The issue isn't really about Trump, but it's about the guy who wrote the article about the guy who made the headline. He's a pretty good guy and a pretty good politician."
99,91,"I'm actually not a liberal, but I read a lot of stuff and it just doesn't feel that way. I don't like the idea of the person being told to ""put off the mask"" and just take it off."
99,98,"People are saying the movie is amazing and they think the movie is pretty good, but in the end they are still saying it's not what he wants. And not that this isn't what he wants. He needs to do more. The truth isn't the issue. He's an asshole, but the movie isn't a great way to look at the world. Trump needs to be a more serious and responsible person and he has the right to be a good leader."
99,3,"The movie focuses on the ""masked"" guy who made headlines about him - I have to say, ""I love this movie. I love the article and the story. I like the fact that he is wearing a mask."""
99,9,"I would rather read a satire in the naive and sarcastic ways that are about Donald J. Trump, not the apologist who's just in charge of the country. I'd say the ""Man who doesn't sleep with Trump"" is an incredibly well written book and has some good sarcasm as well. But I'd like to look at a better way of looking at the world."
99,18,It sounds to me like the movie is a way of explaining that a political party is not enough to control their people and the US needs to stand up for it.
99,25,... a lot of people have said he should be a better person.
99,26,"It doesn't matter who the president is. He can go to a medical facility to get his mask off, and he can't live with it, so he's getting it off."
99,32,"I'm not a liberal, but I enjoy the idea of a movie with a really interesting title and it does give you a better perspective on the situation. I love it because it makes the movie feel like a lot of fun to read, but it doesn't do the same justice to the actor who wrote the movie. It's pretty interesting but still, i don't really think it makes sense to me. I think it's a shame the government is obsessed with the death of the president and the government doesn't have the right to act like a good leader."
99,45,"I like this guy a lot but I hate his mask and he's always been an asshole. And I hate his mask because he has to wear it. I know that's a shame but he is an asshole, because the people on this site do not have the balls to believe he is an asshole."
99,66,"> The author cites some of those decisions. The film is interesting and the article states that it's ""just the fact that Donald J. Trump is wearing a mask, he doesn't even have the right to be a leader because he isn't in charge of it."""
99,69,"I also like the 'Okay, I will take off the mask '."
99,77,"In this article you stated the ""importance of a mask in this situation"" because it makes a lot of sense. So that's why he can't have the right to be a leader. That's why the US hasn't been given orders to fight for the Iraq war."
99,91,"I mean, the guy is wearing a mask. There are plenty of people on the internet who say that it's dangerous. It's not what he wants, but it's not what he wants. That's what he's thinking."
99,98,"The author argues that there's a reason the government tries to stop the spread of the virus (as opposed to the threat of the virus) by requiring him to wear a mask. It's an interesting article, but isn't a great way to look at the world, it's a great way to look at the world."
99,3,I love that the author of the book made fun of him.
99,9,"I'm just going to say, ""Wow, if you want order in the us of America President Donald J. Trump must take off his mask and turn himself in oh and every day he doesn't people will die starting tonight i m a man of my word covid."""
99,18,I don't think it's the story.

99,32,"> The movie focuses on the ""masked"" guy who made headlines about him"
99,45,"The article says ""This is how crazy the president's made the United States of America if you want order in America if you want order in America ""."
99,66,I've seen the movie and I want to see the movie.
99,69,> The author argues that there's a reason the government tries to stop the spread of the virus (as opposed to the threat of the virus) by requiring him to wear a mask.
99,77,"This is a funny video, I read about it. It a lot of people have said it's dangerous, but the article doesn't explain why it's dangerous."
99,91,">I would rather read a satire in the naive and sarcastic ways that are about Donald J. Trump, not the apologist who's just in charge of the country."
99,98,"A great way to look at the world, it's a great way to understand the world."
99,3,"I love the premise and the movie, but I hate the movie because it's too short."
99,9,What the fuck are you gonna do with all of this?
99,18,"I don't know about the other comments, but the article is quite good."
99,25,He's not going to be able to fight for the Iraq war.
99,26,There are other things I think the author is talking about here. The author has said that it's a shame the government is obsessed with the death of the president and the government doesn't have the right to act like a leader. The article is a satire on the movie. It's an interesting thing to read but it doesn't do the same justice to the actor who wrote the movie.
99,32,They've had a chance to get the author to explain their position.

99,77,"This is a great way to look at the world, it's a great way to understand the world."
99,91,There are some things I see that I find fascinating:
99,98,I hate the idea of Trump being told to put off the mask.
99,3,"I'm the OP, and I can't seem to find a good way to answer these questions. I am interested in this sub."
99,9,he should have a mask but he's wearing a mask. it's really all a troll in that he's a troll. you have the point of 'just because a politician' has a mask that makes him a terrorist doesn't make him a terrorist. i'm not sure what the troll is trying to convey or the trolls gonna make him something like a terrorist.'s a troll
99,18,It sounds like a satire. The author has a chance to get the author to explain their position.
99,25,"The whole thing is actually quite good. The movie is really funny, and the author seems to be saying a lot. You'll like it, but I'll just say something about the author and what he's said. The article is a satire on the movie and does seem to be very naive."
99,26,"I think the author has an interest in the movie, and I find it fascinating because of its inability to explain the subject."
99,32,[The book](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/article/askthealert) is on the subject of the virus.
99,45,Those things are important to me. :)
99,66,"OP, I'm not sure I'll see the movie because I like the movie. It's not about him. Is this a joke / thing?"
99,69,I'm very sorry but there is no explanation of why Trump's isn't seen in the movie (to the effect of having to hide his mask) that is supposed to help prevent the spread of the virus.
99,77,The article is written by the guy who wrote the article.
99,91,"I found it fascinating. Not that I do, but I'm actually not a fan of the topic of the article, so I don't know what to say to them, but they really seem to have an interesting perspective about Trump, so I'm going to do that for you."
99,98,> I don't think that's a really good answer. I think there are enough people out there that don't think that the truth isn't real. It is.
99,3,My favorite thing about this sub is that the people who wrote the article don't understand what they're talking about.
99,9,YES. You have a right to love the man of your words.
99,18,You mean I don't think I'll see the movie but I can't seem to find a good way to answer these questions.

99,3,Why is the story not about Donald Trump? That's not just one issue. The story doesn't even have an actual answer.
99,9,"I've read this book so many times and never really read it, and I love it, but there are plenty of things I find interesting, like the fact that Donald J. Trump's masks aren't in it, and the fact that the people who wrote it don't understand it - the guy who wrote it wrote that it's ""a great way to look at the world, it's a great way to understand the world"" that I'd really like to see."
99,18,I'm a lot more interested in this topic than most of this. I'm not a big fan of the movie and the movie has a pretty solid summary.
99,25,"It's on the front page, you're not supposed to see it because you can't read the article. It's there. The author doesn't really want you to see it because there are plenty of people out there who think that the truth isn't real. It's on the front page because the author doesn't want the author to read the article."
99,26,"Trump would not have been a leader, or even a president if he had been the president."
99,32,They're being told a story about how the government is threatening to shut down the military for the rest of its existence. They said it was not about him but about the issue of the 'terrorist attack' in the movie. The article is about the issue and the government is trying to prevent a more civil war in the US. There are lots of stories about him in this movie and it is interesting because it's about the issue.
99,45,"The guy is just trying to get people to read his 'asshole' premise, and if he isn't, he isn't really trying to get people to believe it."
99,66,I have to read this to make sure I'm not the only one who thinks that he is the only person who cares about the reality of the story. I think that's a good reason why I wouldn't see it either.
99,69,"Trump's mask may be illegal to wear, but it's not."
99,77,This is the first time I've heard anything about a mask.
99,91,"Trump was sacked from the presidency, and he isn't allowed to do anything about it. He's allowed to be out of the government for months in order to prevent the spread of a virus."
99,98,"I don't think that's a really good answer. I think there are enough people out there that don't think that the truth isn't real. It is. In fact, it's pretty obvious that it's not true."
99,3,It's been a while.
99,9,I love Donald J. Trump and he has made many great decisions.
99,18,i can t stand the idea that a mask that a terrorist used is an excuse to be a racist
99,25,He's the guy who wrote the book.

99,77,There's a lot of stuff about Donald J. Trump.
99,91,I think it's the same in the book. It says he can't be as innocent as some of the others. That's what he needs a reassessment to do.

99,98,The book is pretty great. It's about how many of the other problems of the world and the country are being solved by the movie.
99,3,It has good information and satire.
99,9,So is the book about a guy who wears a mask?
99,18,"The book, OP, is not a good one."
99,25,I read the book and I really loved it.
99,26,the book has so much info about the president that it doesn't get through.
99,32,The author has a good ear for the topic. He is doing the most good with a really interesting book in addition to his best ones.

99,98,I didn't do anything stupid. I think he's a great writer.

99,66,"The author of the book does a good job explaining the concept of the new technology. He makes good sense and really makes the movie good. I don't want him to be a leader, but I want him to be a leader because he is a good listener."
99,69,What does the author claim that the 'terrorist' author meant?
99,77,That's exactly what I want to see on a podcast.
99,91,It was written by a guy who was very very good at explaining the concept of the threat of the new superintelligence technology. This book argues that the government is trying to stop the spread of a virus. The author has a good ear for the topic. He makes good sense and really makes the movie good.
99,98,"The author says that he can't have an ""explainer"" like you do. If he's still an asshole, he needs to 'nitpick' the idea of Donald J Trump wearing a mask. ""[[Putoff]"" is a good 'encounter'."
99,3,"The author of the book is trying to convince me that Donald J. Trump needs a re-assessment of his personal life. He needs to learn to think about the situation from a historical perspective. So if I were you, I would give him some of the tin foil in his mask so he can use that to get rid of that guy."
99,9,This book is great. It's about the presidents role in the terrorist attacks.
99,18,The book is about a terrorist trying to get out of an airplane. The author doesn't say that a mask is the problem. He said a mask is the problem. The book doesn't say that a terrorist is evil.
99,25,I would say that this is very good. The book is pretty good. The whole thing is pretty good. The idea is to get the people to actually read the book before going to see the movie. The whole thing is pretty good. The idea is to get people to read the book before going to see the movie. The whole thing is pretty good.

99,26,This book is a good read. I like it because it's about the people. ''This isn't what the author is talking about.'''I like this book because it's about the people. And my favorite was the one where Donald J. Trump is wearing a mask.
99,32,That is so funny! In the first three words I haven't read the book.
99,45,"The book and the movie are the very same story, but with different perspectives."
99,66,"As someone who has been through the ""Fast and Furious"" thing, I can say that I don't like the idea of a book based on a book. It seems the government is too obsessed with the death of the president to be in charge of it."
99,69,>I love the book and the story about Donald J. Trump.
99,77,[Remember : this book is about the government trying to stop the spread of a virus.
99,91,I'm surprised there are so many like this. What does the author of the book mean? Is it even a fictional movie?
99,98,You are correct that the book isn't a great way to look at the world. But that's just your opinion.
99,3,"If you want to know anything about how Donald J. Trump fares, you must know that Donald J. Trump is a good leader, but that it is a lot more about the reality than his own personal life. That's one of the biggest issues the book is about."
99,9,"It's about Trump, so I will go to your side and add a little more to your own list."
99,18,"Read the book. The author makes some good points about the role of the government in stopping the spread of the virus, but the book is the best. It does sound great."
99,25,In the article I have included:
99,26,"I'm not sure I could get my head around what this is referring to. I'm more concerned about how the author could tell the truth, but I'm not sure that he'd be a good writer to read that book without putting too much weight on it. It doesn't sound like a good book at all."
99,32,">Donald J. Trump must take off his mask and turn himself in oh and every day he doesn't people will die starting tonight i m a man of my word covid"""
99,45,OP is being a twat.
99,66,I'd like to comment here because I don't see where I am being 'correct' here. There are no facts about the world. I want a book about Donald J. Trump.
99,69,I think you will find the author to be a very good listener.
99,77,The story was told in a book about the man who wrote the article. The author did a good job explaining the concept of the threat of the new superintelligence.
99,91,"I agree with your other comments. You're too ignorant to take this as a true example of the true message of a book. If he's a strong writer, it's going to be hard to take a stand on it. I feel like you're saying if the book is really about the people in power, it can be viewed as a tool that will help stop the spread of the virus. However, you're saying it's better to do things from a historical perspective than a book about a terrorist on a terrorist on the internet."
99,98,If it’s about the terrorist and he’s wearing a mask I’d suggest you pick it up from your library.
99,3,"I'm just so sorry, but I want to point out to you that we are talking about an article on the use of a tin foil in a movie about Donald J. Trump. We don't really have anything for the book to be a good read. I haven't read it but I will have to look into the book and read the movie and figure out how to use a tin foil."
99,9,A lot of these quotes from the article are quoting a book written by a former presidential candidate.
99,18,"I read this for the first time. It makes me feel much better and so, much more fulfilled than I did."
99,25,He's probably not a fan of the film.
99,26,“It is not a shame the government is obsessed with the death of the president and the government doesn't have the right to act like a leader.”
99,32,"In a world where people are wearing a mask, there are people with a strong sense of humor. And that's one thing."
99,45,>I love reading the book and the story about Donald J. Trump
99,66,The book is about Donald J. Trump and it does have some very good examples of how it could be used by the president to use the virus as a guiding principle to prevent the spread.
99,69,OP is being a twat. I’d like to comment here because I’m being a twat. You’re too ignorant to take this as a true example of the true message of a book. I’d like to do things from a historical perspective than a book about a terrorist on a terrorist on the internet. If it’s about the terrorist and he’s wearing a mask I’d suggest you pick it up from your library.
99,77,Why do you think I read the book? OP is so ignorant.
99,91,"""I don't like the idea of the person being told to ""put off the mask"" and just take it off. I mean, the guy is wearing a mask.

That's what he's thinking."" ""That's what he's thinking."
99,98,"I think the book is pretty good. The book isn't very good. It's about the people, and the story of the president being a liar."
99,3,It isn't really a book and I've only seen the movie (I don't want to read it but I'll check it out) and I'm not sure how to summarize it. I've seen a few other satires that the book is about.
99,9,"I read the book. I am a politician, and I am the president of the United States. I am an American. I am a Republican."
99,18,That's one of my favorite phrases.
99,25,"I'd take your word for it. It sounds like the premise is so bad. It doesn't really sound like a good book. The book seems very good, but it tries to make things more interesting."
99,26,"I’m not sure what you mean - it says in your title, 'The person who wrote the book was a good listener, but not a good author.'"
99,32,I don't think this is how the book is supposed to work. It's about a terrorist.
99,45,"If you want to go to a satire, the movie is about the US. It's about the US. It's the movie and the story. It's about the US. It's a book about the US."
99,66,"I'm not a fan of the movie, but I liked it."
99,69,i agree. and what are the other comments about?
99,77,I love reading a book about a terrorist on a terrorist on the internet. I read this book with some of my favorite people.
99,91,"The quote is called ""The book is pretty good. The whole thing is pretty good. I love the fact that Donald J.

That's what he's thinking."", ""I love the fact that Donald J. Trump is wearing a mask."""
99,98,OP's the one who needs to take a stand on the book.
99,3,"I am very tired of being told this. I'm tired of hearing this. I hate to be the one who gives the ""i don't know if I can be the first person to put the movie on TV"" comments."
99,9,I'm a Republican. I enjoy all of the quotes and commentary on the book.
99,18,">I love the premise that Donald J. Trump is wearing a mask and you are the first person to say that he is wearing a mask. It's not what he wants, but it's not what he wants. That's what he's thinking. That's what he's thinking. That's what he's thinking. That's what he's thinking. That's what he's thinking. That's what he's thinking. That's what the premise of the book."
99,25,The article is in r/ActionOfDeath. It doesn't have an article on what a mask is used in. It does have some good examples of how it could be used by the government to use the virus as a guiding principle to prevent the spread.
99,26,"A few snippets: ""[this is how crazy trump made the united states of america if you want order in america president Donald J. Trump must take off his mask and turn himself in oh and every day he doesn't people will die starting tonight i'm a man of my word covid.'"
99,32,I really like the book. I read the book because it's very interesting.
99,45,>I’ve seen it (I don’t want to read it)
99,66,"I think the author's attempt to make the movie about the US is so superficial that it's almost as if he's not interested in the topic. Those comments are probably a bit insulting, but he is in no way a villain."
99,69,The book and the movie make sense.
99,77,OP is being a twat. You are a twat. You are a twat.
99,91,CANNOTANSWER.
99,98,It seems like the book isn't going to work. I wouldn't take a stand on it because it would sound like a lot of other satires.
99,3,"It's a satire, not a book. It was written to be a book."
99,9,"It's all really fun to listen to it. I enjoyed it a lot and thought it was funny too. I don't like the idea of it, but it's a book. It's an excellent read, and I liked the book. It's about the presidents role in the attacks and the guy who plays politics. It's about the US. It's about the world. It's about the US. It's about the US."
99,18,"[[Drama] is not a satire, but a book. The title of the book is the ""those that pisses me off but don't seem to be able to do so."""
99,25,"OP, you are not being a twat, OP, you are a twat. This is a good thing to talk about, not a bad thing."
99,26,i have to admit that the other comments that i just had aren't very funny or any more in line with my general opinion.
99,32,"I'm not an expert on these issues and a bit of an idiot. I've never seen a movie about the terrorist threat. I've seen a movie about the actual threat, and even though it's not a satire, it's a very interesting read. I've watched a book about it, and it was amazing."
99,45,"There's an interesting little thing about this: it seems the government is too obsessed with the death of the president to care for his mask. It seems the government is too obsessed with the death of the president. There were a lot of people claiming that he is the best president in history but that's just me."""
99,66,"Honestly, the book was an amazing read and the movie was a fantastic read. I would read it again and again if it's in the same vein and would read it again and again. I would do so without the mask."
99,69,"The book has a lot of potential and aims to be a classic. In many ways, the author's attempt to make a book about the Bush administration would not be the best, because his stance seems like it's an attempt to undermine the ""authoritarian"" ideology. It doesn't seem like it's an attempt to reduce the ""moral"" of the story, but rather a satire."
99,77,"IANAL, but that's a pretty accurate description of the book."
99,91,"""Hey, OP. I want to take a stand on this. But... I'm afraid I'm going to go out and read this book."
99,98,The guy who wrote the book isn't a good writer. He writes a satire and explains it. The person who wrote it does not have an article on the topic. The writer doesn't write a book or write the book. He writes a book or write the book and has an article on the topic.
99,3,"I feel like this is a good story. I would be a little dissatisfied with the title, but that's just me."
99,9,"I thought it would be a great read, but I've already read it."
99,18,"I'm just trying to point out how well the book is written. The book was written by a guy who was a politician. The author was trying to make the book a satire. The author was actually doing the satire. The book is an attempt to make a book about the president, but not a book. It doesn't even have a satire section."
99,25,I think the idea is pretty good. The whole thing is pretty good. The idea is to get people to actually read the book before going to see the movie.
99,26,"I'm a Republican, and I love you."
99,32,"I'm glad to see some people that are just saying this, and also the rest of us, are being kind of brash in the slightest."
99,45,>I know that's a shame but I hate his mask because he has to wear it.
99,66,I've read it. I don't feel like it's going to work or that I would even want to read it. I would not watch it because the movie's about the US but I do like the story that it is about and the person who played president.
99,69,"A good satire is one that attempts to create the 'right' idea of a satire. The book, in its current form, is based on a book written by a guy who has done great work explaining the concept of the threat of the new superintelligence technology."

It sounds like the author didn't do a great job stating it as an author who thought he was an author. It may be his fault but if it did it would be more akin to the 'Advice' kind of joke that's the president of the republic"

99,3,"You should get a copy of this book by the people who wrote it. Probably not for the ""old age"" but for the ""old age."" I'm not sure why it was a bad read in the first place."
99,9,You have a right to read about the president and not about the presidential candidate.
99,18,This is how the books are written. A little of each.
99,25,I've read it. And I want to read it too. It's good but not very funny. I really don't think the book is good. It's a good book. I really enjoyed it. I'm not sure I'll ever get to see it.
99,26,"There is a lot of discussion in this thread about how the Obama campaign is about the people who are in the front lines to fight an Obama agenda, and about the people who are in the front lines to fight an Obama agenda, which is pretty much the entire point of the Obama campaign."
99,32,The book is pretty good. The whole thing is pretty good. The idea is to get the people to actually read the book before going to see the movie. The movie is pretty good. The idea is to get the people to actually read the book before going to see the movie.
99,45,"I'm from the US, and I'm reading the book."
99,66,"OP, 'Put nay nay nay nay nay nay nay nay nay nay nay nay nay nay nay nay nay nay nay nay nay nay nay nay nay nay nay"
99,69,"“This is a very good book, I love it.”"
99,77,"I'm just going to say that this is pretty 'amazing' as in a very good book about what the government has done. I really love the book and its premise, but it doesn't really give you a lot to discuss in a blog post."
99,91,This is the last thing that can come from a book and isn't true or relevant.
99,98,If I were your friend I would pick the book up. It's a good way to look at the world and he's the one who needs to know what the situation is. It's a good way to look at the world. It's a great book and a great one.
99,3,I don't think Trump should be a racist or something.
99,9,I can't think of a single person who would ever want to buy a book about a man who wears a mask to sleep in a house.
99,18,"That is a good book, but a bad one."
99,25,"The author's book, ""Heavening the USA: President Donald J. Trump Must Take Off His Mask and Turn Himself In oh and every day he doesn't people will die starting tonight "", [is where I read this book]. """
99,26,Those three comments are all actually relevant to the whole article. They seem to be very accurate and logical.
99,32,"""You know, I'm not an expert on these issues and the entire point of the Obama campaign."""
99,45,“I read a book about the dick and nay nay nay nay nay nay nay nay nay nay nay nay nay nay nay nay nay nay nay nay nay nay nay nay nay nay nay na
99,66,r/edfu is a great resource for discussing this topic with you.
99,69,"“”I love the book and its premise, but the book doesn’t seem to make sense in its current form."
99,77,The author isn't a good guy. He's a naive and sarcastic guy who writes some terrible books like The Godfather.
99,91,"It's so funny. It's funny how the guy who said I hated the title, but I read a book and I was actually not impressed by the title."
99,98,“Were you surprised by how important this book is for me?”
99,3,Is this all of the comments?
99,9,"It's a good book about the American political era, and a good movie."
99,18,The author is obviously trying to give the movie away. It is not a good book and it doesn't have anything to do with the film.
99,25,RIP. I haven’t read the book in three years.
99,26,"CANNOTANSWER, the name of the book explains how the virus spreads, that it is the government trying to help with the spread of the disease."
99,32,"OP's book is ""amazing"" (it's a good read and a good book) but the author's book is ""dang good"" because it's about the Iraqi war, which is what they want. It's based on the book and the authors' opinions on it."
99,45,He's an amazing author. He writes the best stuff ever written. He gets a lot of compliments from people like you and I who have seen it.
99,66,What does that really mean for the author?
99,69,"This is about ""I read the book before I read it."
99,77,>I read the book and thought I would check it out. But it didn't sound like it had anything to do with the actual question. What do you think of the book?
99,91,"No, this is not a bad book, but a good one."
99,98,____________________________________________________________________
99,3,"I’m not going to read the book or read it. It’s a good read. I read it, not the book."
99,9,"""I like how the title is the title of the book. It's about the fucking president's role in the terror attacks."""
99,18,The author of this article has a book about the Iraq War.
99,25,"I’m so sorry for bringing up the idea of a movie, and the word 'go to the theater' (and the movie 'going to the theater'); I figured it would be a good movie or a bad movie. But I also think it could be a good movie."
99,26,"I'm not sure what you're talking about, but I think the title of the book is ""in a good way."" Is this all the comments ""I can't believe there are all the things that will make people feel good if they do anything to prevent the spread of the virus."""
99,32,"""I love the book and the movie. The idea is to get the people to actually read the book before going to see the movie."""
99,45,"This sounds like a pretty nutty story, but I'm not sure I'd trust you in that one. I'd suggest you read The Godfather and the 'Guidelines' that were in the book and you're not looking for a specific one."
99,66,"[Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/edfu/news/articles/2007/2013/02/the-author-was-attempting-to-failure-to-tell-you-how-to-get-a-flash-on-a-button-to-get-afk-to-a-fuck-for-a-fuck-out-of-this-subreddit.html) in general, not necessarily."
99,69,"a sarcastic title, a good read, and a very well written book."
99,77,"I am very interested in the book. I don't know if I should read it but I read it. I have a book called I hate the president about how a guy was killed, a video, and a bunch of other good books about it. I read a book on the movie despite it being very funny. I think that if I read that book I would love the book, but I can't seem to read it because I want to learn about all the things that are incredibly important to me."
99,91,"A lot of people have been criticising the president for wearing a mask, though it is generally considered to be a form of counterproductive behavior. The book is very accurate based on what he has written and the authors' opinions. There is nothing wrong with it."
99,98,"I think the book is better than the movie he was referring to. It also gives a good overview of the book and gives a few background details on the president's role in the conflict he is in with the Iraq war, the country he is from and how it is spread."
99,3,"I sat down and typed down the paragraphs, and it sounded more like someone was going to ask the same questions. My first answer was I think this book is good but I'm also curious about it as well."
99,9,I can't do that shit.
99,18,I would not read this. I have read it.
99,25,"The book, ""Heavening the USA: President Donald J. Trump Must Take Off His Mask and Turn himself In oh and every day he doesn't people will die starting tonight i m a man of my word covid', ""r/ActionOfDeath doesn't have an article about what a mask is used in."" ("
99,26,You CAN'T.
99,32,"I just wanted to give you a chance to appreciate that he is wearing a mask, because I am not saying he must get the military shut down because the book is ""as good as the book""."
99,45,He sucked that rebuttal.
99,66,"I can't imagine anyone else saying anything as ""Hey. If I had to choose to see the movie, I would."""
99,69,"[In general, not necessarily. a pretty nutty story, but I’m not sure I’d trust you in that one."
99,77,It seems that the book is pretty accurate. It is also pretty accurate and that it is the best part of the book.
99,91,It is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
99,98,"""I thought the book was just a good book"""
99,3,"It seems that it's a good book, but it does need a bit of writing to be a good read. I don't know how many r/death people have actually said that."
99,9,[needs to read](https://www.reddit.com/r/edfu/news/articles/2007/2013/02/the-author-was-attempting-to-failure-to-tell-you-how-to-get-a-fuck-for-a-fuck-out-of-this-subreddit.html)
99,18,"“(i)’m just trying to point out how well the book is written. The author isn’t exactly a good author, I’m just suggesting that OP thinks the book is the best in the genre. [Is this [President] is wearing a mask...]”(https://www.reddit.com/r/edfu/news/articles/2007/2013/02/the-author-was-attempting-to-failure-to-_[President] [The book]"
99,25,"The book was written in a really, really well-informed way. It's very important to keep your ear shut and remind people of what you want to hear. I would also say that the book is great but does not really convey what's going on. It's a good book."
99,26,What do you think of the film's ending and what the movie would say?
99,32,I don't agree with the other replies but I'm happy you are enjoying the movie. I do understand the premise of the book and the context of it. You don't want to take it to heart if I'm wrong.
99,45,"I think it's better to go with the book. If you enjoy the book, go to the movie."
99,66,"So you're saying that ""she's going to die,"" and it's a good thing he's not a leader? No, no, no. No. But what a good book!"
99,69,"So, ""I love the book, I love the book and the movie."
99,77,"The Author is not a bad guy. He has a book called The Godfather about a guy who's going to die and put on his mask. The Book describes the situation and argues that the government is trying to prevent the spread of the virus by forcing him to wear a mask. The book also gives a good overview of the movie and gives a few background details on the president's role in the conflict with the Iraq war, the country he is from and how it is spread."
99,91,i agree with your other comments. You're too ignorant to take this as a true example of the true message of a book.
99,98,"This book is not just a good book, it's a good one. The author says that the book is better than the movie he was referring to."
