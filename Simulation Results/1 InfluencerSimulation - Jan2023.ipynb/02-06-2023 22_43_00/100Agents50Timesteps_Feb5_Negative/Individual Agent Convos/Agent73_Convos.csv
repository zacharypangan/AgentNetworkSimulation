88,73,i m going to say this about twitchcon and masks you can hate me if the state town doesn t have an mandates you can t get mad that an event doesn t not sure if sd has any mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask
90,73,yes the newest strain is soooooo contagious just bc they have a mask on their hands pics don t mean they re using it
94,73,i wear my mask when i m in public lawmaker who isn t wearing his mask in public says
88,73,"As a vaccinated person, I am not sure if we can have an absolute right to make sure we are not putting on a mask. But I would be mad if I were in a hospital where they don't want us doing anything."
90,73,Well dear the gun works the mask doesn t
94,73,How do I make them look?
88,73,"I've been in Colorado for over a decade, but I have not been to Twitchcon. The fact that you are not a vaccinate has nothing to do with your insurance policy, the fact that you have a CDC mandate to take you to the event does not mean they have mandates in your state."
90,73,"They don't seem to realize that the government is in the middle of a campaign to stop it. They are just saying, ""you know, they are doing this to stop the spread of a virus."""
94,73,That's pretty good. I'm going to go ahead and say 'I wear my mask when I am in public lawmaker who isn't wearing his mask in public says i wear my mask when i m in public lawmaker who isn't wearing his mask in public says i wear my mask when i m in public lawmaker who isn't wearing his mask in public says i wear my mask when i m in public lawmaker who isn't wearing his mask in public says i wear my mask when i m in public law
88,73,"A mask is a mask you don't need. It's the easiest and fastest way to get vaccinated. It's not just that people wear them, it's that people get more info about it than if they had to wear a mask. Vaccines aren't that easy to get vaccinated, they're too difficult to get a vaccination. The thing you don't understand is how the people you are talking about are calling it bad and I'm not sure what the person who said, but they are not being that stupid in the video"
90,73,"I think if they don't get shot, they are getting caught."
94,73,I think we should wear the same mask every time someone else wants to wear a mask. I can't believe this has never been done.
88,73,I don't get why people say they should not have to go to a vaccine event. This is about a non-existent health issue.
90,73,So the issue of a mask is no longer a government issue? That's why the government has made it a legal issue for you to buy a masked mask in public?
94,73,This isn't a legal problem but it's actually one of the reasons the government has been able to prevent the spread of a virus.
88,73,I'm not sure if the movie is on tv but it seems to be a pretty good movie.
90,73,"I'm not a doctor, I'm a drug dealer."
94,73,The FBI has a big influence on the government. They have a great influence. You just need to get yourself the CDC and CDC's support.
88,73,"I don't know if they are actually right. However, I have heard this before and I'm going to have to tell you a little about the movie as well."
90,73,"""As a public health expert I can say this as a hugely important fact: You're gonna have to watch this movie again."""
94,73,It's pretty cool to think about that.
88,73,What kind of vaccines are you unsure about?
90,73,I love that the movie's the one with the guy on the camera who wore a mask a few years ago.
94,73,"This is about the problems we're trying to solve, but the answers I've gotten to the most directly are: What if someone tells me, ""I'm a man who does not wear my mask when I'm in public lawmaker who isn't wearing his mask in public says "", ""How do I make them look?"", ""That's pretty good. I'm going to go ahead and say 'I wear my mask when I am in public lawmaker who isn't wearing his mask in public law, """
88,73,"I think a lot of people are just trying to justify what the CDC is doing, as a major political issue."
90,73,The movie that's been on Netflix for a few years is based on my own research.
94,73,I think it's pretty cool that you don't like the idea of it.
88,73,It's pretty ridiculous to be called the best way to prevent TB/STIs and it makes you think the people who have a history of having them in their health are actually really ill or dying. I'm saying the mask thing makes sense and it will be used to stop it.
90,73,"I'm gonna make a video for a friend in the US and tell her how it's awful that she has to go to the library or even buy a masked mask for her husband, because I am an expert in a public health field."
94,73,"I have a case for a false pretense. I know that it's the first time I've seen a false pretense. It's really cool that you think I don't like the idea of it. But it's not like it's something people really like, so it's not that I'm sure it is."
88,73,"You're just making a joke. Basically, I'm just giving a few words to you."
90,73,"Well, in my book you are trying to figure out how to make a movie without a mask that doesn't go well with your head."
94,73,"This is about the problems we're trying to solve, but the answers I've gotten to the most directly are:"
88,73,This is the correct subreddit. The best part of the story is it doesn't matter what it says. The article suggests that I'm an idiot and that the CDC doesn't care about my health. They know it's about preventing TB/STIs and don't want to tell the world I'm an idiot or the people I know do it.
90,73,"What? If they are trying to stop the spread, why are they trying to prevent it from spreading? If the ACA and ACA alone are a reversible disease, then it isn't working. It is not working or a righteous thing to do. It's not about the ACA or the ACA itself. It isn't about the virus, it is about the vaccine."
94,73,I can't imagine how it would look if people started wearing masks in public or even just when they were working with someone else? I mean I guess that's not the type of issue that could be resolved by a little humor.
88,73,I'm the biggest sailor...
90,73,I am glad the guy isn't being sarcastic about the movie and that it's not good for the US health care system.
94,73,"""I want to tell people the truth that they are wearing a mask in public, and I want to inform them that I am wearing a mask at work and that I am wearing a mask in public."""
88,73,I don't know if it's a joke or a joke. But I think a few words to you is the right way to look at it. I just think it's a joke and there's just too much information. Vaccines are the best way to prevent TB/STIs. Vaccines are the best way to stop the spread of a virus.
90,73,"I think we all know what it means to be in the US. If that means ""We are just gonna have to get a mask on the girl."" the whole thing seems to be blaming 'police' and people having no interest in what that means."
94,73,"So we're trying to fix the virus problem. The question is: are we going to fix it? Probably not. Obviously we should not be able to stop it. We need to stop being a lie, and stop the NSA from doing anything good."
88,73,"No, it's not. It's not. The CDC has no real reason to care about a situation like this. There's nothing wrong with it."
90,73,You mean the ACA or ACA alone?
94,73,I think the best way to help reduce the chances of people getting infected is by putting a small amount of alcohol in your mouth.
88,73,"The movie I watch is ""The Matrix."" It's a comedy. It's really funny."
90,73,"It's hard to tell what's in the book, though."
94,73,"I volunteered for a program called 'Pure Public Health' and was told that the CDC and CDC must put pressure on anyone with a virus to change their behaviors and practices. This is a very large, very small group. Apparently a lot of people with a virus are very young and have very high self esteem and can't cope with the stigma of wearing their masks in a public office. They will likely get squirmed up in the mouth if they don't take the risk of becoming a virulent disease on the job,"
88,73,My dad and I went to Twitchcon together when I was a kid. We got to know each other very well and we went to various events and it was the best part. We made the decision on our own. But the problem was that we never had a choice and opted out over health issues. We couldn't even afford to go to the events.
90,73,"I was reading the book, and I didn't read the book. I'd go on to say that the movie is really bad."
94,73,I think it's pretty cool that you think you don't like the idea of it. I know that it's pretty cool that you think it's pretty cool that you don't like the idea of it. But I don't think it's cool that you think that's pretty cool.
88,73,I'm not sure how you like to say this but the CDC does not have a right to do it. I like to think that the CDC can and should do something about it.
90,73,"Well, i'm gonna be the one who posts these comments. I've heard some comments that might be interesting to a lot of people. I've heard people mention the ACA and all the other medical insurance policies in the past (it's not just the insurance) that have been around for years."
94,73,"The NSA is not an authority, they are not a government. This is very different than the government’s ability to control the public, and what they do to help prevent people with a virus from being infected, without any government authority."
88,73,I'm just giving you a few words to you.
90,73,"...because the movie is so sexist, cynical and stupid, it's hilarious The movie is awful. I enjoy watching it as a good example of how the Obama administration is treating all Americans."
94,73,"It's not about the NSA. It's about the FBI, and it's not about the CDC."
88,73,"What happened with the CDC? How did they handle this, and why did they do it?"
90,73,The movie is a great example of how the Obama Administration is treating all Americans. I enjoy watching it as a good example of how the Obama Administration is treating all Americans.
94,73,"Why not all the other comments in this sub stating the CIA is responsible for people's lives? If we waited for the CIA to do this, they would make a lot of money off of it."
88,73,I'm just saying that the CDC has a duty to address the issue. The idea of getting vaccinated is what the CDC is doing. CDC has a duty to treat people with diseases that are potentially potentially serious. If you have a serious health issue you have to discuss it with a doctor or a health professional.
90,73,>I enjoy watching it as a good example of how the Obama Administration is treating all Americans.
94,73,CIA is not the CIA. CIA has no remorse for being a government. They are an independent organization.
88,73,It's not just that people wear masks. It's that people aren't actually getting vaccinated. Vaccines are not health issues. Vaccines and STIs are not the same thing. Vaccines and STIs are not health issues. Vaccines and STIs are not the same thing.
90,73,"I'm so glad I wasn't the one to say what I thought the guy said, it's funny I'm not a doctor, I'm a drug dealer."
94,73,"> ""I think we should wear the same mask every time someone else wants to wear a mask. I can't believe this has never been done."""
88,73,"It's a really good movie, a funny one and a great one. I'm not the most stupid person in the world."
90,73,"> The entire movie is a prank about Obama, and not about the ACA."
94,73,CIA does not have any control over public health.
88,73,"I'm sure this is a pretty good reason to avoid vaccination as well. Vaccines are a huge part of vaccination policies in America, but there's a huge gap between people getting the vaccine in a country without a healthcare system and people who don't."
90,73,"I don't understand why anyone would do that, and it's a very dangerous and stupid move for all of the people that have been caught."
94,73,"""I can't imagine how it would look if people started wearing a mask in public or even just when they were working with someone else."""
88,73,Vaccines are the best way to stop the spread of a virus. You need to go to the CDC and be vaccinated. Vaccines are not a health issue.
90,73,"The ACA is not a prank, but a prank. If it isn't implemented in time, then it isn't working."
94,73,"A lot of people don't even realize that masks are in the public eye, nor are they even wearing them in public, even when it isn't their job."
88,73,I can't imagine the time it would have taken them that long to realize that they are a medical problem and the situation would be different if the vaccines are a health issue and the public doesn't want to see that.
90,73,What the president is trying to do is do things to stop people getting sick. The act of doing things to stop people from getting sick is not the correct course of action.
94,73,The US government has absolutely no obligation to control the public. There is no obligation to control them if you don't do it. You should just get yourself the CDC and CDC's support.
88,73,"In my experience, people who want to be protected don't want to wear masks. They want to be vaccinated, and they have to get in there and talk to a doctor. This would be a prank. The people who don't want to get vaccinated should not wear a mask."
90,73,The whole thing seems to be blaming 'police' and people having no interest in what that means.''
94,73,There is a problem. Most people who aren't the CDC aren't on the same page as us. They can't control us. They can't help us. That's their problem. The issue is whether or not the CDC can control us. You can't do anything about it. You need to try.
88,73,"It was a prank, they are still trying to stop the spread of the disease."
90,73,It's a prank. It is not a prank. It is a campaign message.
94,73,"I'm really, really sorry that someone hasn't been able to do this. This is so incredibly unfortunate."
88,73,"The best part is it's a good movie, a funny one and a great one."
90,73,I really think it's a prank.
94,73,I'm sorry to say that there is a lot of misinformation here. It seems like the CIA is trying to deceive the public into believing that it's a good idea. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
88,73,"The best part is it is a good movie, a funny one and a great one."
90,73,"""There is a bunch of pranks and tricks happening about it."
94,73,"I agree with many of the other statements you've given. But I don't think this is what I would think. This isn't something I would want to do, and I don't think anyone would want to do this."
88,73,I thought this was the best part of it.
90,73,"It's pretty obvious, but the guy did a good job explaining how the ACA works, including what it's about."
94,73,A very good reason to prevent a virus from being spread is by being properly dressed.
88,73,"The CDC doesn't have the authority to do anything, they do. It has a duty to prevent the spread of diseases. The CDC is doing something, that they can do, but it's not going to stop it. It's going to stop it. It is going to stop it. I can't imagine how they will treat people who aren't being vaccinated. It is going to stop it."
90,73,"In my opinion, the issue isn't about the ACA, but rather the ACA alone."
94,73,"A lot of people don't realize that masks are in the public eye, nor are they even wearing them in public, even when it isn't their job."
88,73,"That is exactly what I'm getting at. You're making a joke and saying it's just a prank. I don't think the point is to be completely overbearing, but there's nothing wrong with it."
90,73,You're a prankster.
94,73,"[A lot of people don't realize that masks are in the public eye, nor are they even wearing them in public, even when it isn't their job. Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks."
88,73,>The best part is it doesn't matter what it says.
90,73,Why would a woman buy a mask in the first place?
94,73,""" I think ''I wear a mask whenever i am in public lawmaker who isn't wearing his mask in public says i wear my mask when i am in public lawmaker who isn't wearing his mask in public says i wear my mask when i m in public law"
88,73,Vaccines are not a health issue.
90,73,"""...I'm glad the guy isn't being sarcastic about the movie and that it's not good for the US health system."""
94,73,I've only ever shaved my head after the accident in a public place.
88,73,So you're saying that the CDC is not treating you with a vaccine.
90,73,"I read about the movie, he said that in his book."
94,73,"Unless you’re just a teenager, I think that you don’t have the same knowledge as everyone else."
88,73,""", ""Masked a guy who is wearing a mask to prevent TB/STIs."""

94,73,"Vaccination is not a government issue, and if you don't have a choice but to avoid it, you should get vaccinated if you can."
88,73,"I'm not gonna be able to see you until I look at this, but I'll be able to give you a few ideas about what makes you happy about that."
90,73,This is how you get your karma in the news.
94,73,"Vaccination is not a government issue, but an individual's stance on a topic that is important in this context. There is no need to impose a government rule. It is part of the ""cannot"" clause."
88,73,...I think the best part of the story is it doesn't matter what it says.
90,73,I think this movie is the best movie I've ever seen and that's why I like it.
94,73,I'd have a pretty high opinion on this. I'm a bit more of a conspiracy theorist than I'd be on the topic of terrorism.
88,73,The best part is that I think the CDC needs to fix the problem.
90,73,I don't know what I'm talking about but I've read that the ACA is about the government and is used as a prank.
94,73,">We need to stop being a lie, and stop the CIA from doing anything good."
88,73,"I'm a vaccinated person, and I've never worn a mask. I was in the hospital with people who needed to come to the party or to do anything about it. The people were sick and dying. I was wearing a mask to get vaccinated. I'm in the hospital and no one knows what the CDC means. That's what's happening."
90,73,The film seems to be a good example of how the government is working on the ACA. I have read some of these comments.
94,73,">They don't have any obligation to control the public. They can't control them if you don't do it. You should just get yourself the CDC and CDC's support."""
88,73,"Yes, they are trying to stop the spread of the virus in the U.S. It is not a health issue and that is not a prank."
90,73,"So, a prankster is saying that the world's going to need a bit more attention from the US government than the current one? Or is it just the one guy who threw a mask at him based on his own research? I'm so curious."
94,73,"I've always been told that it's not a government issue. You can go a bit further and ask yourself, is that it's a government issue?"
88,73,"I mean, this CDC is a good thing and not a bad thing, but they don't want to say anything. The fact that people aren't getting vaccinated is a really big rip off."
90,73,"The fact that it's about the ACA is a bit misleading. The fact that the ACA has not been rolled out and is reversible means that the ACA has never actually been implemented. It's basically saying that all the anti-vaccine policies in the ACA are just pranks. But since the ACA was passed in 2009, it's been reversible for a number of years, including a few."
94,73,"There are a lot of good things about them, and they can be good for us, but we're not getting good at them."
88,73,"The best part is what you're saying. ""The only thing that makes me think that the CDC isn't doing a good job of preventing the spread of a virus is that the people who don't want to get vaccinated aren't getting vaccinated. They aren't really doing anything about it."""
90,73,"i see people asking these questions a lot, if that's the case. Isn't it really because I'm a huge ObamaCare fan, so I understand why it's a prank, but I'm not a big ObamaCare fan. I see people asking these questions a lot, if that's the case."
94,73,Vaccination is not a government issue. Vaccination is not a government issue.
88,73,I've seen this movie multiple times. I know it's a joke. I also know it's a rip off. I'm not sure how people get to say that people are stupid or the most stupid person in the world.
90,73,The ACA is a prank.
94,73,Is there a CDC in a particular country that isn't part of the United States Government?
88,73,>I think it's pretty ridiculous to be called the best way to prevent TB/STIs and it makes you think the people who have a history of having them in their health are actually really ill or dying.
90,73,"CANNOTANSWER: We know the ACA, but not the ACA. That's the problem. I'm a big Obamacare fan, and I really feel fucking bad for the US. Sadly, a lot of our issues are so obvious and inconsiderate. But I feel fucking bad for your country, that you need to start learning more about your health care. I'm sorry, but what you have to tell me is I can't understand the truth. It seems that some people don't get it. So the ACA is not"
94,73,Vaccination is not a government issue. It's a government issue. It's not a government issue. Vaccination is not a government issue. The CDC and CIA are not independent entities. The CDC and CIA are not independent entities. The CDC and CIA are not independent entities.
88,73,Vaccination is a good option but it doesn't guarantee a cure for HIV/AIDS and the whole issue of TB/STIs is unavoidable.
90,73,Is the idea of the ACA a prank? No.
94,73,"I was asked about the potential risk and i think that a lot of the first points were a bit misinformed. I don't think any of these statements are particularly helpful. I don't think I've found any more interesting, but I do think the most common, and most common, way that this is being interpreted is as:"
88,73,"""I think I'm the best kind of person in the world."""
90,73,">I'm not a doctor, I'm a drug dealer."
94,73,This is where most of the things I've gotten to most specifically are.
88,73,I think that's the part that is so stupid and messes with the CDC that it's gonna be in a pretty good place.
90,73,"I like the film. I don't know the people that watch it, but this is a bit cynical and cheesy."
94,73,"I think the problem is that the public has no moral obligation to wear masks because they are dangerous and are not intended to be worn in public places. I think it's really fucked up for them to be able to wear a mask when someone is not allowed to work in the public sector and because of this it's not a safe place to wear them, and it's not a good idea for the public. The government is a big pawn on public health and they can't do anything to stop it. But the government can't control the public"
88,73,"This is a very important discussion that people seem to have in the past, and it is a common misunderstanding that the CDC is trying to prevent the spread of AIDS. I don't know about it, but the guy with the mask who was on the date and was with the other person in the event was very upset and got in trouble for doing a CDC job with the government, which is why the CDC isn't doing it."

94,73,It’s one of the very few things that has actually been proven that a virus is the same as a mask in the public eye. The fact that it’s a mask doesn’t make it an issue.
88,73,Vaccines and STIs are not health issues. They are not health issues. They are not health issues. The CDC has no right to say anything. This is just a prank.
90,73,"a prankster can be a prankster because it's not about Obamacare or the ACA alone, it's about the ACA."
94,73,I think the best way to prevent people from getting infected is to wear a mask.
