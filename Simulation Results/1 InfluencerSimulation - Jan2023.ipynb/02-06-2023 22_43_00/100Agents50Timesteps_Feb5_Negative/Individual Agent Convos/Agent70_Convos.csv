78,70,There are other signs of this:
80,70,Honestly you don't need to be on the team but to be in the position to be able to wear a mask can make a huge difference. It's a big difference but only if you're going to be wearing it professionally.
93,70,Are you sure that's true?

70,7,You are being a troll. You can't help but think about the troll.
70,8,That's not what the article is about.
70,15,A government employee allegedly has a mask in her car for protection against the spread of a virus.
70,17,There is an upcoming documentary on [Rogers of the Past starring Richard Branson](http://relationships.dailystarships.org/emotional_projection/drama-the-porn-shelf) where a woman wears a mask and has a hard time breathing. It focuses on the two aspects of the movie.
70,23,"That's not what the article was supposed to say. It's what people in the US are making the point that I am wrong. That's what the article says, you can't really see a difference. But there is a difference between wearing a mask outside and wearing a mask in your car, I am sure."

70,47,"I don't like the idea of the government being like this, I'm going to have to say it..."
70,48,The story is based on the idea that wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
70,51,Wearing a mask outside or in your car alone your gullible and submissive not traits you want to project
70,69,"What's the point of having a mask if you don't have a doctor who is a doctor? I've never had a doctor. I don't think there's anything I've been able to wear outside or in my car. I've had to walk a few miles before and I always see my doctor when I'm driving around. But I know it doesn't matter what you do, the government is doing nothing to help."
72,70,He was just talking about the fact that the government is helping to prevent a virus from spreading. That is really just nonsense.
74,70,"I'm a young man and I have a hard time breathing with my mouth open. And while it does hurt, I get some of those screams from my dog in the rain."
78,70,"This is one of the most important things in the state in the past 30 years. A school in Delaware has one who can not wear a mask. If that school was an exception to the order, they cannot continue to hold the order."

93,70,"No, if you have the ability to choose to wear a mask in public, you should do so."
95,70,"The woman wears a mask to protect herself, the one she wears when she is sick. The woman wears a mask to protect herself."
100,70,He can eat anything but the stuff he wants and it doesn't mean he has to wear it and he cannot change his mask.
70,1,Is the fact that this movie was directed by a man who hated wearing a mask in a theater that makes you think of the movie as a joke?
70,7,"It is also an issue with the government and the health care system in general. I've seen this with a group of friends recently, including one of the parents of a young woman who has a hard time breathing a virus in her car."

70,17,The first part of this post was about an actual movie. It doesn't really add up to anything except that it's about a woman with a hard time breathing - but in the end the movie seems more like a film he is making.
70,23,"There's a funny movie on /r/rogersofthepast starring Richard Branson, ""Oh you dont like wearing a mask"" about a woman who wears a mask outside and in her car alone for protection against the spread of a virus."
70,39,It is a part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
70,47,"I know right now, but the article is about the woman and the government trying to stop the spread of a virus."
70,48,He was not really suggesting that a doctor can actually protect you. He was stating that the government was helping to stop the spread of a virus.
70,51,"Its a different rooster than the rooster, which is a real nerd film about a nerd."
70,69,Is wearing a mask part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus?
72,70,"'Oh man you should come to Georgia it s like people here think wearing a mask gives them covid there s so few', 'OP is a politician, not a legislator, not a doctor.'"
74,70,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
78,70,There are a couple of facts in this post that are pretty ridiculous.
80,70,I love football - there is nothing illegal about being on the team or playing on the internet. And what about the public health system?
93,70,"""I'm not against vacks mandates cuz i don't think i'll catch the cough i already had it i m against them cuz they ruin the economy get people fired and people should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force', ""Are you sure that's true?"", ""No, if you have the ability to choose to wear a mask in public, you should do so. The government can't force people to do what they want."
95,70,I thought this would be a pretty cool movie. You could have a bunch of jokes about the state of the nation.
100,70,"OP is not an expert in HIV/AIDS, and it is possible that people who don't like wearing a mask can't breathe."
70,1,"I've never seen this movie. I've never been in one, and that's just the way I like it. I just think it's great. I've seen it before, and I can't imagine it happening again. I've also never seen it in the movie, and I don't think I could take this nonsense and just put it in a non-fictional form. I wonder if people will think of it as a funny film."
70,7,"The video that gets posted is about this movie. I feel like it's over a jingle. If you want to find out more, please share."
70,8,"""""If you wear a mask in public, you should do so. The government can't force people to do what they want."""""""
70,15,"I'm gonna look up a movie about the government, I can tell you that a bunch of people like it."
70,17,I'm going to have to guess - this is an issue you would consider an issue.
70,23,"So, is it the same person that reads the article and is actually saying it is a joke?"
70,39,[Rogers of the Past](http://relationships.dailystarships.org/emotional_projection/drama-the-porn-shelf)
70,47,OP is not a lawyer. He's not a lawyer. Is he supposed to be a lawyer. Is he a politician?
70,48,He was telling a joke about how he wore a mask in the movie and how it would help in stopping a virus.
70,51,The movie seems like a film about a man who likes to talk about health issues in general.
70,69,They aren't helping the virus.
72,70,"I'm the one that makes up the fact that this isn't the case, but I think there's some truth in the way people are construing it:"
74,70,I can't believe that it's a thing.
78,70,I think it's just a prank.
80,70,I was at a CDC. The NSA did something about this (flashing a fad virus) and I'm surprised they didn't cite the link.
93,70,"I'm not against the ObamaCare Act, I'm against the ACA."
95,70,"It's definitely not as fun as the book, but the movie was a good reminder of the importance of wearing a mask to protect yourself."
100,70,It sounds like they're trying to naive and pathetic. They want to give them something to talk about. It's just this is how people react to these people in situations that are naive and pathetic. They feel like they're being a dick. You're being a dick. I am sorry to tell you that.
70,1,I'm just thinking about the fact that I've never seen this movie.
70,7,"I don't really understand the joke, I just like the way people are interpreting it. It was not funny. I just don't see how people will see it as a prank, but it would have been really funny if it wasn't a joke and didn't even need to be said. This is the exact reason why they have this attitude."
70,8,This is what the movie is about.
70,15,"i do not believe there are any laws or anything involving this thing that it isn't an issue. that is a prank. but, it's pretty easy to get slapped for it. I've seen a few, and it has no impact on my life."
70,17,i read about this in a book - it is on tv so i was in the movie.
70,23,">''If you wear a mask in public, you should do so. The government can't force people to do what they want."""""
70,39,There's no real way to know what you're getting into. Just a basic understanding of what a prank is.
70,47,"This is a good movie, and it's a pretty decent joke. It's one of those films where people get to tell the story of a guy who is not a lawyer, because he's not a lawyer, that's just a prank."
70,48,He has to do the best thing to do when you are around someone who is wearing a mask to protect them.
70,51,Why do you think this movie is so funny?
70,69,"IANAL, but I'm a lawyer so I'm fairly certain OP read the article and thought ""You should wear a mask in your car alone your gullible and submissive not traits you want to project."""

74,70,I believe it's the mask people wear that's getting infected.
78,70,"Yes, the mask law is a prank, but I think this is a joke."
80,70,"It's a violation of the anti-virus law. Wearing a mask does not protect against a virus (you aren't allowed to wear it in any other way). The NSA is doing everything for national security, and the government doesn't have to enforce anti-virus laws."
93,70,This is very interesting and the question is why would a bunch of people have to agree to repeal the ACA?
95,70,A good reason why I liked this movie.
100,70,"I had to walk out of the house to go to the ER for the first day because I didn't like it. And after a week, I was feeling very sick and vomiting."

70,39,"I have a friend who wears a mask and she can tell her kids. She tells them that because he is wearing a mask, and they're going to want to do it, they can do it, but no one else would be able to do it."
70,47,"Its not a prank at all. You're not being a dick or anything, and people are using this as an excuse to attack you."

70,51,There's no real way to know what you're getting into. Just a basic understanding of what a prank is.
70,69,I didn't see the title until after the movie. I was not the only one who noticed this.
72,70,ahh ahhhh ok
74,70,"I've always known there's something to be said that's a joke, and I've never heard that phrase before."
78,70,[Little bit of trivia about wearing a mask:
80,70,"I believe that the NSA is trying to keep the government's role in the public health system from being disrupted. It's just a big fad, if not a legitimate one. It's pretty simple."
93,70,This is a great example of A tyrant who wants to get rid of any form of health care. The President is a tyrant. It’s very interesting. I would like to say that the president is a tyrant who wants to get rid of any form of health care.
95,70,"The movie is titled 'I'm a man,' and it was published in 2003. It has a sequel. It's the best movie ever. The movie is actually actually actually actually a satire of an 'advice' movie where the government decides whether to provide a medical protective gear that protects you from viral infections."
100,70,"This is a ridiculous response. What would it matter if you said, ""But if you wear a mask, how can I breathe without it?"""
70,1,"It's about an ad litem campaign against the government putting on a mask to protect children, a shitload of drugs and a lot of other stuff."
70,7,A prank with a jingle is not just a prank. It's not a joke. It's the simplest way to get a jingle... or even a joke. It's a prank.
70,8,I don't understand the sarcasm. I was trying to guess what it was about the guy who did it and was trying to prank him. He didn't really realize this was a prank. He had to show me that he was just really a fucking fool.
70,15,"Is it an advertisement for the new movie called ""The Mask of the Past""?"
70,17,"So, if you were wearing a mask outside or in your car alone, you wouldn't be being a prank? You're wearing a mask because you're uncomfortable wearing it in a public place and you're being an ad hominem. This is a prank based on your innate curiosity about the subject. It's not a prank, it's a joke."
70,23,"You can prank the NSA, but it has been pretty blatantly pranked, and it's only in the last 10 years that I've seen it portrayed properly."
70,39,The thing about wearing a mask is that the government is in no position to provide any protection for your life. I think a lot of people are going to take this as an excuse. But it's not like there's a joke in there.
70,47,I've always wondered why a man would be in a position to be able to prank his partner or something like that. And now he is saying that his masks are too big to use.
70,48,...And there's no real way to know what you're getting into. Just a basic understanding of what a prank is.
70,51,"I'm wearing a mask, not a helmet - I'm wearing a mask."
70,69,"Until I read the article I didn't see anything that relates to the movie: ''What's the point of wearing a mask if you don't have a doctor who is a doctor.

I've had to walk a few miles before and I always see my doctor when"
72,70,"I think the only way to keep a joke from making a real point about the government is to actually show how much time it takes. That way the joke can be used to create further and more powerful racial or cultural conflicts, resulting in a higher number of fake news stories and attacks. I don't know if this is the only time that I've heard of someone using a mask as an excuse to put out fake news, but I would assume that it's a simple way of making a joke and not a real problem."

It's not like he had a AIDS diagnosis and she didn't know if the doctors were the ones to diagnose it. The doctors only told him because of his condition and there's nothing to blame, but you can't know"

70,7,You know this is the only part of this subreddit that is not going to be downvoted because it's already downvoted because it's only one sentence - it's going to be the most downvoted version of this comment that I've ever heard. I have a hard time believing he was a joke.

70,39,RA was on that hat. He did a bunch of pranks. RA didn't want to go on that hat and made it a prank. The pranks were just a prank that the people that had done it did not want to do. RA wasn't going to do it because the government was in no position to prevent HIV. He was going to get raped and he wasn't going to put up a fight to stop HIV.
70,47,"It is a prank, it is a joke because it's intended to address the problem of HIV, and it's intended to address the problem of HIV. It is not a joke because it doesn't address the problem of HIV."

70,69,He didn't say anything to anyone denying that his stance is false.
72,70,"It was about the president that actually gave the hat to his friend, and he was pretty impressed with it, so I think it's just a joke."
74,70,The hat is a prank because he was in a movie about the ACA. He said he was in it and he was a fan of the movie.
78,70,"It is a joke. It addresses the problem of AIDS, but it doesn't address the problem of AIDS."
80,70,"I don't think this is actually the question. The question at hand. The problem here isn't that the US isn't doing what is deemed ""bad"" to people."
93,70,CANNOTANSWER'S a political troll.
95,70,I think this one is really good  it's kind of funny  it's about a prankster who tries to make a prank out of a book.
100,70,CANNOTANSWER:
70,1,I don't know much about r/police but the fact that it's a movie that's about a prankster in a movie is not that funny.

70,48,It is not a prank. It is a joke. It isn't a joke because it's intended to address the problem of AIDS. It is not a joke because it doesn't address the problem of AIDS. It isn't a joke because it doesn't address the problem of HIV.
70,51,"The article states that RA was in the movie about the ACA. It was about the president that actually gave the hat to his friend, and he was pretty impressed with it."

72,70,It's an incredibly popular hat.
74,70,"If he says it's a prank, then it's a joke. A hat doesn't have to be about the government, but it's not about the government's policies or procedures. It's a joke about people who say they like wearing masks. If a person does like wearing a hat, they're not going to like it."
78,70,It would have been a joke to try to make the president think it is a joke.
80,70,Nope. The NSA is not working to stop the spread of a virus.

70,17,What are you trying to say?
70,23,That was pretty bad news for everyone involved.
70,39,I think that's the point of the movie. They are in no position to address the problem of HIV. They haven't done anything to stop it. They haven't done anything. There's nothing to do with a movie about the ACA. I don't think it's a joke because the CIA is in no position to address the problem of HIV.
70,47,I don't think this is a prank. What's funny is that people get a lot of negative responses and get caught up in the stupid stuff.
70,48,I think the NSA is trying to stop people from getting the virus.
70,51,I don't understand how someone who actually goes to see the movie isn't going to know what the prank is about.
70,69,"No, because the guy in the movie was a doctor, and he tried to make the CIA look evil, but he was a prankster who actually pranks himself. He didn't even try to make the CIA look bad in the movie."
72,70,I think the whole idea of a hat is dangerous isn't a good idea.
74,70,"I had this happen to me. I have a few people that are actually in the movie, and I do like them, but I don't find them funny. I like them. I can't say that I'd like to see a movie. I don't think I'd have a choice."

70,8,It's not the ACA that isn't a joke.

70,47,It's a joke because it's intended to address the problem of HIV. It sounds like the CDC has the resources to fix it. It doesn't. It doesn't. It doesn't. The ACA isn't intended to address the problem of HIV. It's a joke because it's intended to address the problem of HIV.
