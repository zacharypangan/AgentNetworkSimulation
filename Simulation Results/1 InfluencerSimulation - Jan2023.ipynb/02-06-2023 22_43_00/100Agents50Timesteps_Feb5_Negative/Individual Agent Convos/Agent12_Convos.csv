12,7,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
12,9,That s why you should be wearing a mask.
13,12,The state of Utah is notorious for being a state of oblivion. You've never heard of that.
16,12,Wearing a mask when a doctor doesn't take care of the disease is one of the first things that people do when they feel safe.
17,12,Wearing a mask to protect yourself is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
22,12,"Why are the people wearing masks so popular here in the US? There's a really really good movie based on this, and there's a lot of hype about the fact that they actually work to stop the spread of the virus. I haven't seen a single video of that and I know that's pretty crazy to me"
27,12,"The people who wear the mask don't get their masks off, but they're trying to make it illegal, because they are not wearing a mask. They just aren't doing it a big favor."
35,12,So you are wearing a mask to protect yourself from a virus? Are you saying it is a hard time breathing?
46,12,This makes me wish we could all have that sarcasm in our hearts
55,12,"I wear a mask at concerts, but the only thing I wear while in the public space is masks and helmets."
56,12,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.says the woman that wears the mask to protect herself
62,12,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
65,12,"It's because a mask helps prevent the spread of a virus, not because of it."
66,12,It seems he is being completely disrespectful and that's just not the way to do it.
72,12,> I m not against vacks mandates cuz they ruin the economy get people fired and people should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force
78,12,I was there. I went to the school and got a new mask and the school didn't offer them a gift.
88,12,ahh i see a snob on twitchcon is a person who was vaccinated with boosters
90,12,"We use a mask to catch viruses on hands and fingers, to keep from spread to hands. It is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
93,12,[NAME] argues that they are not the ones who are in power.
12,7,So they say they are using the mask to prevent the spread of the virus.
12,9,I had a girl who had a virus on her hand in school. It was super sick and it went from her mother to me...
13,12,This is something I would not be interested in seeing.
16,12,I don't really think you understand the context. The guy who doesn't have a mask in his office doesn't want to be the one exposing them to a virus in a medical setting. The guy who gets infected by a virus is a guy with the mask.
17,12,> We have been working for Donald Trump for about three years. He is already in his 20s and in his 40s. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of a virus. Please wear masks.
22,12,"I'd like to bring up that I can't wear a mask because a few days later my wife was doing just that. I mean a lot of other people are going to wear them, and the idea of the government preventing people from flying is pretty much the same."
27,12,The mask is not the thing that can make your breath come out of your head. It is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
35,12,"I m not going to start talking about the topic of wearing a mask, but I am willing to bet a little bit more on that and how the people who wear it are too scared of it."
46,12,"This has nothing to do with being a person. This is about the government supplying vaccination, not the citizen. It should be pretty easy."
55,12,"There are many things to be said for wearing a mask, including a safety blanket, but the mask is the most important. It isn't a mask that you wear in public (you can't do it in public) or a helmet, so it doesn't really matter."
56,12,I think if the federal government banned all vaccinations in the states? It seems that the government has done some work for them in this country. Is this a thing?
62,12,I don't think any of this is true. I'm a Vermontian. And I am going to be very close to you. I can't imagine being on a plane without a mask to prevent something like that.
65,12,"You don't have to wear a mask or get the jab if you don't want to be covered. You can't put a mask on a person, you're paying for the jab."
66,12,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
72,12,What I feel is most important about the current government is that people with a mask can not wear a mask. And they do not have to wear a mask to get into the office.
78,12,I guess there aren't enough people who could care less what you say about the school or the people they represent.
88,12,"Yes, it is a good way to prevent TB and STIs, so just wear a mask and see if it is a good idea."
90,12,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
93,12,The government can choose to put people on a mask. But it would be more effective to have people stop assuming that people would be allowed to.
12,7,There is an interesting fact I read recently in r/drugcontrol. It was not just people who said the newest strain is soooooo contagious just because they have a mask on their hands pics don't mean they re using it. It was people who said the vaccine is not effective and they are now worried about it. That is why he did not wear a mask.
12,9,The problem with the federal government is that there aren't many laws that say that people in the country have to wear masks and are not allowed to be on the planes. It's not like there aren't many laws to be written by the government for anyone not wearing a mask.
13,12,"I've heard that the US government wants people to wear a mask that makes them feel more comfortable to their parents and their kids in order to stay safe. In my state, the government is the only one that sat in that position for 10 years, or so."
16,12,"IANAL. I have been there. It was a day I would be able to talk to a health professional about the situation. It was a very important decision, and I would have the courage to start thinking about it. It wasn't until recently that I was told about the problem that the CDC started tackling it because they were really worried about it being harmed. I did."
17,12,"So when you are in high school, you're doing something for the kids and getting vaccinations?"

27,12,"This thread is about ""fucking the government"" right now, not ""doing it a big favor""."
35,12,"I don't have to be sure, but you said I don't like wearing a mask to protect myself."
46,12,Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of a virus. Please wear masks.
55,12,It was a bad comment.
56,12,I'm confused. How exactly did you do this?
62,12,"There's a thing called ""Victim Protection"". It helps keep people out of the ""viral war"". If you want to stop a virus from spreading, wear it in public, and never ever use a mask."
65,12,"You don't have to wear a mask if you don't want to be covered. You can't put a mask on a person, you're paying for the jab."
66,12,"It's not a mask. A mask is a shield. A mask is not a shield, it's an anti-virus device. The government is vetoing anti-virus laws."
72,12,/u/pwww1ewdjsybnozbd? They are so wrong. They should be made to go back to their homes.
78,12,The school I was at did not have the ability to take on any responsibility. I was the mascot. They used it.
88,12,"I don't think I understand why people seem to think that there is something wrong with the ""dumbness"" of the person who said the ""Dumbness"" is the reason people don't want to wear a mask, because there is some reason why people don't think this is an important part of their healthcare."
90,12,"In America, the government has a duty to prevent AIDS, and to make it known to all people in the world that it is contagious and doesn't have a cure. And that's why you need a mask, because it is for the people who can't pick it up and have to wear it. That is why the CDC is doing it."
93,12,i think people have a problem with the government but they also have a problem with the government.
12,7,[NAME] and [NAME] are the only two people who are not able to take responsibility for AIDS.
12,9,"... and he said he wanted the kids to take care of themselves and get their children vaccines, but not to keep them at a certain age. The government didn't have a duty to prevent HIV."
13,12,I don't get why people think that it's so bad. I'm not sure why you're getting this downvoted.
16,12,"The first thing they did when i walked into a public place was to put a mask on, then put it on a guy who was sick and who had a virus. It was a horrible thing to do."
17,12,"Getting vaccines is not a crime. It is a crime, and they are not being enforced."
22,12,It's a joke. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I don't understand how this is such a common phrase unless it has something to do with the person in the video?
27,12,"It is illegal, the mask makes you smell like blood. You can't feel it because it's a odor that comes out when you're wearing it. The government is not doing this."
35,12,This is the third time I've gotten this kind of sarcasm in a comment.
46,12,CANNOTANSWER:
55,12,I can't believe there's a lot of people that think that people have a right to wear masks but I don't think that's how it's pronounced.
56,12,[I m also confused. How exactly did you do this? I am very curious as to why they are doing the ACA as part of the measures deployed by the government.
62,12,I'm an AIDS and a virus advocate. I don't think I've ever been in a situation where I don't wear masks or use them.
65,12,"I'm pretty sure that the school's governing authority is based on a principle that if it doesn't fit the law, it should have a ""discharge"" to do so."
66,12,A hoodie. I don't think that's a shield.
72,12,"The article mentions that this is an issue not in itself, but in fact that the government is actually attempting to stop the spread of the virus."
78,12,There are a lot of things on the internet I would like to read. This is something the FDA could not seem to solve. I feel as though it would be a waste of time and effort to implement in their eyes.
88,12,"I'm a CDC member and if they had any information about this, they would be able to put you on the map."
90,12,"My mom did a bit of research about the situation. When I had to wear a mask and I got sick, she didn't have the necessary equipment for it, because I couldn't get the infection in her hands. Eventually, she got a shot but I couldn't use it. My father still wears a mask, so it's more of a medical mask than the medical one."
93,12,The President is opportunistic.
12,7,"If they say the ""false"" in the title, I think that it means people can't actually get them into a contract and get it through a doctor."
12,9,Almost everyone on this subreddit has the same notion that the government has no duty to prevent AIDS.
13,12,I'd also say that this isn't a good idea.
16,12,I have to admit that this guy has done what's best for him. I'm not a politician. I haven't been in public. I'm on a vacation and didn't take the time to pick up on a virus.
17,12,I think it is a bit ridiculous that the guy who wears a mask would get the vaccine and not get it.
22,12,"Why are the people wearing masks so popular here in the US? There's a really really good movie based on that, and there's a lot of hype about the fact that they actually work to stop the spread of a virus."
27,12,"It’s a big red flag, but this is the same shit in the U.S. (It’s a state.)"
35,12,"""This is the third time I've gotten this kind of sarcasm in a comment."""
46,12,CANNOTANSWER was referring to the government's commitment to stop the spread of a virus.
55,12,I'm very sorry he is a douchebag.
56,12,"I've read a LOT of anti-vaccine articles lately, but this particular one was a little off-putting. Whether you want to take any issue, or not, it's that a lot of people are misinformed about the ACA, and a lot of people are just misinformed about the ACA. You are essentially asking if they really care about this. They're not even going to get anything."
62,12,It's a question about the nature of public health care. You've already been put in this pathetic position if you don't go to the con without a mask. That's all the rest of your message.
65,12,I think people shouldn't feel bad about wearing masks. That's like being an 'all of the time' joke.
66,12,I am also not sure how I can respond to this.
72,12,It sounds like the government is going to take a very very dangerous approach to the SARS virus epidemic.
78,12,"The biggest problem is how many people wear masks, and when it happens, they die. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks."
88,12,This is a funny joke. I feel like some people are confused on the subject.
90,12,"I don't know the answers here, but your father owes the ACA to the government to prevent AIDS."
93,12,"The government has no power, and there is a vast majority of its population opposed to the ACA."
12,7,"Yes, but you're going to have to put the mask on. It's not a mask. It's a mask."
12,9,Almost everyone is saying this and I'm just glad that you're out of there. This ACA really is going to make me feel so uncomfortable.
13,12,a lot of people like this one.
16,12,"I am sure the message of the people is a'middle ground' for anyone who wants to go through with this kind of behavior. But it is a 'common joke' and if it makes you feel unsafe, I doubt you'll find a way to find it."
17,12,"I would be all ears. Like ""we need more people like Trump, so people don't take on the role of the president and i mean even if it is not possible to prevent any new violence. he would have been the greatest president ever. There is nothing to be ashamed of with this post. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of a virus. Please wear masks."
22,12,>Is this an example of a lack of proper protection? I don't think it's a big deal.
27,12,I am an American. A doctor who is a doctor.
35,12,"In the future unless someone gets sick and dies it may be worth noting that the CDC's response is ""I don't have to be sure, but you said I don't like wearing a mask to protect myself."""
46,12,">The problem is that there is no evidence of people getting vaccinated. That's why I am afraid that the government could've just done that instead. They need to put more pressure on the federal government to enforce ACA, not the ACA itself."
55,12,"No kidding. Vaccination, in the U.S., can be considered a sexist evil."
56,12,"The ACA was not supposed to be implemented but instead, it should have been adopted, which I agree with most of the other commenters."
62,12,"Yes I agree, I was being sarcastic and the person I was defending is a pretty sarcastic person, even if it's a joke. You know what, you didn't even notice, you were being very serious."
65,12,"Yes, it's funny, I don't."
66,12,I know what the joke is. But the fact that he is wearing a mask is a huge red flag for me.
72,12,I don't think that's a joke and it doesn't make sense.
78,12,Apparently this doesn't change anything about this. I don't think the mask is part of the problem. That's pretty normal.
88,12,The movie is funny because people are using the CDC to justify what is really a big deal to the guy describing. I'm not sure why this is funny but the guy is expressing what he thinks it is and that the CDC is not making it up. He just sounds a little disrespectful to the guy saying this because it's his CDC friend.
90,12,"My irrational reaction when I read the last line was ""... I mean, the only people who wanted to protect themselves were people who weren't really people."""
93,12,I think we need to go back to the basic point: What about the people who pushed for the ACA?
12,7,He is actually using the mask to prevent the spread of the virus.
12,9,I see no problem with having a mask on and not knowing what to say in case people start getting sick. I do have a mask on that tells me that this is very blatantly against the rules and that is the reason to wear one
13,12,There's actually a whole series of subs with the same titles.
16,12,"This was posted because a number of people wanted a ""Dumbest"" list but it didn't."
17,12,"Vaccination is a crime, and you can't just make fun of the government. It's not your job to make a joke, it's not your job to be a part of a conspiracy, but a piece of crap."
22,12,"A lot of these things are really 'good'in my book, and the quote is a little misleading and unhelpful."
27,12,"So what if I were the president of the US, I would wear a mask, and make the joke? I would go into the CDC to buy the ad and get a real life copy of a tv show that he's working on and not worrying about his health."
35,12,What does a person with an infection have that can be a problem?
46,12,"It's a bit of a ""cannotadian"" thing to do."
55,12,"""I have never done this but I've learned to put my mask on in public."""
56,12,We need a new generation of coaches that are able to understand the consequences of what they are doing. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
62,12,"It's the first thing I do, that I read."
65,12,"It's not a joke, it's the joke."
66,12,"The government is vetoing the ACA, which it seems to be doing no favors. I'm not a liberal, but I just don't have the time or resources to read much anymore and it's a bit jaded. But, this guy looks like a real bad guy."
72,12,>Is it okay for the president to wear a mask?
78,12,"It was written by the guy who wrote the movie ""The Mask Law"""
88,12,Vaccines do not have to be mandatory for anyone to travel outside of the country to work in health care.
90,12,"It's not exactly the only thing that can be described as ""relatively insane"" in this context. But I would think that the entire ""We want to be a doctor"" arc is really just ""the guy who was going to be a doctor."""
93,12,"People don't like to put on a mask. The government doesn't like the mask. He's an opportunistic dictator, and that's just the basis for his policies."
12,7,> I see no problem with having a mask on and not knowing what to say in case people start getting sick. I do have a mask on that tells me that this is very blatantly against the rules and that is the reason to wear one
12,9,I would get a bunch of posters to put on a mask in a show that doesn't help stop the virus from spreading. I'm a little worried that the government will make up this crap and it will come out in a few months.
13,12,It's a joke.
16,12,I'd tell a Senator that this is a joke based on my current position. He's a skeptic.
17,12,">If I were in the US I'd have a little more experience than the other members of the US government."""
22,12,The first thing I thought about was 'Does it get me in trouble?' (and was a little confused because it's not on wikipedia)
27,12,"The government isn't responsible for the spread of HIV, but it is the people who are."
35,12,It doesn't matter if a person's problem with the ACA is'short term'. It's really the people and their concerns about health care.
46,12,"The biggest problem that we have with the government isn't the government. The state is the government. The government should be able to protect people from virus transmission through a program to prevent them from having it spread through blood from a mosquito. The first is not a virus that is spread through the blood of a mosquito, but it's a virus that is infecting your throat."
55,12,>I think it's about time you put a stop to it. I think the main issue here is that the government has no interest in preventing transmission of the virus. They seem to want a big deal about the health of their people.
56,12,"The article, on the other hand, is very true, but I think the title is more of a commentary on what has been posted."
62,12,"CANNOTANSWER: ""Hey, I think that's a joke. I thought that's a joke. He said ""Hey, I thought that's a joke"". I was thinking that the whole thing was a bad idea and that they're just using the wrong word to explain it. The point of a mask is to prevent people from entering the country, presumably to promote public health. It's about why people don't want to give them something to talk about."
65,12,'This is a ridiculous joke.
66,12,The whole ACA veto is a huge mistake.
72,12,">This is an issue not in itself, but in fact that the government is actually attempting to stop the spread of the virus."
78,12,It's an awesome idea for the public health field. It's just a joke.
88,12,The guy who said he doesn't need a mask would be the only one to have that.
90,12,I don't believe the ACA really is the way it is. You can't help people who have a virus in their hand.
93,12,"In other words, the president wants to get rid of the ACA. So he's a dictator."
12,7,So you're saying the president is using the mask to stop the spread of a virus.
12,9,">Hey, I think that's a joke. I thought that's a joke. I was thinking that the whole thing was a bad idea and that they're just using the wrong word to explain it."
13,12,This is what happened to the president of the CIA and the CIA. The government wants to get rid of the ACA.
16,12,"I think if a person wants to work in public, they should have a mask, it's okay and if they are in a public office, it's okay to work there. A person who isn't in public can not have a mask."
17,12,"I have always thought the hat and the hat were the best way to stop the virus, but no one seems to see it as something that I can do and I don't want to be the only one who fucks up about it."
22,12,"Then, when you take a picture of someone wearing a mask, you can say something like, ""But...the whole ACA thing is absurd. I'm not sure why you're asking this. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks."
27,12,"CANNOTANSWER (r-cdc): ""People wearing a mask to prevent the spread of HIV. It's only a problem if they can't get away with it."" You don't know what to do. The answer is in the 'If you can't help me, I'm going to come home to say goodbye to my wife'' (I don't want to ask 'Why don't you try to change my mind'), and the answer is that you're going to be asked if you can change my mind'"
35,12,"You are being a liar, sarcastic."
46,12,The president is a tyrant. It's an interesting point to make:
55,12,"In my opinion, the government has nothing to do with the health of its people, they are supposed to be taking the issue seriously and taking measures to fight the spread of the disease."
56,12,You want to know a bit more about the ACA?
62,12,"You should know what the ""wiping a mask"" means."
65,12,"It's not just the CDC. They are trying to change the ACA, but the CDC is also trying to change their stance on AIDS."
66,12,"The ACA does not affect people with any kind of mental health issues. It reeks of ""troll"" behavior, which is really offensive."
72,12,'Move the hat in a way that makes it look as if the person was wearing a mask.'
78,12,No. It's not a prank.
88,12,The joke wasn't funny.
90,12,"he needs to talk to an attorney in California, and his attorney will explain to you why the federal government is doing it, and how he is doing it, to the people who actually wanted to protect themselves. the movie is about a child whose father was a doctor. there is no way this should ever be a misunderstanding or argument."
93,12,"They didn't say this was a tidbit, they said that you can go through a depressed period and/or crisis due to the healthcare crisis and lack of a doctor, and are not going to survive long enough to make a big change. They said that a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
12,7,">Hey, I think that's a joke. I thought that's a joke. I thought that's a joke. I thought that's a joke. I thought that's a joke. I thought that's a joke."
12,9,">Hey, I think that's a joke. I thought that's a joke. I was thinking that the whole thing was a bad idea and that they're just using the wrong word to explain it. This is what happened to the president of the CIA and the CIA. The government wants to get rid of the ACA."
13,12,I'm an American who has not read any of this.
16,12,"If you want to go after your health profession, then you should look into this."
17,12,"I read it yesterday. This guy was playing with his face. I could be wrong, I just could not figure out how to respond to it."
22,12,ACA is the worst thing I can think of.
27,12,A bit of a snide comment that I thought was in the context of the conversation is absurd.
35,12,The ACA doesn't exist in Australia. It doesn't exist in Canada.

You need to make a joke about that one."""
78,12,A mask is a joke. I don't like the way it's told. The funny part of it is that a politician who doesn't like the idea of wearing a mask is a guy who likes to get away with all the ridiculous ideas he's trying to get out of the Obama administration. I think he might not be the right person for this.
88,12,"I've always wondered if it is a joke that people can make fun of, but don't realize there's a lot of info in this post that makes it sound like the CDC is claiming the vaccine is the best way to prevent a virus."

65,12,It's a huge shame the CDC doesn't want to admit that someone is having a hard time with sex. It's about the stigma attached to it and it's a serious issue that isn't even just about his health.

It's about the stigma attached to it and it's a serious issue that isn't even just about his health.

46,12,That's all. The CDC's attitude is that they can't protect the public from the spread of the virus. The problem is the people aren't getting vaccinated. The problem is that the government doesn't think wearing a mask is the right thing.
55,12,"I think we should stop trying to stop the AIDS epidemic. In my mind, it's all about preventing it. It's a big problem because it is a big deal and it's about the health of people who have it. But if this is the case, there is no right to prevent it."

78,12,The ACA is just a joke. This isn't something you can get away with. It's a joke.

I can't tell why people keep asking him if he does, but if he's 'obsessed' with the disease, he's probably doing it for the betterment of his wife, not for his health. Those are all serious, but I'm not sure what the underlying reason for wearing a mask is."
56,12,It's a prank. It's a prank.
62,12,I don't think anyone has ever said it was an effort to educate someone on a topic that was not a joke.

72,12,the guy who said it was a prank?
78,12,...and now that I think about it the only thing that really matters is if the ACA doesn't address the problem of AIDS. The ACA is the joke because it addresses the problem of the AIDS.

90,12,"I don't know what the sarcastic term is, but I've read this one. You could say anything and everything about it."

12,7,The Obama administration isn't a pawn but one of the biggest forces that has ever gotten them to implement legislation.

22,12,Isn't it possible that people who are cvacs with HIV may not be able to be vaccinated if they don't get vaccinated? There's a CDC/CDC/Pathagram of people who think wearing a mask to stop a virus is a bad idea - eg. people with HIV who aren't even vaccinated to get infecting people. I can't see why people who aren't vaccinate themselves are not even vaccinated.
27,12,People who can't wear a mask don't need to wear a mask. CDC and CDC are not independent organizations. The CDC and CDC are not independent entities. The CDC and CDC are not independent entities.
35,12,It's also the premise of the CDC being more and more critical of the CDC than it is of the other administrations.
46,12,"And yet the CDC will continue to ad a lot about the ACA, and all that is going on, is people using the hat to try and be in a prank."
55,12,"In my opinion, I don't think it's a prank."
56,12,"The president should have repealed ACA, but not repealed it. Rather, he should be an idiot."
62,12,">Hey, I thought that's a joke. He said ""Hey, I thought that's a joke"". I was thinking that the whole thing was a joke. He said ""Hey, I thought that's a joke. He said ""Hey, I thought that's a joke"". He said ""Hey, I thought that's a joke."""

72,12,"This is a great movie! I know it's very offensive, but this one is absolutely brilliant. It's a comedy, and I will be doing all of it again."
78,12,"They can't take a joke that is supposed to be a joke that does not address the problem of AIDS, even if it identifies as a prank."
88,12,This is what the CDC is trying to accomplish and it's the CDC that does it.
90,12,He should have seen the book instead of the book.
93,12,"The first part explains the ""why""."
12,7,I'd have to disagree. This is about the CDC trying to do more to stop AIDS than it was to make it worse.
12,9,"This is the one post I'm watching. It's not about the ACA, but it's about Obama pursuing a national AIDS epidemic in a country that has a high rate of AIDS in people of different races and who's own country."
13,12,"I see the point here, but it's a pretty solid book if you are familiar with it, you might be interested in watching the movie."
16,12,"This is a lot of people saying about the ACA. The ACA is a prank, I can see where a lot of people are getting offended by the prank."
17,12,Why don't people stop making fun of the people who are doing it?
22,12,I'd like to take a few shots of a person who is a prankster to make sure no one is on their phone or talking to them on a phone.
27,12,The CDC does not have any control over what they do or how they do it.
35,12,>The CDC has a history of being critical of Americans. They are also trying to get people to take a risk and help prevent diseases from spreading. It is important to protect them from their virus if they do not. They are not government entities. There is not much they can do about it.

55,12,"""I don't think it's a joke. I think it's about time you put a stop to it. I think the main issue here is that the government has no interest in preventing the spread of the virus.

72,12,"It’s an awesome movie, and it doesn’t make sense."
78,12,I'm not talking about the ACA.
88,12,This has nothing to do with the vaccine. The vaccine isn't health issues. It's not health issues. Vaccines are not health issues. They are not health issues. They are not health issues.
90,12,"It's not about a prank. It's about a shady, deranged, and delusional administration."
93,12,The fact that Obama had been the president when he was in office is irrelevant. I think the issue with Obamacare is the government is out. I think the issue is that they are trying to make the healthcare system inefficient.
12,7,The CDC are trying to do things to stop AIDS by sending a message to people who have already been infected with AIDS. It was a very good first step and the first step is for them to stop putting people in infected people who are too infected with the virus.
12,9,"The article says that people who have AIDS are disproportionately likely to get vaccinated, based on the CDC's actions."
13,12,"""This is a fun movie to watch. It's interesting, as it's actually a comedy movie. I have heard a lot of pranks about the CIA and the ACA. The CDC is doing everything for national security. It's not helping with the spread of the AIDS. This is a prank."
16,12,I can't believe the people who haven't had their health checked out despite being in public for weeks.
17,12,I don't know what it is. I don't understand why they are trying to get a vaccine.
22,12,"It's so hard to think of a good point that it is almost impossible for anyone to say that it's a bad idea for you to say the phrase, ""I just don't understand it"". Whether or not this quote is true is entirely up to the person."
27,12,The CDC is trying to pass an ACA without the consent of an Australian doctor.
35,12,I like the title because it gives me an idea of what it means. Especially for someone who is only 15 years old.
46,12,I think it's an interesting thing to do.
55,12,I'm not a doctor. I'm a health care worker.
56,12,I can't even get a bit of what this movie is about.
62,12,"This is the last straw. This isn't about the ACA, it's about the fact that this was a joke."
65,12,"If it's just a joke, it's not a joke, it's not a joke."
66,12,You've done your job.
72,12,OP can't agree with the other comments about AIDS.
78,12,"This sounds like a real deal, because it was written by the guy who wrote the movie ""The Mask Law"""
88,12,"I think you may be confused - this is a big deal in the context of all this, but you want to look up the definition of health issues and what it's referring to."
90,12,I’ve heard that the Obama administration is doing it with a mask.
93,12,The article states that he is against these policies because it makes a problem of the government's policies.
12,7,[The Obama administration is trying to pass an ACA without the consent of an Australian doctor.]
12,9,I think the government is being ineffective and needs to make them stop putting people in that position.

56,12,"Well, the US government has been trying to get a lot of attention in recent years, but what they are trying to do is be a scumbag with the ACA."
62,12,"It's also a joke that someone who is not the president of the US is trying to show that he understands the ACA is not a joke, but it's an instance of the gov't attempting to make someone seem like the person he is talking to."
65,12,"Why don't you just say ""I don't like wearing a mask when I can't get into a job,"" and then get a restraining order when you can't get into a job?"
66,12,"The book, that's an example of the reversal of a veto. The author is pointing out that the ACA is part of a larger conspiracy to be a troll."

22,12,"If you don't wear a mask, don't. Just leave it."
27,12,"So, you have seen one commenter prank a bit about AIDS and a few of the jokes are pretty funny. I'd like to know if this is one of them. I think this could be just as unhelpful as that one. I wish we could stop this and stop promoting the idea of preventing AIDS."
35,12,"I'm a physician who apologises and says something like this but explains that it's not the biggest health issue that the CDC has a problem with, and is not a bad idea. It is a joke to go about it without understanding what it's referring to. I think a lot of people don't understand it, even in a context like that."
46,12,>I know I'm being a bit cynical. It's because I don't understand what the purpose of the movie is.
55,12,Why is there a joke about wearing a mask at concerts or while on the road?
56,12,This is just a prank about the ACA.
62,12,The ACA isn't a joke. It's a joke about the ACA. It's a joke about the ACA's purpose.
65,12,"The president does not own the health insurance company or the government. The administration does not own any of the health insurance companies or the government. It was just a joke, it was just a joke. I think they are trying to stop the spread of AIDS, but they can't do it."
66,12,This isn't a prank. It's a satire of the book. This is a veto of a veto of an anti-vaccine law.

78,12,"Yes, this isn't a joke, but it's a real joke."
88,12,"I don't think it's funny to be a CDC member. If it was a joke that the CDC doesn't have a policy about making people wear masks, it wouldn't be a joke. They do have a policy to force them to wear masks, but I doubt that's their goal."

22,12,It seems like the CDC is in fact trying to be racist by making a joke to stop the spread of the virus.
27,12,"If you're really concerned about HIV, this is a prank involving someone in a mask that has been putting on the public eye. Getting a new doctor doesn't just stop HIV. They want people to stop vaccinating their shit and stop being part of the medical field."
35,12,"If you look at the ACA, it sounds like they're trying to fix it. Regardless of what the ACA does, it is the most recent one. The first one is called ""the CDC Act."" They want to change the entire ACA, and then some. Now they're going to have to change something. This would not be the kind of joke it would be like if they put a restraining order on a man who wasn't vaccinated."
46,12,I know the doctor's job was to protect patients and that's why we have a vaccine. It is not a prank.
55,12,AIDS isn't really a national problem. It's the disease of the government and not the people in general. People that think that they have to be in a position to fight for them are being trolls.

90,12,"""I don't know what the sarcasm term is, but I don't know why anyone says the movie isn't a good prank. The whole thing seems to be blaming 'police' and people having no interest in what that means."","
93,12,No it’s not. It’s about the whole health care system.
12,7,I didn't read the article because I didn't know what it was about.
12,9,"I have some ideas on the topic of health care, but you don't have the same idea here. I believe the idea of a private clinic doing a national AIDS outbreak is to prevent people from getting vaccinated, but not the entire national health system."
13,12,I have seen many people with this joke.
16,12,"A lot of things about the ACA get upvoted by people who don't agree with it, but don't necessarily agree with the ACA, because it's a joke."
17,12,"Yes, the ACA is the best way to prevent HIV/AIDS. I can't remember the date in which you're actually asking about it, but it's the one that was made in the movie, which is really just a prank. I'm not saying that it's a joke, but if you think there is something wrong with the ACA, what is the matter?"
22,12,"I don't think people can afford to wear masks. I would wear a mask to get vaccinated, but no, you're going to need a mask, but you will need a mask. The CDC will rig your system by destroying it. The ACA isn't on the market. It's a joke, and it's a joke."
27,12,I just want to say that the CDC has a big red flag that they're trying to pass an ACA without consent.
35,12,It's not a joke. CDC doesn't have the resources to take action. They are the one that's preventing it.
46,12,We need to talk to a federal employee. Let them go through their contracts and show them how important it is to keep a full blown vaccinated person safe. We don't need that much.
55,12,Those sexist jokes are just stupid :)
56,12,"The president was talking about the ACA. The ACA was a prank that the other person was trying to use to make a joke, and it was a prank on him to use it to get a lot of attention. That's one of the things that's so important to the American public that people are always surprised and genuinely interested in it. Until a CDC member in the white house decided to put some nonsense in the hat, the government would be very likely to see it as a joke."
62,12,"Yes, the ACA is a joke. The ACA protects people from HIV/AIDS and prevents a number of serious illness in the US. It's the first example of the ""myth"" a health care professional is asking for: This isn't about the ACA. Vaccinations are not a joke."
65,12,"A lot of the jokes in this thread were about the ACA and what the government is trying to do to help the public health. The ACA is a joke to some people, but to others it is a joke to others and a joke to others."
66,12,"So it's all good now and I hope that the book gets reviewed. I'm not sure if the cd works, but I still think it's kinda a troll and I think it's a good book."
72,12,"I thought it was a good joke. I could see the other comments saying that it was too sarcastic. So it isn't really a good idea, and I would find it funny to do so, but I wouldn't want to make any other comments or comments about it."
78,12,"If I was in a medical profession with a mask, I would be going crazy and calling it a prank."
88,12,Because it is a joke.
90,12,I don't understand how you could possibly think that the ACA isn't a good example of what a good example of what a good example of the ACA is?
93,12,What is it about the Obamacare repeal that is making it so much more complicated than the ACA.
12,7,A good example of the health care system is the movie about the ACA.
12,9,"The CDC has no duty to prevent AIDS. If someone is sick or sick, they need a vaccinated person. If you are sick and have not been vaccinated, the government needs to protect the people. Not just that people are sick, but that everyone will want to be safe. Vaccination is a very real thing, he is actually trying to fix it."
13,12,"i don't know if you know what the ACA is or not, but the scma i was using was a joke. what you're referring to is what is essentially a scma and the hat is a joke."
16,12,I have to say that I think this was the best way to do this. This was not a joke and I don't think the CDC should care. There are good examples that could help with this.
17,12,"I'm not even going to comment about how the ACA is a crime, it's a joke."
22,12,There's a link that says the person who is saying this is the one who is being misleading about this
27,12,I think that the main reason that it's a joke is because it's a joke is because they don't want to get away with it.
35,12,CDC is trying to get the CDC to take action on the ACA in other ways. It's going to make you feel better that you're not actually the one in charge of the ACA.
46,12,">I'm in a position to help the CDC, and a bunch of other people here are getting in to help me. I am not even sure I'm an expert in AIDS, but I know what I'm doing. It's pretty clearly a prank, based on a book."
55,12,The President isn't the President. He's the President's clone. The White House is one of the largest organizations in the country.
56,12,The article is misleading and misleading.
62,12,"> (https://www.naa.gov/statutes/Vacks-Action-By-Vermont-Health-Chic-Res.aspx)], ""I've tried to explain what I can do without a mask (what I can do without a mask)"
65,12,The joke is that he has a doctor and a doctor's assistant. It's not a joke to the school. But a joke to his adolescent son. It's a joke to him.
66,12,"CANNOTANSWER is the guy who wrote the book. He's got a book called ""Chilli's List."" I just wanted to make sure.'', ""But the fact that he is wearing a mask is a huge red flag for me."

78,12,Vaccines are not a joke. The joke is to help prevent AIDS.
88,12,i don't see why it is a joke
90,12,"""We can't do that."""
93,12,"It was written by an American, not a Chinese. The article has been a little sarcastic, but it still has the troll tags."
12,7,I'd say the whole point of the article is that he's being clingy. He is being censored by the media and is a prank.
12,9,"""... And he said he wanted the kids to take care of themselves and get their children vaccines, but not to keep them at a certain age. The government didn't have a duty to prevent AIDS."""
13,12,Aaaaand there's a reblog for the same subs with the same titles.
16,12,"""The guy who doesn't have a mask in his office doesn't want to be the one exposing them to a virus in a medical setting."""
17,12,I'm a big fan of this movie.
22,12,You don't understand what you're saying. I'm going to guess that the CDC or the CDC is trying to sell a prank to stop the spread of a virus.
27,12,"""If you can't help me, I'm going to come home to say goodbye to my wife""."
35,12,"You can't make a joke. It's a joke. It's not like they're trying to fix it. The ACA is a joke, not a joke."
46,12,AIDS vaccine was a joke.
55,12,The CDC would like to stop getting rid of AIDS and the CDC wants to stop AIDS and make some money by funding people to have sex.
56,12,It is a joke about the ACA that has been repealed by the US government.
62,12,"This is just an attempt to illustrate some of the common misunderstanding. If your friend wants to avoid wearing a mask in public, then there isn't much to consider. If you can't afford a mask in public, then go and wear a mask. I don't know why you haven't asked."
65,12,"Yes, a joke. Not funny."
66,12,"If the veto was on the Republican party's front page in a movie, it would be a complete bullshit story. The ACA had a veto and the ACA isn't even part of his party. It wasn't passed in 2001 in the US."
72,12,"I feel like when I see this movie, I would probably throw it at someone else - if it was me, I would be thinking about this a lot. It's just a little over the top of sarcastic and not particularly helpful."
78,12,"AIDS isn't a serious problem and you're getting the joke, but it's important to remember the fact that a prank is inherently a joke that addresses the problem of AIDS."
88,12,">“The entire premise of this movie is that the CDC is misrepresenting the issue by informing people that the ""idea"" isn't right."
90,12,It's a prank because of the ACA. The ACA and the Obama administration are not just an issue.
93,12,"The Obamacare repeal was written by an American, not a Chinese. The article has been a little sarcastic, but it still has the troll tags. It is a conspiracy theory. The Obamacare repeal is based on the ACA."
12,7,Vaccines are not health issues. They are not health issues. Vaccines are not health issues. Vaccines are not health issues. Vaccines are not health issues.
12,9,/u/tigberbeast is referring to the AIDS epidemic
13,12,"""It's not a joke. It's a joke."
16,12,Are you going to do this /r/drh? Because I'm on vacation.
17,12,I'm really disappointed with this article.
22,12,I think you have made the right choice.
27,12,There are several people in this thread who want to tell this story. I have never seen this.
35,12,"My experience has been that the word 'happened' to the CDC is ""nothing"" for those who are vaccinated. It's a joke for them to try and take action on the issue."
46,12,I think the president is making a joke. He has no point. He is making a joke. There is no point in trying to stop a prank.
55,12,"Vaccination and STIs are different than a lot of other health issues, I find this article fucking hilarious."
56,12,"He can't get a lot of attention from people who do'make fun' of the ACA and say ""yes, they have done their work in helping the AIDS epidemic. ''"
62,12,"The ACA was designed to help the government prevent the spread of the AIDS epidemic. It's [the last time] a joke has ever been thrown around, [and you know what, you didn't even notice, you were being serious. [Destination about the ACA](http://www.naa.gov/statutes/Vacks-Action_By-Vermont-Health-Chic-Res.aspx) [which was reported, but not repealed](http://www.naa.gov/"
65,12,"No, I think this is just a joke, and not a joke. Rather, I think it's a joke because it's a joke to him."
66,12,"The whole ACA veto is a huge mistake. I'm not sure what to do with the ACA because I don't have a job. I'm not sure what the issue is, but the book seems to be good."
72,12,It's a great movie. And I think the point is to make a movie about the AIDS epidemic to sway the public and that's a good joke. The movie is a prank.
78,12,I don't understand how you could have such an opinion.
88,12,"There is a lot of sarcasm in the comments. It's like saying ""I am a little disappointed"" and ""I don't think they want a prank. I'm a little disappointed"" or ""I don't see why they're overreacting"""
90,12,"It has been mentioned a lot in this sub, but I can't tell you for sure whether it was the author, or the entire ACA - he is a sarcastic asshole."
93,12,The Obamacare repeal is based on the ACA and it is the result of the Bush Administration's attempt at a reevaluation of the health care system.
12,7,"The CDC is trying to stop AIDS, and the ACA is a prank. But its point is that AIDS does not constitute health issues unless there are real people in the population."
12,9,"The article says that he wants to keep the kids safe and that he wants to prevent the spread of AIDS. The Obamacare repeal was written by an American, not a Chinese."
13,12,I mean if you're going to say that.. what the fuck is a prank.
16,12,"I would probably call the CDC an asshole, if that would be a good idea."
17,12,"That is an incredible amount of propaganda. It's very strange, and a little like telling a guy you are pregnant that you were pregnant."
22,12,"If it is true, I am not gonna say it."
27,12,I like the joke. I just don't see how it would be a joke in a situation where if you can't tell a prank it is going to be a joke and that's not going to work. I don't think people want to be forced to stop this nonsense.
35,12,"You seem to be assuming that the word ""prank"" means ""defeat to the health care system""? Is this really a joke?"
46,12,What if there are millions of people who have AIDS?
55,12,">The president is not a prankster. The whole premise of the gov't is: If you think it's funny, you should put on a mask. Then when someone says they don't like the president's shit you don't talk about him."
56,12,The video is a little off-putting. I'm interested in the fact that the president is giving the guy a mask. What's the point of the article?
62,12,"CANNOTANSWER: 'I’m afraid there is a problem, not only with the ACA, but also with the lack of a common courtesy. I don’s not saying that he should wear a mask to prevent the spread of a disease, but a really specific one would be the best way to address it."
65,12,"This is a joke! So, you are joking, this is a joke. The CDC is trying to make it a joke."
66,12,""" The veto is a huge mistake."
72,12,"I love the movie, I like it, and I am a good actor. I have an idea for a movie I love, but I don't have the courage to make a movie I love."
78,12,"I don't understand why people are being so enthused about what's going on and how this is going to get worse. Certainly not because it's a joke, but because people are telling jokes. This isn't a joke, it's a joke, it's a joke."
88,12,I read all of this and laughed my ass off a few times because I was so disgusted by the jokes.
90,12,A lot of this thread seems to be about the government and the health care policy that this guy is pushing for.
93,12,CANNOTANSWER: The article states that the President is against these policies because it makes a problem of the government's policies.
12,7,It would seem that people just aren't putting in the effort to stop the spread of AIDS. I wonder if he wants the president to be able to take a joke out of all these jokes.
12,9,"'Almost everyone is saying this and I'm just glad that you're out of there. This is what happened to the president of the CIA and the CIA. The government wants to get rid of the ACA.', ""[This is a prank] about Obama's policies."
13,12,"I like a good movie. The title makes it seem like a joke, and the joke's about the hive mind, and not the hat."
16,12,>The ACA is a joke that doesn't exist and isn't about pranks.
17,12,Vaccination is not a crime. It is a crime. It is a crime. It is a crime. A law.

27,12,I'm also a vet and I have no idea what a prank is. It sounds like this is a prank.
35,12,'The ACA doesn't exist in Australia. It doesn't even exist in Canada.'
46,12,The movie is based on a book. It's also based on the president's job.
55,12,>I'm very sorry he is a douchebag
56,12,CANNOTANSWER:
62,12,It's an anti-vaccination measure. It is only a joke about the ACA.
65,12,This is about a big deal.
66,12,"""Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."""
72,12,It's called a 'prank' in the United States.
78,12,"In Australia, a federal employee wears a mask to stop the spread of AIDS."
88,12,It's a prank. The joke is a joke.
90,12,"I think the title is a good one, if it hasn't been updated."
93,12,This is a very interesting and important topic. You should really get an educated guess into this. The entire article seems to be about a president that is trying to use his own agenda to protect his own country.
12,7,"That is not the same thing as a joke. The issue isn't just the health of those who have already been vaccinated, but the amount of people who have had their vaccines - whether they have been treated by the government, on the ground - with the ACA. They have been doing their best to get it out. Then the ACA goes into effect - the people who got AIDS are the ones who should be vaccinated."
12,9,"Vaccination is not a crime, it's a crime. It is a crime. It is a crime."
13,12,"It's kind of an unimportant part of the apologies in the article, but I feel like the whole point was to make sure that it was clearly not a joke."

27,12,I feel like this is going to go way beyond that. You can't expect someone to think twice about this and say you are a joke. People think this is a joke and will probably say it again.
35,12,I grew up in New York City and the people who wrote that ACA are all sarcastics. I don't understand what they mean - it's a joke. I do understand that the ACA is the largest prank on the planet and I don't see how that's a joke.
