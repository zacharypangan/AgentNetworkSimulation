86,76,see this is how crazy trump s made the united states of america if you want order in america president donald j trump must take off his mask and turn himself in oh and every day he doesn t people will die starting tonight i m a man of my word covid
97,76,i love coaching however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops
76,16,i do not think it matters if he's not wearing a mask. i just think its a sign he might have a phobia of it
76,39,"What do you mean ""trump must take off his mask and turn himself in oh and every day he doesn't people will die starting tonight """
76,45,"In all seriousness, do you have a job?"
76,58,You don't have to wear a mask for an American.
76,59,It makes more sense to me to wear a mask to see a lot of people walking in a restaraunt.
86,76,"I am surprised that the same thing doesn't happen with Obama, which was announced just as he started walking ten feet through the restaraunt."
97,76,> I love coaching however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops i love coaching
76,16,"I think it's a bit odd that they're calling it the ""must go shaven"" when in reality they're calling it the ""must go shaven"" as in he's walking to see the people in a restaraunt."
76,39,"I'm surprised that the same thing doesn't happen with Obama, which was announced just as he started walking ten feet through a restaraunt."
76,45,Do you have a job? You don't have to wear a mask for an American.
76,58,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
76,59,"I like to play football, but it is more difficult to wear a mask when you're in a restaraunt - and it's also difficult for someone to wear a mask that's uncomfortable - than it is to wear a mask when you're walking a restaraunt."
86,76,"So Donald J. Trump is not a good politician, he is just a man of your word, I don't have a problem with it."
97,76,"I will not coach. It's not that I'm comfortable with wearing a mask, but that it can cause serious injury."
76,16,"I'm not surprised at all that Trump, and especially the media, seem to disagree. That said, there are a lot of other reasons that it's not an actual thing. It's not really a matter of why he's shaven, and I think it's not at all the fact that it's more likely a sign that Trump has a phobia of it."

76,45,I was in the same boat as you but a friend of mine had a mask on for his team.
76,58,"As someone who was born in the United States and worked at a psych ward as a coach, I'd say that's not so bad."
76,59,"I hate to tell you, but I think in the end, he is a man of his word."
86,76,"You know, putting on a mask doesn't prevent people from being violent. It's an anti-viral way to protect yourself."
97,76,"The article says you must not wear a mask because it is considered a part of the US's security system. But you do have to be extremely careful with helmets, and it is one of the most dangerous things you can be wearing while playing football in college. The helmet is supposed to keep your teammates from being hurt. It's not supposed to prevent any injuries in college, it's supposed to prevent them from getting hurt."
76,16,">Donald J. Trump is not a good politician, he is just a man of his word."
76,39,I am a football coach. I was born in the US and was part of a military force and i hate it when my coaches are shaved. My head never moves and my head does not move much.
76,45,So you are wearing a mask to stop the spread of a virus?
76,58,"if you're a fan of a certain fucking virus, why should you wear a mask as well?"
76,59,[[Blog title](http://www.reddit.com/r/r/u/relationships/r/r/r/Rambos/relationships/relationships/)
86,76,Putting on a mask is a medical condition. It will not prevent any health problems. You cannot have a disease. You are not allowed to have a virus.
97,76,"No, this is not the President's idea of safety. This is the person who says that ""we are going to have a great career if we do not wear helmets and masks at our colleges,"" which would be a way for the president to take a better look at all of his policies."
76,16,"Trump does not want you to wear a mask. He wants you to keep you safe, not the rest of you. This is the presidents idea of safety, and he has not done that."
76,39,... I'm gonna ask if you're allowed to wear a mask in your profession. I am a physician and I have a history of putting on a mask to prevent some serious disease that is more dangerous than any other masks I have ever worn. I just want to have a look.
76,45,"I shave my head, and that's very uncomfortable, but not very safe. Putting on a mask is the only thing that makes it comfortable. I don't wear a mask as a coach, but I'm not worried about it."
76,58,"As a member of the military, I have not seen anyone wearing a mask."
76,59,"Having a phobia of it is not a bad thing. You need to have a proper face, not an insecure face."
86,76,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
97,76,"I don't really know what to say in a comment if the whole thing is racist, but I still prefer the president to be more a dick."
76,16,"Leaving a helmet on when I'm playing? What kind of job do you have? And what is a job that's about to have an office? I don't have a job so I don't get to have to work with a person in a suit. I don't see the problem with a job that is a job that requires a manager, a manager or an administrator. This is a position that I find to be hard to justify to any candidate who says it's okay to use a mask on while playing a game. Its"

76,45,Putting on a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
76,58,What about getting your head shaved so you can look more healthy with your facial hair?
76,59,"I think the president has a problem with that. If he actually is a President, why does he want to be a president? I'm sure he has a good idea for the future."
86,76,>I see a lot of people here saying it's not worth putting on a mask. It's about time you put a stop to it.
97,76,The op's statement was a reference to the president's attitude about the situation in general. This article was taken from a really well researched book (which was written by a top USN journalist).
76,16,You are not talking about the president. You are talking about the president being a man of his word.
76,39,"I don't think you're wrong. It's not racist to want a coach to shave or not be allowed to put on a mask when they play football. The president's attitude isn't that bad. But that's a different kind of racism than I think. I think the way this guy is acting is kind of off the wall, and I think he's a stupid bitch."
76,45,"Is it really that big of a deal. He can't even stand the idea of having your head shaved? Doesn't he have a job where he has to wear a mask. That being said, he must be a great ally of the country. It's not that hard to find jobs without a mask. :)"
76,58,"I don't even know why you can't wear a mask when you're playing? I know a guy who goes out of his way to tell you the truth, so maybe thats why he's just not going to make the right decision."
76,59,"The whole ""The President, who believes we are the best we can be when we don't wear a mask is infuriating and isn't willing to take that ""sensational "" to be offensive"" kind of thing is ridiculous."
86,76,"[the US has some nice, old policies and a great deal of good news. I don't think you're a troll. You said it in a thread about a guy who slammed his post into his head?"
97,76,"It's been a very long time since a sports team was played on the NFL since the '80s. We're in our 40s and the football team is a lot safer without a mask. I mean, that means that you can wear a mask to get all the shots."
76,16,I've got a phobia of football and I'm not saying that I have to shave my head because I've not been able to. Putting on a mask is a really nice way to prevent a phobia. Definitely not as a very useful item.
76,39,">I am a physician and I have a history of putting on a mask to prevent some serious disease that is more dangerous than any other masks I have ever worn. I just want to have a look. I shave my head, and that's very uncomfortable, but not very safe. Putting on a mask is the only thing that makes it comfortable. I don't wear a mask as a coach, but I'm not worried about it. As a member of the military, I have not seen anyone wearing a mask."
76,45,Is it possible the president is not a racist or racist racist? Probably not.
76,58,This is a completely different type of shit. It's a bunch of people trying to change their attitudes based on the 'Op's statement' and using a shit article to justify it.
76,59,The joke is actually about how bad a man's reaction is to a guy who has a history of putting on a mask. It's not just the president. The president hasn't said anything to stop it.
86,76,"I think you should stop being a troll, you are a troll."
97,76,">The article is titled ""The President of the United States of America"""
76,16,>I see a lot of people here saying it's not worth putting on a mask. It's about time you put a stop to it.
76,39,"Its a troll, not a troll."
76,45,he's saying he's a bit of a fucking asshole

76,59,"I don't think putting on a mask is a good idea unless you are in a situation that you can't tolerate, and I know a lot of people who do. But I do think that putting on a mask is one of the dumbest things a man's ever done."
86,76,This is exactly what happened to my son.
97,76,"This article is a petty thing, a petty one. A lot of people don't understand why the President is wearing a mask. A lot of people don't understand the value of the presidency."
76,16,"I don't understand the term ""seen on the wall"" in this context. I see your statement, but I don't think this makes it right."
76,39,"I think this makes me look stupid. I don't think there's any rational discussion about the masks, just that it's part of the military's policy to not wear them at all. I don't see why it's wrong to want a coach to shave his head. I don't think it's racist to want a coach to put on a mask at a game that isn't a game, and if someone isn't wearing a mask, then it's a big deal. But what about the lack of "
76,45,The only person in the United States who has actually shaved their head is a neocon. That's something to keep in mind.
76,58,I'm a physician and I have a history of putting on a mask to prevent some serious disease that is more dangerous than any other masks I have ever worn.
76,59,He is using the article a bit too much - and the other commenters don't understand. The fact that he is using the article is ridiculous.
86,76,"I'm a huge fan of the Obama Administration, but I don't think you're a troll. It sounds like a bunch of idiots who are the victim of the Obama slam."
97,76,">The article is titled ""The President of the United States of America"""
76,16,"The whole ""The President of the United States of America"" thing is kind of ridiculous. It's the same shit as wearing a mask for all the other guys on the board."
76,39,I'm a big fan of the Obama Administration.
76,45,"I am not sure if you're a racist or not, but I know that there are several things that are wrong with the Obama administration, including the fact that it's really not an issue. The point here is that it's a really unpopular opinion and it's a bit unpopular."
76,58,"I’m a doctor. I put on a mask and my husband went to a game and he said I was uncomfortable with it. I ended up with a black face and I’m afraid it was a problem for my husband. My wife went to college and I’d wear a mask and I’d have no fear of it. I even shaved my head when I was playing. He was in the middle of a game and he was not able to feel his face and look at me like he was a fucking problem with me,"
76,59,He could be a troll and even a rambo who shaves his head and is a racist troll.
86,76,"If you can't figure out the proper word, you're a troll."
97,76,> I hate the idea of Trump being told to put off the mask.
76,16,"I'm not sure if you're a racist, but you are a troll. You have no idea who I am. You're not a racist."
76,39,"My mom is a doctor, she's not that good with hockey, and her husband is a doctor. When he is wearing a mask, she doesn't shave. She was not able to see him barefoot when the game was over. The mask didn't help her."
76,45,"He doesn't have to wear a mask. He can't wear one because he hasn't gotten the time to properly fit it. But that's the sort of thing that would scream ""I don't want a face shaved!"" If he wanted to get shaved and don't like the idea of shaves at the game, it's a bad idea."
76,58,So this article makes you look stupid.
76,59,"The whole ""the President of the United States of America"" thing is kind of ridiculous. It's the same shit as wearing a mask for all the other guys on the board."
86,76,"You said it in a thread about a guy who slammed his post into his head?, ""You know, putting on a mask doesn't prevent people from being violent. It's an anti-viral way to protect yourself."", ""You know, putting on a mask doesn't prevent people from being violent.

97,76,"As a teacher, I would wear a mask all day. It's very cool to wear. I love it. But I'm a football coach and it's the only thing I can be comfortable with. Whenever I get sick I put on a mask or a t Shirt (i'd be a little bit hurt) and it will hurt me. When I get sick it gets uncomfortable. But I get that in the sense that I don't want to be a football coach if a football team makes me uncomfortable, which is why I'm not going"
76,16,I have no clue how to say that this article makes you look stupid.
76,39,">But what about the lack of : The whole ""the President of the United States of America"" thing is kind of ridiculous."
76,45,"A mask and a mask for your wife are also good alternatives to a mask because they don't mask your face. In most cases, a mask makes the person feel as if they are a superhero or something."
76,58,"""That's a completely different type of shit. It's a bunch of people trying to change their attitudes based on the 'Op's statement' and using a shit article to justify it."", ""I love coaching however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops i do not think it matters if he's not wearing a mask."
76,59,"I love this comment. I think it's so insulting and sad that so many people think it's a great idea to do it, and that it really hurts to have that kind of conversation."
86,76,I'm sorry but I don't understand the context of your post.

76,16,So what about the lack of :
76,39,I think your post was actually intended for a post on this sub.
76,45,"I feel like the ""Obama was not meant to be a jerk."" was a reference to something I know about the administration."
76,58,It sounds like someone who has actually shaved their head and doesn't like wearing a mask doesn't think it's a good idea.
76,59,Is a mask supposed to prevent the spread of a virus?
86,76,I can understand why it's not a joke. If I see people arguing with me about it in an Obama interview and then I have to put on a mask.
97,76,>I don't understand why the president should do this. He's not a leader. It's also a big deal that the players in the NFL are the only ones that are at fault for the AIDS problem.
76,16,I think it's a lot of BS that someone who is in a minority is slammed on a helmet because it isn't as comfortable as a face mask.
76,39,I don't think this comment is intended for a post on this sub.
76,45,There is something I don't understand about the President's position and I'm not sure I understand what it's meant to be but I do know the reason behind it and I understand why.
76,58,The Obama presidency was pretty much a statement about preventing the spread of a deadly disease in the world.
76,59,There's a reason we have a LOT of shit here. You guys got to see them all at the same time.
86,76,">The problem with a mask is the people wearing it don't actually know how to walk because they think it's bad. The issue is not a joke, the issue is an anti-viral way to protect yourself."
97,76,"The president has to stand up to his accusers and tell them that the player isn't at fault. There are ways to prevent a virus, especially if it's just a cough and it's a painful thing to cough. This is a common occurrence in football."
76,16,">He's a lot of people here saying it's not worth putting on a mask. He wants you to keep you safe, not the rest of you. This is the president's idea of safety, and he has not done that."
76,39,"The remark I made in the title of my last post said that the president didn't have to take off his mask when he started shaved. The comments I made about this make it seem like he's trying to put on a mask as a sign that he may have a phobia of it and that I don't feel comfortable enough to get in touch with him. This could have been just as racist as the president saying that the players are not in the same boat as the players, and that I have no problem with the coaches."
76,45,There are so many things people don't understand.
76,58,"I think what you have just said is totally incorrect. I mean it's just a generalized stereotype, but it's just a general idea of how someone is going to feel and feel. The only way it'll make you feel is if they're uncomfortable with it and it doesn't work in that way."
76,59,"I don't know if this has a specific meaning in the context of the post, but the general consensus is that it is a big deal and a bad thing."
86,76,Is your question based on the information you have given me?
97,76,CANNOTANSWER:
76,16,"You're talking about the people who're not allowed to put on a mask. The question is, are you a racist?"
76,39,CANNOTANSWER:
76,45,"OP, you are correct."
76,58,"i think it's kind of a bad idea if he's trying to be a good president, if he's a dick who doesn't want the president to take a helmet off while he's on the field"
76,59,"That's the same idea that the ""Obama was not meant to be a jerk"" is a reference to, you know."
86,76,"You have a really good question about the government. The ad doesn't address the entire issue of government policy. And it does NOT address the idea of preventing the spread of disease. It's like saying if the administration wants to change the healthcare system, they need to change how they treat people."
97,76,A little shady hating. Why does it bother you that so many of us do these things?
76,16,">The whole ""The President of the United States of America"" thing is kind of ridiculous. It's the same shit as a joke, the issue is an anti-viral way to protect yourself."
76,39,"It's a big deal. If your mask didn't protect your face from infection, it'd be illegal."
76,45,'The president doesn't have to wear a mask. He can't wear one because he hasn't gotten the time to properly fit it.'
76,58,It's a joke about how the president is a dick.
76,59,"CANNOTANSWER: ""We don't wear a mask because we're afraid of it,"" and when we're actually doing this we're talking about the people who wear masks that are supposed to prevent the spread of the disease."
86,76,"As a former NFL player, I agree with you and don't see why this sub is so important to me."
97,76,I don't think it bothers me.
76,16,if you've got a phobia of football then you're a racist. i don't get it.
76,39,It's also a joke about how the president doesn't have to wear a mask.
76,45,What a jerk!
76,58,'President of the United States of America' is a generalization that has been used in the past by the media. It's a generalization that the President of the United States of America is a racist.
76,59,"'I don't think putting on a mask is a good idea unless you are in a situation that you can't tolerate, and I know a lot of people who do'"
86,76,The ACA was a joke.
97,76,Because the only way the president can change the climate in the country is by being the one that creates the environment to support the players in the world. The team would need to learn about the world's climate to avoid a violent violent reaction that would destroy the country and kill its citizens.
76,16,There's a guy that I've shaved my head before and was still a little scared about. That's a very common misconception among the players.
76,39,You're just saying: 'President of the United States of America' is just a joke.
76,45,It's also the only person in the US who has actually shaved their head and a friend of mine had a mask on for his team.
76,58,>I love coaching however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops i do not think it matters if he's not wearing a mask.
76,59,As a former NFL player I'm not sure what I think is a good idea. I don't want to make a point to anyone.
86,76,"As a Canadian, I can relate to that in a different way."
97,76,I'm really sorry for that. I've been writing for years now.
76,16,"The president does not wear a mask because it's not a good idea to protect you, nor does it protect your health and the environment he is in. Is it not appropriate to wear a mask in the workplace if you are in the workforce?"
76,39,"My grandfather wore a mask to prevent the spread of the AIDS virus, and that made him look as if he was in the same boat as my grandmother. I hated wearing a mask in a military setting, and it was kind of embarrassing."
76,45,>He doesn't have to wear a mask. He can't wear one because he hasn't gotten the time to properly fit it.''
76,58,"[Hey, I have to get on the ball with my face off. I'm a dick. I've got a problem with my face. Trying to get the body into a state of limber with a mask I'm wearing doesn't make a lot of sense. I can't stand it. I can't even stand my head on. I can't stand it."
76,59,"Aside from the actual question, I have not read the rest of the post."
86,76,>What a mess. This is quite interesting and very pertinent. I'm very interested in the story. I see a lot of people here saying it's not worth putting on a mask. It's about time you put a stop to it.
97,76,It is not racist and I want to put on my mask and stop talking to the people. Is there some way to stop that? Is there any way to stop this nonsense? Is there any way to change that? Does there any way to change that?
76,16,>I see a lot of people here saying it's not worth putting on a mask. It's about time you put a stop to it. It is not racist and I want to put on my mask and stop talking to the people. Is there any way to change that?
76,39,"I don't even know why people don't understand it: a guy doesn't have to wear a mask, just doesn't have a proper head covering. If he's in his 20s with his head covering him, I guess he'll probably resign soon."
76,45,"The point was not to be offensive, but to imply that it was offensive to an American - that a mask doesn't give the person a choice about what they do for work."
76,58,"If you want to work at a hockey game in the US, I recommend going into a gym and taking a shave, then wear a mask. It's a nice thing. A guy has to stand up for himself."
76,59,"Are you ok with me saying that putting on a mask is a good idea, is it a bad idea or just doesn't seem appropriate?"
86,76,"""There is a large amount of BS going on between the president and the NFL, which is really a bit of a joke."
97,76,"OP, you mean? You can still be uncomfortable with it, but you have to put on a mask when you get sick. I don't see it as a joke, just a joke. I think the issue is that a mask isn't a joke, it's a joke and the idea of it isn't a joke."
76,16,The mask doesn't give you a choice about what you do for work.
76,39,">'Putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i've ever done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things', 'What do you mean ""President of the United States of America' is just a joke."
76,45,Why did he want to wear a mask?
76,58,I’ve never heard that a mask is just a mask.
76,59,[Kobe Bryant: I wear a mask as a form of protective clothing and as a way of letting my body know what it looks like.](https://www.mlb.org//samples/cs.shtml) he also wore a mask to protect himself in an emergency and is also putting on a mask because it made him feel worse after putting on a mask.
86,76,"You can't stop the evilness of the ACA. It's part of government policy. And it's a joke that the ACA is about to be passed. I think it's an awesome idea, but what isn't the joke based on what the article says?"
97,76,"Is it a joke? I mean, I'd rather the President be a dick then a president."
76,16,I don't even see that as the answer.
76,39,It is also a joke about how the president doesn't have to wear a mask. It's part of government policy. And it's part of a joke that the ACA is about to be passed.
76,45,>I don't know why people don't understand it:
76,58,"Having a proper mask is not a joke, it's a joke that is just a joke."
76,59,Is this just a joke?
86,76,What a prank!
97,76,"I think it's pretty ridiculous that the article is a joke because it's so much more interesting than just a joke. Basically it's saying ""The President is going to have a great career if we do not wear a mask,"" which is probably the least racist thing we've heard about this situation."
76,16,"If you've got a phobia of football, you shouldn't be wearing a mask. I shave my head at least once a day, even on days I haven't slept. It's a very uncomfortable experience, and it's like having to stand in line with someone in a chair. You can't even stand outside."
76,39,This article has nothing to do with it.
76,45,Putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when I get to my table is one of the dumbest things things I've ever done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things.

76,16,It's an article about a joke based on what you've just described.
76,39,"I just want to have a look. I shave my head, and that's very uncomfortable, but not very safe."
76,45,"I didn't like this, but I really think it was a great article."
76,58,"In addition to what I wrote, this article was called the ""Peter Parker - putting on a mask to protect a body from virus infection"" and is also a joke."
76,59,I think a joke like that is just a joke about being a fucking president.
86,76,I'm curious why Trump is such a troll? Why can't he just do a little to stop the ACA from being passed? Why can't he just go on a date with the president and not go to a party fundraiser?

76,39,"What about the 'The President doesn't have to wear a mask' joke? It's not racist because the president is putting on a mask, but because a person doesn't care about the rules of the government and doesn't want to change the rules. What it isn't racist is that he is not going to change it, he will not change it, which is not what the article says."

86,76,"The problem with the ACA is that it does not prevent any disease. And it does not stop the spread of a virus. The EPA and the NFL should stop wearing it. That's exactly what I'm looking for.

76,16,I’m just going to give a big nod to the rest of the comments that you guys did and made a joke about the president. The whole reason he did the things you’ve described is because he feels uncomfortable and wants the rest of the team to wear them in his workplace and is doing the same to everyone else.

76,45,It's not even a joke. It's a joke.
76,58,"There's a reason the CIA and the NSA aren't implementing the EPA / NFL laws on shaved coaches.
