38,20,"I feel like we should ask the health department for clarification on what is being done, then get to the root cause and ask for clarification on this issue."
38,24,It is not that dumb. I love playing at the game and the coach said he can hardly keep up with a little bit of the play
38,35,This was a very interesting comment and a great read. I wish we could put this in more articles if we could.
40,38,We should have a helmet that has a tipped whistle on it for the head.
52,38,"In my state, they have it on the helmet. If they don't, they may not have it, which in turns might be a valid excuse"

79,38,This is very disturbing. It is not a crime. There is a threat of disease spreading around the world. It is a threat to the environment and to the national health system.

38,16,"I am gonna be the first to admit this is stupid. It's not like they didn't do something that would affect your health, and you are now being infected. That is no good. The fact that you can wear a mask if you can't protect yourself is probably an indicator of a problem with your health. I don't care. It's a horrible, horrible thing to do. Besides, it's not good for your health. It sounds like your doctor is incompetent. This doesn't have a problem unless it was in"
38,19,"People need to stop smoking in order to keep the viruses off the surface of the world, and for the most part they should wear their masks."
38,20,This has to be something that needs to be clarified.
38,24,I think you are right about that. People have had a great time.
38,35,I can't stand using a mask to go through restaraunts.
40,38,"Its a bit overrated, but not unoriginal, to me it's part of the laws deployed by the government to stop the spread of viruses. I think it might be a dummy issue but to a lesser degree we could see why the NSA and the NFL are doing all the work. Were we all on the same page as everyone else? The government has an innate power to do whatever is best for us as a nation."

58,38,I read the article claiming that wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
59,38,It's funny you think a bit too many things are considered nitpicks in that they actually equate putting on a mask to being vaccinated. Is this part of the act of taking care of the problem?
66,38,And you are a politician whose job is to stop a government from spreading the 'villians'.
79,38,How can he be as good as a woman? He has to wear a mask to get rid of it.
89,38,The guy I was talking about had a problem with the mask so when he took off the mask he was fucking the restaraunt.
90,38,"The word is ""sad"", so I'll say what you say."
100,38,"That's not true. You need to wear a mask, but don't forget that this program will be aimed at reducing the risk of a serious infection in the world's poorest population."
38,5,Wearing a mask to fight an illness. Wearing a mask to fight a virus is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
38,10,I have never heard this before. It is a very long and very common misconception that people wearing masks are not just vaccinating themselves.
38,14,It's not really a valid reason to wear a mask to fight an illness.
38,16,"It's not a nitpick that we need to stop smoking, it's just that our government wants to get us a better health, so we can keep that up. Having the flu vaccine, and our government doing all the work, is just as nitpicking as if you have some kind of mental illness."
38,19,"I think this is really funny because there are a lot of things the government wants the US to do. But, the other things they want to do are not going to help the health of America. They just want to try to prevent those things and stop them from spreading them."
38,20,[This has to be something that needs to be clarified.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violent-viruses).
38,24,I don't know the actual dissent but if you are using that phrase for the benefit of other people you are not missing anything.
38,35,There are several reasons why this is stupid. It's one of the most important parts of the U.S. government's strategy to get people to wear a mask to fight an illness. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
40,38,What would be the point of the helmet? It doesn't seem to fit the bill.
52,38,CANNOTANSWER:
58,38,"I'm not a doctor, and I have no interest in doing things. I'd rather have a good time than being an authority than trying to figure it out, as that's where the problems lie."
59,38,I'm going to have to go to the hospital with you to get vaccinated.
66,38,I had to tell the lady that she had her throat sucked from my throat so she was harmed. She said she was too scared to let her nose go and she would have to tell her husband to take off her nose. I was terrified of her face and walked off. I'm not a scientist.
79,38,I'm assuming this quote is related to a specific article that is a bit similar to the one here:
89,38,"It's not a joke, it's a joke. Putting on a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. He was fucking the restaraunt"
90,38,"That was an important point. Why does the government say that, the government is sending a message? It seems like it is trying to stop the spread of HIV. The government says that it's a common health problem, that the government needs to stop, so they have to be responsible for the issue."
100,38,You're being a dick. You aren't right. Having a mask doesn't mean it's actually working. You're wrong.
38,5,They're all idiots. The point of all these is to stop the spread of a virus.
38,10,a lot of things the government wants to do are not going to help the health of America. They just want to try to prevent those things and stop them from spreading them.
38,14,Is this the kind of stuff I would wear on my face?
38,16,">I am gonna be the first to admit this is stupid. It's not like they didn't do something that would affect your health, and you are now being infected. That is no good. The fact that you can wear a mask if you can't protect yourself is probably an indicator of a problem with your health."
38,19,Well you’re not being a dick and I’m not trying to make a joke. I don’t think this is a joke either.
38,20,I see no reason to think wearing a mask to fight an illness will be a good idea. Isn't the virus a common health problem?
38,24,"This is not an issue in the US, this is just a problem here. It's not about preventing the spread of a virus. It's about helping prevent the spread of a virus."
38,35,I think what's interesting is how people are arguing about it in the comments.
40,38,"Why do you think this is relevant? You need to be more witty, but more truthful than this..."
52,38,"""Hey man, this is why we should re-name it's ''The Doctor'' and ''The Doctor''. The Doctor wants the state to be the best state to teach his players and not give him the choice between the sexyness of a mask or a mask worn under a helmet."
58,38,"In my opinion the NSA is absolutely indestructible and I think that's why a bunch of people in Colorado are so afraid that anyone wearing a mask is the only way to do that. You can't do it without a mask, even in some places if you do not want it. But that's not the problem, you're not even the one who has to worry about the threat."
59,38,The first person comments on the video are based on my knowledge of how the government is doing things in our country.
66,38,I am not sure how to respond to this.
79,38,"I'm a student of foreign languages. I learned that when my grandmother first left, I used to be a snob at college a few years ago. I spent years in schools in India, where she did not have a permit. She went to school in an isolated town where she wore a mask all the time. I went to a large university in China and went to school with her mother."
89,38,"In short, putting on a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
90,38,"Is this a thing of the past? It's not an issue, it's a government issue."
100,38,"He said his genitals aren't well. He told his friends he wasn't doing enough, but that his doctors didn't tell him."
38,5,The reason they are all idiots is because they're trying to enslave people to protect themselves.
38,10,It is a common misconception that people who don't wear masks are not just vaccinating themselves.
38,14,"It's not a joke, it's a joke."
38,16,> The first person comments on the video are based on my knowledge of how the government is doing things in our country.
38,19,"In the video, he gets a very high response and says a lot of things about the government, including a ""stop the spread of a virus. """
38,20,"If a patient does not get the virus through their own body - like the doctor, he will not be able to fend off it. He is committing suicide, and he is likely to not live his entire life because of the virus. It is a terrible idea, and his father must be trying to get the virus to stop."
38,24,"Assuming the vaccine doesn't prevent any diseases, they should not be doing anything to stop it. They're just the people using them to prevent it."
38,35,It's very interesting how people are arguing about it. Is this a thing of the past?
40,38,It doesn't seem to fit the bill. Because that's the way it is. You're right to be offended and you're wrong to be angry.
52,38,Is there any govt or scouts in your state that you may be interested in?
58,38,Those two are exactly how you're going to find out the truth.
59,38,The government has done little to help. I'm a very active part of the government.
66,38,"Despite his efforts to obliterate the US government's ""care for everyone"" policies and to be an immuniser for sex, the US government is still a far cry from what we've been talking about in terms of anti-virus. They do have to do something about that."
79,38,"Yes, the mask will be used in the public. But the truth is that it was invented in the 80s."
89,38,It's funny how the person who posted this thought putting on a mask is a fad in an 'advice' movie. The one where it is all about a doctor and it's a joke.
90,38,It's one of the worst things to happen in America.
100,38,The fuck is going on.
38,5,... that's a joke.
38,10,It is actually a common misconception that people who do not wear masks are not just vaccinating themselves.
38,14,"I've been with the government for almost three years now. I screamed at the 'death to an entire government.' but no. It's not the same thing, just a joke."

38,19,"He got his first sex of the year, and now, in his early 20s, he is being obliterated."
38,20,"This is a pity that it's not a joke. I don't think it's too bad. I think the government does have a lot of authority over these issues, and I'm just surprised to see such a high number of things being reported about. I'm surprised a majority of the people who complain about this have been able to make that much of an impact. It's really bad for the people who don't have enough to do anything about it."
38,24,I think it's funny how people comment on it because it's an incredibly ignorant and disconcerting idea.
38,35,YES... it is an old issue and you are not going to make it right.
40,38,I think OP has more information about the role the NSA has played in spreading HIV/AIDS than anyone.
52,38,">The doctor in the national guard vowed to avoid wearing a mask, but I was just laughing because the doctors have been vowed to do the same to their coach who is going to have to deal with some health issues and make their decisions in this regard, and he's not going to listen to them anyway.

89,38,I think the movie is a good one.
90,38,The whole idea of a sexist bill or bill being passed is ridiculous. You're gonna have to watch it again.
100,38,The biggest thing is the stigma - he can't stop wearing it. I would be concerned if he just wore it because he knew he wasn't doing enough to not get the message across.
38,5,I've heard the whole thing for years that it isn't good to wear a mask when you don't have HIV or some form of it.
38,10,"A lot of people are trying to tell their children the facts. And if they don't know this, then they'll think it's a joke."
38,14,I think it's kind of ironic the NSA has been so focused on the ACA.

38,5,I've written about these things before.
38,10,I don't think this is a joke either.
38,14,Putting on a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
38,16,I think the greatest thing to happen in this country is not that a doctor has to tell the guy he is infected with HIV/AIDS to get it. There is a way for this guy to go home and be comfortable.

38,20,RIP Obama and get rid of the president.

40,38,"Considering that the CDC is supposed to get rid of masks in order to keep this going, I doubt it's really the issue at hand, or he's trying to convince them that he doesn't have much information about it."
52,38,"The President can’t blame you for the health problems that are a threat. But his comments recurred. You said it clearly, “It’s not a joke. It is a joke, but it doesn’t matter. It’s not like they are being shady, hypocrites of the presidency. I’m a lawyer. I’m just trying to convey what I heard in the video. The Obama Administration isn’t good at the ACA, so it’s not like they don’t do it in the first place."
58,38,They're a lot more likely to think it was a joke.
59,38,The President is the problem. That's a terrible idea.
66,38,[NAME] : I don't like hating on Trump.
79,38,What the fuck is a sexist joke? Affection can be serious if you believe it.
89,38,"Is there any part of the article that said ""it's funny how the person who posted this thought putting on a mask is a fad in an advice movie.""?"
90,38,"Affirmative action: In a film, the president is unable to effectively address this specific issue, including the ineffective treatment of HIV. It's also difficult to imagine what the issue would be in the real world."
100,38,"He's wearing a mask because he has a hard time breathing. It's uncomfortable. It's insecure, it's not insecure. I'm talking about it being insecurity and that stigma is what's really bothering me. He's trying to convince himself that he is more comfortable wearing a mask than having sex with someone who doesn't like sex, it's because the mask can make him feel insecure."
38,5,I don't see why you would wear a mask with your hands while not having HIV. I think they will get rid of it.
38,10,"""He said his genitals aren't well. He told his doctors he wasn't doing enough, but that his doctors didn't tell him."", ""The fuck is going on."
38,14,The president can't take this as the first thing to fuck off and he can't put on a mask and go home.
38,16,Nope. It doesn't sound like a joke.
38,19,"Considering that the CDC is supposed to get rid of masks in order to keep this going, I doubt it’s really the issue at hand, or he’s trying to convince them that he doesn’t have much information about it."
38,20,It’s about that president who wants to be a doctor for the HIV epidemic and not on a medical plane. He’s trying to get rid of his people and his children.
38,24,"This is all nonsense. If we stop the CDC from going through a lot of hoaxes in the past two years, the joke is gone and we are getting more people to dread the President. So, we should make a 'Dig the President' comment in order to get rid of the president."
38,35,It's a really sad pity that I got caught up in all of this. I wish people would take this as a compliment for the president and I'm sure that would be helpful.

58,38,>I think a lot of the NSA is attempting to influence the policy makers and government to stop a virus.
59,38,I just wanted to say that the article isn't a joke. It is a joke.
66,38,"That's very true. I am not saying I want to be a troll, but I think it's a good way to explain to the audience why he shouldn't wear a mask, because he is a doctor."
79,38,"It is a joke, but it also is a joke. And here are the comments: ""I'm a huge Trump fan. r/relationships. It is a joke, but it also is a joke. You could try to be a hilarity queen in this thread, or even be an actual hilarity queen. That's the way they were intended. It makes no sense. It doesn't make sense."

52,38,"It's a joke. But it's not because of the ACA, it's that the ACA is the best way to protect children and teachers."
58,38,"This is very strange. I'm sure if the US were to adopt this strategy in its entire life it would be with a ban on it, like if we allowed an entire nation to act like that. It would also not be with a ban on it, like if we allowed it to exist in every other nation."

79,38,It's not a joke. Vaccination is not a big deal.
89,38,They're making a joke about a joke.
90,38,A movie about the ACA is a good example of how the Obama Administration has dealt with the health care system. The movies about health care are all very different.
100,38,"Is there anything to this, other than what he's been smurging with the last few months?"
38,5,Vaccination is not a joke.
38,10,"In the US, it's a national security issue, which is a big part of why most vaccines aren't approved, especially at the start of the war. I think the biggest issue with ACA is that the people with the disease will start using it."
38,14,"It was kind of ridiculous. The President screamed ""Well you’re not being a dick and I’m not trying to make a joke."""
38,16,That's all very well explained. I'm just saying that it's a joke....but that you can't wear it because you don't want to have an infection or a problem with your health.
38,19,You have the right to be called a dick.
38,20,"In the article, the phrase ""Making a mask to fight an illness is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violent-viruses). It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
38,24,"CANNOTANSWER was the only one that actually thinks it is ""nothing special"" in the US."
38,35,"I mean, he does a good job of not having a job. If I were him, I'd just say ""It doesn't matter if I get sick with it"" and ""I don't have a job because I want to get to help others."" But he is doing a good job and is not one who doesn't get to do much and that is the way to go."
40,38,"I think you've missed the point of the article. I'd have been looking for the op's perspective and found a guy who doesn't wear a mask. It's kind of odd to think that it's a joke, but it's actually really interesting and interesting to think about."
52,38,"- oh the truth. ""Son, there's nothing we can do to make the ACA work. The problem isn't the ACA. The problem is that the government isn't able to communicate effectively. It's what the government is supposed to do. I'm just trying to convey what I heard in the video. The president is a joke. The problem isn't the ACA. The problem is that the government is unable to communicate effectively. It's what the government is supposed to do."
58,38,So he says it's not a joke and that's why the NSA is using it.
59,38,That is the most ridiculous point of the article.
66,38,"He's being portrayed as a troll, but he's portrayed as one."
79,38,You should see a doctor if you can see some type of shit.
89,38,People like to wear a mask. It is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
90,38,"It was a satire by Obama, a satire from an r/Trump-skeptic, but not a movie. The same type of thing isn't what a movie is about, and it's a satire from a book."
100,38,He's wearing a mask to fight HIV. AIDS causes brain damage. It's a terrible disease. AIDS is not a virus. It's not a disease. AIDS is not a disease. You're wearing a mask because you feel it's uncomfortable and uncomfortable.
38,5,"I thought the title was about how the US is acting, and how it is being used as a joke. So yes, vaccination is a joke, but if you are concerned about the health care system as an overall body, and if you have the ability to live a life that is more than likely a joke, then you're being too repressed and it is a joke."
38,10,"The CDC is saying the CDC should not be allowed to be vaccinated because it prevents AIDS or other diseases from spreading, which is not even a joke."
38,14,This is the way I understand it. He's a dick who thinks it's a joke.
38,16,"The guy said a lot about how we are doing it. I'm talking about the fact that he's doing a good job as president. Despite that, it sounds like he has a right to be called a dick because he's doing a good job in the country. It's pretty clear he has not read the ACA and he's not going to see a doctor, so he probably doesn't want to see a doctor."
38,19,And what the president said was that he did have a role in preventing the spread of the AIDS vaccine because his wife is pregnant with her second child with the same disease.
38,20,You could be right about the CDC not being able to tell that people are sick or dying.
38,24,It's not about preventing the spread of the virus.
38,35,"Vaccination is a major health issue and has been around for hundreds of years. The reason it's still a hot topic in the media is because people haven't noticed that it's being discussed, and people are putting up with the rumors about it, but there isn't enough info to get people to buy the ACA. There are a lot of reasons why the ACA is a hot topic. Vaccination is not a fad. It's a national security issue, and is not a joke."
40,38,"There's an ad in a film where the president doesn't wear a mask to prevent HIV infection, and the ad for the president's helmet is not even on."
52,38,"The president has lied to the media about the ACA and their policy, he said his idea of health insurance was a joke. He said he was a sex offender and that he would never wear a mask. I am not saying it is a joke, but it's a joke that's a joke that isn't true, the ACA is the best way to protect kids and teachers."
58,38,"The whole ACA thing is pretty much complete crap. The ACA isn't a joke, it's the worst joke ever. The entire ACA is a joke."
59,38,"The NSA is trying to cover up what is actually a joke, and in fact is trying to cover up what is actually a joke. The article says something along the lines of: You wear a mask to prevent the spread of HIV. You're allergic to HIV. The NSA is going to have to try to stop him from getting the virus in the first place?"
66,38,The article is written by a doctor who is a doctor who worked in healthcare for years. They aren't really using his mask to help stop the spread of a virus.
79,38,The word 'troll' is not used properly in some countries. I read this in one of the first AMA's and got blown away. The wikipedia article is called 'troll' by the US gov't. The post has two lines:
89,38,I think the other comments are coming from people who don't have a good hat because they don't know how to walk and they don't know how to talk.
90,38,"I was reading a book a couple of years back, and my friends told me that this movie was a movie based on a book about the government that had no relevance in the book."
100,38,"The CDC is not saying that you're the only one with HIV. It is saying that it is not a medical condition causing any serious damage and it isn't something people will be aware of unless they've gotten a better idea about it. It is saying that he wants to try to cure the disease and is a man of great potential. I'd be very concerned about that too. He needs to see a doctor, but if he can't, he should never wear one."
38,5,"Yes, vaccination is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
38,10,Vaccination is a fad. It's a national security issue. It's a fad.
38,14,"The word ""judge"" is not being used properly in some countries."
38,16,Vaccination is a huge issue for Americans who don't have an idea of what it means to live in America.
38,19,"It’s not about the virus, it’s about the CDC putting out the CDC’s'mild warning signs' on everyone, and it’s not the joke if a candidate has a disease. The ACA is a huge issue, it just hasn’t been covered by any national legislation in decades. I don’t know if it would be a joke, but I’d say a mask is necessary to deal with it in a positive way."
38,20,It's pretty clear the CDC isn't going to be able to tell that people are sick or dying. It's not about preventing the spread of the virus.
38,24,"i agree with you that the saber mask is a fad. It isn't because it's a joke, it's because it's not a joke."
38,35,What's interesting is that a movie that was made by a politician was used to say that the President should wear a mask and not have to talk to a doctor - the author of the movie said he wears a mask to protect himself from the virus.
40,38,You can buy a helmet that has a whistle on it for the head.
52,38,"""... The president is doing the best he can. The government is trying to get a solution that works against the virus."
58,38,i think this is a good way to tell you that the ACA is actually being a joke.
59,38,Yes. We need to bring out this adolescent...
66,38,"The movie is actually an excellent book. I have no doubt that the book is an excellent book, and that you will enjoy it. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks."
79,38,"I lied and thought it was funny, but then I found it's not funny."
89,38,The people who put on a hat will likely do nothing to prevent a virus if they don't have a good hat.
90,38,There was nothing to do with the ACA. You gotta read the book.
100,38,"AIDS is a very complex illness, and it is a mental health issue, so I don't know where you are coming from. I'd just start by saying it sounds like he's having a hard time getting past this. He's being extremely emotional. He can't make any logical sense of it and he's being emotionally manipulative, making sense of it. There's a stigma attached to it - he's wearing a mask because he's been feeling sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo"
38,5,"I think the word ""jedi"" in the title is very appropriate."
38,10,Vaccination is an issue of national security because it isn't about preventing AIDS or other diseases from spreading.
38,14,Vaccination is a huge issue for Americans who don't have an idea of what it means to live in America.
38,16,That is the biggest issue in this country. The Obama Administration needs to move this message forward.
38,19,It's also hard to say what was a joke or a joke at that point.
38,20,What's the biggest issue with HIV?
38,24,"The president's trying to convince people that the ACA is a joke that the Obama administration's response to is that ""the president is trying to do everything he can to stop the ACA."""
38,35,"I know the feeling that they have a very similar idea but I also do it with a hat, not a hat."
40,38,"In the CDC's case, it's not a 'judgement' of a doctor's power. It's a 'pizza'."
52,38,CANNOTANSWER: I'm just trying to convey what I heard in the video. The president is a joke.

59,38,I don't think you understand the joke. They're trying to cover up a joke that's not about a CDC-like joke.
66,38,The movie isn't about the ACA. The author is clearly in a coma with the trolls.
79,38,"> 'If the CIA was trying to stop the spread of a virus, he would be a murderer and he would be shot."""
89,38,The reason it doesn't make sense in a good way is because the joke 'keeps people from avoiding the fun part'.
90,38,"I think the movie is satirical as the president's ""nefarious "" response in a satire would be. The movie is a movie that makes no reference to the ACA."
100,38,This is not just a medical issue.
38,5,"You're right, it is inappropriate."
38,10,"So...the movie is satire. But... besides, I don't think they can say anything about how he's being troll? They can't say a thing and they can't say anything about it."
38,14,Vaccination is a huge issue for Americans who don't have an idea of what it means to live in America. That is the biggest issue in this country.
38,16,You are putting the president in a coma with an awful attitude and the only thing a man can do is numb himself.
38,19,"The video was a joke, not a real one."

52,38,"A bit more information about the ACA, based on the commenting, I was reading the article. It is about the president and the government trying to get a solution that works against the virus."
58,38,I don't see how that is a joke in any sense. The problem is that people are afraid that a CDC agent will infect people. It's one way to stop the spread of a virus.
59,38,">We are wearing a mask. And when it's off, you're supposed to take off your mask and turn yourself in. I don't think you understand the joke."
66,38,I'm gonna give you a good reading a few weeks down the road.
79,38,It's a joke and a joke. It's just a joke.
89,38,That's a prank. But i like it.
90,38,The problem isn't that they didn't take it seriously. It's that they did the right thing.
100,38,"As a person with HIV, that’s a huge problem."
38,5,"""The joke is that people are afraid that a CDC agent will infect people."""
38,10,I believe in this movie that this is a prank.
38,14,"As a former president who's tried to make a joke about Vaccination, I find it ridiculous that the CDC and the Obama administration don't care a bit about the vaccines. The joke is a joke, a prank, and it should be considered a morality joke. The point being that he has an awful attitude and the only thing he can do is numb himself. The movie is satire."
38,16,I wouldn't want to be the one that 'pisses me off' if I were the guy who was infected with HIV/AIDS.
38,19,"The problem is not that they didn't take it seriously, it's that they did the right thing. They just wanted to stop it. The truth is, they did not do what they wanted. They're not going to cut the president off on that."
38,20,So how is it possible to be the first person to have a conversation about a vaccine?
38,24,"Is this a joke, or just a joke?"
38,35,"It's kind of like the quote ""You're in for a long day but uh... You can't go through restaraunts without a mask."""
40,38,I think that he's ignoring a lot of the ridiculous things people say in the comment. This is a joke he's trying to make himself known by making a joke about it.
52,38,'The mask act is about the government’s ability to communicate effectively. It’s what the government is supposed to do. The President has always been a joke. But I don’t think it’s a joke. The president is doing the right thing. The Obama Administration is doing the right thing.
58,38,That's a pity because the mask isn't supposed to stop the spread of a virus.
59,38,"I don't think the president is the problem. I think that you're being tyrannical here, I'm just saying, it's funny."

38,5,I would not be surprised if the presidential candidate had tried a lot of different things if he had stayed in office.
38,10,"In my opinion, 'he's wearing a mask because he feels like a dick.' That's just a joke."
38,14,So that he's trying to stop HIV? I think that's a joke because he doesn't believe it's a joke.

59,38,Is it possible to wear a mask to help prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS?
66,38,This is a fucking one of the first a few comments on Reddit i've seen in a while that I'm not sure how to read and I can't even start to write a full sentence about it.
79,38,What makes the article about Trump a joke? That it was posted on a different page.
89,38,a joke. a joke.
90,38,People have a tendency to make pranks and pranks to get their facts straight. They're just attempting to be serious.
100,38,"“The stigma attached to AIDS is a lot of people don’t get it, but they’ve been dealing with it for a long time. We have a lot of people with the same mental health issues as you. So it’s not good to be uncomfortable and uncomfortable. But it’s not really good to be comfortable with. It doesn’t get me comfortable with it. Isn’t it good that people can’t see how to live their lives.”"
38,5,"I really hate when people are getting such blatant sarcasm about Obama's response and the lack of clarity and respect he's given the guy. He does the right thing, but it's just because he wants to take the ACA seriously he hasn't seen it yet."
38,10,Vaccination is a prank because it’s a joke about the President's role in spreading the disease and not about his prank on people.
38,14,So your point here is not really correct.
38,16,There are a few nuances in that.
38,19,It would be hilarious to see how many different sides of the story get mixed up.
38,20,They’re all in the news.
38,24,"There's a whole lot of cliche and nonsense in the article (including how he was in it). He 'was just trying to convince people that it was a joke, but the president is trying to make it sound like a joke."
38,35,I don't think you understood the article so well and didn't just get caught up in it.
40,38,The President is a prankster he's trying to do something about.
52,38,Are we all getting the ACA?
58,38,"The CDC is attempting to protect people from AIDS, but is trying to help stop the spread of HIV."
59,38,"""I like the guy, but I think I can't be a doctor without a mask,"" ""Can I"" and ""Can I?"" are the two words that aren't used interchangeably by the author."
66,38,"The author of the book is clearly in a coma with the trolls. ""How do you know that you're not an author?"
79,38,"I'm gonna have to say this. I'm not saying it's a joke. I'm saying it's a joke and it's a joke. I mean the same thing. I mean, it's not a joke. I don't see it as anything."
89,38,I like the movie. I like the guy's description: 'Pete a hat and go down to a restaurant to sit in your chair and get in the bathtub with the hat on. That's a prank. People wear a hat to stop people from having sex without it. People do it to stop people from having sex without it. People do it to stop people from having sex without it. People wear it to stop people from having sex without it.
90,38,Is it a thing of the past? Because I think it is.
100,38,"The stigma a mask is like a curse, and when it gets you feeling ill, the stigma doesn’t really go away. Unless he actually has a good one to help him, then no, he’s an asshole."
38,5,"As a matter of fact, I just wanted to put this in the title."
38,10,"Vaccination is a prank, not a prank. It's a joke."
38,14,The Obama administration seems to be looking for an anti-viral attitude to work on. There's nothing wrong with that and the entire situation is not about it.
38,16,That's a good thing.
38,19,So I have a couple other questions for you :
38,20,"I agree with you on a couple of points, but it just makes me think it’s a joke and is a joke. I think the government should be able to work with the problem, which is the same to the gov."
38,24,"I know, right? The CDC are trying to stop the spread of a virus in a way that isn't a joke. A prank is about a virus. A prank that isn't a joke is not a joke, the CDC is trying to help the people vaccinate. The problem is the stigma. A prank. The CDC prank about the ACA is a joke, the CDC hat was a joke, not a joke."
38,35,"Vaccination is not a joke, it's a prank. It's a prank because it's a prank. It's a prank, not a joke. The ACA is a major health issue, and isn't a joke."
40,38,It's funny you're pointing out this.
52,38,"The issue with this is that it's a joke and that there's nothing to stop this. This is a joke about the ACA. This is an interesting subject and the US can't stop trying to stop the spread of the virus. It's the point of the ACA is that it's not about protecting people and AIDS. The article is about the ACA, but the ACA isn't about stopping the spread of the virus. It's about what the ACA is about and the CDC needs to start educating teachers."
58,38,You can't tell the difference between a joke and a joke.
59,38,I'd like to see some more of the Cannot care  about this. I'm an asshole.
66,38,I'm going to have to go back and read the book if i see a hater.
79,38,[Which is the story of the story? How is it being said. That is why people want a prank movie and don't see it as anything.
89,38,"If you don't have a hat, go to a restaraunt, or go to a hyde park."
90,38,"""The ACA is a major part of the healthcare system."
100,38,"There's an American video, The Good and the Bad about this in which they make their shit up for it by saying things like ""I want to try to get some help but you're not going to be able to help me"" and ""I want to get a new job for myself but I'm not going to get a job."""
38,5,"Vaccination isn't a joke. The CDC is a joke, but it's not a joke. It is a joke, and he should know what's going on."
38,10,What would the poster be saying in the book? Because that's what they're doing.
38,14,He could actually help you get your shit together and get the CDC to stop a viral infection.
38,16,>It's a funny thing to do.
38,19,"The CDC, whose job it is to prevent the spread of the HIV epidemic, has no right to do anything about it and is not taking it seriously."
38,20,"I'm actually not surprised that Trump can't take a job on this guy without getting his hat on. It's a good prank, and not just a prank."
38,24,"I can tell you that while the ""book"" is satirical, this is about a different thing. The CDC has done it. The CDC has done it. The CDC hasn't done it. Probably a joke about the ACA."
38,35,"I believe the whole point of the ACA is to protect people and spread awareness, and it is a big one. The ACA is a serious problem."
40,38,">I don't think the president is a prankster, but I'd say it's pretty much a joke."
52,38,"It's funny that the president is just trying to make fun of the guy, but he's still a joke."
58,38,A great example of what a prank is like.
59,38,That was the first joke I read. Then the second one came up.
66,38,I was watching the movie and the author doesn't seem to have a clue what it was about.
79,38,">“It’s funny, it’s funny that the president didn’t want to be shot.“"
89,38,I read this and was not surprised to find it.
90,38,The one in the headline says the mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
100,38,I am pretty sure his friends are still in the field.
38,5,"As the president, I can't even recall what kind of pranks Obama made. I think it's more about what Obama has said on his facebook page that really really makes it funny and that he's not going to change things in the future. The president is a prankster and I don't think he wants to change anything."
38,10,"The CDC wants to help stop a virus by sending the disease to other countries so if you don't have a mask on, you're not gonna get caught."
38,14,It's not a joke. It's a joke.
38,16,"I don't think it is funny to think the president is a prankster, but it's just a joke. It isn't funny to believe that the CDC isn't taking HIV/AIDS seriously. It isn't even a joke."
38,19,I have not read the articles.
38,20,"OP said it was the first time he said the joke was a prank, he says it sounded like a joke but no one said it was."
38,24,The CDC is not the one supplying the data for the ACA's elimination. The ACA is not a joke. This is the one that a president can't stop saying. I think they should just let the joke go and try and stop the ACA.
38,35,"What I love about these quotes is that the president's inability to speak properly in the context of a prank, like the CDC's is making fun of Trump."
40,38,"the CDC, the CDC, and the US are all trying to bring awareness to the AIDS epidemic. The whole thing is sexist and inappropriate."
52,38,"CANNOTANSWER, and CANNOTANSWER, are the CDC, the government and many other states that do not have the same legislation."
58,38,I think the only problem with masks is the fact that the president is a joke and is trying to influence policy makers to stop the spread of the virus.
59,38,The joke is a joke that is intended to tell people that it's the CDC's attempt to cover up the issue in some way and not the president himself.
66,38,"""...it is a violation of our constitutional rights. I don't see any reason to veto."""
79,38,"I don't know about you but in the context of all these jokes, I'd like to say I have a few."
89,38,"Yes, the movie was a prank but it doesn't really have any actual content. There is only one possible explanation for the movie, and they are using it in a prank, for example, and one that was just made up to get a bit of perspective."
90,38,"In a few days after being diagnosed, my dad called me to tell him ""this isn't a prank"" and it made me so embarrassed he thought the president was a prankster. Immediately after, he told me the president had made a big mistake. I got angry at him and said ""this isn't a prank."" So he said ""Oh man, the new guy is so sick I'm going to go to a doctor and we're going to have to come back and see his doctor's face."" and then"
100,38,He's an asshole because of this. I'd rather not fuck around with my mask and go to a doctors office than suffer a mental health crisis and then be caught in the act of getting a medical check done on a patient without a mask.
38,5,The only problem is that the president doesn't see a problem and wants to get the treatment and the ACA sucks.
38,10,The CDC hasn't ruled out vaccinating people. They're just putting out a joke about the vaccines.
38,14,"Vaccines aren't a joke, they're a joke. This is a joke and people are getting sick of the jokes. I'm not a liberal and I'm a liberal, but I'm a Liberal. If there's a funny joke on the internet, I'm going to have to agree with you."
38,16,It's a prank!! And your parents are pretty worried.
38,19,"The president is trying to help stop the spread of the AIDS epidemic. The ACA is a big issue, and the CDC wants to help the HIV epidemic. But the CDC is trying to stop it. The ACA is a massive issue, and this isn't an 'ACA prank' or a joke."
38,20,"He wants to change the way it is, and that's what he's doing."
38,24,"if i remember correctly the CDC apologies for not being able to help a CDC outbreak. ""I thought it was funny and i don't think it was a joke. I would like to see him get it away from me."""
38,35,The joke isn't a joke. The joke is a joke because a president is a joke.
40,38,It's just a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke because you don't think it's funny.
52,38,"if the CDC were to do this with a mask under a helmet they would be compelled to impose it on their employees, which in their opinion is not a joke."
58,38,"""As a former cdc officer, I can say that there is no problem with wearing a mask. I can see it as a way to stop the spread of a virus."","
59,38,I want to be the one that thinks this isn't a joke.
66,38,"Yes, this was about a prank."
79,38,"Basically, he's a pedophile. It is inherently a joke."
89,38,I think the thing that makes putting on a hat a prank is that it's supposed to stop people from walking. People wear it to stop people from walking because they don't know how to walk. People do it to stop people from having sex without a hat. People do it to stop people from having sex without a hat. People wear it to stop people from having sex without a hat. People wear it to stop people from having sex without a hat. There isn't a prank.
90,38,I am going to have to go to the doctor and say something similar. I've been sick and can't go in for treatment and I'm sick so I'm going to be afraid.
100,38,The stigma associated with AIDS isn't just a medical issue. It's not a mental illness.
38,5,"It's a joke. They are trying to prevent it from spreading. But the fact that they're putting it on is just a joke, not a prank."
38,10,It's a joke because it's a joke.
38,14,"OP is a fan of the ""Paradise Act"" (""Paradise Act"") and he has to respect it. ""Paradise Act"" isn't the same thing as ""Paradise Act"" unless you're talking about a sexist person. It doesn't mean anything if you have a joke or a joke, but it doesn't mean it's just a joke."""
38,16,"It's a prank. They're trying to get people to wear the hat, and it is a joke. Unless they do it for a prank, that's a prank."
38,19,Is there anything the president could've said about the ACA that was an attempt to keep the president from putting on a mask? I think you've got to admit the president is a prankster in some ways.
38,20,"I have seen some funny stuff here, but none of them are very good."
38,24,I would suggest a book written by the president about a viral virus. It's written in a way that it's not a prank and is about preventing it.
38,35,"[Porn is a joke, not a joke.](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics)"

100,38,The CDC has been telling people to stop wearing it. He's trying to convince himself that he's being a dick. He needs to get treatment.
38,5,This is the worst prank ever!
38,10,What I'm going to tell you is that it's a prank that's not even a joke. It's a joke because people are sick and cannot go to the doctor to get treated.
38,14,He was a prick for trying to make a joke. Taking off a mask to fight the AIDS is a joke.
38,16,"AIDS is a serious mental illness and this is a viral virus that is incredibly debilitating and a bad thing to deal with. Putting on a mask to protect yourself is a joke, and is an indication of the widespread infection. It is so horrible."
38,19,"""We're putting on a mask because we don't know how to do it. We're doing it because we don't know how to do it"". Is that a joke? It's a prank. It's a prank. If it's not a joke, it's a joke. And the problem is, it's a prank."

That's the right thing to do. The Obama Administration and the media are a bunch of trolls that are not legal."
