67,46,i m not against vacks mandates cuz i don t think i ll catch the cough i already had it i m against them cuz they ruin the economy get people fired and people should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force
74,46,oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that
88,46,i m going to say this about twitchcon and masks you can hate me if the state town doesn t have an mandates you can t get mad that an event doesn t not sure if sd has any mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask
90,46,yes the newest strain is soooooo contagious just bc they have a mask on their hands pics don t mean they re using it
101,46,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
46,9,There was a big debate about a mask in the US back in the day. Didn't want to make the public think they had no idea how to make people wear a mask. I thought it was fun to see it but then I realized there was a much larger problem than this.
46,12,This makes me wish we could all have that sarcasm in our hearts
46,20,Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of a virus. Please wear masks.
46,27,"OP, i cant imagine what you can do with a mask."
46,42,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

88,46,Twitchcon is a good one
90,46,"The guy wearing a mask is claiming to be the newest strain of a disease. But they say they can spread it if they are wearing a mask on their hands, which is absolutely wrong."
101,46,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
46,9,No one wants to talk about the twitchcon that happens. There is a huge problem with a fake mask in the US.
46,12,"This has nothing to do with being a person. This is about the government supplying vaccination, not the citizen. It should be pretty easy."
46,20,Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of a virus. Please wear masks.
46,27,"That's a good one, because you can wear it. But it's not a nice mask. Wearing a mask helps prevent a virus."
46,42,In my experience a mask is not a bad thing. You have to be in a different state.
56,46,oh I see. i am not joking.
67,46,"A lot of people are just too scared to wear a mask. There isn't a single policy that prohibits them, they have a very specific duty to enforce them."
74,46,"So I wear my mask, I get a hard time breathing after sitting on it for two days, my husband is terribly ill, and I'm still sick of him, and he's doing better now than I've ever done before. So I can go back to it if I'm not sick again, but I have to wear it, and I'm also getting a lot of sick."
88,46,I am not going to say anything about the CDC but this is a very interesting topic and this is a good discussion.
90,46,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
101,46,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
46,9,"If you want to be a doctor, wear a mask."
46,12,Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of a virus. Please wear masks.
46,20,"This is what happened when I was a teenager. A person who would lie and claim they were infected with the virus was infected with it. Then there were the folks that were ill from that time. I believe that, because of the public health problem they aren't getting it. I think that s the real problem, because they haven't given in yet."
46,27,"The government isn't saying it's a bad thing, but they're saying it's wrong. I know that in Georgia there are people wearing a mask. The government doesn't even want to wear it despite the fact that it's on the people."
46,42,In my experience a mask is not a bad thing. You have to be in a different state.
56,46,"He can wear a mask, but the ACA would be against it. It could also be against putting on a mask to fight off a virus."
67,46,CANNOTANSWER: I am an idiot
74,46,"i know that that is so ridiculous, i guess i should say i am sick of it too, but that just shows the level of ignorance in our society, and i have the ability to deal with it so I just need to have a look at it."
88,46,"I think it's a good thing we're talking about this with CDC. It's basically a joke in this thread, it's just not relevant to CDC, and they're obviously not concerned about the health effects of vaccinating someone."
90,46,"IANAL, but my dad says in the movie the mask's in front of me."
101,46,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
46,9,CANNOTANSWER:
46,12,CANNOTANSWER:
46,20,We have a very good doctor here. It's not necessary to have a mask on your body. You need to put on a mask to stop the spread of the virus. The mask can be used for just about anything that's being put on.
46,27,I'm not a doctor. I don't believe in the government's mandates to do anything that would make it illegal for people to wear a mask. I don't believe it's possible for people to do anything illegal like get vaccinated.
46,42,I'm gonna put up with a lot of ridiculous stuff in my head now that I'm not actually a doctor. Apparently the government isn't willing to do something that will save me from a lot of pain.
56,46,It would be against putting on a mask to fight off a virus.
67,46,I have never heard of 'The ACA is actually preventing AIDS because of the ACA'.
74,46,I think most people would just start putting their face in a strange shape so that it doesn't come off as a tad weird.
88,46,The CDC is talking about the right thing to do. It's not a coincidence. They're the one who argued that it was the right thing to do.
90,46,"CANNOTANSWER: he has HIV that he hasn't gotten in a reversible disease yet. He has a mask on his hands, but no other mask."
101,46,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
46,9,"He has HIV and is putting on a mask to stop the spread of the virus. He is wearing a mask on his hands and he was infected with the virus. Despite what the CDC says, he is still an idiot and he is an idiot because his face is strange and weird."
46,12,CANNOTANSWER was referring to the government's commitment to stop the spread of a virus.
46,20,People who lied to get vaccinated and then stayed unvaccinated are the people who are the ones who get the AIDS.
46,27,"CANNOTANSWER is a doctor. His dad is an AIDS expert, and has had a CDC doc tell him to wear a mask on his hands."
46,42,CANNOTANSWER'S THE THE MEAT
56,46,"I do not have a job, but I do have a job and I live in a suburb of NYC. I live a few blocks from the federal border, so the ACA is the only way to protect my health."
67,46,"The ""cannotadian] is an idiot and is frustrated that the government is not trying to protect him."
74,46,"[NAME] is also a part of the government, and the government doesn't want to interfere with it."
88,46,"I'm a big fan of vaccines as well, and I really, really don't want to see this kind of thing. The problem is that there is no evidence of people getting vaccinated. That's why I am afraid that the government could've just done that instead."
90,46,"They need to put more pressure on the federal government to enforce ACA, not the ACA itself."
101,46,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
46,9,"It's not like the ACA is the only way to protect a patient. It's a bit of an over-the-top thing to do, and it would have to be done as a compromise, with the government making it illegal. CDC docs don't want to interfere with it, they want to protect people that do not have it."
46,12,">The problem is that there is no evidence of people getting vaccinated. That's why I am afraid that the government could've just done that instead. They need to put more pressure on the federal government to enforce ACA, not the ACA itself."
46,20,And he still thinks this is a symptom of a disease he has already been vaccinated against.
46,27,"There's no other way to save the AIDS. You just don't have to do it, you don't have to do it."
46,42,"The people who have HIV that he hasn't got in a reversible disease already don't have to be vaccinated. It's not the disease, but the way the CDC feels about the disease."
56,46,>Is it because he's a sneeze and a jab?
67,46,"What else can you say? There's no such thing as being ""afraid to wear a mask,"" they're saying something like: ""I think people have a problem with the government but they also have a problem with the government."""
74,46,"The biggest problem we have with the government isn't the government, but the state. The state is the government. It's the federal government. It should be able to protect people from virus transmission through a program to prevent them from having it spread through blood from a mosquito. The first is not a virus that is spread through the blood of a mosquito, but it's a virus that is infecting your throat. I know that's so ridiculous, i guess i should say i am sick of it too, but that just shows the level of ignorance in our"
88,46,I'm going to sarcastic as well.
90,46,A lot of people just thought that it was a sexist idea.
101,46,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
46,9,>Is it because he's a sneeze and a jab? What else can you say?
46,12,"It's a bit of a ""cannotadian"" thing to do."
46,20,This seems like a logical argument that the federal government is stomping the public health and vaccinating people.
46,27,You're an idiot. You have no rights. The government is not allowed to impose its mandate on people who have AIDS and the government is free to refuse to do it.
46,42,"Why do you think wearing a mask is good, even if you live in another state? It's not really a good idea, and is not the first step."
56,46,I have a phobia of using my mask in the face of a fucking virus — I ve never seen a fucking virus before.
67,46,OP is a bigot and doesn't like the government.
74,46,It's not a joke. It's a lie. You don't understand what it is that people are saying.
88,46,"[I think a lot of people in this sub are just trying to justify this. Vaccines are not the right, you should not have to do it. Getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks."
90,46,CANNOTANSWER: 'Hi dad says in the movie the mask's in front of me.'
101,46,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
46,9,"So, he’s wearing a mask because he has HIV and he’s got it, he’s not infected with the virus."
46,12,"The biggest problem that we have with the government isn't the government. The state is the government. The government should be able to protect people from virus transmission through a program to prevent them from having it spread through blood from a mosquito. The first is not a virus that is spread through the blood of a mosquito, but it's a virus that is infecting your throat."
46,20,"The fact that he has a phobia of using his mask is a very interesting part of the problem. I would say he is a bigot, but he really does think it is a good idea."
46,27,There are people in the CDC that want to be vaccinated. But the ones in the CDC would be stupid if they said that would be a good idea.
46,42,"I don't know about the CDC, but I don't know much about the AIDS outbreak."
56,46,"Well the president's mask was an ACA thing, not a 'clerical act'. So you mean the government is a clone? That would be interesting to hear, but it's just some generalization."
67,46,The president is a tyrant who wants to get rid of any form of health care. CANNOTANSWER is an idiot and is frustrated that the government is not trying to protect him. The fact that the president is a tyrant who wants to get rid of any form of health care is pretty amazing.
74,46,I would put it on my face and I'd wear it for a while.
88,46,"This post has been up for a while. And it seems like it's kind of a joke. If I were in a position to help the CDC, they'd probably go on to take a look at how they can reduce the number of vaccinated Americans who get vaccinated."
90,46,"He never says, ""A lot of people just thought that it was a sexist idea.'"""
101,46,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
46,9,"It's not just the ACA, it's the government who needs to do their part."
46,12,The president is a tyrant. It's an interesting point to make:
46,20,"I think a lot of people in this sub are just trying to justify this. Vaccines are not the right, you should not have to do it."
46,27,"I think a lot of people who use ""idk why I should come to Georgia. I don't think a mask is a good idea."" or "" I'm an idiot. You have no rights. The government is not allowed to impose its mandate on people who have AIDS and the government is free to refuse to do it."""
46,42,"The issue is not the government, it is the government itself. You have to wear the mask. The federal government has the right to refuse to do anything to keep people safe. But you don't have to give the person any of these hats."
56,46,"I am an American with an ACA (Civil Immunization Act) and I am extremely concerned about the safety of my family and I need to learn to be an advocate. It is very skewed, and it does not apply to this country."
67,46,The only thing I don't understand about the health care system is how the people in the video have not explained their fears. They are saying 'the president is trying to stop AIDS' instead of 'the ACA' and that the people who are against it are trying to prevent AIDS. It's not a healthy way to help you and it's a healthy way to tell people that you have a hard time breathing. That's a different story. That doesn't mean you should do it.
74,46,The guy doesn't mean that everyone likes the idea of the hat. That's ridiculous.
88,46,"[NAME] is an actual name for a company that does a lot of things to prevent TB/STIs, but that company doesn't believe that anyone is actually getting vaccinated. Vaccines can prevent more than a handful of diseases, not only in general, but also in general."
90,46,"I don't like snarky stuff, but I like the book."
101,46,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
46,9,"I'm not sure that the CDC is giving him the right to wear a mask, but it's a way to prevent the spread of AIDS and he is not immune. And there are many other reasons as to why the government isn't trying to prevent AIDS, including how it causes the disease and whether they are preventing it."
46,12,"I don't think you understand why the CDC is so cynical, what's the point of the video? You're doing all that right, but you're saying that he is a tyrant."
46,20,"In addition to the Idk why I should come to Georgia. I'd put it on my face and I'd wear it for a while. I think that s the real problem, because they haven't given in yet.'> I think a lot of people in this sub are just trying to justify this. Vaccines are not the right, you should not have to do it."
46,27,"I am an american, and I can understand that you are being snarky. I'm not saying the president is a tyrant, but I really don't see a'simple' way to prevent the spread of AIDS."
46,42,CANNOTANSWER IS A HONORABLE TAX MAN. He has to take responsibility and protect others.

It could also be against putting on a mask to fight off a virus.', 'It would be against putting on a mask to fight off a virus.', 'I have a phobia of using my mask in the face of a fucking virus — I ve never seen a fucking virus"
67,46,"I think the video was pretty jarring and not at all realistic. I thought the article was pretty clear that there are some issues where people have no idea why they have to wear masks and they feel uncomfortable about it, but I could see why people would be so uncomfortable with it if it were real. It's more interesting that it explains why the people are scared, or that it is a healthy way to help with their own problems, and why people aren't uncomfortable with it."
74,46,I see you're probably being a bit cynical but I still don't understand how this is being interpreted. You don't know why people don't like that part of the movie but it's a nice way to say it.
88,46,"""I'm just saying that people on this sub are sometimes confused when people say I don't want to be vaccinated. I mean, I'm still in the vaccination and i'm a big fan of the CDC, but I don't think they actually care about it or the disease. I just want to know why i don't want to do it.

90,46,"No, it isn't a sexist idea. It is an excellent example of how the government treats the health care system."
101,46,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
46,9,There's nothing wrong with masks and that is not a good way to prevent the spread of a virus.
46,12,I'm gonna have to laugh at the fucking people who complain about this because they don't know what to say to you.
46,20,"Vaccines are not the right, you should not have to do it. I think a lot of people in this sub are just trying to justify this. Vaccines are not the right, you should not have to do it."
46,27,"The guy is the president. It's a good idea to put on a mask, but you are supposed to give it to him if you can, as he is the president."
46,42,Because he's not a federal employee. So he's an unemployed asshole.
56,46,"I think the article is one of the best movies of all time. It's a fact that you can't buy health insurance. The people in the video here have stated that they are against the ACA, not just the ACA. They are not making money off of it and they're not doing their jobs in the face of an AIDS epidemic and they're not a threat to health care."
67,46,I can't imagine a person who had a problem with the ACA.
74,46,I know what the heck people have to do to get to the end of this. The way it ends is a nihilism. And I don't see how any one is trying to satirize the entire movie.
88,46,Vaccines are actually the best way to stop the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of a virus. Please wear masks.
90,46,My dad has the reversible virus and it's a pretty well known viral infection that has been linked with some of the CDC's vaccines. He went to the doctor and gave the patients medical care with a reversible disease that had been linked to it's genetics.
101,46,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
46,9,"Vaccines are the best way to stop AIDS. If the CDC wants to help protect people against the virus, they have to put a lot of effort into putting it on their hands and making sure AIDS doesn't spread."
46,12,"They are not going to have an issue with vaccination, they are going to have a problem with a problem with a problem with health insurance."
46,20,The people who have said they aren't against the ACA should be vaccinated.
46,27,"> I think a lot of people in this sub are just trying to justify this. Vaccines are not the right, you should not have to do it."
46,42,"Vaccines are not the right, he should not have to do it. He is being a tyrant about not doing anything that would protect him, and he doesn't want to deal with this in the same way that other people do."
56,46,"If they were actually talking about Obama, I would think that the article is about the president saying something like that (no matter how much it's true), because he's basically the man who wants to stop the spread of a virus."
67,46,"It sounds like the president is trying to stop AIDS, and wants to get rid of any form of health care."
74,46,People are still trying to explain the meaning of the word hammer. Surely there are people that don't know what the word hammer means and don't understand it.
88,46,"As the subreddit explains, if you don't like the CDC, go to the CDC."
90,46,"The ACA does not prevent you from getting sick, it causes you to suffer and you have to go to the doctor for that. They are going to help you through all of this."

46,20,"Vaccines are not the right, you should not have to do it. Vaccines are not the right, you should not have to do it."
46,27,You're being snarky and I'm not telling a truth about this. The president is using the term 'hammer' as a tad bit offensive to the public. It makes it seem that the Obama administration wants to get rid of the ACA.
46,42,">The issue is not the government, it is the government itself. You have to wear the mask. The federal government has the right to refuse to do anything to keep people safe. But you don't have to give the person any of these hats."
56,46,"I think people should have all this information as evidence of who they are, not just someone who is not the president, and has no interest in defending the ACA. This is what I'm saying. It's a very good movie."
67,46,"The video was pretty clear that they're telling people that they're having a problem with the ACA, because they don't understand the importance of the government's policy, and the fact that the government is trying to prevent AIDS is pretty amazing."
74,46,"What was the point of a movie when people can wear their masks in the face? I mean, I was very sick at the time but it got me some bad news, and he said they had to give me a fucking mask - but then I got a hammer. I can tell you, in the movie, that they suck, but it's not exactly a joke or an actual joke."
88,46,They just want to do the same thing.

101,46,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
46,9,"Vaccines are not the right, but they are the best way to prevent AIDS, and he needs to be protected from them."
46,12,"Well, the Obama administration is also trying to protect the health and safety of people, and I'd say they should be doing what's best for them and those people should be protected."
46,20,"So, in a way, the president is saying, ""Hey man, I should come to Georgia, I'd put on a mask, I'll be able to wear it because I want to be safe, but the government is stomping the public health and vaccinating people."""
46,27,"Well you know, I don't actually know if this is true, but people aren't allowed to come in with a hat on."
46,42,"They're also trying to convince a lot of people that a vaccine is not good to protect people, and that the ACA is bad for them and they need to do more than just the same."
56,46,What are they referring to? AIDS. What the article states are just about putting a mask on in order to prevent the spread of the virus?
67,46,"> The Obama administration was trying to stop the spread of AIDS, so the US resisted changing the healthcare system. It's a strange way to put things."
74,46,Why does this movie sound satirical?

46,12,"I think you should go on a trip, and I think it's going to be a fun time. The movie really makes you think that people have to be able to make the right choice for a government to use."
46,20,That movie makes a lot of sense.
46,27,"They can't do that. They don't have to wear masks to prevent AIDS. They aren't able to wear it. It would be like a hat, you just don't want to go inside with your head out."
46,42,The ACA isn't a valid defense of the healthcare system.
56,46,i've seen a movie where a guy with a mask tells a reporter how to get the ACA passed and a woman is filmed in the mirror wearing a mask.
67,46,The only thing I can't understand about the health care system is how the people in this video have not explained their fears.
74,46,The movie's not about the government. It's about the CDC.
88,46,Vaccines are the best way to stop the spread of a virus. Please wear masks.
90,46,>I think the movie is a good example of how the government treats the health care system.

46,9,That 'd be a funny movie.
46,12,"I love how the word ""Mask you a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."" [Eight years in, I've been here.]"
46,20,Why the hell is the ACA a valid defense of the health care system?
46,27,I have a mask on and am a very good doctor. I gotta get some sleep.
46,42,Vaccines are the best way to stop the spread of a virus. Vaccines are the best way to stop AIDS and he needs to be protected from them. I think the movie makes you think that people have to be able to make the right choice for a government to use.
56,46,"I'm a woman and I wear a mask. My husband is a senator and I don't have a job, but I'm not looking for a job."
67,46,I'm really not interested in the ACA itself. And I'm not sure that the ACA was anything more than a symptom of an HIV infection and I doubt that the mask is necessary to prevent the spread. And when I read the article it's very clear that they are trying to cut the stigma associated with the virus.
74,46,It's been a couple of years since I've watched the movie. I've always been skeptical. It is one of those things where I get a tingling feeling and it is a very strange feeling.
88,46,Is it funny how the CDC didn't read the book? That makes me wonder how often people actually get vaccinated.
90,46,I think the movie is a good example of how the government treats the health care system. They've been putting pressure on the government to fix a virus.
101,46,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
46,9,Is the movie actually a funny movie?
46,12,Vaccines are the best way to stop the spread of the virus. Please wear masks.
46,20,I don't get why people are not vaccinated. They are not being medicaid. Is the ACA good? No.
46,27,The problem here is that the government doesn't think wearing a mask is a good idea. I'm surprised this movie didn't get that much coverage.
46,42,"I was there for a week when it hit me, and I just had an AIDS epidemic. It was devastating. I would probably not eat at a lot of places, or be covered, or have it. It was all that would bother me. Then I would come to work, take a fucking test for the AIDS, and I would be told to put on a mask, because I was too ill. I’d try to get the job and not try to make sure I was well. Then I would just keep it. I had a hard time."

88,46,"It's a very obvious comment about the whole ""I am a big fan of vaccines as well, and I really, really don't want to see this kind of thing."" thing (which is a bit of a weird term) is that people are not getting vaccinated. The fact that the people who got it figured out the difference was the fact that they didn't even know it was a joke. This is a very general opinion, not much of a joke. Vaccines are not the right thing."

46,9,I don't think it's a comedy but it was a little funny. I didn't know it was a movie.
46,12,That's all. The CDC's attitude is that they can't protect the public from the spread of the virus. The problem is the people aren't getting vaccinated. The problem is that the government doesn't think wearing a mask is the right thing.
46,20,"I have a mask on, and it's a huge help. I've tried it on some people, and it doesn't work."
46,27,The movie is a comedy.

46,27,Isn't that the same as saying you should be a good doctor?
46,42,"It was a joke, because it's not funny. It's not a joke. It's a joke. It's not a joke. It's not a joke."

88,46,Vaccines are not the right thing. They are not the right thing. This is a joke. I think the joke is about how the CDC is trying to stop the spread of a virus.

46,9,I don't think this movie is funny at all.
46,12,This isn't the point of the movie at all. This is the point of the movie.
46,20,It's a good movie because I think it's good and that's what it's about. It s very interesting though.
46,27,The reason a movie was not a prank is because it is a prank. That's why it's a prank.
46,42,"This is one of the best things I've read in a while. It's amazing how the people involved feel about that.

67,46,I believe you're correct that this is a very difficult topic to answer.
74,46,There are lots of other things I could tell you but I'm not really a fan of the hat. It's about the US government and the government.

74,46,"The first sentence of the article isn't really a prank, but it's what the story tells us. It's about the government's efforts to stop the spread of a disease, not the health system, and is a prank. This movie is not about the hat, but the health care system."
88,46,Vaccines are the best way to stop the spread of a virus. Please wear a mask.

46,20,I've seen this article for a while.
46,27,The movie is actually really well written. It is like the CDC and the CDC have been arguing over how to prevent a virus from spreading to people who are in danger. There is literally nothing that could have possibly been done with a hat.
46,42,A prank or a joke without being a joke?
56,46,The article was a joke. It is a joke. You don't get to read it right but the article is a joke.
67,46,It's really hard to say. The video is more about not knowing whether or not the government is actively trying to prevent the spread of AIDS.
74,46,I'm going to leave you in my place.
88,46,CDC is not the right thing to do. They are the one who argued that it was the right thing to do. Vaccines are the best way to stop the spread of a virus. You need to go to the CDC and be vaccinated.

46,20,I have been vaccinated twice and I get sick a lot.
46,27,Why did they start with hats for the AIDS resurgence? They were invented after being approved by the Obama administration by President Obama.
46,42,"I think it is better than a troll, since you have to do something. I'm not a troll, but it would be a prank for me to say that if I got a hat, I would wear one because it would be bad for me if I got the vaccine."
56,46,The whole premise of the movie is that Obama does not intend to repeal the ACA because he is just a prank to a small group of people in an effort to put on a mask. And there aren't any laws that explicitly obligate people to put on a mask to prevent a virus.
67,46,Why don't they do some thing about the ACA?
74,46,"A lot of the questions were just pointing out that ""the only person who would want to make fun of the hat is the people who make fun of them, or even just a friend."","
