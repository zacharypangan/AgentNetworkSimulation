So, you can’t make a joke or do a prank about the book in a non-comic way. It’s a prank, but it isn’t a prank"
95,90,"The idea of pranks derived from a book or book is different in terms of the nature of the prank. The movie is not a prank, but a prank. The movie is based off of the book, the movie is based on the book."
95,4,I think this is just a prank.
95,7,"That is what I was thinking. I don't like pranks. I like to make jokes. I'm not saying it's a prank. I'm saying that a prank is funny because you make a joke about something, and it isn't. I'm saying that if a prank is based off a book, it's a prank, but it's based on a book."

95,63,"It's a good thing the movie is based on a book. The person in the book is a prankster and you're a prankster. The movie doesn't sound as if it's based on a book, a prankster won't want you to read it, or it won't resemble your real life prank, or that it's not based on a book."
95,70,I'm pretty sure there is an official definition of a prank in r/raisedbyasks
95,81,This subreddit is about pranksters.

95,4,"OP, this subreddit has a lot of pranks."
95,7,Those pranks were about a book. I didn't know the movie was about a book.
95,25,It’s the definition of a prank. I don’t know how to give a sarcastic response about a prank. It’s a prank. This is a prank. A prank is a prank. This is a prank. It’s a prank because a prankster won’t want you to read the book and it’s based off of the book.
95,29,"""I've done a great job finding out what kind of movies are really the best and the best examples."""
95,34,i figured that 'is a prank' was not a prank. 'i read the book's title as 'I love the book.
95,39,I don't think people have a problem with the sarcasm in these comments. This subreddit is about pranksters.
95,40,The article is an attempt to help explain some of the underlying principles of the pranking theory:
95,45,I'm not a prankster.
95,63,It's a great example of a prank based on the book.
95,70,I don't think a prank is funny. It's just a prank. It doesn't seem to be funny in that sense.
95,81,"I don't have any ideas what that means. I have a bad feeling you're saying it's all a prank. I'm just saying that it is a prank, but it's not what a prank is about."
95,84,"This is a pretty well-known fact from the book. The book is based on the book. The guy with the mask is wearing the mask in his life. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.'', ""I love it when it's a prank, but I don't want to get a mask on the girl."
95,89,The first part of the second sentence is a prank about the movie as a prank.
95,90,"""I want to get a mask on a girl,"""
95,4,It's a prank in the sense that they're not telling the story and the people who do the prank can't just ignore it and make a bad joke.
95,7,"In this case the whole point of the article is to explain that the pranks can be funny, not be pranks. They're called pranks because it's not an idiocy."
95,25,"In this case, you're being a prankster, not a prankster."
95,29,What was the author going to say?
95,34,"I'm not the only one who thinks there's a prank in the book, but there is one I've read that I'd rather say ""This is not a prank."
95,39,I love that book. It was really funny.
95,40,What do you think about the fact that the author of the book has said the movie is one of the best movies of the book?
95,45,Then you'll know that the movie is not based on the book so the pranks aren't based on the book.
95,63,"''I love the movie, but I am hesitant to watch it unless I find myself reading something that isn't in the book, which is much more fun than it really is.""''"
95,70,The first sentence of the second sentence is a prank about a guy who wears a mask to protect himself.
95,81,"I can't believe I'm reading this again, I've never read this book, but I'm not really into any kind of books at all. I want to see it ad-link again and the movie is one of my favorite."
95,84,If a man can't go into a house and kill himself then he needs to get away from the government.
95,89,"I don't think the pranks are a prank, they're just a prank."
95,90,So you are saying that they are not pranks. Is there a subreddit that is about pranksters.
95,4,"The movie is a prank based off the book, and the pranks are about the guy putting a prank on the girl."
95,7,"""Sometimes a movie is more prank than a book."
95,25,I think the best example is :
95,29,"I haven't seen the book yet, but have some reread of the book to see if it's still relevant. I'm going to look it up, and see if it's worth it, but it's just not my kind of thing."
95,34,"*the prank is not a prank because the movie is based on the book,"
95,39,"This is a post of people asking people why they do pranks. It's been a lot of times over the years. The pranks are essentially in an attempt to get people to take out their hats and prank them into a different world. You can be a joke, you're just trying to make it sound like they aren't funny. They aren't even trying to make it funny."
95,40,"In this case, you are being a prankster."
95,45,"The best way to put a prank is to say, ""We like that it tells you about a movie that you watch in the theaters and I don't really know about."""
95,63,The whole point of the article is that pranksters are not funny.
95,70,"“Welcome, you’ve just got to go find a new friend.”"
95,81,"It's kind of hard for some people to get past being called a prank. And you may not like it, but I'll bet it doesn't sound a prank either. It's a prank because it's based on the book and it's not a prank. It's a prank because it's not a prank."
95,84,"Then the movie comes out. ""I'm hesitant to watch it unless I find myself reading something that isn't in the book."""
95,89,"a prank based on a book, based off of a movie, is a prank in this sense"
95,90,I would like to take it that he’s being sarcastic by saying that the movie is based off of the book. What’s that movie about?
95,4,I think you're trying to be a prankster. But I think the movie is pretty good.
95,7,"OP's ""loved"" movie is a prank. A prank is a joke because it's about someone's life. The first part of the book sounds fun, but not funny. The second part is about the guy's face. The third part is about the movie's face and the guy's face. The first part is about a character and the guy is wearing the mask. He is in the movie to help prevent a virus. He is wearing the mask to help prevent a virus in his life."
95,25,CANNOTANSWER:
95,29,"A prankster is an asshole, not a prankster."
95,34,"""I'm not really snarky. You're being way too literal. I think you're being way too literal."""
95,39,"> ""A prank is a prank because it's based off of a book."
95,40,"I don't know if that's actually a bad term to use. The article says a good amount about a prank, not a prank."
95,45,A prank about a prankster or the kind of guy who pranks a person because they think they are a prankster.
95,63,"""The whole point of the article is that pranksters are not funny."
95,70,"I think the movie isn't funny, it's just not funny."
95,81,prankster is a prank
95,84,"""I like it when it's a prank, but I don't want to get a mask on the girl."""
95,89,"It sounds like the pranks in the book aren't as funny as the movie, but they are more of a prank."
95,90,"... but there's a lot of pranks. I'm trying to make them a ""prank""."
