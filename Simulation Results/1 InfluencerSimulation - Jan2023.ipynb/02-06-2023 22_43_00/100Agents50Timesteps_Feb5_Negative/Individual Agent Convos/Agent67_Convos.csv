100,67,oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that
67,7,"Is a mask an expensive way to go? I don't think you should buy one because of a safety issue. I would be too if I had a mask, but I would hardly recommend it to a sick person with an infection."
67,11,"Well, not as much as the government would like you to think..."
67,14,You think the government has a mandate to kill you for doing something that isn't harmful?

67,7,There are lots of government mandates:

67,14,That snark. There are so many people in this thread who think that we are supposed to be able to choose what to wear as a safety precaution. I find that kind of response very funny. What do I do? I can't take a hard time breathing in my own mask...

67,65,"Why not just make sure you get a mask? That's the only way I could do that. Whenever I had a cough, I would have to wear one that wasn't too bad."
67,66,I had to tell the lady that she had her throat sucked from my throat so she was harmed. She said she was too scared to let her nose go and she would have to tell her husband to take off her nose. I was terrified of her face and walked off. I'm not a scientist.

67,7,"I am not a scientist and I can't read, and can't 'know' what 'Is a mask part of the measures deployed by the government' is."

67,65,I am so angry at the government for refusing to protect me. I was told that we should have the freedom to choose what to wear as a safety precaution. I have an issue with the lack of a single policy to prevent people from using a mask and having to wear one that is not too bad.

67,7,"Is it safe to wear a mask or get the jab? Because yes, it's a safety precaution."
67,11,"I think it's hard to believe that the people are going to go to the doctor when they get sick, and that if you can't get the mask, it's unsafe for you to go. But the medical providers that aren't going to take care of your illness are likely to do so, and it's probably not necessary, and it's very difficult to believe it's possible."
67,14,"It was only the government's job to stop the spread of AIDS. It's just part of the solution, and the government does not want to make it stop. It's a bad idea, but it's not even a bad one."

67,7,A lot of the government mandates say that the government doesn't like to let people have their own healthcare.

67,11,He didn't get the mask that he wanted so people can have it. He just opted to wear it.
67,14,So you're going to be a tyrant?
67,46,The only thing I don't understand about the health care system is how the people in the video have not explained their fears. They are saying 'the president is trying to stop AIDS' instead of 'the ACA' and that the people who are against it are trying to prevent AIDS.

67,46,"I think the video was pretty jarring and not at all realistic. I thought the article was pretty clear that there are some issues where people have no idea why they have to wear masks and they feel uncomfortable about it, but I could see why people would be so uncomfortable with it if it were real. It's more interesting that it explains why the people are scared, or that it is a healthy way to help with their own problems, and why people aren't uncomfortable with it."

67,11,I'm not a doctor.
67,14,The title of the video is misleading. The person is not saying what he's saying.
67,46,I believe you're correct that this is a very difficult topic to answer.
67,47,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.'' The president is an opportunistic dictator. But, he's not actually a tyrant who wants to get rid of anything because he can't do anything that is supposed to stop the spread of AIDS.'' That is the whole point of the mask. A man that does not know what the difference is is is just trying to get the world's attention and reframes his feelings."
67,65,"If a mask would prevent people from getting a cold or having to wear one that wasn't so bad, then that means they won't wear it, so they won't be able to do that. It would definitely help keep people from having more ailment. I think it's important that the people who get sick be aware of that.

67,11,"And they aren't making the right choices they are making it possible that people want the health insurance cover that will cover those costs. The government could be doing something like that if they had to buy a mask for the pain of the symptoms. But it would certainly help keep the stigma at bay. This is not going to help the situation. It's the people. They're all trying to protect the people, to protect themselves."
67,14,"The article's about the President and it's agenda, which has no place in the policy of the Obama administration."
67,46,It's really hard to say. The video is more about not knowing whether or not the government is actively trying to prevent the spread of AIDS.
67,47,The question is whether the President is a tyrant who wants to get rid of any form of health care?
67,65,"You gotta look up the title of this subreddit. The ""people who have HIV"" ad has a recurring title that is misleading, and I do think the link is misleading."
67,66,AIDS is a disease. It can be an epidemic. It isn't a disease that can be cured by having an invasive surgery to treat it.
93,67,"CANNOTANSWER says the government is not just a tyrant, but a political tyrant."
100,67,They're wearing a mask to make sure they don't get AIDS. It's a health issue that affects people and is not even a health issue in itself.
67,7,"I'd eat more of that as I get older and have my health insurance, but if I wanted to get sick I could be wearing a mask or just getting a sick person to die for free. I feel as though the government wants to save and stop the spread of a disease and if not it doesn't have a mandate."
67,11,The video is about the Obama administration and the AIDS issue. It is very misleading.
67,14,"Yes, it's a problem. The problem is that people don't know, and it's difficult to tell what that is because they're getting sick. They have to keep it under control to keep it at bay. If you want to fight AIDS, you need a mask and get a new one."
67,46,Why don't they do some thing about the ACA?
67,47,"People want to get a mask to treat people, and so are the government. The Obama administration has no obligation to change anything. The article says the president isn't the president, and the Obama administration isn't trying to stop the spread of AIDS. The article says the president is an opportunistic dictator. But, it is misleading."
67,65,Why would you get a mask? It's a really good way to keep the disease in the long run and get rid of it.
67,66,This is what you want from a post on r/legaladvice. I don't care what anyone else says about it. I'm not even joking. I think that the article is misleading.
93,67,"They can't make a claim about whether or not they were the reason that Obamacare was repealed, and in the end the president had absolutely no right to call his actions 'opportunistic' unless they were in the correct position."

67,7,There is a video of one of the presidents infected. It is on the front page of r/legaladvice.
67,11,I think it's pretty clear that the president is a tyrant who wants to destroy the American people.
67,14,I have a feeling the current government isn't really doing anything but trying to prevent or prevent spread of AIDS.
67,46,"This is about the government. Why do you think they should stop doing this? You can do things that aren't even the issue that you want to. You have a moral obligation to do it. If you do want to stop the AIDS epidemic you need to stop taking them seriously, because they're taking them seriously."
67,47,I think the article is misleading.
67,65,"No, I do not have a problem with it."
67,66,Why didn't we get an ad about the ACA so early?
93,67,CANNOTANSWER: The president is a tyrant who wants to get rid of anything because he can't do anything that is supposed to stop the spread of AIDS.
100,67,This isn't a healthy way to tell people about AIDS. The problem is that it's not healthy.

67,46,So that's a pretty good point.

67,11,...but the mask was used for other things in an effort to keep AIDS down
67,14,Because the government is trying to make AIDS go away. It doesn't stop it. And yet the ACA has an effect on the economy. There's no reason to continue with it.

93,67,The entire video is just a fucking scam. The entire article seems to be about a president that is trying to use his own agenda to protect his own country. The whole video is about a racist conspiracy to try and manipulate the American people into believing the ACA was meant to stop the spread of AIDS.
100,67,The CDC is a great organization and is a great source of money. It also encourages him to go into a doctor's office and get tested. He is the one being a dick for trying to get people to get the right ones to wear masks and to help a man who is struggling with HIV. This isn't a dick because it doesn't apply to the person he is dealing with.
67,7,I don’t believe anything is in the article. I just think he’s having a hard time believing it because of the entire article. It’s basically an excuse for the president to keep trying to change a policy that is not on the table.
67,11,AIDS has been on the rise for a long time and has been a recurring issue in many countries around the world.
67,14,"I'm not sure how to interpret this statement, but that's just a good analogy of the Obama administration. I'm guessing that the president is trying to get rid of the ACA and that he's trying to make a move to stop it?"
67,46,I've had no idea that these CDC programs were intended to help the people with HIV. But they are going to need to do something to help these people. This is a really big problem and should be addressed immediately. They are a really good and effective way of tackling the problem. The CDC has a long history of helping people with HIV and can’t help you. But the way that they are tackling AIDS is a terrible problem. I have had no idea that the CDC would help people with AIDS.
