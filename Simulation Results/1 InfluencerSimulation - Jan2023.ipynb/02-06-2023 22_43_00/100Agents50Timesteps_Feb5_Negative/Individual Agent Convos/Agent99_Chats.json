He needs to do more. The truth isn't the issue. He's an asshole, but the movie isn't a great way to look at the world. Trump needs to be a more serious and responsible person and he has the right to be a good leader.",
    "The author argues that there's a reason the government tries to stop the spread of the virus (as opposed to the threat of the virus) by requiring him to wear a mask. It's an interesting article, but isn't a great way to look at the world, it's a great way to look at the world.",
