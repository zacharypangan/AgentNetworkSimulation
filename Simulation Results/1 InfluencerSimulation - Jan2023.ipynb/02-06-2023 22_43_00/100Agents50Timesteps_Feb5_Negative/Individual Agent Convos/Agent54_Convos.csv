59,54,I have an OOC about a friend of mine who has gone to a school in Georgia and he was a spokesman on a number of different aspects of the vaccine. His friend has no idea about the program.
62,54,"The reason he wasn't vaccinated was because his vaccinated cousin wasn't the only one to have a virus. I think this is more of a case of the government saying to make people wear a mask because they have a virus, like he's saying he has a virus."
68,54,Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.

68,54,My boss does not say what I say. He just says: 'There's a law that says what I say to someone who says it. That's not how people do it.'
72,54,They're trying to delegitimize the power of the people. They're doing it.
79,54,That is exactly how it is with a man who does this. It's actually really cool. It just sucks when you're being called a liar and then you get some of this weird talk of a politician who can't even afford to wear a mask.
82,54,The law is a way to get out and prevent other people from going into danger.
84,54,Is this part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
85,54,"No way, OP. I can see where this is coming from. I have no idea why people would do the same thing in Georgia."
54,51,There is a bunch of people in my class that are allergic to the virus.
56,54,The article describes the government saying it is against wearing a mask in order to prevent the spread of a virulent disease in the military. That's an interesting fact.
59,54,"In my opinion, the guy is being nitpicky. There are a lot of misconceptions about the USA, and in general, it's easy to see why these nitpicks are so prevalent. It seems that the government isn't in a position to prevent this, but rather they're willing to take the stance that being able to do the right thing and the wrong thing isn't the right thing to do."
62,54,>They have to ban the right to wear a mask when the public is exposed to a virus.
68,54,"I think that's pretty reasonable. They should have put a hat on the shirt, because if they didn't, they'd get the slammer."
72,54,It's a shame that a federal agency doesn't have the resources to adequately do everything they can to prevent the spread of the virus. They are also using false information and are making things worse.
79,54,"I'd argue that this isn't a joke, but a remark about the government allowing it a few months before it goes into effect."

72,54,"This is a very very important point to be making, as they are not in the right to prevent the spread of the virus."
79,54,The government narcissists will never put up with any such a joke. But they'll always get a laugh out of it when they're not wearing the mask.
82,54,This is the first time I've ever heard a word that implies a person is not allowed to wear a mask. It's a thing.
84,54,So you like the idea that this guy needs to have some sort of restraining order? Because there's a good chance he's on it and you don't want to be that guy. You might also like this sub.

He needs to be at the vet in GA to get the vaccinated. If the doctor didn't know, they will not want to make it."
54,51,"They need to keep the mask in place. Until then, the government cannot ban a person from wearing it, so this isn't the issue."
56,54,> The whole government has a lot of work to do.
59,54,"As someone who's had HIV in the past, I don't blame you. I'm allergic to HIV and have a virus and can't help myself. I'm not a doctor, so I don't know how many vaccines I could possibly have on hand."

It's not about how a mask works. It's about why people don't want to give them something to talk about. It's about why people don't want to make a joke."
68,54,A sexist joke is a joke. The law is a joke. It's a joke.
72,54,the fact that people have become so uncomfortable with the idea that being able to prevent the spread of a virus isn't a joke is a sign that it doesn't support the right of the government.
79,54,"The government isn't doing anything to stop it. It's not a joke. I have a few comments about it: Yes, the mask will be used in the public. But the truth is that it was invented in the 80s."
82,54,CANNOTANSWER (r-cdc): The ACA prohibits a large number of people from wearing a mask. That's just a big piece of the puzzle.
84,54,"I love the story of the guy wearing the mask and trying to get in contact with him. I'm really sorry about his sickness, he's going to get sick and he needs to get vaccinated."
85,54,"I would like to know if you are a fan of the Obama administration, or if you are a fan of the Republicans."
54,51,"The NSA says that the act prohibits people from wearing a mask when they are not exposed to a virus. The reason is that they are being very forceful, and that it was invented in the 80s."
56,54,"As an American who went through this, and is sickened by a lack of public education, it is an extremely sad story. This is why I don't trust my family members enough to firmly believe the president has a role in our country."
59,54,There's an Australian video where the NSA is trying to get a lot of people involved. They have some information on how it works.
62,54,I am actually a little sad about the ACA.
68,54,I think it is a prank. It's not a joke. It's a joke.

84,54,"This is a very serious case. Its actually an ongoing issue that has been on the news for a few years now and it is not a big deal, just another case of a lack of awareness in the media."
85,54,A lot of people in Georgia are going to want to do the same thing in Georgia because a number of them think it is a great idea and have it spread. They're also going to want to prevent the spread of HIV in Georgia because people think it's a great idea. They want to stop it because they think the government is trying to fix it and the people are actually going to want to do it because they want to do it and because they don't like the democrats.

62,54,"If you stab someone with a pen, are they a criminal?"
68,54,Exactly what my friend said. He said the same thing about the CDC and people he was in contact with. He said it is only a joke because the CDC was not interested in helping with the epidemic and so the CDC is not in charge of preventing them from getting sick or hurt.

I think the CDC is trying to do all the best they can to stop the spread of AIDS. I don't think it's necessary. I think it's probably a good idea to wear a hat. That ''is a joke.

72,54,"The CDC isn't actually doing anything to prevent the spread of the virus. The only reason it isn't a joke is because of it. They are making the same excuse that was used for the AIDS epidemic, because they do not believe it is a joke. They are making the same excuse that they're making to stop the spread of AIDS."
79,54,"I've never seen a joke where the president says ""We don't need a prank because they don't have the resources."" But I do see the prank as a joke and the CDC is trying to prevent a virus."

85,54,Is it possible that you're trying to be a bit snide? Because I've gotten my share of jokes from this and a lot of them are a bit untrue.
54,51,I'm not against the ACA but I'm against the act because it is inherently racist. The act was created to stop the spread of the virus. The bill was not in any way intended to stop the spread of the virus.
56,54,>I'm more than happy to call him an idiot for being a prankster.
59,54,"The article is satire of the Obama administration trying to show how important it is to the public and how important it is to the public, including the ability to have an opinion on any of the policies that are being introduced on the public health front.

85,54,"It's a joke. I think that's a bit unfair, but not that a joke is a joke."
54,51,"As someone who grew up in a Jewish family that has been infected with HIV, I can confirm this: The US government has made it impossible to stop the spread of HIV. So it is now easier to prevent the spread of it. And it is a joke."
56,54,I’m very pleased to see this.
