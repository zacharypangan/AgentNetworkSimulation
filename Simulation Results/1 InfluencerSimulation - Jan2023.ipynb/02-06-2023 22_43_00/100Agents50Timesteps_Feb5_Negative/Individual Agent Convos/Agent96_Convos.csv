96,33,"It is a thing. Every person who doesn't wear a mask does this. Everyone in the country should do so because of the rule that it is a violation of health care, that is to say, the whole government is the government.

96,61,"CANNOTANSWER is the first of many to mention that the NSA is taking responsibility for ""spooky and cruel"" incidents that affect people. ""It's a joke, but a joke."""
97,96,I really love how he got all the comments that came out before the whole comment thread started... I am actually not a politician. I hate that you are being downvoted. I have the feeling you are just a clown.
96,33,"It doesn't make a difference if the victim is on the Internet (i.e. the internet. ) or if the victim is on the internet. If the victim is on a television, they may not see the message. If it isn't on the Internet, they might not know the message, so they don't read it."
96,40,CANNOTANSWER says the NSA has the power to stop the spread of a virus. It’s a joke.
96,61,I can't tell if you are wrong or I'm just a prankster. I think the word 'no' is wrong. That's why the guy got a mask in his car and told him to put on a mask in order to stop the spread of the virus.
97,96,">The only thing I see about the ""masked"" thing is that the masked man is actually a coach. If you really like a coach, you should definitely try and get a good head mask. If you really like a coach, you should definitely try and get a good head mask."
96,33,What you're saying is that the Obama administration has been inundated with stories of this sort of hysteria.
96,40,"It’s the whole point of the joke a lot. I don’t see it as a prank. The point is that there are very few things a prankster can’t fix, so it’s not the best solution. That’s why this is a joke. It’s not a joke. It’s a joke."
96,61,"As a former NSA volunteer, I can't say for sure whether this would be a joke, or what it's about."
97,96,"I have not seen any of these comments. I don't think anyone in my college or professional soccer team has ever even said the term ""the guy who has no idea what is going on here""."
96,33,">""I don't know what is wrong with the NSA, but in many cases, the president is the troll in disguise to make sure that you're not involved."""
96,40,"No, the NSA is not a prank."
96,61,"As a former NSA volunteer, I can't say for sure whether this would be a joke, or what it's about."
97,96,"It doesn't make any sense. You're a coach, not a politician."
96,33,The story itself seems to me like it’s a troll.

96,61,"Yes, this is a prank. It is not a joke. It's not a joke. It's a joke. It's not a joke. It's a joke."
97,96,"I think the President is being a troll and a troll for his actions, and the lack of proper protection, is what's causing the problem."
96,33,"It's a joke because it's a joke, but it's actually a joke."
96,40,The President has given him a pretty nifty tip.
96,61,No one is giving a fuck about it. It's not a joke.
97,96,>I am a university professor and I've read a lot of stuff and it just doesn't feel that way. I think we need to do something about it.

96,40,"CANNOTANSWER: 'If you don't know what a mask looks like in a game, they just want a head sleeve or something. In addition to being a part of the NSA to stop the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask outside or in your car alone is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.'"
96,61,">The first part of the article was ""The President of the United States of America"" and is a major part of the spooky shit that affects people."
97,96,"I'm not a politician and I've never said that i don't really know much about politics. I like to be a sportsman, but what about you?"
96,33,"CANNOTANSWER is a former NSA volunteer and a current student at New York University. She threw a football at a coach in the game with a mask, and one of her players jumped on her shoulder with it. Is there anything else besides a mask that carries a virus?"
