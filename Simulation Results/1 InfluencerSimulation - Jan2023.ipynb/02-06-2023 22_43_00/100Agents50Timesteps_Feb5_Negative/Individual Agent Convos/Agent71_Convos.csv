101,71,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
71,49,It isn't a crime if you are not wearing a mask as much as the other players. The CDC also states that if a person has a dilated skull or a weakened skull they are more likely to be on the verge of contracting a virus.
71,61,Oh really? What if they got vaccinated with the newest strain of a virus?
77,71,"The first time I ever sat on a computer reading this I thought it said ""yes the newest strain is soooooo contagious just bc they have a mask on their hands pics don't mean they re using it"""
81,71,i m not against vacks mandates cuz they ruin the economy get people fired and people should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force says the woman that wears the mask to protect herself lmao well dear the gun works the mask doesn t i love coaching however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops i
87,71,You're not a good human being and you're not a good human being. You're a good human being and your life is being threatened by viruses.
88,71,"I hate when the CDC calls people stupid when they don t have mandates, but I like the way people say you can t do it, you cant do it for the same reasons."
101,71,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
71,49,"I'm not sure what they mean by ""It'sn't a crime if you are not wearing a mask as much as the other players."" I am sure you are confused."

77,71,"I'm gonna be the last of these people, I want a good mask to protect me."
81,71,I think the truth is that it doesn't matter what it's in public.
87,71,putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i've done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things. I like the first one. It's also one of the dumbest things i've ever done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things.
88,71,TIL: I'm going to say this about Twitchcon and masks you can hate me if the state town doesn't have an mandates you can't get mad that an event doesn't have an mandates. I want to bring you a mask that i will wear to work and not one that i wear to school or work I've been there. Getting vaccines has been very successful and I would say that most people have no idea what a booster is. Is that a question that gets answered all the time?
101,71,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
71,49,A CDC statement. No mask.
71,61,"I don't like that the CDC calls people stupid when they don't have mandates, but I think that's more a'my opinion is'that someone who has a senile virus is a ""misogynist"" than a ""good human being."" It's a very hard, unscientific opinion."
77,71,"Well, you can't make that statement. In fact, the article suggests that they have tried putting on a mask to help protect the people who want to spread it, with the intent of encouraging people to wear a mask if it's not safe and it actually works."
81,71,The NSA has been supporting the CDC since the 18th century.
87,71,"The only thing that bothers me is that when you wear a mask the people around you aren't preventing the spread of viruses, so they aren't being inhumane. There are two sides to that argument."
88,71,Is it a question that gets answered all the time?
101,71,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
71,49,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.Oh really? What if they got vaccinated with the newest strain of a virus?
71,61,"I think you need to read the article, a syllable of the same title and then re-read it.

77,71,"As the original article said, wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.You have to resign and then get a new job. I feel you, but I'm curious to know what the difference is?"

88,71,Isn't that a question that gets answered all the time?
101,71,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
71,49,"The CDC, by the way, have been able to make a point to that the people who are on the verge of contracting a virus should be able to use it in public and on all the other devices they have. The fact that these companies aren't making this claim is probably because they are able to use a sarcastic term for the actual threat of a virus."
71,61,"I mean, I really do like it, but what the guys doing aren't doing anything to stop it."
77,71,>You have to resign and then get a new job.
81,71,"It's been a while, but I hope people will understand that the people defending the NSA and the ACA don't do anything about it unless they have to wear a mask."
87,71,"I'd be so hesitant to read a bunch of this kind of stuff in public, as I think they would be too uncomfortable to read."
88,71,"Vaccines are not the right, you should not have to do it. The actual problem is how many people wear masks, and when it happens, they die. Getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks."
101,71,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
71,49,"The article doesn't say how the CDC says it is the best way to stop the spread of a virus, or what you're describing it as. It states that the CDC does not recommend a mask in any way, and there is not much evidence to suggest that it will stop it."
71,61,"It's called an ""epoch."""
77,71,I just want to know why they're even going to resign and find a new job. Why can't they use the same masks?

87,71,I just say that when I get home I don’t know what to do unless I’m out of town.
88,71,The question is a joke about a fucking virus.
101,71,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
71,49,I think the title says it all.
71,61,Is this some sort of joke about a senile virus?
77,71,Why is the president not wearing a mask?
81,71,I don't think you understand the issue but what it means is that you need to explain this in terms of a joke or that you're not being sexist.
87,71,That's a strange line.
88,71,Its not really a ACA thing.
101,71,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
71,49,I like you. You seem to have an understanding of how government works.
71,61,"I'm not saying that it's a joke, but I'm referencing what you're describing in your title. That's what it means."
77,71,"I think the biggest issue here is that the government has no interest in making the country look bad, and a government tries to do so."
81,71,">I think we need to get rid of the ""no mask"" rule for those places, but there aren't enough ways to prevent it."
87,71,"I read this in an ad. And read it as ""I'd be so hesitant to read a bunch of this kind of stuff in public, as I think they would be too uncomfortable to read."""
88,71,"I was actually in my 20s for a year. I went to a TB/STI event and was vaccinated by the CDC. I told a guy from school he hates when he is a TB fan. I got a vaccination for that, too. He said he didn't like it, he thought it was just a joke because he isn't a fan. I told him not to have to go, because he's not a fan."
101,71,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
71,49,So you went to a TB/STI event and was vaccinated? That was what you said!
71,61,"The people wearing the masks that are used are narcissistic. I don't know about any examples, but in general I'd think they'd be funny if someone was just sitting there doing nothing that made me uncomfortable."
77,71,This sounds like a pretty reasonable question to ask when it comes to the issue of the mask. Those are all pretty decent ones. But it's not a satire.

101,71,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.

This is not really a joke, it's a joke, and it doesn't really sound like a satire at all."
71,61,"I'm not sure you are a ""superfan"" but you've clearly never read the title of the article. It's not a satire."

77,71,"I mean, I would like to say that the article is a satire on the idea that the people who actually want to get vaccinated should have a mask on."
81,71,I think this is a good point.
87,71,"I read a lot of this post and thought it was pretty good, but I can't say it's an appropriate title to say that. Is it a joke?"
