27,11,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
27,12,"The people who wear the mask don't get their masks off, but they're trying to make it illegal, because they are not wearing a mask. They just aren't doing it a big favor."
27,14,"It was written on a t shirt, so no one is wearing it!"
27,16,"OP, this post has been a lot better."
27,21,The mask is worn to protect a guy who isn't actually pregnant by the mask.
27,25,i have to wear a mask all the time in my life
27,26,"My first thought was ""that's weird!"" But when I read about it again, I thought it was part of the national conversation I thought of about being out in the open when I was at a bar in the morning - the implication being that the mask is a part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
34,27,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
42,27,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

60,27,People will be on their way to the president's house to watch a movie... so here's how it was done in 2012
65,27,It doesn’t matter if the school chose to opt out.
69,27,That's a terrible thing to say.. fuck the democrats.
82,27,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
94,27,"The fact that you're being denied a choice is more disturbing than that of the fact that it's not wearing a mask, and not the law, but rather the fact that you know this."
27,8,"No it doesn't because it is illegal to wear a mask. If you see a guy whose mouth is like a hole in his neck, the nose would start to open."
27,11,You must know that your choice to wear a mask to prevent you from being infected with a virus isn't really yours.
27,12,The mask is not the thing that can make your breath come out of your head. It is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
27,14,"I'm a Republican. If you are a Republican, you aren't in the right. I think you are the one that's getting the wrong kind of shit right now."
27,16,My favorite part of the film is when people are talking about how the masks made his breathing easier and you can see in the distance that he's doing something wrong. He was told that he was having a lupus and wasn't pregnant. I think his point is that he is actually the father of a lupus and wants to get rid of the mask because it doesn't stop the spread of the virus.
27,21,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.If you look under your mask and say something like that, it makes me sick :/ Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

27,25,You need a cnn story to show how much of this topic is relevant to this thread.
27,26,"Well, it's probably just a little too far into the political lexicon to see why the government has to implement a fucking and all the laws he and the others are not making sense because the government is a puppet."
34,27,"People have been wearing it for a lot of years, and most people don't understand that it is illegal. I would be surprised if this happened and some other news outlets just do. I know this is funny because i think it's because people are making fun of that because of how crazy they are. It's like they are all doing something ridiculous, and people have to be completely mad that someone is wearing a mask because they don't have to."

44,27,"I don't think this is what you said. We need a government that is capable of taking a vaccine and protecting people from HIV, and not the federal government."
46,27,"That's a good one, because you can wear it. But it's not a nice mask. Wearing a mask helps prevent a virus."
50,27,"The CDC (Did you hear about that before you said it? ), they have a list of anti-viral measures in place. If anyone has said anything they'll come back and do it on their own without further notice."
51,27,"The government has a policy to prevent that. It doesn't help anyone else, the government has to help them."
58,27,"I think it was more the fact that the helmets are very difficult to take off when you're playing on a game, as you'll need to have some protection. Wearing a mask is very difficult because it doesn't necessarily have to be an absolute requirement of a physical performance. But the fact that you can't wear a mask is a big sign that you're having trouble with the system and you want to continue to work to get yourself in better shape. Obviously if you're going to wear a mask, it's going to be ineffective."
60,27,Apparently they're wearing the order because the teacher erect a huge scar on the girl's head.
65,27,This is about the CDC not the health departments themselves.
69,27,That's a terrible thing to say.. fuck the democrats.
82,27,> Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
94,27,I think we should wear the same mask every time someone else wants to wear a mask. I can't believe this has never been done.
27,8,"I think it's funny that a guy in a wheelchair can't tell you he's sick, and he isn't going to be able to eat him."
27,11,"> We need a government that is capable of taking a vaccine and protecting people from HIV, and not the federal government."
27,12,"This thread is about ""fucking the government"" right now, not ""doing it a big favor""."
27,14,I'm glad the government hasn't rolled over. There hasn't been an attack on public health in nearly a decade.
27,16,"I can't believe the CDC hasn't done this. I don't see why people want to wear a mask, so they need to cut the costs of the vaccine and the cost of the mask to fix it."
27,21,"So, what's the difference between that and yours? Do you mean what is so absurd that this is a non issue here?"
27,25,"That's an incredibly incredibly hard problem to solve. But I think I'd like to say something along the lines of ""I wear a mask every time someone else wants to wear a mask."" It's like a pretty normal thing to do."
27,26,I’ve always wanted the government to be a safe place for people to play games and enjoy themselves. I’ve always wanted to be comfortable in my mask and be able to sit in public when people are around. My point is that people are not allowed to do anything else. I believe we should all aspire to be free as much as we can because of our government. I’m sure everyone in this country would be able to.
34,27,I want to read that 
42,27,"I think the reason why that was sarcastic was because this shit is so offensive. I figured you were merely saying something sarcastic, so that you would understand it."
44,27,"I think we need a government that is capable of taking a vaccine and protecting people from HIV, and not the federal government."
46,27,"The government isn't saying it's a bad thing, but they're saying it's wrong. I know that in Georgia there are people wearing a mask. The government doesn't even want to wear it despite the fact that it's on the people."
50,27,The president is the one doing a terrible job of putting the CDC on a pedestal.
51,27,"> I believe there is a good reason the mask could be worn, but if the public health system weren't effective at stopping this, it wouldn't be a good idea to wear a mask."
58,27,> I'm actually not a sportsman so I don't have any idea what this is about...
60,27,Vaccines are not the right. You should not have to do it. You shouldn't have a medical necessity to do it. Isn't it just a thing of the past where a man has a reversible disease and a medical mask?
65,27,"They have a very strong public health system and they would need to get a 'failure' to do the best they can, regardless of a'mask' or not. They must be accountable for this, including their actions."
69,27,You've already gotten a pretty decent amount of attention from the people who've come to the comments so far. I'm sorry that this is so old news and there are not many that will actually listen to it.
82,27,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
94,27,[What is the problem? How do I make them look? Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of a virus. I think we should wear the same mask every time someone else wants to wear a mask.
27,8,"This thread is about fucking the government, not ""doing it a big favor""."
27,11,> I know that in Georgia there are people wearing a mask. The government doesn't even want to wear it despite the fact that it's on the people. The president is the one doing a terrible job of putting the CDC on a pedestal.
27,12,"It is illegal, the mask makes you smell like blood. You can't feel it because it's a odor that comes out when you're wearing it. The government is not doing this."
27,14,"It's a funny sarcastic ad for the fact that the ""public health"" is a state and not a federal agency."
27,16,It's a different thing. But I'm not sure what you're trying to say is relevant.
27,21,Vaccines are not the right. People are in no position to wear them. The only option is to take one.
27,25,"It's called a ""scary question"" and I've seen many people say the same thing, but not the same thing. So the same thing happened to me when a guy in a wheelchair couldn't tell me he's sick, and he isn't going to be able to eat him."
27,26,"CANNOTANSWER: The government isn’t saying it’s a bad thing, but they’re saying it’s wrong. I want to read that I think the reason why that was sarcastic was because this shit is so offensive. I think we should all aspire to be free as much as we can because of our government."
34,27,"I figured that when someone did it, they would take care of it themselves and not have to wear a mask."
42,27,I love the idea of wearing a mask and I am glad that he does not play a lot.
44,27,"It's not a big problem. It's a very serious problem. The government is trying to make a better public health system that is insufficient in protecting our health and health. We need a government that is capable of taking a vaccine and protecting people from HIV, and not the federal government."
46,27,I'm not a doctor. I don't believe in the government's mandates to do anything that would make it illegal for people to wear a mask. I don't believe it's possible for people to do anything illegal like get vaccinated.
50,27,I do not have a good understanding of that because I don't think the article is stating that there is some sort of a lack of proper protection. I firmly believe that vaccines do nothing to stop the spread of the virus. The president is in the wrong.
51,27,They aren't telling you that this is the kind of thing that should be covered by the law unless the law requires the person to show up and prove that he's a threat to the public's health. This means there aren't people who would be willing to talk about it if they didn't want to wear a mask and would like to get vaccinated.
58,27,"The article suggests that the US government is doing everything for national security. It's not ""helping"" with the spread of the virus."
60,27,Vaccines are not the right. You should not have to do it. You shouldn't have a medical necessity to do it. Isn't it just a thing of the past where a man has a reversible disease and a medical mask?
65,27,"You can't even get a mask on your own neck while being vaccinated - there's nothing you can do, and the public health agency can't make a mistake when they can't make it on your neck and even then they can't even do it on your own neck."
69,27,I'm the one that posted it.
82,27,"I would like to put a red flag in this thread: ""Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."""
94,27,What does being a cop have to do with getting a man to be wearing a mask?
27,8,"""What does being a cop have to do with getting a man to be wearing a mask?"
27,11,"I'm a cop, and the CDC is not about the right. There's a lot of things going on here."
27,12,"It’s a big red flag, but this is the same shit in the U.S. (It’s a state.)"
27,14,"I'm a big anti AIDS activist, but this sounds pretty stupid. They're talking about anti AIDS. Vaccines are a threat to human health, not protecting people."
27,16,It's funny how this is actually a red flag in this thread:
27,21,Isn't it just a thing of the past where a man has a reversible disease and a medical mask?
27,25,I have had my doctors say that the mask is illegal and it is the best thing to do.
27,26,It's a shame to read. People think the federal government is a puppet and don't get the benefit of the doubt because of the fear of the CDC and not because of the government. The federal government is the puppet.
34,27,"There are tons of videos from the movie, and I love it. Its a fun one and I love it. Its a really logical response to the entire ""We need to be forced to wear a mask because we don't need to."", ""I see where you're coming from. I like to call football a game and I love playing. I get that, I feel like it's too easy, but hey i do. I am just being silly."", ""It seems like it's too difficult."""
42,27,"If it is a joke, it isn't a joke."
44,27,> Because they're promoting falsehoods to support the government's attempts to get the government involved and to stop them.
46,27,"CANNOTANSWER is a doctor. His dad is an AIDS expert, and has had a CDC doc tell him to wear a mask on his hands."
50,27,"""As a former American who has also tried to fight a viral infection, I firmly believe that vaccines do nothing to stop the spread of the virus. The president is in the wrong."
51,27,The FBI hating on the government for this is a big red flag. They shouldn't be talking about any of it. This isn't an ACA case. It's an Obama Administration case.
58,27,"This is not a bad thing, but I would like to add that it is more difficult than what most people would consider to be a safety issue."
60,27,"I would rather have a friend who has a reversible disease and a medical mask than a guy who has a reversible disease, even though his mask is on his hands."
65,27,I've been vaccinated all the time. You have no need to get a mask or a hat. You need a helmet.
69,27,I'm sure if they were working against the CDC they would have been better off as a dick than the CIA.
82,27,"I'm trying to work with a lawyer to find a way to work around this issue. I know this sounds ridiculous, but it seems like an absolute bad idea."
94,27,"As a government employee I know that this is the case in most cases and I'm not sure why, but he has his own problems to be aware of. This is a case of his own ignorance that should be addressed by an attorney, not a cop."
27,8,That is the same part of the message that the CDC is trying to send us to the USA and it’s on the national news and there is no time for them to change.
27,11,"""What does being a cop have to do with getting a man to be wearing a mask?"""
27,12,I am an American. A doctor who is a doctor.
27,14,Vaccines do not stop the spread of a virus.
27,16,The movie sounds great. I can understand your frustration. The way it works in other states would be pretty crazy. You aren't going to be able to do anything about it.
27,21,I'm a police officer in a large office in the states that are the source of the virus.
27,25,"Basically if I was the president of the US, I would be wearing a mask. I think it's just a joke, but not one that's a joke."
27,26,I mean it's not all of it but its a lot of the same as wearing a hat and getting vaccinated and you're getting a lot of people to do it in the process.
34,27,"a lot of people don't realize that the government is in place to prevent the spread of a virus. The problem is how many people wear masks, and when it happens, they die."
42,27,"If it is a joke, it isn't a joke. This is a common misconception I've encountered in any public health situation - the lack of a health care provider who cares enough to do all of the right things without needing a mask."
44,27,OP is the one who started it. OP said that the CDC is the only public health agency in the nation that provides protection for people who do not wear a mask. They don't really have any information on the CDC or any other government agency.
46,27,"There's no other way to save the AIDS. You just don't have to do it, you don't have to do it."
50,27,i think the president is in the wrong.
51,27,> We wear masks to fight the flu. So what you'd do when you get home? Why don't you just sit on the sofa and make a joke?
58,27,So what the OP just said is that his own opinion is invalid despite the fact that he's a member of the NSA. That's just ridiculous if you don't have any good reason to believe this.
60,27,"The president of the United States of America, who has lived through the epidemic, is going to be a hero. He will be seen with the public as well as others and will be remembered for his stance on the matter. That is a pretty common misconception."
65,27,"It's pretty amazing that the CDC isn't willing to work with patients who aren't in a position to provide proper protection to the public, in fact, the program is supposed to be effective for the people who are."
69,27,"Well, I'm fairly certain OP read the article and thought ""You should wear a mask in your car alone your gullible and submissive not traits you want to project."" Well, I know that the CDC is getting a lot of the blame for how it's used."
82,27,The first thing I thought when I saw the video was: I was very concerned about the ACA.
94,27,"You can't do that. This is the first time I've encountered in any public health situation where I'm going to do this. This is what emigration is, and what's important in your opinion."
27,8,"> ""We wear masks to fight the flu. So what you'd do when you get home? Why don't you just sit on the sofa and make a joke?"""
27,11,It seems like an issue that they're not interested in. I think you're on to something.
27,12,"So what if I were the president of the US, I would wear a mask, and make the joke? I would go into the CDC to buy the ad and get a real life copy of a tv show that he's working on and not worrying about his health."
27,14,"Well, there's nothing to be ashamed of, and we're not allowed to call them that."
27,16,What do I get for not wearing a mask?
27,21,The CDC is getting a lot of blame for how it's used.
27,25,Is the ACA a law? The CDC will not provide protection for people without a mask?
27,26,"I think it was the CDC, and the CDC, and the federal government who created this?"
34,27,Its an absurd and a sarcastic stance.
42,27,That's so hard to understand.
44,27,This guy is a prick. They're making fun of us.
46,27,You're an idiot. You have no rights. The government is not allowed to impose its mandate on people who have AIDS and the government is free to refuse to do it.
50,27,"In a sense, it's a kind of stupid joke."
51,27,Isn't this the kind of thing that should be covered by the law?
58,27,"The IPC is supposed to have a ""security team"" to ensure that all players wear masks. They also have a ""security squad"" to help prevent the spread of the disease."
60,27,The Obama administration isn't going to do anything about the Obama ACA because they don't want the people to suffer.
65,27,There are so many factors affecting public health that they're almost certainly not going to change anything.
69,27,The only thing that matters to the CDC is that it doesn't work.
82,27,Is he wearing a mask because it would prevent people from getting HIV?
94,27,I think the problem here is that a government is not responsible for the spread of a virus.
27,8,"The government can and does tell the public that the people with HIV do not have immunity to any of the symptoms. It is not their choice to act like they aren't a threat to public health, but a government-made law, that they have a mandate to stop people from getting HIV."
27,11,"I'm surprised that you didn't read it. It's the government that is responsible for the spread of a virus, not the CDC. You are making a lot of jokes."
27,12,"The government isn't responsible for the spread of HIV, but it is the people who are."
27,14,"That would probably be an easy way to get the people to laugh, especially as the government isn't going to listen. It's the same in a few ways:"
27,16,I would like to point out the fact that the people in the interview didn't say anything and they didn't even go out on stage. The CDC is taking a lot of credit for this and even for them not taking it seriously.
27,21,"I think the Obama Administration is being a little too liberal. If the CDC had to pay for an insurance company to cover their costs if they didn't comply, it wouldn't have been a good idea to do so."
27,25,"I think it's crazy that there's not one person who is actually legally free to vote, and the ACA will prevent people from getting HIV if they have a mask. And I think the ACA's supposed to prevent people from getting HIV and it is illegal. And that doesn't seem to apply to him."
27,26,The CDC isn't going to do anything about the ACA because they don't want the people to suffer.
34,27,"I would have liked to see this - for now, the entire story is very logical."
42,27,">I think the other commenters are pointing out that ''this is not a joke. It's a great book about a guy who slammed his post into his head, like a real guy who was a pro game coach. Isn't the head mask part of the system?"
44,27,"""Was this a big problem?"""
46,27,There are people in the CDC that want to be vaccinated. But the ones in the CDC would be stupid if they said that would be a good idea.
50,27,"> I think the president is in the wrong. No, I'm not suggesting that the government is bad, it's the fact that the govt is. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
51,27,You can't wear a mask when your doctor asks you to. The best way to stop the virus is to stop it.
58,27,"I've played with players that don't wear a mask or wear it properly under a helmet, and some of the players have been 'not wearing a mask' or 'not wearing a mask properly under a helmet'. Obviously, if you want to continue working, I'd rather have a good time than trying to figure it out, as that's where the problems lie."""
60,27,"I'm going to say that this seems rather ridiculous. You're not being a hero, that is all. The president is making fun of the US, so I can't say you're being a hero. The govt is making fun of the people who are a hero."
65,27,I agree with you on the CDC. It's like an AIDS joke. A CDC member questioned the safety of a person who has been vaccinated for AIDS. They questioned whether or not their treatment of the patient should be given a proper antibiotic before being vaccinated or not. They aren't able to say for sure what type of vaccine they use or not.
69,27,CDC is getting a lot of the blame for how it's used. Unless it's a very big shill or she's a big twat or something. The government is the one doing all of the work. I am a Republican and a conservative.
82,27,"CANNOTANSWER (r-cdc): ""People wearing a mask to prevent the spread of HIV. It's only a problem if they can't get away with it."""
94,27,"You don't know what to do. You can't do it. The answer is in the 'If you can't help me, I'm going to come home to say goodbye to my wife'' (I don't want to ask 'Why don't you try to change my mind'), and the answer is that you're going to be asked if you can change my mind."
27,8,There is a major issue here.
27,11,"This has become a big issue in government policy in recent years. There have been multiple cases of the president threatening to put the CDC on a pedestal, even when there is no such thing."
27,12,"CANNOTANSWER (r-cdc): ""People wearing a mask to prevent the spread of HIV. It's only a problem if they can't get away with it."" You don't know what to do.

27,14,"It is the people, not the government, that are making jokes about AIDS. They are not a threat to human health."
27,16,"You gotta remember this: It's an interesting story, it's a good one, and it's been on for a while now."
27,21,People are being a little too liberal to know what to do when they are vaccinated.
27,25,The CDC is going to fuck up the ACA.
27,26,I think it's the same thing as a joke about a politician who slammmed his post into his head.

50,27,"It's a joke, but they're not talking about what's actually going on. And it is. But in this case the joke is actually a joke. The president doesn't really know what to do and it just feels awkward because his life is ruined."
51,27,>There is a difference between being a joke and being a dick. '...The ACA prohibits the use of other medicines a person may use to get AIDS. It’s an anti-vaccine one.

94,27,"It's a joke that the NSA has become more like the government, and that's why it's in the post, not in the post."
27,8,"In my experience, this is the worst joke I’ve seen. It makes people naive, not naive. If it’s a joke, then it’s a joke. It’s a joke. It’s a joke."
27,11,Vaccines are not health issues. They are not health issues.
27,12,"You don't really know what to do. The answer is that you're going to be asked if you can change your mind. The answer is in the 'If you can't help me, I'm going to come home to say goodbye to my wife'' (I don't want to ask if you can change my mind)."
27,14,"Well, I do work in a healthcare field, so I can't tell you how to do that, but I do know some other people who will have had to work for more than a decade."
27,16,It doesn't mean that the CDC is trying to get people to be a good doctor. It means that a certain percentage of people do not have access to all of their medications.
27,21,AIDS is no joke. It's a lot of fun.

27,26,"The CDC doesn't have a restraining order, they've only ever had one."
34,27,Vaccines are the best way to prevent the spread of a virus.
42,27,CANNOTANSWER'S comment was a joke. The author was trying to get rid of the ACA by putting a mask on a person's face. The whole thing isn't a joke.
44,27,"Do you think there was a problem here or that it is a prank? I can imagine that it's really a joke, but it's a prank. You're not being naive here. You're being a prank because you don't like the ACA, you're being a prank."
46,27,The reason a movie was not a prank is because it is a prank. That's why it's a prank.
50,27,The CDC has nothing to do with the AIDS virus. I believe the mask is a part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
51,27,I don't have much of an answer for what you are saying. I feel like it's a pretty simple question to ask what the ACA is.
58,27,"I have a new job and a new job. I don't know about you but the president is very nice. But I'm not sure what he wants to do and what it would be like for someone like him to do that. I think he's one of the most important figures in the world. Honestly, that's something he doesn't do."
60,27,That movie is not a joke.
65,27,I don't even have a passport nor have a restraining order. I only have a passport and a restraining order.
69,27,"I'm in the U.S. Army. I've done things I'm never going to do, but the things you've mentioned are all things that people think are wrong. The fact that the President isn't a snob is a good sign to tell someone that they are wrong."
82,27,I'm really confused as to how it has affected the people in Australia. I think it has a huge negative connotation to him that he was trying to do the right thing.
94,27,I don't get it. The CDC is not responsible for the spread of a virus.
27,8,"The answer is that you’re going to be asked if you can change your mind. The answer is in the 'If you can’t help me, I’m going to come home to say goodbye to my wife'’ (I don’t want to ask if you can change your mind)."
27,11,"As someone who is in the Army, I'd be extremely surprised if the president is a snob for actually being a prankster and putting up with it. Especially considering what he did for the CDC."
27,12,It is also illegal to put a mask on a person's face. It is also a prank. It was a joke.
27,14,"My first experience of the CDC being a puppet is that they were trying to get rid of the ACA. But because they are trying to push the issue through, the government is going to continue to do what it isn't doing."
27,16,"As I've said, it's very sad to know that this is the first time I have ever heard this joke."
27,21,I have a CDC restraining order and I think the article is the best.
27,25,I can't say for sure what you're trying to say but this is the worst joke I've seen.
27,26,"""My first thought was ""That’s weird!""

46,27,You're probably wondering why we're seeing a resurgence of AIDS.
50,27,Having a face mask isn't a good idea in any way.

94,27,"Vaccination is a good idea, the CDC and the CIA have little to do with it. I don't get it. The CIA isn't a government. They are an independent organization. Wearing a mask is the best way to stop the spread of a virus. Please wear masks."
27,8,I'm a veteran of a non-profit organization that's worked in the CDC. I'm not sure what I would do without a mask.
27,11,I just read about this recently and it made me wonder if I could remember any of the funny things he did for CDC. I know some of the jokes that are in here.
27,12,He could have stayed home and watched the game for the rest of his life.
27,14,The CDC is trying to pass an ACA without the consent of an Australian doctor. It is a joke. And it is an attempt to stop the spread of a virus.

42,27,The CDC has been trying to make a rape joke about the ACA.
44,27,It's not a joke. It's a joke.

50,27,I am pretty sure the author of the story is a troll. The author is a troll. He's trying to make us think that the ACA is the right thing to do.
51,27,">I'm not an attorney nor am I a lawyer. I'm a doctor. In order to address the issue of an anti-virus virus, the CDC needs to adopt a new vaccine and develop new drugs that can combat them."
58,27,I don't like you for not reading the article.
60,27,"So you're assuming you're not an expert? I'm assuming you're the only one pointing this out because you didn't say that a few years back, so you're really sure that the ACA is a joke? Or at least one that's pretty egregious because that's where most people are pointing this out."
65,27,He doesn't own the government. It's about how a mask protects someone's health and helps prevent the spread of the disease.
69,27,People get tired of the hat joke. That's one of the reasons the government is taking away the CDC.
82,27,It's an issue for people to have a voice. The ACA doesn't protect people from getting infected. The ACA is the only thing that stops them from getting infected. They do not give people access to a subsidized healthcare program that they should need for their own health.
94,27,"I'm not an attorney, but I know how CIA and CDC operate, and they seem very obnoxious."
27,8,I've read some pretty funny articles on a lot of things.
27,11,CANNOTANSWER : (http://www.dcc.gov.au/dcc/r/dcc/topics/advices/comment/7/26/dc/shp_cs_ac.pdf)
27,12,I have seen one commenter prank a bit about AIDS and a few of the jokes are pretty funny. I'd like to know if this is one of them.
27,14,You read a bunch of jokes in a nutshell.
27,16,"No matter how you define the phrase, the problem is with the government hating you and making it a prank. That’s the most important part of the problem."
27,21,This is why I think the 'As an Army Spokesman' quote doesn't fit the narrative of the article.
27,25,"A lot of the CDC and CDC nonsense is out of line. They can't have anything egregious about it, or are being politically incorrect, or they can't have something funny. They're not trying to make people think that the ACA is a joke. They're just trying to make people think it's right. They just have no idea what they're talking about."
27,26,>I think we should all aspire to be free as much as we can because of our government.
34,27,The article suggests that a new AIDS vaccine may be available for people who are already infected with a virus. I don't know why they're going to prank on the government or tell jokes in the next couple of years.
42,27,"It's just a joke. It is just a joke. It is just a joke, but it doesn't seem like it should be. It is not."
44,27,I mean I don't really think this is a prank. It's an adage to wear a hat.
46,27,The movie is actually really well written. It is like the CDC and the CDC have been arguing over how to prevent a virus from spreading to people who are in danger. There is literally nothing that could have possibly been done with a hat.
50,27,The ACA is definitely a prank. And the ACA has to be really bad to have a public health system that is ineffective.
51,27,">[the CDC is making a film about the AIDS virus, which the CDC doesn't even want to do anymore. I think you are making an inaccurate assumption. I think the president should be doing the right thing and respecting the rules."
58,27,"This is a story about a prank involving a public school system. A lot of people, at least the one who started as a sportsman, are not wearing masks or being worn properly under a helmet. There is a joke about people wearing masks, but this is just a joke. The article says it is a prank, the CDC is doing everything for national security. It is not helping with the spread of the virus. It is a joke, and I don't know what you are talking about. But when someone does not like this,"
60,27,A lot of people are upset because of the ACA. It's not a joke. It's just a joke. People just don't care about the ACA.

94,27,"CDC and CDC has a monopoly on the government, but there is no legal obligation to control the NSA. The CDC is not the government. The CDC is a pawn. The CIA and CDC are not government entities. The CIA and CIA are not independent organizations."
27,8,"""When a CDC prank was made, everyone just thought they were being funny."""
27,11,I think that this is the joke that's getting all the attention it needs.
27,12,In order for this to be a joke he needs to wear a mask and not wear a mask. The CDC is a pawn. It's their job to protect the people.
27,14,I don't know why someone isn't reeking of the word joke. I would say this isn't a joke. The word joke isn't a prank. I don't think it's funny.
27,16,"[Wilson, [Cannot_none] was on the same page about the ACA (The CDC and CDC are not independent organizations. The CIA and CDC are not independent organizations.

27,26,I believe the point was to make it more clear that people have a right to their health if they choose to not pay for them.
34,27,You're basically being a prankster. I don't think the CDC is going to change anything.

44,27,I don't understand what you mean by 'fucking a joke'. It's just an adage to say the government isn't helping people or the government does not care.
46,27,Why did they start with hats for the AIDS resurgence? They were invented after being approved by the Obama administration by President Obama.
50,27,"The ACA, not the ACA, is a joke."
51,27,"""What? If you wear a mask because it is not a joke, and it’s a joke then the president isn’t a joke."""
58,27,The ACA is a joke. But it is a joke.
60,27,The whole ACA thing is just a joke.
65,27,This is one of those times that people should be aware of the sex act and be in an environment that supports it.
69,27,"This hat is just a hat, and that hat is more offensive than the other one"
82,27,I'm not sure what to make of the video but I am sure a lot of the people in the video are either not aware of the ACA or do not like it. It sounds like the one person who said something was right or wrong.
94,27,"The government doesn't have a duty to stop the spread of a virus and therefore they shouldn't be an independent organization. They aren't the government, because if you have a job and a job you don't have a duty to prevent it."
27,8,"I think the ACA was an incredibly stupid prank. If there is one big problem, the ACA is a joke."
27,11,"i'm the same way, it's more of a joke."
27,12,People who can't wear a mask don't need to wear a mask. CDC and CDC are not independent organizations. The CDC and CDC are not independent entities. The CDC and CDC are not independent entities.
27,14,It’s a prank.
27,16,"I'm just going to be the first to say that I'm not sure what you are going to say in this situation. The whole point of this is that it's not an obvious joke, and I'm sorry. This is a joke, and I'm not saying this is a prank, but a joke is not a joke. You need to tell yourself that this is a joke, not some prank."
27,21,The word 'prick' doesn't really sound like the same thing as 'Prankster'
27,25,I was in my 30's when I decided to change jobs because a mask is the best way to prevent the spread of HIV. This is my first time having to wear a mask as I couldn't stand the whole virus thing.
27,26,That's a good point but I still find it offensive. The idea of the ACA is ridiculous and the CDC is just making fun of it.
34,27,This is a joke. This is a joke. This is a joke. This is a joke. This is a joke. This is a joke. It is a joke. This is a joke. It is a joke. This is a joke.
42,27,"The only difference between a joke and a joke is that the ACA is a joke. It isn't a joke, but it has a purpose and can be a joke."
44,27,"I'm not sure what you're trying to say, because a lot of things can be funny to be told."
46,27,I know that in Georgia there are people wearing a mask. The government doesn't even want to wear it despite the fact that it's on the people.

60,27,"I'm an anti-vaccination activist, but they also don't care for the ACA. They don't care about the government. They don't care about the people. They don't care about the government."
65,27,There's also a funny one about a NSA agent being able to make a joke about being able to buy a mask and a restraining order in a govt hospital. He says that they're using the CDC's AIDS information to help prevent spread of AIDS.
69,27,Why are the hat jokes so offensive? They aren't even a joke. They just make them.
82,27,Why is wearing a mask illegal?
94,27,"It seems like a pretty good way to prevent someone who has a virus in their life from coming and going, as a private citizen."

27,16,"If a doctor didn't consent to the use of a mask, the doctor would have been able to refuse the offer of a vaccination and a restraining order. The CDC doesn't seem to care about the people at all."

27,26,The article does address the ACA. It is the ACA that will prevent the spread of AIDS. It is the ACA that will prevent the spread of AIDS.
34,27,"I'm not going to delve into this further. The story itself is a joke, a joke, but this one is a joke. This one is just a joke. I really appreciate the satire."
42,27,"That's a bit too much, I can't stand this idea of a joke on the internet."
44,27,Is a mask a joke or an adage?
46,27,I've had two pranks with him over the years. He went to a doctor and told me it was a good idea to wear a mask in Georgia. We're going to have to go with a hat and be vaccinated. I have a hat on and I like it.
50,27,"In many countries the vaccines are mandatory. But the government is trying to manipulate the public opinion. So, people have to think about what to do. If you're not in the minority, that may be the way to go. The president can't really put the mask on the white house. If you're a white male, he could probably wear his mask in the white house."
51,27,Is the joke the best way to stop it? Because the mask actually prevents AIDS. I’m just so envious of this as a joke.
58,27,It's also very ridiculous that someone is being forced to wear a mask when they don't really care about protecting themselves from the flu.
60,27,"Obamacare is so fucked up, the govt needs to keep it."
65,27,"I fucking understand you being the only one who doesn't understand this and is not aware of the dangers of AIDS. If you think it's sexist to use a mask to prevent AIDS, don't be angry at him."
69,27,>I think people don't get the joke. They get the CDC to take care of it. It's not just a prank. It's a joke. I think people don't get the joke. They get the CDC to take care of it.

But it is an interesting and funny story that comes out of a conversation with the person you're interviewing (and you), but the government is attempting to manipulate you into accepting of that, and then a prank, and you get"
27,21,"I was reading about 'Phobianosis' in the U.S. and I didn't realize that it wasn't a joke. My friend said that it was a joke because she's a prankster. And when she said that the CDC is making a joke it's because it's an ""I am trying to make the right move to stop the spread of HIV."""

65,27,I don't understand why you are being so mad. This is just one of many things. I don't know why you're being so naive and ridiculous.

44,27,Why do you think the ACA is a joke? It's not. The ACA isn't a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.
46,27,So the entire movie was a prank. A prank is a joke. And it was a prank in the context of the hat.

94,27,"Vaccination is not legal, the government is a pawn."
27,8,What was the joke? Did you read the article?
27,11,There is a huge dissent. It's funny that there's a single government in power that is able to pass ACA without the consent of a doctor.
27,12,I just want to say that the CDC has a big red flag that they're trying to pass an ACA without consent.
27,14,It is a joke and it's not actually a joke. It's a joke.
27,16,It is a prank. But the CDC is doing nothing. It is a joke. That is the point of it. That is not a joke. The CDC isn’t doing anything.

46,27,A prank that's not a joke.
50,27,I am pretty sure the author is a troll. The author is a troll. He's trying to make us think that the ACA is the right thing to do.

27,12,I think that the main reason that it's a joke is because it's a joke is because they don't want to get away with it.
27,14,CANNOTANSWER is an agnostic cynicism who thinks that he's a dick and a joke is funny. It's his personal opinion of the CDC and this is a ridiculous prank if he is a politician.

27,21,My wife has had an infection with a mask at her work. She's a cop. I don't have a restraining order. I don't have a mask. I wear one. My mother was in her early 20s and she got sick because her husband told her.
27,25,"I can't think of any hat joke that the author has ever written on my behalf. That is blatantly racist and it is not ""common"" that a prank is so stupid it has a real meaning."

They're not the person who's going to use it. The problem is that the ACA isn't the right thing to do."
34,27,"This is an interesting story. I stumbled into a thread on a site that talks about how the people who do this are pranksters who are doing it. People with AIDS don't just get a mask, they get a hysterical, prank like attitude and behavior. They want it to be as funny as the shit they are talking about."
42,27,CANNOTANSWER is a USN
44,27,It's funny the president wants a cure for AIDS and the ACA is an adage to tell us that if you aren't on the right path you're being a prankster.
46,27,"There are a lot of times in the US people that believe that ""as long as they have the hat on"" is a prank, it's not actually a prank."
50,27,What's the point of this piece of nonsense?
51,27,"I believe that when he tries to bring it up to the world, he's actually trying to get everyone on board. It's not a joke, he's trying to get all the people involved to vote for him instead of being in a tizzy over it."

27,16,"I can tell you something... this guy, this guy. this is something I wouldn't want to hear. this is something that's been going on for a while and just kind of boggles my mind."
27,21,"It seems the president isn't actually getting a restraining order or something to do with the ACA. The CDC is trying to pass an ACA that doesn't include a restraining order, and instead of the ACA, it's using the ACA as a prank that was originally intended to be a prank that the CDC was trying to pass and that the ACA's a joke which makes a prank impossible to avoid."
27,25,"In other words, the ACA has no legal meaning at all. They're not the reason to do it. They're the reason people want to be able to eat in public, and a way to prevent people from getting HIV is not the reason the ACA is being fucked up."
27,26,There is a big difference between a hat and a mask.

42,27,"I'm not a rapist. I think you could tell me the meaning behind the word ""joke."""
44,27,The CDC isn't the only one in the country that is providing protection for people with a mask. They are promoting falsehoods to make fun of people. That's the only reason we have this adage in the first place i suppose.
46,27,Are you a snarky teen who believes it is wrong?
50,27,So...the CDC and the CDC don't even have an article on that?
51,27,> The whole idea of wearing a mask is not a joke.
58,27,I do a lot of reading.
60,27,You've been told that the whole concept of a ACA is a joke. And it's a joke. It's a joke. And it is.
65,27,"So, this is a joke."
69,27,"That’s what they were trying to do when they were trying to help people, and that was very important."
82,27,[NAME] said on his post that this isn't an issue with healthcare. (He is not saying any of the things in his post are wrong) he is just saying people who wear masks aren't the worst but the most dangerous ones.
94,27,"''My favorite is the ones where I have to keep my own and ask for my own health insurance and/or yours if I can do anything for them, so I don't get a chance to work.'''''It seems like a pretty good way to prevent someone who has a virus in their life from coming and going, as a private citizen.'''I'm not too concerned about the question of why do we have the CDC or the CIA?"
27,8,"Because they're the ones making fun of the ACA. You don't know any joke about the ACA, but the CDC is trying to be a joke about the ACA. 'I don't think that's what the ACA is a joke.'"
27,11,No one reeks of humor. It's the president trying to get a restraining order.
27,12,There are several people in this thread who want to tell this story. I have never seen this.
27,14,It's funny because they're not even on a pedestal at the moment.
27,16,The point of this is that people are uncomfortable with the government that is trying to do things that aren't obvious and that the government is trying to get people to change their mind.
27,21,I think you missed the point.
27,25,"It is a joke. I'm a bit confused because I can't remember the first time i wore a mask, but after reading this, it sounds like I should take a stab at it..."
27,26,You're trying to be a troll.
34,27,It's also a joke about pranksters who want the government to be a joke.
42,27,CanNOTANSWER'' is an American politician and I'm not a rapist. I think you could tell me the meaning behind the word joke.''
44,27,"In the ACA, it was used in reference to AIDS. That's the kind of thing that you'd essentially have to 'get' a dick if you want to get a mask."
46,27,"CANNOTANSWER is a doctor. His dad is an AIDS expert, and has had a CDC doc tell him to wear a mask on his hands."
50,27,It seems like the president will do this to me.
51,27,CANNOTANSWER: The ACA prohibits the use of other medicines a person may use to get AIDS. It's an anti-vaccine one.
58,27,"The article says that the CDC is doing everything for national security. It is not ""helping"" with the spread of the virus."
60,27,"Yes, and no, that's not a joke."
65,27,"> ""Then if it isn't illegal to use a mask, we should stop."""
69,27,"I think the best way to put it is to tell the reporter, and not get downvoted or voted. I have read that most of the comments are 'just a joke', so I guess I'm going to go ahead and tell them. Then I will make a point that if you don't get it, you're not gonna get it. Then I'll say something like ""The White House has no choice but to stop implementing this."" That's a pretty good way to give the president the opportunity to get what the president needs."
82,27,"The article is misleading because it has been written by an American, not a Chinese."
94,27,"Vaccination isn't a legal issue, but it's an act that's important to keep in mind when determining who is the best for their health."
27,8,"The President of the United States has been elected for a very long time. So the question that has popped into my mind was, How do you think it should be a joke? Is this one a joke?"
27,11,"As a military person, I'm very, very surprised the president is a snob for being a prankster and putting up with it. There are several people in this thread who want to tell this story."
27,12,I like the joke. I just don't see how it would be a joke in a situation where if you can't tell a prank it is going to be a joke and that's not going to work. I don't think people want to be forced to stop this nonsense.
27,14,I don't know about you but I think you're doing a good job of finding some humor.
27,16,It's a joke and I'm not a doctor. I don't know much about the CDC. It is just a joke. But people can't get a restraining order on a joke.
27,21,I don't see anything wrong with the president putting up with a joke about the ACA.
27,25,I think we should stop making jokes about 'the president' and the ACA.
27,26,The people that've tried to argue against the ACA are idiots.
34,27,"It's not a prank, it's an observation. The CDC has said that people with AIDS are going to die, or that people who don't get a vaccinated are going to die, unless they have a doctor present to protect them from it."
42,27,"If it's not a joke, a rapist is a pedophile. It's not a joke. It's a rape joke."
44,27,It is a joke because a joke that is based on a joke is not a joke. A joke is about people wearing a mask to stop the spread of AIDS.
46,27,I think you figured out how to make a joke.
50,27,I'm very confused about the CDC. I think the CDC is trying to manipulate the public opinion. This article is actually a joke.
51,27,And that's just because the Obama administration is doing what is called an Obamaesque retaliation and it's not a joke. It's not the ACA or any other government program.
58,27,"I think the article goes out of context and is ambiguous. A lot of people who believe that the ACA is a joke are being condescending about it and are confused by it. A lot of people are saying that the ACA is not necessary in terms of preventing HIV or preventing the spread of HIV. Moreover, the ACA is meant to be used in terms of preventing HIV - which is not the case."
60,27,This is the one time I read the article about what it is like when you start looking for things that the country doesn't like. It was a joke to make sure a politician could be seen as a hero.
