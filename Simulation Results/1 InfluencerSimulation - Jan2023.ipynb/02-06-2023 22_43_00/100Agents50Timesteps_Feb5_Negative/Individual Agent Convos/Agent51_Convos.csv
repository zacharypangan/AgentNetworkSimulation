61,51,I am not a very competent person but I think it would be a great idea if the government had to implement a new set of safety measures to keep the population out of the hood.

84,51,"I am very sorry but you have to play with the same team and you are also not required to wear a helmet. I am just gonna tell you the truth, in my case I just do not wear a helmet, and not a helmet, so I will be a new coach. I am gonna teach my new coach how to deal with this nonsense. If you have to work with a coach, then he needs to be able to work on his own skills."

51,27,"The government has a policy to prevent that. It doesn't help anyone else, the government has to help them."
51,45,I feel like the word mask is too presumptuous for people who like their job. It would be bad.
52,51,"I don't know what the issue is here - I don't believe there is a good reason the mask could be worn, but if the public health system weren't effective at stopping this, it wouldn't be a good idea to wear a mask."
54,51,"Exactly, wearing a mask to prevent a fever is a huge symptom of the flu. You don't have to wear a mask in order to prevent it."
56,51,I think it a 'Bird Man' thing. I don't think it means anything.
61,51,"It's called the ""moask to be vaccinated and let us get that to you ""."
64,51,"I don't understand why they don't use the word ""vaccination"" because it makes people sick or unable to live properly and therefore shouldn't exist."

72,51,"It doesn't matter what it's in public, it matters in private. You can't say it, it's just your personal opinion."
75,51,"Well, you have the right to go wherever you want and not go anywhere that requires you to wear a mask, but I also have the right to go if the gov't asks for your permission to wear a mask."
81,51,"I read that as 'you should be in public. You are going to be sacked and have to leave georgia.' I read that as 'I wear my mask when i am in public lawmaker who isn't wearing his mask in public says', 'You are going to be sacked and have to leave georgia.'"
84,51,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

51,45,I've heard people talking about that a few times before and this thread has gotten really serious.
52,51,Why are you asking what the new rules are?
54,51,"As a man, I have never seen the mask that people wear in public, but it is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
56,51,They're not asking the military to give a fair shot in the arm. They are asking why they're not doing it.
61,51,I just can't stand being asked to wear a mask when I'm wearing a mask to prevent a viral infection and to prevent the spread of it.
64,51,...and I'm gonna add a little more. I think this should be on the top of my top 5 lists.
70,51,"Its a different rooster than the rooster, which is a real nerd film about a nerd."
72,51,"In this case it's not possible to keep a'machete' from spreading in your home, you're allowed to wear a mask. So the people who want to wear a mask need to find ways to get vaccinated."
75,51,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
81,51,You want to see a wiki page?
84,51,"It's the only thing I can think of that should be said. I'm sick, sick, and can't change the rules."
87,51,I think that's a great line...
94,51,"It's not a bad idea, but I'm not saying it's bad, but it's still a good idea. I think this is a good idea, but why should we go to the police? Because you're trying to get a police report because that is what the FBI's job is."
51,5,I've seen a bit of this.
51,22,This is on the top of my top five lists.
51,27,They aren't telling you that this is the kind of thing that should be covered by the law unless the law requires the person to show up and prove that he's a threat to the public's health. This means there aren't people who would be willing to talk about it if they didn't want to wear a mask and would like to get vaccinated.
51,45,They need to start taking responsibility for the health care system for the citizens.
52,51,"I'm a fan of the ACA, and I'm very familiar with all the rules. This isn't a joke, though."
54,51,There is a bunch of people in my class that are allergic to the virus.
56,51,"I have a very very low tolerance of the ACA, and it's a pretty big sneeze and jab. It's a great idea, but it's not a good idea. I'm sure there are other ways to prevent people from getting sick, so you'll be able to wear a mask at work."
61,51,I don't think there is a joke with that.
64,51,"...and, I'm gonna add a little more. I think this should be on the top of my top 5 lists."
70,51,The movie seems like a film about a man who likes to talk about health issues in general.
72,51,I've been out of this hysteria for a few years. It's been a lot of fun to go see a TV documentary. It's the best part about that.
75,51,Vaccines are not an unavoidable part of the program. You can be more than a vaccination at a time and still be vaccinated.
81,51,"I'm going to go a little deeper, but I want to say that what is being said in this post is really sexist and I cant agree with it."
84,51,We wear masks to fight the flu.
87,51,So what you'd do when you get home? Why don't you just sit on the sofa and make a joke?
94,51,"In that case, I'd go and get a police report, which is also a good thing because it's the same thing as asking them to report you if they have anything wrong with your mask."
51,5,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.You want to see a wiki page? It's the only thing I can think of that should be said. I'm sick, sick, and can't change the rules."
51,22,I've seen a couple people with allergies and this is definitely on my top 5 list.
51,27,The FBI hating on the government for this is a big red flag. They shouldn't be talking about any of it. This isn't an ACA case. It's an Obama Administration case.
51,45,I don't think there is a joke with that. It's very funny and I don't agree with what people are saying.
52,51,"I'm a fan of the ACA, and I'm very familiar with all the rules. This isn't a joke, though. I'm a fan of the ACA, and I'm very familiar with all the rules. This isn't a joke, though."

61,51,"The joke was made because the CDC didn't have mandates to get vaccines, and they only wanted to get the doctors to make sure that the vaccines wore off properly. But I think that was the CDC's responsibility, and his not being a good health care provider."
64,51,I think the problem is that these people aren't going to be able to fight the virus for decades. This is the biggest problem the government is trying to help.
70,51,Why do you think this movie is so funny?
72,51,"Considering the fact that the mask is actually part of the measures deployed by the government, it doesn't surprise me that they're not going to change their course."
75,51,"I was talking about the NSA, not the vaccines. And the vaccines."
81,51,I don't agree with it because it's wrong. It's a lie that gets you to leave the country and is not a joke.
84,51,"The government is trying to stop this from happening, but it's not. The national guard is putting too much pressure on their people, and they are trying to stop the virus spreading."
87,51,The joke itself isn't funny. It's just one of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
94,51,You haven't gotten to know that the NSA is responsible for the spread of disease?
51,5,We need more people like you to do this. The NSA and the government shouldn't have to do something about it.
51,22,This is so funny. The only thing I can think of that should be said.
51,27,> We wear masks to fight the flu. So what you'd do when you get home? Why don't you just sit on the sofa and make a joke?
51,45,Is there a good enough reason to be concerned about this?
52,51,"I love the article about the ACA, I’m a fan of the ACA, and I’m very familiar with all the rules."
54,51,They have to ban the right to wear a mask when the public is exposed to a virus.
56,51,Is it because he's a sneeze and a jab? The article is on this website. It does not quote anything cited.

But I think that was the CDC's responsibility, and his not being a good health care provider. You're a man a man of your word."
64,51,"So it's not only a joke, it's the same as if the government wants to have a vaccine for the next gen of a disease."
70,51,There's no real way to know what you're getting into. Just a basic understanding of what a prank is.
72,51,"People don't think the mask is the only solution to SARS. The virus is being spread in public and private, while people don't believe that people with masks are going to get SARS."
75,51,Why isn't the CDC a part of the program to stop the spread of AIDS?
81,51,"I want to recommend you read the book 'I'm a man: My friend and I did something similar. I was in my room and the whole thing was a shitshow, and everyone was super nice and chatty. I have a few friends who wear masks because they are so painful and they don't get to do that."
84,51,The first part is very clever. It catches you off guard.

51,22,We've done this with no problems. My ex got sick and a guy in a van was in a lot of trouble. The guy is not funny at all.

72,51,"You're going to have to agree with people that don't agree with you, because it's a real problem. People are going to have to be completely different about this, and this isn't going to be an issue for them. They will all be uncomfortable and have to have to be in a state of shock and horror. It's not as if the government isn't in control of things that aren't safe to them. They're going to be a big problem if they don't want to have to take the precautions that they need to"
75,51,"They are promoting a falsehood. They are trying to make it illegal by making them illegal, which is misleading. They are just trying to use falsehoods that will help stop the spread of AIDS."
81,51,"There is a story here about a doctor who was wearing a mask in front of his locker room. I didn't mean the mask because he said that it made him look like a fool and made him look like a stupid man. The doctor said ""as in a doctor isn't a doctor... the mask doesn't get you to look at me or the mask makes you look ugly."""
84,51,The best way to stop the virus is to do something about it.
87,51,"I've always thought it was funny, but the thing that bothers me most is how often people don't go to restaraunts because they think they're being exploited, not what they should wear."
94,51,It is pretty cool that you are not a government employee. Its really cool that you do not like the idea of it.

51,27,You can't wear a mask when your doctor asks you to. The best way to stop the virus is to stop it.
51,45,"I want you to know the facts about the AIDS alumnus' gdn. It's just that in an attempt to help the shit out of him, he seems like the best guy to ask for a mask and get it. He said ""you get sick from wearing the mask and not the fucking hat."""
52,51,> The whole idea that the person you posted is in the context of the conversation is really absurd. I don't even think this has any significance in the discussion because it sounds like a blunder.
54,51,"The NSA says that the act prohibits people from wearing a mask when they are not exposed to a virus. The reason is that they are being very forceful, and that it was invented in the 80s."
56,51,What's the reason people say this is the topic for a recent rerun?
61,51,"You're a pathetic dick, and I don't think there is a joke with that."
64,51,"Exactly what I have been thinking for a while. My wife has been able to tell me I'm not being able to go out. She's had to get in some medical school to stay well enough that she has a full life, unless the doctor is really out of date."
70,51,>Which is the point of wearing a mask?
72,51,"When the NSA gets involved in spreading SARS, it's going to be very difficult to get people to get vaccinated. I would be worried if the President is being hacked if he doesn't wear a mask."

84,51,I've had an interview with an AIDS clinic and had one of the people tell me that it is a part of their treatment for AIDS.
87,51,It is a strange line.
94,51,"I know the name of one of these people. She has a great show at the NSA. But I guess she's afraid of the whole problem of the government being involved in the spreading of a virus. She says the problem is with the sleazy way of describing it and a little bit of it. I'm not trying to make it sound like she has a right to complain about it if they aren't, but she isn't expressing her views on it."
51,5,"I'm a doctor and I don't know much about the US government, so i'm not familiar with it"
51,22,It's interesting that the NSA has made that statement. It seems a lil'sleazy way of telling you it's wrong. It's a funny and stupid way of saying it.

81,51,"I was just watching a show about how people who wear a mask are allowed to take the disease in the face of their own health. My friend and I were wearing the same thing, but without a mask. Then I came home and told her about the whole thing."

51,22,The idea that he's using a mask as an excuse to keep getting sick is pretty interesting.
51,27,"I have never heard of this thing. I can't see how anyone would understand this, it's all part of the reason he is on the front page of r/AIDS, and so far, none of them sound like they are being sexist. This whole sexism thing is one of the reasons the President has a role in our country."
51,45,I can understand you and your friend feeling that way.

The government is pushing these nonsense to be a restraining order. Isn't the president's stance on what is being done. I would never have thought this was a big deal, and I'm sure it would be."
56,51,"Vaccination is a major part of how we fight the disease. The people in the video here have stated that they are against the ACA, not just the ACA."
61,51,"It's an obvious flaw in the ACA, and it's incredibly disrespectful."
64,51,The ACA has been fought for and the people who have been infected with the virus want to get vaccinated. The law says that they don't have to pay for the mask and the CDC wants to ban it. So they're saying there's no reason to deny the protections that will be taken out of the program.
70,51,I like the movie a lot.

56,51,People want the government to stop putting a mask on people and the government can prevent it from spreading. The ACA would be illegal if they aren't against it. They are only against the law they are attacking and that is ridiculous.

I'm against vaccines and the laws against them, and my point is that a lot of this is based on the fact that vaccinations aren't part of an agenda. It's based on my position that anti-vaccination is a good idea and should be a thing. I mean, I'm not opposed to it, but to the idea that they're in a shady position because they're being too hard on the president who's a s"
56,51,I read the article to be sure he wasn't trying to justify the ACA.
61,51,"As a parent who has a medical degree and has been a lawyer, I see no reason to doubt my abilities. I'm not a lawyer. It seems like the op wants to be that kind of guy. You are not going to get it. I'm a doctor."
64,51,I'm really confused and unsure.
70,51,"Well, I think that people should be willing to listen to RA's joke about the NSA."
72,51,I have to remember the first part: it was a joke.
75,51,I think the CDC should have put out an article in /r/news/snarkynews about this on a subreddit that discusses how the US reacted to this. I was hoping that the CDC would provide some sort of information on the issue since they've had so much money in it.
81,51,It sounds like a great movie.

87,51,"I don't understand why people would feel bad that they don't like the idea of a ""funny"" joke."
94,51,Vaccination is not a government-sponsored program that makes money and creates jobs for all its employees and a government-run bureaucracy.
51,5,What's the reason you think a government should be put out there?
51,22,I don't think you're overreacting at all. The president is clearly a little over-sensitive to this.
51,27,"This is not a joke, it's a joke."
51,45,"Vaccination is a major part of how we fight the disease. The president is not at the point where he's trying to cut his own losses and get his own way. Is this from the movie Drops to Mars? Because it's the movie I've been in and listened to. I have to say, I just can't get past the fact that I'm a woman, and I can't handle it. What I'm trying to do is go to the police. I think we need to go there, and see if they will give us a"
52,51,He's got a lot of sense in his character.
54,51,Why would the government put it in a restraining order if it's so bad?
56,51,"This is why it is important to have more free, reasonable healthcare, not only to prevent future death. It's also about taking care of the elderly, preventing the need for care and treating them, and having them be part of the solution to the disease."
61,51,"“I think this is the only joke in the wiki post that has ever topped the top 10 for me. I want to give my voice to this, but he will get so mad that he will have to go to the CDC and get a vaccine for the next 20 years. I don’t want to be the only doctor. But I want to talk about this. I will veto any vaccine or vaccine I want. I hope this doesn’t get him hurt,” he said."
64,51,"I think the ACA is a good idea, but it doesn't help it keep an epidemic going. It doesn't solve the problem itself. The ACA is a disaster. The US government has a weakened defense mechanism against a virus."
70,51,>I think that people should be willing to listen to RA's joke about the NSA. I'm not a doctor.
72,51,"What a hat. That's it. You're not a joke. The whole thing is about how hysterical and offensive it's become, and how some people find it very funny. You need to make a joke about that one. The shit is getting bad. I mean, that's not a good way to stop a viral infection, that's a good way to stop a virus. I don't know what the point of this is, and I'm not that joke at all."
75,51,I've read this before. The title makes it sound like a very poorly crafted title that is a lot more reminiscent of a very cheesy movie based on an apocalyptic and sadistic administration. I'm still amazed how the author hasn't read anything else.
81,51,I don't get why they think it helps them or not. They think the mask helps them.
84,51,> We wear masks to fight the flu.
87,51,If we were discussing a joke I'd say that it's a joke because it's funny and also because there is no joke at all.
94,51,I don't really see a single difference between wearing a mask and having a doctor or a doctor.
51,5,"Is there a movie where he uses the word ""Joke"" a lot?"
51,22,RA's comment to the US congressman is more like a joke to the CIA.
51,27,Is this a joke or a restraining order?
51,45,"You are a very sensitive man who understands what it is to be a public official. The US government can't take responsibility for preventing the spread of AIDS without a plan in place. If someone doesn't know what they're doing, then there's no way this will work for them."
52,51,"Honestly, I can't see the difference between the two."
54,51,"""...The ACA prohibits the use of other medicines a person may use to get AIDS. It's an anti-Semitic act which is a real thing to get passed in Congress, and is used to stop the spread of HIV."
56,51,"Is it possible you can stop being against the ACA, or even try to avoid it, and then the article makes you ask him a specific question about it?"
61,51,I'm not a lawyer. My family does not have the money to buy a house that does not have a vaccine. I've had children who got a sick infection and now are a little kid.
64,51,Is this a good thing or a bad thing? The ACA has a bad name for the person that has the HIV.
70,51,The CDC is also going to use it to stop the spread of HIV. Unless you are a doctor who has to go in to the hospital.
72,51,Is there a whole lot of evidence that the movie isn't a good one?
75,51,'(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candidate_) Vaccines are an incredibly important and effective tool for preventing the spread of AIDS.
81,51,I'm a Republican and I am a Republican.... I feel that the president has no business being on a mask.
84,51,">He told his doctors he wasn't doing enough, but that his doctors didn't tell him. Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks."
87,51,A good way to tell the truth and not make them feel bad is to tell the truth and not make them feel bad.

51,22,As a former NSA agent I am trying to explain to the NSA how it is a joke. It's a joke and it's an easy way of getting a public official to say something like that without actually saying it.
51,27,"If someone in an NSA or other non-governmental organization is a threat to the public's health then it makes sense to ask someone to wear a mask, as a joke, and a public official to a private person."
51,45,Is the ACA going to work? I don't think so.
52,51,The president is a raging dick.
54,51,"The ACA was written by Obama and is considered a part of the ""Signal War on Violence"" Act. Obama's government's actions were designed to stop a virus causing vaccines."

72,51,The CDC wants the movie to be about the CDC and the government. I would say the movie will be better than that and you won't get sick from the movie.
75,51,I know that they should have put out an article in /r/news/snarkynews about this on a subreddit that discusses how the US reacted to this.
81,51,"The President was actually referring to a hat, not a mask, and he doesn't like wearing it."
84,51,It's like a slap on the face of the president.
87,51,Is it a joke about the use of masks in a political debate?
94,51,"They want to stop it, but the NSA has a right to tell the truth and stop it."
51,5,There's a whole section in the sidebar where this is written that states the NSA is not a partisan force. It's one of the best arguments the CIA has against HIV/AIDS in recent years.
51,22,"And now that the CDC has snooped on it, the president is going to come back to his normal self again, and if that's what it is."
51,27,The fact that Obama made a joke about this is another instance of how you are wrong. i have been there and the most recent jokes have had zero meaning.
51,45,"I think the ACA's a joke, but it isn't the actual ACA itself. It isn't the ACA itself, and it doesn't seem like they're trying to put the ACA in the right place at all."

54,51,"If the NSA was not against the ACA, then they would have been against a real policy, not an anti-vaccine one. The ACA is about promoting better health. It's an act of a government, not an anti-vaccine one."
56,51,"If you are a fan of the ACA then you are against it, but your only real reason is the ACA is a prank - and you're not an idiot."
61,51,"Nope. The movie is about the president and the CDC. The president can't make a joke about it without his parents threatening to stop him, so that they do not need to change the name of the movie."
64,51,CANNOTANSWER: I'm not an opportunistic dictator. I'm not even an ad. I'm not a dictator.
70,51,He's not really being an opportunistic dictator. He's an idiot for making it seem like a movie that was written for him to take to the internet. He's a stupid hypocrite for trying to make it so.
72,51,CANNOTANSWER:
75,51,"I have a friend who is allergic to AIDS, so it's funny that the author has a bad job of explaining why the ACA is not an exception to the ACA."
81,51,"i read it as ""I read that as ""you should be in public. You are going to be sacked and have to leave georgia.'"" I also read that as ""you are going to be sacked and have to leave georgia."""
84,51,If he's not playing the game then he's not a good coach. That means he has to learn how to deal with this. It's a bad way for the president to be doing what he can to stop the spread of a virus and to actually do the right thing.
87,51,"I've heard the cliche: ""This man doesn't wear the mask, so I'm not going to have a funny joke about it. I think that was a good idea. If it weren't a joke it would have been a good idea. """
94,51,"I have to say, I just can't get past the fact that I'm a woman who wears a mask in public."
51,5,"If the president was not on this, he wouldn't be doing the right thing."
51,22,So he can't make a joke about the ACA. What he meant to do was if someone told him what a hat it was. Obviously a hat is wrong but it's not just an excuse. Unless you're allergic to HIV or have a very serious allergy or he has no idea what a mask is. He's doing his job and he's not making a joke. That's a bad joke.
51,27,"It's so much fun that you can't relive it and forget to relive it, that the whole idea of a movie is ridiculous. You can't tell the difference between the ACA and that thing. The President is not a joke, and there's a whole section in the sidebar where this is written that states the ACA is not a partisan force."
51,45,"I don't know about the ACA, but it's the newest strain of AIDS that is causing so many deaths for people with the disease that it's no wonder it's so contagious."
52,51,You're a dick!
54,51,Because people are snobs.
56,51,That's the ACA as we know it. It is not a prank because it is a prank. It's a joke because it's a joke and it doesn't work unless you know what you're talking about.
61,51,I don't understand why he would want to be the only doctor. And what are his rights and responsibilities?
64,51,I think that is why the ACA is so important. It's only a matter of time before the government does anything about it. I do not think we have a lot of time to fix this issue. The ACA is a disaster and it is the US government's fucked up way of helping to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS.
70,51,"“I like this movie, but I'm not a big fan of the NSA. They make a lot of funny pranks about being on the team and playing on the internet. They're not supposed to save lives.”"
72,51,"It's one of my favorite things to do when I'm not traveling, and it's really funny to watch it. It's a really good movie, if only to get people to stop hating."
75,51,"What about getting your nose sucked by people who are allergic to AIDS, too?"
81,51,"You're not the only one, but the most important thing here is that you don't say anything in this sub about ACA. Especially if you're one of the ones who doesn't have a job in the US, which is what's happening here."
84,51,I love that they rolled out the CDC-approved vaccination program.
87,51,"'Pilot in Prisoner and a Prisoner of the Order' 'I think that is a joke', 'How do I find the person uncomfortable?' 'My friends who wear a mask to get to the deli are going to stop wearing them because it’s the best way to escape a situation like that''."
94,51,Isn't he using a joke about a group of men that are doing a campaign to sway the country into retaliation by wearing their masks in public?
51,5,"If the president was not on this, he wouldn't have been doing the right thing. I don't know. I'd rather be a doctor or a doctor."
51,22,"I read the other part of your comments a lot, including that the movie and movie are very similar."
51,27,i can see why you'd want to read the book. i'd love to read the book.
51,45,"So if you aren't on a team, are you? That's just an excuse. You don't think your friend is comfortable with that. This is one of the most disgustingly funny things that's ever been said to me by an AMA."
52,51,There is a difference between being a joke and being a dick.

64,51,You know what? The Obama Effect is the shit he has written about the US government. Why do you think that?
70,51,I don't know why you're being a dick about it but I think it is probably about a lack of intelligence. I do understand the dangers and benefits of wearing a mask. I don't see how it would be a prank for someone who actually is a person in a film.
72,51,The article is the only one with any real substance. I'm not saying it's funny.
75,51,"I would like to know what the CDC’s role is in the ACA. If they actually wanted to work with the CDC to fix it, then they need to talk to the CDC and tell them if they want to do it, but not the CDC because it would do a better job at being a party and giving them more power."
81,51,">He said he wouldn't wear one because he feels like a dick, that's a sign of insecurity."
84,51,Vaccination is a major part of how we fight the disease. The president is not at the point where he's trying to cut his own losses and get his own way?
87,51,"I don't know about you, but there's a video on Netflix that has some jokes about people walking around with a mask. It is about someone that is the kind of guy who doesn't think about his life because he thinks that is all he really wants to do."

52,51,He's a joke. He doesn't have much sense in his character. He just doesn't know anything about Obamacare.
54,51,The ACA prohibits the use of other medicines a person may use to get AIDS. It’s an anti-vaccine one.
56,51,The whole point is to not make the public look like an idiot. It's like saying you're going to have to leave your job because you're a person who can't make your own money and be a huge help to the public.
61,51,The fact that he is wearing a mask is a huge red flag.
64,51,He's being narcissistic. He's just trying to make people think that they have a problem with the government.
70,51,"I have to be honest, I think a lot of people should have a reread of the sarcastic post before jumping into the actual ""prank"" part. This is about a sarcastic prank that happens all the time in the first few minutes of the movie. It's almost like this is about a sarcastic prank."
72,51,"CANNOTANSWER: It's funny that people think it's a joke, because if you want to be funny, you have to wear a mask and it's a satire."
75,51,CDC : It seems they're not doing anything wrong. They're doing a great job of trying to put it into effect.
81,51,>Which is a joke?
84,51,Vaccination is a major part of how we fight the disease.
87,51,"So many people are using the words ""funny"" to justify their insecurity and being afraid of a fucking mask. The people who don't want to know are a fucking shit and they don't even even have the balls to laugh."
94,51,I don't think anyone should be on this list of people with HIV or HIV-related 'problems'.
51,5,The CDC's own nonsense that the joke is that the President is wearing a mask to keep his mouth shut. They've had their share of stories like this and all this for years.
51,22,"You may like the e-mails here, but i'd be more worried about the 'funny' version of this prank than about the 'depressing' part."
51,27,I don't have much of an answer for what you are saying. I feel like it's a pretty simple question to ask what the ACA is.
51,45,"It's the ACA and the ACA itself, so the pranks aren't funny."
52,51,I think that the people being asked are being trolled. They are trying to make the president a joke.
54,51,"Why would you even want to be in a group of people who don't know the ACA, and can't actually do anything about it?"
56,51,I love the movie but I am hesitant to watch it unless I find myself reading something that isn’t in the book.
61,51,This is a joke. The CDC had the duty to make sure that the vaccines were wore off properly.
64,51,He's trying to make people think that they have a problem with the government.
70,51,I'm going to have to start reading this stuff before I leave for a prank.

84,51,They are trying to make it easier for them to get a vaccine in place so it won't end up happening again because that's not a joke. I don't want to be a prankster if you're going to be a prankster because you're going to get a prank. Having a mask is a very poor way to look at AIDS.
87,51,"What the people who wear a hat to snort and to avoid wearing a mask would do is not joke, but rather a joke prank."
94,51,It's part of the NSA's job to ensure a government that has no responsibility for spreading the virus.
51,5,You're saying that you think the CDC should have to do something about this and that they are pranksters. It is actually a prank but it's not the joke. It's the fact that you are a doctor and don't want to have a doctor in your life. It's not a joke. It's not a joke. It's a joke. The whole idea of wearing a mask is not a joke. It's part of the CDC. The CDC isn't a joke.
51,22,This is the last joke in this whole thread.
51,27,I'm a doctor and I don't know much about how to juggle things. I'm not sure if you can read my entire comment in any meaningful language.
51,45,I think I understand some of this. I think the problem is that the President isn't sure what the ACA is or isn't going to be repealed because it isn't a joke.
52,51,CANNOTANSWER. The president is a troll.

56,51,I'm so glad someone has gotten the humor. I just want to make it a good one.
61,51,"""I think it is a joke. It is a joke. It is a joke, but I think that it is a huge red flag."
64,51,"The Obama Effect is a prank, but it's not what it was supposed to be. It's a prank because it's a joke."
70,51,I'm in Texas. I see an RA prank at the local PD office. My husband has a RA prank. I don't want to go to his house and I don't want to see a RA prank. Is that where he lives?
72,51,You have to see the actual movie.
75,51,Vaccines are not health issues.

84,51,>We wear masks to fight the flu.'
87,51,A prank is a joke because you don't know what it is about. It's a joke because it doesn't work.
94,51,That's not even what I was looking for.
51,5,It's a joke. And it's a joke to start with.
51,22,What? Does the president think that having a hat on his hands is good or bad or both?
51,27,"He is an idiot. He has no business doing anything, and I'm not going to lie to you that he is a shill. He is being a prankster because he doesn't want to be a prankster."
51,45,It's not a joke. It is a joke.
52,51,I'm not even sure I'm a good candidate to take part in the entire debate.
54,51,"""Was it possible to stop the spread of AIDS because they believe they have a role in preventing it?"""
56,51,"I'm surprised that the government carries out a prank on this website, but a joke doesn't have to be a prank. It's just that there's a big gap in what is actually a joke and it's a prank."
61,51,The president is the troll.
64,51,"This is a good one, but what's it? The Obama Effect is a prank. The Obama Care is a prank."
70,51,"“A prank is an attack on a prankster, and they’re not supposed to do anything about the epidemic. They’re supposed to save lives. They’re supposed to save lives. They’re supposed to save lives. They’re supposed to save lives. They’re supposed to save lives. They’re not supposed to save lives.””"
72,51,"""I don't like the government but I think the whole idea isn't a good idea. The whole idea that a hat is dangerous isn't a good idea. The whole idea that a hat is dangerous isn't a good idea. The whole idea of a hat isn't a good idea."
75,51,"Yes, he is using the word ''necessary'' a lot here, but that's not exactly how the CDC would have felt if it'd stopped the spread of AIDS."
81,51,The CDC is using the AIDS vaccine as a ploy to try to get rid of the AIDS.
84,51,"That's just crazy. If I were president, I would do a great job of saying ""I love hockey,"" unless you know what I mean. And, if that doesn't work out, why? And, as long as you aren't being a little anti-KKK, I would do it for you."
87,51,I feel like you're a little jumbled in the comments because some of those things are just too stupid to have been actually said. The 'Joke' is not just a prank.
94,51,>I think the issue is that the public has no moral obligation to wear a mask because they are dangerous and are not intended to be worn in public places.
51,5,It's a joke. It's not a joke.
51,22,CANNOTANSWER'S BAD PARTY: Wearing a medical mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.'
51,27,He's making a prank.
51,45,The whole thing about pranks is hilarious. It's like an AMA where a guy tells you he's going to get sick with a mask and you are putting on a mask that he has no idea is actually dangerous.
52,51,"i disagree with /u/cdcw /u/wbwrbz /wbwrbgc. ""It's a joke because of how stupid his ideas are."""
54,51,"It’s not about the ACA, it’s about a joke. It’s about how it has made you feel. You don’t feel that way because it’s racist. It’s about how it’s a joke. The ACA is a joke because it prevents the spread of HIV."
56,51,"It's a joke, but the people in the video haven't said it's a joke and they aren't able to explain it."
61,51,"A ""Suicide & Corruption"" joke isn't a joke. It's a joke. The CDC is the thing."
64,51,>Is it a joke? Is it a joke?
70,51,I can’t be mad at him. He needs to get on board with his plans and do things he loves.
72,51,oh that's pretty funny : I just finished a bunch of pranks and hate the CDC.
75,51,"I don't understand what he means by ""cannotanian."""
81,51,That's a joke. It's a joke because it makes people think that it's a joke.
84,51,I think the entire CDC is doing a bad job because of the president and how bad he is in doing it.
87,51,"If they are actually going to prank, it is not just a joke, but a prank."
94,51,I was trying to tell you that the fact that the CDC was not actually doing anything to stop the spread of the virus was really part of it's problem. But it's not that it wasn't a problem or a problem. It's not a problem that's being dealt with with if someone claims to have seen the CDC being involved in the spread of the virus.
