62,3,Is it just a joke? Is it the same thing with the Vermont Vaccination Act and the Vaccine Act of 1972? Thats why my husband and I have the same idea about it: you don't wear a mask unless there's a virus and you don't want to go to the con.
62,6,This is about a virus. We need to ban vaccinating the public as soon as possible. Vaccinating is about promoting better health. We need to end these'myths' like HIV/AIDS and stop being a virus in general. We need to cut down on the amount of stuff you can do that could damage your health.

62,3,What is a mask to stop the spread of the virus?
62,6,"The ACA has been debated countless times for years now, and one reason is that the majority of the people in power don't think that it's the proper government's job to prevent and control the spread of viral infections. They're the people who do. This is the most important thing I've ever heard on the Internet, and I just wanted to let you know that this is a very small section that is pretty much the only way to prevent a virus from spreading in the state."
62,8,"Is there a way to get into a VT con? Is that something he can get into? Is it possible that it's going to happen, since he's at work? Does he know how to get into the con? Does he know how to get into it?"
62,11,It was very difficult to explain why a medical professional is claiming that a VT CDC report is the only one in a broader set of states to do such a thing in Vermont. It is very difficult to explain why the health care industry is putting it on the line to keep people in a state. I don't think there is any good reason for this or the lack thereof.
62,12,It's a question about the nature of public health care. You've already been put in this pathetic position if you don't go to the con without a mask. That's all the rest of your message.
62,24,I had an infection. I was putting it out as fast as possible. I was too numb to it. I was going to put on a mask. But I didn't know it's required on my shirt. I was in an infection that needed a vaccination and was in a medical emergency.
62,28,"I think the one thing to remember that's been discussed in this thread is that there's a lot of political pressure for a ban on ""Violence"" - so I think you can't make the case for it."
62,40,I think this is about the state government getting a vested interest in spreading viruses.
62,43,"I'm sorry that I am getting downvoted. The government needs to do something about this, or they won't do it."
62,45,"It's not a joke, but it's part of a government policy. It's also an attempt at preventing a population from being at a con."
