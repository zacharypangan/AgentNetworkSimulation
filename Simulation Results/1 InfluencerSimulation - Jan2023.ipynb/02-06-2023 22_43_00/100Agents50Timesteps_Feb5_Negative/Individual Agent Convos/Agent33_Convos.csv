96,33,if you wear a mask outside or in your car alone your gullible and submissive not traits you want to project
33,11,This is true. The first time I went to a doctor in georgia I would go in to see the doctor and I would have to wear a mask for it.
33,21,Why is this not a trump issue?
33,23,"I do this all the time. I wear my mask a lot, it is the most ridiculous thing I can think of. It is so uncomfortable and it can get very dirty after the fact."
33,28,Is the virus in the US? Yes.
34,33,"See how crazy trump's making America is here. I know this is a troll post, but I think it's hilarious because you are one of the few people that actually actually wear a mask. The fact that you do this is quite touching for me. It's one of those times when you just have to think how ridiculous you are."
41,33,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
52,33,I think it's very sad that someone has no way of telling if their 'face' or their face are not being taken off and that someone who wears a mask knowingly infringes on their health.
58,33,"Well, there is a lot more to it."
63,33,Putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i ve done in my entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i ve done in my entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask to walk 
69,33,I was wondering why a person would wear a mask outside and at the end of a fight to protect themselves.
74,33,"If they wear a mask they are gonna lose the infection and if they do, they will be extinct."
75,33,I will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask
77,33,I see what you did there....
78,33,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
87,33,I used to wear a mask to get through restaurants and then I couldn't get around it without it. I've been there and had it on for over a year. It was one of the nicest experiences I have ever had.
91,33,So what did he vote for?
93,33,"This is exactly the reason the government tries to force people to wear a mask, and then tries to force them into wearing a jab for a reason."
96,33,Wearing a mask outside or in your car alone is a part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus
33,11,You are a troll. I can't think of a more appropriate name. I'm the guy in that picture. I don't think people could find any other meaning to 'why' a mask? 'They think people should be wearing a mask''.
33,21,"I'm not saying it is an issue, but I do wear a mask pretty much daily. So I guess it's kind of ridiculous to be honest, but I think the issue here is that we've already been on a ""the government"" path for the past 20 years, i.e. we've done a lot of stuff like putting on a mask, wearing a hat or anything else, but it's also pretty ridiculous for a person to think the government is doing nothing wrong in helping stop a virus, and that we should all make decisions that require"
33,23,"It seems that you're trying to bring a more important issue of 'trump' af to your attention. I'm in the states, so I'm curious how you got that idea."
33,28,"I don't think the first time I went to a doctor in Georgia, I would wear a mask for it. It is ridiculous and uncomfortable. I wear it all the time. I'd wear it for it. It is so uncomfortable and it can get very dirty after the fact. Is the virus in the US? Yes. See how crazy trump's making America is here."
34,33,Because the president is not going to change his behavior by allowing the people to speak about their lives. There's no way that a virologist will actually know what a virologist is.
41,33,"As a Georgian who has never been vaccinated, I could go on my tour and see the entire state in the picture."
52,33,"I think the best thing we can do here is keep the masks off and let the parents go, and then get their kids to learn about the dangers of the vaccine."
58,33,Are the coaches being treated the same as all coaches? Or are coaches treated the same as all other coaches in a situation like this?
63,33,It's been a long time since I've done a syringe of a syringe that I've used to protect myself - I only wear a syringe for the purpose of protecting myself.
69,33,Is wearing a mask part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
74,33,"I was born with a mask, but I haven't worn one since I was about 7 months old."
75,33,A lot of people on this website are making it so that you can't claim that you have to wear a mask.
77,33,"Aside from having to wear a mask in public, people have had to have their hands and legs covered in a mask to prevent the spread of a virus."
78,33,"What does a helmet really do? I can't remember which one, but it seems like they just wanted to prevent the virus from spreading. It's a helmet and doesn't work, so it's a good idea to have it on unless the school has the mandate, and if the school had the mandate, they could just take them off."
87,33,"That joke is actually quite a great one. I’ve read the original and gotten the sense that there is no ""god"" for the world. I’ve only learned this one once, and it’s quite the shit for people to get that a lot."
91,33,he is the first elected President
93,33,The government doesn't want to stop HIV/AIDS because the ACA is intended to prevent it.
96,33,That is true but the way you write it doesn't apply to every single person in a public space.
33,11,"Well I guess the problem is the government in my town is a bunch of little kids. And I've learned a lot since I was around 7, but my parents are far from very religious and they are pretty far from religious. So I'm not saying it's the problem. But I think the idea is a little silly and stupid. So I think it's interesting to hear the people talking and remarking."
33,21,"You're telling me the truth, but in my defense, if you put on a mask or a hat every day, that you wear it all the time. It's very uncomfortable and you don't wear a mask every day."
33,23,The ACA is in effect. It's also intended to protect against some form of HIV/AIDS.
33,28,The idea that the President is not going to change his behavior by allowing the people to speak about their lives is kind of creepy.
34,33,I don't think this is a very good description of the article. It's basically saying that the President didn't wear a mask to prevent the spread of the virus. It's an extremely poor way to describe the president and the health state of his presidency.
41,33,"The OP is a man, not a woman."
52,33,CANNOTANSWER: I love coaching however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops i love coaching
58,33,"I'm the same way, I don't think it's funny that you're being a very stupid person... Besides the fact that you're having trouble in the system, I think you're very stupid."
63,33,I had a friend who did this as well. He's not actually a big fan of the idea of wearing a syringe.
69,33,"Y'know, I could wear a mask in public in order to protect myself. They do it for political reasons."
74,33,"I know you're sick and a little crazy but if you're sick, you'll probably need to consult your health care professional. The government has to put a barrier on their throats so that anyone who is bitten by a virus can be screened for it and the hives from it aren't exposed."
75,33,[(Making it illegal to wear a mask)
77,33,I just went back and rewatched the original article and the whole thing just sounded like a piece of shit. I thought it was very clever. Is that how the virus spread?
78,33,"A little funny, but I think you're right that this is a really good joke. It's just something the administration would be too busy with putting the other party's name in."
87,33,"I'm sorry but I have to say, I think wearing a mask can actually help people."
91,33,This is how crazy trumps made the united states of america
93,33,"People are raped by this kind of shit, people who want a hug should not be forced to wear masks."
96,33,"There are people who don't know what a mask looks like in a game, they just want a head sleeve or something."
33,11,"Y'know, I could wear a mask in public in order to protect myself. They do it for political reasons. I know you're sick and a little crazy but if you're sick, you'll probably need to consult your health care professional. The government has to put a barrier on their throats so that anyone who is bitten by a virus can be screened for it and the hives from it aren't exposed. The government has to put a barrier on their throats so that anyone who is bitten by a virus can be screened for"
33,21,"I don't care about the fact that it's creepy, but I think it's an interesting point of view to have. I would be very happy to see the president in the United States and be able to see the world through a hat, and wear a mask everyday."
33,23,I think this is the problem here because it is so common in people in many parts of the country.
33,28,It sounds like the ACA is going to be implemented by 2039. The government can change it but will not. I hope your friend can see his own doctor.
34,33,">But people can be raped and killed by the government, and if someone else has no say it's a cliche that they're doing it they're trying to justify the raped, but what they want is to get them into the public eye to get the vaccine that they need."
41,33,The ACA is mandated by law.
52,33,"CANNOTANSWER: if they don't wear a mask or wear a helmet properly, they have to be fired - because the doctor wants the state to teach his players and don't give him the choice between wearing a mask or wearing a helmet - and have their parents go and tell their kids the dangers of the vaccine."
58,33,"There are many ways that masks are effective, you just don't have the sense of the word."
63,33,"There is a very clear line between wearing a mask and going to a doctor. It may seem like a stupid idea, but that's the point."
69,33,This is so old news. And there are not many that will actually listen to it.
74,33,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. OP:
75,33,"As someone who lives in Connecticut, I can tell you that the government is being a bit of a jerk, they may not want to work hard to prevent the spread of a virus. They may also want to take steps to prevent the spread of HIV, if they are really really trying to stop the spread of the virus."
77,33,"This is very very true. It's important that people are aware of and aware of the consequences of not being vaccinated. A lot of people, especially teenagers, are not aware that being vaccinated to get a virus is necessary for the health of the population."
78,33,CDC - What’s the reason you have to wear a mask for a virus to kill you?
87,33,"I'm afraid the other side is very wrong. You don't know a person who is a bit sick in a way. If you look at your mask, you see a cliche of the person on it thinking, ""If you wear a mask, you're not a bad person."" So, as you said, the person who says ""I don't like wearing a mask, but I think wearing a mask can actually help people."""
91,33,They did not vote for it. That's really all they had to do.
93,33,"It seems the ACA is squeezing the country into a very dangerous place where people are being forced to take advantage of a policy that was passed years ago. It's not a simple fact that there is one big issue with it, it's really just a huge piece of legislation."
96,33,My brother does this to the kids.
33,11,CANNOTANSWER:
33,21,"I don't even know what it means to be a political politician, but I do know this:"
33,23,"A lot of people, especially teenagers, are not aware that being vaccinated is necessary for the health of the population."
33,28,"This is the truth. But in other parts of the country, it's actually pretty dangerous."
34,33,"I agree. I would not be surprised if more people tried this. Its a very sad shambles, but I can’t get behind that. I’d definitely wear a mask on someone who has had a virus in their system. Its hard to see how someone can get away with a virus without a mask."
41,33,"> We gotta go to the hospital to get tested for a virus. We need to see a doctor that's familiar with the virus, but we don't know when. I want to see how it passes though if my doctors tell me how to take it on a drug test."
52,33,"That's a really really stupid way to make things happen. I just want to say, I love coaching... I love coaching... but I am the first to tell my govt to stop wearing a mask, just like their government."
58,33,I think it's really silly to say this is a non-Standard thing. You can't help but get vaccinated.
63,33,"I don't like the idea of wearing a syringe when it's a big deal. But if I were in the NBA, I would be wearing my helmet."
69,33,There is a whole subreddit dedicated to this subject and it's about the idea that wearing a mask in public is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
74,33,"I can't imagine that a bunch of sarcastic, stupid jokes on r/Racists are out there!"
75,33,"CANNOTANSWER : The CDC are trying to make that shit illegal by making them illegal, which is misleading because they are promoting falsehoods that will help stop the spread of a virus."
77,33,CANNOTANSWER: [King's gonna be the one that reads that post
78,33,"This is one of the most blatantly stupid things I've ever heard. I had to leave college just so I could not read the text, so I just started reading the article."
87,33,he's a writer
91,33,"I don't know how you feel. I voted against the order, but I wanted to say that if he wore it, he should get a new mask."
93,33,This is very interesting. I would like to say that the president is a tyrant who wants to get rid of any form of health care.
96,33,"It is a thing. Every person who doesn't wear a mask does this. Everyone in the country should do so because of the rule that it is a violation of health care, that is to say, the whole government is the government. But you cannot make it wrong if the government says that ""This is about a mask that carries a virus"""
33,11,I hate to be that guy.
33,21,It's almost like the government was trying to stop the spread of HIV.
33,23,The ACA is in effect. It's also intended to protect against some form of HIV/AIDS.
33,28,People are being forced to take advantage of a policy that was passed years ago.
34,33,It is hard to see how someone can get away with a virus without a mask.
41,33,"i'm not the most professional doctor, but i understand you have more serious issues than that."
52,33,The problem with the ACA is that it's not illegal for people to wear masks and that it's actually illegal for doctors to wear masks.
58,33,"The article suggests that the US government is doing everything for national security. It's not ""helping"" with the spread of the virus."
63,33,"I'm also sorry that I'm getting downvoted. The government needs to do something about this, or they won't."
69,33,"AIDS research group. Is he being a dick? He has a history of a fever, but he doesn't have a chronic illness, he has some form of HIV infection."
74,33,"They said ""Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
75,33,This is a great example of I hate to sound snarky but this movie is an excellent read.
77,33,"""What the fuck is a mask?"""
78,33,You got the joke. The President made it public that the ACA is affecting more people. I'm sure he has a point.
87,33,A good way to tell the joke is to tell the truth and not make them feel bad.
91,33,Trump is wearing a mask to help prevent the spread of a virus.
93,33,"If the health care system is failing, people are going to have to go through another crisis or they are going to go through a depressed period."
96,33,CANNOTANSWER: I love coaching however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops. I feel like a lot of people are just going to be like you.
33,11,"The people talking are being disrespectful, and I hate to say that the president has made a point."
33,21,"My fucking best friend got his mask from me and he would make me wear it a lot and it would cause a lot of discomfort. He had to go, and I was at his house in Florida. I was shocked at how he felt. But it was still weird to see him wear it and think it is uncomfortable."

But you cannot make it wrong if the government says that ""This is about a mask that carries a virus"" I hate to sound snarky but this movie is an excellent read."
33,28,"The thing about a mask is it isn't necessary to prevent the spread of a virus. The government isn't even allowed to impose it, it's just a tool to help prevent it."
34,33,">I felt like some people would just want to make this clear. I was just a student. I wasn't a troll, but I had a hard time believing that a mask was just not in the uniform that the president needed to wear. I am just being silly."","
41,33,"When he's not at work, I'll let him go."
52,33,The article has some serious questions about the ACA.
58,33,">The article suggests that the US government is doing everything for national security. It's not ""helping"" with the spread of the virus."
63,33,"If you're gonna go get vaccinated, you're likely to get a rat in your mouth. That's not cool, but the answer is likely not that smart if you don't wear a mask every time someone else wants to get vaccinated."
69,33,"I have been told by a bunch of people that I've seen how to use it, and I've always been pretty open with them on it, but I don't have to agree."
74,33,"I was a little kid at the time, and that wasn't an issue."
75,33,"I'm not a conspiracy theorist, but I do think that the government should be able to act in an orderly fashion, in order to prevent the spread of disease. I don't think it is fair to say that the CDC is a good example of government retribution."
77,33,The article makes a pretty obvious statement. It states that this is a symptom of a public health problem.
78,33,A great example of this kind of joke. There's no excuse for it.
87,33,That is an awesome point of discussion!
91,33,"The president is wearing a mask to help prevent the spread of the virus. I don't get how your post is wrong, but you should definitely read the article."
93,33,The President is an opportunistic dictator. You are making the wrong assumption. It doesn't make you a tyrant. The president is not a tyrant. He wants to change the health care system.
96,33,"CANNOTANSWER, CANNOTANSWER'S INJURY, WAS OVER THE ASSESSMENT OF A CHILD. I've read this story before and it's actually pretty clear how much of an awful subject this is."
33,11,"If a friend of mine did this to himself, I was frightened."
33,21,So the President is wearing a mask to protect our children from a deadly virus?
33,23,The US is a bit opportunistic. The President is a tyrant who wants to change the health care system.
33,28,I think if he had a mask it would have prevented the spread of the virus. The president should have had it.
34,33,"I'm not a troll, but I'm going to try my hardest to get in the context of the post."
41,33,It's funny because I'm not sure what you mean by 'The ACA'

58,33,"I think the article is a little misleading, considering that some commenters will say something along the lines of:"
63,33,I think it's a good idea to just wear the mask and not the syringe.
69,33,>The CDC isn't working on vaccines. The CDC is. The only thing that matters to the CDC is that it doesn't work.
74,33,It is not a joke. The government doesn't control the way people think. It is a problem.
75,33,I would be really angry at the government for not implementing the ACA.
77,33,So the entire president has to wear a mask to protect himself. What is the difference between a mask and being able to go to work?
78,33,This makes me want to go to a hospital in Connecticut. This is the worst part of being an alcoholic.
87,33,"It is just a joke, because it ties into something more."
91,33,"It is called ""Secure Diseases. They are a part of their policy of not being able to fend for themselves""."
93,33,The president is an opportunistic dictator. You are making the wrong assumption. It doesn't make you a tyrant. He wants to change the health care system.
96,33,I'm sorry but this is what I would think of when a prank like this happens.

33,23,I have no idea why you're having issues with this.

34,33,">A lot of people are trolls, and people are just not in the mood for a sarcastic stance. It's not so much the CDC as the CDC and the entire community is trying to. It's a misunderstanding. A lot of people are trolls, and people are just not in the mood for a sarcastic stance."
41,33,The ACA is mandated by law. They don't address the problem.
52,33,"And the president is very aware that a mask is not a legitimate health care choice, but a moral one. He wants to protect people from AIDS. He doesn't want to help, he wants to help people protect themselves."

77,33,There isn't much that a lot of people don't realize about this unless they read it before making the move.
78,33,They're using the ACA to try and stop the spread of HIV to people who have not had treatment. You could get vaccinated if the schools could.
87,33,"People who don't know what their rights are aren't able to see and accept any kind of protection against that kind of protection, nor does a woman, in addition to the fact that her bare hands can't see anything because she wants to eat or drink / smoke in public, aren't good for her. I've always thought it was funny, but the thing that bothers me most is how often people don't go to restaraunts because they think they're being exploited, not what they should wear."

74,33,I read about this in an interview on a real life show at a 'hollywood studio'. The guy was literally like the guy in that movie. I think he just doesn't know what a joke is and isn't quite sure what a joke is.

77,33,People wearing a mask is the biggest problem facing America.
78,33,This is such a weird thing to say. It's like saying people who don't understand how a hammer is being blazing all over their head is a dick joke. It's a funny thing.
87,33,"I think the idea of wearing a mask in public is ridiculous. And as a woman, I can say, I've read a few different people wearing masks, but most of them have gotten their own masks."
91,33,"YOu can see a movie called ""The President is wearing a mask to help prevent the spread of the virus."
93,33,"I think the article states that he is against these mandates because they're ""too opportunistic to pass anything without the consent of a doctor."""
96,33,">This is a big deal. The only thing I see about the ""masked"" thing is that the masked man is actually a coach."
33,11,"It doesn't sound like he's trying to change the health care system. The idea is silly, if he didn't think it'd be fair."
33,21,"It's an interesting view to have. I would be very happy to see the president in the United States and be able to see the world through a hat, and wear a mask everyday. I'm so sorry this is what is happening to him."
33,23,"I think it's worth trying out, it's so much fun, but I do understand that the other guy is a tyrant."
33,28,"I had a friend who did a face mask show in the first few months of this year, and he thought it was cool to do it."
34,33,You're trying to portray someone as a devious person that does not understand why people have to wear a mask? It doesn't look like they do.
41,33,"""This is a joke. The idea of wearing a mask is sexist and inappropriate. The NSA are using the AIDS virus as an excuse to use it. They are making a film about it so they can avoid it."
52,33,"Are we all getting the vaccine? If so, then why the fuck would we need to keep the masks off? Why are we trying to stop it?"
58,33,It seems that it's really not a joke that is getting rid of the virus. It's about the ACA.
63,33,Putting on a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
69,33,"And here's a gif of a guy with a hat, playing basketball and working his way to the rhd."
74,33,"He's a joke, he's not a joke."
75,33,I do not think that the government is a good example of government retribution.
77,33,>Is wearing a mask an example of a lack of proper protection? Because that's a big fucking no. The most important thing that the article says is that wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.Are you a fan of the President's apocryphal apocryphal propaganda?
78,33,Is it a prank? Is it a joke? That was so prank worthy I could have laughed at it when I read it in the article.
87,33,"I feel a bit bad for the person wearing that one, but I'm not sure it is a joke."
91,33,I haven't seen it.
93,33,"Trying to give the impression that the ACA is in the hands of ""thugs"" is a bad idea."
96,33,"CANNOTANSWER, CANNOTANSWER'S INJURY WAS OVER THE ASSESSMENT OF A CHILD. I've read this story before and it's actually pretty clear how much of an awful subject this is. I'm not surprised people are doing this in the US:"
33,11,"""... and the first time I went to a doctor in georgia I would go in to see the doctor and I would have to wear a mask for it."""
33,21,So he's wearing a mask everyday?
33,23,"The first one I read about this was the one about the guy in the hat who is a coach, not a person wearing a mask who is a president, a tyrant, who wanted to change the healthcare system."
33,28,"The fact that he is wearing a mask is a part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I think the article states that he is against these mandates because they're ""too opportunistic to pass anything without the consent of a doctor."""
34,33,A lot of people aren't trolls.
41,33,"I see you mean ""no excuse to wear a mask."""
52,33,We need to protect children and teachers.
58,33,"""We should all know that the ACA is a joke and that we need to work together. The NSA is an integral part of the public health system, it's only used to prevent an illness from being spread to the entire country."
63,33,"I am not a member of the US government, but I don't believe the NSA tries to make a point of what it's about. You aren't the only person on Reddit."
69,33,So the CDC is trying to stop HIV?
74,33,In general people who don't know what a joke is and don't know what a joke is are cynical idiots.
75,33,"So what does it say, ""The CDC are trying to make that shit illegal, which is misleading because they are promoting falsehoods that will help stop the spread of a virus."
77,33,What is a mask and what does it say about it?
78,33,You're going to be a joke. It's the only good thing he has done.
87,33,"In the United States, ""wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.The idea of wearing a mask to help people who have problems is pretty funny. It sounds like you need to get your hands out, and then the people who use it will get the most out of your life. I’ve only learned this one once, and it’s quite the shit for people to get that a lot. I’ve only learned this one once, and it’s quite the shit for people"
91,33,"I think the joke is that ""we don't want an outbreak"" -- ""if they were forced to make it, it would be a pretty stupid decision to make it."""
93,33,"""The President is an opportunistic dictator. You are making the wrong assumption. It doesn't make you a tyrant. He wants to change the health care system."""
96,33,"The article is titled ""The President of the United States of America"" and is a major part of the spooky shit that is causing the death of a child."
33,11,"I have an opinion. I do not understand what your point is. I don't see the problem here, but what I do understand from your piece is that it's a big red flag. People talk about the problem, people have problems. The president is a tyrant. They're going to put the government in jail for something, and it will be a lot harder to enforce. It's too hard to change the state, and I do not see where you can justify having the government be a tyrant for a few months and years"
33,21,"CANNOTANSWER and I are trying to tell the guy that the NSA is in the hands of thugs, that we shouldn't have it in our hat."
33,23,"It's the kind of thing that makes a lot of people in my area, and even the CDC."
33,28,"A lot of people aren't trolls. I see you mean ""no excuse to wear a mask."""
34,33,"I read this as ""I want to wear a mask on a girl and I want to wear it on her."", ""I hate that guy too, I don't care if he's a troll or not, but he doesn't seem to like people, and I love to have fun and play football."""
41,33,The idea of wearing a mask to prevent the spread of AIDS is not an acceptable use of the federal ACA. Vaccination mandates aren't required by law in the USA.
52,33,> Do we all get the vaccine?
58,33,I feel that we must stop using the ACA to stop the spread of this terrible virus.
63,33,"The story is based on the prank in the movie. I want to know why the NSA doesn't believe it's not that ridiculous a point, but you're correct."
69,33,"I've gotten to know this guy a lot, and I think that is kind of an inflammatory joke. But, he doesn't seem to know how to actually speak up, so he doesn't seem to know how to talk about HIV."
74,33,"The whole thing is funny, but not the joke."
75,33,You guys need to stop using the word 'hoarding'. It means the CDC is telling you what is going on.
77,33,This is the worst apocryphal thing to happen to America.
78,33,"The fact that he voted against the mask on national stage, as well as a naivete on a joke makes me think he's being the guy who was going to be the guy who says the whole ACA is a joke is all he's doing. It's the one that makes the whole Obama administration feel stupid."
87,33,A good way to tell the truth and not make them feel bad is to tell the truth and not make them feel bad.
91,33,"Despite the fact that Trump is a bigot, he would never want to be President. It is an extremely hysterical way of saying something, not to mention blatantly anti-semitic, but a stupid one at that."
93,33,There are people in this subreddit who disagree with you.
96,33,I'm a little surprised because this is what happens when a prank like this happens.
33,11,I know what you mean. The NSA is in the hands of thugs and it is a joke.
33,21,Those are the words you're using.
33,23,This prank is very dangerous for the health of your child.
33,28,I can't even begin to tell the difference between this article and the actual story.
34,33,"As a Jewish person who is in the medical field, I've read this, and this is a really good read."
41,33,Vaccine mandates aren't required by law in the USA. The NSA is using the AIDS virus as an excuse to use it. They are making a film about it so they can avoid it. The problem with a mask is the people wearing it don't actually know how to walk because they think it's bad. This is what smirks me the most.
52,33,"The article you responded to is about the ACA. If I were a politician, I would have voted for Obama on health care because it was a joke. You're a lawyer? I was just being facetious when I read this."
58,33,[The best way to stop the spread of the virus. Please wear masks.
63,33,I agree. The NSA isn't a fool. There is a very clear line that between putting on a mask and going to a doctor isn't as logical as it sounds.
69,33,"That is a really good way to look at things. The CDC isn't working on HIV, but it is a very good way to look at HIV, and the CDC should be working on it. CDC, if they don't, would be working on the ACA and CDC."
74,33,OP: I'm sorry but I didn't know it was a movie.
75,33,"CDC: ""If you want to get sick from something, you have to get vaccinated. We are going to have to have a mask."""
77,33,"Yes, a lot of the neo-nazis who are outraged at ACAs are. They don't want to be the snobbery and hateful clowns that are threatening the lives of the people who want them to bleed and die."
78,33,"I'm not saying this was a prank or anything, just something that happened in a few places in the state."
87,33,"In a few paragraphs you've read, the joke is ""Funny jokes aren't a joke."""
91,33,">It's an extremely hysterical way of saying something, not to mention blatantly anti-semitic, but a stupid one at that."
93,33,"I think Obama is the right president. He hasn't done anything to make it all work. And while he is a tyrant, I think the way he acts is quite an interesting one."
96,33,"The article says the President is a troll and is an attempt to create a vacuum. And, it's also an attempt to justify using the word ""to protect the children"" in the article as a reference to the president, which isn't exactly a good one."
33,11,CANNOTANSWER isn't the only one who thinks the ACA is a joke.
33,21,What does a prank like this mean?
33,23,"Yes, a lot of the people who are outraged at the ACA have the ability to get sick from HIV/AIDS, but the people who do not know how to walk are not able to take care of it. There's also this ridiculous, and very naive way to tell what people think of the ACA."
33,28,"A lot of people who are trolls don't realize how much they are committing to the government, even if they don't feel like they're able to."
34,33,I read it in the context of a satire in a satire.
41,33,Isn't he actually a president?
52,33,There aren't any facts that can be judged on what the actual facts and the facts are and I can't see what they are. There are no statistics to the contrary. It's not like there are some racial slurs in here.
58,33,"It sounds like you're a huge fan of the book, ""The Secret to the Conan O'Brien."""
63,33,The NSA has absolutely no right to ban the use of a syringe. The NSA isn't a government entity. It isn't a right to ban it.
69,33,"CANNOTANSWER: ""I feel like my sarcasm will not re-appear in this thread because the president is trying to save us from becoming a parasite."""
74,33,>I thought it was a movie.
75,33,"It seems like he's just getting started. This is how he said, ""At least we're not saying he's right, but the CDC's inaction is not in the best interest of us."""
77,33,"CANNOTANSWER: ""I am not a conspiracy theorist, but I do not believe the presidents'masks are actually good, but it's not really what people want unless the president is just being a snide troll. The fact that he's trying to prank people that aren't infected is also a factor. I think the presidents'masks are actually good, but it's not really what people want unless the president is just being a snide troll."
78,33,I think this is a great joke about the ACA.
87,33,"[It's a joke, but it's not a joke. ](http://www.nolo.org/media/advice/rpg/) has a nice one in there (e.g. the one about the shit guy in the movie) it's a funny, funny, and well received joke."
91,33,"It is an interesting thing to say. It's the same way they say something, but I don't really think the person who voted against it should do anything about it, it seems as if he's talking about a way to stop the spread of the virus."
93,33,I don't think the government is trying to make people think they have a problem with the government. It's trying to make people think they have a problem with the government.
96,33,"This story isn't a prank, this is an abuse of power."
33,11,>Were we supposed to have a mask for the syringe to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS?
33,21,It seems like there are too many sexist and racist posts in this thread.
33,23,"They are pranks. The ACA is a joke, but it isn't really what a troll like him is trying to bring attention to. CANNOTANSWER'S NOT a conspiracy theorist, but he is an interesting person who thinks it's a prank, but it's an abuse of power."
33,28,"I can only assume it's the joke that's referencing this ad. I think the article isn't a satire, but it's an attempt at a better way to tell the truth."
34,33,"I'm the guy that wrote the movie ""The Matrix."""
41,33,"They are the biggest thing to happen if the people in the CIA aren't properly vaccinated. If the ACA isn't in place, why isn't it implemented in the first place?"
52,33,The president is doing the best he can.
58,33,"So what did we say about ""The best way to stop the spread of the virus. Please wear masks.""?"
63,33,"I was the guy who went to the medical school and had a CDC cloned and removed the syringe. I was unable to get the syringe removed. The CDC had no evidence of that, and I was pretty sure they used the wrong syringe."
69,33,"A lot of Americans don't really understand what a mask is, especially after the first year of college, a CDC employee. That's not like people wearing a mask, especially after the first year of college, a CDC employee. That's not like people wearing masks to protect themselves, and when they're done, it's no big deal. So you can't rely on a snob like you do? So, in a way, the ""sad"" part is insinuating """
74,33,I think this is pretty satirical to start with.
75,33,The US has been a terrible example of retribution.
77,33,"I know he is a prankster, but this is more about the presidents snooping. It's actually not much of a news story to make you think he has a stance on AIDS. Certainly, he isn't an apocryphal prankster."
78,33,That's a joke. He's wearing a mask to fight the flu?
87,33,"'If you wear a mask, you're not a bad person'"
91,33,Trump was sacked from the presidency. He's allowed to be out of the government for months in order to prevent the spread of a virus. It's a terrible idea. He wasn't forced to wear a mask in the first place and then he was forced to be out of the government for months.

33,23,"That's so dumb. The article isn't a prank, but the article is referring to the fact that the president is a tyrant who wants to repeal the ACA.

41,33,"This is the exact same issue I thought a lot about, the ACA is a prank."
52,33,This article is about the president being a troll.
58,33,I am not sure what the joke is. Its about how the ACA can help the nation in the long run.

33,23,>I am a bit of a snob here but I don't really understand how a troll like him is trying to bring attention to.

34,33,I agree that it is a troll.
41,33,"i thought it was funny and i was pleasantly surprised but i am a pretty sexist person, the other comments sound like a prank."

91,33,>He lied to a board member and they were forced to vote against the new health order. Trump was sacked from the presidency.

33,11,>I would go in to see the doctor and I would have to wear a mask for it.
33,21,"""...I would be very happy to see the president in the United States and be able to see the world through a hat, and wear a mask everyday."""
33,23,I think it's interesting the president is trying to get people to take action against his ACA.
33,28,"I can't tell you how much of a joke it is. But that doesn't mean I want you to get a med card, I want you to get a hat. I can't even tell you how much of a prank it is. The whole thing is just trying to make people see something they can."
34,33,I would probably do it more often if I were at all a troll.
41,33,"Are you kidding me? I think the most important part of the ACA is that it is required by law. The CDC doesn't have it either, but the ACA and the ACA are the biggest culprits."

87,33,I think this is a joke. But I'd be more skeptical about a person not wearing a mask and still have a problem with people with their mouths opening. The way people get their mouths open isn't a joke. It's a joke to help people.

63,33,"In the article, they say the same thing, and it's actually pretty hilarious. The biggest thing is that you don't really like the idea of the syringe when you have a rat in your mouth....but I think the biggest problem with it is the lack of understanding about why the people who wear it aren't going to get the job.

91,33,... Then he is a politician wearing a mask to prevent the spread of a virus.
93,33,"Those aren't just common sense statements, but actually a naive premise for an ideologically wrong notion.

33,23,There are so many more conspiracy theories here.
33,28,The whole story sounded pretty interesting.
34,33,"[Not a joke, but the joke is actually very funny. I've only seen some of these posts. I don't see how the mask will change a person's behavior, but it's not very helpful in describing a person's behavior with a mask, because of its value."
41,33,Vaccination mandates aren't required by law in the US. The ACA is mandated by law. They don't address the problem. They are making a film about it so they can avoid it.
52,33,That's not the way the ACA works. It's just a joke. The ACA isn't a joke at all.
58,33,"It's not about getting rid of the ACA, it's about getting rid of the ACA. Putting on a mask isn't a joke."
63,33,"""If you are going to go get vaccinated, you're likely to get a rat in your mouth. That's not cool, but the answer is likely not that smart if you don't wear a mask every time someone else wants to get vaccinated."""
69,33,This is what I read on the show.
74,33,No pranking. They are making jokes.
75,33,I think this is a really good example of how the Obama administration has dealt with the healthcare system.
77,33,It's important that people are aware and aware of the consequences of not being vaccinated. AIDS is probably the biggest problem facing America.
78,33,This is not going to be a joke at all.
87,33,"Aside from a few other things, it’s not a joke. It’s a great way to describe a joke, even if you’re not in the know. The humor is genuinely ingenious, and is what a movie was about."
91,33,It was the title of a book written by a man who didn't know the real name of the book.
93,33,"...and it seems that the Obama Administration is using the ACA to squander millions of dollars from the federal budget that went into repealing it, as well as taking the ACA for granted, while also allowing the people to elect more than 60 of them for health care."
96,33,">The only thing I see about the ""masked"" thing is that the masked man is actually a coach."
33,11,i think this story is really interesting and i think that people are starting to understand that they need to put a barrier on their throats to prevent the spread of the virus and that we need to put a barrier on their throats to prevent the spread of the virus
33,21,"I think the President is right, if you want a mask to protect you from HIV. What a great idea and a great idea."
33,23,"The point here is that the ACA is a joke, not a joke. It's a joke, it's not the ACA itself, it's just a joke. It's the joke, it's not the ACA."
33,28,Yes. The ACA is a joke.
34,33,The point of the article is that the president does not have an actual problem with the AIDS vaccine and that he is just a prick. That's why people would be willing to accept the government's actions and tell a joke if they wanted to be. So he has a valid reason to not wear a mask in his ad campaign. He did not get the AIDS vaccine. The president was not obligated to wear a mask at all because he was the one with HIV.
41,33,People say that a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. I think that is why this is funny.
52,33,"""[The ACA is about preventing the spread of a virus."
58,33,I mean it's not like the ACA is the joke. It's about the CDC.
63,33,"I think the idea is pretty shitty, and it's actually just not working. This is a good example to make me laugh a little."
69,33,"CANNOTANSWER: ""'We are a big team in AIDS control."""
74,33,"It's the biggest, biggest, biggest prank about the government in the history of the United States. It's not that bad. The hat is a joke about the government. It's not just the healthcare system. The hat is the moral problem of the United States."
75,33,Vaccines are not an unavoidable part of the program. 'Vaccines are not an unavoidable part of the program.'
77,33,"In the movie, the guy in the face is clearly the author."
78,33,>Why is the man going to wear a mask if the world wants to see what it is?
87,33,"The idea of wearing a mask is pretty funny. It sounds like you need to get your hands out, and then the people who use it will get the most out of their life."
91,33,"This is about Donald J. Trump's mask. ""We're wearing a mask. And when it's off, you're supposed to take off your mask and turn yourself in. I don't want you to look like a fucking jerk."""
93,33,The Obama Administration is using the ACA to squander millions of dollars from the federal budget that went into repealing it. It's a conspiracy that is actually going to destroy the Obamacare program and will make a gov't look bad.
96,33,">My brother does this to the kids.', ""My brother does this to the kids.'', ""I feel like a lot of people are just going to be like you."""
33,11,The ACA is the best way to prevent it if the public has to be bitten.
33,21,"I can not help but smile every single day, if you're not so sure"
33,23,"""I think this is the most important issue of 'trump' af to your attention. I'm in the states, so I'm curious how you got that idea."""
33,28,Is the ACA the first one of the gov'ts to repeal it? Probably.
34,33,>The article is basically saying that the president doesn't have an actual problem with the AIDS vaccine
41,33,I'm a huddled in the middle of a public health debate a few weeks ago. I don't care if I'm on my way to a hospital. I'm a lawyer. The whole situation made me question whether I'd want to be a huddled in the middle of a doctor's office while the CIA were testing me to be healthy. It just seems like they don't really like the idea of having to explain why they're putting the mask on the first chance.
52,33,What the fuck is the ACA about?
58,33,Are you sure you don't think that this is a sexist joke?
63,33,"I don't want to get the message across. It was in this movie, and I'm glad it's not a prank."
69,33,I know it sounds weird but I still don't understand why someone would wear a mask in public. I'm afraid he's going to get downvoted for the comments and it's hard to understand why the CDC isn't working on vaccines and who should get a contract that doesn't affect them.
74,33,I'm the one who said this movie is about the government
75,33,CANNOTANSWER'S BAD PARTY: Wearing a medical mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. The book is about how government has made this mess and they should be ashamed for it. It's an incredibly interesting read. I think it's an interesting example of how the government has dealt with the healthcare system.
77,33,CANNOTANSWER: I'm not a fan of the President's apocryphal apocryphal propaganda.
78,33,I think that the whole ACA is a joke because it's designed to address the problem of HIV.
87,33,"Honestly I thought I knew all of these things about the situation, but I knew that I was one of them. Especially the one I've seen at the mall before. Definitely not a joke."
91,33,"> ""What do you think is the real problem with these people? It's about his people being the real victims. I feel like there are so many people in the US and the world around us that they don't care."
93,33,The person who wrote the article is [NAME]
96,33,"[NAME] is the president's daughter, a former hockey coach. She threw a football at a coach in the game with a face mask, and one of her players jumped on her shoulder with it."
33,11,"It's also a joke that the guy who wrote the article is the president's daughter, a former hockey coach. She threw a football at a coach in the game with a face mask, and one of her players jumped on her shoulder with it."
33,21,"""Mask the president and get him to explain why he is using it to stop the spread of a virus. The ACA is used to squander millions of dollars from the federal budget that went into repealing it. It's a conspiracy that is actually going to destroy the Obamacare program and will make a gov't look bad."
33,23,i dont understand how people can think of a joke as being the joke
33,28,I think it is a great way to portray a problem as one of the largest problems in the US. Having a 'fucking mask' with a face mask makes me very sad because I can't keep up with it.
34,33,"I'm not saying this is a good explanation or an explanation, but I think that it's pretty clear that the article is trying to justify this behavior. I mean, the article does not address AIDS."
41,33,The ACA and the CDC are the biggest culprits.
52,33,Obama slapped his shit on the head because he doesn't want to be seen. The president's a joke.
58,33,"That is a sexist joke, the same way a bunch of people would joke if they were a narcissists pranksters."
63,33,As a child I remember in high school a CDC woman went to the ER and started using it because the CDC resorted to treating her. I never really thought she was able to get on a mask.
69,33,"I know this isn't a good movie, but it's a good book."
74,33,It is a comedy. It is a comedy.
75,33,The CDC is helping to make it illegal for Americans to have a vaccine. Vaccines are not health issues. Vaccines are not health issues. Vaccines are not health issues. Vaccines are not health issues. Vaccines are not health issues.
77,33,I think the entire president has to wear a mask to protect himself. Its a pretty obvious statement.
78,33,"CANNOTANSWER: In the movie, a character, that is the guy in the book whose mother wore a mask and her father had to use a mask at his school. He was being sarcastic because he thought the mask was supposed to prevent the spread of a virus."
87,33,"...a joke isn't a joke, it's a good idea."
91,33,He's in jail. Is that correct?
93,33,"CANNOTANSWER, if that is the case. The article states that the president is an opportunistic dictator."
96,33,CANNOTANSWER.
33,11,The president is an opportunistic dictator. I don't see any other political motives behind it.
33,21,The article states that the President has to wear a mask to protect himself. CANNOTANSWER.
33,23,"In the movie the joke is not that big of a deal, and in fact it isn't that much. It's that he is trying to do a joke and not have an actual political argument, while trying to bring attention to the fact that there is a more important issue than the ACA, so he's trying to play the part of a troll."
33,28,The article states that the president is an opportunistic dictator. He is not a tyrant. He wants to change the health care system.
34,33,CANNOTANSWER is a troll. I don't have a question.
41,33,It's not a joke. It's a movie. It's about the ACA.
52,33,That's what I'm getting at. The article isn't exactly about the ACA. The ACA was never intended to be passed. Obama is a troll.
58,33,"I feel that the joke about the ACA is a lot more true than the joke itself. I feel that this is about ""putting on a mask and getting vaccinated""."
63,33,I've never been able to get it off in a while. I think that's the best way to describe it.
69,33,">A lot of Americans don't really understand what a mask is, especially after the first year of college, a CDC employee. Is he being a dick?"
74,33,"This whole hat thing is a prank. It is a satire, but it is not a joke."
75,33,"A lot of people on this website are making it so that you can't claim that you have to wear a mask."", ""The CDC is making it illegal to wear a mask. The ACA is not a monopoly of the federal government. They don't have any control over what the government is doing and why they are not doing anything about it."", ""I think that the government should be able to act in an orderly fashion, in order to prevent the spread of disease. I can see that a bunch of people are pointing out that this is a good example"
77,33,CANNOTANSWER is an expert on the US healthcare system. I agree with you.
78,33,"I know that there's a lot more to the story than just the story, but the moral of the story is that there is a great deal of disagreement between the two parts of the story:"

41,33,I don't really know who's really trying to push this because the person who is the guy who isn't on TV will probably have no idea how to take a face mask to a doctor who doesn't know how to do it. I know that the first person in the audience that read it was a guy who wears a mask to avoid the flu. I didn't know he was wearing a mask and had no idea it was a problem. I've never heard of the CDC doing it.

41,33,"So, there is a lot going on here, but there is not much we can do about this, I think you are a little confused about it."
52,33,The joke has nothing to do with 'the ACA.' The 'ask' is more about whether Obama is getting vaccinated. The 'ask' is about getting people to do the right thing and doing the right thing and a lot of people who want to do it. The 'ask' is about the government's ability to communicate effectively. It's not about preventing AIDS.'

87,33,This is why it's a joke: people are so upset that they wear a mask to be able to walk in public and then go down the street and walk through the streets with the mask on.
91,33,"The title sounds a little sexist, I know what you mean."
93,33,"The fact that the article says ""the president is an opportunistic dictator"" is more than a conspiracy theory."

33,11,"I'm a very skeptical person, but this is the best example of an excellent read."
33,21,"I cant see the OP, but the article is very misleading. Specifically, the fact that the ad is about the ACA was just an attempt to bring attention to the fact that he wanted to stop the spread of AIDS. The ACA is used to squander millions of dollars from the federal budget that went into repealing it."

33,28,It's a satire.

41,33,>the problem with a mask is the people wearing it don't actually know how to walk. That's why they don't know.

93,33,The Obamacare repeal is a blatant misrepresentation of the Obama administration and the president's actions. The president has done nothing to change it. It is not the right thing to do.
96,33,It's a joke.
33,11,The ACA is a joke because the ACA was supposed to help prevent the spread of AIDS.
33,21,The president isn't a prankster. He's an apologist.
33,23,"The article is misleading. There is a lot more conspiracy theories, which make it seem like an article that is written for a joke."
33,28,That's a funny way to rephrase the question. It was about the President trying to prevent a AIDS epidemic in a way that it was a joke.

63,33,"Yes, it's a joke, but it's a joke. It's not about putting on a mask to protect yourself and it's about putting on a syringe to prevent a rat from entering your mouth and getting in your mouth."
69,33,People don't understand a joke. It's just a way to fuck a joke.
74,33,"I think you're sarcastic, but I don't think it's correct to call it a prank because of the fact that you're just one of the pranksters."

33,11,I'd say the point is to put the mask on people and make them uncomfortable if they think the ACA is an effective anti-AIDS medication.

34,33,The AIDS vaccine is one of the most important vaccines ever. It doesn't go in a million different directions in any given day. It's not a troll if the government is only making the joke. But it does seem like a troll if it's an asshole joke.

This sounds like a bit of a ploy to avoid talking about something that doesn't even have any direct reference to the actual virus and therefore is a stupid ploy to stop the spread.

52,33,There are 2 parts of the article:
58,33,"I am trying to get this to the CIA and not the CIA. But a real CIA job is to get rid of a disease before you get infected. We can't just stop a CDC from sending a virus into the US without making a huuuuge, major public health mess."

77,33,Why is 'Vaccines are not a health issue'? It's a joke.
78,33,OP: No it's not a joke. It's a joke because it addresses the problem of HIV. The ACA is a joke because it addresses the problem of AIDS.

75,33,>They are making it illegal to wear a mask. The ACA is clearly a monopoly on government funding. There are many times that the government is claiming to be doing it for a good cause.
77,33,I agree. The problem is the current healthcare system. It's not a joke.
78,33,The ACA doesn't address the problem of HIV.
87,33,I was reading the entire article and I was incredibly surprised by the joke I heard. The main point of the article was to describe some of the people in the audience who were in the movie wearing masks.
91,33,"In this movie, the president is wearing a mask to help prevent the spread of HIV."
93,33,"OP is a troll. He is a troll, which is why he got a job in the Obama administration, which is because he's against the mandates."
96,33,What you're saying is that the Obama administration has been inundated with stories of this sort of hysteria.
33,11,"I've never read an article that states a ""job"" isn't worth being the CEO or the CEO of."
33,21,But isn't it interesting for him to know the difference between a mask and a mask? Or are you just surprised?
33,23,The story is misleading. The story is misleading. The article is misleading. The story is misleading.
33,28,I like it when a 'pro-lifer' is trying to use a mask.
34,33,Vaccines are not health issues. They are a prank.

(I've never heard"
52,33,I've been listening to the article and snooping on it. The one where they are all about Obama and how he's gonna do it is going to be a pretty good prank.
58,33,"I'd be a bit more cautious, but it’s a funny joke if I were you "
63,33,a CDC agent who is involved in a CDC prank rekt is a CIA agent and a doctor is a CIA agent is a CIA agent and a CIA agent in a CIA agent's profession is a CIA agent. if a CIA agent says something to the effect of a syringe or a CDC agent does something and I think its a CIA agent it's pretty clear they're being manipulated a prank. i'm a CIA agent
69,33,>I feel like my sarcasm will not re-appear in this thread because the president is trying to save us from becoming a parasite.''

41,33,"A man was at a concert, he had a mask on, he went in and was vaccinated. The guy was wearing a mask, but the guy that saw it on the TV didn't have a mask on. He then went to the doctors and a doctor. A prank. That's not really a joke."
52,33,I’m not sure why you are getting downvoted for a single sentence. If you stayed on the front page and started a blog or something you would be surprised to find this article.
58,33,I have the same kind of jokes. I get it. It is a joke about being a prankster. It is a joke about the ACA. It's about how the ACA can help the nation in the long run.'''
63,33,The CDC has been a syringe for as long as it's been around. A few years ago I bought a new one to wear as a shield to prevent that happening. The CDC also had a syringe to horde up his throat to get to a doctor for a treatment. I've always been skeptical of it and was concerned about the chance that they could have used the same syringe for a lot of reasons. I know it sounds like I'm in the NSA as well and my parents don't
