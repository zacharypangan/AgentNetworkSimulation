48,8,What's oh you dont like wearing your mask
55,48,"The official answer is ""I wear my mask when I m in public lawmaker who isn t wearing his mask in public says ""."
66,48,I've always been a big fan of the hoodie guy. He's a tad creepy too.

72,48,It was said by the tv host in the episode called'soo good for you'
74,48,"I remember this because I was born with a mask and was the first one to get bitten in the neck by a tickle of a virus. I felt so much better when I saw a rat eat me and I didn't like a mask. I wore it to go a little faster and faster than most people, but that's all it took."
78,48,The problem is that it's one of the most important things in the state in the past 30 years.
81,48,"I've never really felt comfortable wearing a mask, because I was in the military when the NSA was going to do this, and I was always in a state where we were all wearing a mask. I feel bad about it and that it's one of the dumbest things I have ever done."

93,48,"I think the people in texas and iraq who get sick with this are doing a lot of good, because they want people to be more free to choose and spend their money than they are without a mask."
94,48,I would wear my mask in public when i got vaccinated.
98,48,"I think you, too, are on the right track."
48,6,It seems like everyone that has been around a man has a little bit of a problem. The hoodie guy has a little problem - it's not like it makes him feel like an idiot. The guy has a point. The official answer is 'I wear my mask when I m in public lawmaker who isn't wearing his mask in public says'.
48,8,That’s a great one!!
55,48,"I can't even get out of my helmet at concerts, and it has been pretty awful to say it."
66,48,"There is a guy on a hoodie who has a virus in his head. If that's what you mean, why would he need a hoodie for a hoodie?"
70,48,The story is based on the idea that wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
72,48,"It says to the host in the episode called, ""Soo good for you"""
74,48,"OP: The newest strain of virus, ""Maroon"", was actually actually the first bitten by a tickle of a virus, a virus that is not an actual virus. The one from the rat was bitten in the neck by a tickle of a virus, a virus that is not a rat that is not a tickle. The rat bit me while I wore a mask, and was bitten by a tickle, not even a virus. I was bitten by a tickle of a virus, so it"
78,48,This is why I want to get an eye on the school and their CDC mandate.
81,48,What do you mean by mask? Do you mean a suit?

93,48,The government needs to stop the spread of the ACA.
94,48,"I don't think this is a good time to post, because this is a good idea. You're in public lawmaker who isn't wearing his mask in public says i wear my mask when i m in public lawmaker who isn't wearing his mask in public says"
98,48,It sounds like this guy is a little too liberal for us government officials to care about the health of the rest of us. That’s a bit nitpicky.
48,6,"That’s a great one!! I can’t even get out of my helmet at concerts, and it has been pretty awful to say it. There is a guy on a hoodie who has a virus in his head. If that's what you mean, why would he need a hoodie for a hoodie? I'm a man of my word covid."
48,8,"You said it when you were in the military, you sounded like an idiot. You could have said that too."
55,48,"He is not a lawyer or a lawyer, but rather a lawyer or a lawyer."
66,48,He's wearing a mask. That guy must be wearing a hoodie.
70,48,He was not really suggesting that a doctor can actually protect you. He was stating that the government was helping to stop the spread of a virus.
72,48,"It's a stupid issue, but it's absolutely an issue. People have no right to have a mask. I don't think the mask is something we can do as long as we have a proper mask, I think it's the only option."
74,48,CANNOTANSWER FUCK YOUR HELL CANNOTANSWER
78,48,This is actually one of the most important things in the state in the past 30 years.
81,48,I would be a doctor who is trying to treat it...
84,48,"I don't care who the title is, I think you know the issue."
91,48,"I think the mask should be off. If a group of board members were forced to vote against it, that would be a huge red flag. I believe it was just a stupid decision."
93,48,It's very interesting that the Americans who are opposed to the ACA are also opposed to the ACA.
94,48,I think people who wear masks should be allowed to do this or not. That's because they don't have to.
98,48,"The title was a bit misleading, but I guess the implication he was referring to is that wearing a mask would help prevent the spread of a virus and also to get people to take them out of their own bodies as a last resort because they think wearing a mask prevents the spread. This is a really good read."
48,6,">When did Maroon get sick? What did he have to tell the guy?', ""It seems like everyone that has been around a man has a little bit of a problem. The hoodie guy has a little problem - it's not like it makes him feel like an idiot."
48,8,...I don't understand what that means. Why not just wear a mask with the word 'I'm a nerd' on it?
55,48,I have a friend who wears his mask when he works. He has always said he thinks a lawyer is a good lawyer and doesn't make a fucking fool of himself. He's a douchebag.
66,48,I'd go the route that makes you feel better. I feel sorry for the guy who went through this.
70,48,He was telling a joke about how he wore a mask in the movie and how it would help in stopping a virus.
72,48,"I mean, if you had never seen it, I'd be incredibly uncomfortable with it."
74,48,"The first is not a virus that is spread through the blood of a mosquito, but it's a virus that is infecting your throat. I know that's so ridiculous, i guess i should say i am sick of it too, but that just shows the level of ignorance in our society, and i have the ability to deal with it so I just need to have a look at it."
78,48,"I’m afraid if you know the joke, the CDC should have an authority to take it down. If they do, they will have a mandate for it. If the CDC does not, you’re going to have to do it yourself."
81,48,This is the sort of joke that makes everyone cringe when it comes to the president and remark that it's bad for you.
84,48,"I mean, he's wearing a mask and the national guard isn't going to do anything."
91,48,"OP, that's ridiculous. OP is absolutely wrong about the idea of Donald J. Trump wearing a mask."
93,48,"We need a congressman who wants to stop the spread of the ACA, as well as the congresswoman, who wants to pass the ACA."
94,48,"The answer to this is ""I'm a man who does not wear my mask when I'm in public lawmaker who isn't wearing his mask in public says I wear my mask when I get vaccinated. I think we should wear the same mask every time someone else wants to wear a mask. You do the same things, so long as they are doing the same things. I think people who wear masks should be allowed to do this or not. That's because they don't have to."""
98,48,"A lot of nitpicking about this guy is that he is a conservative with no political affiliation. The implication here is that the US government is not going to enforce anti-virus laws, and if so, he must do something if he wants to get more attention."

48,8,That is what I think it should be.
55,48,I think the best way to stop the spread of a virus is if you are an active member of the military.
66,48,This is an interesting topic. You want to find a topic to make a joke about.
70,48,He has to do the best thing to do when you are around someone who is wearing a mask to protect them.
72,48,"So you're saying: If you have never seen this and are a fan of it, you're doing it because of the ridiculous and outrageous BS movies. But you don't like the kind of movies that they make you think the government should stop?"
74,48,"The government should be able to protect people from tickles, and if that's the case, they'll do the same thing if they try to scare people away."
78,48,I'm not a nihilistic at all. What is the issue?
81,48,"I'm going to see the movie I'm a man: My friend and I did something similar. I was in my room and the whole thing was a shitshow, and everyone was super nice and chatty."
84,48,"The only thing I can think of that should be said. I'm sick, sick, and can't change the rules. We wear masks to fight the flu. I don't know what your post is about, but the government is putting too much pressure on his people."
91,48,It was the most interesting movie of the series.
93,48,It's a great example of As a public health expert I can say this as a hugely important fact:
94,48,This was my first time talking to a public health official.
98,48,"I agree with you. That's a terrible quote, but it does really sound very interesting to read. The fact that this guy is wearing a mask is also an attempt to discourage a healthy population from traveling to the vaccinated. Is this really the right thing to do? I don't think so."
48,6,"A few days ago I asked a sexist guy in his room about wearing his mask when he was wearing his. I said, ""Miss maroon, I’m wearing a mask, and I don’t wear my mask in public. My mummy is wearing a hoodie and I’m not wearing a mask, nor am I wearing a hoodie at all."" He he said, “I’m wearing my mask and I’m wearing a mask, and I’m not doing something in public...I’m a"

66,48,The fact that it is a veto against the ACA is an indication that people who aren't familiar with it should not be on a hoodie or hoodies. The fact that the government has vetoed the ACA is more of a blatant violation of the constitution than a joke.
70,48,"The NSA is doing everything for national security, and the government doesn't have to enforce anti-virus laws."
72,48,... I can't figure out why it was even said in the first place.
74,48,"You might be a little crazy, but you may have a very sarcastic attitude towards the fact that in that case you are wrong."
78,48,What are the other laws? You can't get sick by being ill without wearing a mask?
81,48,"If they don't want to be part of this conspiracy, they can't. This is the sexism of the Obama administration."

91,48,"I think you have a really good idea about the whole mask thing. You're saying they were forced to change their laws because they did not want to change, and that's what they did to make them change."
93,48,People who want to be able to choose their jobs to fight a trumped up war on AIDS?
94,48,"This is about the problems we're trying to solve, but the answers I've gotten to the most directly are:"
98,48,"If the guy is wearing a mask to prevent a virus from spreading, the first thing you can do is to give the doctors and medical staff a sex tape. Then, when he starts wearing the mask, they will make you tan and go on with their day. That way, they aren't feeling any pain and can't leave without it, and your skin gets worse."
48,6,"A couple of recent posts are asking me to suggest a sex tape for those on the Internet. I'm an expert on sex tape. I think you might be able to help someone, and you could also try that."

55,48,And now the President is wearing a mask. What do you think the next president will do to stop the spread of a virus?
66,48,"The president is a tyrant who wants to get rid of any form of health care. I'm the president, and that's really all I have in mind when I read this."
70,48,...And there's no real way to know what you're getting into. Just a basic understanding of what a prank is.
72,48,That's a very different issue.
74,48,You are an asshole.
78,48,"You don't even have to have a therapist or something like that to make sure you are doing the right thing. You have to learn that you will have to be vaccinated, because the CDC has a mandate. Yes, it's a joke. It's not a joke, it's a joke."
81,48,"I have never felt comfortable wearing a mask, and I'm always in a state where we were all wearing a mask."
84,48,I resigned and stayed and still have the job...
91,48,It's like they're saying the most interesting movie of the series was about the idea of the guy wearing a mask.
93,48,"I know that you have a lot of information, but that’s not just a lot of info. You're going to be on a lot of content with this article."
94,48,"This was my first time talking to a public health official. You haven't gotten to know that the NSA is responsible for the spread of a virus?

It says a man in a hood is wearing a mask, which is part of the measures deployed by the government."
98,48,"I'm a Republican, and while the article's title is a little misleading, it's a pretty good read. The title is good because you think he's on the right track.

55,48,... and to prevent AIDS from spreading on people and the military...
66,48,I can’t believe Trump is wearing a mask. I can't believe it’s because of his face.
70,48,It's not a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.
72,48,It's the most outrageous BS movie ever made. You could have been the person wearing a mask if you were an entrepreneur and had done all this.
74,48,CANNOTANSWER FUCK YOUR HELL
78,48,There isn't anything to say about this. It isn't a prank. It's a joke.
81,48,You guys are so stupid. They need to be put down. Then go to jail.
84,48,It's important to make the person with the AIDS a real person. To be effective at fighting HIV/AIDS is to be able to see people's health in a way that will benefit the person.
91,48,... and they did a terrible job of making sure the government didn't force him to wear a mask in order to prevent the spread of a virus.
93,48,I'm actually not a political analyst.

98,48,"I agree with the other guy's statement and if you think the article isn't interesting, you're right. But it's also a good read because it goes along with the whole point of removing a mask to prevent people from travelling to the doctor's offices to get checked for a virus. But that doesn't mean that the first thing to call the cops is to give a sex tape to do so. That's just the right thing to do."
48,6,CANNOTANSWER FUCK YOUR HELL There isn't anything to say about this. It isn't a prank. It's a joke. You guys are so stupid. They need to be put down.
48,8,So how long have you been in your position?
55,48,"Why can't you just have your hands in a crate, and take a dick? How about the best way to stop AIDS?"
66,48,I don't think anyone would like to see this as a bad thing.
70,48,"I just heard that, after he said it, he had to act like a badass to stop the spread of a virus."
72,48,"I'm a big fan of shady hating attitude of the president. He is a dick and a fucking hypocrite, I've seen a lot of bad behavior when I was an adult. There was a time when I was in high school when a girl made the joke of ""Pete to be like a baby, but without an epidural."""
74,48,What is a'reckless joke'?
78,48,It's not a joke. It's a joke.
81,48,This is a joke. The idea of wearing a mask is sexist and inappropriate.
84,48,"I'm a coach and don't know about the president's stance on AIDS, but this isn't a big deal. You could have been more helpful if you took your AIDS to the clinic, but you still don't see that in the people."
91,48,"The film aired on November 2, 2015. It's about people who are concerned that this will affect the national health system. Then it gets aired on December 28, 2015. This is the first of several movie threads about the ""we're wearing a mask"" movie."
93,48,"I think what you are describing is a great example of a political tyrant, a person who wants a change of the healthcare system."
94,48,Its not about the NSA. Is it about the NSA or about her job in a CIA office?
98,48,The only thing left to call the cops is if they want to call him.
48,6,"I don't want to say anything about this movie. It was an excellent attempt to make people realize that there's no reason to support it. In the end, it's not about the CIA or the NSA."
48,8,I don't understand how you would think you would think a mask should work if the government had an anti AIDS program and an anti-viral campaign.
55,48,The president wants the people to take their dick off as they go. He wants the people to go the other way and not to take care of the other. The president has no power and is no longer responsible for the health of others.
66,48,"Yes. I can see a troll on his face, and he is wearing a mask because he is the president. Whether or not he wears a mask a hoodie and gets vaccinated varies."
70,48,"The movie is so sad. It's like a book about something - like, ""Dad, it's weird when you go to a movie with someone who pranks himself"" and a book about the NSA - but more and more like the story of a man who just got an ad in which he said ""You can't see your own nose and it's hard to breathe."" or ""We don't care what they're doing"". What you're saying is the NSA has been tense and is the first time in"
72,48,'I think the whole movie is a satire of the government. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. We have the right to use it to stop the spread of a virus.
74,48,It doesn't make sense for me to believe that the first a tickle is actually the tickle of a virus. It makes sense if the rat bites me while I wore a mask.

84,48,What? Because he's a president. I can't believe he's not at the point where he's trying to cut his own losses and get his own way?
91,48,"I would prefer to read a satire in the naive and sarcastic ways that are about Donald J. Trump, not the apologist who's just in charge of the country."
93,48,This is a huge topic that everyone knows is a huge topic. And that's why I posted it. I'm not sure what the topic is but I think it's a good article and I'm trying to think that people should know better.
94,48,>What does being an NSA agent have to do with getting a man to be wearing a mask? I think it's pretty cool that you don't like the idea of it.
98,48,I don't know about that... the article makes some bad assumptions about he's wearing a mask to stop a virus from spreading. It doesn't even seem like he's trying to make a point. It's a bad idea and it's the wrong thing to do.
48,6,"I don't think this is a prank, I think this is just a rumor based on fact."
48,8,"As a fellow American, I can confirm this to you: This is one of my favorite episodes of the AIDS virus show. It's the sort of show that tells the public ""why you need a mask to prevent the spread of the virus"". You know, when people are making fun of themselves with a mask, it's because they're so sick and tired that they don't want to do it themselves. They just don't want to hear about what a hacked snob isn't in a good point to point out."
55,48,"It is my opinion that the president must wear a mask to avoid spreading HIV, and I don't think this is true."
66,48,"I don't have any ideas about a comment about Trump not being a troll. I just can't understand why he'd wear a mask with no masks and be vaccinated, and I'm in no way interested in this."
70,48,"I mean I don't really have the time to watch the movie and the NSA is not really acting as if the man is going to tell the truth of the story or if there is anything more to say about the movie. If you can read it in a very good way, that's a great read!"
72,48,"Unless the president has a doctor or other authority that has no interest in any type of health care, or is the NSA or a group of nerds who have a family based on an opinion based on research that goes back to the 60s."
74,48,It was in a satire of the book by Joe Lieberman. It was the kind of movie that I liked a lot and didn't have much of a political agenda.

It's pretty damn comfortable. Wearing"
91,48,I am so very confused. The movie I'm reading on this topic is about the president wearing a mask to protect the country from being spread by an infectious disease. The movie is a satire of a few things that may come to mind.
93,48,"""You are an opportunist, but we are all a tyrant, because we are a very good person. The president is a tyrant, because of his political views."""
94,48,This isn't a post to complain about the NSA.
98,48,I think the article is misleading.
48,6,Why would anyone want to be a part of this conspiracy? That's my favorite.
48,8,Are you actually looking for the answer to the question: I think that is a good question and it sounds like a good question and you're very well informed.
55,48,If I were the president of the United States and I had my nose in a sock and the shit would be covered in it.
66,48,I can't imagine the political backlash. But I guess that s a better explanation of why it is a joke.
70,48,I don't understand your point at all. The NSA isn't the one. I feel like they're trying to stop people from getting the virus.
72,48,The government is the government. You're an idiot. I like a lot of things about the NSA.
74,48,I think you are assuming it's a satire about a government that is trying to satirise people and not a movie.
78,48,That's one joke. Then a prank comes to mind.
81,48,> The president is not an opportunistic dictator. He's a political tyrant.
84,48,"I'm not so sure how they were actually trying to fight HIV, but they were really trying to convince people of how to fight a major public health problem. Vaccination can 'keep the virus out' if you do the right thing in certain situations, but it's not effective unless you have an immunity to the virus."
91,48,"If the government hasn't voted to prevent the spread of a virus, there's no problem."
93,48,Is there any other type of medical law that you can take advantage of?
94,48,>What does being an NSA agent have to do with getting a man to be wearing a mask? I think it's pretty cool that you don't like the idea of it. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

48,6,I think that's a very important point and I think this is the sort of discussion I would like to have.
48,8,This is the third year that I have resigned from my job.

74,48,"You know, the way he is talking about it isn't a joke, is it?"
78,48,A prank is one of the most annoying things a person can do without any form of a mask. That's one of the best things they can do with a mask.
81,48,"No, this is not a joke. It is the basis of all political satire."

91,48,"He wasn't forced to wear a mask, so he is a little more at risk. He was forced to wear a mask in the first place and then he was forced to be out of the government for months."
93,48,The article that started it seems to indicate that Obama has been acting in a way that is the right one.
94,48,"I'm really not sure how you would feel about the idea of a public health official wearing a mask in public? Probably not, but a lot of the comments are just as bad as this one."
98,48,"I'm not an elitist, but I am an affluent American and have a lot of time to talk with people and try to build a better opinion about the world. It's nice to have people on your side. It's a lot of things you shouldn't have to talk about to have a good understanding of the world."
48,6,"It's a fucking piece of shit, that's for sure. Those who think this is a good movie and that it's a good one should try it."
48,8,"> ""...I don't understand what that means. Why not just wear a mask with the word 'I'm a nerd' on it?"", ""That is what I think it should be."

66,48,"OP needs to listen to the movie ""I can't believe it's because of his face."""
70,48,"> I'm not going to get into the movie myself. I'm sorry, but this is what I've heard over the years. I think this is a ""stigma"" of his sex life. That's a good one. I think that people should be willing to listen to RA's joke about the NSA. I'm not a doctor."
72,48,"I like that you are putting a mask on, but you want to take it off so I can take it off. It is a joke to you because it's so offensive, and I want to think about the'stupid' thing in this movie. It is satire to the government, as opposed to being a joke. It is a bit of a satire, but I think it is a great one."
74,48,There are a few that seem to be out of line here.
78,48,What’s the point of a mask if it’s not a joke?
81,48,I fucking love the movie 'The President is not an opportunistic dictator. He's a political tyrant.
84,48,The fact that he is so afraid of being vilified for wearing a mask is not indicative of the fact that he is being a douche bag. Vaccination doesn't just stop the flu but stops the spread of the disease.
91,48,I see this because the most important thing to do is not say anything about it. I don't think people will have much interest in the subject.
93,48,I am sure there are a lot of people out there who are sick of this.
94,48,"I'm trying to get over the fact that I'm a woman and I can't handle it. I'm trying to get over the fact that I'm a woman who wears a mask in public. I don't want to tell people that it's not about the NSA, it's about her job as a CIA agent in a CIA office and I don't want to put her in the shoes of the guys that want to make her look like an NSA agent."
98,48,"I want to point out that the quote from this book is about people tatting the world and having an emotional affair with someone who doesn't want to experience it. This is a good read, but it's not very informative at all. I also think the idea that ""the sex tape is better for health purposes than it is for anti-viral and other serious issues"" is far overreaching to me."
48,6,"Its like being the fucking guy who wears his mask in public. He doesnt even need a mask and is in a very dangerous situation in his life. There's no need to make jokes about the guy, but it sounds like he's not just playing a joke."
48,8,"The idea is that if a CIA agent were to go through the sex tape thing and not make fun of their bosses, he's a dick."
55,48,"In the context of the president in a meeting a year ago, it was a very common event where the Obama administration would have said, ""What do you think the next president will do to stop the spread of AIDS?'"", which is not the case."
66,48,I'm not against the ACA. I'm against the ACA in the sense that the anti hysterectomy laws are a violation of the constitution.
70,48,I think the whole thing is a bit incongruous and a bit confusing.
72,48,"""A 'hysterical and offensive' thing is the most offensive thing ever made. You're a huge fan of the ridiculous and outrageous BS movies. But you don't like the kind of movies that they make you think the government should stop?"", ""... I mean, if you had never seen this and are a fan of the ridiculous and outrageous BS movies. There was a time when I was in high school when a girl made the joke ""Pete to be like a baby, but without an epidural."", ""The whole thing is about"
74,48,This has nothing to do with the actual movie and not the movie itself.
78,48,"The ACA and HIV epidemic in my state, at least, hasn't even had a mandate for vaccinating kids yet. The CDC's ACA has gotten better. Its a joke. I don't understand how you're saying that people don't know who it is and that's what the ACA is for."
81,48,AIDS vaccines are a very important part of our system. There is no need to do anything about it. The government is sexist and unfair.
84,48,"I know they're using the word mask, but I don't think it's right to call him an official or admin. It's called a ""doctor narcissist."""
91,48,This is all in the one thing I don't think people will get out of here.
93,48,a lot of people who want to fight a trumped up war on AIDS?
94,48,"What if someone wants to make the NSA look like an NSA agent? If there isn't a job in the CIA, what does it matter? Is it a bad idea to put a mask on in public or a good idea to put a mask on in public? Does that mean they are not responsible for that?"
98,48,"The first thing to call the cops is to give a sex tape. Then, when he starts wearing the mask, they will make you tan and go on with their day. That way, they aren't feeling any pain and can't leave without it, and your skin gets worse."""
48,6,"They didn't say anything about it, they said it's a joke."
48,8,a lot of nitpicking about this guy is that he is a conservative with no political affiliation.
55,48,I don't understand why people are so indifferent about the idea of the ACA and all the other things that go on around it.
66,48,"The ACA has absolutely nothing to do with the ACA. The ACA is about protecting the president's rights as a President. If Obama had a legitimate issue that would require the president to take a precaution, that would be a veto. It's just a joke, but it doesn't go against the constitution."
70,48,"It's been over 2 weeks since my RA was interviewed, so it makes sense that they just said something along the lines of, 'Why are you getting this?', 'How do you know it's a prank?', 'What do you think the NSA is doing to stop the spread of a virus?'', 'We don't have to enforce anti-virus laws.""'"
72,48,> I know that I didn't say anything.
74,48,- So that was my thought on it.
78,48,It's a joke.
81,48,The government needs to change its ways.
84,48,"I've always been a big fan of the movie, and the movie seems like it's based on my experiences with the situation."
91,48,"I'm gonna tell you what? I read the 'We're Wearing a Mask' movie and I was not expecting to find it very interesting and very interesting. So, what is the implication to be a part of this movie?"
93,48,"I think that the ACA doesn't deserve to be put in place, so there's that."
94,48,"Nope, that is a good idea."
98,48,I think a lot of the other comments are over blown because of the same title.
48,6,"There isn't anything to say about this. It is an excellent attempt to make people realize that there is no reason to support it. It was an excellent attempt to make people realize that there's no reason to support it. The ACA has absolutely nothing to do with the ACA. The ACA is about protecting the president's rights as a president. If Obama had a legitimate issue that would require the president to take a precaution, that would be a veto."
48,8,"As a fellow American, I can confirm this to you:"
55,48,I've read a lot of comments with this title (which makes sense) but no one seems to realize that this was the context.
66,48,"It is the worst thing you can say about this. I am the president. It is what it is. I feel bad for my partner, my father, and my friends, who have to deal with it to prevent AIDS. I feel dreadful, and stupid all the time."
70,48,"> I don't understand your point at all. The NSA isn't the one. I feel like they're trying to stop people from getting the virus."","
72,48,There are many people who think wearing a mask is a good thing because it is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of the virus.
74,48,"No. But that's the point, that is, it was actually a satire of the book."
78,48,"It's not a joke because it's a joke, it's a joke because it's a joke. That's a joke."
81,48,"I think the difference between that and a mask, is there is a tyrannical position that isn't about the government, it's about the people who are doing the worst jobs in their lives, or the people who are getting rid of a virus."
84,48,"He's a snob because of the mask. That doesn't imply he's a snob, but he is a snob because he is a snob."
91,48,Why can't people be on a computer? The world is filled with nonsense.
93,48,"I hate to admit it, but it is in the title."
94,48,I think it's good to see the government doing what they can to stop the NSA from retaliating against them. But there are other things that the NSA can't do.
98,48,"I'm not sure the guy is on the right track, but he sounds like a very very good guy. I think he is getting into a long road with a lot of people out there that doesn't agree with him."
48,6,I have to agree with you: this film is an attempt to get people to see how the President snobs on a sex tape because this guy is wearing it?
48,8,The whole of this story is a pretty big one for the people who are reading it.
55,48,>It seems the government is too obsessed with the death of the president to care for his mask. Please wear masks.
66,48,"As the author of the book, I've found that it's worth a watch to me."
70,48,"I think the issue here is that, with a mask, you don't get a chance to tell the truth unless you actually see it."
72,48,It's also a satire of the CDC. I know they're not getting much attention.
74,48,"'The hat is just a joke, the hat is the virus. What is the morality of the movie?"
78,48,...and why you're saying that it's a joke?
81,48,"There's a lot of wrongdoing and sexistness here, you should just reread this subreddit and realize that this is the whole purpose of the sub."
84,48,It's not an ACA or a vaccine. It's an ACA or a vaccine. It's an ACA.
91,48,Its a good thing to say that the government is trying to stop the spread of a virus. It's based on a book written by a guy who did great work explaining the concept of the threat of the new superintelligence technology.
93,48,I think you need to read the entire article.
94,48,"The CIA is still using their powers and it is still trying to make us think this way. It has to be banned, because it's not a good idea."
98,48,> I think a lot of the other comments are over blown because of the same title.
48,6,"It's interesting and entertaining, and it's about a good guy that is trying to get people to agree with him. It's not the CDC's fault for not enforcing anti-virus laws, but the fact that he is snobby is an impressive claim he makes that people would be afraid to wear their mask."
48,8,"So, after reading your article, the title just said ""Well, this guy is getting into a long road with a lot of people out there that doesn't agree with him."""
55,48,I was looking at the entire thread and it was pretty clear it was a joke. Apparently the first paragraph consists of a retort and it's an attempt at a funny - sexist -- response to a comment stating that the president is wearing a mask and not that he has a right to wear a mask.
66,48,CANNOTANSWER and RICHARD STIGNEY are the trolls in this movie.
70,48,>I am going to see the mask of the past and I am getting my own insurance.
72,48,Yes. I'd love to see this film. But it does not sound like it's relevant or interesting.
74,48,I am sorry if I’m confusing these posts. You have a lot of points that don’t fit the context of the post. Having to leave comments that are a little contradictory with the topic that you’re trying to make.
78,48,"It is a joke, but not a joke. I don't think the entire issue is a joke."
81,48,"I think you should be getting some clarification from a doctor. I see it's kind of like 'How does the president make money'. The doctor is a sex worker. If he wants a hat on, he will buy it himself."
84,48,I cried when I heard that.
91,48,"It was an interesting movie, not just the movie. This is a joke."
93,48,"I'm not saying it is wrong, I'm just saying I think that it's a very valid issue."
94,48,"I can think of a way to prevent people from having the virus. They are all inflamed by the virus, but it's not like it has anything to do with the virus. If it's getting more or less dangerous and there's other things going on, then I'd imagine it is more of a human issue than a public health issue. Unless you want to talk about it, you have to tell people that it is a government issue."
98,48,"It's a good read and it's a good read because it takes some thought to be considered a good read, as in not trying to make it into a serious conversation or any 'good' or ""informed discussion"". It's not one of those 'good' things, it's the ""ask the cops"" kind of stuff that's not even really about the topic."
48,6,Why does wearing a mask seem like a joke?
48,8,"I think the movie would fit right in with the CIA’s arguments. I feel like this is a good movie, but I don’t want to be a r&d person about that."
55,48,It's just a joke. I think you're right: It's a joke. That's not how AIDS works. There are actually more than one person that could be at fault for it. I can't believe people are actually a big fan of vaccines. I can't believe people are actually a big fan of vaccines. I can't believe people are actually a big fan of vaccines. I can't believe people are actually a big fan of vaccines. I can't believe people are actually a joke. It's a
66,48,"The author and I, in a lot of cases, are going against a very broad interpretation of the law. You should watch this movie in a way that doesn't have to do with any of these things. I feel like you should listen to this movie, but you should not listen to it."
70,48,It's not about the ACA. It's about reversing the ACA's symbiotic relations with other countries' governments.
72,48,CANNOTANSWER:
74,48,"A lot of the people in this sub are saying, ""Oh, I don't like it! You get sick from it! Do you think I don't think it's a prank?"""
78,48,The one thing I find really interesting about the ACA is that a majority of people do not want to learn about it when they realize that they do not want to know. I know that I know that the entire topic was about what was going on but a lot of people were confused by the joke.
81,48,"I was the last one on the show, and the sleazy guy was a real scumbag in every way, but that was before his presidency."
84,48,I am sorry that I am insensitive to the issues I'm writing about.
91,48,"This is pretty much the name of the whole sub, and essentially what they are trying to do."
93,48,"I agree with the first comment that it's a huge conspiracy theory that the government is wrong, but they are wrong."
94,48,"It's all about the NSA. The CIA doesn't have a whole lot to do with that. The NSA can be obnoxious, but they can't do anything about it."
98,48,It's not the only time to read the article. The article is about him being a hero.
48,6,This is a prank. It's a prank. It's a prank.
48,8,The sleazy guy was a real scumbag in every way.
55,48,"I don't know. I mean, it sounds like the President is a little worried because he's wearing a mask, but he's also taking a joke. I'm not sure what he wants to say, but that is his main point. I think the President is being an asshole, and he's trying to take away from that joke by trying to make himself appear as a shithole."
66,48,A few words for a troll:
70,48,'I'm not a doctor. I think this is the most interesting prank I've ever heard.'
72,48,CANNOTANSWER: People have no right to have a mask.
74,48,What's the moral of wearing a hat in the film?
78,48,"I don't know if the whole thing is a joke or not, but I've heard something like this before:"
81,48,">I've been talking to a sleazy guy, who always says, ""I am sorry that this happened to you."""
84,48,"This is exactly the kind of person I’d be willing to take a hit on, but that’s not how the actual ""decision"" process works."
91,48,They need to make sure they don't force him to wear a mask to prevent the spread of a virus. This is really how a guy gets his money.
93,48,"They're not talking about the ACA, they're talking about the Bush administration and the Obamacare bill."
94,48,"Why wouldn't the CIA ban the CIA for any reason? 'Can't they ban the CIA for other things?',"
98,48,"You're getting smacked on for saying this, and now you're being downvoted because you're being downvoted for saying this."
48,6,"CANNOTANSWER : The official answer is 'I wear my mask when I m in public lawmaker who isn't wearing his mask in public says'."" (http://www.ipc.gov/repair/repair/security/complaints/nasa_repair_lawyers-female_gov/)."
48,8,"I've always thought this was one of the only ""good"" parts of the AIDS epidemic."
55,48,I think the most important point is that the President should have been vaccinated to prevent the spread of the virus.
66,48,"It is ridiculous, it screams 'I'm not a doctor, I’m a doctor, I don’t want to be a troll'. It has nothing to do with the constitution, but it has to do with the ACA. And that’s a serious issue."
70,48,RA is very anti - HIV. I don't think she can be a doctor or a doctor.
72,48,"In my experience, a good candidate for president should be on the same page as a good candidate for President (and the first guy in the first) and you can't say, 'We have no right to have a mask' when speaking of the president and the President in general."
74,48,"I know a lot of people who don't get how the movie is about the government. What I'm telling you is that it's a prank about the government, not about the people that want to take care of it."
78,48,"I think the problem with this is that if we don't have a mask in the classroom, there's no chance we'll be able to make it a joke."

84,48,"Vaccination doesn't just stop the spread of a virus, it stops the spread of AIDS."
91,48,The implication of what they said is that this is a really big issue. And I can't believe people will be getting upset about this.
93,48,"There are no laws that aren't meant to stop HIV/AIDS, no vaccines, no drugs, no money, no money. I don't think I'd be comfortable with using a mask, or not having to pay to get one. This is just an excuse not to be a big fan of the ACA."
94,48,I think the worst part of this is that the government is trying to prevent the spread of the virus.
98,48,And the best way to do that is if you feel they have an awareness of it and you're willing to tell them the truth.
48,6,Why do you think the guy isn't wearing a mask?

70,48,"If it was a joke about the ACA, he was a dick and not a doctor."
72,48,"Considering that the whole thing is a satire of the government, I don't think there are any people who think it's wrong to wear a mask to prevent the spread of AIDS. The movie is based on facts, not the film, and it's a joke."
74,48,"Why are you getting such negative attention for just one day? The moral of the movie is that it's the movie that is in it, not that it's about the government. It's about how people think, which is why it's about the government."
78,48,"I'm in school now, and the kids are learning about HIV and the health care that the government provides them. I would have never been able to understand that they aren't in the school. It's just the way they get paid. And they probably know that the ACA doesn't address AIDS or the general public's problems."

91,48,The movie was interesting. I love the idea that the government is trying to stop the spread of a virus. What do you think is the real problem with these people? It's about his people being the real victims. I feel like there are so many people in the US and the world around us that they don't care.

It is about the US government trying to stop a deadly virus. It's based on a book written by a guy who did great work explaining the concept of the threat of the new superintelligence technology."
93,48,Why is this being downvoted?
94,48,"I don't know what the title is, but in this case, the first part is very relevant:"
98,48,Is there a reason the CDC won't let them have sex with the man or the guy not being a doctor? Its not like the CDC's position is about preventing the spread of AIDS.
48,6,Yes. The best thing I can think of is a prank called The Secret to the Conan O'Brien.
48,8,"I don't know, I know, the CDC's position is to fight for that. They're not allowing these individuals to take part in that fight, but to do so as to avoid any harm to their own. I think that if someone had gone through the sex tape and wasn't a prankster, he would have said that it's a joke and not a prank."
55,48,"The president is wearing a mask, and his head is being protected from a mask."
66,48,RIP Troll. I'm a troll.
70,48,"CANNOTANSWER: The article is about the president prankting on a young dude who's got a brain tumor and it is about the CDC. The movie is about a man who pranks himself, and wants to stop the spread of a virus."
72,48,"""... I am trying to figure out what's wrong with a movie. I think it is a good idea. The whole idea of a hat isn't a good idea. The whole idea that a hat is dangerous isn't a good idea."""
74,48,"I thought this was a good joke. I think it was just a prank about the ACA, I'm not sure why, but I didn't find it funny and didn't see the part about the CDC. It's a joke about the government. The ACA is not a joke, it's about the government."
78,48,"CANNOTANSWER: ""In the ACA, the president doesn't need a mask, but it does address the problem of AIDS."""
81,48,It's not a joke. It's a joke because a prankster is using a joke to avoid a joke.
84,48,"It is. It is a prank to stop the spread of the virus, not to prevent it."
91,48,'We're Wearing a Mask' is a satire of a satire.
93,48,It's a big topic. It's a huge topic. It's important to know that some people are trying to be opportunistic. I think they're doing good - but they don't want to believe it's the best idea ever.
94,48,I think the main idea is that we're trying to stop the spread of the virus because that's the main point of the article. I think we should give them some protections as well. Because the CIA is not involved with this nonsense. I think they should be able to take away and not prevent.
98,48,Basically everything on here is about the president's role as a politician in preventing the spread of HIV.
48,6,YES. This is one of those things you have to admit that gets diluted and confusing in a lot of the people that are reading.
48,8,"CANNOTANSWER: ""It is a joke because a prankster is using a joke to avoid a joke. It is. It is. It is a prank because a prankster is using a joke to avoid a joke. It is."
55,48,I don't think this is racist.
66,48,I think the author is trying to get the ACA to get rid of health care. The article doesn't say anything about the ACA or the anti-hysterectomy issue.
70,48,You have no rebuttals. I'll have to go back and read them again and again.
72,48,I've seen a lot of the above and I can't even make it to the end. I feel like it's all just a prank. But I am trying to figure out what's wrong with it. I'm trying to figure out what's wrong with the hat.
74,48,CANNOTANSWER FUCK YOUR HELL
78,48,This is really funny. You're telling the truth. The president didn't do the ACA. The ACA addresses the problem of AIDS. The ACA prevents the spread of AIDS. There is no way that anyone can get AIDS without wearing a mask. There is no way that any man can get AIDS without wearing a mask. There is no way that any man can get AIDS without wearing a mask. There is no way that any man can get AIDS without wearing a mask. There is no way that anyone can get AIDS without wearing a mask.
81,48,"Afda has also stated that if you don't understand what a hat joke is, don't wear it"
84,48,Vaccination is not an effective prank. It stops the spread of the virus. It is. It is an important way to prevent the spread of the virus. It is an important part of the vaccine.
91,48,"I feel like this one is about the threat of AIDS, and is more about the government trying to keep the 'right' side of the shit out of our country. Not necessarily a one-sided issue."
93,48,"I think the point is that there is a lot more to this than ""I want to protect a billion Americans from a government that is supposed to try to prevent their own health care costs."""
94,48,">They aren't going to make people look like NSA agents. If there isn't a job in the CIA, what does it matter?"
98,48,What about a man wearing a mask to stop a virus from spreading around the world?
48,6,''The Secret to the Conan O'Brien''' is about the president's role in preventing the spread of HIV. The ACA addresses the threat of AIDS. There is no way that anyone can get AIDS without wearing a mask. There is no way that anyone can get AIDS without wearing a mask. There is no way that anyone can get AIDS without wearing a mask. There is no way that anyone can get AIDS without wearing a mask. There is no way that anyone can get AIDS without wearing a mask.

There is no way that anyone can get AIDS without wearing a mask. There is no way that anyone can get AIDS without wearing a mask. There is no way that anyone can get AIDS without wearing a mask.
55,48,AIDS... what about the president putting the mask on as a way to save the innocent people's lives? The president was referring to the CDC - not the CDC - as an excuse to protect the health of people in the country.
66,48,It sounds like you're trying to find a better reason to read.
70,48,"He's being a tyrant, and he knows it."
72,48,I'm just trying to figure out why this is just a joke.
74,48,There are other things in this world that make people sick that don't have the chance to be cured.
78,48,So your idea of the ACA being the best joke ever a little overblown?
81,48,The president needs to see his doctor for a medical condition. AIDS can spread fast.
84,48,"A prank. But if the CDC doesn't get anything done in the context of what's going on, it's not the best way to prevent the spread of a disease."
91,48,"In this case, the president's stance on AIDS is also very conservative and the AIDS epidemic was not a major problem at the time. He also screamed at a minority of people that he hated."
93,48,The whole thing is misleading. It’s not about the ACA and what it was intended to do. It’s about the administration trying to repeal it.
94,48,[Not in a sentence but on a title](http://www.ipc.gov/repair/security/complaints/nasa_repair_lawyers-female_gov/)
98,48,"Yes, I agree. If it were me, I'd be more likely to get tested for HIV and a mask will be given to him, as it's more of a precaution. I'm also not sure that the CDC is going to take care of anyone."
48,6,A good person who has a hard time breathing if he hasn't been wearing a mask would not have a problem doing so.
48,8,"If a doctor has an ape bite and he isn't wearing a mask, he's probably not going to be successful."
55,48,So the issue is the President should wear a mask to protect himself to prevent the spread of HIV?
66,48,A bunch of trolls.
70,48,It is not a prank. It is a joke. It isn't a joke because it's intended to address the problem of AIDS. It is not a joke because it doesn't address the problem of AIDS. It isn't a joke because it doesn't address the problem of HIV.
72,48,CANNOTANSWER:
74,48,This isn't a prank. It's a joke. This is a joke.
78,48,What about the secret to the Conan O'Brien story? The movie is amazing. It's a really funny story.
81,48,I just wanted to say that I think the point of the joke is that it doesn't stop the spread of AIDS.
84,48,"""The CDC is trying to stop the spread of a virus. It's not an effective prank. Vaccination does not stop the spread of a virus. It is an important way to prevent the spread of the virus. It is. It is an important way to prevent the spread of a virus."
91,48,I think that the idea of wearing a mask is a ploy to avoid talking about a virus that has spread out so fast. The movie is a good example of what a satire of a satire is.
93,48,"It seems as though the article is trying to explain the truth and is misleading. This is a really interesting article. It's not a troll post. It's an article that's very interesting for people who haven't read the government, or aren't aware of it."
94,48,Is wearing a mask more important than a hood?
98,48,A CDC article that seems to make an article about a guy who was diagnosed with HIV is pretty much a case of a doctor being ill without a mask. This is a very bad idea.
48,6,It's very interesting. I hope you like it and that you enjoy it.
48,8,The CDC is supposed to be able to put out an anti-virus campaign.
55,48,This is just a joke about the health care system. Vaccination is a joke about an insurance system which isn't a healthcare system.
66,48,>I think the author of the book is in the middle of an argument that he is against the ACA. Clearly the author of the book doesn’t have a case for an ACA veto.
70,48,I think the NSA is trying to stop people from getting the virus.
72,48,'I see what a prank that is.'
74,48,"""Mole-ai is a good comedy movie"""
78,48,...that's how a joke works and a prank ain't a joke
81,48,I think the point of the joke is that you should stop trying to help OP out. I have a feeling he has some of the most powerful issues in politics but his comments are just making me more angry and he doesn't care enough to put them on his own side to explain them.
84,48,"We all have our reasons. I've never heard this guy speak about it, but the only thing I know about him is that he doesn't know what he's talking about."
91,48,So what are you saying in a satire about the government?
93,48,The topic of this article is the ACA repeal.
94,48,Is there anything that you think a government agent should be banned for?
98,48,"Vaccination is not a science and is a form of therapy. The drug does not have a cure. It is not necessary, and is inherently harmful, to the HIV/AIDS disease. This is because there is no cure, but there is no cure. This is not a cure. It is not cure. That is not the case."
48,6,I feel like you're not a troll. But I'm a good guy.
48,8,"“If there is an ACA repeal, they need to reintroduce it a few times before they can be effective in stopping it”."
55,48,The President is being a hoax. Vaccination and the ACA are the two main issues in that debate.
66,48,"It's very interesting, but a bit of an interesting book, not too far from a serious topic. It's like a prank."
70,48,"""I don't see how anyone could be in charge of a prank on a prank. It's not a joke. They're just trying to make it a joke. We are a prank. We're trying to protect a virus. We're trying to protect a virus. We're trying to stop a virus. I think that's how it goes. We have to do what's best. We don't need to fight the avengers, they need to make a joke. But then we need"

81,48,>A lot of the other posts seem to be about political satire.
84,48,I can't think of a better phrase for this one. I just want to remind you that it's part of a prank.
91,48,"I think the idea of him wearing a mask is more important than the actual problem that has been solved in the first place. It's a very similar idea, albeit with more complicated implications."
93,48,"CANNOTANSWER, the 'contract'to repeal Obamacare, is a troll post."
94,48,I'm not going to be one of those people who thinks that there should be a ban on a mask.
98,48,A lot of the ideas in the book are a little misleading. The premise of the'silly piece' that I'm referring to is a hunch the author has made a number of claims and the authors have backed it up a little.
48,6,“I think the best thing that can happen is a prank called “The Secret to the Conan O’Brien” (https://www.reddit.com/r/Memoirs/)
48,8,">A lot of the implication here is that the US government is not going to enforce anti-virus laws, and if so, he must do something if he wants to get more attention."
55,48,I don't think the ACA is a joke.
66,48,"The author of the book has written a book about the ACA. The author is saying ""Is there an article that the author is in the middle of an argument that he is against the ACA"""

78,48,It’s kind of a joke. That’s the thing. And the reason you think it’s funny is because it addresses the problem of AIDS. But it’s a joke because it addresses the problem of AIDS. The ACA is a joke because it addresses the problem of AIDS.
