90,75,yes the newest strain is soooooo contagious just bc they have a mask on their hands pics don t mean they re using it
75,2,I wouldn't go to a mask event.
75,5,"It isn't about mandates. It is about the vaccinated person with boosters, because he has the vaccine and it can help him protect himself from some of the risks he's posed."
75,6,The State Department has two mandates for vaccinating people with boosters.
75,11,Twitchcon and masks
75,14,Is it worth it? If it is I can t even go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask
75,17,I hate to say it but I don t know what I fucking hate to say.
75,28,I am not sure if that will be true but if you want to go to an event that requires you to wear a mask then the state has a mandate to have you in your pocket if you decide to wear a mask.
75,33,I will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask
75,34,"I just did an AMA and I was really baffled by the fact that I can not wear a mask, the people that are not in the country are making a point of it being illegal. It sounds like there are so many things that would be considered illegal to use a mask."
75,37,It is pretty cool to know if a state or city can impose restrictions on what you can wear to an event.
75,40,There s a bunch of folks here that are making the same claim - they have vaccines but are not allowed to wear a mask - and they aren t gonna get mad at the government for making a move that s not actually law or requiring you to wear a mask.
75,41,"You are the govt's president, isn't he?"
75,42,You have to wear your mask.
75,44,[Given the amount of people using this website (or shaming the government for their policies) it hasn't worked out yet:
75,47,I hate those people because they are fucked. I think that people like them are trying to protect us but unfortunately they can t keep up with the demand.
75,49,The government isn't the only government that isn't responsible for the spread of the virus.
75,51,"i like the sd bc of its own vaccine laws. they do not make it legal for people to wear a mask, even though it s just something people use to hide their shit."
75,55,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
75,56,What if the federal government banned all vaccinations in the states?
75,62,I don t know about Vermont but there is a lot of stuff that you can say about the Vermont Vaccination Act (WPA) and the Vaccine Act of 1972.
75,65,I want to buy the sd vaccinity vaccine on my phone to wear at a local vaccinity booth at a party i love and go to
75,66,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
80,75,i dont think i will catch the cough i already had it i m against them cuz they ruin the economy get people fired and people should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force
88,75,I was an adult vaccinated and had my boosters with me at Twitchcon for years a few years ago. Getting vaccines was never going to help unless they were deemed fit and at least somewhat supportive of the public health stance. The masks are so good that if I don t have one on I am going to be on guard for that very day.
90,75,i dont think you should be using a mask. the government is fucking using it. I think we need to get a proper policy on this
75,2,I don't understand why you wouldn't go to a mask event.
75,5,I had a blast going to Twitchcon for the first time!
75,6,I m going to say it but I don t know what I fucking hate to say. I am not sure if that will be true but if you want to go to an event that requires you to wear a mask then the state has a mandate to have you in your pocket if you decide to wear a mask.
75,11,"I think we need to get a proper policy on this. Vaccination is such a big deal, the government is so far away from it."
75,14,"Yeah, but a few people drew a line in the context of the video."
75,17,"I am a sd vaccination candidate for Vermont and I am against the government. I don't think they can prevent the spread of a virus, they just have to give you a mask."
75,28,I'm not even sure if that's a word. The masks were not required at twitchcon.
75,33,A lot of people on this website are making it so that you can't claim that you have to wear a mask.
75,34,This is a great thing to read.
75,37,There are so many things that would be considered illegal to use a mask.
75,40,Isn't a mask part of the mandate to help prevent spreading a virus?
75,41,Vaccines are a good way to keep your eyes open when you're vaccinated and you're not getting any ill effects unless you're fully vaccinated. They're better for your health than the govt's president.
75,42,"The state doesn't have any mandates, and most state health departments don't like to wear any."
75,44,I was vaccinated for 10 months and a bit of a flu - I stayed out of work for 2 years and then went to TwitchCon to get a vaccination. This is a massive mistake.
75,47,"There is a huge amount of propaganda about the government, including this one."
75,49,I feel the government is stealing the good people and helping them save people.
75,51,"Well, you have the right to go wherever you want and not go anywhere that requires you to wear a mask, but I also have the right to go if the gov't asks for your permission to wear a mask."
75,55,Is the government trying to get you to come wear a mask?
75,56,"The government wants a real solution to its own problems, and they are not willing to work hard on them."
75,62,I'm gonna get my mask on and just fuck with it.
75,65,"I would say: 'Oh my God, I can't go on that - I'll be late for the party'"
75,66,What is the reason to not wear a mask?
80,75,>Wow i already had it i already had it i m against them cuz they ruin the economy get people fired and people should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force
88,75,"I just like to think that the people I was talking about were going to wear a mask, and were making fun of me for bringing them."
90,75,So how the government spreads a virus.
75,2,This seems like a very good idea.
75,5,"I have never seen anyone wear a mask, because I grew up in a rural area with no vaccine, even from friends who are from a state in the midwest. I just want to tell you this is because I don't want to see a government person wear a mask because it will not help him. I just want to get a joke on that."
75,6,The state of Vermont has a mandate to give you a mask. That is a ridiculous amount of information.
75,11,"TIL that in Vermont, the government wants to stop the spread of a virus."
75,14,"If you want to learn more about Vermont, you're welcome to make your own comments."
75,17,A lot of people on this website are making it so that you can't claim that you have to wear a mask.
75,28,"People don't necessarily need a mask, they're just saying there's not enough time to get a vaccination."
75,33,[(Making it illegal to wear a mask)
75,34,I don't really think they have any specific mandates on that - just that you can't wear a mask.
75,37,I think that's what the government is trying to do. It's very likely that they are just trying to sway the people on this side of the political spectrum to a point of not having a proper response to that conversation. I don't think they have any idea what's going on in their minds.
75,40,I'm not sure how to tell the difference between a fake viral mask and the fake ones.
75,41,[Making a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Making a mask). Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
75,42,"I am a Vermonter so I don't see how this is a good idea, and I think that they have a lot of propaganda about the government."
75,44,I don't think people think that the government is going to be able to prevent spread of a virus.
75,47,"There is a huge amount of propaganda about the government, including this one."
75,49,What did you say? This is so much propaganda about the government.
75,51,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
75,55,If you are at TwitchCon you are not being vaccinated at all. I wouldn't want to attend because I'm against the government.
75,56,"The government fucked up, and they're going to keep doing whatever they can to stop the virus from spreading."
75,62,"Well you have the right to go wherever you want and not go anywhere that requires you to wear a mask, but you also have the right to go if the gov't asks for your permission to wear a mask."
75,65,I think it's more because they're not willing to work hard on them.
75,66,They need to be allowed to wear a mask.
80,75,This seems like the NSA is inefficient and unfriendly.
88,75,Vaccines are not an unavoidable part of the program. You can be more than a vaccination at a time and still be vaccinated.
90,75,"A little joke. I don't have a photo of the person I'm interviewing who had a viral infection and wore a mask, and the CDC is trying to save them from getting shot because of a mask in a public place. I'm really not sure if the person wearing the mask really understands how the government spreads a virus. Then again I don't know if a doctor or hospital is specifically authorized to prevent HIV or whether or not the ACA is mandated by law."
75,2,The CDC does not have mandates to prevent the spread of the virus. Vaccines are not an unavoidable part of the program.
75,5,This isn't an election issue.
75,6,"I'm a resident of Vermont so I don't see how this is a good idea, and I think they have a lot of propaganda about the government."
75,11,"I think that's the whole point of this website. It's more a campaign to scare the people who are against the government and the public who don't have a choice about where to put it. You know, at least in my opinion. I'm not sure I've ever seen that in my life."
75,14,>I don't really think they have any specific mandates on that - just that you can't wear a mask. I think that's what the government is trying to do.
75,17,I'm a Vermonter and I don't even know how to tell the difference between a fake viral mask and the fake one.
75,28,It's the government's responsibility to prevent the spread of the virus. They don't want people to be vaccinated if they don't want them to be vaccinated.
75,33,"As someone who lives in Connecticut, I can tell you that the government is being a bit of a jerk, they may not want to work hard to prevent the spread of a virus. They may also want to take steps to prevent the spread of HIV, if they are really really trying to stop the spread of the virus."
75,34,"I don't think we should ignore the fact that ""We need to be forced to wear a mask because we don't need to."" It's just what the government does. It's a propaganda thing."
75,37,"You're referring to the program used by CDC, and it's the anti-virus campaign. It's one of those campaigns that focuses on preventing the spread of HIV. And a lot of things do go against the plan."
75,40,I've heard of folks who rebranded their masks like that - they're called 'fake viral masks'. It sounds like people think they need to wear them but think they don't have to wear them. They say that they're in the swiss army. They don't even seem to realize that it's an actual virus.
75,41,I think you've misunderstood why this is the way it is.
75,42,"We're having a lot of good debate on whether or not this is true. It sounds like the people who will be at TwitchCon would be dissuaded from attending, but there is a really good chance that they wouldn't be able to heed the suggestion, and would be able to work with the people in charge, for the long term. Obviously a mask doesn't guarantee a future vaccination, and it's pretty unlikely that you'll be able to go for the next two years for years."
75,44,It seems like they're promoting falsehoods to support the government's attempts to get the government involved and to stop them.
75,47,>What did you say? This seems like the NSA is inefficient and unfriendly. Vaccines are not an unavoidable part of the program.
75,49,"If you do a CDC job, you need a mask."
75,51,Vaccines are not an unavoidable part of the program. You can be more than a vaccination at a time and still be vaccinated.
75,55,Is this a joke? It doesn't seem like the government is trying to get you to come wear a mask.
75,56,"This is a ridiculous question, but it has merit. What if the federal government wants a real solution to its own problems?"
75,62,I just read the comments on a newspaper a few days ago where I was attempting to explain how the government has a policy to avert the spread of viruses.
75,65,"A lot of people here are making it so that you can't claim that you have to wear a mask. People don't necessarily need a mask, they're just saying there's not enough time to get a vaccine."
75,66,It's funny how you make a 'Want to be a vaccinate'joke about the government's attempts to sway people into buying a mask.
80,75,"In some countries, you can get a'mock' and get a mask. In others it is not."
88,75,I don't think the whole reason I said you shouldn't do it was because I am not a vaccinated person.
90,75,"I'm actually not saying that it is a good idea but, I think we'll get some better policies by the end of this year. Having to buy masks is going to make people more concerned. But if you're not getting one, then you're gonna have a tough time."
75,2,Vaccines are an unavoidable part of the program.
75,5,"It’s not a real issue, but it is a big issue. And when we talk about healthcare it’s a lot more about the people on the mailing list who don’t want to get vaccinated."
75,6,I think that's what the NSA is trying to do with all the vaccinating stuff being done.
75,11,"I had to have it. I felt like a jerk for attempting to sway people into buying a mask because I didn't feel the need to, and it turned me away, but now I'm not going to be able to have a bad time."
75,14,"So when a reporter in Vermont calls this a joke, it's not true. You know, as someone in Connecticut who grew up in Vermont, you can be as depressed as you want to be. The government is actually promoting this behavior. You don't know the situation but you're likely not going to have a good time. It's not about the government, but about the federal government."
75,17,"I am sure some people might be surprised by the lack of a mask. In all honesty, I do like the fact that it's part of the program to prevent the spread of HIV, and that it helps them keep their heads above water."
75,28,"They're not really the government's responsibility, but they're part of the NSA's work to help prevent the spread of the virus. They are the people who can't change a government's policies by promoting the propaganda they have to convince people to get vaccinated and get one of them out of a job."
75,33,"CANNOTANSWER : The CDC are trying to make that shit illegal by making them illegal, which is misleading because they are promoting falsehoods that will help stop the spread of a virus."
75,34,"What would you do if you had to buy a mask from TwitchCon, and you weren't vaccinated? If you were not, what would you do if you weren't in the States?"
75,37,"My family is sick and it's a big deal that the government wants to do something about it, that it doesn't work as intended. There is a difference in what people would think. But it does. It's not like people would want to take a big risk of getting sick, even if they didn't need one."
75,40,"Yes. The NSA has tried to get people to use them, but the people who do not want to wear them aren't going to get vaccinated."
75,41,"A lot of people here are making it so that you can't claim that you need to wear a mask. I'm actually not saying that it is a good idea, but, I think we'll get some better policies by the end of this year. Having to buy masks is going to make people more concerned.

75,44,You said you wouldn't have a vaccine. I'm not going to be able to afford a mask at the moment.
75,47,"I'm not a CDC member, but I do know a few people who actually get the vaccine because they're in the CDC's anti-virus campaign, and that a mask doesn't guarantee a future vaccination."
75,49,"No, it's not that the government isn't responsible for the spread of the virus. It's that the government isn't doing anything to prevent the spread."
75,51,"I was talking about the NSA, not the vaccines. And the vaccines."
75,55,This isn't an issue for me. It's an issue for the people in charge who are not vaccinated.
75,56,It's been a while since I've been here.
75,62,I'm going to say this about twitchcon and masks you can hate me if the state town doesn't have any mandates you can't get mad that an event doesn't have any mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask.
75,65,I... Is a mask part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
75,66,"""Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
80,75,"I agree, the NSA is the only solution I've heard of. The NSA has never attempted to stop an epidemic of AIDS."
88,75,I'm trying to put a bit more of a personal note on this as I try to help you.
90,75,"i agree with your dad. I mean, the president and some of his allies should have no problem being in it. that's a great example of I hate to sound snarky but this movie is an excellent read"
75,2,I wouldn't go to a mask event. I would be willing to take a risk. I would be willing to take a risk. I'd also be willing to try to convince people to get vaccinated because of the lack of masks.
75,5,"'I think we'll get some better policies by the end of this year. Having to buy masks is going to make people more concerned. But if you're not getting one, then you are going to have a tough time.'"
75,6,"Yes, but there is no reason to assume that the CDC is responsible for the spreading of HIV."
75,11,"That would make me feel bad, but I'm not going to go to any of these events without getting vaccinated or ensuring a permanent cure."
75,14,"Is it not a big deal that the government is trying to make it illegal, which is misleading because they are promoting falsehoods that will help stop the spread of a virus."
75,17,"In this context, it's just a very small part of what is known about Vermont. The Obama administration doesn't want the government to be as responsible as it is."
75,28,> Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I am sure some people might be surprised by the lack of a mask.
75,33,This is a great example of I hate to sound snarky but this movie is an excellent read.
75,34,"> What would you do if you had to buy a mask from TwitchCon, and you weren't vaccinated? If you were not, what would you do if you weren't in the States?"
75,37,My wife and I went to a twitchcon in Wisconsin. We went through the CDC's anti-virus campaign and we didn't get vaccinated for a while. She asked if we could get some vaccines for this disease. We were given some in the CDC and they gave them away in return.
75,40,"The CDC has been at the heart of this whole thing, so they're just trying to make the issue not that big."
75,41,"It's been a while since I've been here. I have to say, and this is how I am feeling."
75,42,"It seems like you have never seen the movie The Simpsons but you have the same gist as him, I don't even know if it has the genus that they're referring to. I mean, the president and some of his allies should have no problem being in it."
75,44,if the CDC does that they will be looking into it.
75,47,"You seem to think the NSA is the only solution to stop AIDS, right?"
75,49,This is why the government keeps using 'war on drugs' as a counterpoint to AIDS. Having to use a mask is not enough to stop a large population from developing HIV.
75,51,Why isn't the CDC a part of the program to stop the spread of AIDS?
75,55,"CANNOTANSWER : The CDC are trying to make that shit illegal by making them illegal, which is misleading because they are promoting falsehoods that will help stop the spread of a virus. What would you do if you had to buy a mask from TwitchCon, and you weren't vaccinated?"
75,56,The whole movie is a bit skewed. It's just a good example of how we CAN'T get the government to do anything about the problem.
75,62,Vaccination & Vaccine is a very broad subject on the Internet. You're asking for a bit more depth on that subject - but not much of a general one.
75,65,I think the NSA should be able to prevent the spread of AIDS.
75,66,"I'm the president, and that's really all I have in mind when I read this."
80,75,Is there a difference between going to the CDC and being a CDC volunteer? I am not a CDC volunteer but I just got a job at the CDC. I had to walk the CDC to get a mask to work because they would show me what the program was. It was all about playing football.
88,75,I don't think you can do a lot of things that are stupid unless you're vaccinated. It sounds like you're not really vaccinated.
90,75,My mother has an old virus in her hand that is catching up to me. I’ve never heard of it and she sat at home with my father all day. That I still wear a mask is absolutely absurd.
75,2,Is that what the president and his allies are talking about here? Is this how the Bush administration is putting it?
75,5,Vaccination and vaccination are both important ways to deal with the problem and the CDC should take that as a very clear statement.
75,6,"The CDC, and the CDC are trying to stop the spread of AIDS and get a better deal with that, with some help from the president. They have already done some stuff, including a number of senate elections, but I'm not sure the govt is really doing anything besides protecting themselves and keeping all the vaccinated from HIV."
75,11,"A CDC mandate. In my opinion, you have to get a vaccine. There is no reason to not have a CDC mandate. The CDC is not helping you with this."
75,14,The government is also trying to get the government to do more to stop the spread of AIDS.

88,75,I think the actual problem is that people are actually getting vaccinated because they think they're the worst case scenario. The actual problem is that they are actually doing a very good job of preventing a problem like TB/STIs.
90,75,I really don't think this is a good example of how the Obama administration has dealt with the health care system.
75,2,This is a good question.

75,17,I'd like to add that you haven't spoken to any of these people on reddit about TB/STIs. I think you have been very thorough.
75,28,It's an example of how the Obama administration has dealt with the health care system.
75,33,"It seems like he's just getting started. This is how he said, ""At least we're not saying he's right, but the CDC's inaction is not in the best interest of us."""
75,34,The Obama administration should have known better than to try to get a different version of what the media has said.
75,37,I don't know how many of the other vaccinators are citing the ACA as an example of government retribution.
75,40,I think the actual problem is that people are actually getting vaccinated because they think they're the worst case scenario. The actual problem is that they are actually doing a very good job of preventing a problem like TB/STIs.
75,41,Why is it a government agency?
75,42,"I know I can be a bit harsh but I can understand why he will feel uncomfortable when he wears masks. They don't help the people, they help the disease. They're not a government entity and it's only a government agency. The CDC can do very little but it doesn't mean it is incompatible with the ACA. It means that you'll never be able to go."
75,44,Vaccines are an incredibly important and effective tool for preventing the spread of a virus.
75,47,Vaccines are an important and effective tool for preventing the spread of AIDS. The ACA is not an exception to the ACA. The CDC is not an exception to the ACA.
75,49,"I've also seen several of the other ACA cases, including the first. I read one where they call ""twitchcon and masks"" and say ""we aren't 'the only government that isn't responsible for the spread of a virus."""
75,51,I know that they should have put out an article in /r/news/snarkynews about this on a subreddit that discusses how the US reacted to this.
75,55,I'm not sure if I understand what you mean by that but I think the CDC is trying to make it illegal and misleading. I'm not sure what's going on here. It's actually an awful example of how the Obama administration has dealt with the health care system.
75,56,Vaccines are an important and effective tool to prevent the spread of AIDS. Vaccines are an essential tool. Vaccines are an important and effective tool for preventing the spread of AIDS.
75,62,">Refusing to wear a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.Is the ACA an exception to the ACA? The ACA is, in my opinion, an exception to the ACA, but is not an exception to the ACA."

75,66,"I'm a doctor, and have a lot of information for my doctor. I've never had a CDC ad, or had one. Vaccines are an essential part of the CDC's treatment for AIDS."
80,75,I think that people should be able to choose to wear a mask and take the jab. That's not a joke.
88,75,"I've had to say this before, but my mother does. My mom and my family smoked a lot during that time and we had a lot of time to spare to look after the sick people. When I told them, they said, You should not be vaccinated and don't be vaccinated. I also told them I needed to be vaccinated because I knew they didn't need to."
90,75,"I've been having a great time watching this book. I figured it would have been entertaining to listen to if the author did something that would make you think something like ""What are you doing today?"" It's really funny and a little sexist in the way that they're trying to portray people and get them to do what they want with their lives and get rid of the health care system. I don't like snarky things in the books."
75,2,I'd say it's more like a shitload of people who are having difficulty understanding how the government has got to their point of view.
75,5,"I don't get it, but I'm a doctor and I have been told for years that in order to prevent and spread viruses like AIDS it is illegal to wear a mask. It is only illegal for me if it is a medication, I can't wear one but I can buy one to help me get my vaccinated."
75,6,"I think a lot of this is about not vaccinating people, and also about how the CDC is trying to force people to be vaccinated. I think they have a problem with not knowing their policies or adherence to them, and they want to make it a policy of not allowing people to go on the basis that it is a way to protect their own health and to prevent the spread of the virus."
75,11,"This isn't a good example of government retribution, it's just a slap in the face."
75,14,I read a few of the other comments in this comment section.
75,17,The title of the book sounded like a fun movie. I thought the CDC was a party to the ACA. The CDC is a monopoly of the government. The Obama administration is a monopoly of the federal government.
75,28,>Refusing to wear a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
75,33,The US has been a terrible example of retribution.
75,34,I'd say the US CDC needs to learn about what's going on. They can't control how bad the virus can spread by vaccinating.
75,37,What a little bit of snarky talk.
75,40,"The CDC is going to rename these things ""necessary"". They are calling them ""fake masks."""
75,41,Vaccines are important in protecting people against infectious diseases. I think it's an important thing to be vaccinated but that's why people want to know if they need vaccinated. That's why people want to know if it's legal to not have a mask on and I think they want to know if there's a chance the vaccine is the right one.
75,42,There are two of these scenarios.
75,44,The CDC has no say in what they do.
75,47,This is the whole point of the Obama Administration.
75,49,The CDC isn't being fair or even fair in some cases. The CDC is a government agency. They are being unfair.
75,51,"I have a friend who is allergic to AIDS, so it's funny that the author has a bad job of explaining why the ACA is not an exception to the ACA."
75,55,It is a joke about a government agency trying to get people to buy a mask. It is also misleading because it is misleading that people are a part of the CDC's promoting falsehoods that will help stop the spread of AIDS.
75,56,"If they do, they'll be trying to take the peoples privacy off of you."
75,62,"It isn't an exception, it is a government exception. I don't think it has anything to do with the ACA, if the ACA was just a veto, I think it should be applied in a way that does not violate any law, if it is something that is wrong in the constitution."
75,65,"""The problem isn't that the CDC isn't involved in this, but that the government isn't actually the one who's making that decision."""
75,66,"I've heard that ""Better than the ACA"" is the opposite of ""I don't really believe in the ACA."""
80,75,I've actually come across this phrase before in my work with our state's health department as a result of a virus infection.
88,75,If you really hate the whole “I would probably be getting sick” sarcasm you're going to have to do things and not do them.
90,75,I think it's great that they're bringing to light their very good point that they can't get rid of this.
75,2,This is not what the ACA is about. The CDC is a monopoly on government.
75,5,This is how you write a response based on a comment - it's not a joke - it's a really funny title.
75,6,I'm trying to put a different spin on it.
75,11,"I don't think there is much you can do about that, but I think there is more to the story. A lot of it is just sarcasm."
75,14,"I can't imagine the government is promoting a joke in terms of AIDS vaccines and vaccinations. But then again, the ACA was passed in 2008 and you don't owe the people the responsibility for this."
75,17,"I know what you mean, but the CDC is the monopoly of the federal government, so why not?"
75,28,That's the part where I thought the CDC was a party to the ACA. The CDC is a monopoly of the government.
75,33,"It's the CDC that is making it illegal to go to the AIDS Convention and prevent the spread of this illness, not the CDC. They're trying to make it illegal."
75,34,Vaccines are an important and effective tool for preventing the spread of a virus.
75,37,They are trying to change a lot of the laws on what they do and are not doing anything about it.

75,41,"I listened to my friend's comments before posting, and I thought it was hilarious to read a paragraph where the author of the article had a similar opinion to mysql's."
75,42,"I mean, if the President was just a puppet sailor."
75,44,Why did the Obama administration have the rights to vote on this?
75,47,There's another interesting point that I was wondering about: what is the issue here? I'm pretty sure this is the most snarky example of government propaganda you have seen a few times.
75,49,I would love to hear more about this and it's the CDC. I love how the CDC is getting the word out and then trying to rewrite a book about the ACA.
75,51,"What about getting your nose sucked by people who are allergic to AIDS, too?"
75,55,"So when I read the title, my brain thought ""What the fuck is the Obama administration trying to do with the healthcare system?""."
75,56,They need to get rid of this by a law that carries a mandate. The law carries a mandate requiring people to wear a mask to prevent infection. And a mandate requiring people to be covered with a mask is a monopoly that the government is a party to.
75,62,[Victoria is an extremely broad topic. We need to understand what the ACA is. The CDC is a monopoly of the government. The Obama Administration is a monopoly of the federal government.

75,5,And the CDC a monopoly of the government.
