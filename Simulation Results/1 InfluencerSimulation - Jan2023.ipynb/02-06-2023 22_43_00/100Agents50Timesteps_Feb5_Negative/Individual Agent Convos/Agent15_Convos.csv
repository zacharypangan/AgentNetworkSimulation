70,15,if you wear a mask outside or in your car alone your gullible and submissive not traits you want to project
78,15,two tri county health dept board members from douglas county voted against the mask public health order and one did not vote due to affiliation to a school
88,15,i m going to say this about twitchcon and masks you can hate me if the state town doesn t have an mandates you can t get mad that an event doesn t not sure if sd has any mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask
89,15,putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i ve ever done in my entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things
90,15,yes the newest strain is soooooo contagious just bc they have a mask on their hands pics don t mean they re using it
91,15,two tri county health dept board members from douglas county voted against the mask public health order and one did not vote due to affiliation to a school
100,15,oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that
17,15,If you have a case of that it has to be a Vaccination. There is no reason to be an eagle and wear a mask unless you want to get vaccinated.
41,15,> i cant get mad that an event doesn t have an mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops
47,15,I'm a male... I wear a mask. I'm a male...
69,15,I have a very difficult time breathing without wearing a mask
70,15,... is this the same girl who was able to stop the spread of a virus.
78,15,"A student from another city asked for the mask to wear after school to prevent the spread of a virus and it's an arbitrary vote. The answer was ""NAME"""
88,15,I would be mad at all the masks being on when I am being vaccinated. I think people with boosters and the like are most likely vaccinated. It is a sign that things in the state aren't safe for you.
89,15,You seem to have done a lot of dumb things..
90,15,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
91,15,That isn't a bad thing. This isn't a new idea.
100,15,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that
17,15,I've been working for Donald Trump for about three years. He is already in his 20s and in his 40s. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
41,15,"It's been done. I threw a party bus around a lincoln field when I was in high school, and all the people I saw didn't have a job because I was vaccinated. It was a very funny incident."
47,15,i like wearing the masks and being able to see what is going on in my neck
69,15,What about the mask for a gun that protects you from the virus?
70,15,A government employee allegedly has a mask in her car for protection against the spread of a virus.
78,15,"This is not a prank, this is a public health matter and the public health law is about preventing the spread of a virus."
88,15,Vaccines are not an ideal way of stopping the spread of viruses.
89,15,I think you should have read his rant in the context of the tense.
90,15,"They should use a mask as a mask. In the United States, it doesn't work like a mask."
91,15,He lied to a board member and they were forced to vote against the new health order.
100,15,Oh no. You do not like wearing a mask because you have a hard time breathing and you want to talk about the same thing.
17,15,There is a documentary on Rogs of the Past starring Richard Branson.
41,15,The question is why does it need to be called 'the doctor'?
47,15,"If you want the country to go to war, you need to wear a mask. The only way to stop it is to try to bring it back."
69,15,>Is wearing a mask part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
70,15,[Rogers of the Past](http://relationships.dailystarships.org/emotional_projection/drama-the-porn-shelf) where a woman wears a mask outside or in her car alone her gullible and submissive not traits you want to project
78,15,This is why I feel it's very important for people to get to know the facts.
88,15,>When I was walking on a restaraunt and then taking it off when I got to my table is one of the dumbest things things I've done in my entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things Putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things I've done in my entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things Putting on a mask
89,15,Wearing a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking off the mask when you get to your table is one of the dumbest things things i've done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask
90,15,"So, there's a big difference between wearing a mask and actually not wearing one."
91,15,op's not a good read. He lied to a board member and they were forced to vote against the new health order.
100,15,It sounds like people are trying to help their sick friends and they are attempting to give them something to talk about. It's just this is how people react to these people in situations that are naive and pathetic. They feel like they're a bad person for not knowing what's going on. They want to be more able to talk to others.
17,15,"I think I've seen that movie a couple of times, and I'm glad I didn't read it wrong because it's an excellent read."
41,15,When did this incident happen? I'm in a state where you can't have the choice. There is a really good government that has put on a lot of masks. They're the best thing you could do to help a person. I think the fact that it's not a requirement to go to a doctor to get tested for a virus is a red flag.
47,15,"[Wiping a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I don't want to say a joke, but this is a ridiculous one. It seems like the board is too busy announcing what is being done to stop the spread of the virus."
69,15,"It's not just the president, it's the entire population."
70,15,"I'm gonna look up a movie about the government, I can tell you that a bunch of people like it."
78,15,This is the sort of stuff that everyone has to do with people in their daily lives.
88,15,"We're just putting in a little shit there, I've never seen a guy walk on a restaraunt before and never gotten a single infection in him. It's a great idea. I would say I have been there in the past."
89,15,It is a joke. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
90,15,"This is a bit confusing. You mentioned the ACA, not the ACA, but rather the ACA."
91,15,"As someone who recently came to talk about Trump and his mask, I can say it's a pretty stupid decision, and I like the idea of wearing a mask. He's wearing a mask to prevent his opponents from getting a cold. That's what he said when he said 'We want order in america' and it's a great idea."
100,15,"OP: ""What did you do to help yourself?"""
17,15,"There's also a documentary on ""Rogs of the Past"" that stars Richard Branson. It's pretty good."
41,15,"In this case, he is assuming that his doctors will be doing a better job if you are vaccinated, he is incorrect. He is also wrong that he is not eligible for the Medicaid program and has no reason to apply for it because of the ACA."
47,15,"A CDC is going to put up a new report on the vaccine issue on the basis that people are being forced to wear masks to get vaccinated, but when they don't, they end up going to jail for the entire month. The only thing that will keep them from getting sick is that a new report will put up some kind of bullet in the back of the mouth and if they do, they will start spreading the virus. They have a list to help with getting it tested and tested, but it's in the back of the head."
69,15,The joke is that the government will help to prevent the spread of viruses from coming into the country and making it impossible to stop them.
70,15,"i do not believe there are any laws or anything involving this thing that it isn't an issue. that is a prank. but, it's pretty easy to get slapped for it. I've seen a few, and it has no impact on my life."
78,15,The ACA's mandate on preventing transmission of HIV/AIDS is a joke.
88,15,"It's just a little bit silly to think that the government has a good interest in preventing transmission. They say they are not putting in the necessary safety measures to stop the spread of a virus. They are, after all, trying to cover up the problem."
89,15,"What do you think people are saying about this? Doesn't this make you a dumbass? I don't believe in the movie, but the movie makes me question what it means to be able to wear a mask when a person is wearing a mask."
90,15,"I think it's a great example of I hate to sound snarky, but this movie is an excellent read and I highly recommend it."
91,15,">He lied to a board member and they were forced to vote against the new health order.'Twas a shame he wore a mask and no school in the county I live in, one of the school board members didn't participate >"
100,15,"I'm just reading this so I can understand why you're being a dick. What I'm thinking is that when you get sick your brain will respond to the diagnosis. It's not like your body can't heal itself, it's a virus. There's no way to tell that. You're just telling your brain that you don't care and you're trying to talk to someone who isn't sure how to behave and how to live their lives. You're simply telling them that this doesn't work. That's how people react to"
17,15,"I'm also a lawyer. I was a lawyer for a big corporation, and they were both hysterical."
41,15,You are being totally obtuse.
47,15,I thought it was the other way around.
69,15,"You are absolutely right. There are very, very few public health issues. Mostly the health and well being issues, not just the AIDS ones. And then you have the fact that the virus spreads far, far more than the vaccine, and that you have to take a medical course on it."
70,15,A lot of the stuff in this video is very funny.
78,15,The ACA is a joke because the public health law abolitionists don't think they're entitled to be held responsible for their own lack of awareness of the problem.
88,15,"I like the joke that masks are ""the way"" and I can't believe they're on the TV."
89,15,That's kind of dumb as well.
90,15,"It's a big example of how the government should be more of a liar, and not necessarily a good example of how the ACA is getting twisted in a ridiculous way."
91,15,I didn't think a school did anything. I'm really not a liberal but I have no idea what a mask is. You can tell that the school didn't see this at all.
100,15,I'm going to go with this.
17,15,This is an excellent question. Is it illegal to use your body to get the AIDS vaccine?
41,15,"It seems that if you put on a mask and have a good chance of being vaccinated, you will be able to become a coach. But if you are the president and want to be in the president senate, then you should make it a law."
47,15,"The first answer is ""I'm not a prank at all. You seem to think the NSA is the only solution to stop AIDS, right?"""
69,15,Are you sure you're right? The CDC is not a CIA agent. The fact that the mask is used by a US government is the most likely explanation for the issue that the article was about.
70,15,"Is it an advertisement for the new movie called ""The Mask of the Past""?"
78,15,Is wearing a mask the answer to a prank?
88,15,"The joke is that they are in the minority, and that they have been working with people to help stop the spread of viruses."
89,15,"""It is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.So you've been in the US for a long time. I really like this movie because it is funny, funny and explains why the government is really trying to make people sick. I think that's one of the biggest problems that Americans have with all the stuff that makes us ill."
90,15,I just read a few words from a commenter that was just trying to explain this.
91,15,"I think it would be a pretty stupid decision for a school board member to put on a mask when they want to be seen in public. It would be a bad idea to put on a mask if a school was in the same building as him, he would probably be called out for not doing something about it. I don't like that idea of a politician wearing a mask - that's like saying he doesn't want to get arrested - but if he does it to keep a fucking fucking job, you have"
100,15,It seems that the guy is trying to be a good friend by referring to him as a sex addict. I think it's time to start thinking more critically.
17,15,">We need more people like Trump, so people don't take on the role of the president and i mean even if it is not possible to prevent any new violence. he would have been the greatest president ever."
41,15,"You don't really need a mask to be a coach if you have one in your home. If you don't have one in your home, you're being a joke."
47,15,The best way to stop AIDS is to do everything you can to stop it. I would go with the ACA. It's not a prank. It's a public health initiative.
69,15,I'm not sure what he's referring to. But... this sounds like a really good idea.
70,15,"I'm gonna go see a documentary about a guy wearing a mask and what he's talking about. I don't know what else to write about that, but it sounds pretty interesting."
78,15,">The actual problem is how many people wear masks, and when it happens, they die. Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks. The whole idea of a hammer blazing all over your face is a little silly. But in order to keep things interesting, you have to keep some things in mind that are a bit of a 'bad' time."
88,15,">The actual problem is how many people wear masks, and when it happens, they die. Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks."
89,15,I think this is why a lot of people have not seen it.
90,15,"CANNOTANSWER: ""I love that the movie is a great book. I love that satire of the government."""
91,15,I would say that they're making a pretty stupid decision. He's wearing a mask to prevent the spread of the virus.
100,15,"The problem is not just him, but a lot of people with AIDS."
17,15,"""There is no reason to be an eagle and wear a mask unless you want to get vaccinated. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus."""
41,15,It's not a joke. It's an excuse for the health care industry to be censored.
47,15,I'm a little confused and I see you are not sure what a mask is.
69,15,"In the current US Congress, the President is going to have to take a public health course on the CDC vaccines, and he has to tell the president that the CDC isn't working on the vaccine. This is going to be a prank in the Senate and House."
70,15,"That's a really, really good one. I don't see any pranks here at all. There's so many of them, I think there's at least one sarcastic comment going around."
78,15,Because the ACA is a prank.
88,15,">I wouldn't do that if my husband didn't vaccinated him,"
89,15,"So your definition of a sarcastic joke is, ""How stupid did you think I'd say this?"" I think it sounds like you are the guy who wrote it."
90,15,"I've read the full article, but the only one stating why it is such a good book."
91,15,"I'm not sure what to say. The article just seems to say that a public health order, while not a big deal to people, is actually an issue. It might not seem like the only possible solution to the current threat, but he is wearing a mask to prevent the spread of the virus."
100,15,"AIDS sufferers are not being able to talk to anyone and anyone with it. That is a dangerous and extremely dangerous disease, not one that needs to be treated, nor cured, by anyone. In many cases, people who are not able to tell the difference between being able to talk and being able to talk aren't able to talk to them."
17,15,I don't like this shit.
41,15,"I think it's an idea that's been around for a long time, and it's not about being a troll. The Obama administration is a dick shaped mask, but it's the problem of having people in public space who need a mask."
47,15,"Well..........I’m not the dr./woman, but I'd get a sick pill and get the vaccinated, since I work as a lawyer. I’d do it all the time."
69,15,What? There are many reasons why a lot of doctors and physicians think it's a prank.
70,15,I am not a lawyer but I do work in the CDC. They make a lot of funny pranks about being on the team and playing on the internet. They're not supposed to save lives.
78,15,"I've heard people say that the worst thing to do is get an infection. But when they say, ""The best way to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS is to make your body use a mask."" I'm not sure what their point is, but I know that it makes the real ACA look a little like a joke to me. It is a joke that everyone is willing to prank."
88,15,"The problem is that people are going to see the virus as a harmless infection, which the CDC can't prevent or prevent."
89,15,What's the point of a sarcastic joke if someone says this?
90,15,Then he's a racist.
91,15,"Yes, this is what the first part of this is about."
100,15,"'Oh you dont like wearing a mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that', 'Oh no. You do not like wearing a mask because you have a hard time breathing and you want to talk about the same thing.''"
17,15,"It's just a joke. I don't like it. It's a good thing that you’re able to get the facts straight, and your comment is on a subject of a different kind. I don't like it. It’s a good thing that you’re able to get the facts straight, and your comment is on a subject of a different kind."
41,15,Is a mask an excuse for the health care industry to be censored? It doesn't sound like a joke.
47,15,Because the president is a tyrant who wants to get rid of any form of health care.
69,15,CANNOTANSWER: So he's using a mask to protect himself? Or something? A guy with an eye in his thirties is trying to get the US to stop wearing a mask. The ACA doesn't matter if you're a doctor if they wear a mask.
70,15,A lot of people think that the NSA is funny. I think the most cliche pranks are like the people who want to cut the government off.
78,15,"As someone who was very well aware of the ""Potentially Anti-Asia Act"" for the first time in 30 years, I can confirm the truth. I'm in the process of thinking back to the previous episode."
88,15,It is also the CDC that is talking to people.
89,15,I’m going to be an author.
90,15,OP's father isn't really a doctor.
91,15,"In the first movie, I was gonna say something about the people who don't know who the actual president is, and what he's supposedly talking about."
100,15,"Wearing a mask doesn't mean anything. The stigma of wearing a mask is not so far removed as it might seem. You can be a good friend, if you don't give it a try, because you'll have to suffer the stigma of not feeling secure or caring for yourself."
17,15,I think this would be a sexist comment.
41,15,"""This is a joke. The idea of wearing a mask is sexist and inappropriate. The NSA are using the AIDS virus as an excuse to use it. They are making a film about it so they can avoid it."
47,15,"I know it's hard, but you sound really naive. I think it's good that he tries."
69,15,A man is trying to get the US to stop wearing a mask. The ACA doesn't matter if you're a doctor if they wear a mask.
70,15,The mask is a bit funny.
78,15,"I don't think a mask is the answer to a joke. It's a joke that everyone is willing to prank. Especially because of the fact that a hammer blazing all over your face is funny, and that it's also a joke because that's not the same as a prank."
88,15,"So you're not actually talking about AIDS, or anything else but that you're saying that vaccination is the best way to stop spread of AIDS?"
89,15,"There's a great thread on youtube with some good ideas about the word ""hammer"" and it isn't sarcastic. It's not a joke. It's a dick joke because it doesn't make sense in a good way."
90,15,I have a copy of that movie and I'm not a huge fan of it.
91,15,'You can tell that the school didn't see this at all.'
100,15,"People who aren't comfortable using masks to tell if someone's not well,'sex addicts','sex addicts' and 'addicted' with AIDS are the same kind of people with AIDS that are not even able to tell if they have a hard time breathing?"
17,15,"Honestly, when the CIA is working on the virus, it's a lot more efficient to use their resources and to just prevent people from being able to actually get the virus without being able to go to the doctor."
41,15,> I don't think I've ever seen an ACA policy that states you are not allowed to wear a mask. I wore a mask for my mom.
47,15,"I am very sorry to say, but I don't know what a prank or prank is."
69,15,"They can't just have the President's face off with the whole white house. 'It's not only the CDC, it's the entire population, and the fact that the government hasn't worked on a vaccine will make people feel better.'"
70,15,A lot of people think that the NSA is funny. I think the most cliche pranks are like the people who want to cut the government off.
78,15,"The only way you can prevent TB/STIs is to get a mask. The only way is to use a mask unless you are sick — and if you do, you can have a cold and a fever, and not be sick because you are being sick."
88,15,Vaccines are the best way to stop the spread of a virus.
89,15,"It's a joke, but it's not really the point of a sarcastic joke. It's a dick joke because it doesn't make sense in a good way."
90,15,"> I can't help but read the book and it seems to me that this is a satire of the book. It's not about getting a mask on you, it's about being a narcissistic troll. I want to get a mask on the girl."""
91,15,That he's wearing a mask to prevent the spread of the virus is a terrible idea. I don't think people are going to have much interest in the subject. It's not something you could say.
100,15,"So, he doesn't want to have sex with someone who doesn't understand how it works?"
17,15,"It's not just a joke, it's a fact, a fact. You just fucking have to think it out like that, because it's a valid point."
41,15,"It was a funny incident, but I don't think you will get mad if you see them as the president."
47,15,There are literally hundreds of people who need to get vaccinated.
69,15,"I am not aware of any of these things. I am familiar with some of the infamous sarcasm in the comments, and I am not sure how the CIA is trying to help a president by making him wear a mask. It is likely that he is lying to the president about his intentions, but I will try to explain them to you."
70,15,"RA was a sexist prick. If you can't tell, the shit is a prank and that's your fault. This isn't a joke, a joke, and I'd not take it. The NSA isn't trying to stop the spread of AIDS. It's working hard to stop a virus and not even stop it. The NSA can have a hard time believing that the prank is a joke. The fact that the CIA can have a hard time believing that the prank"
78,15,"i thought that wearing a mask was a joke and the ACA was a joke,"
88,15,"And the CDC – despite not putting in the necessary safety measures – is basically trying to cover the problem by attempting to push a big campaign to the effect of preventing transmission. AIDS is a very serious problem, and it is not a joke."
89,15,I listened to the movie and it is one of the best movies of all time. The story is that people are walking through restaraunts and the movie is about how the government is trying to stop the spread of a virus.
90,15,I don't believe it.
91,15,I'd be interested in what is being said but I'm afraid it's a fairly small subreddit.
100,15,That is the way AIDS is treated.
17,15,It's a joke. Vaccines are the best way to stop the spread of a virus. Please wear masks.
41,15,"> ""The issue is, that the president is the one who actually needs to talk about the ACA. Vaccine mandates aren't required by law in the USA. The article is pretty much what the article was about. Vaccine mandates aren't required by law in the USA. The article is pretty much what the article was about."
47,15,"It's a joke that's supposed to make people sick. I'd get a sick pill, get the vaccinated, go to a doctor, and have my AIDS tested. I would get sick. I didn't know it was that important."
69,15,This seems like a very interesting post. I wonder if people are aware of the truth or if they can get away with it. I would say it's hilarious that a bunch of satirical people are attempting to use this post to bring up a similar issue in the r/politics sub.
70,15,"'I am not a lawyer but I do work in the CDC. They make a lot of funny pranks about being on the team and playing on the internet. They're not supposed to save lives."""
78,15,The best way to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS is to wear a mask and get vaccinated. This is a prank and the government is trying to fix it.
88,15,"I am going to say that this is the first sarcasm I've ever heard. I want to go to a movie, but I cannot."
89,15,"I think what you're getting at here is that these people are doing things to make themselves look stupid or ugly. Like, it's an idea, a prank."
90,15,"""I like how you don't see how the movie is satirizing the ACA. The main problem isn't the mask, it's the government."""
91,15,"What is this thing called? It is not an official topic, it is a legal question. It's a government thing to be held against, it's a political thing. If you think it is necessary to prevent the spread of a virus then you don't read the article."
100,15,"""I think it's time to start thinking more critically."""
17,15,"Vaccines are not a crime, and people who wear masks aren't allowed to do it. It's only the government that has the power to make it illegal."
41,15,"That's the whole point of the movie. If he were a president, he would have a shitload of power."
47,15,"I've been asked all those questions, but you aren't correct in a lot of them. "
69,15,"There is a lot of misinformation in the comments, but not that many in real life."
70,15,"I have no idea what the joke about the NSA is, but it's pretty much the same as a prank if you're into politics."
78,15,"This is so funny because you're wearing a mask. You don't actually understand how people are trying to justify a joke. The ACA isn't a prank because it's a joke and the government is trying to fix it. You're saying that the answer is ""The ACA isn't a joke"" if you read the article, you're thinking of this as ""The ACA is a joke because it's only used to stop the spread of a virus."

100,15,The fact that he's trying to make a point that he has been using a mask to try to cure a symptom of AIDS is a symptom of mental illness.

So it will not only cause people to become infected but also prevent other diseases from getting infected with HIV/AIDS."
91,15,I love the idea that the government is trying to stop the spread of the virus. He's a horrible president but a very interesting guy who's just not ready to be a jerk.

91,15,He's wearing a mask because he believes his campaign promises are sexist and immature. I don't see a problem here.

17,15,What do you think of Trump’s policy on putting on a mask to stop AIDS?
41,15,I’m a lawyer.
47,15,Obama's not going to stop the spread of HIV. His is going to prevent people from getting sick. It's a joke.

70,15,You guys are trying to get you to stop being a joke and not get slapped?
78,15,I am so sorry I read this.
88,15,I hate if I tell you that. But they're a way of keeping you from identifying with an illness that is not in your control. They are using the vaccine as a vaccine to prevent an infection. That's their right. But they can't.
89,15,"So, [The hat is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. Why is it a prank?

91,15,"I don't get it. But I don't think the ""I'm just a man of my word."" quote is a bit like saying: ""My name is Bernie Sanders and my parents are Democrats, I am Jewish, I am not white"""
100,15,I've read a few times:
17,15,"It is a joke, and it's the government that has the power to make it illegal."
41,15,It would be nice if the CDC and the CDC did an interview where they're not the NSA who are responsible for the health care and are trying to pass a law to prevent it.
47,15,"I thought that the ""ask me how to stop the spread of AIDS"" thing was a joke."
69,15,It was a good book and a good one.
70,15,[NAME]: [NAME]
78,15,"So the President, at some point, would be willing to make the ACA a joke in order to avoid a public health disaster."
88,15,I'd never watch that movie if my parents had mandates to wear a mask.
89,15,The movie was a spoof of the movie. A prank.
90,15,It's about the president and not the people on the ground. And the movie is about the president.
91,15,"""In the first movie, I was gonna say something about the people who don't know who the actual president is, and what he's supposedly talking about."", ""I'm really not a liberal but I have no idea what a mask is."", ""But I don't think it's possible that a lot of people don't have the patience or the desire to understand this."
100,15,if you aren't able to tell if someone is getting it you are still sick. You aren't going to know what he is suffering from.
17,15,"It's a joke, and the government has the power to make it illegal."
41,15,You say the whole article doesn't mention the ACA itself. It says the president is the one who actually needs to talk about it.
47,15,This is the type of thing I don't care about. I don't understand how it is a joke.
69,15,I'm gonna say the 'Attitude' hat is a good book and a good one.
70,15,It seems like this subreddit is all based off the same books about a disease. It's intended to address the problem of HIV and the fact that it's a joke.
78,15,The answer is a joke. The joke would be a joke that a lot of people don't understand.
88,15,"In the first half of the movie, the CDC called them ""unconstitutional"" and asked for the people to wear masks. The CDC responded with ""no,"" ""yet again"". Then the other half asked about the CDC, and the president did a great job explaining this to the audience."
89,15,As a guy who has been in the military I can say I think this movie is pretty satirical and I think the whole sarcastic stuff is pretty hilarious.
90,15,I'm an American citizen with AIDS and am in the US.
91,15,I think you don't understand what the point of the movie is.
100,15,The shit post from the same subreddit is a troll. It's not because the post is interpreted poorly or misunderstood. It's that this man is trying to help people and is a troll.
17,15,It sounds like he is taking the word fad out of his mouth.
41,15,I'm a lawyer. I've been in the ACA.
47,15,The question is whether the president is a tyrant who wants to get rid of any form of health care?
69,15,"The article is written by an alleged US military expert, based on his personal experience in healthcare."
70,15,"I just want to say, I like this movie, I really like it."
78,15,I don't understand why the Obama ACA is the worst prank. It's the CDC trying to solve the problem.
88,15,"The CDC is doing the correct thing and they have a clear interest in getting a vaccine. You do want to avoid it, but the CDC is doing the wrong thing. You need to have a conversation with the people who are affected."
89,15,This is a pretty obvious example of how the government is trying to prevent the spread of a virus.
90,15,This isn't a good example of how the government treats all Americans.
91,15,i have a feeling these people are really being smug. and are being raped and killed.
100,15,"People with AIDS are not allowed to wear a mask, because it is a symptom of mental illness."
17,15,People who wear masks are not allowed to do it. People who wear them aren't allowed to do it. It's the government that has the power to make it illegal.
41,15,I was in the ACA and my husband and I got the meds. Then the CDC and CDC were trying to prevent the spread of HIV. It was a prank and it would never happen again.
47,15,"The government is the worst. It seems they are going to put up the NSA to make it all a joke, but no, it's not a joke."
69,15,"I've done things I'm never going to do, but I am a doctor. I am a doctor. I am a doctor."
70,15,"I would not want to get slapped. The truth is, you will be slapped because the NSA isn't working to tackle the problem of HIV. It's not a joke."
78,15,"I'm so sorry, but the answer is:"
88,15,"If there isn't a mandate, the fact that it's on the TV is a big slur."
89,15,Is it a prank? Yes. It is.
90,15,The author is basically trying to slap the government with an insincere warning and a rebuke that would hurt his campaign as well as the ACA. The only reason that he was making fun of the ACA was that he was trying to change the system.
91,15,"if you don't get a good book on this movie, you can read the other book about it. It's about an idea that was developed to help stop the spread of the virus in the world but that just doesn't sound very rational and would be a good book."
100,15,It sounds like the man is trying to be a good friend by referring to him as a sex addict. I think it's time to start thinking more critically. It seems that the guy is trying to help his friends with AIDS. It sounds like people are trying to help their sick friends and they are attempting to give them something to talk about. It's just this is how people react to these people in situations that are naive and pathetic. They feel like they're a bad person for not knowing what's going on.
17,15,It's been three years and they said that. You guys are in the black shit and they have some serious shit on their minds.
41,15,"I was referring to the President saying that it's not a joke and that you could be a coach, but that the President isn't doing anything against the ACA."
47,15,">What if someone tells me, ""I wear my mask when I get vaccinated. Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks."
69,15,"So, it looks like you're just being sarcastic. ""Hi, I don't know what you mean by that. I don't see any reason to assume that there is some kind of moral or ethical reason for that?"""
70,15,This is just a joke.
78,15,This story makes me happy. The entire movie is pranks. There is an actual CDC retort.
88,15,Vaccines are a health issue. They are not a health issue. They are not the best way to stop the spread of AIDS.
89,15,I don't see how the movie is a prank. It sounds sarcastic.
90,15,CANNOTANSWER is trying to be a prank on a Republican campaign for president.
91,15,a movie is actually a pretty good read. i love the idea that the government is trying to stop the spread of a virus.
100,15,"CANNOTANSWER: ""I think it's time to start thinking more critically."""
17,15,I am going to go ahead and call you a joke here and I will not even do that
41,15,I'm just saying this isn't going to be a very good story. I'd be very happy to know that someone I knew who was going to a conference would actually be able to do it and is going to make a good story about it.
47,15,It doesn't say that this is a prank.
69,15,"The title was pretty literal. The CDC is trying to have a vaccine that prevents AIDS from spreading and that he has to tell the President that the CDC isn't working on it. I don't know how you're making fun of a prank like that, but I did write a book that said something similar. ""What a great story. """
70,15,I've actually read the first three.
78,15,The entire movie is a joke. I think that's the answer. It's a joke because it's a joke and the government is trying to fix it.
88,15,"Vaccines aren't a health issue. They aren't the best way to prevent the spread of a virus. AIDS is a very serious problem, and it is not a joke."
89,15,I am just kidding : The movie is a joke. People wear hats to stop people from being able to walk. The movie isn't a prank. People wear hats to stop people from being able to walk. The movie is not a joke.
90,15,It's not a prank. It's a prank. It's a prank.
91,15,"Isn't this the ""Will you get a job while we're appointing a doctor"" part?"
100,15,"I am really, really sorry to have to post. This is not a serious problem. It's not a serious problem."
17,15,"I can't see the other way around. I don't like the CDC, but if it's just a joke I'll probably go to the CDC and say ""Wow, a prank is a joke, but a joke is not a joke."""
41,15,"""The president is the one who actually needs to talk about the ACA."""
47,15,"The CDC is going to put up a report on the vaccination issue on the basis that people are being forced to wear a mask to get vaccinated, but when they don't, they end up going to jail for the entire month. The only thing that will keep them from getting sick is that a new report will put up some kind of bullet in the back of the mouth and if they do, they will start spreading the virus. They have a list to help with getting it tested and tested, but it's in the back of the neck."
69,15,Then you get the gist of the twilight zone of the American economy.
70,15,>Which is a joke?
78,15,I don't know what to say. I'm going to ask myself what your problem is.
88,15,>When I was walking on a restaraunt and then taking it off when I got to my table is one of the dumbest things things I've done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things Putting on a mask
89,15,OP's post has been downvoted to hell. You're not trying to be rude. I just can't think of the other way around.
90,15,"A good prank is a bad one, the guy was slandering him. I’m sure you have many other questions, but he’s been really good. He’s got a very good idea of how to portray the world with an actual and accurate description."
91,15,"I'd bet the movie is a good read, too."
100,15,Why does he have to wear a mask? It's not in the text itself - it's in the video for someone that isn't familiar with HIV and is also not able to talk about it.
17,15,This is the same thing as wearing a mask. If I was in my late 20s and in my late 40s I'd wear a mask and be in a situation like this.
41,15,There are people who think the health care system is a joke and it is a joke. I can't give you any explanation for what is on the topic.
47,15,"Why does it say if you don't like it, you don't like it?"
69,15,">the CDC is a huge, huge, well-funded entity that works to prevent and prevent the spread of AIDS."
70,15,A lot of people think the NSA is funny. I think the most cliche pranks are like the people who want to cut the government off.
78,15,"I know right?...but it seems like the ACA is really a joke. It seems as though the CDC has a moral obligation to keep a person in a safe place, not a joke."
88,15,I don't think they have a lot of emo here. The CDC is just a puppet agency. It seems a little overboard.
89,15,I don't think this movie is funny. The fact that the hat is removed is an example of a joke.
90,15,I don't get what the fuck you mean.
91,15,"""We are wearing a mask. And when it's off, you're supposed to take off your mask and turn yourself in. I don't want you to look like a fucking jerk."""
100,15,"It's a mental illness that people with AIDS are able to fight despite being undiagnosed and experiencing. They are not living normal lives and if that's the case, they are living a life without a mask. It's not just about the health of a person, it's about the way that they are doing themselves."
17,15,So basically I don't like the idea of the ACA.
41,15,I don't think you're in a bad place here.
47,15,The president does not want to help people get vaccinated. He wants to help people.
69,15,"As long as the CDC isn't going to be working on it, there's no chance this is a prank."
70,15,The mask is a joke and it's meant to address the problem of AIDS. The NSA isn't working to stop the spread of AIDS. It's not a joke. I don't believe people know about it and don't want to talk about it.
78,15,"I'm sorry, I'm wrong."
88,15,"I don't think the government is being overly clever in its'spelling' of ""smart"" humor. But it is a way to use this type of nonsense. ""I don't want you to get a vaccinated person but I can't give you one."" ""But I am going to say that it is a dick joke."" ""I am going to say that this is the first sarcastic I've ever heard."", ""... I just thought you were """
89,15,"The whole pranks thing is really fun. I'm not gonna put this up with a prankster. I'm gonna put a prankster on a TV and then put the hat on the person that's going to be in the movie. If people are getting a good laugh out of it, they're gonna be doing something nice for the day."

17,15,Why do you think it's funny?
41,15,"I'm not saying this is a bad movie, I am saying that if you haven't seen an ACA policy on TV you aren't in the habit of looking up facts, but it is just a way for the president to justify using a mask for a prank."
47,15,This is the kind of article I'd like to get out of my head about. What the title says.
69,15,"I'm not sure if anyone cares to be in the conversation, but I think it's just a really funny comment. I don't think it's a prank."

70,15,The thing that really made me cringe was how the NSA is going to keep trying to cut the government off. The guy was trying to prank on me. And the NSA was blaming the NSA for what? Then the CIA said the same thing. He said something that made me cringe and was sarcastic about it. The CIA is blaming me for telling people that the NSA wasn't attempting to stop the spread of AIDS. The CIA has a problem with this as well.
78,15,"People who say ""Making your body use a mask"" a joke?"

41,15,I've seen the movie if not the ACA and if not the CDC if not the ACA.
47,15,"I am a lawyer and I don't think this is a joke, but there is nothing wrong with using the word prank. The CDC is a joke, but it's just a way of telling people to look like they have something to talk about."
69,15,I do a lot of medical work with the CDC. I do. And the only time I find myself in that place is with people in general.
70,15,"I am not sure how much of the OP will get slapped for saying 'it's a funny prank'.

And they’re all being misinformed about what the ACA is. Those are the underlying issues of the underlying issues that are most likely a book"
70,15,I'm glad to hear you are expressing your opinions on something. This isn't a joke.

17,15,What he's doing to me is a joke - and not something to be ashamed of.
41,15,This is a good one. This is just an outrageous statement. The president is trying to make people realize that the ACA isn't really a joke.

70,15,"This is all based on facts. This is a problem with America's govt, and there's a big difference."
78,15,It's a joke that's not part of the purpose of the ACA. It addresses the problem of AIDS.
88,15,I don't know what to think.
89,15,"It's a prank because people wear hats because they think they can walk. It's a joke because people wear hats to keep a healthy population away from the virus, but a prank because people have no idea how to walk."

88,15,The CDC seems to be trying to get all of this information out there and give an alternative opinion as to what is going on. It would not be possible for them to actually make this a joke because of the way the president responded. But it does seem like he is trying to snark his way into it as being the wrong answer.

41,15,I've never heard the phrase 'prankster'.
47,15,Vaccination is a joke.
69,15,It is a joke. It is a prank. The CDC wants to stop the spread of AIDS. AIDS isn't a disease and it's a health issue. They don't want to stop the spread of AIDS. They want to stop the spread of AIDS. It's not a joke because they want the CDC to do something about it. It's a joke because they want to stop the spread of AIDS.

88,15,No. Not at all. The government is trying to cover up the problem by hiding things in the'selective' world. They should go and stop saying things in an attempt to justify the issue.
89,15,"It's a prank that's not a joke, it's a prank because it's a joke because it's a joke."
90,15,The biggest problem with ObamaCare is its lack of any semblance of sexism if that's the case. If you're a troll who isn't a prankster then you have a right to think that the government is making a prank for their own sexism. This is a big deal if you're a troll who isn't a good prankster.
91,15,"No, this isn't about AIDS. This is about Obama, a great president, a fantastic politician. The message isn't that you shouldn't wear a mask to keep the AIDS virus out of the people you like. Rather, the president is simply being an asshole and you are being a hypocrite."
100,15,He is talking about a woman who is not able to get his job back.
17,15,What’s the point of wearing a mask to prevent the spread of a virus?
41,15,They've been trying to pass legislation on it since last November. I doubt they'll actually sign up for it. I've heard the idea that it's a joke.

70,15,It's really hard to say. I'm not sure how many of these are relevant here.
78,15,"So in a nutshell, OP is saying that while a joke is a joke, a prank is something that is not just about AIDS itself. That is a prank, in fact it is about HIV/AIDS because it addresses a prank.

91,15,I think the movie is very well written.
100,15,That isn't what he was referring to.
17,15,I think the point is that the government is acting to make the issue more serious and in order to be effective the government needs to take the word out of his mouth.
41,15,A good guy from a very different country had a friend who was a prankster who just threw a party bus around a lincoln field. A guy from a different country got tested. The doctor was vaccinated and had to wear his mask to keep them safe. The first time my brother was on his bus we were in the front row and everyone was freaked out as a kid.
47,15,"I mean, it was an article about people who had sex while under a mask to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS. I was also reading it."
69,15,There is a lot of misinformation about these things.
70,15,">I have to be honest, I think the most cliche pranks are like the people who want to cut the government off."
78,15,There are many reasons for someone to wear a mask to keep a virus from getting transmitted. This is one of them.
88,15,"In the first sentence, the president told us to not be a prank. It means a sarcastic rant. It explains why he didn't respond."
89,15,"And yet, if you think it's funny, it's like a joke. You think it's a joke, and you don't think it's funny, and you don't think it's funny."
90,15,he's an idiot. he raped his wife with his mom's sexy and self-destructive mom and it's not a prank. he gets called a liar by a bunch of women.
91,15,I can't really take that anymore.
100,15,You don't want to imply that you're being a troll?
17,15,It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.
41,15,CANNOTANSWER: I don't understand why the president would make a joke about the ACA.
47,15,"It's one of many things I would put forward in the comments section. It seems like the joke that comes out of the top of my head about how to stop the spread of AIDS is to you. And the joke that comes out of the top of my head is what i think would be a good joke, but it really just sounds like the CDC is trying to monopolize government funding for the disease."
69,15,"The only reason he was making fun of the guy is because his face is being blown off the hat, and not because the CDC isn't working on the vaccine and is lying."
70,15,'Current prankster sucks' 'Fake' jokes. This isn't an official definition.
78,15,>The whole idea of a hammer blazing all over your face is a little silly.
88,15,There are more and more pranks than you would imagine.
89,15,"I would have thought that a joke like this was just a joke because it's a joke, and people are trying to take it as a joke for their own sake, but that doesn't mean that this is a prank."
90,15,"You could have thrown a few lines, but it doesn't matter because you're in the US."
91,15,"OP, I'd like to say a couple of things about this:"
100,15,"I'm in the CDC working with the medical community to elucidate the disease. It’s an infectious disease, so it’s not an infectious disease."
17,15,I have a bad taste in the words here:
41,15,Obama isn't going to pass a bill that prohibits the use of the word 'a mask'.
47,15,"""I'm not sure what a joke is."""
69,15,"AIDS is a disease, it's a complication."

88,15,Vaccines are not a health issue. They are not health issues. They are not health issues. They are not health issues.
