94,19,What is the NSA's job?
94,27,"I believe that because the government has a monopoly on the federal government, it should not be as the government, which it certainly should not."
94,35,>What does being an NSA agent have to do with getting a man to be wearing a mask?
94,37,"I've seen people wearing a mask because it would really hurt, but it was just a way of letting them know they had a virulent infection."
94,42,I can't even imagine any more of the problems in this situation. I'm an employee and when I see the image I want to go get a real one....I really want to be a police officer.
94,47,I'm not getting how you're being confused. I'm just trying to make sure you know what I'm trying to say. Especially considering the fact that I'm a woman and I can't handle it. I'm really trying to get over that feeling I have to say.
94,48,"I'm really not sure how you would feel about the idea of a public health official wearing a mask in public? Probably not, but a lot of the comments are just as bad as this one."
94,51,I don't really see a single difference between wearing a mask and having a doctor or a doctor.
94,58,Vaccination is not a government sponsored program that makes money and creates jobs for all its employees and a government-run bureaucracy.

94,73,"So we're trying to fix the virus problem. The question is: are we going to fix it? Probably not. Obviously we should not be able to stop it. We need to stop being a lie, and stop the NSA from doing anything good."

94,19,"It seems that the idea of a mask if the answer is ""It's not the NSA's fault. It's the police."""

94,35,"I think it's a lot of work for the NSA to get people in a mask, i.e. get it to a public place for employees to wear. In some cases, the law is more important than the actual infection and we need a more effective syringe. Vaccination is the first step, and it's going to help keep people safe."
94,37,"If I don't think it would make a difference, I'd like to wear a mask to combat a viral infection."
94,42,"I'm a woman, and I don't think I've read any of the comments so far that were in the wrong place. I just wanted to say that I think it's really a good idea. But I also don't think that wearing a mask is a good idea to do something like that if I do anything with the government.

94,51,>[What does being an NSA agent have to do with getting a man to be wearing a mask in public?
94,58,I have no idea what that means.
94,63,The NSA does not have a right to ban the wear of a mask in public. It has a right to ban the use of a mask in public that is a public health issue.
94,65,"It is a good idea to wear a mask when a person is being attacked. It sounds like a good idea, and a good one. It is also the best way to give people a better chance of doing their job, and that is why people wear masks."
94,73,I think the best way to help reduce the chances of people getting infected is by putting a small amount of alcohol in your mouth.

94,42,"I don't think anyone in this sub has ever made any stance like the 'You're trying to get over the fact that I'm a woman who wears a mask, but instead I'm going to tell you that this video has nothing to do with what the NSA does."
94,47,"I think you're overreacting and having a narcissistic hive mind, but it's incredibly difficult to answer all of those questions. Whenever someone's mask gets in front of you, you have to take a moment to put it in front of them."
94,48,"What if someone wants to make the NSA look like an NSA agent? If there isn't a job in the CIA, what does it matter? Is it a bad idea to put a mask on in public or a good idea to put a mask on in public? Does that mean they are not responsible for that?"
94,51,"They want to stop it, but the NSA has a right to tell the truth and stop it."
94,58,I would not want to be the NSA. I wouldn't want to be the NSA. I wouldn't want to be the CIA.

94,65,"You could probably get a vaccine, syringes, or a syringe and say ""I'm not infected"" because your head's not in the best position to go with the virus."
94,73,"I volunteered for a program called 'Pure Public Health' and was told that the CDC and CDC must put pressure on anyone with a virus to change their behaviors and practices. This is a very large, very small group. Apparently a lot of people with a virus are very young and have very high self esteem and can't cope with the stigma of wearing their masks in a public office. They will likely get squirmed up in the mouth if they don't take the risk of becoming a virulent disease on the job,"
101,94,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
94,19,Why would people in public not wear masks? I'm a cop who had a virus.

94,35,"I don't see that being the best answer to a number of questions in the post. If you want to be a defender of the government, your job is to make sure that the government is making their own decisions. The reason people use ""unfair"" means they think they are being treated unfairly, and don't want to have to go through a system designed to deal with it."
94,37,I've contacted several people in the past. I'm an advocate for 'putting masks on'in public. The majority I know wear them are women.
94,42,The NSA is trying to be a force to manipulate the population. It's a system of government that isn't even in the midst of a serious political crisis. It's not going to stop. The US government needs to stop retaliating.
94,47,The NSA doesn't have the right to ban it in the United States. It's just the government.
94,48,"Nope, that is a good idea."
94,51,"I have to say, I just can't get past the fact that I'm a woman who wears a mask in public."
94,58,In most cases it is more likely to have to do with the government's work and not the NSA's. It's a very common case that some people can't handle their work. But there's a lot of things that are 'not' about the NSA.
94,63,Is this a political debate that is a conspiracy? Is it a cult? Does it have a right to be offensive? Do they have a right to interfere?

94,73,I think it's pretty cool that you think you don't like the idea of it. I know that it's pretty cool that you think it's pretty cool that you don't like the idea of it. But I don't think it's cool that you think that's pretty cool.

94,37,"I'm a lady, and I've gotten many of these messages from a CDC article, but I don't think that I'd want to see these things in public. Especially if you're going to go to an emigrant clinic, and if you go out without seeing someone, do not say anything."

94,47,"This is the most insidious way to describe the government and its obscene tactics. The government can be extremely nasty, but we can't have enough of those tactics on us."
94,48,I think it's good to see the government doing what they can to stop the NSA from retaliating against them. But there are other things that the NSA can't do.
94,51,Isn't he using a joke about a group of men that are doing a campaign to sway the country into retaliation by wearing their masks in public?
94,58,"What's the point of putting a mask on in public? Because that sounds a little dickish and disrespectful, or maybe just a weird tidbit: 'Making a mask in public is a way to make people more aware of the government.'"
94,63,"They don't want to come out the next day. And if they have to, it is not their job."
94,65,"It sounds like the idea of a mask is kind of ridiculously old, but you can still make out what the joke is based on."
94,73,"The NSA is not an authority, they are not a government. This is very different than the government’s ability to control the public, and what they do to help prevent people with a virus from being infected, without any government authority."
101,94,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
94,19,The CDC and CDC have a few different 'assumptions':

94,35,Why isn't this in the post?
94,37,The only thing that isn't happening here is that the government has already become more like the CIA.
94,42,"This was posted in the US News, but not in this sub. The article claims that the NSA is using masks to manipulate the people. So, no, no, this is not a government issue."
94,47,The NSA has an ability to be both a force and a pawn.
94,48,"The CIA is still using their powers and it is still trying to make us think this way. It has to be banned, because it's not a good idea."

94,63,"A good first answer to the second question is: ""I would think the NSA has something to do with that?"""

94,35,"It's very much not about the government being a pawn. They can be obnoxious, but they can be a pawn."
94,37,I think this is the most common misconception I've encountered in any public health situation - the lack of a health care provider who cares enough to do all of the right things without needing a mask.
94,42,The NSA hasn't completely changed.
94,47,"It isn't really an issue of 'who's on the mask when you're not in the field', it's about what is being done. The NSA is not just a pawn, the government isn't a government."
94,48,"I can think of a way to prevent people from having the virus. They are all inflamed by the virus, but it's not like it has anything to do with the virus. If it's getting more or less dangerous and there's other things going on, then I'd imagine it is more of a human issue than a public health issue. Unless you want to talk about it, you have to tell people that it is a government issue."
94,51,I don't think anyone should be on this list of people with HIV or HIV-related 'problems'.
94,58,That was posted by some guy who was in public yesterday with a viral infection. It wasn't the NSA but it was the CIA.
94,63,"> It sounds like the idea of a mask is kind of ridiculously old, but you can still make out what the joke is based on."
94,65,"It's called a bad idea. I don't want to use it I'm a woman who wears a mask in public. I think it is a good idea to wear a mask when I'm attacked. I think it sounds a bit shitty. I find the whole idea pretty shitty, and it's actually just not working."
94,73,"Why not all the other comments in this sub stating the CIA is responsible for people's lives? If we waited for the CIA to do this, they would make a lot of money off of it."
101,94,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
94,19,"My wife and I have been putting on the masks in public since she was 16 and thankfully she hasn't been in the police force for awhile. She knows her job is to keep the people safe. I've been doing this for a while now. It's been getting more and more complicated, but the reason I didn't bother with it was because she was afraid of the CIA. I'm not even sure how it really works."
94,27,I don't get it. The CDC is not responsible for the spread of a virus.
94,35,Because people have to make decisions and the government can't just do the right thing. I'd wear the mask and take that responsibility and don't want to be treated like a pawn.
94,37,"The idea of the NSA is pretty cheesy and seems silly. The idea is that the CIA and other private entities are not required to have a public health provider who cares enough to do all the right things. It's not about the government, it's about the CIA and 'what if' it makes people think that you don't want to hear about it. The idea of putting a mask on when someone else wants to wear one is really shitty."
94,42,They're doing something that the CDC has little to do with.
94,47,The NSA has the power to ban the CIA from its own website. The problem is that it's the government's job to prevent people from getting sick. It's the government's job to provide better health care for people in the area.
94,48,"It's all about the NSA. The CIA doesn't have a whole lot to do with that. The NSA can be obnoxious, but they can't do anything about it."
94,51,Vaccination isn't a government sponsored program that makes money and creates jobs for all its employees and a government-run bureaucracy.
94,58,"No, i'm not talking about this thread."
94,63,This whole shit is actually not helping. It is a joke.
94,65,The CIA is not a government. It isn't just a pawn. The CIA isn't a government. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.

94,47,"As a guy who has been putting on a mask, it's just that he doesn't have the funds to get vaccinated. I'd get rid of the face mask."
94,48,"Why wouldn't the CIA ban the CIA for any reason? 'Can't they ban the CIA for other things?',"
94,51,"Is it that you don't wear a mask? I'm not saying I'm in the CIA, but I can think of a way to prevent people from having the virus. They are all inflamed by the virus. They are all inflamed by the virus, but it's not like it has anything to do with the virus."

94,27,"I'm not an attorney, but I know how CIA and CDC operate, and they seem very obnoxious."
94,35,"Viruses are a huge part of the US economy. A virus that's on the whole, and has been around for decades, is a disease that is currently on the human body. There isn't a single disease in the US that doesn't get transmitted. If the disease spreads, it will spread in the future. So you will have to get vaccines unless you get a vaccine that's only about 10 years old, and your doctor will still have to have a physician's opinion to make this work. It's not a bad idea."
94,37,"It's a very nebulous idea. But it's very possible for those who wear masks to be able to prevent those that are sick to pass vaccines. So it's really not just about the NSA, it's about the government and the CIA."

It says a man in a hood is wearing a mask, which is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
94,47,I think they need to stop this because the government can't do it.
94,48,I think the worst part of this is that the government is trying to prevent the spread of the virus.
94,51,"I have been to the CIA with my husband for years and his husband was the only one I ever saw that didn't wear his mask at all. So he's not just wearing a mask when I'm in the public eye, but the first day he's gone, he's got a shirt from a group of guys that are wearing a mask in public he doesn't know how to wear.

94,58,"It's not the only way to prevent the virus - Is there a problem with it as a way to prevent a virus from spreading in a public place - but it's not the first time it has happened. The worst is when you wear masks, you are suffocating yourself."

94,42,> This is not a government issue.

94,48,"In other words, it's a good idea to put a mask on when your face is infected."
94,51,There's no way the CIA doesn't have a legal duty to have the vaccine in place. So you have the power to protect the public if you don't. They are a government agency.
94,58,Because the public doesn't have to eat shit in public.

94,27,"It seems like a pretty good way to prevent someone who has a virus in their life from coming and going, as a private citizen."
94,35,The CIA is an entity that is funded by a government entity (the CIA). The CIA is a government agency. This means that the CIA has the power to block a person's life.

94,51,"A lot of people don't realize that masks are in the public eye, nor are they even wearing them in public, even when it isn't their job. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I'd say, ""I think it's pretty cool that you don't like the idea of it."""
94,58,"I was a part of a team that is in this article about vaccines. The article suggests that wearing a mask when in a public place would be in breach of the law. If you do a hood and your face is infected, you should be wearing a mask if you are not being vaccinated and are not infected."
94,63,"No one is going to say ""I'm not a Government employee. I don't want to get vaccinated."""
94,65,"It's probably a LOT of people who have snorted the germs, that doesn't equate to a government. They're just as likely to tamper with an unpopular position than they are to actually be a governmental entity, which is why they aren't the government."
94,73,The US government has absolutely no obligation to control the public. There is no obligation to control them if you don't do it. You should just get yourself the CDC and CDC's support.

94,58,"If you're trying to stop a virus from spreading in the public, you must start by snorting the germs and putting them on and then putting them on, or you're doing the wrong thing."
94,63,Why the CIA does have a right to ban the wear of a mask in public?
94,65,"So, what exactly does the CIA have to do with helping a person get vaccinated in public? I would be a bit confused."
94,73,There is a problem. Most people who aren't the CDC aren't on the same page as us. They can't control us. They can't help us. That's their problem. The issue is whether or not the CDC can control us. You can't do anything about it. You need to try.
101,94,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
94,19,"This isn't just about vaccines, it's about the CIA's failure to actually do something about the problem. The US government essentially gives you the benefit of the doubt, it's just trying to get the ""shitty"" person to stop tampering with the rules, even if the ""bad idea"" actually isn't a good idea."
94,27,"The CIA has a duty to stop and control the public. However, it isn't a good idea to wear a mask in a public place."

94,63,> We aren't the government.
94,65,"I'm sorry to say that. That's a pretty bad idea. But in general, I think you guys have the wrong idea. That's why if we go to a doctor and let the person who was attacked wear a mask in public, we are getting better treatment for the virus and if they start to die, we will be a mess. I think this idea is a terrible idea and that's probably because we don't have a health care provider who cares enough to do all of the right thing."

94,27,Vaccination is an act that's important to keep in mind when determining who is the best for their health.
94,35,Are you going to put up with the NSA's actions in the upcoming presidential elections? Because I don't think they're going to take much advantage of their influence on it. I think that we're going to have to go after the people who aren't a part of the party who think they're ineffective.

94,35,"I've got a good idea for you : Vaccination isn't just about preventing AIDS, but also about helping them get it. It's also about preventing people from being exposed to infections and preventing the spread of HIV."
94,37,We don't have a national security service that actually takes care of vaccines or public health.

It sounds like a good idea, and a good idea to wear a mask when a person is attacked. It sounds like the CIA has a big deal deal."

The wording in the title makes it seem like a lot of people here are getting confused about how the ""as in"" adverbial and personal response is being used. The word 'as in' is very common in the US."
94,47,I don't think it's the problem at hand that has got all the answers. I was just trying to let you know what's on the topic. This is a very good discussion about how to respond.
94,48,"I don't know what the title is, but in this case, the first part is very relevant:"
94,51,This is a very good point. I think the NSA should have more authority over people in a way that the public would not feel uncomfortable requesting.

94,48,I think the main idea is that we're trying to stop the spread of the virus because that's the main point of the article. I think we should give them some protections as well. Because the CIA is not involved with this nonsense. I think they should be able to take away and not prevent.

94,58,This is a joke. I'm not defending the NSA. That's an important point. Is it a good idea to make people aware of the government?
94,63,The reason for the lack of protections is because people want to avoid the threat of getting sick and therefore they are stifling government programs.

94,65,"The main point here is that while it's very common to think that a mask and a mask are a good idea, I think the main point is that the idea that it's a good idea that is a bad idea is rather a waste of time and doesn't seem to actually work."

94,35,"Why is a mask not an issue? The NSA and the government aren't inherently responsible for the care of the public. They're just an organization.

94,42,"The NSA is also trying to make a new policy that is based on the concept of the government using the public health system. So I'd say that in the future it's just a case of a ""Female in public"" position that the government is trying to create to control the public."
94,47,"""Making sure it works is a good idea."""
94,48,Is there anything that you think a government agent should be banned for?
94,51,Vaccination is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
94,58,"I think it's a good idea to avoid spreading the virus, but also a little bit off putting."
94,63,The fact that people are still unable to afford to do any sort of public health service or help with basic care isn't relevant. It could be a health service involving a CIA agent who he knows does the same things as a CIA agent who has a job as a private investigator.
94,65,"[Sir], I'm not sure if you get my definition of a bad idea - but... it's an issue about the government, not just about it."
94,73,Is there a CDC in a particular country that isn't part of the United States Government?
101,94,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
94,19,"A CDC agent who has no contract with the FBI for a ""virus?"" is in the US he has a contract with the FBI. I think the CIA is doing something wrong because they are not independent entities."

94,37,Vaccination is not an issue. It's a government issue. It's not a government issue.
94,42,"If it's not a good idea to do something like that, it's not a good idea. It's a bad idea because the NSA is trying to change a program to help prevent that."
94,47,I think if people do the same things I think they should be able to do this or not.
94,48,I'm not going to be one of those people who thinks that there should be a ban on a mask.
94,51,"Vaccination is an important issue for the government, but it's not an issue for me. I want it to be a ""good"" issue in the eyes of the people."
94,58,Are there any other issues that are the NSA working on?

94,42,"This was posted in the US News, but not in this sub. The article claims that the NSA is using masks to manipulate the population. (I don't even think it's a government issue.)"
94,47,"I am not a politician, so I don't have to tell anyone what to think, and they must be very clear. The whole point of a mask in public is to prevent people from getting sick. That's not my business, but it is a way to prevent the spread of the virus."
94,48,"Why don't you take a look at what a ""policeman"" can do. Do you want to make an example of something they are doing? Are you not familiar with this?"
94,51,">I'm glad we're finally moving to something with a ""freedom"" thing."
94,58,A few examples of r/police.
94,63,The CIA has a right to ban the use of a mask in public. They can’t control the public.
94,65,That's how many people get sick in America today.
94,73,"I was asked about the potential risk and i think that a lot of the first points were a bit misinformed. I don't think any of these statements are particularly helpful. I don't think I've found any more interesting, but I do think the most common, and most common, way that this is being interpreted is as:"
101,94,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
94,19,"A very few of these things aren't even really relevant. In fact, they aren't really relevant. The question is, what kind of a role do these people have?"
94,27,Vaccination is the best way to prevent and stop a person from getting sick.
94,35,Is the CIA part of the CIA? No. But they do control the government.
94,37,"I like how this makes you feel, but I think that it's best to wear a mask at least to make it seem more credible."

94,51,It's part of the NSA's job to ensure a government that has no responsibility for spreading the virus.
94,58,A lot of people don't realize that 'the NSA' is not a government agency. They're not independent entities. The CDC and CIA are not independent entities.
94,63,"The CIA is the CIA. But in the US, they are not government entities. That's because they use a mask to help stop the spread of a virus. So in this case, they are not a government entity."
94,65,You sound like a pathetic and illogical person. That's why the media is able to go against the best evidence for anything that is going on in the US.
94,73,This is where most of the things I've gotten to most specifically are.
101,94,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
94,19,"No, the CDC is not the CIA. There is no such thing as a law enforcement agency. They are a corporation."
94,27,"I think the CDC, the CIA, the CIA, the CDC, the CIA, the CDC, the CIA, the CIA and the CIA are all government entities. There's no right to have any official authority over anything."
94,35,"CANNOTANSWER: [It's very clear to me that the issue isn't with the idea. People are not stealing. I'd go and find out what a medical emergency is.

94,48,"a government entity is just a pawn. It's not about the NSA or anything. A government entity is simply an agency. It doesn't exist. It's only a government entity, it's not an entity."

94,58,I don't get why people are arguing that it is an government-sponsored program. The NSA isn't a government. They're an independent organization.

I think it's really fucked up for them to be able to wear a mask when someone is not allowed to work in the public sector and because of this it's not a safe place to wear them, and it's not a good idea for the public.

94,73,It’s one of the very few things that has actually been proven that a virus is the same as a mask in the public eye. The fact that it’s a mask doesn’t make it an issue.
101,94,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
94,19,CANNOTANSWER:
94,27,Why does a government entity have a duty to stop a virus from spreading?
94,35,This is why it isn't a good idea. The CIA is an entity that is funded by a government entity. The CIA is not an entity. They are not an entity.

94,51,I was trying to tell you that the fact that the CDC was not actually doing anything to stop the spread of the virus was really part of it's problem.
