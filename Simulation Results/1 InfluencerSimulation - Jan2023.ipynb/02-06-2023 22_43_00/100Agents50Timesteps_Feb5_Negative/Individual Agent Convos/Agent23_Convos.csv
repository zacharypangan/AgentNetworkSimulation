87,23,"I’d say the mask is a bad idea, you shouldn’t wear it because you want to live a frighteningly long life. I hate it when the people who say the same thing don’t respect me and don’t want to be hurt. I just like putting on a mask to have a nice day and feeling the air around me."

23,18,We've gotta keep our heads up if we want to get vaccinated.
23,19,I think this article should be made into a post that you may have a great idea about. I am really not sure what you are trying to get across. I am in the US so I am not sure if this is how you are about to go around doing this and if you have an issue with me wearing a mask I may try to tell you to just suck it up a bit.
23,22,We have a policy regarding wearing a mask. It prevents people from traveling and being vaccinated with a vaccine. The policy does not permit the public to drive to the university in a mask or helmet. It allows it to be worn while a public health department is going to be out of the country.

I don't know if this has happened before, but I'm not familiar with the laws on wearing a mask for public health if it happens to people who aren't currently on the field. Is this an issue in policing? Are these things being implemented? Is this even being introduced in the public health department?"
41,23,I don't know why you think putting on a mask gives you the right to be in public.

23,9,You are a fucking dumb ass. What you are talking about is not what you are saying.
23,18,Yes. We have a policy regarding wearing a mask. They say it prevents people from traveling and being vaccinated with a vaccine. The policy does not permit the public to drive to the university in a mask or helmet. It allows it to be worn while a public health department is going to be out of the country.

41,23,"I feel like this has nothing to do with the policy at all but with the fact that they are not going to change any time soon. I don't think a single person has a right to be in a public space. The mask is for a reason, it's for someone."
50,23,"As a former American who has also tried to fight a viral infection, I firmly believe that vaccines do nothing to stop the spread of the virus."
59,23,So OOC says that wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. I think it's the best way to stop the spread of a virus. I think it's not a good way to stop a clot from spreading to someone's body.
66,23,What does your dad say? The mask is dangerous to his health and may prevent him from spreading it.
68,23,"I can't think of any other person who would not be able to do that. I mean, this seems ridiculous. And we don't even have the medical equipment for it. It's not going to get better if people don't do it. And I'm assuming you mean the slammer, right?"
70,23,"There's a funny movie on /r/rogersofthepast starring Richard Branson, ""Oh you dont like wearing a mask"" about a woman who wears a mask outside and in her car alone for protection against the spread of a virus."
72,23,>I'm not against vacks mandates cuz they ruin the economy get people fired and people should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force
78,23,I can only imagine what they are like as the same thing.
87,23,The guy is going to use it on this sub because it will put a lot of doubt about if this person really is a bad guy.
93,23,... which is the key word for the ACA.
101,23,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
23,4,I'm very upset because this is the first time I've ever heard something like this - you don't get to 'do it' and get an actual vaccination? You can't do it. You aren't going to rehash the point you are making.
23,6,"The masks, masks and other safety precautions are the only things I have seen on a regular basis. I'd recommend having one - preferably in a comfortable place - and to prevent any sort of respiratory disease, such as HIV or the like."

23,18,"I'm not a conservative, but this is the kind of thing I would do to defend the ACA. Specifically, the use of ""we should not be in a public place"" to restrict and discourage participation in a medical situation, and it's a stupid idea."
23,19,The ACA is not meant to protect against the spread of HIV/AIDS.
23,22,A mask is not a mandatory form of immunisation. A person wearing one can be banned from attending a public health event without getting vaccinated and not wearing it.
24,23,What about the other trump supporters?
33,23,I think this is the problem here because it is so common in people in many parts of the country.
36,23,> So you are saying that it's illegal to make your own health insurance policies? It's illegal. That's just ridiculous. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
40,23,This isn't a joke. This is the fact that the medical department is making a big deal about public health.
41,23,"So, the ""no one cares if someone is vaccinated."""
50,23,You're going to get sick from trying to fight a virus.
59,23,It is a nitpick. People in the US are accustomed to nitpicking a bunch of things that are wrong. You seem to think that 'putting on a mask' is a nitpick. People in the US are accustomed to nitpicking a bunch of things that are wrong.

70,23,"So, is it the same person that reads the article and is actually saying it is a joke?"
72,23,"It's an issue of safety, not an issue of health. It's one of the only things that actually bothers me about being in a position to avoid the spread of SARS. It's an issue of public health. And I'm glad this is not one of those things."
78,23,A good example of a joke. A bit of what?
87,23,"What does he say, “I just want a nice day and feeling the air around me” mean?"

87,23,I like to think of it as a way to hide my fears and fear of the virus.
93,23,It's interesting the president wants to stop covering his own face for that reason and make it clear to everyone he's a tyrant.

23,18,"I think the problem with the ACA is that it does not allow the public to have a medical situation, while in fact, the most important is that this does not allow for a medical necessity to be vaccinated."
23,19,"I had a friend who went to see this movie once when I was in my 20s. He was on a plane and said ""I don't really see how you can stop it. I don't want to get killed."
23,22,"The NSA is an arm of the government. It's a prank. If the gov't wanted to keep the virus away from public health officials, then the gov't couldn't do anything about it."
24,23,"So you're saying ""I was not smart enough to do that, but I am not going to get any vaccine for a month now, because I am so sick."" /r/reflection"
33,23,The US is a bit opportunistic. The President is a tyrant who wants to change the health care system.
36,23,"Vaccination is an illegal thing, and one that has never been done. I love the movie, but I can't stand the idea."
40,23,"What are you saying about ""so many people in our nation don't know it is a joke, and that's a big deal to me""?"
41,23,I think the whole idea is ridiculous.
50,23,"I'm not really sure how the NSA and CDC can actually get along with the vaccine, but I agree with them that there are some things you can do to prevent it from spread."

72,23,People want a new way of thinking. The real problem here is that the government is so slammed on people to help prevent it.
78,23,I've read that there are people who wear masks and they're sick.
87,23,It's a little too literal for a joke and the rest of the world can't really explain it.

23,7,"I would wear a mask, you know, to avoid the effects of HIV/AIDS."

23,22,"... a lot of people are saying that the Obamacare is a joke, and the NSA is a prank. There is no need to get vaccinated. This is not a good idea and is not good for everyone."
24,23,It seems like a lot of people haven't really noticed the whole issue.
33,23,I have no idea why you're having issues with this.
36,23,It sounds like the President isn't in charge of the healthcare and has a hard time preventing the virus from spread.
40,23,The CDC is the only NSA agency that can have a serious job protecting people from infection. That's the only NSA agency that has any responsibilities that the CDC actually has.
41,23,Vaccination mandates do not address the issue of who is allowed in public space or who is protected by the law.
50,23,"Vaccines are not the best way to fight off the virus, but they are good at stopping it."
59,23,"They're not going to have any evidence to stop it, but the government needs to know. It doesn't seem like a joke and it doesn't sound like the government has any evidence to stop it, and that's how we see the movie."
66,23,"I know this was written when I was a child, but a bit late in the movie but I was a part of the film because I wanted to see the movie and the first thing I did was look at the picture on the sidebar. It was a bit of a horror movie."

93,23,"OP, we have to understand what the ACA is for, not the president."
101,23,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
23,4,"The president is in the wrong. The hysterectomy was a joke, and his hair was so bad that the mask made it bleed."
23,6,People think that wearing a mask is the best way to prevent the spread of a virus and to prevent any form of infection from originating in your home. They can also say that a mask doesn't work for everyone or it doesn't help in the same way that a virus is.
23,7,"I think I'll go by the CDC name. They're a really good agency, but I think it's quite a bit different."
23,8,">You're a fucking dumb ass. What you are talking about is not what you are saying. The ACA is not about public health and prevents the spread of viruses. Its a prank called ""the health of our country."" There are things we can do to prevent it and it is part of the health care system."

23,22,>A person wearing a mask can be banned from attending a public health event without getting vaccinated and not wearing it.
24,23,"This is really bad. It is ridiculous to have to make it a point. We need to keep doing it. I mean that's not what I intended to write. You're saying you want to be the best candidate to have a good shot at winning the presidency.

33,23,The president is a tyrant who wants to change the health care system.
36,23,The article states that he is against these mandates because it makes a problem of the government's policies. The idea that they are opportunistic is not relevant in this context. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
40,23,>How does the mask make his breath come out of the back of his head?

93,23,A very serious question. Is the article saying that the President of the United States is a tyrant who wants to get rid of any form of health care?

72,23,The entire point of this movie isn't what's at issue. Is it not about the hysteria?

23,22,"Well, if that translates to a public health event being out of town without a vaccinated person, that translates to a crowded park with no public health departments. So this is an issue not that one person is going to fix, but that the president is going to take on the role of the prankster, in order to make it ineffective.

23,6,I am on mobile so I can only make a few calls about a joke you have seen on your phone.
23,7,"I am a doctor, so I am not the cheapest. I feel like I can have a very high quality vaccination for sure, but I cannot get into a group of people that need my assistance unless I have a bad diagnosis. Hopefully the vaccinated person isn't going to die soon!"

33,23,"That's so dumb. The article isn't a prank, but the article is referring to the fact that the president is a tyrant who wants to repeal the ACA. I can't see how a troll could say ""I don't think the government is trying to make people think they have a problem with the government. It's trying to make people think they have a problem with the government."""
36,23,"I mean, if he's against a veto of ACA, what's he talking about? Because he has no right to change his mind. The ACA is for the people, if anyone is against a veto, I'd go with the fact that the ACA would cause harm. If he's not opposed to a veto, I'd also go with the veto that would make the veto the same as the veto of the president and then I'd give them an important job."
40,23,The joke itself isn't wrong. They are a joke that the CDC is trying to be in an effort to stop the spread of the ACA.
41,23,The whole thing is a prank. The President has an innate sense of responsibility and a right to have an office. This prank makes it hard to believe that the government cares about public health.
50,23,Why does the president have to wear a mask to protect himself? It sounds like you are talking about the AIDS virus. Why would you have to wear a mask to stop a virus?

66,23,I read that the article was not about the ACA. It is an excellent book.
68,23,They're not allowing it to be worn because they don't fit the ACA's provisions. But they are allowing it to be worn despite the fact that it's a joke.
70,23,a mask is just like an igloo.

93,23,"The article is misleading, a lot of it 'explains' what the article is about. It's a lot of shit."
101,23,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
23,4,A sexist joke is something that can't be joked or fixed. :-(
23,6,I think the prank is that people think the ACA is for the people and that they are not against repealing it and they are saying it was a prank.
23,7,"The CDC is in the process of banning it. And they are using a mask that is ineffective, that if people don't wear it, they are going to have to veto it."
23,8,I think that OP is correct about the fact that they aren't actually trying to stop the spread of a virus by taking a vaccinated person to a twitchcon a lot of places.
23,9,We're not going to get rid of any form of health care. Please wear a mask.
23,18,>I'm going to say this about twitchcon and masks you can hate me if the state town doesn't have an mandates
23,19,You think that the government is blaming it for a joke that doesn't even fit the ACA's provisions?

24,23,"I agree that this is a good idea, and I think it's a good thing they're trying to bring something to the table. But I don't think I read anything into it. Then again, i think i read a lot of his articles. And I'm a little over it, so I can't really know the exact answer to each one."

36,23,I was gonna say that I have a friend who has the same sort of thing.
40,23,A joke that's about a CDC and a CDC-esque CDC policy.
41,23,"It was a prank, not a movie."
50,23,This has nothing to do with the AIDS virus and nothing to do with the health care system.
59,23,"It's interesting that OOC is a CIA and FDA official. The Obama administration is a CIA agent. They have not talked about that before and their efforts to nitpick the facts don't seem to have any credibility, they have been to the US for years and people are still using it as a political tool. I'm not saying OOC is a tyrant but the CIA and FDA seem to be trying to trick people into believing that they are responsible for the problem, and they are trying to cover up the shit."
66,23,This movie sounds kind of like a hive mind book.
68,23,I've never been able to wear my mask because I haven't done it. I can't think of any other person who would not be able to do that.

23,6,"There are a lot of different examples of a prank called ""the ACA""."
23,7,It's not a joke. 'The president is a tyrant who wants to get rid of any form of health care. Please wear a mask' is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
23,8,"I slammed the ACA to death, I know it doesn't even come to that but the CDC's policies are not going to get rid of the CDC."
23,9,"The article is misleading, a lot of it 'explains' what the article is about. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of a virus."

23,22,"If someone doesn't like the ACA, that's a great one."
24,23,Vaccinating the president does not prevent the spread of HIV. I feel like that's a good idea. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of a virus. Please wear masks.
33,23,I think it's interesting the president is trying to get people to take action against his ACA.
36,23,It was a good movie but it wasn't as good as a new ACA or the movie.
40,23,"I'm not sure that's what I was referring to. I've been following this whole ACA thing for a while, and even though I'm a big fan of Obama, this is still a joke. Rather than being an idiot about the ACA, I was referring to the fact that the CDC has a bigger job of protecting people than any other agency in the US. Basically, the Obama administration doesn't have a lot of power in the CIA, or any other agency. They are probably the ones who put on a remarking"
41,23,A prank by the president.
50,23,Why not give the President an ultimatum to stay out of your house?
59,23,People aren't conditioned to believe they are responsible for preventing the spread of a virus.
66,23,"I like to write a lot of things that don't involve the whole ""How do I stop the spread of a virus."" quote."
68,23,>... the government is only allowed to do it because it does not comply with the ACA. They need to make it more of an acceptable use.

72,23,A good satire about the AIDS virus is a great movie.
78,23,"I want to cite one thing about the movie, but I also want to see that the president is a skeptic - and I would love to be able to show him some evidence that he actually believes in this act. Those are examples of the presidents aphorism. The ACA isn't a prank. It's a joke because it's a joke. The ACA isn't a joke because it's a joke. The ACA is a joke because it's not a joke, the president"
87,23,"It sounds like a hive mind will be able to suck a hive mind and take the joke to a real level of absurdity. I'm sure there are plenty of people who think this is a joke, but are more than likely going to get frustrated."
93,23,It's a conspiracy theory that the people of the ACA are not against it. This isn't a true story. It's a good hive mind.
101,23,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
23,4,I'm not saying that this is a prank.
23,6,It's not funny that he's trying to get people to put on a mask.

23,18,This is a joke. It is a joke. It's an aphorism. It's a joke. It's a joke. But it's a prank.
23,19,"No, I don't."
23,22,Is this a quote about the ACA as a prank?
24,23,So the president would wear a mask for the rest of his life?
33,23,People in the US aren't aware that the ACA is a joke. We're not going to be able to change the health system.

41,23,"Well, I'd also like to note that, in the context of this thread, the CDC is a conspiracy theorist, so they aren't supposed to be in any way responsible for the health of people in public, and thus shouldn't have acted in a manner that could have had a similar effect, but have it be clearer to the public they are a conspiracy theorist."
50,23,I'm pretty sure the entire point of this post is that Obama was trying to turn people's perceptions into a way to be more informed about how the president is in the world.

This has nothing to do with how you are being censored, and is a prank, it doesn't exist because you can't have any one of these programs to help you in getting the vaccine or putting you in a public hospital. The prank doesn't need to be true, it's a joke, it just needs to be made. And it's ridiculous to say,"
23,7,"The President, on his part, is a troll and a troll in his own right. The whole ACA has been a cliche for decades, and it's never going to be a joke."

23,18,"I'm not going to lie, I'm trying to defend the ACA."
23,19,Isn't the president's name Obama?
23,22,"No, you are wrong. The NSA is in a bad way. If they didn't have a policy of not having to go to any public health events without getting vaccinated then they'd be in a position to take care of their own health issues."
24,23,"I don't think the problem lies with whether it's a joke, the lack of a solution, or the failure of the ACA. I just think it's really a prank."

93,23,"The Obamacare law isn't a political issue. It's a conspiracy theory that the government has nothing to do with, and it's based on the ACA.

23,22,It's a good thing that the Obamacare prank will be addressed in the public health post. I'm not sure what the Obamacare prank is about.

72,23,It is a prank. It's not a joke. It's just a prank.
78,23,">As someone who has worked in CDC for 6 years and has never seen the movie,"
87,23,...I think the joke is about how a person who wears a mask should be treated and why a man should not wear a mask to hide his fears and fear of the virus.
93,23,I was just reading it a couple of hours ago.
101,23,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
23,4,"CANNOTANSWER: In my opinion, the joke is a joke, but it doesn't make a point."
23,6,"In the article, there is a joke about how if people don't take the time to put on a mask, and you go to a CDC meeting, they just won't stop people from going. The joke is more about the sexist hat that he is saying is the first step, not the prank he wants to do."
23,7,CANNOTANSWER:
23,8,It's not a joke. It's just a joke. It's not a joke.
23,9,The whole thing is about how hysterical and offensive it's become.
23,18,"This is my point: 'the ACA has been a major influence on the issue', but it's not an article. I think it's a joke because it's a joke, but it's a joke."
23,19,AIDS is not a joke in the United States. It's a problem in all 50 states and if this is a joke then it's not a joke.
23,22,"So basically that's the ""doctor in the movie"" joke? This is about the CDC and how they are doing their jobs in order to help prevent the spread of a virus, which is something that's kind of funny but also isn't something that's really good."
24,23,Vaccinating is good but a joke doesn't have to stop the spread of HIV.
33,23,"If you ever think about the president you see that he wants to be a tyrant, but is doing it in a way that actually stops people from getting sick."
36,23,Those are all good words to summarize.
40,23,"He may be on a health care advisory board, but there’s something there he should be aware of as well as the public. He might have some concerns for his employer, but that’s what the CDC tries to avoid."
41,23,The CDC is trying to be a dick about a prank on us. The whole ACA thing is ridiculous.
50,23,So you read the article and then said that you don't know what it means? Unless you think you are talking about HIV and you think the CDC is trying to manipulate the public opinion.
59,23,CANNOTANSWER:
66,23,"Then read the book, if you're not a doctor."
68,23,"As a lawyer I can tell you the best thing to do is go to your doctor and get a proper mask (this is not a joke) that prevents the spread of AIDS (this is the best way to stop the spread of a virus). It’s not a joke. It’s a joke, but they are trying to derail the ACA."

72,23,"This is what is going on here. Honestly, you've got to be smart, if you're going to ask if someone in the CDC is talking about the AIDS epidemic. What do you think about the AIDS epidemic, and if they are?"
78,23,"CANNOTANSWER, ""I read that the ACA was a joke because it addresses the problem of AIDS."
87,23,The problem is that the people in the movie did not want to be a joke.
93,23,"I grew up in the US, and while I was still in college, i had to read a lot of the articles on that country, and most of them were in english. I also learned that it is possible that the president of the country would be the last president in the country to go on the presidential election, though, in English is very likely the case."
101,23,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
23,4,"It sounds like the article is going to be an interesting read. It doesn't make the point ""The ACA is a joke because it was a joke"" but it is a joke that the CDC is trying to make a point that it isn't a joke. It is a joke that it is supposed to make people more aware of the ACA."
23,6,I read that the ACA was a prank because it addresses the problem of AIDS. The problem is that the people in the movie did not want to be a joke.
23,7,This post has been on the front page for nearly two weeks and I can't think of anything.
23,8,You're not being serious about this. The ACA is a joke that makes me uncomfortable.
23,9,"In a nutshell, I am a doctor, and I'm going to put a mask on before a meeting, and then I'll come back to you saying that this is a joke because it's just one of those things the media tries to get on us."
23,18,aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
23,19,You said he was being incredibly obtuse. He was trying to play the blame game.
23,22,"The ACA was passed because of the spread of AIDS, and is therefore a joke. The President is trying to make it a joke about it."
24,23,"CANNOTANSWER, I AM"
33,23,This is a great movie. It is the only one I can recommend.
36,23,That's not a joke. It's a joke. You're just telling the truth.
40,23,"It's one of the most bizarre and incredibly blatant pranks I've ever seen and it makes me really cringe every time I watch it. It's a good movie, but I still don't get it."
41,23,So CDC is using the ACA to try to block them from taking the ACA?
50,23,The CDC is an anti-HIV dick. It's a prank to the president and a prank to the president to prevent him from getting infected.
59,23,"CANNOTANSWER, i want to hear from you guys."
66,23,The CDC report says the hysterectomy was done by an AIDS doctor. It is a joke.
68,23,Why are you being downvoted to hell based on your comment?
70,23,"i was in a movie and I read the book and was surprised to see that this was the first one i saw in a long time. it's amazing what i can actually tell you about this movie: i know how i got hurt in it, i know that i have an allergy and it can lead to lung cancer, but i haven't seen it in a long time, i can't believe that i never did. i can see why some people wouldn't like that the cdc is a joke as an a"
72,23,I think it's a prank. A joke is not an actual joke if it's about the actual issue of the AIDS epidemic.
78,23,That's the point. The point was that the President had no idea that the issue of AIDS was a joke.
87,23,A lot of things are not funny. It's just a joke.
93,23,"This isn’t just about politics, it’s about the people in power."
101,23,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
23,4,"""...why are you being downvoted to hell based on your comment? I'm pretty sure the entire point is that the ACA is a joke"
23,6,I like the movie and I read the book. I can't even get into it right now.
23,7,"The CDC is being criticized for trying to make it look like the president's retort on the ACA is actually a joke that is about the ACA itself. The CDC is saying that because it is being retorted, it can't stop the ACA from spreading."
23,8,"What about going to a doctor's office? The doctor, or their assistant? If you don't like him, you should consider going and signing up for a health insurance plan. The president needs to put out a letter to every senator, to ensure that he can't do things that aren't really medical-related."
23,9,"The ACA is a joke about being able to access health insurance. That ACA is not a joke. It is a joke about the ACA, about not wanting people to get to have access to it because it is a joke."
23,18,I see a joke is a joke.
23,19,"Vaccination is not a joke and the ACA is a prank. It isn't a joke. The ACA is an 'Obamacare' joke and a 'Joke' to protect AIDS. It isn't a joke to prevent HIV, it's a joke to prevent the spread of AIDS, and it isn't a joke. It's a joke because it's about the issue, and a joke to prevent it."
23,22,"It's a joke, and I'd think that's it. It sounds silly, but I don't get why people would be upset about it."
24,23,"This ain't a joke, this is a joke. This is the ain't the ain't the ain't the ain't."
33,23,He's trying to get attention on the government. He's just trying to get attention on this shit. I'm just gonna give you the bottom line: he is the president who wants to repeal the ACA.
36,23,"It's a joke. It's a joke. The movie is about the ACA, and not the person wearing the mask. So, the book is a joke."
40,23,It is an utter mess. It's not a joke.
41,23,"The ACA is the only ACA law a senator can take into consideration. The CDC and its allies have been trying to repeal it for quite a while, but they aren't really the one to do anything."
50,23,I'm sick of this. I had a bad day at work. I have a hysterectomy every day to remove a virus and the doctor tells me I needed to come and get tested. I had to make up a whole lot of jokes for a week. I was a huge narcissist. Now I'm sick of the jokes. I snoop on everything.

66,23,I have to say I think this isn't a good book. The CDC hysterectomy is in fact the best way to prevent this disease. That and that he is an AIDS doctor whose husband had it done for a very important reason.
68,23,CANNOTANSWER:
70,23,That was pretty bad news for everyone involved.
72,23,"If there's anything on the front page about the AIDS epidemic, there's not a movie about it."
78,23,What is a joke? Does the joke address the problem of HIV/AIDS? Does the ACA address it? What is a joke?
87,23,"""We said it was a joke because it’s funny"
93,23,"It seems a lot of things are being said, but the first paragraph doesn't make sense."
101,23,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
23,4,I've heard the article isn't about the president. It's about a prank that is meant to be aimed at the general public.

23,19,The author is being incredibly obtuse as a joke.
23,22,"The article says that the president has never been asked to do a prank but wants to do so because his job is to protect people from the spread of HIV/AIDS. In addition to that, I am not saying it's an illegal policy to prevent those who need to be vaccinated, but that the CDC tries to cover up this nonsense. I'm just saying that the CDC is being misinterpreted by those who are concerned about the CDC. If the CDC hasn't gotten in touch with the CDC, they will probably do a letter to the"
24,23,The author wrote a chapter that goes from 'I'm a troll' to 'I'm not a joke'.
33,23,The story is misleading. The story is misleading. The article is misleading. The story is misleading.
36,23,It's just a joke. The movie is about the ACA. It's a prank. The ACA is a joke. And the people who wore it aren't going to be able to tell if the CDC's a joke about it.
40,23,The president is not going to play games without being tagged by the people he supports.
41,23,"I was at a concert tonight to have the ""i don't know what the point is"" in the last half hour with my girlfriend. She said that when we went to the conference in California, ""it was very cold outside so I went home and did not go"" and that it was just a joke. She's a very brave man, and I have no problem with it as long as she doesn't smoke."
50,23,...and... I think it's a joke because they want to prevent the spread of a virus.
59,23,I'm a very knowledgeable person. I don't think there's any difference between being able to make a big argument about health care. What we're saying isn't exactly about 'putting on a mask'. There's a lot of facts that are based on the same fact.
66,23,I don't know whether you're a doctor or a troll.
68,23,ACA is a joke and isn't about protecting any person from their own health.
70,23,"The movie is actually about the CIA and the people he is trying to get to work with, but it doesn't have the morality to stop it. It is more about the people he is working with who are being pranksters and who are trying to get to work with him."
72,23,the movie is about the AIDS epidemic.
78,23,It's an inherently funny joke.

23,22,"If the CDC has not reached out to the CDC, they will probably have to impose a law on the President in order to stop it."
24,23,So here's what I came to say:
33,23,I've seen this a couple times in my life.
36,23,CANNOTANSWER. The joke makes sense because it doesn't have anything to do with a prank. The movie is an excellent read. The book is an excellent read.
40,23,A bunch of people have a very personal agenda with the CDC.
41,23,"They're not going to change any time soon because of the ACA, but the fact that they are not going to change any time soon is why they are not doing anything about it. I don't think it's the same as the ACA's. You haven't heard of them being the biggest prank nutjobs in a long time and they're clearly more in tune with the ACA than anyone thinks they are. It's also that the idea that '""the ACA""', and ''' were a prank,"
50,23,I can't believe how much of this was a joke and how much sexist the CDC is.
59,23,It's a joke. It's not a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.

23,7,"I think the president's intentions are clear enough that he would do something about it, to make it less obvious, without making it seem like a joke. It's not funny. It's a joke."
23,8,Those people are not 'trolls'. They're just being trolls.
23,9,I would tell a reporter that this is being a prank. But that is not the joke. The joke makes it seem that the president is trying to snare the real president.
23,18,"I mean I don't see that as being a joke. It's just a prank. The entire thing is a joke, and it's just a joke."
23,19,I'm trying to say that the first part of the story is a joke.
23,22,"A prank, and a joke. What are the risks associated with it?"
24,23,"The ACA was designed to help prevent the spread of HIV in the United States, while addressing a common problem. A prankster in this situation probably has the opposite idea. The ACA is the least effective cure."
33,23,I would love to see someone get his head straight in a hat and go through the bathroom if he did.
36,23,"You said you didn't want to be a troll, and then you said you want to be a troll because that's what you mean."
40,23,What exactly is the joke? That the CDC has no control over what it does in this case?
41,23,It's just a joke and isn't even about Obama or the CDC.
50,23,"As a doctor who has gotten vaccinated to a lot of AIDS and he doesn't think it's possible, I think he needs to wear a mask more often. It could mean a lot more than a mask."
59,23,">But I'm thinking more and more of this: People aren't conditioned to believe they are responsible for preventing the spread of a virus."""
66,23,It's a book about the ACA. The author is not a doctor and is doing it to stop the spread of the virus. This is the main reason the ACA wasn't passed in his lifetime.

23,22,>We have a policy regarding wearing a mask. It allows it to be worn while a public health department is going to be out of town without getting vaccinated and not wearing it.

50,23,The CDC is an anti-HIV dick. They are trying to manipulate the public opinion.

68,23,There's a lot of nonsense in this subreddit that makes it seem like this is the kind of nonsense that gets downvoted based on it's meaning. It's not like 'we don't really have enough medical equipment to do this' is a joke or an apology.'
70,23,">The whole thing is really interesting reading about it. It sounds like the movie was really funny, but I am not a big fan of the NSA. I am going to see the mask of the past and I am getting my own insurance. I am going to see the mask of the past."""

87,23,“A prank” is a joke because it is the idea that this person is wearing a mask to prevent the spread of a virus.
93,23,The ACA isn't the only health care that the American people need. The US is a state and a federal agency. The government has to get rid of it.

23,4,So I would say that you should think more about the ACA rather than the ACA.
23,6,It's a joke about the ACA. It's a joke about the ACA.
23,7,... And what do you think of the CDC and Obamacare. They don't make jokes about anything.
23,8,"A LOT of the ACA stuff is still a joke. You get the idea of the ACA being good to you and the CDC and your friends. If you can afford it, then your health insurance will still be at a disadvantage. The ACA doesn't stop the spread of HIV/AIDS."

41,23,[[Nevada_Historian]:
50,23,The president is probably more likely to get infected than not because of the mask he is wearing and has to keep it on his face. If he's not infecting people then he's not going to stay there at all. It's all about his health. I'm sure they'll find a way to avoid it in the future as he is a dick.

68,23,It's hard to tell how many people would be upset with the ACA because it's supposed to prevent AIDS or the fact that people get sick from wearing their own'mom' mask.
70,23,> It is about the people who are pranksters and the government trying to prevent the spread of the disease. The ACA is not intended to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS.
72,23,"The story, and the hysteria it is about are not related. But it is a joke, and not a joke, mainly because they are on purpose. They are in response to a hysteria that is a joke. It doesn't make any sense that the author was trying to justify the fact that he is putting on the hat and not the CDC. But a joke has become irrelevant and not relevant to the hysteria."

33,23,I'm not gonna pretend I know that the people who said they don't wear a mask aren't the ones who are trying to jive with the government.
36,23,The whole thing is just a prank. The story isn't about the ACA. 'The president is a tyrant' is how I view the world.
40,23,"There isn't really much a joke about the ACA, but if it was about him wearing a mask, the CDC would be in a much bigger position than he is."
41,23,"The ACA is a joke, not a prank."
