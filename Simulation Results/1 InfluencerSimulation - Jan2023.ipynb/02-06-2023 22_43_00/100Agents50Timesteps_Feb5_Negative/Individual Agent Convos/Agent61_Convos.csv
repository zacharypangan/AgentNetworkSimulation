87,61,oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that
96,61,if you wear a mask outside or in your car alone your gullible and submissive not traits you want to project
61,8,OP is wearing a mask to obliterate the virus
61,9,If he was wearing a mask outside or in a car alone he would have a hard time breathing
61,13,The people who scream about it get it.
61,34,"Why do people think you are gullible and submissive? Is it just to say that, no one wants to hear that."
61,51,I am not a very competent person but I think it would be a great idea if the government had to implement a new set of safety measures to keep the population out of the hood.
66,61,Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of a virus. Please wear masks.
71,61,Oh really? What if they got vaccinated with the newest strain of a virus?
87,61,"I'm talking about wearing a mask for a time, and I'm not going to talk about it anymore."
96,61,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.if you wear a mask outside or in your car alone your gullible and submissive not traits you want to project if you wear a mask outside or in your car alone your gullible and submissive not traits you want to project.
61,8,"I had a hard time breathing with the obliteration technique a few years ago, and was frightened by it (though, of course it is a very different type of mask from wearing a mask in the car) and it was so painful to go in the car and breathe with my hands."
61,9,"ah, the nutjobs."
61,13,">Why do people think you are gullible and submissive? Is it just to say that, no one wants to hear that."
61,34,"I think it is just to say that, no one wants to hear that."
61,51,"It's called the ""moask to be vaccinated and let us get that to you ""."
66,61,"A lot of people think wearing a mask is the best way to stop the spread of a virus. It is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. If you don't want to do that, do it! It seems he is being completely disrespectful and that's just not the way to do it."
71,61,"> I hate when the CDC calls people stupid when they don t have mandates, but I like the way people say you can t do it, you cant do it for the same reasons."
87,61,This is the same joke that happened with this movie and is also an attempt to have a conversation.
96,61,"This has no bearing on any person. You wear a mask that is not as effective as it used to be. You do not wear a helmet that you wouldn't wear in a public place, as the NSA can't systematically protect you."
61,8,">Why do people think you are gullible and submissive? Is it just to say that, no one wants to hear that. I think it is just to say that, no one wants to hear that."
61,9,I think OP is being completely disrespectful and that's just not the way to do it.

61,34,You are being disrespectful and that's just not the way to do it. A lot of people think wearing a mask is the best way to stop the spread of a virus.
61,51,I just can't stand being asked to wear a mask when I'm wearing a mask to prevent a viral infection and to prevent the spread of it.
66,61,i just can't imagine being an American who screams at a man who was going through a war
71,61,"I don't like that the CDC calls people stupid when they don't have mandates, but I think that's more a'my opinion is'that someone who has a senile virus is a ""misogynist"" than a ""good human being."" It's a very hard, unscientific opinion."
87,61,So... What would you do when you get home? Why don't you just sit on the sofa and make a joke?
96,61,This is about a mask that carries a virus. That's why there's a mask that can cover it.
61,8,"I think it's just to say that, no one wants to hear that. I think OP is being completely disrespectful and that's just not the way to do it."
61,9,"People always come at the president with a mask, they tell him to do it. There's also a bunch of people who are a bit grumpy when they call them a stupid idiot."
61,13,I think it is very important to remember the importance of a mask. There's a lot of frightened 'depressed' people in the media who've been talking about vaccinating people in the past.
61,34,"Why did you get a doctor? The CDC just does it, and you should have one. The problem is people with the same type of symptoms can get away with everything."
61,51,I don't think there is a joke with that.
66,61,"I think the article is pretty good but there is a lot of detail on it, a lot of the scenes involving Donald J. Trump are too short. A man a man of my word covid."
71,61,"I think you need to read the article, a syllable of the same title and then re-read it. I think it may be more helpful to keep a sense of context in your comments....and not only do you like football as much as I do, but also have a better understanding of how the game affects people, even if they aren't in their own right."
87,61,I don't understand what you mean by that.

61,34,"We're on to something. I hate this guy, but he's a pathetic dick, and he's so mad at him."
61,51,"The joke was made because the CDC didn't have mandates to get vaccines, and they only wanted to get the doctors to make sure that the vaccines wore off properly. But I think that was the CDC's responsibility, and his not being a good health care provider."
66,61,You're a man a man of your word.
71,61,"I mean, I really do like it, but what the guys doing aren't doing anything to stop it."
87,61,"I'm not a huge fan of the notion of wearing a mask, but this joke strikes me as a weird one."

66,61,You can't afford a mask.
71,61,"It's called an ""epoch."""
87,61,I just wanted to add that I just didn't understand it until I read the title and listened to all the comments on here.
96,61,"That isn't the sort of person who's in any way supposed to be a coach, and thus doesn't want to be a coach. It's the kind of person that does it for the living and not for the professional games."
61,8,"We don't know where the CDC says ""they didn't have mandates to get vaccines"" and it doesn't say anything about why it's ""ineffective"" to have a mask."
61,9,"There's no right or wrong or wrong way to do it and I can't see the issue with it being an attempt to say, you're a dick, you're a bit overreacting, it is the CDC, the NSA, and others."
61,13,You are the only one who can explain this to the person who asked about it and that you do not want to know about it?
61,34,"The person in question is the one that is most likely to be criticized by the entire community as a ""delusion""."
61,51,"""I can't stand being asked to wear a mask when I'm wearing a mask to prevent a viral infection and to prevent the spread of it."""
66,61,"The fact that he is wearing a mask is a huge red flag for me. It's a bit odd, but the government is a very good anti-virus. The US government is vetoing a vaccine. It is a violation of our constitutional rights. You are just a troll."
71,61,Is this some sort of joke about a senile virus?
87,61,The word mask is being used by a lot of people in a sense.
96,61,This is a big deal.
61,8,"I think it's just to say that, no one wants to hear that. I think OP is being completely disrespectful and that's just not the way to do it."""

61,34,CANNOTANSWER has a great piece about this.
61,51,"You're a pathetic dick, and I don't think there is a joke with that."
66,61,A lot of people think wearing a mask is the best way to stop the spread of a virus.
71,61,"I'm not saying that it's a joke, but I'm referencing what you're describing in your title. That's what it means."
87,61,"As a doctor, I can say I've read a few different people wearing masks, but most of them have gotten their own masks. I've been there."
96,61,I can't believe that OP is still a coach.
61,8,That is a pretty good way of putting it.
61,9,"CANNOTANSWER: ''You're a pathetic dick, and I don't think there is a joke with that''."
61,13,When I worked at a university I had to wear a mask because I was sick of being a clown and I was constantly kicking myself for wearing it and I was so embarrassed I couldn't even talk about it.
61,34,"I don't think you should be calling your coach ""a delusional dick"""
61,51,"It's a bit odd to say that, but it's a huge red flag. The fact that he is wearing a mask is a huge red flag for me."
66,61,"We need to look into the whole ACA. We need to be able to stop this issue before we go into the next one. We need to go back to work, and there is not much you can do. We need to do something we haven't been able to control, or be able to handle, and go from there. We should be able to get all of these things under control to the next."
71,61,"The people wearing the masks that are used are narcissistic. I don't know about any examples, but in general I'd think they'd be funny if someone was just sitting there doing nothing that made me uncomfortable."
87,61,"I think that if you like the idea of wearing a mask in public, you need to wear a mask to save people. Then just walk into a store and make sure nobody wants to see you. It would be a bad idea if someone did that."
96,61,"CANNOTANSWER, CANNOTANSWER'S INJURY WAS OVER THE ASSESSMENT OF A CHILD. I'd love to see a picture of a fullback with a mask in his helmet."
61,8,I think the people in the picture that are wearing masks should be doing so. That's a good way of putting it.
61,9,I'm an advocate for removing the government's involvement in preventing the spread of the virus.
61,13,The fact that he is wearing a mask is a huge red flag.
61,34,The fact that he is wearing a mask is a huge red flag.
61,51,"It's an obvious flaw in the ACA, and it's incredibly disrespectful."

71,61,"I'm not sure you are a ""superfan"" but you've clearly never read the title of the article. It's not a satire."
87,61,"Its a joke. The word mask has a name - ""hammer blazing all over your face"""
96,61,"I don't think the only thing I see about the ""masked"" thing is that the masked man is actually a coach. It's one thing to know a spooky head masked like a man who's huge pro athlete, and another to be the biggest advocate for the health system."
61,8,"He's a racist, isn't he?"
61,9,"I think the question being asked is ""What kind of mask would he be wearing and are they wearing?"" />"
61,13,This CANNOTANSWER is very similar to how you're describing a person who has been told that they should wear a mask if they can't feel them.
61,34,"It's not a ""smoking on my mask"" thing. It's a very real and serious thing."
61,51,I'm not an attorney nor am I a lawyer. I'm a doctor.
66,61,A lot of the troll comments in the wiki post are about the vaccine issue. They are about the ax vetoed veto and vetoed a vaccine in order to keep the problem in check.
71,61,"I'm not saying you are a ""superfan"" but I don't think that the phrase ""my opinion is that someone who has a senile virus is a ""misogynist"" than a ""good human being."" is a joke. Hence I think it's more a ""my opinion is"""
87,61,"I think it's a funny, funny, and well received joke. It's a very short one."
96,61,"When I was a kid, the guy had his head masked in order to make it look like a mask. He would ask ""Are you a bad boy or a good guy"" and he would say ""Yes, this spooky head is a good thing."" Then he got a job as a fullback and was asked to get one in order to make it more effective in preventing the spread of the virus."
61,8,"This is a joke. I think the comment above, ""How do you think people think you are gullible and submissive? Is it just to say that, no one wants to hear that."" is quite funny and it's a good one."
61,9,It's not a joke. It's just an utterly silly comment that seems very cliche. The way you describe it is incredibly unoriginal and kind of dickish. If you think that a mask would be a joke it's because he had the brains to make it sound like he was being masked because he's not a good human being and is the one who wants to see the details of this.
61,13,>I'm an advocate for removing the government's involvement in preventing the spread of a virus.
61,34,"I was an attorney and was a doctor on a team in which the team had a senile virus. I've been to several sports in the USA and the best coach I've ever worked for is a big, bad, and highly respected one who isn't very nice. That's a great point and the CDC is great at telling you about what it does."
61,51,"As a parent who has a medical degree and has been a lawyer, I see no reason to doubt my abilities. I'm not a lawyer. It seems like the op wants to be that kind of guy. You are not going to get it. I'm a doctor."

96,61,This isn't about his injury. This is about how much I dislike coaching (though not necessarily my opinion) and the kind of person that is trying to prevent the spread of a virus.
61,8,It's a joke.
61,9,"I can relate to this: People call the President a nutjob and when they say he is a nutjob, it is a joke, it is like saying ""I don't understand the whole story"" which is a bit of a ripoff."

61,9,Aaaaaand he got fired for not using his own mask. Aaand the whole thing is a joke.
61,13,The president's being a sleazy troll.
61,34,"I'm not sure what the CDC's definition of a joke is. I can't imagine a joke where someone is asked to get a mask or a doctor and is called ""a delusional dick"" because the CDC is trying to help protect their citizens from the diseases they are trying to prevent. It is more like saying ""If I can't do it then I need to get a doctor."" or ""I can't do it"". Or ""I can't even put a mask on my face""."
61,51,I'm not a lawyer. My family does not have the money to buy a house that does not have a vaccine. I've had children who got a sick infection and now are a little kid.

66,61,I feel like you should watch this movie in a way that combines all of these issues and has nothing to do with any of these things.
71,61,This has nothing to do with the virus. Vaccines are not health issues. They are not a shit word. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of the virus.
87,61,"In my experience, people are often forced to have a mask to keep their people safe, and when they do, they say that they have trouble keeping their hands soiled and put a mask on. That's when they get into trouble."
96,61,What's the point of this article? Why would it help people get into sport?
61,8,"A doctor allegedly made a movie with people that were wearing masks to prevent the spread of the virus from spreading. The movie makes him appear to be a racist.

61,34,It is a very common joke.
61,51,This is a joke. The CDC had the duty to make sure that the vaccines were wore off properly.
66,61,"> I don't think a lot of people in this sub are just trying to justify this. Vaccines are not health issues. They are not health issues. They have said a lot of things about Obama and that the administration needs to ""move the needle"" to a solution that reflects the current problems."
71,61,This is not the way to stop the spread of the virus. Vaccines are not health issues. They are not a shit word. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of a virus.
87,61,"I'd rather a people walk around with a mask than get in trouble because I don't know how to walk in a hat? Because, you know, you're a doctor and you gotta be a doctor."
96,61,"CANNOTANSWER is the first of many to mention that the NSA is taking responsibility for ""spooky and cruel"" incidents that affect people."
61,8,"CANNOTANSWER said that he feels that the ""spooky and cruel"" things he says are the kind of things he has to say when he hasn't done so yet."
61,9,"The mask isn't about him being a racist, it's about preventing the spread of the virus."
61,13,The movie is a comedy about the NSA's role in the spread of the virus. I wonder how much of the rape is gonna happen if we don't fuck the president.
61,34,CANNOTANSWER'S INJURY WAS OVER THE ASSESSMENT OF A CHILD. I love coaching however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops.
61,51,>I'm not an attorney nor am I a lawyer. I'm a doctor.
66,61,">I’m not a doctor, I’m a health care professional. I’m not a doctor. I’m not a doctor. I’m not a doctor. I’m not a doctor."
71,61,"A lot of people make jokes like this all the time, but not just because they get it, but because they actually actually believe it and they feel smug about it. I mean, I've heard the ""smoking on the record"" or that the phrase ""being sexist"" is pretty funny, because it makes you feel so uncomfortable. It's just a nice way to give people a sense of humor because it's something that they don't really feel comfortable with, but just don't let others."
87,61,I've seen the movie and its about the people. It's a great movie for all of us to watch.
96,61,"Why is this a prank? Are you a politician? If you are a politician, are you a politician?"
61,8,It sounds to me like this is just a prank about the administration and is about Obama being a racist. It is about him being racist and that does not mean that he is a racist and that the president is just a jerk
61,9,"It's not about him being racist, it's about preventing the spread of the virus."
61,13,CANNOTANSWER'S INJURY WAS OVER THE ASSESSMENT OF A CHILD.
61,34,I'm a politician and I'm a doctor. I'm not a doctor but I can't be a doctor.
61,51,"If this is a prank, that is exactly it. It is about the CDC preventing the spread of the virus."
66,61,"""Cannotanyanwer is the author of a book called ""Chilli's List. I just wanted to make sure. The author isn't going to change the facts because he's already been told about the ACA veto. The author is clearly in a coma with the trolls. This movie is about the trolls, the masks, the haters."""
71,61,"''Like I said, it's probably going to be funny to the people who know how to write in a satire about this and they are doing it in some way to make them feel uncomfortable.''"
87,61,"People get into trouble for wearing a mask for some reason, and people don't know what the jibs are."
96,61,It's not a prank.
61,8,"Is the president a racist, and can they make a prank about it?"
61,9,CANNOTANSWER and Rick Steiney are the trolls in this movie.
61,13,There's no reason why he's doing something like that.
61,34,"A bunch of people who aren't even in school, like Obama, have a ""Pizza & Muffin"" and are really excited for this movie."
61,51,"""I want to talk about this. I will veto any vaccine or vaccine I want."""
66,61,CANNOTANSWER and RICHARD STEIGNEY are the trolls in this film.
71,61,">You can be a health activist, and that's why the government does not mandate you to wear a mask. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of a virus."
87,61,"People get into trouble for wearing a mask for some reason, and people don't know what the jibs are. A few lines from the joke and you're going to have to say that: A lot of people are like this because of a lack of knowledge on how to wear a mask, but the truth is people do it for fun."
96,61,That was one of my favorite movies of all time.
61,8,"There is no way that I can make a prank about any person, but you can make a joke about anything. It sounds to me like this is just a prank about the CDC. It is about the CDC preventing the spread of the virus."
61,9,"I don't know, but it is actually a really good movie. The story is very interesting."
61,13,The president needs to put his mask on first because he doesn't think people are crazy to him. So he should wear a mask and get vaccinated.
61,34,"My friend, at a high school, taught me to be a doctor and was called a troll by his wife while she was in school. She said she never realised it was a prank. I could barely believe it, and it wasn't a joke. I had heard this as a joke about my friends."
61,51,"I feel like this is a joke, too. I haven't seen that movie, but it sounds like a fun movie. It was very informative."
66,61,CANNOTANSWER and Richard Steigeney are the trolls in this movie.

87,61,"I think it's a prank. Because people are a bit different, but not exactly exactly the same."
96,61,What's a prank? Because I love fucking hockey.
61,8,"""Richard Steiney is the troll in this movie. I think it's just a joke."
61,9,"It sounds like the CDC is trying to make you aware of the true meaning behind the mask. I mean, it's possible that he is a racist, and that a joke is not enough to stop a dick from expressing his views as an activist."
61,13,CANNOTANSWER is the troll in this movie.

61,51,They're bringing a prank to a film where they put a mask on a black guy who's not wearing a mask to prevent a viral infection and prevent the spread of a virus.

87,61,CANNOTANSWER: The man in the blue moon is a funny movie.
96,61,"""[I have a feeling that] I'll be a good coach in the long run."
61,8,"It's a fun movie. The guy wearing a mask who is actually a troll at first, then a troll a bit later. I can't wait to watch that movie."
61,9,A man in the blue moon is funny.
61,13,"It's interesting, as it's actually a comedy movie. I have heard a lot of pranks about the CDC. A few of them actually are really funny. I was going to watch it but found a guy who doesn't wear a mask to prevent his illness and said that it's probably a prank."
61,34,"If you like hockey, then this is a good movie."
61,51,"The CDC is not going to change the name of the movie, because they have a lot of things to consider. The President could be talking about this on his Facebook page. It was not an actual joke he was talking about."
66,61,The author is clearly in a coma with the trolls.
71,61,"So, what you just said is the best way to stop the spread of a virus."
87,61,"It's probably an excellent movie, but i think it would be funny to keep the people in the audience laughing at it, because it's a good way to bring up the issue."
96,61,"""I love coaching however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops. i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops."","
61,8,It's really an effective way to keep the audience laughing at it.
61,9,So the president is wearing a mask in a movie about the president?
61,13,CANNOTANSWER is the troll in this movie.
61,34,CANNOTANSWER:
61,51,"You're a pathetic dick, but you can't stand a CDC prank."
66,61,I am not a lawyer. The author is not a lawyer.
71,61,"""...and I don't think it is a joke,"""
87,61,"As a doctor who had worked with some of the heists in my family for nearly 10 years, it was my job to help them emasculate the disease. They went through some tough times deciding to wear a mask and trying to keep themselves safe, but still being able to do it to stay safe was a lot of work."
96,61,"It's a joke, but a joke. It's not a joke. It's not a prank. It's not a joke."
61,8,And he isn't an asshole for being a racist and not really an asshole for being an asshole. I think it is very effective for this movie.
61,9,...and he's not a lawyer. The author is not a lawyer. The way you describe it is incredibly unoriginal and kind of dickish.
61,13,There's no reason to ignore this movie.
61,34,CANNOTANSWER said the president could have called this a joke. '...and I didn't care about them. They're just an act of kindness. They're not funny.
61,51,It's not a prank. It's a joke.
66,61,You troll. I'm not sure what to call you.
71,61,Its a good joke. The first part is very true.
87,61,"The movie reveals the true meaning of the movie and the reason for it. I don't think it's funny because people seem to assume it is a joke, but if I had to guess it would be a joke."
96,61,"It's not a joke, but a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke, but a joke. It's a joke."
61,8,I don't think they can do anything about it.
61,9,It's a great movie. I thought this was a fun way to imply it was a joke.
61,13,"It seems that the author of this article is snarking at the notion that the CDC is a scumbag. That being said, if a troll tells you that it's not funny because he doesn't want to be a troll, you don't know that a joke is a joke. Hence the title."
61,34,"It's a joke, but it's not a joke."
61,51,Its a joke. Its a joke.
66,61,"I’m not saying the ACA is a bad idea or that it is a good idea, but I would be more worried about Trump wearing a mask to hide his illness. This isn’t something to be pranks about, and the ACA doesn’t make sense to me."
71,61,"As you've said, I don't like [The President has to wear a mask. We should all wear masks and get vaccines in order to prevent AIDS from developing. Vaccines are not a health issue."
87,61,"""I think it's funny."""
96,61,You seem to be missing the whole point of 'if you love hockey but the people that are in it get me mad when they have to fuck around in their own cars and don't show up in the morning to get a mask on or even go through a bathroom window'.
61,8,The movie was actually directed by [Richard Steiney](http://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbythemiddlemen).
61,9,It's funny. It's a good joke.
61,13,You’re a ripoff.
61,34,"It's the movie, which makes me laugh out loud. The whole thing is so depressing to think that someone would like a joke when someone makes a joke about a sick child."
61,51,"The only time I can think of anything that would be funny is if the president called it a joke, because he is snarky and the guy said ""We don't know what that's about unless you see a doctor who is a doctor but can do it. You're not a lawyer."""
66,61,"A lot of people think wearing a mask is the best way to stop the spread of a virus. It is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. If you don't want to do it, do it!"

61,51,He's gonna be a ripoff.
66,61,I think this movie is a bit misleading.
71,61,The first part of the article is very true.

96,61,"I hate to be the hater, but I want to be a hockey coach as well. It's an activity I enjoy and play hockey, but I prefer to be a coach, so that I can work on my career."
61,8,The movie is funny and he can tell you that. He can't even tell you that he isn't racist. I don't like the premise but he's an asshole.
61,9,I don't see why this is a good question. I think it's a good example of what a nice person would say.
61,13,I think the wording of the article is misleading.
61,34,"I can't imagine this being a joke, I don't think it's really a joke. It's just a funny way to say it and makes people laugh. It's very funny."
61,51,">It's a great movie, it's funny. It's funny."
66,61,"OP, I thought the title was misleading, but I'm not a doctor or a doctor. I feel like people should not talk about the ACA and veto it without seeing how they are the trolls. Rather, I want to know what's happening with the ACA. This is the government vetoing it to stop people from going into the AIDS epidemic, not just the current health care system."

So, he's on an all-nighter on this shit. I love this movie."

96,61,I can't tell if you are wrong or I'm just a prankster. I think the word 'no' is wrong. That's why the guy got a mask in his car and told him to put on a mask in order to stop the spread of the virus.

61,51,"CANNOTANSWER: I hate this guy, but he's a pathetic dick, and he's so mad at him. The joke was made because the CDC didn't have mandates to get vaccines, and they only wanted to get the doctors to make sure that the vaccines wore off properly.
