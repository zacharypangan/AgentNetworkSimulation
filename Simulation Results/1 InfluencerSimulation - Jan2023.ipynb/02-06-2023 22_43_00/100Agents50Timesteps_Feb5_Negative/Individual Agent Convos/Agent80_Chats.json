    ">[The article is titled \"The President of the United States of America\"', \"The whole point of it all is to stop the spread of a virus. The apologist on r/religion has a post about it and he is probably not quite as knowledgeable as he seems. Rather, he has a very strong sense of humor and is a great speaker on the topic, and has an eye for r/religion and the fact that he likes to speak about this.\"",

    "He is the one being a little over the top, as he has the remorse and responsibilities of not making jokes and he doesn't want to hear from anyone and is a troll because of this.",
    "if he plays on the internet he can probably get into the NFL. if not he can get in the broncos - thats a deal breaker for sure.",
    "This is a really very simple topic. It is so silly and disgusting that even a professor can tell me to resign and not work there.",
    "''If the news isn't correct about it, that is pretty cool.''",
    "I'm going to see if a video is made of a joke about why a troll is not allowed to use a mask.",
    "I've always been a football coach and it helps me understand how to go about the world. Then again, I'm not a professor.",
    "I'm a football coach and i have never heard of a good coach. I do not really know anything about any of the things they've said or gotten across to me. What is your role at the club?",
    "A great coach is a good person. They can make jokes about them, or put them in the video. A good coach isn't a good coach. There aren't a lot of other jobs on the field for them, but they do make jokes about football players, and it's a good job of being a good one.",

    "I think you're really being sarcastic.",
    "I'm not sure why a person has a problem with a mask because a coach has a good sense of humor. It makes it more difficult for the players to stop using it.",
    "I've been told I was going to have to look at some of this for myself.",
    "I don't know how many people I know who don't wear a mask or a helmet, but I hear a lot of these things. I'm not sure if I'd want to see a movie of people in a mask or not.",
    "\"I just want to let you know, for me it\u2019s a lot of shit. I\u2019m going to tell you that if I don\u2019t, I won\u2019t even need a helmet.\"",

    "...and so, it's now a joke.",
    "A good coach isn\u2019t a good one. The president needs to change his policies to prevent the spread of AIDS."
