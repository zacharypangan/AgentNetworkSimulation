75,42,You have to wear your mask.
78,42,I know the public health in my county isn't working on that and i just saw the same comment here
79,42,the truth is that wearing a mask makes people breathe out of their heads
80,42,"They want the players to wear masks and throw a jab because of the economic problems i believe. Obviously, i can understand your frustration with them, but they also don't want them to have to worry about being able to use their taser on their teammates."

88,42,"This is very funny. I am a vaccinated person with boosters, and my best friend has two of them and he wears a mask. It is one of the more dangerous and effective ways to stop a virus."
90,42,"In other words, yes the newest strain is soooooo contagious just bc they have a mask on their hands pics don't mean they re using it"
94,42,"The best way to stop the spread of a virus is to wear a mask that is made of masks, not those that are designed for public health..."

42,41,"This is the most important part of the article, and it's the only one I can find that suggests this."
46,42,In my experience a mask is not a bad thing. You have to be in a different state.
50,42,"You're not just getting sick, you're getting a sick infection, you're getting sick and dying."
59,42,So you like being a doctor and you like being a doctor?

75,42,"The state doesn't have any mandates, and most state health departments don't like to wear any."
78,42,I think you're being sarcastic in the context of the first part.
79,42,Do you think a guy can be as good as a woman?
80,42,"It seems like the ""revolutionary government"" has a taser law to force players to wear a mask. It doesn't imply that it is something NSA can do or prevent, but they do so by forcing a decision based on their own convictions."
81,42,They don't want the people with masks sacked or sacked to have a job because they can't wear a mask because of the fear of a virus.
88,42,I would be mad if I were in a hospital where they don't want us doing anything.
90,42,They are not really going to save the people who wear a mask. That's very unfair.

97,42,Is this a joke a lot? I was wondering how you even got it to think that wearing a helmet is supposed to prevent any physical injuries.
42,27,"I think the reason why that was sarcastic was because this shit is so offensive. I figured you were merely saying something sarcastic, so that you would understand it."
42,29,I am not saying that a 'pills of a virus' is an excuse for wearing a mask.
42,41,I'm going to throw this into the conversation as if this guy is joking.
46,42,In my experience a mask is not a bad thing. You have to be in a different state.
50,42,The president is in the wrong.
59,42,I'd like to be able to say that I love the state of Georgia and have a lot of friends from here who are allergic to HIV.
60,42,"I mean, i understand how you feel, but i would not want a kid with a reversible disease who needs a mask, and therefore does not need to wear a mask."
63,42,"OP, this is part of a different sub for all of us."
69,42,The mask is used to protect you from a virus. I think they should make it illegal to use a weapon. I am also sure that there is a link where the trump mask is made to prevent them from getting the vaccine. I can't believe a guy on a TV station made that joke.
75,42,"I am a Vermonter so I don't see how this is a good idea, and I think that they have a lot of propaganda about the government."
78,42,This guy wears a mask all the time to fight cancer and his family.
79,42,"""Why do you think a man can be as good as a woman?"""
80,42,"I can see that not being able to use a mask for a narcissistic job, but you know, is probably one of the first things that comes to mind when you think about this... It sounds like you've learned that this kind of behavior is sexist."
81,42,The government is trying to stop people from getting viruses through their body. It is also trying to prevent people from getting HIV.
88,42,"It's very unlikely to occur in the U.S. that there is no mandate for TB and STIs coverage, or that it's a law to prevent TB transmission, but it might be a concern for CDC."
90,42,I'm not sure I'd have a good time if they weren't going to do the same.
94,42,[What is the problem? How do I make them look? Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of a virus. Please wear masks.
97,42,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.It is really a great thing that a man with a helmet can be in the NBA and still play. I love the idea of wearing a mask and I am glad that he does not play a lot. I'm a USN. I'm a USN.

42,41,I don't care how they make it to that point.
46,42,I'm gonna put up with a lot of ridiculous stuff in my head now that I'm not actually a doctor. Apparently the government isn't willing to do something that will save me from a lot of pain.
50,42,"A mask is a sign that you will pass it on when you reach the medical center. It's called ""I am a man of my word""."
59,42,"I mean, I wouldn't want to come to a hospital and get vaccinated. I'd rather have my friends stay in my home town and not wear a mask to avoid getting sick."
60,42,I don't know. You can't tell me.
63,42,"I am a little old to know the anti-virus laws and the government are designed to protect people from those threats. I have seen them come up all over the place, and some of them are very effective."
69,42,"It's all about the masks, not the vaccinations."
75,42,"We're having a lot of good debate on whether or not this is true. It sounds like the people who will be at TwitchCon would be dissuaded from attending, but there is a really good chance that they wouldn't be able to heed the suggestion, and would be able to work with the people in charge, for the long term. Obviously a mask doesn't guarantee a future vaccination, and it's pretty unlikely that you'll be able to go for the next two years for years."
78,42,"Yes. It's not like a joke, it's a joke."
79,42,How do you think a guy can be as good as a woman?
80,42,"I have heard of this before : ""The NSA is doing everything for national security. I love football, I love football - there is nothing illegal about being on the team or playing on the internet."

50,42,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
59,42,"What about this guy? I was wondering if he knew anything about it. I'm a member of Congress, and I'm in the USA."
60,42,"This isn't a real joke, it's actually an important one, and I just wanted to point out a bit about a good friend of mine who had a virus."
63,42,"I think the only thing that makes sense is that if they had to wear a mask and had a syringe and helmets on that day I'd be pretty fucking crazed. I'm sorry that I am getting downvoted. The government needs to do something about this, or they won't do it."
69,42,"> ""If you want order in america, president Donald J. Trump must take off his mask and turn himself in oh and every day he doesn't people will die starting tonight i m a man of my word covid"""
75,42,"""I've heard of folks who rebranded their masks like that - they're called 'fake viral masks'. It sounds like people think they need to wear them but think they don't have to."" It sounds like they're in the Swiss army. They don't even seem to realize that it's an actual virus."
78,42,"The point of ACA is to abolish it, even if it's not in effect."
79,42,You're not a racist or anything. This is a joke.
80,42,This is a good question. Is it sexist that you do not have to wear your mask.
81,42,>I just don't see why it's weird.
88,42,"Vaccines are not the right, you should not have to do it. The actual problem is how many people wear masks, and when it happens, they die."
90,42,I like the movie and I don't think it's a good idea to take a joke.
94,42,"This is a common misconception I've encountered in any public health situation - the lack of a health care provider who cares enough to do all of the right things without needing a mask. I'm interested in learning more about the people who wear masks, which is what emigration is, and what's important in your opinion."
97,42,This is a really bad guy who is in the shady mentality of the president.

42,29,>I'm going to throw this into the conversation as if this guy is joking.
42,41,CANNOTANSWER'S THE MEAT
46,42,"The people who have HIV that he hasn't got in a reversible disease already don't have to be vaccinated. It's not the disease, but the way the CDC feels about the disease."
50,42,"No, I'm not suggesting that the government is bad, it's the fact that the govt is."
59,42,"I love the government, but there are things the president has been trying to cover up recently that need to be changed."
60,42,"It's a prank, but it's an important one."
63,42,">I'm in the middle of a bunch of sick children, i'm reading about it in a wiki article. And when the NCAA is involved, the head mask thing is a joke. It's called the ""Dad, you need a helmet, you have a helmet."" It's not a stupid idea. I'd have to read the whole thing if I was an athlete. I love the movie, but I am hesitant to watch it unless I find myself reading something that isn't in the wiki article."
69,42,"This is very controversial, and I'm a pro-veteran."
75,42,"It seems like you have never seen the movie The Simpsons but you have the same gist as him, I don't even know if it has the genus that they're referring to. I mean, the president and some of his allies should have no problem being in it."
78,42,"Yes, it's a joke."
79,42,"There are lots of other things that are pretty similar. I mean, if you are into a fucking war, and the government is getting out of control, it is a pretty big problem. It could be a lot worse. It might even be a very good thing to have a more progressive version of the military."
80,42,"Well, y'know, I hate that stuff. It's a crime to not wear a mask, but you can do it anyway, even if they are not allowed to."
81,42,There are so many people here in America that actually don't even wear masks. I know there isn't one.
88,42,"Vaccines are not the right, you should not have to do it. Vaccines are not the right, you should not have to do it. The problem is that there is no evidence of people getting vaccinated. That's why I am afraid that the government could've just done that instead."
90,42,I read that the people describing it supposedly had in the movie and thought it was the ACA. It's one of the worst things to happen in America.
94,42,"It doesn't make sense to make the cops a cop, it's just one of the ways to get rid of the police. As a government employee I know that this is the case in most cases and I'm not sure why, but he has his own problems to be aware of."
97,42,">I think the other commenters are pointing out that ''this is not a joke. It's a great book about a guy who slammed his post into his head, like a real guy who was a pro game coach. Isn't the head mask part of the system? This is a really bad guy who is in the shady mentality of the president.''"
42,27,That's so hard to understand.
42,29,"I'm a lawyer with a doctor's degree in health care, and I was never able to get an infection."
42,41,It's a joke. A prank is a joke.
46,42,"Why do you think wearing a mask is good, even if you live in another state? It's not really a good idea, and is not the first step."
50,42,I was vaccinated twice and I didn't take a picture. I guess it's the biggest problem for the US economy to keep a virus.
59,42,"I think that the government is trying to cover up this because it is the only thing that works. Is there a difference between using a mask to prevent this and a person who doesn't wear a mask? I would say yes, and the reason this apologists are trying to hide is because the people with HIV and their allergies are more likely to not be vaccinated."
60,42,"if you wear a mask, you are going to be a hero. This is a great example of a great movie. I'm not sure what you have seen, but I enjoy watching this movie as a great example of the ACA."
63,42,"I feel like most people who hate wearing a mask are really young, who are so inexperienced."
69,42,"I think the whole post is a little funny because the wiki article is actually a link to the article. Basically the wiki article is pointing out how they can make it illegal to use a weapon. So, you're still confused and it's a pretty basic premise to make a premise of this, i.e. that's why they said they want a vaccine for anyone that isn't currently in the US who has a fever, but that a lot of people have been infected with a mask and that would be a"
75,42,"This is actually a really good question. It is a good one because you have to be vaccinated to do this, and you need to be in the field for as long as possible. I would never go to an AIDS related hospital. If you have a medical condition, you need to be vaccinated. The government isn't the only source of AIDS to help spread it."
78,42,The ACA is supposed to be a joke. It's not about the mask.
79,42,i'm just not sure how a movie would do this.
80,42,"This post isn't the type of post where they aren't being real about what's going on, and they aren't even trying."
81,42,">I'm going to see the movie I'm a man: Why is the guy wearing a mask a threat to America? I'd have to say, that I don't really understand how that is necessary."
88,42,"It's also worth noting that people in this sub are asking to be informed of the actual facts of the situation to avoid being considered a ""disaster."""
90,42,"I think we all agree that a mask would have some sort of moral hazard, and it would probably be the best way to make a positive difference if it wasn't just a mask."
94,42,"It's important to wear a mask in order to be able to respond to the virus. In this situation it's very important to wear a mask and a mask. This is just an observation. The answer to this isn't 'what you're saying', but with what you are saying. You're interested in learning more about the people who wear masks, which is what emigration is, and what's important in your opinion.'"
97,42,"This is a lot of sarcastic comments and I'm not a liberal, but I read a lot of stuff and it just doesn't feel that way. I think we need to do something about it."
42,27,">I think the other commenters are pointing out that ''this is not a joke. It's a great book about a guy who slammed his post into his head, like a real guy who was a pro game coach. Isn't the head mask part of the system?"
42,29,">I'm a lawyer with a doctor's degree in health care, and I was never able to get an infection. It's a joke."
42,41,"The fact that there are people who wear masks in public because they are ill in a sense is also a serious problem. It would be a great way to explain why you like it, but I'm not sure how I could explain that to a human being."
46,42,"I don't know about the CDC, but I don't know much about the AIDS outbreak."
50,42,"CANNOTANSWER: I don't get why the CDC should tell a kid that they don't have to wear a mask if they are on a sports team. That's my favorite part, that's why a lot of people don't want to wear a mask."
59,42,There is no denying that the NSA is trying to cover up this because they have gotten to know the people who get vaccinated. But it's very much a joke.
60,42,"A lawmaker in my state, who didn't have the right to wear a medical mask, told me that he would be a hero."
63,42,"I mean, if the NSA did that to the athletes (that's like a big bang, the kids who fought the syringe wouldn't go anywhere, they would never know what was going on there), then the people in the NCAA would be crazy about it."
69,42,The CDC and the CDC are the only agencies involved in the AIDS research. They were there.
75,42,You are referring to the president.
78,42,I'm not a doctor so I wouldn't say the ACA is a joke unless it's about the mask.
79,42,I was able to find an article on a news network on a recent project by a woman at a church in a university of Texas.
80,42,"If they are going to ban any kind of fad, then fads aren't a big deal. If they are, I think it would be ridiculous to ban the NSA entirely without the help of a private company."
81,42,The NSA is trying to prevent HIV transmission and I don't know where that's coming from. I read somewhere that it's more about people wearing masks.
88,42,It's important to give a lot of people the chance to think they could have vaccinated themselves.
90,42,"I don't get why you have to go to the library, you don't even need to see the movie. It's an awful movie. The ACA and ACA itself are both great, but they're insufferable."
94,42,"[In addition to the comments on [https://www.ipc.gov/repair/repair/security/complaints/nasa_repair_lawyers-female_gov/]. It says a man in a hood is wearing a mask, which is part of the measures deployed by the NSA. It says a man in a hood is wearing a mask, which is part of the measures deployed by the government."
97,42,"I don't see why you're so concerned. If the news aren't correct, then you might be wrong. It's really just a generalization. This seems kind of absurd."
42,27,CANNOTANSWER:
42,29,I am in the same boat.
42,41,I don't know the context of this. I just don't understand what you're trying to say.
46,42,"The issue is not the government, it is the government itself. You have to wear the mask. The federal government has the right to refuse to do anything to keep people safe. But you don't have to give the person any of these hats."
50,42,"He had a lot of problems with the government, so he just was surprised that the CDC was so close to tackling him and not his actions. He has also had a very negative view on the health insurance system and he has some issues. It's really sad, and disgusting, that he can't just use a mask to protect himself if he wants."
59,42,"As long as you are a member of Congress, you have to be able to vote for the people who do not want to vote for the president."
60,42,RIP gov. s. 1:32
63,42,I don't think people wear masks as they do not work in this context.
69,42,I'm not sure if it's a joke or not.
75,42,In the context of the ACA.
78,42,There's just a couple of things you can get into about this.
79,42,>I have a few comments about it:
80,42,"I am not really a fan of the idea of a helmet but it's a great way to have a helmet. It is also a means to keep the government from threatening to bomb other people, or allowing people to have sex on the field."
81,42,"> We wear masks to fight the flu. I don't care who the title is, I think you know the issue."""
88,42,Vaccines and STIs are not health issues. Vaccines and STIs are not the same thing.
90,42,"I'm sure they're just trying to get a shitjob, and they're not right."
94,42,The video is called [https://www.ipc.gov/repair/repair/security/complaints/nasa_repair_lawyers-female_gov/]. The NSA has been working pretty hard to prevent the spread of a virus.
97,42,"That doesn't sound very funny to me, actually."
42,27,People make fun of each other.
42,29,They were just trying to be funny by giving a bunch of other comments about his lack of understanding of the context of the law.
42,41,I've been watching a video where a guy wearing a mask and the government is using it to stop the spread of the virus is so sick that he's able to wear a mask. I don't understand why that's a joke.
46,42,CANNOTANSWER IS A HONORABLE TAX MAN. He has to take responsibility and protect others.
50,42,"""'Putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i've ever done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things."""

80,42,So basically the NSA is working to stop a virus from circulating around America.
81,42,"As someone who has had HIV, I want to point out that the president has been using a mask to prevent the spread of the virus.This is a joke. The idea of wearing a mask is sexist and inappropriate."
88,42,"Is it possible to prevent an outbreak and still be able to get people sick without getting vaccinated? Because I am sick and do not understand vaccines, and my husband is still vaccinated, so I am vaccinated in my area."
90,42,"The ACA and the ACA itself are both good, but they're insufferable."
94,42,Vaccination is a very dangerous and dangerous job. What do you think of this one?
97,42,I don't know if it was an actual joke or just an idea but it's pretty odd that a lot of people find this sort of thing absurd.
42,27,You have to ask yourself why it is so offensive.
42,29,"I'm a lawyer with a doctor's degree in health care, and I was never able to get an infection."
42,41,i think you are being a hero.
46,42,Because he's not a federal employee. So he's an unemployed asshole.
50,42,The president isn't in the right but he's in the right. The CDC isn't bad at addressing a problem with AIDS. The fact that it's a government problem does not change this.
59,42,There is nothing about the CIA or the NSA in Georgia.
60,42,RIP Bill W. & Mrs. D.
63,42,> I love the movie! I was in a movie with my dad. I love that movie!
69,42,The ACA doesn't matter if you're a doctor if they wear a mask. They're the only agencies involved in the AIDS research. They were there.
75,42,"I'm going to read this in a jar, because there's a lot of snark, and that I don't see it."
78,42,"... and to be clear, that was one of my favorites."
79,42,"""We wear masks to fight the flu."
80,42,I genuinely think it would be absurd to ban the NSA because it will put a huge amount of pressure on the civilian population to carry it.
81,42,">As someone who has had HIV, I want to point out that the president has been using a mask to prevent the spread of the virus.This is a joke. The idea of wearing a mask is sexist and inappropriate. The idea of wearing a mask is sexist and inappropriate."
88,42,"We need more CDC to go around this problem, because it seems like we can't afford to go afoul of them as we need them to fuck."
90,42,What about the ACA? It's a really good movie!
94,42,It's just one of the very few public health things that the NSA does that s in any way at the top of their list. But it's a great idea.
97,42,"I think the other commenters are pointing out that ''this is not a joke. It's a great book about a guy who slammed his post into his head, like a real guy who was a pro game coach. Isn't the head mask part of the system? This is a really bad guy who is in the shady mentality of the president.''"" I think the other commenters are pointing out that ''this is not a joke."
42,27,He's the President and that's the problem.
42,29,"I think this is one of the many reasons to have a doctor's degree. I am not saying that the mask is bad, but it's a really good idea. You have to ask yourself why it is so off-putting."
42,41,I think we need a govt. to take action to address the problem.
46,42,"Vaccines are not the right, he should not have to do it. He is being a tyrant about not doing anything that would protect him, and he doesn't want to deal with this in the same way that other people do."
50,42,I'm a bit confused by what it sounds like in the article. I don't know where it comes from.
59,42,"I feel you, I'm pretty sure this article is about a problem not a cure. There are other issues that can't be corrected."
60,42,"If it is not the CDC, it is not a prank."
63,42,"I was watching the movie on Netflix yesterday, I was like ""Always trying to find the movie but I can't find it anywhere. I don't know where I live, but it is something you have to understand."" I thought that the movie was about the NSA's role in protecting victims of the anti-virus movement, and they have put in a documentary about it. I also heard that the film is in the top 4 movies in the nation."
69,42,CANNOTANSWER: The ACA doesn't matter if you're a doctor if they wear a mask. They're the only agencies involved in the AIDS research. They were there.
75,42,Vaccines can prevent people from getting sick from eating anything.
78,42,"Yes, it is a joke. It's supposed to be a joke. It's a joke."
79,42,Why are these jokes the most hated in this thread?
80,42,I was in an interview with a former coach once who was a coach. It was actually quite good. It's not sexist that they didn't make the right choice. That's the point.
81,42,"The president of the US is trying to help combat the epidemic, but he's ignoring the fact that it has been going on since 1945. We've just seen that he is not in a govt position yet and it hasn't changed."
88,42,>I feel like a bunch of these idiots just feel that they should stop going to public schools and get the vaccine.
90,42,"> ""We're not really going to save the people who wear a mask. That's very unfair."""
94,42,>Is it about the NSA. Is it about the NSA or about her job in a CIA office?
97,42,"I hated this one, but I also hated this post, too. The point is that the author's name is a little in reference to the book. It is an excellent read, but I don't see a good reason to be so concerned, but the article did mention the President of the US, and that he is a great coach. I hated this post, but I thought that was a bad idea and that the guy's name is a good way to express his thoughts about this issue. It wasn't that we don't do something about it."
42,27,I can understand why you are being off-putting.
42,29,"You could be one of those people that sees people who can't afford to pay to get a health insurance because they've been diagnosed with HIV, and 'infection' is one of the most serious issues that you may have, that makes you sick."
42,41,I'm just trying to understand if this is a joke or a prank.
46,42,">The issue is not the government, it is the government itself. You have to wear the mask. The federal government has the right to refuse to do anything to keep people safe. But you don't have to give the person any of these hats."
50,42,The CDC is trying to stop the spread of AIDS. The CDC is making fun of him for not being able to get vaccinated. The CDC is trying to prevent a large number of people from being vaccinated. They are allowing people to go to the doctor without insurance. They are doing nothing to stop the spread of AIDS. The CDC is trying to prevent a large number of people from being vaccinated. They are allowing people to go to the doctor without insurance. They are doing nothing to stop the spread of AIDS.
59,42,It's funny that I had the same sort of reaction to an article I read where a doctor said that wearing a mask helps you get away from a cold and the government tells you to avoid putting your face in the heat and not to use it. But no one cared about the situation and they would never get vaccinated.
60,42,I agree with the other commenters.
63,42,What is this movie about? What's the story?
69,42,"It's a CIA conspiracy. The ACA is in fact a terrorist organization. So if they do not change their mind and make it illegal to use a weapon, there is a chance there will be a terrorist threat to this country."
75,42,Vaccines are an incredibly important and effective tool for preventing the spread of AIDS.
78,42,>I read that the ACA is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. I read that it is a joke and is being put in place because it is a joke and it does not address the issue of preventing the spread of a virus. I read that the ACA is a joke and is being put in place because it is a joke and it does not address the issue of preventing the spread of a virus. I read that it is a joke and is being put in place because it is a joke and
79,42,Its not just a joke. You're being rude too. You have no idea how you're going to take a joke in a joke thread.
80,42,"""It seems like the ""revolutionary government"" has a taser law to force players to wear a mask. It doesn't imply that it is something NSA can do or prevent, but they do so by forcing a decision based on their own convictions."""
81,42,The idea of wearing a mask to prevent the spread of the virus is a joke. The idea of wearing a mask to prevent the spread of the virus.
88,42,The people on the CDC are acting like idiots. They're actually doing a very good job of avoiding a problem like TB/STIs.
90,42,I agree that it is an awful movie. The ACA is a great thing. But the ACA is a great way to prevent AIDS.
94,42,I can't even imagine any more of the problems in this situation. I'm an employee and when I see the image I want to go get a real one....I really want to be a police officer.
97,42,It is pretty funny that a lot of people find this sort of thing absurd.
42,27,The first two parts of this thread are a little off.
42,29,"I just read a shitload of stuff about the CDC's ""snooping masks"" and the ""fucking a lot of these people in there."""
42,41,"I read that the ACA has been passed to prevent people from getting vaccinated, and it is going to be adopted by every govt. office in the country. I'm very interested in what this is about and what they think of it."
46,42,"They're also trying to convince a lot of people that a vaccine is not good to protect people, and that the ACA is bad for them and they need to do more than just the same."
50,42,It sounds like they're trying to be a satire of the book that is the same as the one in The Spectre.
59,42,"I want a mask and I want a government that does not give me any reason to believe that I'm not being abused by someone, as they say they are not. I'm very proud of them and I've never seen an incompetent politician."
60,42,This is the best example of a great movie.
63,42,"if you want to say something like ""I hate the idea of Trump being told to put off the mask. I think that ''Say what you want'' is the best way to go about it."
69,42,The whole topic is about the ACA. There is a CIA conspiracy. The CIA is working together to prevent the spread of HIV.
75,42,I've heard that the President and some of his allies should have no problem with going to the CDC or the CDC.
78,42,It's also a joke because the ACA is only used to prevent spread of HIV. It's a joke because it's a joke.
79,42,I feel like that's a little ridiculous.
80,42,It's also not a crime to not wear a mask.
81,42,"A couple of my friends who have HIV are getting a hat for a show called ""The Masked Man"" and this guy said he is in no way a hat, because of his lack of masks, and it's the latest sign of a bad idea he can have for anyone who's seen the movie."
88,42,"It's a satire of the book, but I believe it is a funny one."
90,42,"""Alright, there's a way to fix this. It's so easy to talk about the ACA when it's a really good idea. The whole thing seems to be blaming the 'police' and people having no interest in what that means. It's all about being a sexist troll."""
94,42,"I'm a woman, and I don't think I've read any of the comments so far that were in the wrong place. I just wanted to say that I think it's really a good idea. But I also don't think that wearing a mask is a good idea to do something like that if I do anything with the government. And I think if you don't like it, you are going to look into getting one of these things and then find the person who is actually trying to stop it. But then you want to think that's a really good"
97,42,"It's a generalization. That's really just a joke and I don't see why you're so concerned. If the news aren't correct, then it's pretty absurd."
42,27,CANNOTANSWER: [I love the idea of wearing a mask and I am glad that he does not play a lot.''
42,29,I'd really like to wear a mask in public. My job is to get a real one.
42,41,"No. If they haven't passed the ACA, why is there still not a lot of room for the government to take action?"
46,42,The ACA isn't a valid defense of the healthcare system.
50,42,Vaccines are an equal measure of protection. They are good at stopping it. The only thing I would do is to take my doctor for a walk.
59,42,People are expressing a rage at the president for wearing a mask.
60,42,You're the one who should do the best you can and tell us what a great movie it is.
63,42,Is there anything else I can do to help you?
69,42,... [CNN] is in the US.
75,42,"I know I can be a bit harsh but I can understand why he will feel uncomfortable when he wears masks. They don't help the people, they help the disease. They're not a government entity and it's only a government agency. The CDC can do very little but it doesn't mean it is incompatible with the ACA. It means that you'll never be able to go."
78,42,... It's just a joke because it's a joke. It's a joke because it isn't meant to be a joke.
79,42,"I feel like if I were you I'd think he could make a movie about the AIDS epidemic, and just show him that he's going to keep this person alive."
80,42,"You're the president. You need to move on with your life, this is the President."
81,42,I have seen the movie before and I think it's fun to watch. This isn't about him getting a mask. This is about the gov't wanting to stop the spread of a virus.
88,42,Vaccines are not health issues. Vaccines and STIs are not the same thing.
90,42,I'm going to have to admit that I didn't mean to sound snarky. It was a very different kind of satire from the books.
94,42,"I don't think anyone in this sub has ever made any stance like the 'You're trying to get over the fact that I'm a woman who wears a mask, but instead I'm going to tell you that this video has nothing to do with what the NSA does."
97,42,I don't understand why the president should do this. He's not a leader. The president is not a leader. It's also a big deal that the players in the NFL are the only ones that are at fault for the AIDS problem. The whole point of it all is to stop the spread of a virus. The president is not a troll. The president is not a troll. The president is not a troll. No one is a troll. No one is a troll.
42,27,"It's a joke, as I've written before."
42,29,CANNOTANSWER: ''I love the idea of wearing a mask and I am glad that he does not play a lot. I'd really like to wear a mask in public. My job is to get a real one.
42,41,"I'm going to say, ""I've been watching a video where a guy wearing a mask and the government is using it to stop the spread of the virus is so sick that he's able to wear a mask."""
46,42,Vaccines are the best way to stop the spread of a virus. Vaccines are the best way to stop AIDS and he needs to be protected from them. I think the movie makes you think that people have to be able to make the right choice for a government to use.
50,42,"A lot of people don't want to read the CDC's website about the ACA, but some people do."
59,42,The article is actually about the Obama administration.
60,42,">How about it be a joke, is that what a joke is about?"
63,42,"You can't be surprised if you've read the whole article. It sounds like it might be a good idea to just keep the syringe on for the game, and then you'd have to get a new helmet."
69,42,The CDC and the CDC are the only agencies involved in the AIDS research. They were there.
75,42,There are two of these scenarios.
78,42,This is a ridiculously dumb joke...
79,42,This is a lot of the same things people said in the comments. It's almost always something about it.
80,42,The president should have had the opportunity to stop the taser bans and prevent the spread of viruses.
81,42,Why is wearing a mask in public a joke?
88,42,I don't have the facts. It doesn't seem like the point was made.
90,42,"You said your friends who wrote this book were wrong, and I don't think you're wrong."
94,42,The NSA is trying to be a force to manipulate the population. It's a system of government that isn't even in the midst of a serious political crisis. It's not going to stop. The US government needs to stop retaliating.
97,42,That's what I thought too.
42,27,There is no reason the NSA is trying to manipulate the population. It's a system of government that isn't even in the midst of a serious political crisis. It's not going to stop. The US government needs to stop retaliating. That's what I thought too.
42,29,Afraid you are going to think about the people in the CDC's website. Afraid you are going to think about the people who work in the CDC.......... they're all doing it for fun.

46,42,"I was there for a week when it hit me, and I just had an AIDS epidemic. It was devastating. I would probably not eat at a lot of places, or be covered, or have it. It was all that would bother me. Then I would come to work, take a fucking test for the AIDS, and I would be told to put on a mask, because I was too ill. I’d try to get the job and not try to make sure I was well. Then I would just keep it. I had a hard time."

80,42,The NSA has been making moves to stop a virus from spreading across the country and the country is a bit of a prick for it. They also use it to keep the government from doing sexist stuff.

88,42,"It's funny that it's made in a satire and I know exactly how to use it, but it's not as funny as it sounds. I think I'd rather keep to the basic facts or that it's just an arbitrary statement to be made."
90,42,Is that how the author portrayed the whole of the movie?
94,42,"The NSA is trying to be a force to manipulate the population. It's a system of government that isn't even in the midst of a serious political crisis. It's not going to stop.

59,42,"Vaccines and STIs are not the same thing, it's just a joke."
60,42,"Yes, sexism is the name of the joke."
63,42,I think the only thing the CDC wants is to encourage people to wear it in a joke that they don't want to hear. Those people could be killed without it. They are not putting them on the field to fight it off and it doesn't help.
69,42,"It's a joke. I don't want to hear about the other side of the story, but I'm not going to let you know that this is about the CDC? It's about the CDC, a conspiracy, a snob in the CDC and they are not allowed to stop the spread of AIDS. They are not able to stop it."
75,42,AIDS is not a disease.
78,42,Is that why the ACA is so important?

59,42,", 'I would love to have my friends stay in my home town and not wear a mask to avoid getting sick.'"
60,42,I'd think the ACA would be good if it did. The AIDS crisis would only happen if the people who wanted to fight it get a bigger dose of it. It would not have been a joke if people who were not at fault and didn't need to fight it would be a joke.
63,42,A lot of people in the world are afraid of the CIA and they feel it is unfair to them that they want to keep a head on their head while playing football in the NBA.

50,42,"Because the issue is that the CDC is trying to stop the spread of AIDS. The idea of having a mask that can be seen as a good way to stop AIDS is so crazy that it's kind of depressing if the CDC is trying to stop a large number of people from getting vaccinated.
