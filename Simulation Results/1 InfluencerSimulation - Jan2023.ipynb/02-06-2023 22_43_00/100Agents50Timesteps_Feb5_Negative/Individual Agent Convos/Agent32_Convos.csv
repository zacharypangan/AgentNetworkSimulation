32,14,i don't think trump is that stupid. trump is not smart enough to understand that.

64,32,I agree - they should ban it but they don't seem to take it seriously - but I'm not sure what they would like to call this without a mask.
65,32,"The government must be accountable for this, including their actions. They must be accountable for putting a state's children and grandchildren at risk and keeping that from them and the people who care for them. They can't be accountable for their actions."
66,32,The guy that won the war with a mask must not turn himself in.
81,32,The wikipedia article says people are not afraid of the mask.
82,32,And what are the consequences for using this weapon?
85,32,oh man you should come to georgia it s like people here think wearing a mask gives them covid there s so few oh man you should come to georgia it s like people here think wearing a mask gives them covid there s so few oh man you should come to georgia it s like people here think wearing a mask gives them covid there s so few
90,32,"I don't see the reason for it but its a symptom of an underlying disease, not necessarily any type of illness. The fact that it s so contagious makes me think that some people wear it to ward off the ravages."
93,32,We also don t have a way to use the jab in any kind of situation.

32,8,This was written by a person named trump.
32,14,"I don't see how I can get rid of my mask, and I'm a man of my word covid."
32,21,Isn't it important for the government to put people at risk? Because that's what the American public is saying.
35,32,What is a gif that mentions the government sending in a fake tampon to kill people?
40,32,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
52,32,"I can't believe that the most blatant example of a ""vaccaine ban"" in the U.S. has been found to be the use of a mask that protects one person from a virus. I can't believe that the newest strain has been able to spread by itself and spread by the state."
58,32,"I am a US Senator and my job requires me to wear a mask and I want to go to college so I can work on it asap. I am not an authority in the US, but I feel like I need to look up a few things. The gov't does not have a list of what to do, and I am not allowed to do what to do."
64,32,"I was at a theater when a friend of mine took him to the hospital and said, ""Hey, do you like wearing masks on my hands and putting them on?"" He put on a mask and walked through a room a few feet later and woke up to the sound of his eyes on the TV. I just sat down."
65,32,"He's being decried because of what he said. It doesn't sound like he's defending his own beliefs on a personal level. He's saying that it's because he likes wearing a mask, and not because he can't wear a mask. It's just one part of a much larger scheme to decriminalize people if they can afford it."
66,32,"It seems to me that when we start talking about vaccines, the government is trying to veto any laws that prevent people from having sex."
81,32,It seems that a lot of people want to see a mask in public and not a mask in public. That's just too much for them.
82,32,The government is responsible for the removal of this weapon.
85,32,The guy wearing a mask is being a dick. I am not sure why he was wearing a mask.
90,32,"""I think we need to get a proper policy on this Well if the people who do wear a mask get shot, they are getting caught."
93,32,"I'm not sure if anyone here is aware of this, but this is a serious issue for someone who doesn't read the government."
97,32,A great way to put it is to never wear a mask without one and don't wear a mask as an excuse.
99,32,"I don't know if that's a true answer, but I want to go with you. The people are great. I really want them to take care of you See this is how crazy trump s made the united states of America if you want order in america president donald j trump must take off his mask and turn himself in oh and every day he doesn't people will die starting tonight i m a man of my word covid"
32,8,It's a very hard question to answer.
32,14,/r/politics got something like this recently.
32,21,"If you have a choice between you wanting a mask on or you wanting a helmet on, there is a way to get rid of it."
35,32,"I just wanted to add that it's an anti-virus and it seems like I've been getting sick from wearing it in the past. I've heard so many different stories about this in my own life, and I don't want to say that I know exactly what the problem is because I've been vaccinated or not, but the mask sucked because it's so small and it didn't do anything useful. I didn't need it to take care of my health. I didn't even have a mask in my neck and put it under a hand"
40,32,"Is the question, if anyone's interested, whether this is relevant in our context?"
52,32,a ninja is a guy who is trying to have a conversation with his head coach (I think I don't understand why you think that) by referring to a mask. I resent the whole thing and I think we should have a discussion on why the mask is necessary and why not the fact that the mask is needed to prevent this?
58,32,I’m a professional sports coach in Colorado. I wear a helmet but the gov’t tries to prevent me from wearing the mask. They say it protects from the spread of a virus.
64,32,...and the NSA.
65,32,"""We have a public health agency that is an agency. We don't get to make any decisions at all in a government system."""
66,32,"It seems to me that when we start talking about vaccines, the government is trying to veto any laws that prevent people from having sex."
81,32,I'm just a weird tidbit but what is your point? Basically the truth is that we're doing the same thing with this. We'll resign and not coach until this nonsense stops '.
82,32,"I don't understand why people would want to wear a mask because it's a way of preventing the spread of a virus. It's not just for the sake of stopping a virus, it's to keep it from spreading."
85,32,"I think a lot of people want to be able to stop the spread of a virus in Georgia because people will think it is a great idea and have it spread, or because of the way things are going, or because it's something that's already been implemented in a lot of places."
90,32,I think the government is ignoring people who can't pick it up without a mask.
93,32,"""Potentialists on the Run"" (president) is probably right about it, but this is a great example of that."
97,32,"The guy that said it was just a joke, you don't hear it often, and people in these subs have a tendency to be really defensive. It seems like it's not really a big deal, but it's true. It's not like some guys are so downvoted, though they are right."
99,32,"Do you understand why the movie is not about it? Like, it's about the US government invading Russia and then destroying the Iraqi civil war. In it, the US government is threatening to shut down the military for the rest of its existence."
32,8,>A lot of people want to be able to stop the spread of a virus.
32,14,"I'm not saying that I don't understand why people would want to wear a mask, just that they are uncomfortable enough to wear it, and it is a violation of the law. I was talking about the question of why people are trying to stop that in the first place. Is it a question if it is a big deal? Or does it just matter how well the government treats the people?"
32,21,It's also pretty tame that people are resentful of the government and feel that removing the mask is going to just keep the world from spreading it.
35,32,"The problem with wearing a mask is that it is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. I'm sorry he didn't vote against it, what is the state bringing to the debate."
40,32,There's a real answer here: I think it is a bit odd that he is wearing a mask and being able to do so.
52,32,"He said ""[he] wants the state to be the best state to teach his players and not give him the choice between the sexyness of a mask or a mask worn under a helmet."" I'd suggest them get the first round pick of the ACA,"
58,32,"You're implying that, because you aren't a professional sports coach, the NSA is doing the same thing. It's completely true that some people need to be vaccinated, but this isn't the case. This is part of the national security agenda, not the NSA."
64,32,">I'm sorry, but the ""Mask-a-man"" meme about the flu. I'm a skeptic."
65,32,[Note to self: I don't know how to say that in a public health context.
66,32,The biggest political challenge in history and is the biggest failure in the last 30 years.

85,32,"""The guy wearing a mask is being a dick. I am not sure why he was wearing a mask."
90,32,That's not fair. A health care policy.
93,32,"If it's true, this is not the only way to get people to wear masks, but to have people be able to choose to wear them."

32,8,"I hate that meme, but I don't think we know who a bad coach is."
32,14,The NSA is threatening to shut down the military for the rest of its existence. Is this in the ACA or not?
32,21,"I am going to eat the one slut I drank and get sick so I can eat it so I don't have to eat it. I'm going to eat it, but I can't eat it. The whole idea is crazy. And I've had to eat it. My husband hates drooling over it."
35,32,"I'm so sorry, but I’m afraid I’m actually really close to that. Whenever I look at the internet and hear a post with this exact title, I can see how a lot of people would say the same thing - because they didn’t want to.

I think if you want to get vaccinated and didn’t like the way it went, you are going"
40,32,> The article says you must not wear a mask because it is considered a part of the US's security system.
52,32,"It's like the doctor in the national guard vowed to avoid wearing a mask, but I was just laughing because the doctors have been vowed to do the same to their coach who is going to have to deal with some health issues and make their decisions in this regard, and he's not going to listen to them anyway."
58,32,"The article suggests that the US government is doing everything for national security. It's not ""helping"" with the spread of the virus."
64,32,"I don't think the person is going to stop him from trying to become a lawyer, but the government isn't going to stop it for decades. I think it's a good idea to put it on the top of our lists."
65,32,CANNOTANSWER? Hmm. I just don't know what that means for me.
66,32,The wiki article says that the gov't is trying to veto a virus that prevents people from having sex.

40,32,You say it's part of the US's security system.
52,32,The problem is the government. A reversible virus can get you sick.
58,32,"The problem is that some people need to be vaccinated, because if they don't get a vaccine they're not going to be able to have a conversation about it without telling the general public."
64,32,I just want to ask the NSA to do a simple survey to see what they think the best solution is. They would rather just stop getting to know us.
65,32,"In this case, it would be a'sucker' for the government to try to put a mask on your face so that if you got caught in an outbreak, you would not be able to get vaccinated. In that case, it's a prank on you for being not able to get it on, which is really not an acceptable response."
66,32,That's the most anti-virus joke that I've ever heard. It's not like we can't just stop it.
81,32,"Considering it seems like people in those countries don't care what you say and just want to tarp on them, and do something to prevent people from getting the disease, I would assume you're right that it's dangerous to the general public, and that the government could tarp on them."
82,32,"It's a very, very, very, very, ill-equipped person."
85,32,"Well, this isn't just about this ACA, it's about what it does. The ACA is about the public health issue, but also about what it does and how it affects people."
90,32,I like the movie. I enjoy watching it as a good example of the ACA. I think it's cool that the ACA has not been implemented yet unless it is the one that's really affecting the health care industry. The US government is spreading a virus to people that can't even pick it up without a mask.
93,32,We have an example of this here:
97,32,It is a good thing he's not wearing a mask until the problem is solved.
99,32,"I think the issue with the movie is that the country has already given out ""no orders"" for the Iraq war."
32,8,"I have seen the movie The Reversible. The ACA, which is about the public health issue, is a very good example."
32,14,"If we can't just fuck the ACA, how can we do it?"
32,21,I'm a college football coach who is a teacher and a scout.
35,32,">I believe the point here is that this is a topic of discussion, not a subject of discussion. The only people who'd make a problem with it a question that would come up in my head are the ""people who don't know what their problem is"" and the ""people who don't know what they're doing wrong."""
40,32,">The problem with this is that you have to learn that you will have to be vaccinated, because the CDC has a mandate."
52,32,"In my experience it's the ACA that's the most necessary for preventative healthcare (and if you think the ACA is ineffective if it prevents them from doing so, it's actually illegal). It's the one that has to change, because it will not have an immediate effect. If it had passed in its first year, the system would be so far removed that people would simply stop using the masks."
58,32,"The government is not in charge of the prevention of viral infections in general, it isn't in charge of stopping the spread of a virus."
64,32,They're trying to get people to wear masks to stop people from using them. It's just an excuse to be off my lawn and be uncomfortable. The government has a problem.
65,32,"The CDC is trying to prevent it, but not for a prank, it's because of an illegal bill that allows the government to cover all the bases for the medical crisis that plagues the world."
66,32,"If it makes the president a tyrant, it will stop the government from supporting health care and is a huge mistake."
81,32,"I can't speak for the other guy, but I think it's hard to come up with a reason to wear a mask and how to protect yourself."
82,32,"In Australia, we have an ACA. CANNOTANSWER : ""Why don't they wear a mask to prevent the spread of HIV. Its only a problem if they can't get away with it."""
85,32,It seems like the only thing that people are asking to be addressed is that it is about what is being talked about.
90,32,I'm not sure why you are asking this. The video game thing is really stupid. It's just a movie.
93,32,What the fuck? Why would a president be an opportunistic dictator if it's a problem?
97,32,"The issue here is a mask in a sport that does not belong to a team, and a player does not fit into a team whose coach did not play as a fullback. In fact, you should read the title of the post and see what it says about the president in general."
99,32,"I'm not a liberal, but I enjoy the idea of a movie with a really interesting title and it does give you a better perspective on the situation. I love it because it makes the movie feel like a lot of fun to read, but it doesn't do the same justice to the actor who wrote the movie. It's pretty interesting but still, i don't really think it makes sense to me. I think it's a shame the government is obsessed with the death of the president and the government doesn't have the right to act like a good leader."
32,8,That movie is really cool. I think it's a great movie.
32,14,"The ACA does nothing to stop people from wearing masks - unless you are in the minority or have a history of having that problem, and that isn't actually a problem at all. The problem is the ACA is a problem with the ACA."
32,21,"No, I don't care. That's a good point."
35,32,People are often confused when people say I don't want to be vaccinated. They think my parents wouldn't have a problem if I wore a mask. I grew up with a guy that got sick and did nothing but dread getting sick. I don't know what he is talking about here. It's just an observation. The problem isn't with the idea. People are not stealing. I'd go and find out what a medical emergency is. The FBI has a great influence. You just need to get yourself the CDC
40,32,I'm a bit confused by the title of the whole thing.
52,32,"It's not in any sense illegal, but its the best solution. If a country in general doesn't do anything about it, they are going to get caught up in what's called ""politics."""
58,32,Why don't people wear a mask to help prevent sick people from getting sick? That's not a joke.
64,32,"I know a few people who have seen the movie. I know that the video is about the ACA, but I also know the meme, so I can relate to the story."
65,32,"I just want to say that it makes no sense to be able to look at your face in the picture. If I can't get vaccinated, I would be able to look at that face in the same way you would when you are not able to get vaccinated. I would not have the courage to try it."
66,32,"Until the president tells his family he needs to get vaccinated with a mask, he might become a tyrant. If the people who pushed for the ACA weren't the ones promoting it, the government could be vetoing it."
81,32,">We need to get rid of the ""no mask"" rule for those places, but there aren't enough ways to prevent it."
82,32,People wearing a mask is the biggest problem facing America.
85,32,They’re being fucking shady. They fucking suck! They are the same people who tried to pass a bill to help protect everyone.
90,32,"i'm not gonna get any good responses from people who want to talk about this, but you seem to be ignoring a whole lot of the issues he's trying to address here"

32,8,"Apparently, wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
32,14,Is this a problem of the ACA?

64,32,"I am very sorry, but I feel like this meme is on the front page, which I am not, and I feel like this meme is just another piece of shit."
65,32,That CDC does not want to prevent the spread of HIV in the US but it doesn't want to be the cause of it because it's an illegal thing to do.
66,32,">The issue is that he is wearing the mask, and that you are the troll. The whole ACA veto is a huge mistake. I’m afraid I may have just been reading the title, but I can’t help you here. The CDC and CDC are unable to meet their mission to address the ax problem. They are not authorized to address this problem."
81,32,"I know this is sexist, but you aren't going to get it."
82,32,I am a big fan of people who wear masks in Australia. The people who pushed for the ACA are the ones who made it illegal.
85,32,"I mean... it is a big deal that the ACA is a bad idea. It is a big deal that it doesn't include HIV and it is a really stupid thing to wear, especially since there is a huge omission in their health care policy."
90,32,"I'm so sorry. There is no way in hell to end this shit. He's trying to get the message across, and he is trying to get it through with that."
93,32,What would you say to the article?
97,32,"A coach's first word is ""I see a lot of people who play at USN in the comments are really down voted because of the way the media's coverage of USN players is reported. I don't see the point in playing as a coach when you're in the NBA, I see a point in playing at a major league university. I can see where the problem is with the offensive messages from the president. But the point is a mask can't be applied to anything that doesn't belong there."
99,32,They've had a chance to get the author to explain their position.
32,8,I'm gonna be fuckin'stupid about it. You know what happened when the ACA was a problem?
32,14,"It is a problem of the ACA, but it does not stop people from wearing masks, especially when they are in the minority. I know the president is an opportunistic dictator."
32,21,CANNOTANSWER is trying to get people to stop the spread of HIV.
35,32,That is the problem. It is not about people being able to get themselves the CDC.
40,32,"I remember reading this because I thought the NSA could prevent HIV/AIDS, not a joke. I thought he was a very intelligent guy, and thought he was a bit smart."
52,32,I don't think he is a joke.
58,32,Is a mask part of a masks agenda?
64,32,"Well, a new meme with the name ""Mask a Man"" is coming out."
65,32,"It is also possible that the CDC uses this to influence policies. And a group of people from the US aren't going to be able to buy a cheap, standardized virus vaccine to get sick without their own permission."

90,32,"I know the feeling. The one who says the movie is a satire of the book, but that's just a ream of lies."
93,32,"I'm not the one who wrote the article, I'm the one who writes it. It's very hard to make a real argument on this one."
97,32,"... and the other commenters didn't make the connection to the issue, they didn't make a connection to the issue, and what if the players did and then didn't wear the mask."
99,32,[The book](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/article/askthealert) is on the subject of the virus.
32,8,">Is this because the health care industry is so inflexible to the fact that a doctor should be wearing a mask,"
32,14,"If you're looking for a source about this you should read a ""Mask a Man"" (which is about how a mask helps a doctor get sick). It's a really good read, and it's pretty clear that it's a very common conversation."
32,21,So how can people get a slut they drank and get sick without their own permission?
35,32,"A very specific and tame hygienic way to look at a health issue. The issue isn't the fact that you are having a tough time expressing your opinion about a question, it's that you are not 'informed' about the issue. It's that you are not aware of the hygienic nature of the problem. And the problem is that this is not a legitimate reason not to get vaccinated."
40,32,I really like the title of this thread.
52,32,"OP, I'm just getting to this point."
58,32,I am a CDC member and it's actually about vaccines. But I am also an experienced physician. You should try putting on a mask. I can't imagine how that could be a joke. The CDC and my friend's parents had to sign a consent form so the US government could be the gov't.
64,32,People are not doing the right thing. We are the people that will be responsible for the problem. We are the people who will be responsible for the problem.
65,32,"You've been on the front page for some time and were actually really ignorant to what the article was about, except for the comment about why the government hasn't gotten involved in the AIDS epidemic as a whole and why people aren't going to understand."
66,32,I don't think the ax veto makes the President a tyrant. The veto is a joke. The president doesn't care about the ax. The veto is the veto. But it's a joke.
81,32,"So you're saying it's sexist to try to take advantage of this? I mean, it's just ridiculous."
82,32,">I believe the author is an orthodox Christian, which means that it was not a great idea for the majority of Americans, and they still don't know what to believe."
85,32,This article is being criticized a lot by the media and that is a little bit misleading.
90,32,"I don't get why anyone says the movie isn't a good movie. The entire point of the movie is to make the movie better, not to satirize the book."
93,32,"No I haven't read the whole article, I haven't heard a single example that has even come close to the title."
97,32,"I mean I love a bit of football, but I do like wearing a mask."
99,32,The idea is to get the people to actually read the article before going to see the movie.
32,8,Are you a politician? Maybe that's a valid point.
32,14,">The issue isn't the fact that you are having a tough time expressing your opinion about a question, it's that you are not aware of the hygienic nature of the problem."
32,21,"In a nutshell, the people who voted for it and were against it were actually on the front page of the front page of this sub."
35,32,"I'm trying to say that I like that it's the anti-AIDS and anti-vaccine tampon thing. And I don't like that it's a r/advice and r/terrorists thing, but it's a r/research/article that states that the government's mandate is ""protecting citizens"". That's how I felt about the ACA, what I think that the NSA is doing is a good job of helping, and I don't think that that is the problem."
40,32,He got it. The CDC and the CIA are involved in a conflict.
52,32,i mean... The president isnt a joke. i'm just saying that he is a joke because of how stupid his ideas are.
58,32,People wear masks because it's a way to stop the spread of the virus and prevent people from getting sick. It's not a joke. People wear masks because they're less likely to get sick. That's why they're in the CDC.
64,32,CANNOTANSWER:
65,32,This isn't really a retribution. It's not a retribution. It's not a retribution.
66,32,"I'm not sure what that means, but I'm also not sure if the joke would make any sense. There is a lot of misinformation about the ACA, and the joke is that it's a joke. You're not a doctor, and that's really not the point."
81,32,>We wear masks to fight the flu.
82,32,"Why don't people wear a mask to prevent the spread of HIV. Its only a problem if they can't get away with it."""
85,32,"It's a petty joke that you made up about the president wearing a mask, but it's a really good one."
90,32,What the author said was the correct response. I’m actually going to check it out tomorrow.
93,32,"CANNOTANSWER: I'm not against the ACA. I'm not sure if anyone here is aware of this, but this is a serious issue for someone who doesn't read the government."
97,32,"I don't know about you, but the person who wrote this was a guy that played for the national team. It's really weird to read these things in such an interesting way."
99,32,They're being told a story about how the government is threatening to shut down the military for the rest of its existence. They said it was not about him but about the issue of the 'terrorist attack' in the movie. The article is about the issue and the government is trying to prevent a more civil war in the US. There are lots of stories about him in this movie and it is interesting because it's about the issue.
32,8,CANNOTANSWER: 'I am not really a politician.
32,14,This was the kind of joke that came out when he was a presidential candidate.
32,21,"CANNOTANSWER's mother is a college football coach who is a teacher and a scout. She also writes a book called ""The Secret Service and the President's Secret Service."""
35,32,You're an idiot. That's not a problem. It's a problem.
40,32,"It's actually pretty fucked up, IMO. I'm hoping to find a guy who doesn't have a mask."
52,32,I was just being facetious when I read this. The president is a joke.
58,32,"""We need to stop using the NSA as an excuse for the ACA."""
64,32,What's the best part? Are you the one that doesn't like this?
65,32,"The issue is the government. If the government doesn't put in a mask and people aren't vaccinated, that's it."
66,32,I like this movie because it's about the truth. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of a virus.
81,32,"""No, I think that I should wear a mask and protect myself from the flu. I don't understand why they think it helps them or not. They think the mask helps them."
82,32,"CANNOTANSWER : ""People wearing a mask is the biggest problem facing America. I am a fan of people who believe in the ACA. They do not want the people who want it to stop the spread of a virus or the people who think the ACA is an excellent idea"""
85,32,"I was just curious about the meaning of the word “as in, what is the word for” so I thought the general definition was something like, “Oh man that’s like people here think wearing a mask gives them covid there s so few oh man you should come to Georgia, it s like people here think wearing a mask gives them covid there s so few oh man you should come to Georgia”"
90,32,"> ""The whole thing seems to be blaming 'police' and people having no interest in what that means. The whole thing seems to be ignoring a whole lot of the issues he's trying to address. I'm so sorry. There is no way in hell to end this shit."
93,32,"CANNOTANSWER: I'm not against the ACA. I'm not sure if anyone here is aware of this, but this is a serious issue for someone who doesn't read the government."
97,32,It's also a big deal that the players in the NFL are the only ones that are at fault for the AIDS problem. I'm not sure if it's true or not. But it sounds like a nice guy with a mask will have a hard time bringing this up. The way the post cites the president's trolling a comment makes it seem a little overly witty.
99,32,"""Hey, I'll be your president for a day!"""
32,8,He's a man who believes in the ACA and the American people want to believe it.
32,14,People wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
32,21,The issue is the government. The problem is that the ACA is too vague for them to know the facts about.
35,32,That's just a good point.
40,32,"i know there is a lot of nonsense going on here, and they need to put this in a video because he is a fucking joke about a 'commentary' on the CIA and the CIA. but i'm really surprised the cia and the cdc are going to try to do something about it."
52,32,I am not saying it isn't a joke. I am saying that the government is unable to communicate effectively. It's what the government is supposed to do.
58,32,This is so bizarre! I've never read it.
64,32,"This is an interesting issue that is the same as the ACA. What's funny about it is that it's being put on the front page on the front page by the NSA. If the ACA didn't pass, then they are trying to be more akin to the ACA."
65,32,"You're not a racist, you're a racist. This is not a real issue. This is not a real problem. The problem is the government. The problem is the government. The problem is the government. If you want to make a change then you need to work with the people who elect you to the White House. This is a problem. You are being racist, you are being racist, and you are being racist."
66,32,"I don't think the movie was sarcastic, but it was really good."
81,32,"I'm sorry this came up. I've been in a similar situation a few times. I was a reporter in the media for awhile. It was pretty clear this was a joke, and they were working on getting rid of it, and now it's a sexist issue. It's not funny."
82,32,I am really confused as to how it has affected the people. I think it has a huge negative connotation to him that he was trying to do the right thing.
85,32,"I've heard the saying of the president who went to a doctor's office to get his doctor vaccinated? It's a good idea, but it doesn't sound that bad."
90,32,"So when I read the title, you think ""I don't want a mask on the girl. If you read this book as a kid, I can't help but read the book and it seems to me that this is a satire of the book."""
93,32,"In an ACA article: ""The president is an opportunistic dictator. I don't think the government has anything wrong with that."
97,32,I think they want to avoid teasing if they feel the need to.
99,32,I didn't say anything about a good movie.
32,8,The ACA is the reversible.
32,14,"He's an opportunist dictator. The ACA is not the issue of him, it's the problems of people who believe he's trying to change the world."
32,21,The problem is the government. The problem is the government.
35,32,>Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
40,32,CANNOTANSWER:
52,32,"You're talking about the whole Obama administration, and you're talking about the guy with the mask."
58,32,This is a shit job.
64,32,i aint really in the top five but this meme is the most annoying one ever.
65,32,">what does being an NSA agent have to do with getting a man to be wearing a mask? You're not a racist, you're a racist."
66,32,"The ACA is part of a larger conspiracy to be a ""troll""."
81,32,>We wear masks to fight the flu. It's only part of the ACA that makes it an acceptable use.
82,32,What a wonderful piece of information.
85,32,">I've heard that there's a virus in Georgia, which is also spreading in the US and can cause complications for people. Then there's a virus. Then there's a virus."
90,32,> The author has a lot of bad ideas. The movie is awful.
93,32,"I think the point of the article is to bring the issue of the president and its agenda into line with the agenda of the Obama administration - which in my opinion, has no place in the policy of the Obama administration."
97,32,I think that it's kinda hard for the players and the media to make any connections to the real issue unless the president is a troll. I guess they have to make a decision before they go full-on.
99,32,>The movie is pretty good. The whole thing is pretty good. The idea is to get the people to actually read the article before going to see the movie.
32,8,The ACA is a very good example of how the government has put a reversible healthcare system in place.
32,14,I'm very familiar with this sub.
32,21,>We wear masks to fight the flu. It's only part of the ACA that makes it an acceptable use.
35,32,Vaccination is a serious health issue.
40,32,I'm going to have to agree with you on this but I'm sure that they are really going to try and do something about it.
52,32,"The president, a joke, is not a joke. I thought you had some interesting ideas that came out of his mouth, like a 'couple of jokes that he might have found in the media that he'd use to justify his policies?' But he said they're not the only jokes that are made out of the ACA, because of the way his government has handled the issue. It's an inadequacy. I don't see the point of this being a joke, but it's not a joke. I don't"
58,32,"> I do not have a list of what to do, and I am not allowed to do what to do."
64,32,"A lot of the comments are about the people who have the virus, so I'd consider this one of those"
65,32,This is one of the most important things I've encountered in public health situations. It's a shame that the CDC isn't willing to work with patients who aren't in a position to provide proper protection for the people who are.
66,32,The author of the book is clearly in a coma with the trolls.
81,32,A lot of people don't even realize that a mask is part of the ACA. AIDS vaccines are a very important part of our system. There is no need to do anything about it.
82,32,"""We're 'those' people who want ACA. But this isn't an option, that's a problem."""
85,32,"The issue isn't that the president is not doing anything about it, it's that he's promoting a good idea."
90,32,"""... the movie is awful. I'm sorry but I think it's overrated. """
93,32,CANNOTANSWER has a great idea for the title to be 'I think people have a problem with the government but they also have a problem with the government'.
97,32,"I'd say it's interesting that a lot of the comments are referencing a quote from the article ""Why don't they just use the word mask when they're going to stop the spread of the virus."""
99,32,i love the sarcastic parts of it.
32,8,There is some reason for this: I have a CDC contract with the CDC. I would like to see an article from the CDC stating that it is more difficult than other 'comments' about AIDS.
32,14,>I think the point of the article is to bring the issue of the president and its agenda into line with the agenda of the Obama administration. I think that it's kinda hard for the players and the media to make any connections to the real issue unless the president is a troll.

40,32,"CANNOTANSWER: ""Hey, it really did make me cringe a little."""
52,32,It's an inadequacy. It's an inadequacy. The president is doing the best he can.
58,32,"... 'The problem is that some people need to be vaccinated, because if they don't get a vaccine they're not going to be able to have a conversation about it without telling the general public.''"
64,32,I'm sure a lot of people are aware of the whole idea.
65,32,"The first thing I thought when I saw your comment was ""... You know what? How many people do you know about the CDC?"
66,32,What was the point of the book?
81,32,"In America, the President must sign a bill. They can say no to any hat, and they can just refuse to do so. So if we are just going to keep going with this ridiculous bill, we're not going to be able to make a good president."
82,32,"In an article by the author that was published in 2009, the government cites some of their top 10 policies, including Obamacare."
85,32,"I am not a liberal, but I have seen a lot of posts that were written by liberals or conservatives, and a lot of them were written by liberals in the 70s and 80s. There are plenty of things that a moderate republican would never put on a front page."
90,32,It's a satire of the book. It's just a satire of the book. It doesn't mention the ACA.
93,32,"I'm not sure about the ""the idea of doing things"", but I think ""The Obamacare repeal plan is really the best I've ever read about."" I would be very interested to know."
97,32,This is so silly. There are too many people who are really into football to understand the issue. They want to see this in action.
99,32,"You could say something like, 'I'm not a liberal, but I enjoyed the idea of a movie with a really interesting title and it does give you a better perspective on the situation. I like this movie because it's about the truth."

32,14,"There are a lot of interesting things in this sub, like how the ""Mask a Man"" book is about the CDC's policy to stop the spread of the virus. The author is so well known that they've all tried to scoff at people for ""fucking the ACA"" and ""if they can't just fuck the ACA, how can we do it?"""
32,21,I think you are right that it is hard to bring the issue of the president into line with the agenda of the Obama administration.
35,32,I don't think I'm going to use the'sci-info_of_a_gov' term in that context.
40,32,This is why the ACA is so funny. I thought it would make him cringe a little.
52,32,The president of the United States is a troll.
58,32,I feel like I'm about to be kicked out of this post by someone that actually knows the meaning of ''i'm a great president''. I know that feeling.
64,32,No. The ACA isn't a disaster. The Obama Administration is trying to make people think they have a problem with the government.
65,32,What are the people who don't know about the CDC?
66,32,"""The author is clearly in a coma with the trolls."""
81,32,I don't even understand how this came up.
82,32,People don't like having a medical condition (or having them).
85,32,"he was being a dick to get a headband, to see the guy's face"
90,32,CANNOTANSWER'S BAD PARTY:

32,8,"The ACA, which is about the public health issue, is a very good example."
32,14,"I'm a little embarrassed because I don't believe the people that voted for the ACA will say 'no'. It's a shame that it is a major issue, and that the ACA is the most important one of those issues."

58,32,The president is basically a puppet.
64,32,"What the fuck are you talking about? The truth is, that's just part of this story."
65,32,"They need to give them a mask instead of a restraining order. That's not going to stop people from getting a vaccinated or getting a standardized vaccine, unless they know they can be vaccinated."
66,32,"I’m not a doctor, I’m a health care professional. I’m not a physician. I have never seen anything about the ACA. I was told by a health care expert at a medical college that the only ACA protections they offer are those for minors or people with HIV/AIDS. It’s all so bizarre, I don’t know why they don’t make the ACA a veto, but I don’t see the benefit to you if you just tell them."
81,32,>Which is a joke? We need to start a new generation of coaches that are able to understand the consequences of what they are doing.

90,32,"I think that if he can be a good example to the public for his own sake, he's not an idiot."
93,32,This is all based on the same basic idea of an illogical conspiracy.

52,32,"The US government is able to communicate effectively, and I have no doubt it's able to do so. This seems like a fair thing to ask the president to do and to not do anything to stop the spread of this virus."
58,32,What would you do if you weren't allowed to wear a mask and your friends are not in the CDC?
64,32,This is my favorite part of the whole AMA. It has such a nice and informative tone. Certainly something that I'm not going to stop myself from.
65,32,I think you're being pretty damn sexist.

32,14,"It's a good book and one that I'll read. I'm going to go get the books, I can't wait to read them."
32,21,It's an old joke. The president is basically a puppet.

64,32,You're so ignorant! I have a friend with a flu virus. He has a t-shirt.

81,32,>I am going to resign and not coach until this nonsense stops.

If there is a doctor, you're still a doctor"
93,32,Why doesn't the Obama Administration put this information into the article? Why didn't they put it into the headline?

58,32,The whole story is just a bit of a fad that people tend to get caught up in.
64,32,"I love it when people wear it in public. There are people who wear it in public to rant, etc. The government tries to make people feel uncomfortable by making the whole thing just a prank. But the one thing that's really interesting is that some people aren't aware that it's a prank."
65,32,>The mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
66,32,"Is he going to get the ACA vetoed and do that because he's a hater? I don't think it's a veto because he's wearing a mask, but I'm not sure he'll get one, unless he wants it."
81,32,I think it's hilarious that someone like this is in a lot of this subreddit and not going to read all the articles. I was in a group of people and we all agreed that this was a prank.
82,32,The article says that I'm not anti-Semitic and that's an interesting post. It has more to do with this than the title suggests.

65,32,"The problem isn't the mask, it's the whole government. If it is the problem is the government it's a problem. They can't stop people from getting vaccinated if they're not in the right place and it's a prank. The problem is the government. They have to make it happen."

32,21,A lot of things about the ACA are a prank. The ACA isn't for anyone who isn't concerned with the health of the public. They're for people who are concerned about the health of the public. It is a joke because it is the government's job to keep the government in line. It isn't just the government. It is part of the president's job to keep the people from getting sick or dying.

97,32,I can see where the problem is with the offensive messages from the president. But the point is that he isn't wearing a mask until the problem is solved.
99,32,I loved the book and the movie. The book is a good read. I love the book and the movie. The movie is pretty good. The book is pretty good. The idea is to get the people to actually read the book before going to see the movie.

35,32,The CDC has a history of being critical of Americans. They are also trying to get people to take a risk and help prevent diseases from spreading. It is important to protect them from their virus if they do not. They are not government entities. There is not much they can do about it.
40,32,"The whole ACA is a joke. It is not a prank. The idea that it's a joke is ridiculous. It's like a prank. The ACA is designed to address the problem of AIDS. The entire issue is the president, he just doesn't get it."

65,32,What do you mean by racist?
66,32,I can't help you here. This book is about the ACA and it is a violation of the constitution. The ACA is a violation of that constitution. The ACA is a violation of constitutional rights. The author of the book is a troll.
81,32,The CDC tarped on the people who were wearing their mask because that's exactly what the article was about.
82,32,"I just want to say that the ACA in Australia does not support the right to health care. I'm not saying it is politically correct, but I'm just assuming that you can't believe the actual article states it is a good idea."
85,32,I know a few people that know the word medical because they know that in the US the word'medical' does not exist.
90,32,It is a prank. The movie is a prank and the person who writes the article has a bad attitude.
93,32,What's the name of the author of the article?
97,32,>The article is misleading because it makes no sense for the president to say so. That is why they have to work on this and get the correct answer.
99,32,He has to rely on the public's support. He's being a dick and the government tries to shut him down.

32,14,"The president has to rely on the public's support. He doesn't care about the ACA, he's trying to help people."
32,21,I had the same question as you: is there a good way to put this idea into action?
35,32,"It's a joke, and if you don't get vaccinated, you are not a health issue. There isn't much you can do about it, and it isn't a joke. The CIA doesn't care. Vaccination is a major health issue. Vaccines are not the best way to prevent the spread of a virus. They are not even one of the major a problems. The CDC is an entity that is funded by a government entity (the CIA), and if you don't"
40,32,a big part of the ACA is that they aren't trying to stop it. ACA isn't going to stop that.
52,32,"I'm assuming that's a joke, or maybe that a joke to get a restraining order on wearing a mask that prevents a reversible virus?"
58,32,"This isn't a dick joke, it's a prank."
64,32,CANNOTANSWER is the one who thinks it is a prank and not a joke?
65,32,What is the difference between a mask and a restraining order? It's like a prank that's not even a joke. I'd say your comment is ridiculous. You're being a dick if you don't understand how a mask is sexist and inappropriate.
66,32,What was the point of the book?
81,32,"It's a prank. They're not gonna stop it, they're not going to stop it."
82,32,"The article has some sort of contradiction, and I think it is the best piece of information to be able to convey to you."
85,32,So you think that wearing a mask doesn't bring some sort of health or safety benefit? Or that the president was trying to prevent and protect people from being infected?
90,32,This is a ream of lies by the author.
93,32,Why doesn't the Obama Administration put that information into the headline?

32,14,The title doesn't make any sense. It just suggests that a mask can't be removed because of hygienic reasons. This is about the ACA.
32,21,That's a good one. The idea is a prank because the Obama Administration doesn't want to fight the federal government.
35,32,I can tell you that the people in this thread are more concerned with the shit they hear than the health issues. They're just trying to push the issue out and that they've made a point to ignore it. The CIA hasn't even responded to their requests yet.
40,32,There's a difference between a prank and a joke. The prank isn't about him.
52,32,No way a joke can be written in a way that demonstrates that the government is ineffective. It's the most efficient and effective way to deal with it.

58,32,I don't think a joke is a joke. A joke is a prank. But a joke is a joke.
64,32,"The ""Mask-a-man"" meme is a joke. It's been circulating around for over 20 years and there are still plenty of people who would not be able to find the answers to them. It is a joke."

66,32,The president needs to put his own foot down to stop the ACA from being implemented. There is no point in talking about that and that's all you can do.
