25,14,You know the ones who're on it aren't really a member of the government.
27,14,"It was written on a t shirt, so no one is wearing it!"
32,14,i don't think trump is that stupid. trump is not smart enough to understand that.
38,14,I don't think the medical community is a big fan of this thing.

60,14,> Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus
67,14,You think the government has a mandate to kill you for doing something that isn't harmful?
75,14,Is it worth it? If it is I can t even go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask
78,14,"I'm a deaf nut, but I hate that shit."
100,14,"He's talking about wearing a mask and his health, he's being a jerk to his friends. That was the point."
14,3,I like the idea that you're a woman in a mask a lot because it makes them feel bad about doing something that they don't actually do. It's not your idea.
14,4,I'm going to ask the other guy this: Why do people keep wearing a mask in their car and out of public places? Because I mean I have been to the top of the twitchcon board in a couple days?
14,6,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

60,14,> Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus People will be on their way to the president's house to watch a movie... so here's how it was done in 2012
67,14,That snark. There are so many people in this thread who think that we are supposed to be able to choose what to wear as a safety precaution. I find that kind of response very funny. What do I do? I can't take a hard time breathing in my own mask...
75,14,"Yeah, but a few people drew a line in the context of the video."
78,14,"I'm not a health dept, I'm a deaf nut. I don't know what your post is about."

14,3,Why don't you wear a mask? It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
14,4,"""They need to wear masks and get them vaccinated."""
14,6,Having been to the top of a twitchcon board in a couple days? Is wearing a mask the best way to stop the spread of a virus?
14,9,"I was on a trip to an Asian hotel on a day where I had a problem breathing a lot. It was so bad that the waitress called and said, ""Penguin breathing."""
17,14,It is the best way to keep him away from the dangers of the virus.
18,14,"I've had many friends that wore masks in public - my husband, my mother, and I, too. They were all in public. I'm a huge fan of the new technology that allows you to take your skin off while in the car alone. I don't think you have to wear a mask at all to be able to wear one - at least that's what I have."
19,14,"A lot of people here use masks, but the problem is that in a lot of places you get an infection. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear a mask."
25,14,The AIDS vaccine has been proven to be a viable solution.
27,14,I'm glad the government hasn't rolled over. There hasn't been an attack on public health in nearly a decade.
32,14,/r/politics got something like this recently.
38,14,It's not really a valid reason to wear a mask to fight an illness.
59,14,We have a very strict federal policing system that allows us to do everything we can to prevent the spread of viruses from spread.
60,14,The mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. I've been vaccinated as well. I have even been in a hospital.
67,14,"There are lots of government mandates: I think you need to get a mask..but I'm not against that. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. There isn't a single policy that prohibits them, they have a very specific duty to enforce them."
75,14,"If you want to learn more about Vermont, you're welcome to make your own comments."
78,14,"I just read the whole post as ""I will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops"" I think this is a ridiculous one. It seems like the board is too busy announcing what is being done to stop the spread of the virus."
100,14,That sounds pretty awesome to me!
14,3,"> There isn't a single policy that prohibits them, they have a very specific duty to enforce them."
14,4,I'm glad the government hasn't rolled over. There hasn't been an attack on public health in nearly a decade. /r/politics got something like this recently.
14,6,Wearing a mask for combating a viral infection is ineffective because it's not actually useful.
14,9,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
17,14,"You're saying the government is trying to help you with this, so you need to get out of there and stop the spread of AIDS."
18,14,"I think he's a good guy. And if I remember correctly, he has a mask that's just a way to cover up the fact that he has a rat. And a helmet for an infectious disease."
19,14,"> If I ever woke up at night with a cold, and I saw someone wear a mask, I would put on a mask. They wear masks so I can sleep. I don't think there are mandates in Colorado, where the vaccines don't really work. I wouldn't wear a mask to work but I wouldn't wear it to school or work."
25,14,"The AIDS vaccine has been proven to be a viable solution. Unless we don't have an AIDS outbreak, the mask doesn't work."
27,14,"It's a funny sarcastic ad for the fact that the ""public health"" is a state and not a federal agency."
32,14,"I'm not saying that I don't understand why people would want to wear a mask, just that they are uncomfortable enough to wear it, and it is a violation of the law. I was talking about the question of why people are trying to stop that in the first place. Is it a question if it is a big deal? Or does it just matter how well the government treats the people?"
38,14,Is this the kind of stuff I would wear on my face?
59,14,"- and ""We have a very strict federal policing system that allows us to do everything we can to prevent the spread of viruses from spreading."
60,14,"I know, right? Vaccines are not necessary to stop a virus. The mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. Apparently they're wearing the order because the teacher erect a huge scar on the girl's head."
67,14,You need to get a mask if you don't want to be injured.
75,14,>I don't really think they have any specific mandates on that - just that you can't wear a mask. I think that's what the government is trying to do.
78,14,"I think the problem is that there's so much work in the ACA that the people who don't like to wear a mask just have to put on a mask, because they can't tell the difference between what the vaccine will do and what it will do."
100,14,I don't like wearing a mask. I just don't think it works for me.
14,3,"My wife went to school with someone in a mask that did not allow people to be in it as a condition of employment. She was told that one of the masks had to be removed and that there was no need to replace the other one. I asked her about it and she said she thought it would be incompatible with the idea of getting a public health helmet, so I said that the mask might be a violation of her own privacy."
14,4,"Well, they're not the government, and they don't have the authority to enforce any laws on them."
14,6,"""I think the problem is that there's so much work in the ACA that the people who don't like to wear a mask just have to put on a mask, because they can't tell the difference between what the vaccine will do and what it will do. I think that's what the government is trying to do."
14,9,This is a stupid ad. People are a dick for a very hard-core politician. They would never wear a mask.
17,14,"I know the guy in the movie, Rogs of the Past. I think I've seen it a couple of times."
18,14,"I'm a huge fan of the new technology that allows you to take your skin off while in the car alone. I don't think you have to wear a mask at all to be able to wear one - at least that's what I have."""

25,14,>I don't know if I should have to wear a mask to protect myself but I can't. I don't care if my mask works.
27,14,"I'm a big anti AIDS activist, but this sounds pretty stupid. They're talking about anti AIDS. Vaccines are a threat to human health, not protecting people."
32,14,The NSA is threatening to shut down the military for the rest of its existence. Is this in the ACA or not?
38,14,"It's not a joke, it's a joke."
59,14,">Is it possible that they were trying to cover up the problem by using an acronym, or is this something that the person in this sub are being extremely rude. Vaccines are not the right, you should not have to do it."
60,14,Because they aren't putting people at risk. The fact that someone has HIV or any reversible disease is a rip off of the actual facts. The people at the school who don't think that would be an issue to address.
67,14,CANNOTANSWER:
75,14,"So when a reporter in Vermont calls this a joke, it's not true. You know, as someone in Connecticut who grew up in Vermont, you can be as depressed as you want to be. The government is actually promoting this behavior. You don't know the situation but you're likely not going to have a good time. It's not about the government, but about the federal government."
78,14,">When you get sick, you have to put on a mask. This is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
100,14,"Well, I'd like to thank you for explaining how a mask is not good for you because it can't help you if you're allergic."
14,3,"CANNOTANSWER: Vaccines are not the right, you should not have to do it. Because they aren't putting people at risk. The fact that someone has HIV or any reversible disease is a rip off of the actual facts. The people at the school who don't think that would be an issue to address."
14,4,"They need to protect themselves, but they don't. Isn't that an example of a ridiculous ad?"
14,6,"So when a reporter in Vermont called this a joke, it's not true."
14,9,I can't think of anything else to say than I'm a big anti-AIDS activist and I don't think I've ever seen this ad.
17,14,The film is a rogue movie.
18,14,This is what is about to be reported - the people who wear masks are actually trying to take away some of their rights.
19,14,"People just don't wear masks, they're just wearing it to prevent the spread of the virus."
25,14,I think that the ACA is a major mistake because it is a shithole and a big issue.
27,14,Vaccines do not stop the spread of a virus.
32,14,I would be a little worried that it is illegal for a NSA to shut down the military if it had a reason to.
38,14,"I've been with the government for almost three years now. I screamed at the 'death to an entire government.' but no. It's not the same thing, just a joke."
59,14,"The first part of the article isn't titled ""Another Thing, We Can't Take Care of It""."
60,14,"Vaccines are not necessary to stop a virus. The mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. The people are actually being a little bit of a bullshit here. I know, right? Vaccines are not the right. You should not have to do it. You shouldn't have a medical necessity to do it. Isn't it just a thing of the past where a man has a reversible disease and a medical mask?"
67,14,"It was only the government's job to stop the spread of AIDS. It's just part of the solution, and the government does not want to make it stop. It's a bad idea, but it's not even a bad one."
75,14,"Is it not a big deal that the government is trying to make it illegal, which is misleading because they are promoting falsehoods that will help stop the spread of a virus."
78,14,>This is all part of why you can't buy a helmet.
100,14,>I'm just reading this so I can understand why you're being a dick.
14,3,Vaccines are not the right. You should not have to do it. Because they aren't putting people at risk. The fact that someone has HIV or any reversible disease is a rip off of the actual facts.
14,4,It's ridiculous. This is not even a joke.
14,6,What does a shithole and a shithole in the first place?
14,9,"It's kind of sad. But, people who are actually being a little bit of a dick for a very hard-core politician, have been a big part of the problem since it's been about the government for a decade. It's too late to take responsibility."
17,14,"Well, a few of the things that you're talking about are not related. The one thing you're getting at is the fact that wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. >We need more people like Trump, so people don't take on the role of the president and i mean even if it is not possible to prevent any new violence. he would have been the greatest president ever."
18,14,This explains why you should not be in public for the rest of your life.
19,14,"I don't know about you, but the guy who wrote the article and said he had been vaccinated to prevent the spread of the virus would have told him he would go to the doctor."
25,14,"It's a joke, and it's good to hear it."
27,14,"Well, there's nothing to be ashamed of, and we're not allowed to call them that."
32,14,"If we can't just fuck the ACA, how can we do it?"
38,14,> Putting on a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
59,14,What if you're allergic to something and the NSA doesn't pay you for the vaccine?
60,14,I'm assuming it was done in 2012 by a student from the school.
67,14,So you're going to be a tyrant?
75,14,The government is also trying to get the government to do more to stop the spread of AIDS.
78,14,"Yes, you can buy a mask if you are not wearing it. You don't need a mask if you are deaf."
100,14,What's the point of wearing a mask?
14,3,I've been in a class where I wore a mask to avoid the virus.
14,4,">He is going to ask the other guy this: Why do people keep wearing a mask in their car and out of public places? Because I mean I have been to the top of the twitchcon board in a couple days?"", ""I'm glad the government hasn't rolled over. There hasn't been an attack on public health in nearly a decade. /r/politics got something like this recently."", ""Well, they're not the government, and they don't have the authority to enforce any laws on them."", ""I'm"
14,6,"Because if this is the only one whose comprehensibleness is affected by this issue and that's not the situation, the government is going to have the power to go after those people and make sure that's what they want. They are trying to do all kinds of stupid things."
14,9,It's also kind of weird that they have to pay a company that sends people a copy of their personal information on a plane.
17,14,">We need more people like Trump, so people don't take on the role of the president and i mean even if it is not possible to prevent any new violence. he would have been the greatest president ever."
18,14,"I'm really glad the guy isn't even going to be elected to be a president. It's all about safety. If he's not wearing a mask, then he shouldn't be doing so, but it's still dangerous to a lot of people, particularly in public."
19,14,I've been working on a vaccine that stops me from falling into a coma and being bitten. I have to put on the mask and keep it out of my mouth.
25,14,"The only problem is that the guy that said the joke was 'hey if I'm not wearing a mask when I'm not in bed, I will just put on my mask'. He isn't really saying it was an ACA joke. That's a joke."
27,14,"That would probably be an easy way to get the people to laugh, especially as the government isn't going to listen. It's the same in a few ways:"
32,14,"The ACA does nothing to stop people from wearing masks - unless you are in the minority or have a history of having that problem, and that isn't actually a problem at all. The problem is the ACA is a problem with the ACA."
38,14,I think it's kind of ironic the NSA has been so focused on the ACA.
59,14,">He voted to take a mask off. He didn't even bother to look for one, he was still very disappointed."
60,14,It's just this story... I can't believe the president is in the White House.
67,14,The president is trying to get rid of any form of health care. The president is a tyrant.
75,14,"Vaccinations and AIDS have no problem in their own right. The fact is, it can't hurt to prevent it. Is there any way that a group can get a patient to have a test in the event of an outbreak?"
78,14,In this case it's just a joke.
100,14,Well you're saying you do not like wearing a mask because it's uncomfortable and you don't think that's a sign of insecurity?
14,3,"""I love the idea that you're a woman in a mask because it makes them feel bad about doing something that they don't actually do."""
14,4,>I'm glad the government hasn't rolled over. There hasn't been an attack on public health in nearly a decade.
14,6,He doesn't seem to think of the ACA as a legitimate threat to public health. It's a very bad idea. He's not doing anything bad.
14,9,"They don't fuck with a group like this, so I'm surprised that they won't give out any more than 10 percent of the money they spend to get the people to wear them."
17,14,The president could have been president.
18,14,I've actually got to say that I'm very fond of the word'medical necessity'.
19,14,">If I ever woke up at night with a cold, and I saw someone wear a mask, I would put on a mask and keep it out of my mouth."
25,14,The best thing to do is to wear it.
27,14,"It is the people, not the government, that are making jokes about AIDS. They are not a threat to human health."
32,14,Is this a problem of the ACA?
38,14,"I have no idea what you mean. If you look at this guy with the big shithead name, he's actually a stupid person, and you want to do it like that, just ignore it."
59,14,So... the president is the problem?
60,14,"You're actually being a little bit of a bullshit here. I know, right? Vaccines are not necessary to stop a virus. The mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
67,14,So you're going to be a tyrant?
75,14,I think you're missing some good points in the title of the whole thing.
78,14,"I was in a similar situation with a friend who was on a road trip and asked us to go, ""What's a prank?"" We were all in a prank that didn't include any part of the vaccine. The problem is that we can't know the difference, so we just have to be prepared."
100,14,>I am just reading this so I can understand why you're being a dick. I think it's time to start thinking more critically.
14,3,"If the ""meh"" wasn't a rip off, it wouldn't be a prank."
14,4,'What is a prank?' is the one where the president was asked why this guy was not in a mask.
14,6,He doesn't know what a prank is or what it is.
14,9,"""I hate to be the guy who is on an AIDS ad. The only thing I've heard from you is that you've made a bunch of money on a little joke."
17,14,"I don't like the term ""oh, the mask isn't needed."" But ""oh, the mask is needed,"" the quote isn't. It's just a joke."
18,14,"> I think it's a joke, it's a joke. The American people are not against the ACA."
19,14,I like people who don't wear masks in public because they have no immunity to the virus. I don't know why people wear them but people who wear them are not a joke.
25,14,The best thing to do is to wear it. Vaccinating and keeping people safe is a big red flag in the USA.
27,14,It's actually not a prank. It's a joke. The fact that the CDC is on a pedestal is a major issue.
32,14,"It is a problem of the ACA, but it does not stop people from wearing masks, especially when they are in the minority. I know the president is an opportunistic dictator."
38,14,"In order to support the ACA, it must be a violation of the laws governing it. The ACA is a federal law that doesn't have a mandate to protect individuals, it's just that it's not mandated and if it's going to prevent that, it can be implemented by the ACA."
59,14,"Well, if you're allergic to anything the NSA tries to cover up the issue."
60,14,"It was a joke, but that is not what it's about."
67,14,The only repercussion of the ACA is the fact that the government is trying to stop AIDS and people are getting a lot of pain from preventing the virus.
75,14,The government needs to do the right thing for a reason.
78,14,I thought it was going to be very serious and I didn't want to be a fool.
100,14,>Is he wearing a mask because he feels like a dick or because he doesn't think that's a sign of insecurity?
14,3,A prank in a prank where someone puts on a mask and pretends they know a trick is a prank?
14,4,What is a joke? You don't like a prank. You don't like a prank.
14,6,"You don't want to know what is a prank, you want to know what isn't a prank."
14,9,"That was the joke. If you were to say that he would never wear a mask, the problem would be that he has a mask in his mouth and that is a sign of insecurity."
17,14,"In this context, the word is a joke."
18,14,We aren't getting rid of it. This is the problem. It is not about the health care system.
19,14,"I feel the same about some of my colleagues being offended at this and then going on to say that they haven't been on a plane to the UK in five years, I can understand the lack of empathy. They don't understand how people feel or what their roles are."
25,14,"... unless we don't have an AIDS outbreak, the mask doesn't work. I don't think the ACA is a joke."
27,14,This is how I find the jokes.

38,14,Putting on a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
59,14,I don't think it would make much sense for a politician to wear a mask to prevent the spread of a virus. They want to prevent the spread of HIV by infecting people with HIV. They would also need to pay for vaccinations if they would want to.

59,14,"Vaccines are not the right, you should not have to do it."
60,14,Vaccines are not necessary to stop a virus.
67,14,"The government wants to stop the spread of AIDS, and you can't make a choice. The people in this video are not saying they're going to have a problem with the ACA.

75,14,"I'm not sure what kind of law is being read. But to be fair, we have a few exceptions to law."

25,14,"Are you a Christian? If you're an American, I'd be a bit confused."
27,14,The CDC is trying to pass an ACA without the consent of an Australian doctor. It is not a joke.
32,14,This was the kind of joke that came out when he was a presidential candidate.
38,14,A nut job. He doesn't have anything to do with it. He is going to be the president.
59,14,This is what is going on in the USA.

67,14,"Because the people in this video don't want to be in a conversation about it. They want to hear it. They want to know if anyone who would be in that conversation is in danger of getting the virus, even if it is a health issue."

25,14,"I think people want to know about the health care system, but not that people want to be sarcastic."
27,14,And to not say it's a joke is a prank
32,14,"He's an opportunist dictator. The ACA is not the issue of him, it's the problems of people who believe he's trying to change the world."
38,14,This is the way I understand it. He's a dick who thinks it's a joke.
59,14,"'I like you, but I don't have to wear a mask to prevent the spread of a virus.'"
60,14,I know that a lot of people don't understand what the ACA means. We need to put the mask on every single person in the world. Vaccines aren't the right. You shouldn't have to do it. You should not have a medical necessity to do it.
67,14,If you want to go to the White House you can go to r/health/hybrids to see this video (it's free).
75,14,Vaccines are an important and effective tool for preventing the spread of a virus.

14,3,"It's the government's responsibility to protect its employees if it's necessary for the public to take care of a person who is sick because of a mask.

14,4,Vaccines are an important and effective tool for preventing the spread of a virus.
14,6,"I think it's a pretty good idea for some people, but I think that's probably why they don't wear masks."
14,9,"Vaccines aren't a ""right"" and the president can choose to use them."
17,14,"''Wait, is it really not a joke,'' is it really the gist of a joke?"
18,14,So here is an interesting and funny article about this guy.
19,14,CANNOTANSWER'S a writer who has written about the CDC and a movie about HIV in particular.
25,14,There is no real point in the book unless you really are talking about it. That's why people aren't telling us.
27,14,"The CDC's attempt to pass a federal health care bill without the consent of an Australian doctor is not a prank, it's a joke."
32,14,I'm very familiar with this sub.
38,14,"The word ""judge"" is not being used properly in some countries."
59,14,"Well, that's only a joke, I don't know what to think to that. I am not gonna lie, there is a lot going on in the US, so I wouldn't trust the media to make a whole story about the president wanting to wear a mask."
60,14,The CDC is talking about the need to get the CDC and FDA into action.
67,14,"No, he's saying that the ACA is not an attempt to stop AIDS, because it's a symptom of a very complex virus. It's not a disease. It's not a virus. It's not a virus. It is not the disease. It is not the virus."
75,14,I read a few of the other comments in this comment section.
78,14,It was a joke. It's a joke because the ACA does not address the problem of the virus.
100,14,"So the first thing I said, ""This is an extremely common mental health issue and I think it is very dangerous to wear a mask and the first thing I thought of was it? I think it sounds like I've got a lot of thoughts about that I'm getting through this."
14,3,I think he's right.
14,4,>We need to wear masks and get them vaccinated.
14,6,"CANNOTANSWER: I'm a huge fan of the CDC, but not the CDC itself. The CDC is a government agency. The CDC is a government agency."
14,9,That's a big joke. This is a joke.
17,14,"As a Republican, I'm surprised the obama administration has not been working on this. I think the problem is the fact that this is a joke and isn't something they're able to stop."
18,14,... You're being an asshole and I'm a troll. I am a troll and I can only get the recitation if you think that I think this is about a prank. I would really like to know how to avoid that stuff.
19,14,CANNOTANSWER is a writer who has written about the CDC and a movie about HIV in particular. The movie is about how the ACA is intended to prevent the spread of AIDS.
25,14,"I have a very large body of work, with lots of good people. I've never even read anything about the ACA or the ACA, but I do know about the ACA and how it affects my work life."
27,14,"It's an attempt to stop the spread of HIV. I'm a public health officer who wears a mask in public. I volunteered for a program called ""Pure Public Health"" and was told that the CDC and CDC must put pressure on anyone with a virus to change their behaviors and practices."
32,14,>I think the point of the article is to bring the issue of the president and its agenda into line with the agenda of the Obama administration. I think that it's kinda hard for the players and the media to make any connections to the real issue unless the president is a troll.
38,14,Vaccination is a huge issue for Americans who don't have an idea of what it means to live in America.
59,14,">The first part of the article isn't titled ""Another Thing, We Can't Take Care of It"".', ""What if you're allergic to something and the NSA doesn't pay you for the vaccine?"", """
60,14,That's an interesting way to use the word 'cannabis'.
67,14,"A good part of the reason the government is trying to keep AIDS is because people don't understand it, and their fear that they won't have the chance to tell anyone."
75,14,"I can't imagine the government is promoting a joke in terms of AIDS vaccines and vaccinations. But then again, the ACA was passed in 2008 and you don't owe the people the responsibility for this."
78,14,So your comment was a joke?
100,14,"You're taking on the impression that this is an over-the-top ""shame"" that a person can't come up with, and he is being incompetent because he has a very serious and extremely complex condition that has been diagnosed with multiple forms of cancer and that he is suffering from incomprehensible symptoms."
14,3,>We need to wear masks and get them vaccinated.
14,4,"""I thought the first thing I thought of was it?"""
14,6,"It seems that some of those people are assuming that the government is involved. I'd like to add that these are people with a very complex and complex condition. But if you get a bad idea for the disease, it's a joke."
14,9,"I just had to be told that, while I understand how this is a joke, it is not the ACA, not the ACA."
17,14,This is a joke that has no context. But it does make it sound a bit unfunny. The CDC is a monopoly. The ACA is not a crime. People who wear them aren't allowed to do it. It's the government that has the power to make it illegal.
18,14,"That's the joke, OP. It's not a joke. It's just a joke. It's not a joke, it's a joke. I've been in a lot of different contexts about AIDS."
19,14,I read the article. What makes the joke funny is if I don't know what the joke is.
25,14,>the best thing to do is to wear it. Vaccinating and keeping people safe is a big red flag in the USA.
27,14,I'm not a doctor.
32,14,"There are a lot of interesting things in this sub, like how the ""Mask a Man"" book is about the CDC's policy to stop the spread of the virus. The author is so well known that they've all tried to scoff at people for ""fucking the ACA"" and ""if they can't just fuck the ACA, how can we do it?"""
38,14,Vaccination is a huge issue for Americans who don't have an idea of what it means to live in America. That is the biggest issue in this country.
59,14,"So, there is a joke about this one?"
60,14,It's like a joke.
67,14,What a witty question.
75,14,">I read the article referencing a ""Crime"" from a CDC official in the late 90s, which was basically a reference to a ""We have a right to refuse to give us the mask. It is also the right to keep us out of our state and into the national public eye."
78,14,"I think the people at DHS - the doctors and govt are a little off-putting. The fact that someone in that position can be a dick and a joke doesn't make him a dick, they can make someone laugh at them."
100,14,"He's putting his self worth above others. He's not being an asshole, and he's being a dick."
14,3,This is so much more relevant to this sub and I’ve read a bunch of very interesting things about this. What makes it funny is if I don’t know what the joke is.
14,4,"I don't think anyone's going to think that this is a joke. There is just too much information to keep the word 'common sense' around, and as the author's explanation suggests, this isn't a joke."
14,6,I read the whole article. I think the best thing to do is to wear it. Vaccinating and keeping people safe is a big red flag in the USA. I'm not a doctor.
14,9,"The CDC has an important role to play. Vaccination and preventing people from getting AIDS can not be a monopoly. There is no such thing as a ""privilege"" to be applied to any ACA product."
17,14,Is the CDC just as bad as a government agency in that regard? Because the CDC is in charge of the ACA.
18,14,I don't know what a good example of that would be. That's how I think a sarcastic joke is written.
19,14,"'If I ever woke up with a cold, and I saw someone wear a mask, I would put on a mask and keep it out of my mouth.'"
25,14,>The best thing to do is to wear it. Vaccinating and keeping people safe is a big red flag in the USA.
27,14,I volunteered for an anti AIDS charity that has no restraining order. They will probably be able to get people to accept the same rules.
32,14,"I'm a little embarrassed because I don't believe the people that voted for the ACA will say 'no'. It's a shame that it is a major issue, and that the ACA is the most important one of those issues."
38,14,"As a former president who's tried to make a joke about Vaccination, I find it ridiculous that the CDC and the Obama administration don't care a bit about the vaccines. The joke is a joke, a prank, and it should be considered a morality joke. The point being that he has an awful attitude and the only thing he can do is numb himself. The movie is satire."
59,14,A shit fucking post about the CIA and FDA trying to cover up a shit joke?
60,14,"The school is still in a little bit of a state with one of the best gov'ts in the world in terms of government, so the government should be able to take it to a different level, like saying:"

75,14,CANNOTANSWER'S BAD PARTY: Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
78,14,Is this a joke from a movie written by an AIDS survivor?

17,14,It's a joke. The CDC is not a government agency.
18,14,The NSA isn't trying to stop the spread of AIDS. The CDC isn't using that to stop that. This is not about the ACA. The ACA is not about the ACA. This is about the AIDS epidemic.
19,14,"""The truth"" is the joke that makes a person think they're an evil dude and do nothing but make the person look stupid."
25,14,Is there a real point in the book that the movie is about?
27,14,"Well, I do work in a healthcare field, so I can't tell you how to do that, but I do know some other people who will have had to work for more than a decade."

32,14,"It's not like the author is a racist and that's the point. This is a joke about a guy who's been playing with the president all his life, and it's not about whether he's a good person or a bad person, but more about why people have never gotten sick of him."
38,14,"That's exactly what I meant when I said it, but in the context of that article, I'd say the President has a problem with it. I find it ridiculous that a joke is being made by a politician. And yet people claim he is a prick for being a prankster."

14,3,"I'm from California and the person I spoke with said something like, ""Wait, I'm sick, I have to go back to school in my own time."""
14,4,He doesn't know what to say or say in a good way.

14,9,"CANNOTANSWER, a CDC employee, is one of the few who can prank on the govt president."
17,14,The movie is an interesting read. What kind of commenters do you see who are in that thread?
18,14,Are you gonna lie to me?
19,14,A large number of the responses on this sub are just that: *Did you know how crazy trump made the United States of America?*
25,14,"It's also in the book titled ""Ask the government about this."" That's a pretty good read."
27,14,You read a bunch of jokes in a nutshell.
32,14,The problem with ACA is that it's a joke about a government and the government's agenda.
38,14,So that he's trying to stop HIV? I think that's a joke because he doesn't believe it's a joke.
59,14,I like that movie. It's a movie.
60,14,I've been in the White House for over 6 years. I always have my apologies.
67,14,"The article's about the President and it's agenda, which has no place in the policy of the Obama administration."
75,14,CANNOTANSWER'S BAD PARTY: Wearing a medical mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. The book is about how government has made this mess and they should be ashamed for it.
78,14,">The president doesn't have a problem with the ACA. He's getting involved in the ACA and is taking the title. I think the problem with this is that if we don't have a mask in the classroom, there's no chance we'll be able to make it a joke. It seems like the board is too busy announcing what is being done to stop the spread of a virus."
100,14,"It is a serious illness, which is very difficult to get a diagnosis and prevent, and has the stigma attached to it. You are not a deceiver. He needs to be told how, and that is what he needs."
14,3,The ACA is actually a rip off.
14,4,"I didn't know that the ACA wasn't rolled over as a joke, but it is certainly a joke. The CDC isn't going to repeal it until after the ACA is passed because of the deafness of the deaf."
14,6,"""Also if you get a bad idea for the disease, it's a joke."""
14,9,The CDC is trying to use it to stop the spread of AIDS and the ACA.
17,14,CDC isn't a monopoly. It's the CIA that's a monopoly. The CIA is a monopoly.
18,14,> I'm not just an expert on the US healthcare system
19,14,"CANNOTANSWER'S BAD PARTY: Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. In all fairness, that's not what a CIA agent wants to be in. The ACA is a great prank. It's not a joke. It's not a joke, it's a prank. The ACA aims to destroy the healthcare system. A large number of the responses on this sub are just that:"
25,14,"The movie was great, but the movie didn't fit into the genre I prefer."
27,14,I don't know why someone isn't reeking of the word joke. I would say this isn't a joke. The word joke isn't a prank. I don't think it's funny.
32,14,"> ""I'm not sure if anyone here is aware of this. The president is not at fault for the spread of the virus, but he is at fault for not wearing a mask at all."""
38,14,"CANNOTANSWER, a former president, is trying to make a joke about the ACA. I read an article that says that a'major issue' is a'major issue' - people believe the ACA to be a joke."
59,14,A lot of people think that the ACA is a joke. The article seems to say that the ACA isn't very regulated in Australia. It's part of the existing system. A lot of people have no idea what the ACA is about.
60,14,I don't think we need more of this if it is a joke.
67,14,"Yes, it's a problem. The problem is that people don't know, and it's difficult to tell what that is because they're getting sick. They have to keep it under control to keep it at bay. If you want to fight AIDS, you need a mask and get a new one."
75,14,"I'm sorry to hear that, but the CDC is also trying to make the ACA a public health care initiative. It's in the works, but I'm more interested in what's being promoted by the government."
78,14,"It's like how the president made a joke because he wanted to protect the poor. He also wanted the kids to be aware that if they did not like it, they would have to do something about it."
100,14,So this is why I am a girl. It's not a bad idea to make a remark.

14,9,Are you really fucking interested in the ACA?

18,14,"""I think it's a joke, it's a joke. It's just a joke."""
19,14,"[NAME] explains why he wore a mask in the first place, explains why he would put it on after seeing someone on the bus."
25,14,"Unless they make a movie about it, I don't think the ACA is a joke."
27,14,It’s a prank.
32,14,"if it were a joke then the ACA would have been a joke, not a prank."
38,14,Is it the government's job to stop AIDS? Certainly not a joke.
59,14,It's a joke. The story is being read as a joke because it is about a presidential hat. That's about the ACA and not the ACA.
60,14,"People don't know what the ACA means. They want to protect people, but they don't know the full story. The ACA is just a joke."
67,14,I have a feeling the current government isn't really doing anything but trying to prevent or prevent spread of AIDS.
75,14,"Vaccines are a problem that is not going to be solved if all that has changed since ACA was passed. Vaccines have no problem, and a mask would not be enough. There's also no one single thing that the CDC is going to do about it, unless it makes it illegal for the public to have them."
78,14,I don't really think they need to make it a joke to save the child who is sick.
100,14,"I'd get an ER check, I wouldn't wear one because the stigma doesn't get the message across. I just think that in order to combat this, a mask is going to help. I am sure he's trying to help others, but he's not."
14,3,">It's a joke. It's a joke, because I'm a citizen of one of the most corrupt and corrupt government parties in the world."
14,4,That guy is being made fun of as a joke by a group of guys he says likes to wear masks to prevent infection - if he doesn't use the mask he's going to die - but when he uses a mask that's a bad idea.
14,6,What is a prank?
14,9,The CDC is doing a lot of things to help and a lot of things that are pranks.
17,14,I would read more than a couple of your replies to the last part.
18,14,"The book ""A prank is a joke that doesn't exist and isn't about pranks, but a joke."""
19,14,I don't think the ACA's a good prank. It is the best thing to do. It's not a joke but it's a great prank.
25,14,"A prank is a joke, not a joke."

32,14,"[Sir], I'm in no way a racist."
38,14,"The CDC has been involved with the ACA for years, and there are a lot of people who think they're just being a prick."
59,14,"In the ACA itself, it's just a joke."
60,14,I don't like Obama because I want it. But I don't think he's being a little bit sexist.
67,14,The article states that he wants to make it so that people don't get infected. But he is not an official spokesperson. It doesn't appear in the article.
75,14,"If this is a CDC article that isn't written by a doctor, it isn't the CDC. If it's written by a politician, it is not the CDC. It's a government-approved ACA."
78,14,This has been around for years. I still have a few memories of me having a big mouth when I saw this movie. I had a hard time believing it was a prank.
100,14,It sounds like the guy is trying to be a good friend by referring to him as a sex addict. I think it's time to start thinking more critically.
14,3,A bunch of pranks? It seems like the ACA was never actually a joke.
14,4,The title is in the wrong sentence.
14,6,"The CDC can't tell you if you were in the ACA, but it could be written by a doctor and the CDC can tell you what a prank is."

17,14,I don't like the title. It's kind of a joke because I think it's funny because I don't understand why people think it's a prank.
18,14,You are correct. I don't want to talk about the joke. I know it's just a prank.
19,14,"I think this is a good prank, because it's so stupid to know that this is a prank."

27,14,The CDC is going to get the same type of people involved in it because it is a joke. They are a government entity. They do not like to listen to a joke and they are not going to allow this kind of stuff to happen.

75,14,The CDC is not going to stop AIDS.

32,14,It's pretty much the president who is trying to change a country. You can't even fuck the president. The president is trying to change the country. And he is trying to change it. This is not a joke.
38,14,... So that's a joke?
59,14,Why can't we just give the President the option of choosing a different title? The article is misleading.

14,3,Vaccines are an invasive treatment. A mask will only be used if it’s a prank.
14,4,I'm still in shock that this is the first ACA campaigner to say that it's a joke.
14,6,"I'm a big fan of the CDC, but not the CDC itself. The CDC is a government agency. The CDC is a government agency. The CDC is a government agency. The CDC is a government agency. The CDC is a government agency."
14,9,They have not been on the ACA for a while.
17,14,It's not a prank. It's a joke.
18,14,You are saying the ACA isn't going to do anything about the AIDS epidemic. The ACA is going to do nothing about that.
19,14,I'm not sure I feel that the ACA is a prank but I do believe it is a prank.
25,14,This is a great movie. It is an excellent read.
27,14,It's funny because they're not even on a pedestal at the moment.
32,14,"What do you mean by a joke, a joke?"
38,14,I’ve been here a long time.
59,14,The article is about the president wanting to wear a mask. It's a joke. The article is about the president trying to cover up the issue. The article seems to say that the ACA isn't very regulated in Australia. It's part of the existing system. A lot of people aren't aware of what the ACA is about.
60,14,I am a Republican. We have to do this - and you can do it.
67,14,"The whole idea of the ACA is to help those who have HIV and not get infected, which is the worst part of it."
75,14,"I just want to say that I'm not going to be a member of the CDC, I don't want them to be the part that is making me uncomfortable. I want them to be the part that causes the situation, rather than the one that causes the problems."
78,14,I don't have a question.
100,14,"It's not a mental illness. It's a serious illness, and it can be treated. It has a high frequency, and is very hard to diagnose and treat. You can get tested with a medical doctor but it's a very difficult one to prevent and treat. It's very difficult to know how to administer the medication."
14,3,Vaccines are an invasive treatment that people need to take a course in.
14,4,I'm surprised to hear that this is the first ACA campaigner to say that it's a joke.
14,6,CANNOTANSWER:
14,9,"It's the government's job to put on a mask for everyone, not just the govt."
17,14,"So the Obama campaign is a joke, or a prank? The CDC is the government's problem, not the government's problem?"
18,14,"It's a joke about a joke in terms of the fact that the government has used this to stop a virus, and the CDC is not trying to stop it if it does."
19,14,CANNOTANSWER is a writer who has written about the CDC and a movie about HIV in particular.
25,14,The most important issue of the American government is that the CDC is not an official body. It's the best example of a government that wants to be able to prevent diseases like HIV and other diseases. That's why they made the movie a joke.
27,14,I don't know about you but I think you're doing a good job of finding some humor.
32,14,And a joke. The guy is a troll.
38,14,""" I don't think it's a joke. I like to say this:"
59,14,The article isn't about the ACA in Australia. It's about the ACA itself.
60,14,Vaccines are not necessary to stop AIDS because they will not prevent it affecting millions of people a year
67,14,Because the government is trying to make AIDS go away. It doesn't stop it. And yet the ACA has an effect on the economy. There's no reason to continue with it.
75,14,"Vaccines are not a problem. People 'deserve' it and they should look it up, but the ""non-descriptiveness"" is only an example of what does not constitute a disease."

17,14,So the CDC is a prank? Those are good jokes.
18,14,I don't understand you at all. It's a joke about a government in place. It's not about the ACA. It's about the ACA. It's about the ACA.
19,14,The article does not even mention that he is an attempt at a prank. The article is actually about how the ACA is intended to prevent the spread of HIV.

32,14,"The ACA is a joke, not a joke. That's a joke.'It is a joke."
38,14,I think the most important thing to remember about the ACA is that it's the ACA that preventing the spread of the disease.
59,14,"Well, I'm not sure if you're a huge Republican or not, but a Senator. In my experience, Democrats and Republicans are usually very unbiased and rational about this issue.

100,14,>It seems to me that wearing a mask is making him feel ashamed.
14,3,"""We need to wear a mask and get them vaccinated."""
14,4,This is the exact kind of prank that makes sense to me. There is no point in not having a real reason to wear a mask. I think it's a joke that people should have to think about when they say a joke isn't a joke.
14,6,I don't think that is really a good example. There's no way you can get a prank without a hat.
14,9,“People who are actually being a little bit of a dick for a very hard-core politician. They would never wear a mask.

18,14,It's a joke about the government and the ACA. You don't even know what a joke is. The fact that it is a joke tells you you can't make a joke about the health care system. You need to stop thinking about that.

38,14,So your point here is not really correct.
59,14,I'd say the Obama Administration is the right person to protect people's rights. But the President isn't the one who is telling you what is actually going on in the United States. That's where the joke comes from.

59,14,Is there a whole thread on reddit about a joke that you haven't heard about?
60,14,You can do whatever you want with the ACA. Vaccines don't make it necessary and you shouldn't need a medical necessity to do it.

17,14,What is the purpose of the ACA?
18,14,That's not even the joke.
19,14,CANNOTANSWER is a writer who has written about the CDC and a movie about HIV in particular. The movie is about how the ACA is intended to destroy the healthcare system.
25,14,"The author has stated it is the best way to prevent HIV, and the CDC is an official body."
27,14,CANNOTANSWER is an agnostic cynicism who thinks that he's a dick and a joke is funny.
32,14,The ACA is the most important issue in American history. That and I are happy that there is no problem.
38,14,He could actually help you get your shit together and get the CDC to stop a viral infection.
59,14,"I've never been so obtuse with the ACA that I'd be able to see a joke on this sub because I was one of the first to see it. The first time I ever woke up a child I had a heart attack and couldn't even read it. Until now, I've been able to watch the movie, and I can understand how it came off. But you seem to be a cynic and I'm the president."
60,14,Why isn't the president putting the mask on the entire student body? That's a joke.
67,14,The'shame' is more about 'not keeping the people infected' than the 'right to get a mask'. It's not about 'keeping people infected'. It's about 'the people who have HIV and don't want to go to the doctor to get it'.
75,14,A CDC policy and its purpose is to protect people from getting HIV/Aids and reduce the spread of the virus. The ACA has to be the one that will prevent that.
78,14,"I've never seen a prank, it just takes out the whole ACA joke, it's not a prank, it's a joke."
100,14,I'm afraid you're only hearing a few phrases to get your head around:

78,14,I like how that makes people nervous but it doesn't really bother me that people can actually think about the ACA and make jokes about the problem. The problem of the ACA is not whether or not it addresses the problem.

14,9,I think this is a bit of a bogus claim to be false. People are being pranks on the government. It's more of a 'fun' and a joke than a real joke. There's also a lot of things that are being taken in general in the context of the ACA.
17,14,"In the film: The government is an agency which uses people to sabotage the ACA. The government does not sabotage the ACA. It is an agency, not a monopoly."
18,14,I'm not a troll.
19,14,ACA is a prank because the government is trying to stop the spread of AIDS. The CDC is doing something very good to get the CDC to stop the spread of AIDS. It's a prank.
25,14,The book says it is a prank and is called an AIDS joke.
27,14,The only person who can tell a joke is the person he's speaking to when he's speaking to him. He doesn't seem like a joke.

59,14,I've noticed this in an old article on a couple of years ago where one of the presidents walked up to the CDC and told them a joke about the ACA. It made sense to me.

67,14,>The article seems to be about a racist conspiracy to try and stop the ACA.
75,14,"""But then again, the ACA was passed in 2008 and you don’t owe the people the responsibility for this."""
78,14,I'm not sure that's a good enough excuse to make the ACA a joke. The article is simply a joke in context and I'd not even consider it a prank unless you can get it from someone that can't see your face if it's a joke.
100,14,"He isn't being incompetent to tell others. He's trying to put the person at ease in a very independant way. If this was a mental illness, would anyone want to help someone with an autoimmune disease?"
