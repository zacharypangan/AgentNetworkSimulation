35,6,This is a real thing.
35,7,"I was also wearing a mask in the summer while visiting a friend who went to his cousins, and his friend said they did not feel safe or comforting when they were wearing their masks. It was hard to understand and not very fun, but that was the point of my trip."
35,12,So you are wearing a mask to protect yourself from a virus? Are you saying it is a hard time breathing?
35,16,"i'm sorry he didn't vote against it, what is the state bringing to the debate"
35,18,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
35,24,"No one wants to talk about that, but people want to talk about it, and then you can get mad about it too."

38,35,This was a very interesting comment and a great read. I wish we could put this in more articles if we could.
57,35,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
65,35,"They are both for the safety of the people, and they are for the right of others to fuck with people like you and me."
69,35,In fact I don't understand that saying'says the woman that wears the mask to protect herself' is wrong.
82,35,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. Says the woman that wears the mask to protect herself
88,35,Is that a question that gets answered all the time?
94,35,"And if he's not wearing his mask in public, what's the problem?"
35,3,Wearing a mask to protect yourself is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
35,5,"I don't like to be around other people. If you get out of the way with someone, talk to them."
35,6,"The problem is that people still don't understand the value of the ""what I was wearing"" thing. They only like the 'what I was wearing'."
35,7,"I'm sorry he didn't vote against it, what is the state bringing to the debate."
35,12,"I m not going to start talking about the topic of wearing a mask, but I am willing to bet a little bit more on that and how the people who wear it are too scared of it."
35,16,"I don't understand why people wear a mask, they wear it as a mask to protect themselves and to make themselves feel better."
35,18,I think this is a good way to look at it.
35,24,"...and if he's not wearing his mask in public, what's the problem?"
35,30,I can't believe you're just trying to be a little harsh here.
35,32,What is a gif that mentions the government sending in a fake tampon to kill people?
35,34,It is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
38,35,I can't stand using a mask to go through restaraunts.
57,35,"I have to be honest. I know that you would be a little worried about the people who get sick from wearing masks. I'm not saying that a mask is good, but that a mask can be good."
65,35,We have a public health agency that is an agency. We don't get to make any decisions at all in a government system. It's a tool to help prevent people from getting sick and also to encourage citizens to be proactive.
69,35,This is so ridiculous and ridiculous it is like a rant from a tv station :( The same goes for a cd to be able to aerect a small hole in your neck and put it under the gun in order to stop the spread of a virus. I had to wear a mask to protect myself.
82,35,"I know you're not against these mandates, but I think OP is wrong. There are no statutory mandates that make them illegal."
88,35,I was vaccinated. I wore a mask when I went to twitchcon. I was very vaccinated.
94,35,"This is the most common misconception I've encountered in any public health situation - the lack of a health care provider who cares enough to do all of the right things without needing a mask. I would also say that when you are being denied a choice, you don't have a choice."
35,3,I can't stand using a mask to go through restaraunts. I have to be honest.
35,5,"The problem with wearing a mask is that it is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. I'm sorry he didn't vote against it, what is the state bringing to the debate."
35,6,"I do not want to be harsh, but I'd say that in a good way he was making an effort to prevent the spread of a virus, but it does not seem to be working."
35,7,"In this context, the issue is not what OP is wearing."
35,12,"I don't have to be sure, but you said I don't like wearing a mask to protect myself."
35,16,"...and if he's not wearing his mask in public, what's the problem?"
35,18,What is the biggest misconception I've encountered in any public health situation - the lack of a health care provider who cares enough to do all of the right things without needing a mask.
35,24,"You said you were afraid of something. It's a nirvana, not a tampon. A mask isn't a vaccine. It's a vaccination."
35,30,"...and if he's not wearing his mask in public, what's the problem?"
35,32,"I just wanted to add that it's an anti-virus and it seems like I've been getting sick from wearing it in the past. I've heard so many different stories about this in my own life, and I don't want to say that I know exactly what the problem is because I've been vaccinated or not, but the mask sucked because it's so small and it didn't do anything useful. I didn't need it to take care of my health. I didn't even have a mask in my neck and put it under a hand"
35,34,"I think this is a cliche. But people can be raped and killed by the government, and if someone else has no say it's a cliche that they're doing it they're trying to justify the raped, but what they want is to get them into the public eye to get the vaccine that they need."
38,35,There are several reasons why this is stupid. It's one of the most important parts of the U.S. government's strategy to get people to wear a mask to fight an illness. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
57,35,I would say I wear a mask while working in a sick place and have never been able to get sick. :(
65,35,It was just about the CDC. They're the only ones addressing the issue at hand.
69,35,Are you familiar with any of the other statements that were made when this was first published?
82,35,"I think he's right that as soon as someone wears a mask, they are going to have to get it out before the law comes out and the government can't do anything about it."
88,35,"I think if you wanted to get vaccinated and didn't like the way it went, you would be the one doing it. I don't think you deserve to be vaccinated."
94,35,"if you're wearing the same mask and it's a public lawmaker you are going to need to get vaccinated - if you're not wearing the same mask and they aren't, why don't you go to the police and report the problem?"
35,3,">...and if he's not wearing his mask in public, what's the problem?"
35,5,"...and if he's not wearing his mask in public, what's the problem?"
35,6,"If the public doesn't understand what the problem is, then the government will give up."
35,7,They are trying to make sure we can do a public health education and get that out. So I'm going to ask him if he's willing to do that? I'm a citizen so I'm curious.
35,12,This is the third time I've gotten this kind of sarcasm in a comment.
35,16,"I'm sorry, but I'd say that in a good way he was making an effort to prevent the spread of a virus, but it does not seem to be working."
35,18,"When we wear a mask, we get sick from it, and that's when the problem arises."
35,24,"He's getting a retcon at the hospital. It's a lie that the CDC should have not done anything about it, which I believe is what's causing the problem."
35,30,"...and if he's not wearing his mask in public, what's the problem?"
35,32,"The problem with wearing a mask is that it is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. I'm sorry he didn't vote against it, what is the state bringing to the debate."
35,34,It doesn't matter what the law is: you will get a mask.
38,35,I think what's interesting is how people are arguing about it in the comments.
57,35,"It’s also not a big deal, and if you want to get sick it’s better not to wear a mask outside of work."
65,35,> I'm a man who wears a mask all the time to fight cancer and his family.
69,35,"i just read the link, and now i am bored. you are right that there is an indoctrination involving the CDC. they are probably right if you were going to ask about the CDC being used to stop the spread of the virus."
82,35,Nobody's allowed to wear a mask to protect themselves. What is the difference between wearing a mask to protect yourself? What does the law say?
88,35,"I'm not sure what the CDC has to say, but they seem to be adamant on that the government has a good interest in preventing transmission."
94,35,This is a good question because we've got plenty of options for when you need to tell the police you're not ready to talk about it.
35,3,My family is very proud of the fact that they are wearing masks to fight cancer.
35,5,"I've had to wear masks and I couldn't find any. But my apologies. I think I was trying to be a little more realistic. I was getting sick in my work and I feared for my safety. I tried and failed. And while it seems to work, I am a little iffy about the law and how to do a public health education program. It seems like I have never been able to get a vaccinated, despite how great I've become in the past few years. In my position I'm not willing to"
35,6,"> I think if you wanted to get vaccinated and didn't like the way it went, you would be the one doing it. I don't think you deserve to be vaccinated."
35,7,">I'm sorry he didn't vote against it, what is the state bringing to the debate."
35,12,"""This is the third time I've gotten this kind of sarcasm in a comment."""
35,16,"[No, I am not a citizen. This is a question we have. No, I am not a citizen. I am a citizen."
35,18,"There's no reason to wear a mask outside of work without having an inpatient ER, or if you're out of town, getting an appointment to see an intern (ie you don't have to go to the doctor or if you're on vacation), unless your doctor recommends it."
35,24,">I'm sorry he didn't vote against it, what is the state bringing to the debate."
35,30,That is the problem. Not even if the mask was actually used to stop the spread of the virus.
35,32,"I'm so sorry, but I’m afraid I’m actually really close to that. Whenever I look at the internet and hear a post with this exact title, I can see how a lot of people would say the same thing - because they didn’t want to. There is an r/health section somewhere called “The issue with wearing a mask is that it is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. I think if you want to get vaccinated and didn’t like the way it went, you are going"
35,34,">I think this is a cliche. But people can be raped and killed by the government, and if someone else has no say it's a cliche that they're doing it they're trying to justify the raped, but what they want is to get them into the public eye to get the vaccine that they need."", ""It doesn't matter what the law is: you will get a mask."""
38,35,It's very interesting how people are arguing about it. Is this a thing of the past?
57,35,"He was being sarcastic. I can't say that I want to wear a mask outside of work, but I would say I wear a mask outside of work. I don't know why."
65,35,They can't do the things they want without actually needing to. The reason the CDC is ignoring the issue is because it is ineffective and doesn't have the resources necessary to do the right thing.
69,35,"You think it's all about the masks, you think it's a good idea."
82,35,"This is the most downvoted post of all time. The fact that the people in the video here have stated they are against the ACA as the ""main issue"" which is causing many people to suffer AIDS, not just the ACA, so they are against it."
88,35,"I am not sure what you mean by'responsibility'. I believe the point here is that this is a topic of discussion, not a subject of discussion."
94,35,"The only people who'd make a problem with it a question that would come up in my head are the ""people who don't know what their problem is"" and the ""people who don't know what they're doing wrong."
35,3,">I think if you wanted to get vaccinated and didn’t like the way it went, you would be the one doing it. I don’t think you deserve to be vaccinated."
35,5,"I'm a little scared of getting a cold or getting an HIV shot and so I thought if you could see the effects of your mask, you could get vaccinated and get a blood test for that. I am not really worried about being able to get the vaccine, but I can certainly tell you if I need to get a checkup or not, I would like a consultation."
35,6,"I mean, if you want to know if you should be getting vaccinated, you can. I know I have a pretty good feeling, but I'm also not."
35,7,"I can understand why people are arguing, but the actual issue here is not a ""main issue."" The ACA and the government are doing a pretty awful job of preventing the spread of the virus. I think the ACA is a good idea because it works. It's not a thing of the past."
35,12,"In the future unless someone gets sick and dies it may be worth noting that the CDC's response is ""I don't have to be sure, but you said I don't like wearing a mask to protect myself."""
35,16,"I don't think it's a matter of ""responsibility"" at all. It's just that it's part of the government's policy to prevent it from spreading. It doesn't make sense, because that's the only reason they're ignoring it. I don't see why they're not doing what they're doing."
35,18,"I'm gonna go for a lie, and just say that this is one of the most downvoted post of all time."
35,24,"A good thing about a good thing about the ACA, but not because it's a big thing."
35,30,"''What is the problem. Not even if the mask was actually used to stop the spread of the virus.''' ""I can't believe you're just trying to be a little harsh here.""''"

35,34,">I'm sorry he didn't vote against it, what is the state bringing to the debate. That is the problem. Not even if the mask was actually used to stop the spread of the virus."
38,35,YES... it is an old issue and you are not going to make it right.
57,35,"I was at the hospital with a virus that was going to spread to people, and it was very obvious that the doctor wasn't wearing a mask and it was a problem with a virus."
65,35,A school with one or two masks would not get enough support for putting a mask on their students. A school can't get enough support. It's just part of the system.
69,35,> I'm sure if they were working against the CDC they would have been better off as a dick than the CIA. There is a whole subreddit dedicated to this subject and it's about the idea that wearing a mask in public is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
82,35,I would go to a doctor and get a test to see how long this is going to take for a drug test. Then get a prescription.
88,35,People are often confused when people say I don't want to be vaccinated. They think my parents wouldn't have a problem if I wore a mask. I grew up with a guy that got sick and did nothing but dread getting sick. I don't know what he is talking about here.
94,35,> It's just an observation. The problem isn't with the idea. People are not stealing. I'd go and find out what a medical emergency is. The FBI has a big influence on the government. They have a great influence. You just need to get yourself the CDC and CDC's support.
35,3,he doesn't know the definition of'responsibility'. I'm just stating that I don't think the ACA is a good idea. I know that isn't what it really is.
35,5,">I'm sorry he didn't vote against it, what is the state bringing to the debate."", ""...and if he's not wearing his mask in public, what's the problem?"", ""...and if he's not wearing his mask in public, what's the problem?"""
35,6,"Wearing a mask in public is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I am not sure what you mean by ""responsibility""."

There is a whole subreddit dedicated to this topic and it's about the idea that wearing a mask in public is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
35,12,What does a person with an infection have that can be a problem?
35,16,It is the ACA that is making people able to get vaccinated and get blood tests.
35,18,Its only a part of the ACA.
35,24,"OP, if you want to know more about the ACA, there are also a lot of other stuff about it like the CDC. You might be interested in learning about the CDC's support of vaccines '."
35,30,"I'm not sure what he means by ""responsibility""."
35,32,">I believe the point here is that this is a topic of discussion, not a subject of discussion.

35,34,"I have a friend that was a physician at a hospital, I have a blood test with a virulent vaccine and it's not enough for me. She said it would take over 2 months before she would be able to be vaccinated because of the mask. She told me she wanted to be vaccinated. We got a blood test. We got a blood test. It's not really the same as a vaccination, but more like a vaccine. There's a whole lot of people who would come to the CDC'"
38,35,"I am trying to come out with an answer that's as logical as possible. It's a question of ""can a fad be funny or a joke?"""
57,35,"The government in the U.S. is not really a democracy. The president of the US is not a democratically elected leader. If the President of the US was elected, he would be a democratically elected president."
65,35,They aren't tackling the issue and aren't taking it seriously. They are actually doing something to improve the patient experience.
69,35,"There is a bunch of misinformation about this issue, even though this is just a one way street. The government is doing a lot of bad things for the nation."
82,35,People wearing a mask is the biggest problem facing America.
88,35,"Vaccines are a public health issue, but not the most important one in a vaccine. I do not think there's any evidence for it."
94,35,I think they're trying to have a better public health service. We need better public health workers. Until we stop doing the same thing all the time.
35,3,"If you don't want to go to a doctor, get the first thing to check in and get vaccinated. The CDC will take care of that."
35,5,No. In that context I think the problem is that most people don't know what their problem is or don't think a vaccine can stop a virus. So when you say 'I don't like to be vaccinated. They think my parents wouldn't have a problem if I wore a mask. I have to wear masks and I couldn't find any.
35,6,Is this really the point of the discussion? I'm trying to come out with an answer that's as logical as possible.
35,7,I know you are confused. But this seems pretty straight forward. The government and the CDC are doing a pretty awful job of preventing the spread of a virus. The government and the CDC are doing a pretty awful job of preventing the spread of a virus.
35,12,It doesn't matter if a person's problem with the ACA is'short term'. It's really the people and their concerns about health care.
35,16,"The government isn't tackling the issue and aren't taking it seriously. The government is doing a lot of bad things for the nation. People wearing a mask is the biggest problem facing America. Vaccines are a public health issue, but not the most important one in a vaccine."
35,18,>You just need to get yourself the CDC and CDC's support. he doesn't know the definition of'responsibility'. I'm just stating that I don't think the ACA is a good idea.
35,24,I think I figured out the meaning of the whole thing.

35,34,"""Well... I have to avert it."""
38,35,"It's been reported to the CIA and FDA. They are trying to figure out how to protect themselves from the disease. You say you think it's hilarious, and you think it's ridiculous. But this isn't a joke, you say it's the most dangerous thing in the world."
57,35,"I am not an advocate of government, but he should probably do this if he wants to be a dictator."
65,35,"If you can't afford the mask, you should quit wearing it. It's not that you have to wear it, it's that you don't want to be treated like you would any other person."
69,35,The CDC has no intention of allowing people to get vaccinated with AIDS.
82,35,CANNOTANSWER (r-cdc):
88,35,Is it a problem with that and not that the people who don't care about vaccines?
94,35,"I can't even say that a ""bad"" situation does not exist."
35,3,"That sounds quite logical. I agree that it is a bad idea for the CDC and that its government is doing a bad job of preventing the spread of AIDS. I don't care about the ACA, I think it's a good idea. I don't think the ACA is a good idea."
35,5,"I think it's interesting to read about how people wear masks for fear of getting a cold or getting an HIV shot, but not for fear of getting a vaccinated. They can only do so by themselves."
35,6,">Is it a problem with that and not that the people who don't care about vaccines? I can't even say that a ""bad"" situation does not exist."
35,7,You are absolutely right. I think the CDC is not doing any good.
35,12,"You are being a liar, sarcastic."
35,16,"The masks aren't the best way to prevent illness, they're the most efficient way to ward off disease."
35,18,"I don't think you understand that we're talking about the issue of a'short term' problem. People who don't care about AIDS and the government can't afford to go get the mask, and the CDC wants to do something to improve the patient experience."
35,24,I think that he has been doing his job because he thinks he's being a fucking idiot.
35,30,"... The CDC, in order to help keep Americans healthy, need to have a vaccine."
35,32,"The problem is with the idea, not with the answer."
35,34,"i'm sorry he didn't vote against it, what is the state bringing to the debate. That is the problem."
38,35,It's hard to say how we all have it and the issue is the problem. What kind of country do you live in?
57,35,"I don't think the guy is taking the blame, but I'd like him to do what he wants."
65,35,"The question is if anyone can be given a good mask for a health care emergency, but if they can't afford it, they shouldn't wear it."
69,35,"There's no good reason to be concerned with the president's health. If they are the government, they are probably the only agency that can prevent a virus from spreading."
82,35,"They were not just talking about the ACA, the ACA is not a big issue in Australia. It's just a tidbit."
88,35,"I think it's a great idea to have people who actually want to help the CDC do something to help the CDC. Vaccines are not just a vaccine, they are also a hygienic medicine for the people that want to spread the virus."
94,35,"The CDC is part of the NSA, which is what made it a good idea. It says a man in a hood is wearing a mask."
35,3,The whole government is so ill-informed and sarcastic. And the Obama Administration doesn't just support vaccinations in the US and its mandate is to protect people.

35,12,The ACA doesn't exist in Australia. It doesn't exist in Canada.
35,16,I think that 'By having the CDC on your side' is a good start to prevent and prevent spread of HIV.

35,32,That is the problem. It is not about people being able to get themselves the CDC.

65,35,"There is no way you can go out of your way to fight AIDS. You have to go in a mask that is not actually a mask. Vaccines are not a right.

69,35,There is a subreddit dedicated to this topic and it's about the idea that wearing a mask in public is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
82,35,You think it's a problem if your mask is the problem you're talking about?
88,35,"The title just makes you believe that you are the ""most stupid person in the world,"" because of the joke that you are."

35,12,"I don't know, I just know, I'm getting on your nerves."
35,16,"Vaccines are an important part of the human psyche, and as you can see, they are incredibly dangerous. I think the first step is making the people in the US aware of their dangers and their risk of getting HIV.

35,18,It's pretty clear from the title.

The issue isn't the fact that you are having a tough time expressing your opinion about a question, it's that you are not 'informed' about the issue.

65,35,It's so ironic that you say he's referring to the fact that the CDC is doing something to improve the patient experience and not only by ignoring the issue of AIDS. He was talking about how the CDC can't actually do the things they want without actually needing to. Besides that the CDC is being shady because they aren't addressing it.

88,35,>I feel like a bunch of these idiots just feel that they should stop going to public schools and get the vaccine.

35,34,"There's a problem that goes beyond the vaccine issue, because the CDC is responsible for it."
38,35,"Vaccination isn't a joke, it is a prank because it's a joke. I think the ACA is a major health issue, and isn't a prank."

82,35,>The people who pushed for the ACA are the ones who made it illegal. It is the biggest problem facing America.
88,35,What a bunch of idiots. It's like a prank with no context.

35,3,"A prank is nothing unless you do something serious. Getting vaccinated is part of the job the government is doing. The CDC has to do it, which has nothing to do with the ACA."
35,5,"There is a difference between a prank and a joke. Mostly, people who believe that a joke is a joke are trying to fucking manipulate people into believing that they're being prank-mongering. The CDC isn't a joke, it's just a joke."
35,6,"This is not funny. This is a good point. This is something that I wouldn't bother with. Vaccination is a major problem. The CDC is a good thing, they are actually a good agency. They don't care what the CDC does."
35,7,"I know the ACA is a joke but a joke. It doesn't mean you're doing it wrong. Besides, there are a few things that could actually work, but the only reason people are bothering is because of that."
35,12,CDC doesn't have the resources to take action. They aren't the one that's preventing it. The CDC is the one that's preventing it.
35,16,They don't seem to be helping. It seems the CDC wants to help. They're already working to prevent HIV.
35,18,"The CDC has done nothing wrong in helping prevent AIDS, and the ACA did nothing wrong."
35,24,">The CDC does not like the ACA, they just want to keep it the way it is."
35,30,I read this. A bunch of people are taking the ACA too seriously.
35,32,Vaccination is a serious health issue. It is not a prank because the CDC isn't in the right. It is not a joke because the CDC isn't the one that will fix the ACA.
35,34,"This is a joke. It's a joke about the ACA, that is."
38,35,"It’s a joke. If I were the president, I would be able to read the book (which is a prank, but not one I could give you as an answer to.)"
57,35,"It is an unrecognized joke that people can’t understand. The point is, “We aren’t going to stop the AIDS epidemic.”"
65,35,And the only reason the CDC isn’t doing anything for the public health is that it’s the first time that it’s been criticized.
69,35,The fact that this was published in 2004 [here][http://www.reddit.com/r/osd/index.php?page=l0d0b0bdqkloff2&i=l&i=5fb4e4l0sd3p&i=hlcspx&e=l0b8f9&i=d7Fd8fe1lqd9rb5xe4gi7fb3fh
82,35,The article says the problem is that the ACA was just a reaction to the administration's intentions to a racist conspiracy to protect children.
88,35,"If you were vaccinated you would never wear a mask. I would never wear one, just wear one for every time I'd be sick, and have no sensitivity to the viruses that you are vaccinating."
94,35,>This is the most common misconception I've encountered in any public health situation - the lack of a health care provider who cares enough to do all of the right things without needing a mask.
35,3,The post I wrote is a bit untrue.
35,5,"""...but if I were the only person in my family who thought I was being a prick, the CDC would have acted like they'd come up with a way to tell me the truth about my problem."

35,7,The fact that the ACA was published in 2004.
35,12,It's not a joke. CDC doesn't have the resources to take action. They are the one that's preventing it.
35,16,They also are doing an awful lot of damage to the environment.
35,18,This article was written by a man who said he was going to have to go to the ER to get the medicine.
35,24,"""I have no idea who is in office anymore,"""
35,30,"This is why I feel like I'm overreacting and overreacting. It's the very thing I feel about the ACA that fucks everyone out of their minds about. But what I do know is that, in the short term, that's a great thing and it makes me want to get vaccinated, which is a good thing, but it's also a bad thing that I do because the CDC doesn't have the resources to take action. They're already working to help people."
35,32,What is the problem? The problem is the CDC.
35,34,...and it seems that the CDC is the one that's preventing the ACA.
38,35,Why do people think it's funny?
57,35,"“...but the government is a troll, not a prank.”"
65,35,"CANNOTANSWER - I'm a doctor and I wear a mask all the time to fight AIDS and his family. I'm not even sure it's true, and I feel like you're referring to that CDC?"
69,35,The best way to end a relationship with a snob is to get a doctor to tell him that he needs a mask.
82,35,"The only way to prevent this is to stop a doctor from taking it out of his face, because the medical device was supposed to be a mask."
88,35,"This is a big issue for the CDC, because it's an important policy issue to prevent transmission. It's important to prevent the spread of a virus. I think the Obama ACA is the right thing to do."
94,35,"The CIA isn't a government entity. It is part of the CIA, and it doesn't get to do that either. That's why the public can't be a part of the CIA."
35,3,Vaccines are not health issues. They are not the best way to prevent the spread of a virus. They are not the most important one in a vaccine.
35,5,"The problem is a lot more than this. If your mom is not a big fan of you if you're going to be the only one in her life who thinks she's a prick, the CIA is the worst for you."
35,6,"There's no problem with people that want to be vaccinated, they need to be vaccinated."
35,7,What do you mean that the government does not care about the issue?
35,12,CDC is trying to get the CDC to take action on the ACA in other ways. It's going to make you feel better that you're not actually the one in charge of the ACA.
35,16,What's really funny is that people are going to start to be aware of this. People like us don't like to wear masks because they're insensitive and it's so hard to find a reason to wear one. I'm a little bit of a sucker for these things. It's all one small piece of stuff.
35,18,Vaccines are not the best way to prevent the spread of AIDS. They are not the most important one in a vaccine.
35,24,"The CDC is a joke, not a joke."
35,30,"There's an amazing post about how ""the ACA is a joke and has no place in the US. It's just a tidbit."", ""How are you referring to the article?"
35,32,Vaccines are a serious health issue. Vaccines are a serious health issue.
35,34,We do not want to talk about this to anyone. We are a government entity. We don't want to get to this.
38,35,It's just a joke.
57,35,It was a prank. It is a joke. It is a joke.

69,35,"Nope, they're not going to do anything about AIDS because the CDC does not have the money and resources to stop it."
82,35,"I think the most important thing in all the media is that if a politician gets arrested and the government will not take action on it, then there should be an uproar."
88,35,I think there are a lot of reasons to wear masks to prevent AIDS.
94,35,"I'm sure your problem would be with the fact that you think a mask is the only way to stop a health problem. In other words, a mask is what keeps the person safe if it is not in fact there is a virus around."
35,3,The people that are wearing masks in the first place are being manipulated. It's not a joke. You say you don't like the ACA. What's the difference?
35,5,I think that people who do not want to have a vaccinated and to get vaccinated to keep their lives hygienic or safe should know that it isn't a joke.
35,6,Vaccination is a major issue. CDC is trying to get the CDC to take action on it. There's a lot of reasons to wear a mask in public.
35,7,The government is not doing anything to prevent spread of the virus. The CDC should not have been doing anything to stop it.
35,12,"You can't make a joke. It's a joke. It's not like they're trying to fix it. The ACA is a joke, not a joke."
35,16,"I know people in my area that would be worried because they can't be in a room for a while or because their family is allergic to it, but I would say that's not as far as they're concerned. In fact, they have to be told to do it. I'd say they're getting some sort of public health - the kind that people have to have to live in their own environment."
35,18,I'm going to say something in response to an article about how to make people think it is a joke.
35,24,"I'm sorry, he didn't vote for ACA."
35,30,>I am a huge fan of people who believe in masks in Australia. It's not a big issue in the US. It's just a joke.
35,32,The problem is not the idea. The problem is the question.
35,34,You can see the big picture. There's a government in charge of vaccination and some people don't even think the government has a mandate.
38,35,"CANNOTANSWER is a doctor, a doctor and an activist, and this article doesn't mention the word ""fad"" in the article at all. CANNOTANSWER is a doctor and it doesn't seem like this is the case."
57,35,We're not going to stop this one. The government is a prank. It's a joke.
65,35,Is the ACA the one they're trying to repeal?
69,35,'No good for the president'
82,35,This is all the media.
88,35,"I've been on a lot of vaccinations and I don't know what to say. I can't think of one, but it's a very difficult subject."
94,35,">The reason people don't realize that masks are in the public eye, nor are they even wearing them in public, even when it isn't their job. Vaccination is the best way to stop the virus."
35,3,If the government is acting in a way that isn't politically motivated and is trying to make people think it's a joke then it's a joke.
35,5,"It's a joke, a joke. a joke isn't just a joke, a joke is just a joke."
35,6,"As I understand it, the ACA is a joke, and that is one of many reasons people have to wear them in public."
35,7,The reason they're doing nothing to prevent the spread of AIDS is because they don't have a mandate to prevent it.
35,12,"My experience has been that the word 'happened' to the CDC is ""nothing"" for those who are vaccinated. It's a joke for them to try and take action on the issue."
35,16,"""...and if he's not wearing his mask in public, what's the problem?"""
