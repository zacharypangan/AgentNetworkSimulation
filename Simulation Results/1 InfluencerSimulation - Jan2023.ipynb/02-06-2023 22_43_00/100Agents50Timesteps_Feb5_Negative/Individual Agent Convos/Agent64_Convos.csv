64,3,"I believe the reversible disease rebunks as much as the medical mask - because I don't even know what it means. There are many forms of reversible illness that you might encounter with the vaccine or other drugs you might have to use that might not be possible with a medical mask, and if you've been in the hospital for some time then that's it. You might also need to get tested and the government will be there to help you."
64,4,Are there other ways to prevent the spread of the virus?
64,5,"They're not just banning it in the U.S. unless it is the only place to go. If it is on the street, people will probably be getting all kinds of mucus on them and it can go from there if it's a flu."
64,28,I m with you. The government is inventing ways to stop a virus from spreading to everyone.
64,32,"I was at a theater when a friend of mine took him to the hospital and said, ""Hey, do you like wearing masks on my hands and putting them on?"" He put on a mask and walked through a room a few feet later and woke up to the sound of his eyes on the TV. I just sat down."

85,64,"""We are taking steps to stop the spread of a virus. We should bring the mask and the vaccine to the states in order to combat it."

90,64,"You've mentioned the issue of wearing a mask. That's an issue that has been egged out for decades. This is not a government issue, it's a government issue. That's why the government is in the middle of a campaign to stop it. They are just saying, ""you know, they are doing this to stop the spread of a virus."""
93,64,I've got a good idea for this to have been discussed on wikileaks. They're talking about a LOT of different ACA laws that would be enacted by congress.

85,64,If you were to come to Georgia to get vaccinated you should be wearing a mask! What is the difference? If the president was doing this then the president would be putting on the mask and you would have to veto it.
89,64,"I remember reading a comic about a guy who said he thought it was a joke. He put on a mask and then took off when he got to the table, and it was a nice time to get home and shave it off and do something about that joke and go do that to someone else."

89,64,I can't believe a person is going through a restaraunt and a person is walking in there.
90,64,I don't think the people who mentioned it in the movie are just saying:
93,64,The ACA is the biggest political challenge in history and is the biggest failure in the last 30 years. The people who pushed for it are the ones that made it illegal.

64,4,So... a reversible disease and a medical mask?
64,5,Is the government aware of the problem and it will work? And the problem is it's working.
64,28,I'm a lawyer so I think I might as well get a medical doctor to check for that virus if I am not in the US.

85,64,Obama administration? That's not what I mean. I'm talking about the ACA as it's an ACA backed policy in the middle east.

64,2,In the US you don't have to be vaccinated to stop HIV/AIDS. That's a problem.
64,3,"You said in the article that your dad is against these policies, not that the President doesn't have a say in it."
64,4,I would say this is one of the few logical responses to this.
64,5,"If I'm being a lawyer, then yes I want to do that."
64,28,"I think the story is pretty funny. I'm not sure it's funny but it is the only thing that I've ever heard in my life about the government's inventing ways to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS. My mother once had an allergy to HIV and in her experience, the doctor tried to tell her to go get vaccinated for it."
64,32,"I am very sorry, but I feel like this meme is on the front page, which I am not, and I feel like this meme is just another piece of shit."
64,47,"Vaccination is the best way to prevent illness. That means taking a sick pill and getting an anti-HIV vaccine. So, for example, it would be a good idea to take a picture of your own skin if you've got it - the mask is a way to prevent infection."
64,50,"You gotta pay for the mask, right?"
64,51,I thought there was an ACA issue.
64,52,I'm a lawyer and the first sentence is what I heard in a previous sentence:
81,64,"This makes me think of a lot of other people who have been exposed to HIV. I mean, why would I want to see a doctor who isn't wearing a mask?..."
84,64,...and a restraining order...
85,64,"It's the President, not the government, who's pushing this, the Obama Administration, and the Republicans."
89,64,I am sure that the movie would be fun. But I also wouldn't want to be the one who told the whole story.
90,64,I think that’s a good response.
93,64,This is a tidbit of facts. I'm not really sure if you're a tyrant or not.

64,4,"So, I'm guessing that the doctor that tried to tell her to go get a vaccination tries to convince her that there is no reason to get a vaccine? ''If there is a chance he can get that? ''"
64,5,I think your dad is being a bit over the top but this is the best thing that can happen.
64,28,"In other news, there are a lot of unvaccinated people."
64,32,"Well, a new meme with the name ""Mask a Man"" is coming out."
64,47,My father's post was one of the most interesting and important things I've heard about the President and I are so sad that he hasn't told me to stop wearing a mask.
64,50,"We are a nation. Vaccination is the best way to stop illness. That means taking a sick pill and getting an anti-HIV vaccine. So, for example, it would be a good idea to take a picture of your own skin if you've got it - the mask is a way to prevent infection. You gotta pay for the mask, right?"
64,51,The ACA has been fought for and the people who have been infected with the virus want to get vaccinated. The law says that they don't have to pay for the mask and the CDC wants to ban it. So they're saying there's no reason to deny the protections that will be taken out of the program.
64,52,"You mean ""here are some examples of ways that people can get vaccinated that aren't reversible""?"
81,64,I think I would like to add the other two things that make this post more interesting:
84,64,The only thing that can be done about it is to put it on. I believe that the best way to stop the virus is to make sure that someone in your life is safe while wearing the mask.
85,64,"In the ACA movie, we are talking about the ACA is a really bad idea. The only way that it makes us a bit ill, is to make it so we are not able to get it done."
89,64,"I think the movie is one of the best movies of all time. The sarcastic part of the article is that while people use a mask to stop the spread of a virus, it's not a joke. People wear masks to stop people from being able to walk like that if it is a joke."
90,64,"I just like to laugh at the word ""advice"". This is not a good movie, but it sounds like it's pretty good, as a person who can see what's going on. But it's not a good book or a good film, and I feel as if it could be a good one. It's not about the virus itself, but that doesn't sound like a good answer, but it sounds like the gist of the joke."
93,64,"The US has a terrible economy with a very expensive medical system. The US has an epidemic of AIDS. It has no cure, no cure. It has no cure. It's not like the economy is just not working, not that it's helping the American people. It's not the people that are responsible for it."
101,64,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
64,2,"'In the US, you don't have to be vaccinated to stop HIV/AIDS. That's a problem. That's a problem."
64,3,"The doctor, who's a lawyer, is wrong about the ACA. He should be able to figure out what the ACA means."
64,4,It's not a good movie. It's not a good movie. It's a good film.
64,5,'My mom isn't a lawyer'
64,28,No. But I think it's a good movie. It makes you feel like you're being a bit over the top. Probably doesn't make you a bit of a tyrant.
64,32,People are not doing the right thing. We are the people that will be responsible for the problem. We are the people who will be responsible for the problem.
64,47,"""The only thing that can be done about it is to put it on."""
64,50,The article was also written by a lawyer who is currently in the middle of doing the CIA investigation. It was sarcastic.
64,51,CANNOTANSWER: My father's post was one of the most interesting and important things I've heard about the President and I'm so sad that he hasn't told me to stop wearing a mask.
64,52,"I am not a lawyer, I am a lawyer. I can tell you that, but when it comes to that, I am in fact a lawyer."
81,64,"The fact that a lot of these people are wearing masks, especially since they don't have medical insurance, is absolutely irrelevant. It sounds like they are able to make a good deal of money in a way that isn't harmful to their health or well being. There is a lot of research that suggests that it is not.

84,64,I have a job as a health care worker.
85,64,I had this article on r/hhs where he was trying to talk about the ACA and they used a lot of that.
89,64,[I thought that's a bad joke.
90,64,I see the difference between the two films.
93,64,The ACA is going to be a very expensive medical system. There is no cure for the AIDS epidemic.
101,64,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
64,2,"'I was there when I went to go to a lecture and they're pointing out the problems with the lack of communication among the public.

64,32,CANNOTANSWER:
64,47,I have to say I think your father's post is really really important and I think that you should watch it because this is one of the best articles I've seen.
64,50,"The fact that a lot of these people are wearing masks, especially since they don't have medical insurance, is absolutely irrelevant. It sounds like they are able to make a good deal of money in a way that isn't harmful to their health or well being. There is a lot of research that suggests that it is not. There is no evidence that any medical doctor would be able to prevent it. I see the difference between the two films. The ACA is going to be a very expensive medical system."
64,51,I'm really confused and unsure.
64,52,So we are talking about the American people... the problem isn't with the ACA. You don't know anything about what the ACA means. You might be able to figure it out with a bit of research.
81,64,I believe that wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
84,64,You're the President of a world.
85,64,"I'm just sorry. It's not my business to be wrong. Vaccination is a great idea, but it's not what it was meant to be. Is it okay for the president to wear a mask?"
89,64,"I don't really get why people would put on a mask, and I think it's a dick joke that's just not sarcastic, but a joke."
90,64,"""I'm sick of talking to my friends and family about how a mask is helping them get the virus."
93,64,"What I like to hear here is that the Obama administration did not pass the ACA without the consent of a doctor, the people who pushed for it and the President who did not have the consent of a doctor were the ones that passed the ACA."
101,64,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
64,2,That's a joke.
64,3,I would be a very very good friend of the ACA. I want to wear a mask. I am not a cynic and I know what the ACA is. I can't afford to be vaccinated.
64,4,"So the word ""vaccine"" is just a generic reference to the'sick joke' the president is making about his daughter being sick."
64,5,"The ""Means"" are for a new medical issue. It's a non-responsible way to say something, and this isn't a medical issue anymore. The US has been able to handle all this problem for decades, not to mention the entire world. The issue is that they don't have any ideas about how they should proceed with the vaccine, because it does not seem to be the right answer, and they're making it hard to make it work."
64,28,"The whole thing has become so incredibly irrelevant. A lot of people, especially those with little to no medical credentials, seem to be drooling over the ACA, but I'm really confused about it."
64,32,What's the best part? Are you the one that doesn't like this?
64,47,"I don't know what to say, but I drew the line between a person who had to wear a mask and the person who didn't, and how a person who can't have a problem wearing a mask and just being a dick with a faked smile is an idiot."
64,50,I've heard all of these and the ACA doesn't really affect the health of a person.
64,51,"I think the ACA is a good idea, but it doesn't help it keep an epidemic going. It doesn't solve the problem itself. The ACA is a disaster. The US government has a weakened defense mechanism against a virus."
64,52,The problem is not the ACA. The problem is that the government is unable to communicate effectively. It's what the government is supposed to do.
81,64,There is a book about it and it does explain why a lot of people are not going to buy a mask. The movie doesn't even seem to mention it.
84,64,I am the president of the world.
85,64,"It is one thing that is so incredibly frustrating, and even more difficult to remove from the face of your face that it is really just a red flag."
89,64,"I read the wiki and saw the article. I was very captivated by the sarcastic joke that people were able to walk without a mask. I have no idea why but if I'm reading the book, I'll probably just say that ""the movie is one of the best movies of all time."""

64,2,"It's a joke. I don't really know what to say, I'm a cynic, but I like the ACA."
64,3,The biggest thing is that the government needs to educate people and educate them on the best ways to prevent it.

64,32,"This is an interesting issue that is the same as the ACA. What's funny about it is that it's being put on the front page on the front page by the NSA. If the ACA didn't pass, then they are trying to be more akin to the ACA."
64,47,The problem is that the government is unable to communicate effectively. It's what the government is supposed to do.
64,50,You are a very smart person. But I don't really believe they're going to change this. They just don't see the world.
64,51,Is this a good thing or a bad thing? The ACA has a bad name for the person that has the HIV.
64,52,I don't know if the guy who was not involved in the ACA was even in a movie about the ACA. That's not an actual problem.
81,64,That is what the US government is doing.
84,64,Then you'll find a snob on the White House.
85,64,"You said it, but I don't know what a vaccinated person is in Georgia. And I want to say that that vaccinated person is being misogynistic."
89,64,"""The problem with a mask is the people wearing it don't actually know how to walk because they think it's bad."""
90,64,What did that movie call for?
93,64,It is actually a really big issue that the government needs to be fighting for.
101,64,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
64,2,>We don't have to be vaccinated to stop HIV/AIDS. That's a problem. That's a problem.
64,3,">I don't want a mask on someone who has HIV. I want a mask on someone who has HIV, that's what I want a mask on."

64,50,"There's a book about the ACA that goes into detail in great detail, so I can understand why people are unsure about it but that's the one I agree with. The ACA has been discussed a lot by a lot of people and has a very interesting side effect, but I don't know the exact reason for the movie."
64,51,Are you aware that people in a particular region have been diagnosed with HIV?
64,52,I am a lawyer and the virus is a reversible disease that is not able to be detected by viruses.
81,64,"The NSA and CDC are not helping people who have been exposed to HIV/AIDS. The CDC is supporting the American government. They are funding the CDC and CDC. There are other options including the CDC, but I don't see how that works. It's not an option as many people feel that you don't have the right to speak out or be in public."
84,64,"You have been banned from the White House. I'd like to talk about it. You are saying that ""I don't see how a mask is going to stop a virus from spreading without a mask."" I would also like to point out that the guy is probably a bit of a snob because of the mask."
85,64,The ACA was a good idea. It's just that the President does not have the authority to enforce anti-virus laws. They are blatantly trying to say that in order to combat the spread of the virus he has to have a proper mask.
89,64,I read a book. It says that people wear masks to stop the spread of the virus.
90,64,i m not sure how much of the ad is going on in this movie.
93,64,"No, I'm not an 'opportunistic dictator'. This article has nothing to do with the president."
101,64,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
64,2,CANNOTANSWER:
64,3,I read the article and was confused to learn what it actually meant.
64,4,This meme has everything to do with the ACA.
64,5,"Nope, I am not the President."
64,28,It is a good movie. It makes you feel like you're being a bit over the top. It's an awesome thing to get a vaccinated and also have your own doctors check for it. This is the only way the government should help prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS.
64,32,"A lot of the comments are about the people who have the virus, so I'd consider this one of those"
64,47,"The first one is actually pretty much a joke. People who use it to get sick can get a rash, and the second one is a little harsh."
64,50,"You need to change your mask a little. I'm not a doctor and I'm not a doctor. I'm going to make sure that I am the only doctor who can prescribe something for me. Vaccination is not the way to go. There is no way for a doctor to be able to prescribe anything for me. I can't prescribe, but I can give some advice about it."
64,51,CANNOTANSWER: I'm not an opportunistic dictator. I'm not even an ad. I'm not a dictator.
64,52,Are you a lawyer? The best way to stop HIV and the disease is by being vaccinated.
81,64,The most interesting piece of info I can give you from this sub is:
84,64,"As the president, it is my understanding that coaches need to be in the position to be educated on what's going on. I don't think it's going to work. I think it will be a good reason for them to get rid of the mask."
85,64,This is a great way to get rid of HIV. It's a great way to make sure that there is no other harmful germs in the environment.
89,64,I just wanted to make sure someone is still talking about the joke I read and I'm in for a long discussion and you should be able to tell me why a lot of people do the same thing. I've read the whole thing before but I'm not sure that makes it a joke.
90,64,"I think you've really taken some good advice here, or I guess it's more that the book seems like an example of what the Obama administration is trying to stop."
93,64,"Is there an article somewhere saying ""Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.""?"
101,64,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
64,2,[NAME] ''The Obama Effect''': a joke
64,3,I have seen several people put on their masks but I don't think it's even the right thing to do. I think that the person who is telling it to the doctor is being a shady douchebag and trying to be a good person doesn't think it's a good idea.
64,4,Why is everyone wearing a mask? Why is that so hard to understand?
64,5,"There's a lot of talk about people wearing masks in general. I've read that the CDC and other research organizations are talking about getting the ACA passed, but I don't know how people are going to know if it's still possible."
64,28,This is one of those people.
64,32,I'm sure a lot of people are aware of the whole idea.
64,47,"I can't think of a more relevant one. I'd be willing to go read that and go find an article defending the government's anti-HIV vaccine and vaccinating, or I could read this on my own, but I'd be willing to have a very hefty handshake."
64,50,"You are not a lawyer, you are a lawyer. The truth is that this is a sarcastic meme and the President can't be a dictator. This is a joke and I think it's a good one."
64,51,I think that is why the ACA is so important. It's only a matter of time before the government does anything about it. I do not think we have a lot of time to fix this issue. The ACA is a disaster and it is the US government's fucked up way of helping to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS.
64,52,"As a doctor, I would say that I'd get a doctor for myself to try and find out what they're talking about."
81,64,I think the other three are pretty good. I'm a big fan of the ACA and it tries to bring down the people who aren't allowed to wear them if they feel uncomfortable. I read about it a few times in the movie that I read in my head.
84,64,I don't think the ACA really works. The US Military is trying to get a vaccine.
85,64,"Is the question of why not go get a vaccinated akin to ""Is that a better idea than the ACA?"" or ""Is it OK for the president to wear a mask?"" (no, I don't have a question) a satire?"
89,64,I read this article and I read a bunch of the other comments as well. It really surprised me that the only people who read it didn't have a hat.
90,64,They're just trying to make people think they have a problem with the government.
93,64,I just want to say that I think the Obama administration is trying to bring awareness to that issue as something that everyone knows is a huge conspiracy theory - I think it's time to put an end to this nonsense.
101,64,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
64,2,I don't understand why people are taking this as a joke. It's not the government and it's a joke.
64,3,"If I'm going to be the hat hat person in this movie, I don't think it's going to be that stupid."
64,4,As a lawyer I would say I would say this is one of the few logical responses to this.
64,5,We need to start doing this. We need to help people who aren't able to get their masks on. We need to help those who can't afford a mask.
64,28,I'm trying to figure out how to explain that I'm not a lawyer.
64,32,No. The ACA isn't a disaster. The Obama Administration is trying to make people think they have a problem with the government.
64,47,Isn't the ACA part of the US government's anti-HIV vaccine?
64,50,It's a good one.
64,51,You know what? The Obama Effect is the shit he has written about the US government. Why do you think that?
64,52,I think I'd say get a doctor for myself to try and find out what they're talking about.
81,64,This is not what Obama has come up with. We should do more to stop the problem from spreading.
84,64,"Yes, the ACA doesn't seem to actually work."
85,64,What's not to like?
89,64,You read that I think they're getting so many responses from readers on r/fsftm
90,64,"I feel like the author is very narcissistic, but i think he can tell a story about the people he thinks are trying to be nice to him.
