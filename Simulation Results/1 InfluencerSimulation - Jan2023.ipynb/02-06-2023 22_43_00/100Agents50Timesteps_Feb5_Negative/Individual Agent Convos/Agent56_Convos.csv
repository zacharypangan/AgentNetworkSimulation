84,56,"It’s very, very sad to read this. The best way to stop the spread of HIV is to be on a mask that helps someone breathe. And a hat. You would have to be very sick, sick, and you don’t know what it’s about? I'm sure there is a different meaning to what it means. The fact that this is on the national stage is very sad for many people."
89,56,I think a good part of it is that the government has to stop the spread of a virus.
93,56,Isn't it a big question that the people who wrote the article are not arguing that the president is a tyrant who wants to change the healthcare system?
56,1,Well the ACA doesn't apply to every citizen. People who don't use the ACA on the internet are also being dragged into a discussion about a lot of things. The ACA is a lot of other things that alot of people don't understand.
56,10,>I would have liked this to go on the wiki page to see a link to the article.
56,12,"> [I think the movie is one of the best movies of all time. It's a fact that you can't buy health insurance. The people in the video here have stated that they are against the ACA, not just the ACA. They are not making money off of it and they're not doing their jobs in the face of an AIDS epidemic and they're not a threat to health care. I'm interested in the fact that the president is giving the guy a mask. What's the point of the article?"
56,13,"if he were running it I think that is where he would get some sympathy, which isn't something that he would have to do for the sake of this shit."
56,18,I was in the middle of this debate a few days ago and I was really confused. Do you see any of the people in the video saying that the ACA is an evil ideology?
56,26,"Nope, it's a BS article. Unless you read it twice or less."
56,29,"Although he is a good doctor, it has to be a very good thing to do, he does have to do it, because his job is to get the best medicine for his disease and to stop a few other diseases.."
56,41,A clone of the CIA.

They are not making money off of it and they're not doing their jobs in the face of an AIDS epidemic and they're not a threat to health care."
56,51,People want the government to stop putting a mask on people and the government can prevent it from spreading. The ACA would be illegal if they aren't against it. They are only against the law they are attacking and that is ridiculous.

56,54,"You are the first person I've ever heard the term ""shady"" in the context of my own post."
63,56,No. The article was written with the intent to discredit the NSA for not doing the right thing.
75,56,This is the first time I've read a book devoted to the Obama administration. It's a very well titled movie.
77,56,The ACA is the solution to the AIDS epidemic. But what does it actually say about the ACA?
84,56,People who wear a mask to fight cancer aren't immune to it.
89,56,Is there anything you can do to help them? Because they know what they are doing and if you need a reason to say something you can't just just say it. Whether or not you want to say it is a good question for them.
93,56,It was actually just the other article addressing the ACA.
56,1,It's not so much a conspiracy or a political one. The ACA is a shit show.
56,10,">I was in the middle of this debate a few days ago and I was really confused. Do you see any of the people in the video saying that the ACA does not exist because it is an evil ideology? Nope, it's a BS article."
56,12,The article itself has been discredited by most of the commenters.
56,13,It was written with the intent to discredit the NSA for not doing the right thing.
56,18,"I like to think that they are trying to avoid the people who can't get vaccines as well as the people who can't get vaccines for AIDS. That's why they are not taking a seriously about it. Whether or not they don't care is irrelevant, but if they actually do, they might just be dragged into it."
56,26,"So the idea of the ACA being an evil ideology is a conspiracy theory, not a scientific one."
56,29,"""What are you trying to teach me about a terrorist"""
56,41,"I mean, this is a great movie, and yes i didn't say he was evil, but I don't think you've been read enough aol that you've heard the word ""Shady""."
56,46,"If they were actually talking about Obama, I would think that the article is about the president saying something like that (no matter how much it's true), because he's basically the man who wants to stop the spread of a virus."
56,51,I read the article to be sure he wasn't trying to justify the ACA.

56,54,"The story was written as a joke. But you're right, the author was trying to do the right thing. I would bet someone else that they are in the same boat as you."
63,56,"I don't think the president is an idiot, it's a prank. But the NSA doesn't seem to understand a lot of the people in the movie's story. It sounds like they figured out some pretty obvious stuff and said they wouldn't do it."
75,56,I don't understand how I don't want a doctor and doctors to have to get vaccinated for the virus.
77,56,"It's basically saying that the best way to prevent AIDS is to make it a thing and let people use the ACA as a tool, not an insurance policy."
84,56,This is where the real problem is:

56,18,I'm not a political politician.

56,41,[Richness News](https://www.reddit.com/raisedbyfwadol) says the ACA is a shit show. It's a prank.
56,46,"I think people should have all this information as evidence of who they are, not just someone who is not the president, and has no interest in defending the ACA. This is what I'm saying. It's a very good movie."
56,51,"This is why it is important to have more free, reasonable healthcare, not only to prevent future death. It's also about taking care of the elderly, preventing the need for care and treating them, and having them be part of the solution to the disease."
56,53,"The ACA is not an evil ideology. It is a nonsense. If the president had acted like that, he would have made it into the constitution."
56,54,"People are still thinking ""suddenly ill"" because it's a really, really bad idea to knowingly bring up the ACA, which was the CIA's way of trying to make a joke out of it, but the actual idea hasn't been explained."
63,56,The first and last sentence of the article is probably just one of those stupid fucking things about the government.
75,56,"I don't understand how people want to see that they have to be vaccinated against AIDS, since it makes them sick, but they want to prevent it. I understand that doctors have to work harder to protect the poor than they need to, but there are so many things they have to do, especially the one they don't want to vaccinate because a vaccine is useless."
77,56,Vaccines are the best way to prevent the spread of a virus. But the article says that the antisemitic act (ACA) is an antisemitic act. It's a prank and a joke. The government is trying to be a snide guy.
84,56,I have a feeling he is just a little bit too scared to ask if the president is putting the mask on or not.
89,56,It's not a joke. It's a joke.
93,56,"IANAL, but I'dn't think it's right that the article states the president is an opportunistic dictator vs. an opportunistic dictator because the administration was trying to stop the spread of AIDS vs. the government."
56,1,"Well, to be fair, it's not very good. It's not like the ACA was a conspiracy because of some very simple reasons."
56,10,I have to be very specific here. You are speaking of a huuuuge conspiracy. You are arguing that the ACA is a BS story and is a prank.
56,12,A presidential campaign was a failure.

It's funny how he reacted to it, but the author felt a bit guilty."

56,26,"So what is the point of not caring if you are a dick or not, when you are a dick?"

56,53,I'm very much into this topic and I'm more into the ACA because of the fact that the government is supposedly trying to prevent the spread of AIDS.
56,54,It's too late for me to get up and do some shopping.

89,56,Why do you wear a mask if you can't actually walk? It's just a joke. And that's a big reason to wear a hat.

56,18,"So, basically, the guy who went to the hospital and gave the guy a mask – with him on – and that he was actually vaccinated?"
56,26,That's a joke. The only part of it I find to be funny is that you are quoting a prank.
56,29,It's called a joke. I can't believe it. You've been here for five hours.
56,41,"This is a topic i can relate to. I would ask if he wanted to go on about this topic or about a similar issue. I would like to know the difference between ""the ACA is a prank"" and ""the ACA was a prank"".

56,12,Then you can have a talk about the ACA.
56,13,What do you think of the ACA?
56,18,The only reason they a prank would make people not aware of the virus is if the government had a mandate to not put on a mask.
56,26,"Well, there’s a repercussion for the ACA repeal but they’re not really antisemitic."

56,54,I see the hive mind as a very powerful force in government.
63,56,I think this is a little unfair.
75,56,They need to get rid of this by a law that carries a mandate. The law carries a mandate requiring people to wear a mask to prevent infection. And a mandate requiring people to be covered with a mask is a monopoly that the government is a party to.
77,56,That is a prank. But the Obama administration is acting out of pity.

56,12,"The president was talking about the ACA. The ACA was a prank that the other person was trying to use to make a joke, and it was a prank on him to use it to get a lot of attention. That's one of the things that's so important to the American public that people are always surprised and genuinely interested in it. Until a CDC member in the white house decided to put some nonsense in the hat, the government would be very likely to see it as a joke."
56,13,A little bit of humor. So what does the CDC say?
56,18,"IANAL, but I'm not a political party and I'm an anti-vaccine protester."
56,26,"The article was actually based on the fact that he was trying to get the CDC to repeal the ACA. And he was not arguing that the ACA should be repealed, which is a good thing."
56,29,"In the US, people wear masks to help prevent the spread of a virus. I think it's a joke."
56,41,"I'm trying to write a new article about this. I've heard it all, but only to find out that I'm wrong. I'm a very conservative person, and I'm not sure why I can't understand the story - I know it's a lot of snarky, but I'm not getting anything out of it. I do get snarky jokes, but the whole idea of an article that is so misleading is really annoying."
56,46,I don't want to listen to this guy....
56,51,>I’m the guy that thinks he’s a dick and a sneeze and a jab.
56,53,So how is the article spelled in the name of the president?
56,54,>A lot of people are being stoked at the president's effort to prank others into thinking he's a prank because he is a prick.
63,56,>...[[[En.wikipedia.org/wiki/RENT_Of_Measurements] is a website for people who wear a mask every time someone else wants to wear a mask.

Vaccines are an important and effective tool for preventing the spread of AIDS. Vaccines are an important and effective tool for preventing the spread of AIDS.
77,56,I think the article is going to be very long.
84,56,The president is making a joke about the CDC and the vaccine. Using that as a prank is just a prank.
89,56,"""Putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i have done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask."""

56,1,CANNOTANSWER:
56,10,"""...I think this is pretty much the biggest problem in my country."
56,12,The article is misleading and misleading.
56,13,>It seems that the Federal government has done some work for them in this country.
56,18,>The article is on a website that doesn't quote anything from the CDC. It's a hivemind that isn't much if anything compared to the article. There are literally dozens of people who are outraged at this. The president was talking about the ACA.
56,26,Afraid that this is just a prank.
56,29,"I don't like the rape, but I want my mask on, because I don't think I can. I don't want a face in a hat that says anything about me or who I'm at all comfortable with."
56,41,"[[CNN](https://www.reddit.com/r/Americas_not_a_Reddit) is a weekly non-partisan resource presenting a series of articles about ""doctors and the cdc, AIDS and their health care policies"")"
56,46,">The whole premise of the article is that the president is making a joke about the ACA. ""Putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i have done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask."""
56,51,"I think the main point is that the person making the joke has been attempting to take advantage of the ACA to make it a joke, and as a result, he's been mislead into believing he was making a joke on the ACA. This is all the jokes that come to mind."
56,53,"As far as I can tell, there's no prank or prank claiming on the article, and they're pretty much just pranks. So they're not pranks. They're pranks. If Obama had had acted like that, he would have made it into the constitution."
56,54,This is the hivemind of this story.
63,56,"I agree. I don't understand the meaning of this. The fact that it's just one sentence tells me it's more of a joke than a prank, so I think that's what the article is about."
75,56,"Assuming the government has the funding to do its job and wants to help people in their community, I'm pretty sure that the first step in the fight against AIDS is to put in place some sort of legislation that requires people to wear a mask to avoid infection. So they don't have to do it if you don't want to."
77,56,>It's pretty easy to get an AIDS virus but that does not make it an issue.
84,56,It seems a little ridiculous to me that people will make excuses to prank on the president for not doing anything that does nothing for the AIDS epidemic unless they have a specific reason for doing it. Vaccination does not stop the spread of the virus. Vaccination does not stop the spread of the virus. It is an important way to stop the spread of the virus. It is an important way to prevent the spread of AIDS. The president needs to be forced to take up a new job. This isn't a prank.
89,56,"OP doesn't know what it is. A prank is a prank because it makes people laugh. A prank is a prank because it makes people laugh, and a prank because it makes people laugh, and a prank because it makes people laugh. It's a prank because it pisses people off."
93,56,I think he is probably trying to push the issue further.
56,1,The point of this story is:
56,10,"The ACA is a joke and a prank. The ACA is a joke. If the President didn't go to a doctor and ask him to have an exam and the restraining order, he wouldn't be able to help the AIDS epidemic."
56,12,It is a joke about the ACA that has been repealed by the US government.
56,13,What are the major issues with this article.
56,18,What is the point of a prank? The ACA is only a joke because of the fact that it's a joke.
56,26,", ""'I've done a lot of dumb things in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask"""
56,29,The whole situation is a prank and the article is a prank.
56,41,I like this article because I can understand why the ACA was a prank.
56,46,"""I'm an American with an ACA (Civil Immunization Act) and I am extremely concerned about the safety of my family and I need to learn to be an advocate. It is very skewed, and it does not apply to this country."
56,51,I think the question is what kind of prank is going to be made in a workplace?
56,53,"I mean, I just think it's just a prank."
56,54,"The article demonstrates the complexities of the ACA as well as what it is, as a whole."
63,56,What was the problem with the movie? I was just wondering whether the CDC figured out why there was no CDC in the movie.
75,56,"So, who is that guy who says that I'm against the government?"
77,56,>I do not know if it's a joke or a joke.
84,56,Yes. But this is why the CDC has banned the use of masks in the vaccine program.
89,56,"I think this is funny and funny, but that's not what I'm saying."
93,56,"CANNOTANSWER: I’m afraid there is a problem, not only with the ACA, but also with the lack of a common courtesy."

56,12,"He can't get a lot of attention from people who do'make fun' of the ACA and say ""yes, they have done their work in helping the AIDS epidemic. ''"
56,13,You could write about how the CDC is not willing to compromise in the future and then use it to hive the story or pranks you have made.
56,18,"People are being forced into an extreme stance on this one. I'm not even sure what it's about, but I'd be very hesitant to watch the video just to make it feel real."

56,51,I'd get up early for work to get a helmet and get a hat and a jacket. It's a good idea.
56,53,The article explains that it has to do with this problem and that this is what it is.
56,54,"He's not just a joke, he's an idiot."
63,56,CANNOTANSWER is a racist and a sexist and hateful Democrat. They're using it as a pawn in an attempt to make the govt look fucked up.
75,56,"As someone who has lived in the United States for a long time, I'm interested in learning about CDC, especially their 'Scrollin'. I've seen the CDC a few times and even there's a film called the Hitchcock Show. I've read the CDC's video series, and I still find a lot of the CDC and CDC's movies a bit more interesting."
77,56,What a prank.
84,56,"I thought it was a joke, but I don't think the president has the right to a prank for not doing something. Vaccination is a great idea but it's not what it was meant to be. The CDC isn't going to stop the spread of the virus, they are going to do something to prevent it. Vaccination is not a prank, it is an important way to prevent it, and it isn't an ongoing fight.

56,10,There's not much left to go on here. This is how you feel about an organization. What you feel about a group of people is something that everyone has to be aware of.

56,26,Isn't 'A hivemind a powerhouse?' What is it about it?
56,29,"I feel so slighted. But hey, I'm a guy so I have to get the axe off me."
56,41,"No, a sex narcotics mask."
56,46,"This is where they get confused if you like to see it. I read it in their voice and thought it was a joke. So, you say that this is a good read. You're a little confused. Why are they being taken as a prank. But you're wrong? 'Oh, yes he is a prankster''."
56,51,So you guys are being downvoted for the article?
56,53,"""The ACA does not exist because it is an evil ideology. If Obama hadn't acted like that, he would have made it into the constitution."""
56,54,The government has a job that is not a joke.

56,12,CANNOTANSWER: (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypta
56,13,I read this as a joke and wanted to get my point across.
56,18,"There are several issues with the ACA. They are, and should be, part of the current effort by the US, the USSR and the CDC to systematically and intentionally reduce the number of cases that have been detected. A number of those problems were raised in the past and are still going strong. So I'm going to go and read it. The ACA is still in the US and if you have an issue, I'd say that you're going to have a difficult time finding an ACA ad and don't want to be able to do it."
56,26,"This article makes the difference between a prank and a prank because the ACA is being repealed, and not because the ACA repeal is a good idea."
56,29,"It's a joke, if anything. It's like saying a man's girlfriend is a prick with an axe to it, or a man's girlfriend is an asshole to get the axe off of him. It's like saying that if a politician threw a gun at someone in a prank, and you're a prick, the same thing as a man who threw a knife at someone in a prank is an asshole to the government and not a joke"
56,41,The article states that Obama is not able to take action to get rid of the ACA.
56,46,It's not really about what the ACA is. It's just about what the president means by putting on a mask.
56,51,People like the ACA in a negative light.
56,53,This is a topic that I've often written and it's very interesting.
56,54,Because people want to see things that they don't.
63,56,"It's not the movie, it's the story, the joke isn't it?"
75,56,There is a lot of stuff about the ACA and it's a monopoly on government funding.
77,56,>Arnold says the ACA is the solution to the AIDS epidemic. Why is 'Vaccines are not a health issue'? It's a joke.
84,56,Vaccination is an important part of the president's agenda.
89,56,It seems like a prank is a joke because it makes people laugh. A prank is a joke because people laugh and people don't know how to walk. The hat is a joke because it makes people laugh and it's funny. It's a joke because it makes people laugh and people don't know how to walk. It's a prank because people wear hats because they want to do it for fun. A prank is a joke because it makes people laugh.

56,1,The ACA is a joke. It is just a joke. It isn't just a joke.
56,10,"the jokes are not real. the fact that a few people put on a mask and took it off is the joke that is being criticized by many. the issue of that person's mask is a matter of fact. the joke is about an unpopular opinion and a person's lack of respect for their rights, but is also a joke in and of itself, the joke itself is a joke. this article isn't about a prank, it's a joke about people like the ACA in a funny way. that's why, """
56,12,"""Well, the president is trying to get a lot of attention and not a joke. It's a joke."""
56,13,He is trying to get the ACA repealed. He will not be able to do it if it is repealed by him. This is a joke.
56,18,So a prank that makes people laugh is a prank?
56,26,This is a prank.
56,29,"In a nutshell, this is all the point he made."
56,41,I've been there. But I've had the worst time with it.

56,53,'I'm very much into this topic and I'm more into the ACA because of the fact that the government is supposedly trying to prevent the spread of AIDS.
56,54,The ACA is still a prank if we are going to repeal it. If he can't repeal it then there is a problem. He can't even repeal it because it is a joke.

93,56,"The Obamacare repeal is a good one, but it doesn't make the president a tyrant if he doesn't actually repeal it. It's a terrible idea. It's a failure to actually do so."
56,1,It's a joke because it's a joke.
56,10,The point is that a good part of this joke is that it can't be used as a way to stop the spread of a disease without some sort of meaningful health insurance.
56,12,[NAME] is an American who wears a hat and hats to prevent the spread of the AIDS. It seems like a prank because it makes people laugh.

56,18,This is a prank. The prank is a joke.
56,26,"It was really a good read for me. But I couldn't get my head around it because I was not a good comedian. So I found it funny, prank worthy, but it was a prank and I think it was a pretty good reread."
56,29,"i think it’s funny, and the guy can do something about it. He could easily be called an asshole if he wanted."
56,41,CANNOTANSWER: 'The ACA is a prank'.
56,46,"In a new chapter of his book, he says something about how he is using this phrase in the article and how he is pranking about putting on a mask, but also he is doing the whole thing in the title to give an insight."
56,51,The article was actually quite accurate. Apparently there is a lot of confusion here about the ACA and how it's a joke.
56,53,This is a really important ad for the book: the CDC is getting a bad review of Obamacare in the U.S.
56,54,"I think it's interesting how the article is going to end with the words ""I think it's funny"", ""I think it's funny"" and ""I don't understand why it's a joke""."
63,56,It's not a prank. It's just a joke.
75,56,You've got all the answers right there. The first point you need to take is: 'I'm not a prank'. You're not a prank.
77,56,I really don't understand what you mean. I've had to put up with a bunch of 'hobbies who weren't interested' things and some of them are actually very clever and clever and funny. I'm not the type to go to a medical school and do all that for myself. What's more I do like to think about them is that they get all these crazy shit from people that they've never heard about. They're doing all this for themselves. That's the joke. But you need to know.
84,56,"And then there is the CDC, which is the country with the highest polio ratings on the planet."
89,56,"A prank is a joke because it makes people laugh, and it's a joke because it makes people laugh."
93,56,"There is also a huge, ongoing discussion about whether or not there should be more support for a single plan in place."
56,1,So you say that in a prank.
56,10,"People here think that Obamacare is a joke. They are referring to the fact that it has not been repealed. The ACA doesn't have a mandate to cover everyone who wants a health insurance policy. Unless it was part of a restraining order that only covers people who need it, I don't see why it should matter if the government wants to cover all of us who don't have it."
56,12,"I don't get it. But if it was a joke, it would be a joke. Then I would rather have the hat, not the hat."
56,13,What did he do to get Obama to repeal the ACA? He was putting a joke together about the ACA.
56,18,I think there's a lot of confusion in the article about what the ACA is about.
56,26,This is the story of two people who took a joke to the CDC about Obamacare.
56,29,I thought I was a troll.

56,46,I'm very disappointed that these people are in the middle of getting sick and apathetic for their lack of health insurance.
56,51,"I've heard stories a while ago where someone was bringing the issue up for a movie, but didn't really know it was coming up. It was one of those cases where someone in his class was complaining about the ACA and hoped someone wouldn't be so offended. One day, they found out they had an issue with the ACA and made a joke about it. A lot of people don't even understand the details of the ACA. The ACA isn't a prank, but I think you know what it is."
56,53,"This is a very interesting and i've read it a few times in this sub, I really don't think it's a good idea. It's funny and I think it's a pretty good joke, but I don't think I've read the entire thing."

63,56,"As a long time CIA employee, I don't understand the issue."
75,56,"I believe it's a prank, and we're a big prankster!"
77,56,That's the whole point of having a man take care of his own family for free without a mask.
84,56,"I like the idea that ""Poor"" or ""Nasty"") could make a joke about what they are doing to prevent AIDS but only because it's a joke."

56,1,"The ACA was a joke, a joke because of the NSA, and a joke because of how cynical it was. But it's not a prank."
56,10,>(http://www.enhs.gov/resources/Nhs-Aca/) The article itself isn't about the ACA because of the potential danger of infection. The idea of a restraining order is not a repercussion for all public health coverage.
56,12,I've heard that a few times OP has told me that his comment about this is hilarious and sad. The other one also says the hat is not a joke. I've even heard that he thinks this is a prank. It is an unfounded question.
56,13,"I think it is a pretty good joke, because this story is pretty funny, but it does sound like a prank."
56,18,"The ACA is a joke, a joke."
56,26,It is a joke. What is the point of getting the ACA repealed? Is there a good way to explain that it is not a joke?
56,29,The people here who are in the middle of getting sick and apathetic for their lack of health insurance.
56,41,I read the title and had to reread it. And it made me very happy when I read the story.
