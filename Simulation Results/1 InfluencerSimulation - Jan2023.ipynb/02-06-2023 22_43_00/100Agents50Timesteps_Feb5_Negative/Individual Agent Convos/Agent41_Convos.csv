90,41,yes the newest strain is soooooo contagious just bc they have a mask on their hands pics don t mean they re using it
41,3,Its like the government is making a lot of money out of a joke that has the intention of affecting people.
41,4,"It's a very, very big issue here, but what about the govt. mandates?"
41,6,"It seems like it was one of the most invasive vaccinations ever made and a major problem has been that people don't want to be forced to wear a mask to prevent a serious health concern because the disease spreads in the public domain. If they can't get their public health departments to change the law to change it, then the government needs to stop blaming it on the other side."
41,8,They are not a logical response to the idea of being able to choose whether you are wearing a mask or getting the jab. The mask is the only thing that is currently required to have a symptom.
41,11,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
41,15,> i cant get mad that an event doesn t have an mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops

65,41,What is the problem with a vaccinated person who is on the street or outside in public?
75,41,"You are the govt's president, isn't he?"
81,41,There isn t a rule where people need to wear a mask to work. It s a rule that is illegal in certain states. I don t know why you gotta wear a mask.
84,41,"The most important thing is that you don't wear your mask. If you wear a mask, you do not wear it."
85,41,"Uh, so much of it goes back to a bit of the past and the current system, and not just the last few years."
86,41,This will probably be the craziest thing to do if the president doesn't wear it properly.
90,41,"I don't think a single person has a right to be in a public space. The mask is for a reason, it's for someone."
41,3,So what is the question about the government and what is the problem with a vaccinated person in a public space?
41,4,Why doesn't the president wear a mask to protect themselves?
41,6,"""It seems like it was one of the most invasive vaccinations ever made and a major problem has been that people don't want to be forced to wear a mask to prevent a serious health concern because the disease spreads in the public domain."""
41,8,"And if the state decides to stop wearing a mask, then the government will still be the last nation on this planet in terms of a policing system."
41,11,I've been a politician for a few years now. I've had this happen and the only reason I have was the fear.
41,15,"It's been done. I threw a party bus around a lincoln field when I was in high school, and all the people I saw didn't have a job because I was vaccinated. It was a very funny incident."
41,16,"They have a lot of anti-vaccination policies that are incredibly hard to implement, and many of the policies they enforce are also actually very good, and they can take some seriously. A good reason to keep it off of the list is because they are all so heavily regulated. You can't say what people think they want in the government, but it's not good enough to change the rules."
41,17,I don't think any government would ever make the policy of wearing a mask the rule.
41,18,"We gotta go to the hospital to get tested for a virus. We need to see a doctor that's familiar with the virus, but we don't know when. I want to see how it passes though if my doctors tell me how to take it on a drug test."
41,23,I don't know why you think putting on a mask gives you the right to be in public.
41,29,I think a lot of people here have the opposite retort.
41,33,"As a Georgian who has never been vaccinated, I could go on my tour and see the entire state in the picture."
41,39,"People should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force. I have an irrational fear about these things. I would not wear a mask in public unless they want to protect themselves and everyone else is exposed to the virus. They would be a great way to protect yourself but if you don't want to, get the jab."
41,40,I feel like this has nothing to do with the policy at all but with the fact that they are not going to change any time soon.
42,41,"This is the most important part of the article, and it's the only one I can find that suggests this."
52,41,"OP, this is why we should re-name it''The Doctor''and 'The Doctor''. The Doctor wants the state to be the best state to teach his players and not give him the choice between the sexyness of a mask or a mask worn under a helmet."

59,41,"I didn't mean to suggest that you shouldn't. I was referring to the question of whether the government is really trying to prevent the spread of a virus, but rather to the question of why it doesn't make a sense to use it?"
65,41,"I don't understand you. The op was not talking about how the school did not like the mask public health order, but it was simply a question of what the school did, because they were on the ballot, and the health department wanted to do something about it."
75,41,Vaccines are a good way to keep your eyes open when you're vaccinated and you're not getting any ill effects unless you're fully vaccinated. They're better for your health than the govt's president.
81,41,"[You should be allowed to wear a mask in public. You are going to be sacked and have to leave georgia. I think people should be allowed to wear masks and not face any danger, just to keep those masks on. In some states, wearing a mask for work is a requirement.

86,41,I agree that this is the most ridiculous and dumb thing the whole United States has done. This is one of the dumbest things I have ever done.
90,41,"I think i'm going to go out of my way to say that I don't think a single person has a right to be in a public space. The mask is for a reason, it's for someone."
41,3,"I'm not a fucking moron, I can make my own laws."
41,4,"The article is completely accurate. You're a woman. It's a pretty fucking big issue, and if you want to learn about the history and laws surrounding the use of masks, you need to do the opposite."
41,6,"You are not correct. ""I think people should be allowed to wear a mask in public. You are going to be sacked and have to leave Georgia."""
41,8,"That's not very good. It's not a sexist thing, it's not an insult to a human being."
41,11,"I have no idea why anyone would put on a mask in public... I mean if they weren't supposed to be vaccinated, they would be sacked. They would be sacked as well."
41,15,The question is why does it need to be called 'the doctor'?
41,16,No one cares if someone is vaccinated.
41,17,I have a friend who was in Georgia and he got sick because he had a virus. He wanted to come home and get tested for it. He didn't think his mask would do anything.

41,40,Using a mask is a stupid policy. You aren't a doctor.
42,41,I'm going to throw this into the conversation as if this guy is joking.
52,41,"I’d suggest they get the first round pick of the ACA, as he has always said. ""Hey man, this is why we should re-name it’s ‘‘The Doctor '‘and ’’.

56,41,"Despite my own insistence that I have done things not to help those who are sick, and not being able to stand up for me (like you were), I still consider the act of removing a mask the ""scumbag"" thing."
59,41,"They say ""the problem with being vaccinated is that it's not the most effective way to stop the spread of the virus. I think it's not a good way to stop a clot from spreading to someone's body."""
65,41,This was a discussion I was having with the principal. When was it a red flag?
75,41,[Making a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Making a mask). Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
81,41,"i wear a mask when i am in public lawmaker who isn't wearing his mask in public says', 'There isn't a rule where people need to wear a mask to work. It s a rule that is illegal in certain states."
84,41,"You are saying that ""We'll resign and not coach until this nonsense stops. We'll resign and not coach until this nonsense stops. I am very sorry but you have to play with a coach, then he needs to be able to work on his own skills."
85,41,"Vaccinating your dog is a big deal. But, in all seriousness, if someone is exposing the human body to a virus then they should be doing the same thing, as the person describing it."
86,41,You could have a great excuse to be fired as a vice president.
90,41,That's exactly how we are. I'd say that a doctor or hospital is specifically authorized to prevent a virus. The ACA is mandated by law.... so now it has to stop working.
41,3,"I'm gonna go out and make this joke to make some good money and talk with the Governor. But then I'll start speaking to people from the state of Georgia, and I'll be sure to leave my mouth shut as I'm in Georgia. I won't want to impose a rule with the governor. I'll be sure to put a helmet on at the top of my head."
41,4,"The mask is a thing in most people's life. People who haven't seen it in public haven't been in a position to have a conversation about it, because they feel compelled to do so."
41,6,"I believe the problem is the “can’t get people fired” policy, which is a “what if” policy for people not being vaccinated."
41,8,"CANNOTANSWER: I'm not against them, but I want to do the same. What are the chances that they can be fired from the job?"

41,15,When did this incident happen? I'm in a state where you can't have the choice. There is a really good government that has put on a lot of masks. They're the best thing you could do to help a person. I think the fact that it's not a requirement to go to a doctor to get tested for a virus is a red flag.

41,18,I think I can help you out. What he said is very obtuse and reprehensible. It's not going to change as long as the ACA doesn't come into effect.
41,23,"So, the ""no one cares if someone is vaccinated."""
41,29,I have no idea why you are sarcastic. I feel like you are a moron and should make fun of yourself.
41,33,The ACA is mandated by law.
41,39,"Vaccination mandates don't address the problem - it addresses the problem that the vaccine is supposed to deal with. A vaccinated person - and thus the threat of vaccine - should be exempt. The ACA should be expanded to include the ""doctor"" and other measures."
41,40,"This is like the most obvious rule in the whole country, right?"
42,41,I don't care how they make it to that point.
52,41,"The new rules are what will not get a better response - I just got a second one to try and explain to you how it works. It's like saying someone else was trying to get a different perspective, and I can't help but think that this is funny enough to have an opinion."
56,41,"I had to remove one before I was able to take my health insurance back, as I was an asthmatic person. I didn't get to keep them off because they didn't have a proper mask or a proper mask. I got the ACA and then redid it because I thought it looked funny. So my CDC has it, but I don't know how I managed to get a full life insurance."
59,41,"What he's saying is... I don't think he can get vaccinated for HIV (because the government isn't going to fix it) but if it makes him sick, he can get vaccinated. It's only if he wants to go to the hospital and get it vaccinated. It's not like he has to wear it to protect himself and others. He can't, so it's just a way to say he can't."
65,41,The CDC is the only public health agency in the nation that provides protection for people who do not wear a mask. That means the state doesn't have to do anything about it.
75,41,I think you've misunderstood why this is the way it is.
81,41,"What you're doing is the only thing you've done to prevent the spread of a virus, you get no protection, and nobody cares."
84,41,I'd resign because I'm afraid it's not going to happen.
85,41,"So what is the main point of the article, what does it suggest, or is there something that you can do to change that?"
86,41,The article I was reading says that it was designed to keep people out of a fight.
90,41,"CANNOTANSWER: he has HIV that he hasn't gotten in a reversible disease yet. He has a mask on his hands, but no other mask."
41,3,"""Hey, you have a cough! You're a sick prankster!"""
41,4,This is a very serious issue. You are being sarcastic.
41,6,"I was reading a very similar article when I read that. I'm assuming that the article is actually referencing the 'Since the Act has been introduced in 2014 the public health department has issued orders for people to wear a mask in public."""
41,8,"""We gotta go to the hospital to get tested for a virus. We need to see a doctor that's familiar with the virus. We need to see a doctor that's familiar with the virus. We want to see how it passes though if my doctors tell me how to take it on a drug test."" ""Cannot think of a better answer, so I can't tell you."" ""Then if the state decides to stop wearing a mask, then the government will still be the last nation in terms of policing."""
41,11,">I think the fact that it's not a requirement to go to a doctor to get tested for a virus is a red flag. Vaccinating your dog is a big deal.

I've had this happen and the only reason I have was the fear."
41,15,"In this case, he is assuming that his doctors will be doing a better job if you are vaccinated, he is incorrect. He is also wrong that he is not eligible for the Medicaid program and has no reason to apply for it because of the ACA."
41,16,It’s not about vaccination – its about being able to go and get tested and then get tested and then get a full life insurance – there are no federal mandates for this. They were drafted to protect people from HIV and not revert to a reversible disease by the government.
41,17,"I know you are oblivious but as you've pointed out, the fact that you're a moron who would take a lot of heat from a snide joke that is basically what we're looking at is completely irrelevant to your point."
41,18,"""I have no idea why you think putting on a mask gives you the right to be in a public space. I think I can help you out. What he said is very obtuse and reprehensible. It's not going to change as long as the ACA doesn't come into effect."""
41,23,I would not be able to do anything to change the laws on this topic.
41,29,"Vaccination mandates aren't mandated by law. A person's health isn't based on whether they are in a vaccinated state, which is what the ACA does."
41,33,"> We gotta go to the hospital to get tested for a virus. We need to see a doctor that's familiar with the virus, but we don't know when. I want to see how it passes though if my doctors tell me how to take it on a drug test."
41,39,"So, a mask to prevent a spread of HIV isn't a medical requirement?"
41,40,"The idea of people putting on masks for protection is so wrong, they don't get a way to change it. They don't get a chance to be able to help people but you can have that freedom if it is appropriate. You could get fired and still work or go on a sabbatical. You can't do it at this point if you don't have a choice and don't want to be in a fight, that's just ridiculous. You have some rights in public, and that's what you have to do is being"

75,41,"A lot of people here are making it so that you can't claim that you need to wear a mask. I'm actually not saying that it is a good idea, but, I think we'll get some better policies by the end of this year. Having to buy masks is going to make people more concerned. But if you're not getting one, then you're gonna have a tough time."
81,41,They should not have the same mask in a room.
84,41,"IANAL, but not in this subreddit. I'd resign because I'm afraid it's not going to happen."
85,41,"I'm an anti-HIV nut, and you're the first to tell my govt to stop wearing a mask, just like their government."
86,41,"I'm not a doctor, but if you are doing a lot of mingling or looking at the internet, what is the difference between putting on a mask and doing a mask that's actually a mask and putting on a mask?"
90,41,"I don't think people can accept that the government doesn't want to help HIV. If anything, I don't think it's a good idea."
41,3,What's the first thing you'll do in Georgia?

People think it’s a great idea to get sick. You vaccinate the body when you can’t breathe properly, it’s really not as effective as it used to be. I don’t think it’s a good idea to want to be in public but I don’t see the problem with not having to wear a mask on your face. I don’t"

52,41,"This is one of the few places in the US where people don't know what this is, and they're just so hesitant to take action."
56,41,"Considering the ACA is a federal law, it's not really any big deal. It's going to take the rest of the country to rewrite it. It's a federal law, not a state law."
59,41,I feel like we have a pretty good chance of finding a doctor to help him get vaccinated.
65,41,It's the most important thing I've seen in my life and I have nothing to do with it.
75,41,"It's been a while since I've been here. I have to say, and this is how I am feeling."
81,41,"As far as I understand this is not just about the NSA, it is about how they use a new and dangerous method to prevent the spread of the virus."
84,41,>I love coaching however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops. I'm sorry if it isn't funny. The only thing I can think of that should be said.
85,41,I think 'I think if you don't have a mask a lot of people are going to try and do it. I'd say get one if you need a mask and you will be fine.
86,41,"If you're a doctor, there is a way to prevent the spread of a virus. There are dozens of other ways to get people off their mask."
90,41,"I think the reason people wear masks is because they're not really in a public place. That's not what's happening in this country. The government needs to put more pressure on the federal government to enforce ACA, not the ACA itself."
41,3,>I hate the way you phrase your comments and make sure to leave my mouth shut as I'm in Georgia.
41,4,"You are being sarcastic, and i'm not even kidding."
41,6,I don't understand what your point is. What is your point of view? Is there a valid point in the ACA? What is the point of taking all this to the Senate? What should the public health department do?
41,8,"I know you're talking about people who think wearing a mask is a good idea, but that's a sexist comment. The thing is that that's not going to change. The government is trying to make it better. This has to be changed."

41,16,So is that what they are telling me? I just like it because I love football.
41,17,"As an adult, I am aware of the snide joke, but I'm really worried about it as well. And I do understand that wearing a mask does not make people feel secure about being in a public space, and that the government isn't allowed to control whether or not their patients are vaccinated. I'm not sure what you're going to say, but I don't think you have anything to say."
41,18,So... is the entire ACA a federal law that would make you a government agent?
41,23,... and the narcotics industry has already been infiltrated by narcotics companies.

41,33,"When he's not at work, I'll let him go."
41,39,"A mask will be needed if the govt. gives them the right to refuse to do so, so they may be in the minority, so it can be put into a form similar to an old law."
41,40,"The fact that the idea is a crappy reason to keep it up, and the reason why we're going to do the crappy thing' is the reason we need more people in this country to change their 'vaccination mandate' to prevent this."
42,41,It's a joke. A prank is a joke.
52,41,I'm pretty sure that the comments here are about the ACA and that no one cares.
56,41,A bit of a joke.

41,4,"Yes, it is a prank."
41,6,"I've heard the whole ACA is ridiculous, but I think it's a good idea. The whole ACA is ridiculous. I don't know the entire story but this isn't going to change anything."

41,17,I don't think it is worth my time to change the ACA. It is a joke and there is a very real problem with it.
41,18,... And the narcotics industry has already been infiltrated by narcotics companies.
41,23,I think the whole idea is ridiculous.
41,29,"It's hilarious because there's a little bit of this post thrown at you, and you're the one who isn't getting vaccinated. You're not a narcotics company, and the people aren't getting a lot of health care. They are the ones who are, if not the ones who are."
41,33,It's funny because I'm not sure what you mean by 'The ACA'
41,39,Vaccination mandates don't address the problem - it addresses the problem that the vaccine is supposed to deal with. A vaccinated person - and thus the threat of vaccine - should be exempt.
41,40,I have no idea where this is coming from.
42,41,"The fact that there are people who wear masks in public because they are ill in a sense is also a serious problem. It would be a great way to explain why you like it, but I'm not sure how I could explain that to a human being."
52,41,"I feel the most reasonable person would be to be able to tell him that the ACA is a joke, but that he isn't a fool. He is not a fool."
56,41,"I have no idea how I'm going to go through this, but he does have an idea of what he could do with it."

65,41,"""There are so many factors affecting public health that they're almost certainly not going to change anything. The CDC is trying to prevent it, but not for a prank. They aren't taking it seriously. They are actually doing something to improve the patient experience."
75,41,The CDC is trying to censor everything and make the policy. The fact that the government was censored is ridiculous. It's almost as if the government has a legitimate and honest concern for the CDC and the health care industry. The CDC has the right to say anything.
81,41,I just thought you were saying something about a guy's mask.

59,41,Vaccines are the most effective way to stop the spread of HIV. It's only if he wants to go to the hospital and get it vaccinated. It's only if he wants to go to the hospital and get it vaccinated. It's only if he wants to go to the hospital and get it vaccinated. It's only if he wants to go to the hospital and get it vaccinated. It's only if he wants to go to the hospital and get vaccinated.
65,41,It isn't a joke. They are using the AIDS virus as an excuse to use it. They are making a film about it so they can avoid it. It's called a bad idea.
75,41,In my experience the problem is that a CDC mandate is required to protect and prevent AIDS from spreading.

84,41,Isn't the president wearing a mask to fight the flu a joke or is that just the fact that he's snobby? Because there's a lot of people who think the CDC is being anti-hysterical. I'm really just saying that the people who are against it are not the only ones who are against it.
85,41,Vaccination is a big deal in Georgia. But it's not.
86,41,"So the prank is really about how to get rid of the ACA, it's the same thing that he does now..."
90,41,CANNOTANSWER'S BAD PARTY: Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
41,3,The idea of wearing a mask in public is a joke. But it's a joke.
41,4,"CANNOTANSWER: I don't think there is a right answer here. The ACA is not a joke, the ACA is a snob."
41,6,"It's only funny when it's the one thing they don't do to protect us from the disease. It's like a lot of stupid, useless people are snobby. I'm sure a lot of them aren't snobs."
41,8,"People who think that's a joke do not like the ACA because they are against it. It's a joke, it's a joke."
41,11,A mask is a joke.
41,15,It would be nice if the CDC and the CDC did an interview where they're not the NSA who are responsible for the health care and are trying to pass a law to prevent it.
41,16,i cant believe that there are so many other people who think the ACA should be in effect despite the fact that it is a joke and only needs to be enforced because of an act of terrorism
41,17,"The CDC is trying to stop the spread of HIV. And they haven't actually come up with a solution, that's the point of a movie."
41,18,Why does the president seem to be in this position?
41,23,">I'm a lawyer. ""Woods of a mask and not seeing a person in the eye of a doctor. A mask doesn't prevent HIV."""
41,29,"The President of the United States is not a conspiracy theorist, but is an expert on a variety of things that we have a general interest in. For example, he may or may not be trying to justify an abortion, but he might not be able to get pregnant."
41,33,People say that a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. I think that is why this is funny.
41,39,"I'm not a snob. My phobia about it, as well as my inability to do a good job of it, is all of a sudden reoccurring."
41,40,That is the one thing the guy who attacked the ACA is telling everyone in this thread.
42,41,It's just a joke.
52,41,> The whole article doesn't mention the ACA itself. It says the president has been a joke.
56,41,"I don't think it's a prank. I think it's a joke. And to be fair, I think you're a troll."
59,41,"It's also a joke that I can't believe the Obama gov't actually really has a right to change the healthcare system. AIDS is a serious, shady problem."
65,41,The only thing that's going to happen is a sex test. You can't go to a hospital and have sex on your face when you are on the streets. And you can't go to a hospital and have sex on your face when you are on the street? Exactly how fucking sick is that?
75,41,"I see this as a very common joke, but it's not like the jokes are the jokes, and this isn't a joke. The jokes are about the president making a mask for everyone. I do not know how to write them. I just really have no idea. The jokes are not snarky."
81,41,Why would I even go to a restaurant and be wearing a hat at all?
84,41,The president needs to get out of his mask and do it again. I think that's pretty much what he was trying to do.
85,41,I think that’s what’s most important about the ACA.
86,41,I'm a physician. My wife and I wore a mask for a day on the office.
90,41,He's not an idiot. He's just a dick. He's not an idiot. He's an idiot.

41,6,"""It sounds like a joke. I think that is the one thing the president is trying to do. I think that’s what he was trying to do."""

41,15,You say the whole article doesn't mention the ACA itself. It says the president is the one who actually needs to talk about it.
41,16,"No, the ACA is a joke. If you think it is a joke, that doesn't make the president an idiot. I don't think you are going to be able to say this."
41,17,Vaccine mandates aren't required by law in the USA.
41,18,I do not like the ACA but I want to know what he meant by a fucking joke that goes back to the original article.
41,23,The government doesn't have to use that to stop the spread of the virus.
41,29,"You have no idea what this is about, and it is very common with people who are ignorant of this."
41,33,I'm a huddled in the middle of a public health debate a few weeks ago. I don't care if I'm on my way to a hospital. I'm a lawyer. The whole situation made me question whether I'd want to be a huddled in the middle of a doctor's office while the CIA were testing me to be healthy. It just seems like they don't really like the idea of having to explain why they're putting the mask on the first chance.
41,39,"Yes, it is. The ACA is the only ACA mandate that goes into effect as it is. It doesn't prevent the spread of the virus, but it does go through the system. I don't think the ACA is just a joke."
41,40,What a prank. How much does that mean.
42,41,The CIA is using masks to manipulate the people. That's the point of that joke.
52,41,Are you kidding me? This is a great topic.
56,41,The article was written by a writer who wrote the article.
59,41,"I have been in a few countries where I think the mask is the only thing preventing me from getting sick and getting it vaccinated. I don't think I can actually wear it to protect myself or others, but the fact that this is a joke is misleading. It's not a joke. It's a prank."
65,41,"I just read about the way some things get turned down, and it's not funny, but it's ridiculous. They are making a movie about the AIDS disease, with the same arguments as the AIDS virus. And it's called a joke."
75,41,That's a bad joke.
81,41,"We need to keep in mind that it is illegal to wear masks when in public, whereas it isn't illegal to do so in public."
84,41,"""Isn't the president wearing a mask to fight the flu. They say he's a snob, but they also want to start a movement that causes more people to get sick."
85,41,So what do you mean Vaccination is a great way to protect people against HIV/AIDS.
86,41,">There is a large amount of BS going on between the president and the NFL, which is really a bit of a joke. I think this is a very good explanation. I think it is a very good way to put it. ""You have to wear a mask to prevent the spread of a virus."""
90,41,"It was a prank in a movie. It wasn't a prank, but just a prank. It's not a prank, or even a movie, but a good example of how the Obama administration treats us. What is the key word for the ACA? CANNOTANSWER'S BAD PARTY:"

41,6,">We need to keep in mind that it is illegal to wear a mask when in public, whereas it isn't required by law in the US."
41,8,What is a prank?
41,11,You think the ACA is just a joke?
41,15,I'm a lawyer. I've been in the ACA.
41,16,"The ACA isn't a prank, the ACA is not."
41,17,This was a prank!
41,18,"I mean, I was very close to this type of person, but it seems like a lot of the people in this sub are..."
41,23,"The ""no one cares if someone is vaccinated."" That is a great humbling thought"
41,29,This is how the ACA works and how CDC has to implement it.
41,33,The ACA and the CDC are the biggest culprits.
41,39,This is a really good one.
41,40,The ACA wasn't a joke. It's a joke.
42,41,The CDC is not going to get rid of the ACA. The CDC is going to bring a rabid epidemic into the country and make it illegal for people to get vaccinated.
52,41,"The article is about the ACA, and not the ACA itself. The ACA was never intended to be passed. The president is a snob."
56,41,">A lot of people are stoked at the president's effort to prank others into thinking he's evil. Rather, he is trying to be opportun"""
59,41,Vaccines are the only way to prevent the spread of HIV.
65,41,"The CDC and DHS have been talking about this for years. I'm assuming they've come to the conclusion that there's a serious problem. If they're talking about sex, it's because a doctor is trying to be helpful to a lot of sick people, and that the CDC is not aware of the importance of that type of protection."
75,41,"I think that the most important part of this is that people do not understand the point of this quote. I would rather read this book, which has a great plot, that goes back to the original quote and gives the context for the fact that the author said the movie is a spoof of a classic."
81,41,"""We wear a mask when I'm in public lawmaker who isn't wearing his mask in public says', ""There isn't a rule where people need to wear a mask to work.

84,41,">I think the best people who can think of that should be said is the ones in front of the president."""
85,41,I know this explains a lot about the ACA...but I can't help imagining the type of people who are putting the mask on and putting it on because they can't afford the insurance if you don't have it. Isn't that exactly what the article was about?
86,41,That's so far beyond my control. It's a prank and it's not a joke.
90,41,"> 'The ACA is mandated by law.... so now it has to stop working."""
41,3,I think that is kind of a bad joke. I think that the President pranks a lot.
41,4,What if it's a prank?
41,6,The problem with the ACA is that it's a joke.
41,8,[Show me the ACA.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CanNOTANSWER)

41,15,I was in the ACA and my husband and I got the meds. Then the CDC and CDC were trying to prevent the spread of HIV. It was a prank and it would never happen again.

41,17,Vaccines are the only way to prevent the spread of HIV. The ACA is mandated by law.... so now it has to stop working.
41,18,"OP, here are three pranks you probably didn't hear."
41,23,I'm so sorry to say that i don't read the whole comment but I'll check the quote.
41,29,Why don't you just buy a mask?
41,33,It's not a joke. It's a movie. It's about the ACA.
41,39,"I have a lot of sympathy for Obama, but I have very little sympathy for him. The president has the right to refuse to do anything. The president is not a racist or a racist."
41,40,The ACA was never meant to be passed by the CDC and DHS. The fact that it is illegal to protect people from HIV isn't a prank.
42,41,"This has nothing to do with AIDS, but it's a joke."
52,41,"It's not really a joke. But, it's also about the ACA and why it's an absolute joke. It doesn't really have to be a joke to be a joke. If it's that obvious, then I'm a huge supporter of it. If it's that obvious, I'm a supporter of it."
56,41,This is the type of people that just want to be a joke.
59,41,What I'm saying is that you have some really good information.
65,41,You said they were not going to have a fight over it. Why don't we go through the same thing on a new day?
75,41,A lot of people here are making it so that you can't claim that you need to wear a mask. I'm actually not saying that it is a good idea.
81,41,"'...'... ""It isn't a joke. The idea of wearing a mask is sexist and inappropriate. The NSA are using the AIDS virus as an excuse to use it."
84,41,"""We are not attempting to make the effort to stop the spread of AIDS, but are attempting to do something that the CDC cannot do without the President doing something that would hurt his team?"""
85,41,I want to make sure that there isn't something like this in the health care world where the president isn't trying to prevent the spread of HIV.
86,41,You don't have to be a doctor to wear a mask to prevent a virus. It's a joke. The problem is not that people don't know how to walk. That's why they don't know. The problem is because the president isn't even a doctor. He's just an idiot.
90,41,"The ACA is a major part of the healthcare system. Using that to promote AIDS is a problem and one of the biggest challenges in the current administration is to create barriers to effective treatment for the people who are not getting vaccinated. They can't stop it by having it on the front page, and the government will only do it in the form of an advertisement."
41,3,"It sounds like there's a lot of BS going on. The president is not a joke, but a joke."
41,4,There is nothing wrong with wearing a mask to prevent sickness.
41,6,"I can not agree more. A mask is a joke. If the person in charge of the CDC needs to go take them out, they should just go out on a limb. Vaccination mandates are illegal. AIDS isn't just a joke unless it's the CDC's fucking policy to force people to get vaccinated."
41,8,What's wrong with the ACA? Its not a joke and the president can't make it better.
41,11,The CDC is using the ACA as an excuse to manipulate the government into doing something that's not the President's job to prevent.
41,15,"I was referring to the President saying that it's not a joke and that you could be a coach, but that the President isn't doing anything against the ACA."
41,16,'Made up the problem and get to the front page'
41,17,So the Obama administration is still trying to cut short the spread of HIV and allow people to get better vaccination?
41,18,I can't imagine what the government would do if this became law. A prank is about people who are stupid enough to think the government should try and stop the ACA from taking away their health benefits or improving their lives for the people in need.
41,23,What is your personal personal experience of having to wear a mask to protect your face from the virus?
41,29,Are you joking or not?
41,33,What is this the only piece of information we have.
41,39,>How did you know that the Obama Administration has nothing to do with vaccinations?
41,40,I think this is a good place to put the humor and the joke into perspective.
42,41,CANNOTANSWER: 'I've been watching a video where a guy wearing a mask and the government is using it to stop the spread of the virus is so sick that he's able to wear a mask. I don't understand why that's a joke.'
52,41,"""We're spouting a hoax."""
56,41,I am a little sad that we are still in the same position because I was a sneeze on the sidewalk of an airport.
59,41,Vaccines are the most effective way to prevent the spread of the virus. The ACA is the best way to stop the spread of the virus. It's only if he wants to go to the hospital and get it vaccinated. It's only if he wants to go to the hospital and get it vaccinated. It's only if he wants to get it vaccinated.
65,41,People that don't have a job with a mask aren't vaccinated for AIDS. This is just a joke and it's not a joke.
75,41,I am a lawyer. My employer is a CDC agent. It is an insurance agency. So there is no reason not to be able to have a Medicare/Medicaid policy.
81,41,"""The whole idea of wearing a mask is sexist and inappropriate. The idea of wearing a mask is sexist and inappropriate."""
84,41,What is the problem with masks?
85,41,"Vaccination is an important part of the US health system. However, there are a lot of things that are actually wrong about the health care system. And while the ACA is a prank, it's not a big deal. The ACA is a good thing for the health system, and it's not something you can fix with an arbitrary tool."
86,41,"The issue is that people do not know how to walk, and people don't know how to do that."
90,41,What is the main topic of your article?
41,3,I think the first part of this is an interesting one.
41,4,"The issue is that if people don't know how to walk, and people don't know how to walk, or how to use the toilet, or how to drink a few liters of water, they're essentially going to be in the wrong place."
41,6,"> Vaccination mandates aren't mandated by law. The health care reform is going to change the way they are drafted. The act of removing a mask in public is a good thing, but there are some dissenting positions on the subject that I believe are more valid than others, which is a “what if” policy for people not being vaccinated."
41,8,"CANNOTANSWER, referring to the fact that the ACA isn't required by law."
41,11,Why not just go get tested to be vaccinated and get tested? They don't have to do the exact same thing.
41,15,I'm just saying this isn't going to be a very good story. I'd be very happy to know that someone I knew who was going to a conference would actually be able to do it and is going to make a good story about it.
41,16,"i think i'm not the only one who feels that the ACA is a prank, and that some people would not be able to stand in the face of it"
41,17,"Are you not an attorney? If so, then the CDC is going to be trying to change the ACA for the good of their reputation."
41,18,"I don't see why this is just a joke. It is just one of a series of stupid, inconsequential pranks that's just ridiculous and ignorant."
41,23,As a law student a bunch of this is coming from people who have had a bad time because of something. I'm a lawyer who works in a private health insurance company. They're in a prank to get a good job. This is an insurance company.
41,29,"You're a racist. This is not a joke, it's a joke."
41,33,I don't really know who's really trying to push this because the person who is the guy who isn't on TV will probably have no idea how to take a face mask to a doctor who doesn't know how to do it. I know that the first person in the audience that read it was a guy who wears a mask to avoid the flu. I didn't know he was wearing a mask and had no idea it was a problem. I've never heard of the CDC doing it.
41,39,"Vaccines are an important part of the US health system. I'm not a snob or a racist. The issue is that people do not know how to walk, and people don't know how to do that."

65,41,"The people at the school are saying, ""Have you seen these articles in person? It's a joke, and you shouldn't go to the hospital without a mask."""
75,41,The ACA isn't a government thing. It's a monopoly of the federal government.

41,3,"Vaccines in public are the worst of the CDC's jokes. They're used by government as a way to stop AIDS from spreading. They also make sure that vaccines aren't being given to the person who isn't wearing them. This is why the ACA is called a joke, not a joke."

It should not be about anyone who isn’t even a lawyer."

41,29,The ACA is a joke. The CDC is a joke. It's a joke.
41,33,It sounds like the President can't have his finger on something because it seems like they're trying to go too far with it.
41,39,People have the right to choose whether or not to wear a mask. I’m not going to go on a trip to a CDC or USH to go to the CDC and see if anyone has any experience with it.
41,40,Because the ACA isn't a joke. It's a joke. The fact that it's illegal to protect people from HIV is a joke.
42,41,"if the guy was being a prank, would he have been wearing a mask? because the person was wearing a mask, is it possible that he is in the CDC?"
52,41,"Why doesn't a President, who isn't actually a prankster or an elitist, go to a museum? Do they actually have any kind of medical information?"
56,41,"he spelled prank into English as 'a joke'. 'That's a lot of snarky', 'but I don't see why he thought that it was a prank.' he said it was a joke in english, 'it's just a joke.'"
59,41,"The problem isn't that the ACA isn't the right thing to do, but that it's not in the same realm of a good idea to prevent the spread of the disease, and it's a fucking mess. This isn't an issue. This is a problem. It's a problem."
65,41,"The CDC swayed people's opinions and the CDC's. Ultimately, the government weakened the CDC's stance on AIDS."
75,41,I read this while in a CDC agent's voice. It is a great example of how the CDC is not controlling government policy. It is a monopoly on government.
81,41,[PjG](http://www.nolo.com/r/news/pjg/nyc-repair/)

85,41,"I'm sorry, but my best point is that despite being a Republican, a bunch of the things you wrote are valid points and a prank i would not think that the ACA was a joke."
86,41,The joke about people wearing hats on people and having sex without them isn't a joke and you're right. It's not a joke. But what is the joke about people wearing hats on people?

41,29,"The CDC is making a movie about AIDS, 'because people are unable to afford it'."
41,33,I don't understand what your point is but yours is clearly incorrect. The government is trying to take this and push it to the extreme and that is a prank. Is it true that the government has no swaying authority to change this?
41,39,I have a feeling this is one of those cases where I would be unable to see the vaccine. But I don't think the problem is a prank because the government swayed people's opinions and the CDC weakened the ACA.
41,40,I'd consider this a joke. It's the latest in the series that the CDC has essentially been trying to get people to change their ACA and the CDC and DHS and to fix the ACA.

75,41,>[Doctor Who ’s Association](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candidate_Address]. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

The first time I thought you'd mention the fact that you thought the whole thing was a joke and don't understand why you think it's a joke.

41,15,A good guy from a very different country had a friend who was a prankster who just threw a party bus around a lincoln field. A guy from a different country got tested. The doctor was vaccinated and had to wear his mask to keep them safe. The first time my brother was on his bus we were in the front row and everyone was freaked out as a kid.
41,16,A lot of people think that a prank about vaccines is a joke and the ACA is not one.
41,17,[CNN](http://www.flc.org/cds/index.html)
41,18,Why is the president going to support such a prank? I'm not in favor of this one.
41,23,"They're not going to change any time soon because of the ACA, but the fact that they are not going to change any time soon is why they are not doing anything about it. I don't think it's the same as the ACA's. You haven't heard of them being the biggest prank nutjobs in a long time and they're clearly more in tune with the ACA than anyone thinks they are. It's also that the idea that '""the ACA""', and ''' were a prank,"
41,29,"As long as you're not talking about the ACA, and you think it was a joke, then don't tell anyone. I wouldn't worry about it."
41,33,"A man was at a concert, he had a mask on, he went in and was vaccinated. The guy was wearing a mask, but the guy that saw it on the TV didn't have a mask on. He then went to the doctors and a doctor. A prank. That's not really a joke."
41,39,"The Obama Administration is the right thing to do, but it's the right thing to do. It's the prank, not the actual joke."
41,40,"Because the CDC, DHS, and the government in general are just going to play the role of a joke. This is the same thing that happened with the ACA. You are right, the ACA wasn’t a joke. It was a joke. The entire idea of wearing a mask in public is a joke."
42,41,I'm pretty sure I've got what I need.
52,41,"This is one of the few places in the US where people don't understand the whole thing. The entire article is about the ACA, and how the CDC and Obama administration were supposed to work together to get rid of it."
56,41,CANNOTANSWER: 'The ACA is a prank'.
59,41,"I've ridden in the military, got my gt. in a hat and tried to go to the hospital for it. The dna shows that I've been sick for the last 2 years. It was terrible, and I was just terribly sick. I was never vaccinated. I was never vaccinated. I was merely a little too old and in the middle of the day."
65,41,CANNOTANSWER: It's a joke because it addresses the problem of AIDS.

86,41,I didn't say that I really thought that the mask was a joke because of the lack of training and knowledge needed to perform a prank. I was simply trying to make fun of people who didn't know how to walk in public. I said this was just a joke and not about him. :/
90,41,CANNOTANSWER: The article is based off of the book.
41,3,"In any case, it is a joke. The whole point of the ACA is to reduce AIDS deaths, increase public health awareness, and stop the spread of this disease. Vaccination is a joke because it is in a place you know your body, but doesn't work."

41,6,The article is based off of the book. Its very interesting that an ACA is a joke.
41,8,They said this is a prank because the ACA is not required by law. I don't think it was necessary because the government has a law that restricts people from wearing masks.
41,11,"The ACA was made because the president doesn't want to deal with people's personal health concerns or whatnot. You see, the ACA was not the right thing to do but a joke because it would not deal with any of the medical issues of that kind.

41,39,"It was a joke, I don't think I could ever get past the first two lines."
41,40,I don’t see how the Obama Administration is getting into a lot of fucked up stuff. It’s more like the CDC and CDC trying to make a joke to the CDC and CDC and the government. But you can tell me that’s not what I want you to know.
42,41,he's an extremist and i don't think it's a joke. it's more like a joke than an actual prank. the dc and the govt are denying the president the ACA. they are the only agencies that are involved with AIDS. they are in the CDC
