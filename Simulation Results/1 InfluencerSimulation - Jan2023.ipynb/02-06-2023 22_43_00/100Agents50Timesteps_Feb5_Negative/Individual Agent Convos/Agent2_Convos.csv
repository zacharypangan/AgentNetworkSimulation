21,2,"This is true... a person who has a gun has no idea what a tampon looks like. I wore a tampon when I was a kid, and the only person I wore a mask when I was a kid had a gun, so it got in my bloodstream."
22,2,This is one of the dumbest things I've ever done in my entire life and i have done a lot of dumb things I'm going to say this about twitchcon and masks you can hate me
55,2,You can't just walk away.

82,2,"OP, there are no statutory mandates or laws that make them illegal. That is, they are only used for a number of reasons."
84,2,I am pretty sure this is a fact. I am just going to go ahead and say that I am just going to stop doing what it is gonna do. But I don't want to hear anyone saying I am a bit out of touch about it.
85,2,"No, we can t. We just cannot wear any of the things we already wear on our shoulders. That is what we do."
88,2,">The people are in the state, and the states can have all kinds of mandates to not wear a mask."
90,2,This is the sort of thing that makes me angry about that guy wearing a mask and being a narcissist.
93,2,I don't believe in the government's ability to ban the wearer of a mask. The government can ban people from wearing a mask or getting the jab if they want not by force.

2,1,You gotta love that shit when it comes to the shit that comes with putting a mask on?
16,2,"It is not an aha because it is just a statement. The person is being lied to about. He isn't on a horseback ride to get the vaccine, and it is a hat. That's what he's saying."
17,2,You mean they don't wear a mask? You mean you don't need a mask to put yourself at risk for being vaccinated.
21,2,He wore a mask. He has a gun.
22,2,"As someone who has never actually seen this fucking movie, I can honestly say I hardly understand the context of that."
55,2,This shit is on the way. The gov't is supposed to protect those who are vaccinated. This is not the government or anyone elses problem.
64,2,I read this as: 'wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
74,2,"In our state the government has to put a protective barrier on their throats, so that anyone who is bitten by a virus can be screened for it and the hives from it aren't exposed."
75,2,I don't understand why you wouldn't go to a mask event.
80,2,"Yeah, we get it. The government isn't really supposed to do anything for the NSA. There is an actual rule that allows the players to wear a mask to stop the spread of viruses. But it still causes problems with your ability to choose to wear the mask."
82,2,"You can wear the mask and say, I want a job and not a job. I don't care what the law says or how much I have to live by if I get a job and not wear the mask, because that will be impossible. You can wear the mask as a last resort."
84,2,"He is in no way representing the ""prohibition of a virus."""
85,2,So people who wear masks and get shot are just getting shot?
88,2,"Vaccinated people in Colorado still have a problem with the masks, which is a big concern for the CDC. The issue is with them not being able to go to a vaccinated state because they haven't tried the vaccines yet."
90,2,"""The government is spreading a virus to people that can’t even pick it up without a mask, which they say is an excellent reason not to do so."
93,2,"I think the person who's on the run is doing a lot of good, because they want people to be more free to choose and spend their money than they are without a mask."
100,2,A lot of people don't realize how terrible it is for a person to be wearing a mask when they aren't actually actually breathing.
2,1,You're a narcissist. What a shit guy.
16,2,I think this is a good one.
17,2,"i would be very sad if i were a candidate for Vermont and i could see the film ""Rogers of the Past"" (which is also a movie, and this movie is a very interesting one, but it's a great one as well."
21,2,This is a really dumb part of the whole political issue.
22,2,"It is a joke. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I want to bring you a mask that i will wear to work and not one that i wear to school or work This is a pretty basic way to get sick. Obviously if you get sick and don't know how to get sick, you can 't go outside without a mask. If you have a mask, you are not going to be able to live in it."
55,2,Why do you want to have a lawyer say it?
64,2,"I was there when I went to go to a lecture and they're pointing out the problems with the lack of communication among the public. It's not just the government, it's the govt, and I'm not sure you can find any other support in this thread."
74,2,"I just can't believe that I haven't heard the term maroon, but I know that it's not one that people who wear a mask can think about."
75,2,This seems like a very good idea.
80,2,That is probably because they aren't making any rules about whether you should wear a mask. They are allowing the players to be able to be the one who is in charge of your team.
82,2,CANNOTANSWER is describing a piece of information from the ACA that has been made public by the state. You could ask him to explain how the mask works.
84,2,"In my opinion, wearing a mask when I get sick and if I do, I will resign."
85,2,> Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.It is really the only one in the country without a mask. It's really the only one in the country without a mask. It's so sad that we continue to have such a dismal policy in place - that we may have to be more proactive and stop this from happening to people.
88,2,They're not a thing. They're a matter of how you get the CDC to mandate you to not wear masks. I'm a vaccinated person and the CDC has not made it any worse.
90,2,"Nope, but it does. Apparently we are not able to prevent a virus from entering the United States."
93,2,You don't believe in the government's ability to ban people from wearing a mask. The government can choose to put people on a mask. But it would be more effective to have people stop assuming that people would be allowed to. The government is imposing mandatory health care laws on all citizens and its employees.
100,2,"This is a great thread for you. If you are not a good person, then this is not the right place to start. I am sorry that you have to go through this."
2,1,"I'm a big fan of masks and the ACA. This whole government thing is ridiculous, and is not even in the context of the ACA."
16,2,"I'm a Republican, and a Republican. But my name is Yoko Ono."
17,2,I would think this was pretty obvious to anyone in charge. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of a virus. Please wear masks.
21,2,The mask is an important part of any job.
22,2,"I read the title and it said ""Use masks and get vaccinated is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. I don't understand how this is such a common phrase unless it has something to do with the person in the video? It sounds like we are in the minority. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of a virus. Please wear masks."
55,2,"This is where the internet comes in handy. It's not just a joke about the government or anything, it's a joke about the fact that a politician is doing it to keep the public safe. It's a joke about Trump being the president of the US."
64,2,"It's not just the government, it's the government and they are saying a lot about the virus and you should put it on."
74,2,The government is going to have to do a lot to help stop the spread of this disease. There is one thing I'm more worried about...
75,2,The CDC does not have mandates to prevent the spread of the virus. Vaccines are not an unavoidable part of the program.
80,2,"I like to think of it as wearing a mask as part of the NSA’s job security, and the fact that they make a ton of money on the process that they use."
82,2,I'd like to read the title to clarify some things about the ACA.
84,2,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
85,2,"Is Vaccination the best option to stop the spread of the virus in Georgia? It's hard to tell because no one is sure what it will be like. I do, but it's also hard to know what it is."
88,2,I was not expecting a lot of news when this video started.
90,2,"That's what I thought of the video, but it's sexy, and so does any of the comments on this subreddit."
93,2,"This is a great example of what the government is trying to do, even if it is a small part of a complex system, and not the government's, but everyone's. This sounds like a big problem to me, and I don't really think that you can convince me otherwise."
100,2,It's not about how a mask works. It's about why people think it's a bad thing.
2,1,"The ACA was a joke about the government, not a joke about the president."
16,2,"We are in a period of time where it has not worked. I was wondering what the answer was for the ""'I'm not getting the vaccine yet, but I hope the first time you call me was going to be a joke""?"
17,2,The film is a rogue movie.
21,2,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
22,2,"Vaccination is NOT a nitpick. The government wants to prevent HIV transmission. When you're playing a sport like football, you can't tell if a person is going to play or not. People are going to do the same to the world."
55,2,"Wearing a mask in public, the only way to be protected against the virus, is to wear a mask. I don't see how a politician doing it would do that to any other person. The real answer is the US government."
64,2,"I'm not a doctor, but I've heard of people who say this a lot in the past, and they have come to accept that wearing a mask can help prevent the spread of the virus. I have been using it for the last 30 years. I have to be vaccinated for every new gen of HIV."
74,2,"What is the definition of a ""skin numbness""? Is it a thing? Why can't you just say that when you don't know you're sick of it?"
75,2,Vaccines are an unavoidable part of the program.
80,2,"They are doing that for the safety of the American people, not the health of their nation."
82,2,The issue is not how it's supposed to work.
84,2,"I'm just talking about how many people are genuinely out of touch about the whole thing? I mean, you're a coach, and you know why. How does that even sound? I mean, he needs to get his hands in his mouth or something, and then go through the motions of saying, ""Hey, we're doing the best that we can do."""
85,2,"I can't even remember a time where the presidential candidate wore a mask when he was president, so i have no idea why he did that."
88,2,Why did someone post this on here?
90,2,"Is the health care industry going to continue to fund a guy that hasn't got in yet? If not, how do you plan to keep him there?"
93,2,"The President has the right to ban the wearer of a mask, he can't decide whether to do so, but I think it's important that people realize that."
100,2,"This is an interesting and common thread, and it sounds like the most egregious thing you've ever heard."
2,1,"It's just a joke. You are right that if you don't get it, you are at risk for contracting it. If you don't get it, then you are at risk of contracting it."
16,2,"I'm not sure what to think, but I would expect it to be a rap. And I want to be able to get vaccinated."
17,2,It isn't a rogue movie. It's the one that satirizes you for your opinion. This man deserves a lot more attention than he gets for his work.
21,2,"I don't think the article is ""trumps"" but we're in the midst of an ACA crisis. The ACA is a political problem and this is not the only part of the issue."
22,2,"I think it's an example of a lack of proper protection. Vaccines are not the right, you should not have to do it. Getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks."
55,2,"A lot of the time, it's because we want to protect ourselves from AIDS. There are so many issues that are not directly related to AIDS. You are not just going to be protected against the virus."
64,2,"""It's not just the government, it's the govt, and I'm not sure you can find any other support in this thread."""
74,2,It's not just a joke. It's a joke.
75,2,I wouldn't go to a mask event. I would be willing to take a risk. I would be willing to take a risk. I'd also be willing to try to convince people to get vaccinated because of the lack of masks.
80,2,"I don't think it is sexist at all. That is part of what I think people should be doing. I believe that we should be able to use masks on ourselves, or else we are not allowed to do so."
82,2,"The most downvoted post of all time. The fact that the people in the video here have stated they are against the ACA as the ""main issue"" which is causing many people to suffer AIDS, not just the ACA, so they are against it."
84,2,I know that it sounds ridiculous but I think the reason the current healthcare system is failing is because the government does not want to take it to a whole new level.
85,2,Why didn't they want him to wear one?
88,2,I think you're misreading the topic and are being sarcastic.
90,2,This has some serious implications for all the other topics:
93,2,"The wording is a bit out of line, but there's a great bit of background for the question:"
100,2,">This is an interesting and common thread, and it sounds like the most egregious thing you've ever heard."
2,1,"The fact that the people in the video here have stated they are against the ACA as the ""main issue"" which is causing many people to suffer AIDS, not just the ACA, so they are against it."
16,2,You think I'm an idiot for wearing a mask?
17,2,Is the CDC going to keep an affidavit with all of the media saying that the CIA is not a part of the health services for 'Vet' and 'Vet'?
21,2,">The President is the leader of America and he should not have to wear a mask for that reason, just be the leader of America, but I think it is a joke."
22,2,"Vaccination is not a nitpick. The government wants to prevent HIV transmission. When you're playing a sport like football, you can't tell if a person is going to play or not. People are going to do the same to the world."""
55,2,"We do not have to go back and change our masks to protect ourselves against AIDS. If the government does that, we would have no incentive to do it."
64,2,I think it would be interesting to hear what people have to say when the other guy is talking about HIV/AIDS.
74,2,This is a very common ailment that isn't well understood. It's not just a joke. It's a joke.
75,2,Is that what the president and his allies are talking about here? Is this how the Bush administration is putting it?
80,2,"Is that the government's role in the public health system? Because, hey, the government is acting for national security."
82,2,"It's just a big piece of the puzzle. The ACA prohibits the use of other medicines a person may use to get AIDS. It's an anti-Semitic act which is a real thing to get passed in Congress, and is used to stop the spread of HIV."
84,2,"I am not a president, but I do like the movie (Ask the president why he is a president)."
85,2,"If you have to tell a reporter that this is a federal matter, you need to say something."
88,2,I've been in Colorado for almost 5 years and my mother has never said I'd want to go to a vaccinated state.
90,2,A lot of people think the ACA is ridiculous. I'm just sad.
93,2,"There is a bit of background to this, but there's a great bit of text and it's titled, ""We are not against vacks mandates"" (#1)"
100,2,"He said, ""There is a stigma attached to it."""
2,1,"The ACA prohibits the use of other medicines a person may use to get AIDS. It's an anti-Semitic act which is a real thing to get passed in Congress, and is used to stop the spread of HIV. I've been in Colorado for almost 5 years and my mother has never said I'd want to go to a vaccinated state."
16,2,Yes. You have to be on the safe side of your health insurance. This isn't a'real' question because it's not a valid one.
17,2,So what he's doing with the mask he's wearing isn't a prank?
21,2,I don't think the Obama / Bush era was too much of an issue. I don't think the GOP are the ones that are going to win a majority of delegates to the Electoral College. Electoral College has been getting a lot of support for some of these issues. It seems that Obama will not be the Electoral College until at least the next election.
22,2,> Is this an example of a lack of proper protection?
55,2,I think this is really good information and I've read several times and it's just something to consider.
64,2,"Are you gonna lie to me? This isn't the same thing. In America, you don't have to be vaccinated to stop HIV/AIDS. That's a problem."
74,2,"If you like this movie, I think you might as well go buy a mask that will help the hives be removed."
75,2,"> ""I am against the government. I don't think they can prevent the spread of a virus, they just have to give you a mask."""
80,2,I don't think it's that crazy. I'm more concerned with the fact that this guy is being abused.
82,2,The anti-Semitic acts aren't the biggest problems in the US.
84,2,"It's one of the things the white house does, it needs to be pushed to keep the President, not to let it shit off."
85,2,"If a person gets shot and doesn't wear a mask, it may be a good idea to stop it from spreading. If you don't, you might get shot and it won't be a good idea. But the thing is, there is a reason you wouldn't get shot, and it's not because you won't wear a mask, but because you don't want to."
88,2,"Vaccines are an important public health issue, but they are not going to stop the spread of a virus. The CDC is working on it to stop that."
90,2,It's not a sexist thing.
93,2,"Yes, the article is titled ""We are all against vacks mandates, and this is one example of a government being opportunistic."""
100,2,">'The biggest thing is the stigma - he can't stop wearing it. I think it's more of a reaction to the fact that he's telling his friends, ""I do like wearing a mask, but I do wear a mask when I'm feeling really bad."" I think it's more of a reaction to the fact that he's telling his friends, ""I do like wearing a mask, but I do wear a mask when I'm feeling really bad."" I think it's"

22,2,"People who don't even know the basic rules of football are a prick, and the government is a prick."
55,2,i read this article several times and it sounds like he wrote it incorrectly.
64,2,In the US you don't have to be vaccinated to stop HIV/AIDS. That's a problem.
74,2,This sounds like a great joke. That's like how a real life movie sounds.
75,2,The issue is that you should not use a mask to sabotage the spread of HIV. It's not the right choice to do it and it is not right.
80,2,It's a crime and doesn't make sense to impose it on a player.

17,2,There's a big difference between a fad and a joke. The best thing they can do is to tell the world who they are and not the joke.
21,2,"The guy is the leader of America and he should not have to wear a mask for that reason, just be the leader of America, but I think it is a joke."

75,2,"Yes, the government is a monopoly and a monopoly if it is a monopoly it will be a monopoly."
80,2,"It is a crime to impose a mask on a player and is a crime to not be allowed to wear one, which is a crime. It's not sexist or ridiculous to impose it on a player."
82,2,The ACA has been removed from the system several times in the last 10 years. It's still the same in many countries.
84,2,You need to read the book and read the book. Unless you are actually a lawyer or a doctor.
85,2,Are you a liberal or a conservative? I'm a liberal.
88,2,I'm saying it is very silly to think that people are so ill. They are just being sarcastic.

That's what he's saying."", ""I think this is a good one. I have a bunch of friends who have been in public and my friends told me that there is a very good chance they will have to learn this. It is extremely disturbing and it is terribly unfortunate that they had to learn this. ""The president"
17,2,"The CIA is part of the health care system, and a great number of people don't think they should do anything about that."
21,2,Why is it a joke?
22,2,People can't even do their job properly unless they wear masks. I have a feeling that's not something to deal with but I can honestly say I don't see it as any kind of bad thing. There are very few people who will want to wear a mask to fight a disease and I think it's important to have a mask on at work for at least 24 hours.
55,2,"Why is this funny? It's a joke that is so twisted that if it isn't funny enough, it will get worse."
64,2,"'I was there when I went to go to a lecture and they're pointing out the problems with the lack of communication among the public.

84,2,"If it's an article, I will have it in my head. I'm sure there are a LOT of links but I've never heard of a single sarcastic comment about the troll. It's not because I think it's a conspiracy theory or whatever, it's because I think it's an interesting fact."
85,2,That's what I'm going to tell you.
88,2,"""I don't think you are being sarcastic."""
90,2,This is a real thing not a movie.
93,2,"The ACA was trying to stop the spread of AIDS, so the US resisted changing the healthcare system."
100,2,"Wearing a mask, it seems, is more like a tactic to be a person that has been struggling to cope. The problem isn't his mask, but the shit he is saying to his friends. The question is whether this is okay?"
2,1,Honestly I don't know why I'm not a huge fan of this because it's an amazing story of it all. The ACA was one of the few Obama administration policies that is not just ridiculous. Probably because it's a joke.
16,2,The government is the ones denying people that have the right to be vaccinated.
17,2,"No, the CIA is not part of the health care system. That's the whole point of a mask. That's all."
21,2,"So I have to ask, what's the point of a 'Making masks' in your daily life?"

55,2,It isn't funny enough to get worse. If you don't want to stop a joke you have to be a political party.
64,2,That's a joke.
74,2,"My reaction was... ""Owl, it sucks"""
75,2,>An anti-vaccine campaign is actually a tv-addiction. I'm a doctor and I have been told for years that in order to prevent and spread viruses like AIDS it is illegal to wear a mask.

82,2,"Why don't you come up with the ""I'm in a hurry"" argument."
84,2,It was a troll movie.
85,2,"I don't know how this is related, but there are a lot of things the media and the media have neglected to mention."
88,2,"People are being so sarcastic. The CDC is not overreacting, they are just people who are trying to make it right."

2,1,>The ACA was one of the few Obama administration policies that is not just ridiculous. Probably because it's a joke.
16,2,The most common reason for people to complain about Obamacare in the US is that they are so far from a fully developed part of the government.
17,2,I'm in a very similar position as the person that made the joke when I was a kid. I just told you this. The CIA is not part of the health care system. This is the same man that was talking about the CDC.
21,2,I'm so confused. What is this?
22,2,Vaccines are the best way to stop the spread of a virus.
55,2,I'm sorry to tell you - I just found this interesting. -
64,2,"It's a joke. I don't really know what to say, I'm a cynic, but I like the ACA."
74,2,I am not saying that this movie is bad but it doesn't fit what he says. What is funny is that I can't believe that I don't know how it works.
75,2,"I just read the title. ""The issue is that you should not use a mask to sabotage the spread of HIV. It's not the right choice to do it and it is not right."" """
80,2,"So, why does the president seem to feel he has done so much to prevent the spread of the virus?"
82,2,You're a fool.
84,2,"I know it seems hysterical, but the guy was on camera at the time. He defended the health of the team."
85,2,"I'm sorry OP, but this is what I have read before."
88,2,People seem to be being sarcastic because they don't understand why it's a joke.
90,2,"The movie is not a movie, it is a movie, and it isn't really the thing that's happening."
93,2,The ACA is a system that the US is using to try to fix.
100,2,>The biggest thing is the stigma - he can't stop wearing it.
2,1,There is no such thing as a joke. This is a real lie. We must end it.
16,2,"I feel like my comment is more like ""why don't the president wear a mask when he's out?"""
17,2,We need to do a lot of our own research and research to know what a joke is about.
21,2,It's not a joke. ACA was written to help prevent the spread of HIV. It's a political issue and is a joke.
22,2,This is why I don't like wearing masks to fight a disease.
55,2,i think it is pretty funny that he is a troll.
64,2,>We don't have to be vaccinated to stop HIV/AIDS. That's a problem. That's a problem.
74,2,"You're right. '...and no one wants to talk about that', 'Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
75,2,This is a good question.
80,2,I would call this an act of aggression from the government.
82,2,"As far as the question goes, it would make for interesting discussions about what the ACA is about, but he said that the question is ""How is it a big piece of the puzzle?"" The question is: Are those people actually against it, or do they think they need to get to a point where they're anti-abortion? The question is not."
84,2,Are you aware that this issue is actually really a big deal to the president? Why did they do that?
85,2,"> I am not a conservative. I'm a conservative. I don't like to believe in politics."", ""Are you not a conservative. I'm a liberal. Vaccination is not a good idea.

If you don't, you might get shot and it won't be a good idea."", ""Is it just a good idea because you don't like the idea of a mask."", ""Is it a good idea"
88,2,"> The actual problem is how many people wear masks, and when it happens, they die. Vaccines are the best way to stop the spread of a virus."
90,2,A lot of people think the ACA is ridiculous. I'm just sad. I'm just sad.
93,2,Obamacare is one of the things he doesn't agree with.
100,2,I really do think there is a stigma attached to the mask. It seems like everyone in the world has this. I'm sorry that you're going through this.
2,1,I was at the news for awhile and you have to believe that we’re a fucking idiot to do that.
16,2,>the president is a fantastic athlete and an amazing player. He should put on a mask and play football. Yes.
17,2,There is no difference. It's a joke. It is not a prank. It's just a joke.
21,2,I'm not sure what you mean by that... It doesn't make much sense in the US. What does it mean? Why is the ACA political issue a joke?
22,2,"""We wear masks to fight the flu. We don't care who the title is, I think you know the issue."""
55,2,>It seems the government is too obsessed with the death of the president to care for his mask. Please wear masks.
64,2,CANNOTANSWER:
74,2,"It's about the government, not the CDC. What I can't stand people who think this movie is a satire of a book."
75,2,I'd say it's more like a shitload of people who are having difficulty understanding how the government has got to their point of view.
80,2,What do you mean? You're not saying that you're against it. You're saying that you're against it.
82,2,CANNOTANSWER is describing a piece of information from the ACA that has been made public by the state.
84,2,Yes! We wear masks to fight the AIDS epidemic.
85,2,Are you a member of the ACA? I'm not.
88,2,Vaccines are the best way to stop a virus. Please wear masks.
90,2,I had no idea this was a movie. My wife likes it.
93,2,I'm not even sure what that is.
100,2,He isn't a person who has AIDS.
2,1,"Yes, you are right. If you don't get the vaccine, you are at risk for contracting it. If you don't get the vaccine, you are at risk for contracting it."
16,2,This is a question that is largely a discussion of health and i'm not getting vaccines yet.
17,2,It's a joke.
21,2,"The point of the article is fucking uhhh, that's a joke."
22,2,Vaccination is the best way to stop the spread of a virus. They really aren't doing a good job of stopping a virus. They really aren't doing a good job of stopping a virus. They really aren't doing a good job of stopping a virus.
55,2,You can wear your mask on the streets and in public without being on the street for the entire time.
64,2,[NAME] ''The Obama Effect''': a joke
74,2,It was pretty funny. I like it.
75,2,This is not what the ACA is about. The CDC is a monopoly on government.
80,2,I think it's an inflammatory response and I hope it ends a little better than the president.
82,2,I'm very happy that there is a problem with the ACA. It is a big problem with the people who oppose it. They are anti-semite.
84,2,"I'm not a snob, but... so, I don't know why you got downvoted for a different sentence."
85,2,"I like the 'I'm not a conservative. I'm a conservative. I don't like politics."""
88,2,"I read a book about this a while ago on the internet, and it was pretty good."
90,2,CANNOTANSWER'S BAD PARTY:
93,2,">(The article isn't about the actual president, it's about the fact that the article is describing Obama's policies. It's not a political issue."
100,2,>He said that his doctors didn't tell him. I think it seems like everyone in the world has this. I'm sorry that you're going through this.
2,1,It's a joke. You aren't a dick and you aren't a good samaritan.
16,2,I thought this was funny because I'm in the ACA.
17,2,"Unless the CDC was on a show where they had no idea what the government was doing to the masks, it's going to be a long time before they are allowed to start talking about that again."
21,2,"The most important point of the story is what I am going to give you - it's a joke, and it isn't."
22,2,"I've got a bad habit of reading the headlines all the time, so I have a good chance I'm just saying it a few times."
55,2,"I know a lot of people in the US have been asked to go through an entire set of health screenings, but this doesn't seem like a sexist joke."
64,2,I don't understand why people are taking this as a joke. It's not the government and it's a joke.
74,2,Isn't this just another example of what an 'addiction' is?
75,2,"I'm a doctor and I've been told for years that in order to prevent and spread viruses like AIDS, it is illegal to wear a mask. It's not the right choice to do it and it is not right."""
80,2,"a lot of people aren't even comfortable with the idea that ""the NSA doesn't care about preventing TB spread"" is a joke. They're just a dick."
82,2,It's a big problem in Australia. I'm a huge fan of people who wear masks in order to prevent the spread of AIDS. The ACA prohibits the use of drugs.
84,2,I figured I should be more clear about the situation.
85,2,"Are you serious about the mask issue, which is a bit of a troll joke?"
88,2,You're just saying that people on this sub are often confused when people say I don't want to be vaccinated.
90,2,Honestly I can't help but think about how much it helps the government stop spreading this disease.
93,2,">“Do you think that the people who's on the run is doing a lot of good, because they want people to be more free to choose and spend their money than they are without a mask.”"
100,2,I am not the person who wants to be with this guy.
2,1,I think you're in an interesting position and this is just a little off.
16,2,"I don't think you're being satirical. The president should have been able to have a conversation about what he was saying. :: ""But I believe that people are going against the best of the best. I don't think it would be a big deal."
17,2,"Well, no, we've already got a joke about this that doesn't make sense. I mean, it's not like the CDC is a monopoly, it's just part of the government. So the joke isn't a prank, it's an affidavit."
21,2,What's funny about a joke is that the ACA doesn't have a political message and the joke isn't even in the title.
22,2,I don't think this is funny.
55,2,...then it’s time to go read the entire article. I think it’s going to be a great read.
64,2,"You're a joke, but the word ""i"" is a joke."
74,2,I think the main issue is people who aren't familiar with the healthcare system and can't understand it. A doctor's role in a movie is to get people to know more about health problems that are not addressed by the government.
75,2,"""I don't like how people say the ACA is a monopoly, they just want a monopoly."""
80,2,"The first paragraph is a little harsh and sexist, but this is a bit of an extreme example of this."
82,2,"The article is saying that the ACA prohibits the use of drugs. It prohibits the use of drugs. The article says they are ""too opportunistic to pass anything without the consent of a doctor. The government is responsible for the removal of this weapon."""
84,2,He is not going to get a lot of air time to talk about the problem.
85,2,What a joke. I don't care what anyone says. The idea of being a dick makes me think of being a liberal.
88,2,"If you like a story about an infected person, try it out. It's not really a joke, it's just a joke."
90,2,"There's a whole article about the ACA that discusses how it was a prank, it was also satire and isn't really a prank."
93,2,The ACA was a great example of what the US is trying to do. It is not an issue of government intervention. It is an issue of government intervention.
100,2,"""I'm not the person who wants to be with this guy."
2,1,It's not about a prank. It's about the fact that people who don't understand healthcare policies and what they're doing are a problem.
16,2,"I have a friend who is a Republican and I have a friend who is a Republican. He is a conservative, and he's a conservative."
17,2,It is a joke. Probably not because it is a joke. It is a joke and they aren't. It isn't a joke because it isn't the part of the health care system that's being satirized.
21,2,The idea of using masks is a joke. The issue has to do with not wanting to make any noises about the ACA.
22,2,"I can't speak for the entire CDC, but it's ridiculously obvious that their message is that the ""padding the ACA"" and the CDC is a ""prohibition"" of the spread of HIV."
55,2,"You're a joke. I'm not really sure you want to slander me, but I'm curious about your opinion on this matter."
64,2,"""That's a joke."""
74,2,"""I am not going to 'get sick of it,' it's a bad joke."
75,2,"The president of the u.s. has been saying this since he became president. The CDC and CDC are doing something about the ACA, as they want it to become a monopoly on government."
80,2,"I know you're being sarcastic, but I really think the president is being silly and a dick. You're a dick and a dick. It's sad to see a President that's clearly a dick."
82,2,The biggest problem facing the US is that it's a part of the ACA. The idea of it being illegal for any people is pretty speculative.
84,2,"I have never heard of a single sarcastic comment about a troll movie, even though it's interesting"
85,2,"I would rather you don't believe in politics, as long as you do."
88,2,The CDC does a great job of getting people vaccinated and stopping the spread of a virus. The people in the CDC don't need to get vaccinated.
90,2,He's not saying it's funny but he does say the movie is a prank. I think this movie is an example of how a prank is being taken seriously.
93,2,The question is: What does the president want to stop?
100,2,"""It's a big deal. It's a big deal. a big deal."
2,1,Is it about the ACA that there aren't a dozen people who want to get vaccinated?
16,2,"I don't know what the real reason for people to complain about Obamacare is, but the current administration is probably the best in terms of not having to go to school at least to meet the requirements of the Affordable Care Act (ACA)."
17,2,"""The CIA is not a part of the health services for 'Vet' and 'Vet'?"""
21,2,"I'm so dreadfully sorry, but this is so cynical. What do you think is the most egregious part of the issue?"
22,2,"I think this is just one of those things that makes the whole thread sound like it's actually a good idea. It seems like this sub is going to take a lot of different views than the last one - ""It's just something I don't think is a great idea, or a good one. That's what the current message is about. If you're going to be saying this I'd like to see this movie with you."" It's not like you're talking to ""twitch"" or ""What if I'm not a joke"
55,2,i feel a bit dumb and the government is doing this to prevent it and the government should get rid of it.
64,2,"The ACA doesn't require you to get tested for HIV/AIDS, so the president is not a prankster."
74,2,"I read the book about this with a lot of questions in it, but I didn't get it."
75,2,"No one who has a choice is telling you the truth, so I don't understand why it's in the movie."
80,2,"Its not a crime, it is an act of aggression. Its an insult, it is not a crime. It is an act of aggression."
82,2,"I'm sorry that this post isn't making any sense. This is a huge, crappy post that was written by someone who said the Obamacare was a ripoff of their faith and that the government had made it a ripoff of the Obamacare."
84,2,It doesn't sound funny to me. That's just the way he's responding.
85,2,Well shit you're a dick. Your mom and I don't even live in Georgia. I don't know where your Dad and I live.
88,2,"Well the masks is part of the government's goal in stopping a virulent disease and it's the same thing, it's not the CDC, it's the insurance company. The CDC is not making a big deal about it but it doesn't make sense for the government to do so."
90,2,"There's a whole article about the ACA that discusses how it was a prank, it was also satire and isn't really a prank."
93,2,I think he needs to cut Obamacare down some. It's in the headline.
100,2,"OP isn't saying that it's a big deal, he's saying it's something to be ashamed of. If the problem hasn't been dealt with, why would it be a big deal to him to wear a mask when he doesn't know that it's the real deal?"
2,1,"""I can't wear a mask or get the jab if I want not by force"", ""I would have the opportunity to do that if i were president."
16,2,They said he had to have a helmet to get the vaccine when he was sick.
17,2,That's a very good way to get a joke on people that don't know what a prank is and that's not a joke. That's a good way to stop the spread of a virus. The CDC is a big part of the health care system.
21,2,"I would suggest the gov't look at what's in the article a little more, as the article sounds pretty unrelated to the ACA."
22,2,"People who don't know the basic rules of football are a prick, and the government is a prick."

74,2,"I don't know what the definition of a ""skin numbness"" is, but if you read the book, you'll understand that the whole movie is a prank. That's why it's a good time to talk about the government."
75,2,"I think it's a very simple example of how the government has dealt with the healthcare system. I think this is a really good example of how the CDC is doing a great job of trying to put it into effect. I'm going to have to add you to my list. the CDC is working on making a permanent ACA so that it can be used to control the spread of disease, not the federal government. i.e. to prevent infections from spreading to other diseases."
80,2,I feel like the NSA is a shit guy and this is where this gets kicked out of the conversation.
82,2,"""But it's still a problem, that's a problem."""

93,2,CANNOTANSWER says that the ACA is being used to squander millions of dollars in the federal budget to repeal.
100,2,"It's no big deal if he's actually wearing it to help people who have AIDS. His friends, family, anyone who wears it, haven't done much of anything to stop the virus from spreading. It's not just a scar, it's a scar."
2,1,"You know, I've been here for over a year, and I am sick of all this. My parents' and grandparentss, who are trying to stop the spread of AIDS, all want to get vaccinated as soon as possible. I don't want to be a fool anymore for it."
16,2,>The CDC is using a fucking CDC to fuck up the national health program.
17,2,"The truth is, I didn't read the title of the post. It is a joke."
21,2,That’s a really good one.
22,2,"Vaccination is not a joke. The government is trying to influence policy makers. 'What is sexist is just a joke, but it doesn't seem like it should be."
55,2,>I think it is pretty funny that he is a troll.
64,2,"The article is a prank, not a joke."
74,2,[NAME] and his coworkers are putting themselves out there to get people to get sick.
75,2,"It's not the same as a bad one, but it seems like a good one, because a good one is the same as a bad one."
80,2,"As far as I know, there is nothing wrong with the idea that the NSA is playing a role in protecting the health of the U.S. population, so a CIA is not really a part of it."
82,2,CANNOTANSWER:
84,2,"In the case of 'Nawful'jokes, the President has been acting in a twisted way. He was using his mask to attack the team and apologising. ""This is a joke. You can't be a prankster because of this"" (or ""I think we're doing the best we can do."") He wasn't really trying to get a lot of air time to discuss the issue, and you're an interesting point. It's a big deal. The CDC, with their anti-viral activities,"
85,2,That's a joke.
88,2,Vaccines are the best way to stop the spread of a virus.
90,2,"If you like that, you should probably go to this subreddit and find an article by the guy in the movie."
93,2,CANNOTANSWER is referring to the ACA's opportunism. CANNOTANSWER is referring to the author's ignorance of the ACA.
100,2,"This whole post is kind of like a troll. The guy said he wants a shambles. I can't imagine what the ""shame"" in this post means."
2,1,"The ACA is going to snoop on people. The mask is a joke, he's just being a troll."
16,2,That's one of those jokes that was made to make people think the president is a joke and the NSA is the one who has to make people think he is a joke. That's the worst.
17,2,"I am going to go ahead and tell you, unless I get a prank, you are a prankster."
21,2,A sarcastic joke.
22,2,"It's pretty weird that people in a video don't realize how easy it is to stop people from going out on the field without a mask to help prevent infection, and then you're not going to get sick. It's also weird that people don't realize it's a joke, like it's about preventing diseases."
55,2,"If a politician is doing it to keep people safe, it isn't a joke."
64,2,It's a prank. It's a joke.
74,2,I thought the story was funny because it was written by a conservative who wanted to get people to read the book that the movie is about.
75,2,"Are you an AIDS patient? It is a clobb of HIV that spreads from your skin to other people. The government is not responsible for the spread of the virus, it is not even a part of the healthcare system. There are many problems and there are many people in our country who are in a position of being the problem and needing care. You need more and more people like us to get vaccinated, get them to work and get better. It is a very important problem and it is important for people like you to pay attention to the money."
80,2,"''The first paragraph is a little harsh and sexist. I really think the president is being silly and a dick. You're being sarcastic, but I really think the president is being silly and a dick."
82,2,CANNOTANSWER is describing a piece of information from the ACA that has been made public by the state. You could ask him to explain how the mask works.
84,2,"As a former U.S. Senator, this one is quite funny to me. I'm a great guy. I think there's also a story that a guy in my class was pranking a girl with a mask. That's just what I think."
85,2,People should be able to get vaccines in case they don't have it. The problem is that this isn't about the ACA or that the President hasn't done anything about it.
88,2,People are gonna have a good time and the CDC will continue to work on it. I'm going to go to a vaccinated state with a vaccinated person.
90,2,I don't even remember the whole movie.
93,2,"""The ACA is one of the things he doesn't agree with."""
100,2,"I think you are being a bit extreme. It's not a huge deal, it's just a bit ridiculous. But I'd suggest to him to read the book, or maybe to the guy who drew the line. It isn't the same as any of those books that aren't published. It's a book that focuses on AIDS. You can also read books like [The Secret History of HIV](https://www.reddit.com/r/AIDS/wiki/Dad_The Secret_Remembering"
2,1,This ACA is so important to America that there's nothing else to be said. Is that a joke?
16,2,"I was wondering what the answer was for the ""I'm not getting the vaccine yet, but I hope the first time you called me was going to be a joke""?', ""I hope the first time you call me was going to be a joke""?', ""I'm not sure what to think, but I would expect it to be a rap."""
17,2,"That doesn't sound like a real job. A lot of people say ""I'm going to go ahead and tell you, unless I get a prank, you are a prankster."", ""There's a big difference between a prank and a joke. The best thing they can do is to tell the world who they are and not the joke."", ""The best thing they can do is to tell the world who they are and not the joke."", ""No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,"
21,2,CANNOTANSWER.
22,2,I don't understand why you're not using humor to smuggle sexist shit across the board? It's not about preventing diseases.
55,2,"That's a joke. But then again, the article is an original."
64,2,"The ACA doesn't require you to get tested for HIV/AIDS, so the president is not a prankster. It's a joke."
74,2,The movie was funny because it was about a prank.
75,2,"Having been told this by several people for years that the government is not responsible for the spread of HIV, I believe you would need to be really careful not to go out with a mask, because I am not saying this is a bad idea. I don't have any experience with the government, I don't think the government is responsible for the spread of the HIV, and that they aren't the cause of it, but they are making it illegal for a reason."
80,2,"""I am saying that I am not the president and I am against the president and not the president. It is a sexist and sexist joke."
82,2,"The main problem isn't whether the government revokes or repeals the ACA. There's no law against the ACA, so I'd be less upset about the repeal than the anti-abortion party, as there's some big confusion about what is being fought in Congress."
84,2,It's a joke that you think is funny.
85,2,It's really sad that we continue to have such a dismal policy in place. It's so sad that we continue to have such a dismal policy in place. I'd be upset about a lot of things going on in Georgia.
88,2,"A group of people is going to go to a vaccinated state and they get a mask, but it's no longer a mandatory thing - they are a bunch of people who don't have enough public health care and a lot of people who don't want to."
90,2,CANNOTANSWER'S BAD PARTY: The whole idea of a government acting like a government is actually sexist. The entire idea of a government acting like a government is actually sexist. He said he was a democrat but didn't know how he was supposed to get the job. So he could keep wearing his mask if you wanted. The fact that he was trying to get it out of the hands of a few hundred people is irrelevant. What if a guy is forced to wear a mask?
93,2,I think this is a very good way to get people to have their voices heard in the US.
100,2,"In this case, it's because his friend has been living without AIDS for 5 years. Having a mask in the hospital during that time is not a deal breaker. He's in the middle of his disease and it seems like he is still dealing with it."
2,1,The fact that it is a joke is what gets it spelled 'oh i'm not gonna get the vaccine'.
16,2,"""Why don't the president wear a mask when he's out?"", ""Why don't the president wear a helmet to get the vaccine when he was sick?"", ""I feel like my comment is more like ""why don't the president wear a mask when he's out?"", ""I think it is pretty crazy. Why are you saying it is not really a joke?'', ""You think I'm an idiot for wearing a mask?"", ""I don't think it's the worst."""
17,2,It's not a joke. It's a joke because it's actually a joke.
21,2,He is not making a joke about the ACA. It is a political issue. He is trying to stop the spread of a virus and is referring to the Obama era and the Bush era. I believe the ACA is a joke and I think the government is a rip off of what it is.
22,2,"The article cites the fact that the CDC is actively trying to make this a joke as they need to fight HIV to prevent the spread of HIV, and has even been shown to be a joke. This is the way that the news and news organizations seem to talk about these problems in the current context."
55,2,"It's about the public, not the government."
64,2,"This is a real joke. What is the point of this? Vaccination isn't the first step, it's the second step."
74,2,I hate that stuff. I do like the movie. I think that it is really funny.
75,2,"I’m a lawyer, and my husband is a doctor, and we are all very concerned about the vaccine epidemic. But as a doctor, I am concerned that the government is a monopoly on the government and not a monopoly on it. So I’m gonna go out and say hi, but don’t go to a health event with a mask on. I’m not going to go to the events with a mask. I will not go to the ones that require me to wear a mask."
80,2,It would be a really difficult job for the NSA to do.
82,2,Then he's trying to make an anti-lifestyle aversion for Obamacare.
84,2,No sarcasm here. I’m just joking. And that was a prank. Sadly I can’t even tell the difference between the pranks and the jokes.
85,2,The first one is a joke.
88,2,"In my opinion, it is very important for people to be properly vaccinated so that the CDC can do it for them."
90,2,"The story has been downvoted because the entire article is about the government and the ACA. I don't think the movie is the main topic of the article, but the whole thing seems to be blaming the media, and people having no interest in what that means."
93,2,This is a very interesting title.
100,2,A man with AIDS and AIDS can't stand a real life if he is not wearing a mask. His attitude is too blatantly offensive and offensive. It's also the way that people react to things that aren't his fault and aren't he a bad guy.
2,1,It's the only problem I can think of with this article: It's about a man who doesn't want to be an idiot if he doesn't get vaccine.
16,2,"A lot of people don't understand what 'the ACA is' is about. This is the kind of thing that will not be discussed in the Senate without congressional approval, especially if it's going to come up in public."
17,2,It sounds like they're trying to make a joke about it because they're so clever.
21,2,I think a few points imply that they should stop wearing a mask.
22,2,"As someone who has been working with a non-profit for over a decade, the reason I have been avoiding this sub is because it's just too much shit."
55,2,"""The real answer is the US government."""
64,2,"I was not a doctor, but I have heard of people who say this a lot in the past. I was a doctor, but I've heard of people who say this a lot in the past, and they have come to accept that wearing a mask can help prevent the spread of the virus. I have been using it for the last 30 years. I have to be vaccinated for every new gen of HIV."", ""(I'm not a doctor, but I've heard of people who say this a lot in the past, and they are not. ("
74,2,"I think the way you phrased it could be said to mean ""a lot of people are satirical and they don't even know what the definition of a ""skin numbness"" is."" But that's just the way it works."
75,2,I'm not a lawyer but I read an article about a doctor's mask being illegal.
80,2,He's a joke. I'm saying he's doing the right thing and isn't a dick. And in a good way.
82,2,"It's all about the ""how is it a big piece of the puzzle?"" question. The fact that it's the ""big piece of the puzzle"" question isn't what the article makes any sense."
84,2,The prank was to'slam on the national guard' s team while defending the team.
85,2,"He could be a part of the anti-viral party too, not just the president."
88,2,"> I can say it's not funny. Vaccines are not a health issue, but they are also a hygienic medicine for the people that want to spread the virus."
90,2,"I cried reading this. Suddenly I'm a little discontent and yelled at for being a prankster. I've read this multiple times. It's very interesting to read that I think it's all about the ACA, not that I think it is a prank. The whole thing seems to be blaming the media, and people having no interest in what that means."
93,2,IANAL but i do know what the avd doesn't even mean.
100,2,This is my first sentence of the book.
2,1,"The guy who slapped the federal government's vaccines is a dick. This is what it's all about. It's a joke, and it's not supposed to be funny."
16,2,The whole thing is a joke because it's a joke compared to the actual topic... the CDC is using a fucking CDC to fuck up the national health program. It's the exact same joke that people have on the tv and I want to hear. It's one of the main problems of the system and a problem that a lot of people don't understand.
17,2,"I have to say I have been reading this for a while and the title says a lot of things I am not sure if it would be a prank or a joke, but I don't want to sound like I have been reading too much into it, so I'll just say that it's not a joke, because it's a joke. I mean I think it's a joke, but it makes more sense than this. You are not even doing a good job of making a joke."
21,2,"So the question is, is there something else to consider when the ACA is a joke?"
22,2,The joke is that it's about what the NSA needs to do and that it's trying to push policies against the CDC.
55,2,I agree with what the guy is trying to do here. The only thing is the word mask is not a joke.
64,2,"The Obama effect is a joke because it says ""I don't think that you're a joke, but I have heard of people who say this a lot in the past, and they have come to accept that wearing a mask can help prevent the spread of the virus."""
74,2,"I like the 'Making it a joke' kind of movie, I think I will re-watch it."
75,2,It's a monopoly. They're not making it illegal or stopping the spread. The government has been talking about the ACA since Bush.
80,2,I am the president. My mom is the president and I do not know why this shit gets tossed around.
82,2,CANNOTANSWER is describing a piece of information from the ACA that has been made public by the state. You could ask him to explain how the mask works.
84,2,We wear masks to fight the flu.
85,2,"The issue of whether the mask is a good idea is one of those that is uncalled for in the ACA. It is about whether the US government is helping those who aren't. The President did say a lot about it, and did not do anything about it."
88,2,Vaccines are not health issues. They are not health issues. They are not health issues.
90,2,This subreddit has become more and more like this:
93,2,"Yes, but I don't think you know what the AvD means."
100,2,"This is a very common, very very hard thing to read, because I have a lot of empathy for people who have AIDS. I have always thought that these things would be a problem. I find it really egregious that people are so concerned about these things."
2,1,The only joke I can think of is the one where a man who isn't a dick asks for a mask and the other guy has a snoop on him.
16,2,"Yoko Ono is a joke. The CDC, the CDC, a lot of their execs are Democrats. The problem is that the people who complain about the ACA don't know what the problem is."
17,2,"""It's a joke because it isn't a joke."""
21,2,"People have different political opinions, and have different opinions. I'm very confused about why someone thinks it's a prank and that is why I'm not sure if it has any practical use."
22,2,What is wrong with this guy?
55,2,"A few days ago I saw a movie called ""I'm a man"" on The Viewer in the States. It was about people who had no idea that the U.S. was doing it for the health of the population. I had no idea that the US government was doing it for the health of the people. It is funny because I don't see what the CDC would do with it. I would read it again and see if I could make a more serious and non-competitive comment."
64,2,"The joke of wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is not only a joke, it is a joke."
74,2,"i would think a little prank like this will make your life better. i have to stop being a prank. i can't believe there was a joke, but the movie is a prank."
75,2,The CDC and CDC are working on making a permanent ACA so that it can be used to control the spread of AIDS.
80,2,"In the video, the President states, ""I don't think I would catch the cough if I already had it i'm against them cuz they ruin the economy get people fired and people should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force."", ""(http://www.ssfw.gov/resources/Hash/Mash_Us_Hair.jpg)(http://www.ssfw.gov/resources/Hash/Mash_Ush_I'"
82,2,What is a mask for? You may want to consider the idea that the ACA prohibits other medicines to prevent the spread of HIV.
84,2,A prank is a joke. It's a prank. It's a prank.
85,2,"It's a funny joke, but it's also a really hard joke to make in context. It's actually a joke that the US government wants to repeal ACA but they refuse to change the law."
88,2,It's very easy to say sarcastic when it's not the best word to describe the idea of the federal government as the best thing to do.
90,2,The entire movie was about a prank.
93,2,The article does not contain any other information.
100,2,"They are talking about a very serious and complex disease, the AIDS, and the mental issues with a mask. The problem is that he has a mental disorder. He needs a mask to see people. He needs a sex tape. He needs to get better."
2,1,“It is a joke. You aren’t a dick and you aren’t a good samaritan. This is what it’s all about.”
16,2,"Are you a conservative or a republican? Then, I'd say that's a joke. This is really just the part where the question, ""Is a joke really good?"" seems so absurd."
17,2,It's a joke because it is a joke.
21,2,I do not believe that he has a right to wear a mask to stop AIDS.
22,2,I'm gonna start with the next sentence. That's why I'm trying to get into a lot of weird shit and the AMA is all jokes. Until I finally start being honest.
55,2,I feel like we need to address this.
64,2,That was the joke. The joke.
74,2,I've been a prankster to death. I've made the jokes and now I'm not.
75,2,I’m gonna go tuck a piece of shit into the CDC’s neck and say that’s the kind of thing they should not have.

82,2,The fact that the people who pushed for the ACA are the ones who made it illegal.
84,2,"'I'm not a politician, but I do like the movie (Ask the president why he is a president).'"
85,2,I don't think he is a good candidate for the presidency if he didn't wear a mask.
88,2,It's funny to see people get upvotes about 'no vaccination for the whole state '.
90,2,You have the right to go with your gut.
93,2,It was a great example of what the Obama administration was trying to do. It was a reaction to the ACA. The ACA and the gov't's policies aren't really compatible.
100,2,I don't want to read what I said.
2,1,"This is a joke, it’s a joke. I don’t think the ACA is about a prank, it’s about the government’s treatment of people with HIV. The Obama administration was not a joke and is an important one. It’s not a joke and if it’s really good it’s an important one and it’s a joke, but it’s still a joke and the ACA is a joke."
16,2,"""Was not getting the vaccine yet, but I hope the first time you called me was going to be a joke?"""
17,2,"a joke, a joke, a joke. a joke, a joke. a joke. a joke. a joke. a joke. a joke. a joke. a joke. a joke."
21,2,Why do you think this is the 'trump' article?
22,2,"I had a friend who had been smoking for a couple years and he was getting the flu, and he was allergic. But he didn't want to go into his maternity ward and get vaccinated and the AMA didn't mention it and he was in the right to call it ""shitty "" if it came to him."
55,2,The CDC is a monopoly on government funding and the CDC is not a monopoly on the government.
64,2,I was in a room where people are having a hard time explaining this. I didn't even realize that it was a joke and couldn't figure out what the joke was until I got home. I can't imagine how much they would hate it for that much to have a joke like this.
74,2,"I’ve found this a bit cryptic: I don’t like the hat, it’s a joke and it makes me feel bad that I didn’t even know what a prank was!"
75,2,Vaccines are not health issues. They are not health issues. The people are not healthy. Vaccines are not health issues. Vaccines and STIs are not health issues.
80,2,"There is no question that the NSA is doing what they should do, it isn't. The CIA is working on a virus that has spread into the U.S. ''because it's a problem that's beyond the scope of the CIA'''s control, and that's exactly what they are doing in that respect."
82,2,"So, if you can't find anything else, you need to look up the issue of the ACA."
84,2,"CANNOTANSWER: ""We wear masks to fight the AIDS epidemic. I don't care who the title is, I think you know the issue."""
85,2,The first part of the title was funny. I was just trying to help OP.
88,2,It's a joke based on what I said. The CDC ain't incompetent.
90,2,"I don't see how people can agree that the ACA is a prank, especially because of the way people like the idea of their own mask."
93,2,What's the point of the article? I think the article is wrong and I see the issue is ambiguous.
100,2,The problem is that he is wearing a mask because he has HIV.
2,1,That's the point of this article.
16,2,"That's what the joke was about, is not it? The CDC, the CDC, and the NSA are all using to fuck up the National Health Program."
17,2,It sounds like a joke that's about some other guy who was trying to get the CIA to make a joke. What the fuck. It's a joke and a joke because it's a joke and a joke because it's a joke.
21,2,The reason why you don't think this article is actually a prank.
22,2,"I am a nurse at the CDC. So I have to be at the office for 4 hours, the entire time. I am gonna wear a mask, I do not have a mask."
55,2,"CANNOTANSWER. ""I just started this in one of my favorite movies. I am a very nice guy, and I am a really good person."""
64,2,The movie is just about the virus and the people who are interested in it.
74,2,The hat is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
75,2,I would think that in the next 50 years we could be on to something about the ACA and rethink it.
80,2,"CIA are doing something that is actually working on the CIA's work and not doing any good or doing anything else 'to prevent the spread of a virus.' 'Simply because it isn't an actual problem, the NSA's work isn't. ''They are working hard to stop the spread of a virus. There are a lot of risks involved and the NSA isn''' t really supposed to do anything for the government.'''"
82,2,"OP, there are no statutory mandates or laws that make them illegal. That is, they are only used for a number of reasons. You can wear the mask as a last resort. ""We are 'those'people who want ACA. But this isn't an option, that's a problem."""
84,2,"Vaccination is not an effective prank. It is an important way to prevent the spread of the virus. The CDC, with their anti-viral activities, ""Ask the president why he is a president""."
85,2,Isn't the mask part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus?
88,2,So I have a piece that's not really relevant and I just don't want to be sarcastic.
90,2,"""I would never get into the ACA movie without a mask and a mask that's clearly a prank."""
93,2,"the Obamacare repeal is going to be a major push for social reforms, which will not solve the real problem that Obamacare is going to fix. I think the idea is the same as what Obamacare is."
100,2,I’m going to go along with you. You are a good guy.
2,1,"I don't think that the article is funny enough to really show it's a prank, but it's very well written."
16,2,>I believe that people are going against the best of the best.
17,2,"It's a prank. I'm not going to be a prankster, I'm not going to be a prankster. I just don't like the guy."
21,2,That’s just an excuse to take a day off from the government and not wear a mask for the sake of something else.
22,2,It's more about how the current message is framed than it's what you're trying to make.
55,2,I would like to say that this article is probably the best thing to come across.
64,2,">[I read this as: 'wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.No, this is a movie, but it's a book about the ACA, not the ACA itself. You're saying you think the ACA is a fake, the article is misleading and misleading. This is the first time this has come up. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks."
74,2,"""The hat is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."""
75,2,That's a joke. The government is a monopoly on the government.
80,2,"The president is obviously not a racist, and if you don't like it you are a dick and a dick."
82,2,">We're 'those'people who want ACA. But this isn't an option, that's a problem.'"
84,2,"This is all very very very general information. There is a lot of evidence to suggest that a prank, or a joke, is a prank."
85,2,"Why don't you just keep an eye out for a few things? I'm going to go out on the dates with you, then have the full set."
88,2,Vaccines are a good thing.
90,2,It's an example of the type of thing that is not what we think it is. It's not just a prank. It's about how people treat all Americans.
93,2,The article is based on the same basic idea of an illogical conspiracy.
100,2,You are not in the wrong. You are not in the wrong. He is in the wrong. You are in the wrong. I'm a woman and it's just a problem. You are not good enough to be in a relationship. This is not a good place to be in.
2,1,I agree with the other posters. The article is funny. This is an issue that should not be discussed or discussed with others. It should be discussed with the community and not a politician.
16,2,"If I were a Democrat, would this be about the NSA, or the CDC? Obviously a joke, but not a prank."
17,2,In a joke. The whole point of a joke is to have people come home and get tested to see if they can actually get it. It's a joke.
21,2,"The ACA has been repealed, re-approved, and is no longer a major issue for the US government."
22,2,"I'm sorry, but it's just as much a joke as it is an actual joke."
55,2,This sounds like an incredibly revealing joke. I am going to be incredibly pissed because I think it is a joke to say that someone else is putting on a mask while you are in the audience.
64,2,"Yes, you are a joke. The article is not a joke, the fact that you are being a joke, and the fact that people are just like you, are telling jokes is telling you what the joke is, not what a joke is."
74,2,"I've had a lot of pranksters tell me they are pranksters, that is, the only thing they are not pranksters is their mouths. They've told us to not suck it up because they think they're insufferable and it isn't fair for the people to get infected. It is not a joke, it is a joke."

82,2,The guy has a lot of naiveties on him about how important this post is and how the ACA is.
84,2,And what did that guy say?
85,2,"You mean the problem of the government telling people to do things that make them uncomfortable, like putting on a mask, etc?"
88,2,The CDC pranking Obama is hilarious.
90,2,>I love the movie because I can see how it can make people feel better without them getting infected.
93,2,"The Obamacare repeal was written by an American, not a Chinese. The article has been a little sarcastic, but it still has the troll tags. It is a conspiracy theory. The Obamacare repeal is based on the ACA. The article has been a little sarcastic, but it still has the troll tags."
100,2,I think the post is a little misleading.
2,1,'The ACA is a joke'
16,2,This ain't about the Obamacare. This is about the federal health care legislation and how the CDC and the government are doing something that makes them look like trolls.
17,2,This is a joke. The president of the United States should put people on a mask to stop the spread of a virus.
21,2,"So, to say what else, is not a joke?"
22,2,"Then again, it's just as much a joke as it is an actual joke. It seems like the whole thing is framed as a joke, so I think it is more of a joke than an actual joke."
55,2,"I know you feel bad for trying to get this straight, but I don't know what you think is funny about this. I just felt like this had to be done right. I think you're not the only one who is thinking of what the post is about. It doesn't seem like the CDC is doing anything, but its pretty much a joke. It's a joke that he's essentially telling the lie that the government is trying to do it to prevent the spread of the virus. That it's really funny to have to do, but I still want to see "
64,2,"It's not a joke. It's a joke. A joke because it says 'I don't think you are a joke, but I do want to know why people wear a hat to stop people from walking and then taking off it when they get to my table?"
74,2,My guess is that he's just going to get sick. I've heard the same thing in other comments in the past and the movie makes it all about the government.
75,2,"I can’t wait until a few days, but it’s not too late. It’s going to be difficult to get vaccinated and the government will have no vested interest in vaccinating everyone."
80,2,"I think the NSA is doing what they should be doing, and I think it is the right thing to do."
82,2,">The article has been misleading because it has been written by an American, not a Chinese. The guy has a lot of naiveties on him about how important this post is and how the ACA is."
84,2,It sounds like you have no idea where this is going?
85,2,It was very funny because the other guy did not say anything and was just a naive fuck for a joke.
88,2,"The CDC is really trying to 'prank' Obama. In fact, a bunch of things have changed in recent years. Vaccines aren't a health issue. They are not health issues. They are not health issues. They are not health issues. They are not health issues. They are not health issues. They are not health issues."
90,2,Honestly I can't help but think about how much it helps the government stop spreading the virus.
93,2,This is why the article is called 'The ACA's name'.
100,2,"I feel that a lot of people don't get it. They do. And their way of presenting the problem with a mask, and if he says he's not in a bad mood, they do not know how to make it stop."
2,1,I don't think that's a joke. The article is in my opinion a good one.
16,2,I'm sure you're right - he is a joke and not actually a prankster. he is a dickhead.
17,2,"Yes, that was the joke in this article, and it's an excellent one! I think the only way you can stop people from getting AIDS is to prevent them from being able to become vaccinated."
21,2,I know what it is but I've read some of the articles where you're just describing the current situation as a 'prank'.
22,2,You’re going to get sick from the time you go to work. You’re going to be sick from the time you go to work.
55,2,"If I was a President of the United States, I would be wearing a mask at all times, no matter what the government does. It is part of the measures deployed by the government to assist in stopping the spread of a virus."
64,2,>The ACA is the biggest political challenge in history and is the biggest failure in the last 30 years.
74,2,It is about how the government wants to get rid of the disease. It is about how they want to prevent people from getting infected and how they can use the hat and help others.
75,2,"i think people like you need to do the same in their lives as i do, as they are not a member of the CDC or the CDC."
80,2,I'm going to go rewatch this.
82,2,"OP, is it because the guy is being sarcastic and bringing in a lot of naiveties on him that the masks are supposed to prevent people from getting AIDS?"
84,2,"I think it's one of the ways of describing how he acts, the way he says things, is more humorous than the way he is talking."
85,2,I really hope this isn't a conspiracy: this was the first comment to get to the top of the thread.
88,2,I'm gonna take a break from the sarcasm.
90,2,This is a very real topic. The fact that he did that in his book is pretty funny.
93,2,"""Cannot""? The article has been a little sarcastic, but it still has the troll tags."
100,2,"> ""He said that his doctors didn't tell him. The reason it's a very serious and very common illness. The CDC is trying to stop the spread of a virus."
2,1,"It's not a joke, it's an important issue."
16,2,Its a joke. It's about the ACA. It's about the CDC. It isn't a joke.
17,2,I'm really not sure how to say the difference is so important - I can't really say it's the only way.
21,2,"I was in the United States in 2003 and I lied to the Post Office about it, and they made it clear that they weren't willing to give any advice about the ACA. They were not able to do so. I think that is the kind of thing that is really infuriating and embarrassing. But I think it's also not a joke, it's just a joke, because I think it's so cynical and irrelevant."
22,2,"We do not know if a mask is an effective way to stop HIV. If it is, it is a joke. The CDC is trying to make a prank that says: 'I don't know if this is a joke, and the NSA is trying to make a joke.'The CDC is trying to influence policy makers, and if the President is being a dick, I think the ACA is a joke."
55,2,>I don't see what the real answer is the US government.
64,2,CANNOTANSWER: I am not against ACA mandates cuz they ruin the economy get people fired and people should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force.
74,2,Isn't the 'the only thing they aren't pranksters is their mouths. They've told us to not suck it up because they think they're insufferable and it isn't fair for the people to get infected. It isn't a joke because they think they're insufferable and it's not fair for the people to get infected. It isn't just a joke because they don't understand what a prank is.
75,2,"""Cannot be wrong, it's too bad to not wear a mask as well. There is no need to do it, and I don't want people getting vaccinated if they're not vaccinated. I know it's not that hard to get sick but I need to go in and sabotage the virus. I just want to go, I don't like this or any of the other examples, but I don't think I'll ever be able to help you."

82,2,"A lot of things are going to go wrong. It is not a'solution' to the ACA, or is it a good idea?"
84,2,"I think it is a good joke to point out that the president is trying to stop the spread of AIDS, and not a prank. It is a joke, I'm just joking."
85,2,"It's not a joke, it's an example of a joke. I think the issue is that the president is trying to prevent the spread of AIDS in a ""real"" country. I'm really sorry the article did not mention this."
88,2,"In this case, the CDC and CDC are just being 'incompetent' and it's clearly the CDC that is misinterpreting the message of the message."
90,2,CANNOTANSWER is just a fucking dumbo
93,2,"""What does the president want to stop?"""
100,2,The story of this guy is really good. He's got a problem. He's not in any other way doing a good job or even doing anything for the community.
2,1,"There's nothing wrong with the Obama administration being a joke, but if you think that's what they're talking about. The Obama administration was a joke, not just a prank about the Obama Administration. The ACA was an important, well-considered policy, but I don't think they're that crazy."
16,2,"The CDC and the CDC are going to make people look like trolls. If the president is a racist, he will likely stop saying that."
17,2,"You have a good point, but this is a joke. Putting on a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of a virus. Please wear a mask."
21,2,... and the other half of the paragraph isn't true. I would think that the joke would have been a great way to yank his name out of the headline.
22,2,Vaccination is not a joke.
55,2,"'Pause it's not a joke'' is a joke, is it? 'I don't see what the real answer is the US government''."
64,2,The Obama effect is not a joke. It is a joke. It is a joke.
74,2,Why would you want to be a doctor?
75,2,What do you think of the ACA as?
80,2,I'm going to go rewatch this.
82,2,>I'm very happy that there is a problem with the ACA.
84,2,I don't know the whole situation.

16,2,Then people will start blaming their elected officials for not understanding a word - 'trick-on-the-mouse' or'symbol'.
17,2,Well it's not a joke if they're trying to get people to wear a mask.
21,2,This is going to be a pretty terrible article.
22,2,"You can't stop yourself from being sick at work without the mask, you can't stop the people from getting sick from a hat, you can't stop the people from getting sick from a hat. You can't stop people from getting sick from a hat, you can't stop people from getting sick from a hat, you can't stop people from getting sick from a hat."

22,2,"It's a joke in its most basic sense: people who do not know how to play, but are vaccinated, should be vaccinated, the CDC should be vaccinated. It sounds like you're being sarcastic, but i don't know what it means to be a racist, racist, sexist, racist, sexist, sexist, racist - a bad joke and an effective way of stopping the spread of a virus. Is it an example of the CDC to make the AMA as a joke"
55,2,"""You can wear your mask at all times, no matter what the government does."""
64,2,"It's a joke because it says 'I don't think you are a joke, but I do want to know why people wear a mask to stop people from walking and then taking off it when they get to my table?"""
74,2,"I think the first sentence is pretty apt, like:"
75,2,"So, you're the person blaming the government?"
80,2,"... ne'er. But, I just realized that the entire NSA shit is coming up."
82,2,"I would like to have a spit-on moment in a discussion of how they're getting anti-ACA in Australian politics. I would want to see if they will try to fix it before the repeal, and if not, what do you think about it?"
84,2,"There's some good facts here. If the president hasn't fought the AIDS epidemic, then he's not a prankster."
85,2,Vaccination is an example of a joke.
88,2,The CDC was trying to stop the spread of a virus by giving the government a mandate to not vaccinate. It was the wrong decision and they're not getting to say what they're saying.
90,2,"It's called ""Potential Prank"". The author does not actually believe in such a thing. It's about ""pranks"" he's trying to make, not ""pranks"" but ""pranks"" of people to get a deal with Obama's policies."

2,1,No. The article is a joke. I didn't say it was a joke. I said it was a joke. It's a joke. But the president did have a right to not say it.
16,2,"The joke isn't funny, it's just a statement. The person is being lied to about. The person isn't on a horseback ride to get the vaccine, and it is a hat. That's what he's saying."""
17,2,"You're gonna have to say it's a joke. The CDC needs to know that a virus can be vaccinated, because a person who's not immune is not immune."
21,2,"OP, OP wants you to tell him:"
22,2,Vaccination is actually an effective way to stop the spread of HIV
55,2,It sounds like a joke.
64,2,"The president doesn't have to be vaccinated. It's a joke. The ACA repeal is a joke, which is what the ACA repeal is for."
74,2,It is a joke if it is not a prank.
75,2,"I'm very happy to hear this, as I'm a medical student and have no excuse for not wearing a mask."
80,2,It seems the NSA is going to act like a fucking idiot.
82,2,"It’s hard to see how the author thinks about this, but the author of this article is correct. The ACA is one of the most threatening things in the United States. It’s not an anti-abortion act."
84,2,">In my opinion, wearing a mask when I get sick and if I do, I will resign."
85,2,"Obama is essentially a scumbag and has no real problem being a troll. His comment was aimed at the public but isn't a joke. He's trying to slander Obama by using words like ""shame"" and ""right"" to be a joke, which isn't a joke at all."
88,2,Yes... Vaccines aren't health issues. They are not health issues. They are not health issues. They are not health issues. They are not health issues. They are not health issues. They are not health issues.

2,1,I’m a doctor. We got a job and a child and the government blew the bomb.
16,2,"I'm sorry you need to be so cautious. I am a huge supporter of the government and the current administration. It is not a joke, it is a prank."
17,2,"A few things. I mean, I'm a big fan of the CDC and I like the idea of putting on a mask to prevent HIV and the likes. I also like the idea of a hat, but the fact that it isn't an effective way to prevent the spread of the virus is something that should have been made pretty explicit a long time ago."
21,2,A funny bit of a joke I think it was in the movie 'Mossy'.
22,2,Are there any facts on this?
55,2,I am so sad to see people continue the vicious cycle of hate and disdain for people who aren’t on top of the topic.

80,2,"The president has made a lot of money from the NSA's NSA surveillance programs, and I'd like to think that they are doing more good than they should be, to stop the spread of AIDS. The NSA is essentially giving free medical research to those who don't want to get sick."
82,2,"the best answer to the question that was asked is if you're anti-abortion, and are more anti-abortion. if you're anti-abortion, and you're anti-abortion, then that's not a good answer."
84,2,I'm going to look up the underlying concept. There's not any 'hoverman' like that. There's also nothing to do with having a mask on. The whole point is putting on a mask is a joke.
85,2,Vaccination is also a joke that the president doesn't even have a hat. The president didn't even say anything when he asked people to wear a hat.

90,2,This has been mentioned by an unemployed lady for 6 months. I think she's a big part of the conversation and is on the 'what's really going on?' segment. Basically I've only heard that a couple of times.
93,2,You are absolutely right that there is no way the president can't stop it from happening. You need to step up to a higher level and go on the run and get back on the top.
100,2,"""If you aren't a good guy, then this is not the right place to start. I am sorry that you have to go through this."""
2,1,I don’t see any point in taking your words as serious.
16,2,"Yoko Ono is the president, not the president. He is the president of the United States. The president is the President."
17,2,That's a joke.
21,2,What a waste of time. I think the ACA is actually a joke in itself.
22,2,"""I don't know if this is a joke, and the NSA is trying to make a joke about it."""
55,2,The CDC is doing it for a reason. It is a joke to make the people who aren't on top of the topic. It is a joke.

84,2,"I'm a professor in an AMA/research fellowship. I've had people call me ""mocking"" when they come to my school to ask me to wear a mask for the entire school year. I'm a big fan of the show, but I think the message of the school is that people who have HIV, have the best chance of not being in the hospital, are likely to ask me to wear a mask for a prank. The joke was to ""Stop smoking cigarettes with my boyfriend"", and was later told that that is a joke."
85,2,"I'd say he's very careful, but I'm going to take it back to his point."
88,2,I'd be mad if the CDC had no mandates to get vaccines because there is no way to prevent the spread of a virus. I'd be sarcastic and just be stupid and make fun of the CDC.

17,2,A prank can work for any number of reasons.
21,2,>I'm so confused.
22,2,"I know that there's an AMA that has been blown out of proportion. It seems like everyone is talking about what they think they want to hear, but there are also a number of things that the AMA is really about. The AMA was meant to get people to read the headlines as well as the actual AMA. So, I'm not suggesting this is a joke because the AMA is being framed as a joke."

82,2,So you’re saying that the problem with the ACA is that the ACA prohibits the use of other medicines to prevent the spread of HIV?
84,2,"Considering how fucked up it is, it's an incredibly difficult situation to say."
85,2,"It's a joke and a joke because it is meant to be funny. The mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to stop the spread of a virus. A mask has a purpose. It's intended to protect people, and is used to prevent AIDS epidemics. The government and the government have been helping prevent this. I don't think this is a joke."
88,2,There is no denying that vaccines are a health issue. They are the best way to stop the spread of a virus. They are not health issues. They are not health issues. They are not health issues. They are not health issues. They are not health issues.
