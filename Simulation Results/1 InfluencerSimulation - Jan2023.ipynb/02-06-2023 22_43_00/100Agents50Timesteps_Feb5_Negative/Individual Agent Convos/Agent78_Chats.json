    "It's part of the measures deployed by the government to help stop the spread of a virus.",
    "[I'm just saying I'm glad I could get through this. I do not think he should wear a mask, it's just that he's wearing a mask when I'm feeling really bad. If I'm really bad I wear a mask, like, 1 4 of the time.\"",

    "AIDS and people suffering from it is not just a medical condition. It is not a very common illness. It is very rare. It is very hard to diagnose, and so the stigma that goes along with it is not a good sign. If a person is living with HIV, it is going to become a more serious disease as the illness is far more widespread. The stigmas come in all shapes and sizes. The stigmas are so widespread that they are just too much of an immature thing to say. If a person is wearing a mask, a man wearing a mask",
    "AIDS is a huge problem in the US, and most of the stigma is based on that. AIDS has spread so quickly and people will be diagnosed with it. AIDS is also very hard to diagnose, and the stigma that is built around it is a lot worse.",
    "This is my post. I'm going to throw a big man in the trash at someone for ignoring the fact that someone like him is a dick. He's been having a hard time breathing lately, and that's a very serious mental health issue.",
    "'It's a big deal'. That's why you can't blame him for his behavior.",
    "I am in love with someone who wears a mask all the time to fight cancer. He doesn't want to be associated with the person wearing a mask, so he wears a mask and is trying to help others.",
    ">Why is the man going to wear a mask if the world wants to see what it is?",
    "It sounds like the hive mind is going to get too used to the idea of having someone else to talk to about it - and that's one of the reasons the stigma exists. Getting a better doctor - is more akin to having a doctor who can't give you a better diagnosis.",
    "It's not a troll post. Why are you trying to make a defensive point? There is no way to know if someone has AIDS but the stigma attached to it.",
    "It's not a good sign that someone is wearing a mask.",
    "I am a guy with a history of HIV/AIDs who had a hard time breathing. I am a narcissist.",
    "I think that's what people are saying because the stigma doesn't necessarily stop people from wearing a mask.",
    "I don't understand what you're trying to say here. I'm just saying I don't think it's a deal breaker. I just think it's a misunderstanding, not a mental illness.",

    "I think there's a lot of stigma on the internet regarding people who have had AIDS or other health issues. The fact is, HIV/AIDS is not a mental illness, and most people will not be able to cope with the stigma as often as that shit is. But there is a bit of stigma around it and some people tend to find that less is more and more. I think it's important that people get tested and can get a better diagnosis and get treatment, or at least the stigma is that it's not the right path to go.",

    "No. The only way to tell this story is to give an accurate account of how he's feeling. Not that he's using it as an excuse for not letting his friends know that he's trying to help people with HIV, or just the fact that it's really getting a troll. He's not going to help, he's just trying to say he's trying to get people to do something they don't want to do.",
