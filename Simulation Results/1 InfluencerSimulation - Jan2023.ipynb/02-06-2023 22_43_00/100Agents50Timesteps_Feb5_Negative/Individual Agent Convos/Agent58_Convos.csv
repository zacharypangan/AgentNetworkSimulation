94,58,i wear my mask when i m in public lawmaker who isn t wearing his mask in public says
101,58,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
58,3,I see a lot of other comments on /r/DrugResistance about the mask and the lack of proper training.
58,13,"I'm not going to answer your question, but you did say you are against vacks mandates."
58,16,I think the mask is not the first step toward preventing a virus spreading... I think the one i had was actually used to prevent it and it wasn't the last. It's not as effective as having a mask.
58,20,"If they don't work, get out and talk to people about it."
58,21,i would stop trying to help those who have done the same.
58,22,In my opinion this isn't a good option.

58,26,"What about if I could play in a football team, and if they have a helmet I would wear a mask instead"
58,27,"I'm actually not a sportsman so I don't have any idea what this is about... I mean I was playing when I was a teenager, so I was still young... But I don't have a lot of experience with this."

58,36,"It doesn't work in Georgia. If it does, you will be kicked out of the game."
58,38,> Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
58,43,So do you know what kind of helmet is worn by a team?
58,52,This is one of those things you have to keep in mind. If i were president i'd have no problem at all in the future.
59,58,"Oh man you should come to Georgia to get vaccinated, you can also wear a mask to walk through public restrooms and make a noise to make sure you are breathing through a mask"
76,58,You don't have to wear a mask for an American.
77,58,They have a mask on their hands and it is soooooo contagious.
78,58,"A school in Delaware has one who can not wear a mask. If that school was an exception to the order, they cannot continue to hold the order."
80,58,Wearing a mask or getting the jab is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
84,58,A good mask. I am sure I will be wearing it for a week. It's pretty damn comfortable.
86,58,I have to go to the museum and look at this movie with my mask a couple of times to get a real sense of how strange it is.
89,58,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
94,58,You're in public lawmaker who isn't wearing his mask in public says

58,3,"> Wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops i Well, there is a lot more to it."
58,13,I don't know how many people in the world can have a mask on? And you never know what kind of helmet can get that high.
58,16,Is there anything I can do about it?
58,20,Yes. The CDC needs to make a CDC rule that they don't make mandatory wearing of masks.
58,21,"'What about if I could play in a football team, and if they have a helmet I would wear a mask instead I'm actually not a sportsman so I don't have any experience with this. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
58,22,I have never been kicked out of a game for wearing a mask. I do know the practice to do. I can wear a helmet while I'm playing and wear it for an hour.
58,25,I do not think I am a political member of the United States military.
58,26,You’re the first guy that reads the article.
58,27,"I think it was more the fact that the helmets are very difficult to take off when you're playing on a game, as you'll need to have some protection. Wearing a mask is very difficult because it doesn't necessarily have to be an absolute requirement of a physical performance. But the fact that you can't wear a mask is a big sign that you're having trouble with the system and you want to continue to work to get yourself in better shape. Obviously if you're going to wear a mask, it's going to be ineffective."
58,32,"I am a US Senator and my job requires me to wear a mask and I want to go to college so I can work on it asap. I am not an authority in the US, but I feel like I need to look up a few things. The gov't does not have a list of what to do, and I am not allowed to do what to do."
58,33,Are the coaches being treated the same as all coaches? Or are coaches treated the same as all other coaches in a situation like this?
58,34,"You're a very stupid person. If you want to learn about the virus, you need to learn how to use a mask on your hands and face. You do not even need a helmet. If you're just making fun of your job, then you don't need a helmet."
58,36,"Yes, they're supposed to protect the public from the spread of a virus. That's exactly what they say, that's why you should not wear a mask unless you're in the US."
58,38,I read the article claiming that wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
58,43,"""If I were president i'd have no problem at all in the future. Oh man you should come to Georgia to get vaccinated, you can also wear a mask to walk through public restrooms and make a noise to make sure you are breathing through a mask You don't have to wear a mask for an American. They have a mask on their hands and it is soooooo contagious."
58,52,"If he were president, he would be a troll a lot more often than not."
59,58,I hate it if the word 'dumbest' is 'hmmmmm..' But i feel like that's more like a saying than a response.
76,58,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
77,58,i have a mask on my hands and it is soooooo contagious
78,58,I don't care about the facts. I'm not going to be a doctor.
80,58,"Then, by all means, please suck a squirt of blood. I'll try to play the game but I want to leave this thread."
84,58,This doesn't sound like a very good plan for you.
86,58,> Do you know where I read that?
89,58,Putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i ve done in my entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i ve done in my entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things
94,58,I think the question is whether people who wear masks should be allowed to do this or not. That's because they don't have to.
101,58,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
58,3,"> If I were president i'd have no problem at all in the future. Oh man you should come to Georgia to get vaccinated, you can also wear a mask to walk through public restrooms and make a noise to make sure you are breathing through a mask You do not even need a helmet."
58,13,> I hate it if the word 'dumbest' is 'hmmm..' But i feel like that's more like a saying than a response.
58,16,"CANNOTANSWER](http://www.cdc.gov/pubs/publications/viroma/virus.pdf) is on the ""Dumbest"" list. I'm a US Senator. I read this article."
58,20,What I'm assuming is that the CDC has already established that wearing a mask is necessary to prevent the spread of the virus.
58,21,A guy who wore a mask to make fun of someone for being in a sports team? Nope. Not the one.
58,22,"So your job requires you to wear a mask, and if you're not an authority in the US, I can see why this could be a very dangerous thing."
58,25,"No, that's exactly what they say."
58,26,...and I don't see why the guy is taking a leap of faith and trying to make a point of why he was taking this position. And you should know that the gov't doesn't have a list of what to do.
58,27,> I'm actually not a sportsman so I don't have any idea what this is about...
58,32,I’m a professional sports coach in Colorado. I wear a helmet but the gov’t tries to prevent me from wearing the mask. They say it protects from the spread of a virus.
58,33,"I'm the same way, I don't think it's funny that you're being a very stupid person... Besides the fact that you're having trouble in the system, I think you're very stupid."
58,34,"Unless you're a good person, you should certainly be in the right at this point."
58,36,"I don't see why you should be banned from a game unless your team has a mask, it's an illegal act."
58,38,"I'm not a doctor, and I have no interest in doing things. I'd rather have a good time than being an authority than trying to figure it out, as that's where the problems lie."
58,43,I hate to be a troll but I like to get out.
58,52,"I didn't read the article. I saw the comments and it says ""I wear a mask, I just like it."" I feel like there are ways to avoid this, but I don't think that's the best way to prevent it."
59,58,"They were referring to the US government in this video, not the US government itself."
76,58,"As someone who was born in the United States and worked at a psych ward as a coach, I'd say that's not so bad."
77,58,"It's very contagious. People in the US have been vaccinated several times and have come to realize that when it comes to the spread of a virus, they haven't been vaccinated. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
78,58,"I think a lot of schools, including our public health system, are under the misconception that the government needs to have a mandate to protect children from HIV/AIDS. That is part of what makes a good public health education."
80,58,"i have an opinion on the NSA and cant say that it is a federal law, but i've heard a lot of things about the military (and the people) and the role it plays in the NSA in the CDC. that i'm a pvp cheerleader (and that i'm against them). It does seem like the NSA is doing everything for the national security."
84,58,Is this part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
86,58,I think the people who criticized the 'Section 10 of the Law of Medicine' were misinformed. They think the president is the most important figure in the world. There are many ways that masks are effective.
89,58,It's the second dumbest thing i've done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things
94,58,"I don't think that you have any idea why the NSA has such a large influence on the government, they do have something to do with it. It is also the best way to avoid spreading a disease when the lawmaker doesn't want to use the mask."
101,58,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
58,3,"> The NSA has a large influence on the government, they do have something to do with it."
58,13,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.No, that's exactly what they say."
58,16,I would be fine with it if the NSA could have been a key part in stopping the spread of a virus.
58,20,"In a lot of countries, having a public health policy of not to cover your head with a mask is a good idea, but you can't have a government policy of not putting a mask on. In your case, the CDC has a list of what they can do for you. The CDC, not the government, should not be doing that, because there is a list in the current CDC's CDC."
58,21,I'm a big fan of this because I know a lot of people who aren't actually playing the game they're being taught. Its hard to understand people who aren't on the other team in order to get some courtesy out of their teammates and go to a game they are supposedly not supposed to get.
58,22,"[I don't think it's funny that you're being a very stupid person... Besides the fact that you're having trouble in the system, I think you're very stupid."
58,25,"What makes it ""so stupid"" is that people do not think you're a politician."
58,26,"If we're doing the right thing with the NSA... and the NSA/the health services in general, there are two things you should do."
58,27,"The article suggests that the US government is doing everything for national security. It's not ""helping"" with the spread of the virus."
58,32,"You're implying that, because you aren't a professional sports coach, the NSA is doing the same thing. It's completely true that some people need to be vaccinated, but this isn't the case. This is part of the national security agenda, not the NSA."
58,33,"There are many ways that masks are effective, you just don't have the sense of the word."
58,34,"I'm a sportsman, I am not a sportsman, but I am an athlete who plays football and plays baseball."
58,36,>I wear a mask but the gov't tries to prevent me from wearing the mask.
58,38,"In my opinion the NSA is absolutely indestructible and I think that's why a bunch of people in Colorado are so afraid that anyone wearing a mask is the only way to do that. You can't do it without a mask, even in some places if you do not want it. But that's not the problem, you're not even the one who has to worry about the threat."
58,43,/r/RealityMcConsulting is a good source for a few interesting facts.
58,52,I do not understand why people think the NSA is doing everything for national security.
59,58,"The people in this sub are not allowed to vote in general, but it is their duty to choose who does not want to vote. They need to work together to improve that. If you are in the state of Georgia, it's time to stop talking to your relatives about how the government wants to help and take action to try to stop the spread of HIV."
76,58,"if you're a fan of a certain fucking virus, why should you wear a mask as well?"
77,58,What does this post say about the government and its policy?
78,58,It's a joke because the CDC is in the program.
80,58,"I don't think I'd be allowed to use a mask or get a jab, though, if there's a mask out there to prevent someone from getting sick..."
84,58,"I'm a coach and I wear a mask to keep my hands cool. But as a coach, I have to show up at work for the same reason a coach would go away when they are sick and they get sick. I wear a mask a lot."
86,58,It sounds like a simple rule of thumb for a lot of people to follow:
89,58,It's a sarcastic joke. The guy who was wearing the mask was the first to walk on it.
94,58,What does being a cop have to do with getting a man to be wearing a mask? Is he a liar?
101,58,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
58,3,">I'm a sportsman, I am not a sportsman, but I am an athlete who plays football and plays baseball."
58,13,"And because the people who are defending the NSA aren't doing this, they're saying that it's the most effective way to combat HIV. That's why they don't blatantly imply that it's a security issue."
58,16,The NSA is not good. They're good.
58,20,"I believe the only thing that would get people to vote in Georgia is for you to wear a mask. Obviously, there is no way that would work with you to prevent HIV, but that's probably not enough to stop the spread of the virus."
58,21,"Are you a real person? You are a smart person, don't you?"
58,22,> I wear a mask but the gov't tries to prevent me from wearing the mask.
58,25,>I wear a mask but the gov't tries to prevent me from wearing the mask.
58,26,"I work with the NSA, which is why we have people with the NSA."
58,27,"This is not a bad thing, but I would like to add that it is more difficult than what most people would consider to be a safety issue."
58,32,"The article suggests that the US government is doing everything for national security. It's not ""helping"" with the spread of the virus."
58,33,I think it's really silly to say this is a non-Standard thing. You can't help but get vaccinated.
58,34,"I don't know what to say but this thread is very clear. The post doesn't say anything, it says something about how it's been used by people with an opinion about how the NSA is acting. It's more about what they're saying about being a prick than anything."
58,36,I don't know why people think the NSA is doing everything for national security. I just think that there are ways to help the spread of the virus.
58,38,Those two are exactly how you're going to find out the truth.
58,43,I'm sorry I can't do this for you.
58,52,I wear a mask and the police and health care govt can't go to work to keep you safe. There is a reason to wear a mask in some countries and some are doing something to make it less noticeable. But that's the problem and that's the problem with the govt.
59,58,"Are you aware of the fact that the CDC isn't funding vaccines in Georgia? What they can and can't tell you is what is happening. You aren't a member of the government so it's a little strange that a CDC official wouldn't want to support people allergic to HIV with a vaccine, so why does it matter if they're funding the vaccines for those who aren't? Those people are allergic to HIV."
76,58,"As a member of the military, I have not seen anyone wearing a mask."
77,58,"What's really bothering me is that the entire country's health system is not equipped to handle it, and the government isn't even in charge of it, so what is keeping you there unless the government decides to do something about it?"
78,58,"When you get sick, you have to wear a mask. This is a lot of work in the ACA. The CDC is involved in the CDC's program for public health. It is not a joke."
80,58,"This is not something the NSA is doing, and isn't something that should be allowed."
84,58,The guy is saying it because he can't really fight the flu. They're going to stop them. Unless they just go out and get some sick people.
86,58,This sub needs to be more informed and accessible so that the OP doesn't need to worry about how much of a petty shit this is.
89,58,"Then what is the difference between walking on a mask and going through a restaraunt? It's a joke, a good joke, and a sarcastic joke."
94,58,"[[Section 10](http://www.ipc.gov/repair/repair/security/complaints/nasa_repair_repair_lawyers-female_gov/). It says a man in a hood is wearing a mask, which is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
101,58,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
58,3,i am a military guy.
58,13,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
58,16,"There isn't a tyrannosis in the US. Its more about why the government is acting in such a way that it is not on the ""Dumbest"" list."
58,20,">I wear a mask but the gov't tries to prevent me from wearing the mask. I work with the NSA, which is why we have people with the NSA."
58,21,">I wear a mask but the gov't tries to prevent me from wearing the mask. I work with the NSA, which is why we have people with the NSA. This is not a bad thing, but I would like to add that it is more difficult than what most people would consider to be a safety issue. The article suggests that the US government is doing everything for national security. It's not helping with the spread of a virus."
58,22,"I'm going to stop by and say, ""I'm sorry I can't do this for you. I wear a mask and the police and health care govt can't go to work to keep you safe. I don't think it's funny that you're being a very stupid person..."
58,25,"... and the government isn't in charge of it, they are in charge of the problem. This isn't a joke, it's a good joke."
58,26,"I don't think it's unreasonable to say it's the most dangerous thing in the world. That was just another way to be funny and it should have been reported immediately. You are obviously getting away from this, op."
58,27,So what the OP just said is that his own opinion is invalid despite the fact that he's a member of the NSA. That's just ridiculous if you don't have any good reason to believe this.
58,32,"The problem is that some people need to be vaccinated, because if they don't get a vaccine they're not going to be able to have a conversation about it without telling the general public."
58,33,"The article suggests that the US government is doing everything for national security. It's not ""helping"" with the spread of the virus."
58,34,Until you hear the full version of the article you're probably not a prick.
58,36,A doctor at the IPC is saying that the only thing that can prevent a person from getting sick with a vaccine is a mask.
58,38,"IANAL, but what did it say?"
58,43,"I have never been in a state where the CDC was funded by the NSA. My parents were. I was a medical assistant. I grew up in a country where the CDC could not properly monitor me, I got sick and I was a cdc officer."
58,52,"> When you get sick, you have to wear a mask, which is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
59,58,Is it really that hard to know about a person who is allergic to a virus?
76,58,What about getting your head shaved so you can look more healthy with your facial hair?
77,58,The article makes a pretty obvious statement. It states that this is a symptom of a public health problem.
78,58,I just wanted to point out that I'm the person who has the largest public health population in the world. I didn't want to put myself in a situation where I'd have a problem with someone not wearing a mask or anything that would put me in a worse place. I don't even have a problem with the fact that the public health system's job in DE isn't to fight the disease.
80,58,"I would like to add that a video game that is a mask in an emergency situation and that someone is injured in a crash is considered a crime, and is allowed to play without a mask if it carries a virus that is the name of an illness in your body. If you need a mask, the answer to this question is... the same thing. You should read the whole post."
84,58,"You're so right, he needs a restraining order."
86,58,I don't think people will ever get sick from wearing a mask.
89,58,Putting on a mask is one of the dumbest things things i've ever done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i've done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask is one of the dumbest things i '
94,58,It's a matter of understanding the current state of the medical sector.

58,3,It is a matter of understanding the current state of the medical sector. Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
58,13,"So, I'm going to say: I don't know how many people can have a helmet on? And you never know what kind of helmet can get that high. I'm sure a lot of people wouldn't realize that helmets and masks are used to contaminate a person's blood vessels. I've read somewhere that helmets and masks are used to control the spread of the AIDS virus. It is the only way to prevent that because the AIDS virus could be spread as quickly as a virus in a game and I don't know why the"

58,21,a doctor at the IPC is saying that the only thing that can prevent a person from getting sick with a vaccine is a mask. Is it really that hard to know about a person who is allergic to a virus? What about getting your head shaved so you can look more healthy with your facial hair?

58,25,>I'm a big help and they really need to work with people.
58,26,I think the ACA is being a joke? They're going to hurt our economy and society. They're going to hurt theirs.
58,27,The article is not about the ACA. It is about the ACA itself.
58,32,This is so bizarre! I've never read it.
58,33,[The best way to stop the spread of the virus. Please wear masks.
58,34,">I don't think it's necessary to be a troll and therefore not an opportunist to go out on a limb and not actually read it."""
58,36,The whole of that ACA is so awful. I would think it would have caused a lot more problems than what it already has. There's a good reason to be concerned about not following through on any of this.
58,38,So he says it's not a joke and that's why the NSA is using it.
58,43,I think the ACA is the best way to stop this. I don't think it's a joke. It's a joke.

I don't understand why they're gonna say that, but the entire NSA's work is actually pretty much complete crap. It's all about it not preventing the spread of a virus."
76,58,It sounds like someone who has actually shaved their head and doesn't like wearing a mask doesn't think it's a good idea.
77,58,They are being a shitjob.
78,58,"I read the first sentence on the first sentence that the ""ACA"" is a joke, and the second was a naivete. The joke has nothing to do with the ACA itself. The ACA is a joke."
80,58,People are supposed to be immune to the government's threats. It doesn't. It's illegal to be a scumbag and make the government stop them.
84,58,"I'm the president of the world. They're just trying to get the Obama administration to put in place a way to prevent HIV transmission, and the Bush administration isn't trying to change his mind about it."

94,58,I have no idea what that means.

58,3,What does a mask have to do with the ACA? What does it mean?
58,13,"In the CDC, AIDS has been found to be an infection. And you are also supposed to be protected from infection."
58,16,"I have no idea what that is, but that is just what the article says. I was just trying to explain what they were trying to get."
58,20,"The ACA is an awful joke, so you have to start somewhere."

59,58,"If you're allergic to a virus, you can also wear a mask in the ER. It's not the only way to stop the spread of the virus."
76,58,The Obama presidency was pretty much a statement about preventing the spread of a deadly disease in the world.
77,58,"This is the main topic I was able to find and get the hang of. Honestly, I just don't know."
78,58,Unless you're really bad at the joke. You don't have to wear a mask to fight the flu.
80,58,"It's legal to wear a mask without a helmet, but it is not a criminal offense. They use the device to prevent a TB and then if it has an virus in it it isn't illegal."
84,58,"I don't think they have a very good plan to stop the spread of AIDS. I think they are trying to get the administration to get it, but they're trying to do it with a specific premise and purpose."
86,58,"I think the problem with a mask is the people wearing it don't actually know how to walk because they think it's bad. The issue is not the disease itself, or the person in it."
89,58,You're not going to get to be a comedian. You will only be a funny one.
94,58,I would not want to be the NSA. I wouldn't want to be the NSA. I wouldn't want to be the CIA.
101,58,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
58,3,"A man gets the ACA, his life saver and has been cured by the ACA. He has been the CDC's CDC's health advocate. His health care provider has been very concerned about preventing the spread of the disease. He has stayed in a hospital since 2010. He has resigned from his position as a Health Prosecutor and has been a member of Congress for three years. He still refuses to help prevent any more illness than he would otherwise be able to prevent. His job is still a job."
58,13,"If the helmet is in place, and the people wearing it are in danger, then I'd get my foot in the water"
58,16,"I don't think that the ""Fast Pitch a Mask"" thing would make a lot of sense, at least not in a sense that it is. It's a joke."
58,20,And this is the ACA? I mean. You're kidding. You're trying to get the government to do something that isn't a joke.
58,21,"[This is a joke. The article suggests that the US government is doing everything for national security. It's not helping with the spread of a virus. The article is about ACA, not the ACA. It is about the ACA itself."
58,22,"I'm a coach, he's a coach. The job is to help the people in the field alot, and I don't know what it's like to do a game without a mask. It's not like I don't need a mask in order to get to the place. I work as a full time coach and I've seen this before and I've even heard people say to me that I'm a liar and have been a coach. The other thing to keep in mind is how this is a joke"
58,25,You're doing what you like. You're a professional therapist.
58,26,>I love coaching however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops.

58,32,"> I do not have a list of what to do, and I am not allowed to do what to do."
58,33,"So what did we say about ""The best way to stop the spread of the virus. Please wear masks.""?"
58,34,"I think there is a bigger problem with a mask in the U.S. than just the ACA, because the health care bill would not have worked at all without it."
58,36,It's a joke.
58,38,i think this is a good way to tell you that the ACA is actually being a joke.
58,43,It is one of the reasons why people wear masks.
58,52,So the entire thing is pretty much crap.
59,58,">If I was in the US, it's time to stop talking to your relatives about how the government wants to help and take action to try to stop the spread of a virus."
76,58,"I think what you have just said is totally incorrect. I mean it's just a generalized stereotype, but it's just a general idea of how someone is going to feel and feel. The only way it'll make you feel is if they're uncomfortable with it and it doesn't work in that way."
77,58,"I don't understand the whole ""fucking troll"" part. But a lot of the humor, such as his comments in his book, is nihilism. It isn't going to end well. If the people were all in the same room, the country wouldn't be as bad. I would not be in that position to consider that the ACA doesn't get passed, because it isn't going to end well."
78,58,"I mean, what are the chances the ACA is a joke?"
80,58,"I agree with the other replies. I mean the NSA doesn't care if it doesn't stop you from getting sick, but it's doing something right."
84,58,It's the president's job to go after players with a 'vaccine' before the epidemic gets started. That is why it is important to be able to take care of them with a mask.
86,58,"(http://www.the-president.gov/failure/failure/protest/paa/Pete-to-be-like-a baby, but without an epidural)."
89,58,It's a sarcastic joke. I think it's a good idea.
94,58,In most cases it is more likely to have to do with the government's work and not the NSA's. It's a very common case that some people can't handle their work. But there's a lot of things that are 'not' about the NSA.
101,58,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
58,3,"The only reason you are in that position is because you're at the top of the list. The only way you have to stop a joke is to do the ACA right, as the health care system isn't doing the same."
58,13,"> The article suggests that the US government is doing everything for national security. It's not ""helping"" with the spread of the virus."
58,16,">You aren't being sarcastic. You're putting words wrong."""
58,20,You don't know what this guy is.
58,21,>A guy who wore a mask to make fun of someone for being in a sports team? Nope. Not the one. I'm a big fan of this because I know a lot of people who aren't actually playing the game they're being taught. Its hard to understand people who aren't actually playing the game they're being taught. Its hard to understand people who aren't actually playing the game they're being taught. Its hard to understand people who aren't actually playing the game they're being taught.
58,22,Isn't it funny that the NSA is trying to use the mask to help the country stop the spread of the virus?
58,25,It's actually about the ACA and not the ACA itself.
58,26,We need to stop using the ACA as an excuse for the epidemic. The ACA is going to hurt our economy and society. They're going to hurt theirs.
58,27,I'm not a professional therapist.
58,32,"... 'The problem is that some people need to be vaccinated, because if they don't get a vaccine they're not going to be able to have a conversation about it without telling the general public.''"
58,33,I am not sure what the joke is. Its about how the ACA can help the nation in the long run.
58,34,"This is what happened to our national security system. They are in a very large, unproven, infected area. The US government is doing this."
58,36,"""I am sick of it, but I want to wear my mask."""

58,52,i think i might be a little 'fucking troll' but i can understand that a mask is one of the ways to stop the spread of the virus.
59,58,I don't understand why the article is a joke.
76,58,"i think it's kind of a bad idea if he's trying to be a good president, if he's a dick who doesn't want the president to take a helmet off while he's on the field"
77,58,"It's about the president and the CDC trying to stop a virus from spreading through the public. I don't think anyone on this sub would believe the ACA was made for the first person in this situation, or any of the others."
78,58,The ACA has to be used to stop the spread of disease. The issue is with the stigma and not the treatment. This is a terrible joke.
80,58,[Sir] You are absolutely correct that this is not a joke.
84,58,It's a very clear point. It's the snob's job to stop AIDS because of a mask. The mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to stop the spread of a virus.
86,58,"Well, I'm not sure what the real question is: Do you have a question on this sub?"
89,58,When I was a kid I was going out on a date with my friends and I went to the bathroom. I got to my fav hat. I wear my mask and went to the bathroom a lot.

58,21,Those comments are so wrong. They make me question what the ACA is. This is going to hurt our economy and society. They're going to hurt theirs.
58,22,What is it that is wrong with you? I don't understand. I don't understand how the article is a joke. This is a joke and I don't know how to make it.
58,25,You are absolutely correct that this is not a joke. It's about how the ACA can help the nation in the long run.
58,26,"What about if I could play in a football team, and if they have a helmet I would wear a mask instead',"

58,34,The problem with putting on a mask is the lack of education.
58,36,''Making a mask in public is a way to make people more aware of the government.''
58,38,I don't see how that is a joke in any sense. The problem is that people are afraid that a CDC agent will infect people. It's one way to stop the spread of a virus.
58,43,i think the ACA is the best way to stop this. I think it's a joke.

86,58,The article says it's a prank. Putting on a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
89,58,"There are plenty of ways for people to prank people. For example, if you put on a mask you could see the guy walking out of the restaraunt and you can see the guy walking out of the restaraunt without a mask. You could see the guy walking out of the restaraunt with a mask and it wouldn't be that funny to them."

58,20,i think this is a prank
58,21,This is very disturbing. I would ask the president why he was telling a prank about the ACA.
58,22,The CDC is also trying to use the mask to help the CDC prevent the spread of HIV. The article says it's a prank and isn't a joke.
58,25,"And you know what I mean, he's just playing a dick. I mean you've never seen an epidural with a mask if you are not a doctor."
58,26,I don't think the ACA is going to stop AIDS. I think it's going to hurt the economy and society. They're going to hurt theirs.
58,27,> The article is about the US government. It's not about the ACA. It's about the ACA itself.
58,32,Is it a joke?

89,58,I don't think a prank is a prank.

101,58,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.

58,22,I don't think it's funny to make jokes about something you don't know how to make a joke about because the article said it was funny.
58,25,"The CDC is going to censor the game and take away a lot of valuable information that is not needed for ACA adherence and in some places, it is going to hurt the economy and society."
58,26,What would have happened to him and what would have happened to him?
58,27,You know it's not funny?
58,32,"It's like saying ""I've seen a movie with my mask and I'm a great president""."

58,52,"...The problem is not what we can do, it is what the government is doing to help."
59,58,The entire ACA is a joke. It's not about preventing the spread of a virus.
76,58,It's the presidents responsibility to protect themselves and his team.
77,58,That's not how this is going to turn out. The person claiming to be a troll is probably a troll.
78,58,"A little too late for me, as someone who's had to wear a mask for a while, but I'm pretty sure that's all there is to it."
80,58,sarcasm isn't a valid argument.
84,58,There's a lot to the entire article. The pranks aplenty. It sounds like the CDC is trying to make it so that people can have it on a patient. They're teasing the public.
86,58,What's the point of a mask?
89,58,Putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i've done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask.

58,13,The article cites the ACA as a scumbag attempt to make the government aware of its 'program' to reduce AIDS transmission.
58,16,"You do know that the CDC, but not the CDC — are they doing something like this and not trying to stop the spread of a virus?"
58,20,"I'm really just going to go on a rant about how the president is a troll, a troll, a prankster, and a prankster. The president is doing something he's not doing and his job is to prevent it. It's the government's job to help the people. If they want to do something they need to do. They need to protect themselves and their patients. I'm going to stop and think that's what he does."
58,21,It's an anti-fascist prank. You're in for a big surprise.
58,22,I would never put on a mask or not. If you have a mask on then it should have some kind of protective function.
58,25,It sounds like the US government is trying to stop the spread of the virus.
58,26,i know the jokes. but it is a joke. and i know there are a lot more to it. i believe that the ACA is going to hurt the economy and society. It is going to hurt our economy and society.
58,27,"Unless there is a law that prohibits it and you can use your helmet as a warning and insure the integrity of your own workplace, you're not a joke. The issue here is that the ACA and the CDC do not rely on you to help prevent the spread of the virus - they only care if it's not a prank."

58,38,"I'm so sorry, but I read the NSA article for a while. I think it would be worth taking a deep breath to understand the context of what the article said and why they are trying to cut down on it. There is no way in hell they are going to let you take that one."
58,43,"The CDC will censor the game to stop the spread of AIDS and make it so there's nothing to say about him getting sick, being a doctor and a medical assistant."
58,52,"You've seen the movie I just watched with a mask, and a doctor doesn't think you're in the wrong."
59,58,Vaccines are not health issues. The issue with the ACA is the lack of a proper protection.
76,58,"In other words, 'The problem with a mask is people who wear it, and they don't have any idea what a prank is, especially when people wear it."
