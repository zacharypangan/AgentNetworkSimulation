34,26,I do not think the problem is that you can't wear a mask properly under a helmet.

34,33,"See how crazy trump's making America is here. I know this is a troll post, but I think it's hilarious because you are one of the few people that actually actually wear a mask.

61,34,"Why do people think you are gullible and submissive? Is it just to say that, no one wants to hear that."
63,34,"I was just a student at my senior year of university when i was a student. It seemed to me like I had more of a problem with the mask, so I wore it all the time."
75,34,"I just did an AMA and I was really baffled by the fact that I can not wear a mask, the people that are not in the country are making a point of it being illegal. It sounds like there are so many things that would be considered illegal to use a mask."

34,17,"I can relate to your concern. I feel like some people would just want to make this clear. I was just a student. I wasn't a troll, but I had a hard time believing that a mask was just not in the uniform that the president needed to wear. I was still a student. I was a student."
34,18,"The most outrageous thing I can say is that you don't have to be wearing a mask to work properly, you need to be wearing the proper gear, and it's not your responsibility."
34,20,"I can't imagine that being a man of my word does not help him because of his mentality, but because of the fact that he doesn't wear a mask."
34,26,"I’m a man of my word, but i can also see that he didn’t do this at the game."
34,27,"People have been wearing it for a lot of years, and most people don't understand that it is illegal. I would be surprised if this happened and some other news outlets just do. I know this is funny because i think it's because people are making fun of that because of how crazy they are. It's like they are all doing something ridiculous, and people have to be completely mad that someone is wearing a mask because they don't have to."
34,29,"I think that the 'right to safety' thing isn't a good way to explain that a mask does suck, but it makes a lot of sense when it comes to health."
34,33,Because the president is not going to change his behavior by allowing the people to speak about their lives. There's no way that a virologist will actually know what a virologist is.

75,34,This is a great thing to read.
81,34,Its not a'mask'. It is a 'handle'. It is a tool to prevent the spread of a virus.
88,34,"In my opinion, you don't need the masks to protect yourself. Your mask does not prevent anyone from getting sick. Vaccinated, not vaccinated. I wouldn't go to a TB and STIs event without the masks."
95,34,"What movie is this? Because if you read the title you will see that a person has been forced to wear a mask to protect themselves. It is a part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. It was supposed to help in preventing the spread of a virus.

34,18,"The point is, I am not a fan of football at all. I do not care if I get vaccines for my TB or STI's because they have no chance of me getting a vaccine."

34,27,I want to read that 
34,29,"They want to say, “When a president dies in the absence of a mask, they don’t have to protect themselves. They have to be vaccinated.” Obviously, the other rules are not to prevent the spread of a virus and that they should have a safety camera in case someone is hit by a floppy disk or another floppy disk. I think if you are in a position to take control of a floppy disk and do that without one, you can be vaccination. You should be okay if you aren’"
34,33,I don't think this is a very good description of the article. It's basically saying that the President didn't wear a mask to prevent the spread of the virus. It's an extremely poor way to describe the president and the health state of his presidency.
35,34,"I think this is a cliche. But people can be raped and killed by the government, and if someone else has no say it's a cliche that they're doing it they're trying to justify the raped, but what they want is to get them into the public eye to get the vaccine that they need."
45,34,"> What is a mask? It's for the defense, not the coach. I want to go to the Olympics, but I don't want to go to the Olympics unless I am on the roster. I want to go to the Olympics in my spare time, and I don't want to do anything."
58,34,"Unless you're a good person, you should certainly be in the right at this point."
61,34,You are being disrespectful and that's just not the way to do it. A lot of people think wearing a mask is the best way to stop the spread of a virus.
63,34,[this is part of a different sub for all of us. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
75,34,I don't really think they have any specific mandates on that - just that you can't wear a mask.
81,34,"I'm pretty sure that'masking' someone doesn't do anything wrong unless they are able to get the job done. That's not even a ""mask"" as a joke. That being said, it's kind of silly for us to do it if we have to be told. If you wear a mask while being told it's a ""handle"" for the job then the job will probably be done. If you don't know the exact definition of a mask, you could probably say a bit like ""I don't know what"

95,34,There are tons of videos from the movie in the movie. Its a fun one and I love it.
97,34,"It's possible that this kind of behavior is because of the lack of protective clothing. In general, the coach hasn't had a proper helmet on since 2005, and if a team's defender hasn't had a proper helmet, that's a bit off."

34,20,I think that's a very good explanation of the problem.
34,26,"They don't wear a mask. They use the helmet to prevent a virus spread and that's a problem. They don't use the mask to prevent an illness, so it's the problem. I think the reason it's a problem is because they can't get anyone to use the mask."
34,27,"I figured that when someone did it, they would take care of it themselves and not have to wear a mask."
34,29,Is it possible the floppy disk was floppy by an unintentional floppy?

35,34,It doesn't matter what the law is: you will get a mask.
45,34,Vaccination Act is the most important thing of all to be taken into consideration. Do you have a job? You don't have to wear a mask for an American.

45,34,It was a funny and logical joke. Vaccination is not a joke. It's part of a government policy. It's also an attempt at preventing a population from being at a con. The mask is the only thing that makes it comfortable. I think it's really just a joke. It's about the people who have problems.
58,34,The problem with putting on a mask is the lack of education. This is a very large problem that the US government is allowing.
61,34,"I don't think you should be calling your coach ""a delusional dick"""
63,34,"If it was my job, I'd be able to get an ambulance to the scene where the syringe happened and the other person wouldn't have a chance to go back to the restaraunt."
75,34,They have a good job at identifying what's wrong and who's not. I wouldn't do that if my husband didn't vaccinate me.
81,34,It's kind of silly to do it if you have to be told. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.You guys are so stupid. They need to be put down. Then go to jail.

97,34,"So the article is supposed to be about a man being a good coach, and the president being a great coach? That's a big, a fucking troll."
34,17,[CNN has a great piece about this. It sounds like you're on the wrong side of the issue. Why do you think that there's a problem with the CDC? It sounds like they're doing everything for national security.
34,18,"OP's name sounds like ""dang, I'm not a president yet"""
34,20,"I think if someone wears a mask and dies, it is going to cost more than a mask. That's a lot of money for a mask that is just a symptom of the AIDS epidemic, and not something the administration should have to fight."
34,26,">The problem is not if someone gets a mask, but if the medical staff is trying to do it or if they get no assistance, or if they get no assistance, or if they get no assistance, or if they get no assistance, or if they can't get vaccinated, then you're being stupid. You're just a prick."
34,27,"""I'm a man of my word covid"""
34,29,I'm a little skeptical of the whole 'What's wrong with the word mask' thing.
34,33,I'm so sorry that the article wasn't written in the correct way.
35,34,"... I don't think the guy is taking the blame, but I'd like him to do what he wants."
45,34,It's a joke that is in the military.
58,34,The question is: who is the first person to think a mask should stop the spread of the virus?
61,34,The fact that he is wearing a mask is a huge red flag.
63,34,A lot of people are wrong. I think there's a lot of truth to the story. The movie is about an inability to understand where the virus has been spread. People have to realize the danger and they should see that the masks are being used to keep people from seeing them.
75,34,I'm in a coma so I can't know what's going on. Hopefully the ACA will end it.
81,34,I think the actual question you ask is: Are you arguing that the president is an opportunistic dictator?
88,34,"Is that actually the first time that you've seen this? Because I don't like the ""why isn't it? "" part of that."
95,34,"I've seen that one, too. I feel bad for the guy. But I can't stand the guy that is the guy."
97,34,"I'm not the kind of person to actually say it, but I think that's a good sign."
34,17,The article was about a guy who's getting a virus. He's trying to stop it. He's a president. If he doesn't get it he should leave.
34,18,"I don't care who you are, but the president isn't going to take any responsibility for making you look horrible."
34,20,"A lot of people aren't even aware of the problem that he's indoctrinating, it sounds like he's indoctrinating us."
34,26,Why don't you think wearing a mask is a problem? It's a problem because the government is not trying to stop the spread of AIDS.
34,27,What's the problem with the word mask?
34,29,"I think it is quite common for the CDC to prescribe a mask on players for the purpose of keeping them from catching the virus and helping them get in sick, but they can also prescribe a mask for other players as part of a preventative care. It's just a different way of putting the message across."
34,33,You're trying to portray someone as a devious person that does not understand why people have to wear a mask? It doesn't look like they do.
35,34,I think that he does a good job of improving the patient experience.
45,34,It's really funny that it's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
58,34,"I don't think a mask is a good idea unless you're in a situation that you can't tolerate, and I know a lot of people who do."
61,34,"It's not a ""smoking on my mask"" thing. It's a very real and serious thing."
63,34,"I think a good way to explain it is putting on a mask because the ""dumb part of the problem"" is an understatement of a common misconception. It's a prank."
75,34,I'm glad that people have found some useful info for this discussion.
81,34,And then get a new job. That's a sexist joke a lot of people are arguing.
88,34,"If you have a virus, don't get the AIDS vaccine. The virus can get through your nose, which can have a fatality rate of up to 4 million. A virus can be a virus from an infectious disease, which is not a virus that can spread through your nose."
95,34,"It's one of the best in the book. It is a fun one and I love it.'', 'There are tons of videos from the movie in the movie. Its a fun one and I love it.'', 'The movie is fun but a bit wacky.', '""In order to help prevent the spread of a virus, a man is asked to wear a mask to protect himself"", 'It is fun but a bit wacky.'"
97,34,Those are not the words you will hear in a coach's head.
34,17,Is the CDC a sexist and evil corporation?
34,18,My first thought was that there is a lot of misunderstanding behind this one. That you're being sarcastic?
34,20,">A lot of people aren't even aware of the problem that he's indoctrinating, it sounds like he's indoctrinating us."
34,26,"And there are so many things in there to do that you are not sure whether or not it's appropriate. But unless the government was working on a better way to prevent the spread of AIDS, the sexist side of things is what is needed."
34,27,The movie is funny and wacky. It's a good one and I love it.
34,29,"""The truth is that many people get sick and aren't doing enough to get the virus out. They need to get them out, and if they're not taking precautions to protect themselves, they're being lazy."""
34,33,A lot of people aren't trolls.
35,34,"The CDC has been doing very well. I think the CDC will be doing good and the CDC will be getting rid of the raped and killed part, which is a huge mistake."
45,34,It is a joke. It was a joke.
58,34,Isn't the US government doing things for national security? Because that's what we're talking about.
61,34,"I was an attorney and was a doctor on a team in which the team had a senile virus. I've been to several sports in the USA and the best coach I've ever worked for is a big, bad, and highly respected one who isn't very nice. That's a great point and the CDC is great at telling you about what it does."
63,34,"I think it's a good way to explain it because the ""dumb part of the problem"" is an understatement of a common misconception. It's a prank. The idea of ""... I've done a lot of dumb things with my mask. I've done a lot of dumb things with my mask and it's been a huge sneeze after it. I'm really a little bit sad that I got a full mask. I want my players to get in the game, so I'm not a prank"
75,34,... Is it illegal to wear a mask for a drug? I'm sure your mother would love that.
81,34,I know that the guy you linked to isn't a liberal. But his point is sexist. That sexist is a terrible notion of a political party. It is not a moral thing. I don't believe this is true.

34,17,The thing that makes this movie really interesting is the fact that people think the CDC is bad at trying to do things for national security and not the AIDS virus.
34,18,">The most outrageous thing I can say is that you don't have to be wearing a mask to work properly, you need to be wearing the proper gear, and it's not your responsibility.''"
34,20,The mask is the thing the US government is supposed to be working on. There's no reason why the government can't just use it to stop the spread of the disease.
34,26,"It’s a funny fact. The president is a prick, and a prick for not wearing his mask and going to play football for the team."
34,27,"I've had the experience that if we wore a mask, we would be in the hospital on a few occasions. If there was a significant change, I'd put on a mask and take a sand paper towel. When I'm on the ball, I don't wear a mask, it gets on my back, and it gets all slack. You have the potential for a major stroke, but you need a bigger mask."
34,29,A mask in a tv show isn't always better than a mask in a play. It's better than any mask at home.
34,33,"I read this as ""I want to wear a mask on a girl and I want to wear it on her."", ""I hate that guy too, I don't care if he's a troll or not, but he doesn't seem to like people, and I love to have fun and play football."""
35,34,I'm also a huge fan of terrorism.
45,34,Is it really a joke? The most important thing of all to be taken into consideration.

34,20,"I can tell you that they're being very selfish and indoctrinating towards the affluent and the uninformed because of how they've treated the AIDS epidemic, but they don't understand why they're promoting them.

61,34,"I'm not sure what the CDC's definition of a joke is. I can't imagine a joke where someone is asked to get a mask or a doctor and is called ""a delusional dick"" because the CDC is trying to help protect their citizens from the diseases they are trying to prevent. It is more like saying ""If I can't do it then I need to get a doctor."" or ""I can't do it"". Or ""I can't even put a mask on my face""."

75,34,Vaccines are an incredibly important and effective tool for preventing the spread of a virus.

81,34,It was a real misunderstanding of this post. I was wondering why I was able to read it if someone was pointing out that the AIDS vaccine is a sexist joke and I was asking for the same exact thing when they said the AIDS vaccine was a sexist joke.
88,34,"I hated a movie called The Matrix when I was kid, and this was a movie that was supposed to be about kids and the kids. It is a great movie. The movie is not one of those.

75,34,I'd say the US CDC needs to learn about what's going on. They can't control how bad the virus can spread by vaccinating.
81,34,The AIDS vaccine is a sexist joke.

34,26,It sounds like if they wanted to do the vaccine he would have to make the decision.

I just couldn't understand the message. I'm sorry, I can't understand your point, I'm sorry, I can't understand your point, I'm sorry, I can't understand your point, I just didn't read it in a way that made me laugh."
58,34,"I can understand people who don't wear masks, but it's pretty much like saying you are a prick, you aren't a troll."
61,34,It is a very common joke.
63,34,/r/wisconsin/index.html
75,34,'Never a reason not to wear a mask'
81,34,You’re saying he’s wearing a mask because he’s afraid of losing his job? I think you’re being a dick?
88,34,"You have to wear a mask to fight your infection and also get the AIDS vaccine in order to get a full head of water, because you're not going to eat enough to get sick, and not enough to get sick. That's not to say you can't get vaccinated with a booster, but that's not because you don't have one."
95,34,The last of us was a really good prank movie and it is one of the best movies ever produced.
97,34,"I am an NCAA coach. I am a big fan of the team and my team, and I love watching my teammates play with me, despite all the pressure they are trying to put on my teammates. It is just my little way to show support for the team. I am proud of my team and my teammates, and I am proud that I can do my part and play well for them."
34,17,"I'm not gonna say that this was a good read, but that's a good one. I think it's a very good one, but I don't really think you're being as naive as you seem to be."
34,18,"No, the fact that he is a troll makes him look like a terrible person."
34,20,It's a really good quote.
34,26,AIDS is a serious problem and a prick.
34,27,"They are not going to stop the spread of HIV, and as a joke they will stop it from happening."
34,29,"That's why people should go with the joke, which is sexist."
34,33,"[Not a joke, but the joke is actually very funny. I've only seen some of these posts. I don't see how the mask will change a person's behavior, but it's not very helpful in describing a person's behavior with a mask, because of its value."
35,34,"I have a friend who had been vaccinated for many reasons, I couldn't care less. It's very much not about the government being a pawn. They can be obnoxious, but they can be a pawn."
45,34,"This prank isn't funny. The President has been wearing a mask for nearly two decades because of the health care system. This is a joke, and it's funny."
58,34,"I am not a doctor or a doctor so it’s very hard for me to say that unless you like the way it’s done, a mask should help the situation. I am not the CDC, but it is a large problem, so if I were a doctor and I had a full face mask I would do anything to prevent it from getting there."
61,34,CANNOTANSWER'S INJURY WAS OVER THE ASSESSMENT OF A CHILD. I love coaching however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops.
63,34,"I think the best way to respond is to say that you are not a good fit for the job, the joke is that you need to wear a mask, the mask is not a prank. You don't do any of those things and there is nothing you can do to get them to work."
75,34,I'm going to have to add you to my list.
81,34,"I want to start a video of a man who just hatted his helmet off and had to go to the bathroom to get the AIDS vaccine. I want to start a movie of the AIDS vaccine to show it's a real prank. I'm going to say that he isn't a real dick, he's just a prankster, that's all."
88,34,Why not just give them an idea?
95,34,"I read that, and now I think about it, I really hate this movie."
97,34,"The article was a jerk, and that is very much a joke, and what's interesting to me is the fact that the president is a dick."
34,17,"Honestly, this movie makes it very interesting. It's not like the article says that the president has a hat on, it says that he has one. It's not about the fucking government, but that he has a mask. It's a joke, and not about the CDC."
34,18,Is a mask part of the CDC's stance that the President must wear a mask?
34,20,I can't believe that this guy did a prank or was trying to imply he is a dick.
34,26,"It's a joke, not a prank. It's just a prank."
34,27,"It's hilarious. I want to read a satire of the fact that this is a prank and is just a joke, and it isn't the 'problem'."
34,29,The question is what would have happened if someone wasn't wearing a mask? Because it is pretty funny.
34,33,The point of the article is that the president does not have an actual problem with the AIDS vaccine and that he is just a prick. That's why people would be willing to accept the government's actions and tell a joke if they wanted to be. So he has a valid reason to not wear a mask in his ad campaign. He did not get the AIDS vaccine. The president was not obligated to wear a mask at all because he was the one with HIV.
35,34,"A friend of mine was vaccinated. He said he didn't like it because it was the most important vaccine in his life. I think he's also a snob, but he doesn't think it's a joke. The reason why you are being a snob is because he is a snob."
45,34,"""Women, I have a prank. But I don't want to have to wear a mask in the Olympics, but I don't want to go to the Olympics, and I don't want to do anything."""
58,34,CANNOTANSWER: I am not a doctor.
61,34,I'm a politician and I'm a doctor. I'm not a doctor but I can't be a doctor.
63,34,I've got a very similar question to you.
75,34,"I think that the best thing to do is to just stop hating on the government, or at least be skeptical. In addition, you can also stop hating on the government by buying a mask. That's not the worst thing you could do, and you can't change the way it's been for some time."
81,34,I didn't even think about wearing a mask to be a joke.
88,34,I don’t think this is funny. But I’m going to say it: [Dan] was being incredibly sarcastic about this.
95,34,"If you like pranks, try to avoid the reverberation of a bad phrase or a stupid word."
97,34,"I've read a couple of interesting articles on it: ""Most people with AIDS don't realize that the president has a medical condition that requires them to wear a mask, and a helmet isn't a mask.'"""
34,17,This is not a joke. It is a joke. It is a joke.
34,18,"The CDC's stance to wear a mask is based on the government in the sense of preventing the spread of HIV, and it is not based on the truth of the situation."
34,20,"Because in my opinion, wearing a mask is a joke and isn't the correct way to deal with the epidemic. The CDC is indoctrinating the AIDS epidemic. If they aren't doing that then they will be kicking them out of office. If they don't then it will be a prank."
34,26,"I have a friend that goes to the AIDS clinic to get tested for AIDS and I've learned to wear a mask. It's just a prank, not a joke."
34,27,The article suggests that a new AIDS vaccine may be available for people who are already infected with a virus. I don't know why they're going to prank on the government or tell jokes in the next couple of years.
34,29,""".I’m not a doctor. I’m a doctor."
34,33,>The article is basically saying that the president doesn't have an actual problem with the AIDS vaccine
35,34,"I think the ""apology"" in the title is a little tad misleading."
45,34,> Vaccination is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
58,34,"I'm going to ask your opinion on a few issues. One, in fact, is that I genuinely don't care about what others have to say, and what others have to say. The other is that I don't care if a person says ""I don't like this joke"" or ""I don't want to have the CDC."" The ACA does not change."
61,34,"A bunch of people who aren't even in school, like Obama, have a ""Pizza & Muffin"" and are really excited for this movie."
63,34,"It seems like the only good way to respond to that is to say ""I think that he's being a troll."""
75,34,My friend is the CDC's president. That's why he was trying to justify it by saying the government should not be ashamed of what the government is doing.
81,34,It was a sarcastic comment.
88,34,"Vaccines are not a health issue, but they are not one of the major a problem. What if a person went to a TIL that AIDS is the best way to stop the spread of a virus?"
95,34,"You don't have to tell me anything about how funny you are, but when it comes to pranks, I don't think you're being overly blunt. I think you're being way too literal."
97,34,OP needs a chance to explain how his statement was sarcastic.
34,17,What's the difference? What's the difference between a fake hat and a fake mask?
34,18,"I think people are trying to justify their statements, but not actually make a point. A lot of people are actually thinking that a mask is more than just a joke, but a prank."
34,20,I think the CDC should get rid of the mask.
34,26,"It is funny he did this. It isn't a joke, it's a joke."
34,27,You're basically being a prankster. I don't think the CDC is going to change anything.
34,29,">I think the CDC's stance to wear a mask is based on the government in the sense of preventing the spread of a virus,"
34,33,"I'm not saying this is a good explanation or an explanation, but I think that it's pretty clear that the article is trying to justify this behavior. I mean, the article does not address AIDS."
35,34,i am a big fan of the ACA. It's a big issue in Australia. It doesn't even exist in Canada.
45,34,This was meant to be a joke. It's a joke and isn't meant to be funny.
58,34,CANNOTANSWER is not a troll. CANNOTANSWER is a troll. CANNOTANSWER is a troll. CANNOTANSWER is a troll.
61,34,"My friend, at a high school, taught me to be a doctor and was called a troll by his wife while she was in school. She said she never realised it was a prank. I could barely believe it, and it wasn't a joke. I had heard this as a joke about my friends."
63,34,"""I have not seen that movie."""
75,34,">I see this as a very common joke, but it's not like the jokes are the jokes. I am not trying to be a troll, but I was trying to tell people that the people who make such jokes are being the trolls."
81,34,"It's a prank, it's the most dangerous thing in the world."
88,34,Vaccines are a health issue. You need to be vaccinated before you start going to a party.
95,34,What if a guy was forced to wear a mask to protect himself? I don't really think anyone else could.
97,34,"I don't see a way to get everyone else to do it - I know a coach is a big fan of all those sports, and I want to thank him for that. But he isn't saying it's a joke, it's that he is trying to deceive people with the president. It's just one way to stop people from getting a lot of negative publicity for a company."
34,17,"""We're not doing anything wrong, if we are going to help the world with a vaccine"""
34,18,It's a joke and a joke because a lot of people like it. Apparently the CDC is just trying to make the president look worse.
34,20,It's a funny quote. It's more likely it's because he wants to get rid of the mask to prevent the spread of the AIDS epidemic
34,26,"No, it's a joke. It's a joke because they're trying to make a joke about them. It's a joke about their own lives. I'm not trying to be a troll. I am pointing out what's really going on in the headline. It's the a joke. It's a joke, and it's a joke."
34,27,This is a joke. This is a joke. This is a joke. This is a joke. This is a joke. This is a joke. It is a joke. This is a joke. It is a joke. This is a joke.
34,29,"That is so weird. I love football, and I've seen it before, and had my hands covered up for years after the injury."
34,33,CANNOTANSWER is a troll. I don't have a question.
35,34,A new article came up about someone who is blaming Obama for the ACA.
45,34,A doctor would probably tell the guy to get a fucking mask before he was in a con.
58,34,Basically what a troll is - a troll who isn't willing to do the right thing.

81,34,I think that the first thing that comes to mind here is that it's just a prank.
88,34,"If I'm in an area where there is not enough public health care, I'm going to go."
95,34,"[Hey, i see. We were just having fun talking about the prank."
97,34,I don't like the way some people use sarcasm to convey negative ideas. I love that the article is so misleading and misleading.
34,17,... I'm not saying that the president was right. That was the joke. That the ACA was an attack on our economy. That's just a joke that's been used by all sorts of politicians to undermine the ACA.
34,18,"The idea of the government trying to make a joke seems odd to me. A government in place that is supposed to make a joke is sarcastic, and I feel like you're being a troll."
34,20,> The joke is: I don't like wearing a mask if I can't wear a mask if I'm sick of coughing
34,26,What kind of prank is a troll?
34,27,"I'm not going to delve into this further. The story itself is a joke, a joke, but this one is a joke. This one is just a joke. I really appreciate the satire."
34,29,The fact that this sarcasm is a joke doesn't mean that it is wrong.
34,33,"I love you, and I am sorry to hear you aren't feeling well, so I'm going to have to put this aside. This was really funny and a good way to say thank you if you're feeling well.

95,34,"Yeah, and in my opinion the movie is the best example of a prank because it's a prank, that's for sure."

She isn't too worried about getting it. She's not being a prankster. You don't want to get your head in a pony tail. You don't want to take her off the face of a car at work.

35,34,The CDC will go back and take a look at the ACA. ACA doesn't have a mandate. I don't think it is a bad idea for government to make a remark in public about the ACA.
45,34,It sounds like a prank.
58,34,It's not a joke. 'The problem with putting on a mask is the lack of education.'

34,26,It was a joke. It wasn't a prank. It was a prank. But that's the part of the joke that got me into the movie.
34,27,I don't want to be a prankster. I want to be a funny doctor.
34,29,"I don't know, but I understand what you're trying to say and it sounds like the jokes are about the masks."

63,34,'Pause a prank isn't a joke' is just a good way to describe it.
75,34,"There is a lot of BS in this sub, especially about the US health care system."
81,34,"I don't see how ""we were just a bunch of people,"" or ""our attitude is still sexist and the president is not in any way a joke."""

97,34,"""We're not just a guy who will wear a mask,"""
34,17,He's being ridiculous and lying to make a fool out of the idea that a mask isn't needed. Then he doesn't go to the doctor. I would say that's a great movie. It's very interesting.

34,26,"The joke is that the CDC is attempting to put a law that will prevent the spread of AIDS and the AIDS epidemic is at the forefront of the conversation, and that it's not necessary."
34,27,I'm pretty sure most people are confused as to why the CDC wants to help people with HIV/AIDS. But it's not a joke.
34,29,"Vaccination is not a joke, the mask is a part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
34,33,"You know what I love the most is that your username is a little bit more complex. This is not an issue of politics and i don't believe in a prank on you and the president, you can't be all naive. Its a good joke to do. The movie is good. It's good."
35,34,...and it seems that the CDC is the one that's preventing the ACA.
45,34,Vaccination is a joke because it is a joke. The fact that the president has been wearing a mask for nearly two decades because of the health care system.
58,34,"You are a troll if you're a troll. It's a troll because you are ignorant of the whole thing. You know, if you're a troll and don't like the way things are done, that's a troll."

63,34,I am not a politician.
75,34,I don't think that is the true issue with health care. There are no guarantees. No guarantees.
81,34,I think that's a great point. Certainly something they will have to work on.

I feel bad for the guy that is the guy.'', ''We are going to be a liar."""
97,34,What is not the point of this article? A lot of people are just going to be like you. I think the article is misleading because it makes no sense for the president to say so. It is why they have to work on this and get the correct answer.
34,17,It is a prank. It is a joke. It is not a prank. It is a joke.
34,18,"I think if people are going to be a troll, then it's a joke, not a joke, but rather an immature joke that's just a joke."
34,20,"I think it is a good example of what we need to keep in mind, and the article says that the fact that the president has been wearing a mask for nearly two decades is not enough to stop the epidemic."
34,26,"It's just a joke because the CDC is trying to put a law that will prevent the spread of AIDS and the AIDS epidemic at the forefront of the conversation, and that it's not necessary."
34,27,"This is an interesting story. I stumbled into a thread on a site that talks about how the people who do this are pranksters who are doing it. People with AIDS don't just get a mask, they get a hysterical, prank like attitude and behavior. They want it to be as funny as the shit they are talking about."
34,29,Is that what you're going to say?
34,33,I like this book! I'm going to watch it.
35,34,We do not want to talk about this to anyone. We are a government entity. We don't want to get to this.
45,34,You can't have a prank about a joke when you're talking about the person wearing a mask and then having a prank about that man's incompetence that was one of the reasons he wanted to become a president.

34,33,It is very funny. I love the movie and the movie.
35,34,You can see the big picture. There's a government in charge of vaccination and some people don't even think the government has a mandate.

63,34,a prank. It's an attempt to play a joke.
75,34,... but the fact that you are an adult makes the only way you can go about dealing with the epidemic that has happened.
81,34,"I'm pretty sure the reason the President isn't a politician is because of the mask, not because of the actual problem. The joke is more about the mask being a joke that means someone is lying and that is really not correct. I don't really get it either, i just think it's interesting that they are trying to manipulate the media into thinking he is actually being a prank and is in fact the real problem."
88,34,I think you were right. That was an extremely valid point and the message I received was that a mask isn’t a good idea but it is an important part of the story.
95,34,So is this a joke?

34,17,It was the most entertaining thing I ever watched in a long time and it really took me way more time to figure out what I was doing and what I'm doing now. The movie is great and very much worth watching.
34,18,The CDC is trying to help preventing HIV in America.
34,20,The book I'm a man also shows the actual problem.
34,26,I'm going to say this:
34,27,It's also a joke about pranksters who want the government to be a joke.
34,29,"I’m not a doctor, but I’m also a lawyer. My wife is a lawyer, and I believe that the CDC has a duty to take care of anyone who gets sick. I just don’t think that’s a valid reason. They’re not going to change the CDC’s policy."
34,33,The AIDS vaccine is one of the most important vaccines ever. It doesn't go in a million different directions in any given day. It's not a troll if the government is only making the joke. But it does seem like a troll if it's an asshole joke.
35,34,It's a joke. I think the ACA is a joke. I think the ACA is the one that the government is trying to repeal.
45,34,> Vaccination is a joke. It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of HIV/AIDS.

34,17,"I don't think he's being silly, he was just a joke."
34,18,"This is a really good, interesting post. It's not about this story itself, it's about the fact that it's a joke about a joke about a government in place. It's about a government in place that aims to aid in stopping the spread of HIV/AIDS."
34,20,The main reason the mask is not useful is because they do not want to be treated like the real thing. AIDS can't be cured without some form of treatment and there's no reason it should be removed.
34,26,"> The actual problem is how many people wear a mask, and when it happens, they die. Getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of AIDS, and in helping with it."
34,27,"It's not a prank, it's an observation. The CDC has said that people with AIDS are going to die, or that people who don't get a vaccinated are going to die, unless they have a doctor present to protect them from it."

45,34,There's a lot of things that people are not used to in this context.
58,34,A lot of the comments in the book are trolls and I am not the biggest prankster.
61,34,>I liked this movie because it tells a joke
63,34,i believe that the whole idea of putting on a mask is a prank and i think that i should be fine.
75,34,>We aren't supposed to be allowed to get a vaccinated person to wear a mask. Vaccines are not an important and effective tool for preventing the spread of a virus.
81,34,"A lot of people are trying to convince the government that this is a prank, but it isn't. You don't get a bunch of satire, and you don't get a lot of sarcasm either."

97,34,I'm not a very good coach.
34,17,>A lot of the comments in the book are trolls and I am not the biggest prankster.
34,18,I would agree with the commenter but let's say they don't want to be called a troll.
34,20,"It is kind of a shame that the whole article is a prank about this, because if you aren't interested, and don't want to get too upset, you are going to have to find a different way to interpret it. There are multiple ways to read it, but it doesn't sound like an explanation."
34,26,Vaccines can't be done by any individual but people who wear masks are not at risk of getting them.
34,27,"If it is a joke, people get a good laugh, and they do the actual job, and the joke gets a big laugh."
34,29,This isn't a joke. It's a prank and a good one. I'm going to give you a hand.
34,33,I was really surprised by how many people have thought about the AIDS vaccine. I think the article tries to explain that people were being pricks. I didn't believe the CDC was talking about AIDS.
35,34,"I think there's a big problem with the ACA. The way I see it, the ACA is not a joke, the reason I see it, is because I don't know what that means."
45,34,"I'm still young, and I'm not sure what it is."
58,34,People don't know the difference between a troll and a troll.
61,34,CANNOTANSWER is a doctor and one of my favorite authors.
63,34,I think this is a good way to tell you that the president of the US doesn't have the authority to ban it.
75,34,It's a nice time to be a doctor.
81,34,"Is there a reason why the movie is called ""I love that book?"""
88,34,"You know what if a man goes to the party with a mask? ""If you don't get the vaccine, he won't come with you. He won't come with you."""

34,33,tl;dr>> 'I love the book. I'm going to watch it. I love this book. I love the movie and the movie.'
35,34,It's a joke. A person who believes that a mask helps them in the fight to get them vaccinated is being a dick and is being an asshole.
45,34,There are people who seem to think that a prank is only a joke. A prank about a joke is just a joke.
58,34,"i’m not a doctor or a doctor, but i’ve seen some trolls and not been able to find a job"
61,34,"I love this movie, but I'm not a doctor, and I'm not a doctor. s"

81,34,"People who don't have a mask aren't pranksters, they just like the idea of being a joke."
88,34,It is funny and you are wrong & it is not a prank.

34,20,"""A friend of mine worked at a large health food and health system and he bought me a mask as a gift for his brother who was in need of one. He wore it for a few months and he was a big time AIDS patient. He told me I would be sick of coughing and he would come with me. He told me it was too easy to go in with me. He wouldn't come with me."""
34,26,It's a joke. The joke isn't a joke. The prank is about someone's personal needs and wants.
34,27,"What I like is that it makes the joke, it's the joke, because they want to be a funny guy, not to make a joke, or be a prankster."
34,29,I don't think I could do it again. Unless there is a medical emergency that a person gets injured in a prank...

45,34,"If you think this is a prank, this isn't."
58,34,... and then the jokes are added to the article. I've read about this and have read the whole book and some of the other stuff.
61,34,"My doctor friend just called the first part of the joke a rip off, and the movie was just the one that really made me laugh out loud. I had no idea the whole thing was a joke, but that's what she said - she said something along the lines of ""I hate the idea of wearing a mask but I can't imagine a joke when someone is asked to get a mask or a doctor and is called a delusional dick""- she got all her stuff out of her mouth in a joke and is making it hard to keep her mouth"
63,34,The devil wears a mask is essentially about a prank about a disease and the CDC is trying to stop it.
75,34,You said that the CDC has a good job at identifying what's wrong and who's not. They don't have any specific mandates on that.
81,34,It's interesting that they are trying to force a lot of people into accepting that the president's attitude and position on the subject of AIDS is sexist and not in any way a prank.
88,34,Vaccines are not health issues. They are not health issues. They are not health issues. They are not health issues. They are not health issues.
95,34,I didn't think the movie was a prank. The movie is about a prank that goes by some of the same definitions as the book. A prank isn't a prank.
97,34,"I would have to admit the first two parts are a bit uninformed, but the first one is more relevant: ""I think the President is trying to convince Americans to leave and don't understand the problems of the AIDS epidemic."""
34,17,"My husband had an allergy to AIDS, and I could barely handle it despite being vaccinated. I went to the CDC on my own, but my friend said that I figured it out. I thought he should be vaccinated or vaccinated because it was a new one. I also wanted to go to the CDC, but I didn't have the right to be in the CDC, and it was a prank. That's all we know about this prank and a joke that he was trying to help us."
34,18,"The movie was pretty good. It's also pretty entertaining. There's a bit of an underlying theme, y'know, if you know what I mean."
34,20,I'm the guy who just did a prank about this guy. He was the one that told the joke
34,26,"""I think the logical response is that people need to be put on their masks so they can get the vaccine that they need."""
34,27,"... ""Making a mask to protect yourself is a joke that people get a response from because they want to help fight off some sort of epidemic."""
34,29,I'm not sure what it is about the CDC's policy to prescribe a mask on players but there's a good reason to think that it's a prank.
34,33,"So, I'd like to remind you that the world's most important health issue is the AIDS vaccine, not the CDC's own treatment. You haven't actually gotten in touch with the CDC about it yet, but you've been able to get some good insight into the treatment of it. There is nothing that you can do about it except get that it is the AIDS virus. It is a prank, not an excuse for it. It's not a prank. It's a prank. You know the thing, you"
35,34,I'm trying to stoop to the side where I can't give the CDC a voice. I don't like being a snob. I know what I'm doing. I get that they are trying to make the world look better.
45,34,There's a funny comment here:
58,34,"I don't know how many of these statements are actually true. I mean, if a guy was wearing a mask to prevent the spread of AIDS, you could be telling the president the president needs a mask. The president needs to make a good point about all the ACA issues that impact his stance on the ACA."
61,34,"I am just gonna say, ""I'm not sure what the CDC's definition of a joke is. I can't imagine a joke where someone is asked to get a mask or a doctor and is called a delusional dick"""
63,34,"So, 'I wear a mask and the president doesn't want the CDC to ban it, because I'm on the wrong side of it, I can't tell if I want it banned or not.'"
75,34,"""I think I just read the title"
81,34,"It sounds like the president's not a prankster if we have a lot of hat jokes, and if it's one of the most dangerous things we do, you might be a prankster, but you cant make it out to be a prankster."
88,34,Vaccines are not health issues. They are not health issues.
95,34,It was probably the sappy one of the best movies.

34,17,"It was a good movie, and very entertaining! It is a prank. The movie is a prank. The movie is a joke. It is a prank. The movie is a prank."
34,18,"People have changed the way we look to'make' them look worse, but the president is in no way responsible for helping prevent this from happening. People are not as stupid or as kind of troll as they are in expressing their views."
34,20,There's more than one way to look at this. If you don't know where to begin with you may be more susceptible to AIDS.
34,26,"""It is funny he did this. It is a joke, not a joke."""
34,27,I'm just going to say it's a joke.
34,29,"A good example of a joke is if a guy is asked to get a mask so he can protect himself from a virus, then that person needs to get it, and the other player needs to be vaccinated. That means the player needs to be at a medical emergency ready to go."
34,33,"A lot of people in this thread were gonna get offended by the CDC's actions, and they are being downvoted."

63,34,"I can't explain a lot here. There are two problems here, namely:"

95,34,"You're trying to be blunt, but I think you are being way too literal."
97,34,"So basically the president has an issue. He is being a jerk, and the CDC is investigating. They aren't going after any players he doesn't know who is, and the president is attempting to get rid of him. I don't understand how someone can put a mask on a team while they are playing."
34,17,"Yeah, that is pretty interesting."
34,18,"No, there aren't any good facts to support that notion. You need to understand the nature of the issue and the nature of the question."
34,20,"I mean, he's putting on his mask because he has a fucking heart."
34,26,You're getting more into it than the joke I was referring to here.
34,27,"The movie is about the government wanting to help the people. It's funny because the media thinks it's a joke. There's no joke about this. The government wants to stop the spread of a virus, but isn't."
34,29,"'I see the problem with the word masked, but I don't think that's a good way to explain that a mask is the right thing to do. They need to have a safety camera in case someone is hit by a floppy disk.''"
34,33,> The article is basically saying that the president does not have an actual problem with the AIDS vaccine. The CDC isn't allowed to ban people from getting sick or getting STI's because they don't have a good job identifying them.
35,34,"I would just listen to the CDC in the background and the CDC's ""Anonymous"" statement that the CDC is trying to help the CDC."

34,27,People in America who don't have a mask are at risk of dying from the infection.
34,29,I'm just going to try to explain that what's the joke?
34,33,The article is really not funny.
35,34,"You could tell me that there is a lot of misinformation about what vaccination is. I am a huge fan of ACA. The ACA is a joke. The government is a troll, not a prank. The ACA is a joke."
