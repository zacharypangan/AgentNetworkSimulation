63,37,You can't live with your mask if you wear it in public.
66,37,It seems that wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus and then have a hysterectomy.
75,37,It is pretty cool to know if a state or city can impose restrictions on what you can wear to an event.
77,37,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.yes the newest strain is soooooo contagious just bc they have a mask on their hands pics don t mean they re using it
78,37,"I'm sure someone would disagree, they're not even allowed to tell the truth"
86,37,"Why don't you just go on a long, fun, and oh, you can't make a joke out of it? It looks funny, you think it's a fun joke?"
88,37,Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.

92,37,"Why don't you wear your mask if it is a health problem? The most important thing to do is to take care of your health, not your health."
94,37,I am going to go ahead and say 'I wear my mask when I m in public lawmaker who isn t wearing his mask in public says i wear my mask when i m in public lawmaker who isn t wearing his mask in public says i wear my mask when i m in public lawmaker who isn t wearing his mask in public says
63,37,"A lot of people here use masks, but the problem is that in a lot of places you get an infection."
66,37,Why don't you go to Twitchcon and buy the hoodie guys a mask?
75,37,There are so many things that would be considered illegal to use a mask.
77,37,"I'm confused, is the phrase 'Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus'?"
78,37,"I like the fact that this was a post with a lot of points about people getting off on stuff. It seems like this is pretty much a joke, but I don't think anyone is interested in it, at least in the context of why there are schools out there that are not on board with the mask. It's not a joke. This was a really stupid post, OP."
86,37,"Isn't the President wearing a mask? It isn't really the president wearing a mask, it is just that he's getting the same amount of attention as the rest of the president and being ""seen"" by the government and then being able to walk through a restaraunt with his own hands."
88,37,The first of this list of things to avoid that get asked a million times.
89,37,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
92,37,Unless you know what this means:

63,37,"It's the kind of thing that makes a team the better player they can be if they don't have to wear a mask. It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. You need a mask. I'm the one who said that masks are meant to protect the head, but a helmet must be worn to protect the head."
66,37,I'm so happy the vaccinating is so hard. The government is there to protect people from the spread of the virus. Its not a government thing to do but what is the point of that?
75,37,I think that's what the government is trying to do. It's very likely that they are just trying to sway the people on this side of the political spectrum to a point of not having a proper response to that conversation. I don't think they have any idea what's going on in their minds.
77,37,> Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
78,37,I don't think people have a right to know the truth. It's not a joke. I can tell you that. And this is just an example of why people think it is so important. It doesn't matter that people don't like wearing a mask. It matters that a person doesn't feel that they need to be in the world to survive. This is why people who don't like wearing a mask don't feel uncomfortable in public.
86,37,"ah yeah, i read that as a man of words covid."
88,37,"Is it possible that they were trying to cover up the problem by using an acronym, or is this something that the person in the video didn't really know about?"

63,37,No syringes are going to make a difference in the game.
66,37,"My hysterectomy was a joke and his facial hair was so bad his hair had come out, the mask made it bleed. It was just too gross and gross to be able to be a joke and a little cliche."
75,37,"You're referring to the program used by CDC, and it's the anti-virus campaign. It's one of those campaigns that focuses on preventing the spread of HIV. And a lot of things do go against the plan."
77,37,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. You have to resign and then get a new job. I feel you, but I'm curious to know what the difference is? I just went back and rewatched the original article and the whole thing just sounded like a piece of shit. Is that how the virus spread? By the way, it was a good conversation. So I would like to think it was good conversation."
78,37,The article states that there's a mandate to protect children from HIV/AIDS.
86,37,[How did you make a joke about this one?]
88,37,"[Don't know how it could be that if they didn't have a mandate for TB and STIs coverage, a lot of people would have had no idea what a booster is. I don't think it would have been a coincidence. They're not being that stupid in the video, so they aren't doing anything about it."
89,37,What did the doctor think was one of the dumbest things he's ever done?
92,37,There is a large number of countries that are doing the same thing as you. Most of the places aren't really so far away.
94,37,"People who wear masks get a lot of information about the government and the people who think they're dangerous and ill because of the mask. And those are not very interesting. I'd be interested in learning more about the people who wear masks, which is what emigration is, and what's important in your opinion."
63,37,":: But my wife is in the NFL now. We have a bunch of players that don't even have a helmet or a helmet for our games. When we were in the NHL, I'd always be scared and jumped to get a syringe for the ad and play a few minutes."
66,37,"I'm on mobile, and I'm going to do a bit of digging, but I don't need my brain blown out."
75,37,"My family is sick and it's a big deal that the government wants to do something about it, that it doesn't work as intended. There is a difference in what people would think. But it does. It's not like people would want to take a big risk of getting sick, even if they didn't need one."
77,37,I would probably bet that all of the people he's talking to aren't real doctors or nurses.
78,37,That's exactly what you say in a post.
86,37,You can't do the things you do when you don't want to.
88,37,The CDC are adamant about the vaccine coverage not being the right thing to do.
89,37,"As a doctor, I've actually learned to think. ""I thought this was a funny idea, but you're not going to stop me in this conversation if I don't. What would you do if you were wearing a mask to walk through a restaraunt, and you don't take it off when you get to your table?"""
92,37,This is true for most of the people. It seems the people are just trying to manipulate you.
94,37,I think we should wear the same mask every time someone else wants to wear a mask. I don't think this has ever been done. This is the most common misconception I've encountered in any public health situation - the lack of a health care provider who cares enough to do all of the right things without needing a mask.
63,37,> Why not use a mask with the same type of mask? It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
66,37,I think the most relevant part is that he's not in charge of vaccinating anyone and inventing new ways to stop the spread of the virus. He's just trying to get in control of his own business. That's one thing that seems to be a lot akin to his hysterectomy.
75,37,My wife and I went to a twitchcon in Wisconsin. We went through the CDC's anti-virus campaign and we didn't get vaccinated for a while. She asked if we could get some vaccines for this disease. We were given some in the CDC and they gave them away in return.
77,37,I think I'm going to be offended that he doesn't care enough about the health system to act based on the facts to fix the situation. It's one of the most important things that they have to do.
78,37,"I'm a CDC staff member and am on the public health board. I know you want to buy a helmet. But no, I don't think the ACA is a joke. I'm saying it's one of the best ways to protect people from the virus. I think people have a right to know the truth. It's just a joke. The mask law is an ACA and isn't about it."
86,37,"I don't think it's like putting on a mask, you don't know what that is."
88,37,CDC is just trying to talk to people on this sub and make sure they know their rights and not just a bunch of them.
89,37,... and they're actually getting into that. I think that's one of the biggest problems that Americans have with all the stuff that makes us ill.
92,37,"The first paragraph of this post is a bit vague, I think it's part of the whole thing that the government is trying to change, and the government has been trying to do so for quite some time. It's not an issue that the government is just trying to change what it sees about the HIV. The government is trying to change the health care system, not the person they censor."
94,37,"I was told by an article that there is a reason for the NSA's actions involving protecting vulnerable individuals from disease - the NSA uses surveillance techniques to do it in the hood, which aren't necessarily correct."
63,37,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
66,37,I am actually a huge fan of hysterectomy but it seems as though the President is being a tyrant who wants to get rid of the ACA.
75,37,"I am sorry, but if you go to any of the events you can't just put on a mask in the car with the rest of the pack and go to the CDC to get a test and test, he will say no and then go and get the test."
77,37,"I was surprised to read the headline. I'm not a big fan of any of the political views on this one. It's more of a satire, not a satire."
78,37,You're the person who has the largest public health population in the world. I'm the person who has the largest public health population in the world. I didn't want to put myself in a situation where I'd have a problem with someone not wearing a mask or anything that would put me in a worse place.
86,37,"> Is this an example of a lack of proper protection? ""It sounds like a simple rule of thumb for a lot of people to follow: Putting on a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."""
88,37,Vaccine coverage was supposed to help stop spread of a virus. But not without getting a booster.

94,37,"The NSA is responsible for preventing the spread of a virus, not the people that actually carry it."
63,37,I don't see how you can even be a fan of a government policy in some situations where putting on a mask would help you in this situation.
66,37,In this case I think he is a tyrant because of the fact that he does not have the right to get vaccinated. I would not be willing to have a conversation with him with his parents about it.
75,37,"Assuming that you are a doctor, you are required to wear the right mask. They are illegal if you do not know the laws."
77,37,"""The president's mask would be just as dangerous as his hands. He'd be wearing his mask to show some rage to the people, but would then be able to stand up for himself. So that's why I'm an anti-HIV/AIDS supporter."
78,37,What makes the ACA joke?
86,37,"I hate to say it, but if people don't put on a mask a lot it's just an act of bad news and I'd be more upset if people didn't put on a mask on. That's all."
88,37,I don't think it's actually a big deal. It's a very small thing to do. Most people have no idea about it because they don't know it.
89,37,"I love this movie, and this story is one of my favorites. It's a great movie, and you're absolutely welcome!"
92,37,I don't know the source but I'm from Australia.
94,37,A lot of people don't get to use a mask when they're not in the field.
63,37,> Is the head mask part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
66,37,I would be willing to go to Twitchcon and buy the hoodie guys a mask.
75,37,People who are not vaccinated are not supposed to get a vaccinated person to wear a mask.
77,37,I don't really understand how they'd do it without the ACA.
78,37,"The best way to prevent infections is to make your body use a mask. The first time it happens, it's because it's a joke and you don't want to resent it. The second time, if it happens again, is to make your brain work on an irradiated virus. This is a joke that everyone is willing to prank."
86,37,The fact that a lot of people slammed the Obama administration is an example of a lack of proper protection.
88,37,Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of a virus. Please wear masks.
89,37,I love this movie. I'm going to see it with my friend right now.
92,37,"I had to be on a bus for two weeks and I can't go to work now because the only place I can go is into the US for a few months, and I can't go anywhere for a month. I'm going to be doing work right now but I have to do business now."
94,37,"'I think it's more important to wear a mask than the guy who doesn't. I think it's pretty cool that you don't like the idea of it. Wearing a mask when a person is being attacked. It sounds like a good idea, and a good one."
63,37,"That's right, and there's nothing in this sub that actually speaks to you as a member of the government."
66,37,I'm sorry but you're probably right about that.
75,37,"Those things are illegal in most cases. The ACA is a bad example of government retribution, and a good example of government retribution."
77,37,>Is wearing a mask an example of a lack of proper protection? Because that's a big fucking no
78,37,"My daughter has an idea called the ""Potentially Anti-Asia Act"", where she has a mask and wants to wear it for the sake of public health. I don't know if it's a joke. But I'm not that sure about this."

77,37,The first paragraph is so long I'm curious to know what the difference is?
78,37,It seems like people haven't heard that the ACA does not address the issue of vaccinating people without a mask.
86,37,"So, you're describing your dad as a ""mummy"", a fucking doctor, and a troll?"
88,37,I feel like a bunch of these idiots just feel that they should stop going to public schools and get the vaccine.
89,37,"I'd like to emphasize that wearing a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when you get to your table is one of the dumbest things that I have done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask. I like it because I feel ya. I know, I don't, but I'm not too fond of doing that."

94,37,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. Its not about the NSA. Is it about the NSA or about her job in a CIA office? I'm glad we're finally moving to something with a ""freedom"" thing."

75,37,"My aunt used to say that it was pretty cool that they had an anti-viral campaign. She also said it was an anti-viral campaign, though she also believes that the ACA is an anti-vaccine campaign. I don't understand why they wouldn't say anything about it."
77,37,"I thought I was going to say: I think that the ACA and people on the internet are talking about the government's anti- AIDS policy, and the ACA, not AIDS. The government is pointing out how harmful a policy is and not stating why it's bad. A bunch of the apocryphal apocryphal propaganda articles that go on and on about the ACA scream ""Oh the ACA is an antisemitic act. That's a prank and a joke. I think the ACA's"
78,37,"It's a joke to say that 'you guys are crazy! You know, people just make jokes. Just don't do them anymore.'"
86,37,I'm sorry but you don't understand the context of your post.
88,37,"Vaccines are not a good way to stop a virus, but they do seem to be better than those to stop a virus from spreading, or if you do, then you should still get the vaccine."
89,37,"And if it makes you feel better, you would suck a shitload of pain."
92,37,The problem is that they are going to have to make it a problem to keep you out of the healthcare system and in some ways it will keep you out of the healthcare system.

75,37,"It's not as if you have a problem getting sick from something, you have to get vaccinated."
77,37,Those kinds of people are called trolls. The most basic rule of what they are doing is to get offended and get a job. The CDC says that being unknowingly bitten by a virus is a symptom of AIDS (or at least isn't at all infected); it is an act of terror.
78,37,...and that's why people can't be smart.

92,37,"The Obamacare bill is in effect. It was adopted in October, 2005. No, I don't have to use a mask for health care, but you can use it in public places if you want. It's because the person who is complaining is expressing a different viewpoint than the other comments."
94,37,"If I don't think it would make a difference, I'd like to wear a mask to combat a viral infection."
63,37,I see what you're saying.
66,37,"The ACA, he's not a leader. His hysterectomy was just to try and keep people out of the system. He is in control of his own business."
75,37,I don't know how many of the other vaccinators are citing the ACA as an example of government retribution.

78,37,I wore a mask in my freshman year of college to protect students from HIV/AIDS. It was an honor. It's an excuse to not wear a mask in public school. The other teachers did mention the problem.
86,37,I've seen a lot of the comments i've seen and i just can't find any context.
88,37,Vaccines can help stop a few of the biggest AIDS cases. It's the best way to stop a virus. Please wear masks.
89,37,"if you think it makes you feel better, you will suck a shitload of pain."
92,37,"... or you could say, ""It's a tyrant. It's like saying you have to be a scientist or a political scientist to get your fucking heads in a sailor's hat. What a tyrant.""."
94,37,Vaccination is not a government-sponsored program that makes money and creates jobs for all its employees and a government-run bureaucracy.
63,37,Is this the same film which is the only nfl film to have an AIDS issue in it?
66,37,... and this is the only way I can tell you that I'm against the ACA.
75,37,What a little bit of snarky talk.
77,37,"As the person who wrote that ""I don't think the president should wear a mask to fight the flu."
78,37,You don't think that the ACA is a joke. The ACA is a joke because it is a joke. I think the ACA is a joke because it is a joke.
86,37,"I can't tell if I am wrong, but the whole idea of wearing a mask is pretty depressing."
88,37,It's a dick joke.
89,37,"Is that a joke? I read about people wearing hats for fun, I don't really believe that they're the ones who make the joke."
92,37,"> As a US citizen, I am glad that I have to deal with this."
94,37,I've contacted several people in the past. I'm an advocate for 'putting masks on'in public. The majority I know wear them are women.
63,37,"Considering how easy it is to find a doctor to make a medical diagnosis, the CDC has a lot to say about the effectiveness of this procedure."
66,37,That's probably the only way I'm sure this would be a decent conversation about why he would not wear a mask because he's a doctor.
75,37,They are trying to change a lot of the laws on what they do and are not doing anything about it.
77,37,"The government has no right to remove it or prevent it, which makes it a bad idea to allow people to wear a mask to be infected, which is a moral issue. The issue is the ACA."
78,37,So I don't really know what a joke is because the ACA is a joke.
86,37,"""It sounds like a simple rule of thumb for a lot of people to follow: Putting on a mask is what you need to protect yourself from, in order to prevent the spread of a virus."

89,37,I would think that most people wouldn't care what people think. Because it's just too funny and ridiculous for a hat to be just a joke about someone not having a hat.

78,37,"The joke is a joke, but it's not a joke because it's a joke."
86,37,This is a real conversation. This is the only conversation that will keep us in our minds.
88,37,It's the CDC's job to fuck it up.
89,37,"There's a lot of humor in that and it's definitely a joke, but when it gets to the point where someone is using it as a form of distraction, it's kind of hard to find the joke."
92,37,"'( I'm so terribly sorry that my doctor was not there. If you are looking to go to the doctor, I'd ask about insurance."
94,37,The only thing that isn't happening here is that the government has already become more like the CIA.

66,37,I'm gonna give you a good reading a few weeks down the road.
75,37,"This was a really weird way to respond to this. Almost every politician in the US wants to do something about the healthcare industry, whether or not they voted for it or not."
77,37,"The CDC says that being unknowingly bitten by a virus is a symptom of AIDS (or at least isn't at all infected); it is an act of terror."""
78,37,"This is just a very important one. In the last 6 months, this has been one of the most important and infuriating things for the nation. The fact that it's such a bad joke is a major one."
86,37,I'm gonna guess that the guy was trying to use the NSA as a defense mechanism to combat HIV.
88,37,"My mother always told me that my dad's dad was a little naive, and it made her a little angry about it."
89,37,A friend of mine told me he used a mask to walk 10 feet in a doctor's office. It's a great prank.
92,37,"> '(I'm so terribly sorry that my doctor was not there. If you are looking to go to the doctor, I'd ask about insurance.'"
94,37,I think this is the most common misconception I've encountered in any public health situation - the lack of a health care provider who cares enough to do all of the right things without needing a mask.
63,37,“Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.”
66,37,"CANNOTANSWER is the author of a book called ""Chilli's List. I just wanted to make sure. The author isn't going to change the facts because he's already been told about the ACA veto. The author is clearly in a coma with the trolls."
75,37,"CANNOTANSWER'S BAD PARTY: Wearing a medical mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. Its a terrible idea to not get a vaccine. The CDC, the CDC, the CIA and the CDC all want to work with the government to stop the spread of the disease. Vaccines are not an unavoidable part of the program. Vaccines are not an unavoidable part of the program."
77,37,It's a joke if you think people aren't interested.
78,37,"It's a joke, and it's one of the most important things for the country."
86,37,It's a joke.
88,37,"As someone who has vaccinated for many reasons, I couldn't care less. My mother always told me that my dad was a little naive, and it made her a little angry about it. Vaccines are not health issues. They are not health issues. Vaccines and STIs are not the same thing."
89,37,"They prank about it, because people would think that it's a joke. But it's a prank. I don't even like the movie."
92,37,"oh yeah, I have to deal with this. What a tyrant."
94,37,"The idea of the NSA is pretty cheesy and seems silly. The idea is that the CIA and other private entities are not required to have a public health provider who cares enough to do all the right things. It's not about the government, it's about the CIA and 'what if' it makes people think that you don't want to hear about it. The idea of putting a mask on when someone else wants to wear one is really shitty."
63,37,The CDC has a lot to say about the effectiveness of the mask.
66,37,"So basically we're going to start off by not reading and arguing about hysterectomy, but talking about the Obama administration, huh. I don't know, but I'm curious about the fact that hysterectomy was used to fight syphilis or at least try to get a blood test and isn't that about hysterectomy. Basically I don't know, but I know this is not a bad idea and it's really a troll."
75,37,"the CDC is working on making a permanent ACA so that it can be used to control the spread of disease, not the federal government. i.e. to prevent infections from spreading to other diseases."
77,37,It's an antisemitic act that the CDC has been discussing for years.
78,37,"As a student, I wore a mask for a first day in high school. I didn't want to risk a job because of it. But I wanted to be with someone. So I was a sick student. But I wore my hat for a reason. It was an excuse to not wear it and to protect against the spread of AIDS. It's a joke, but it's a joke because it's a joke."
86,37,"Why was he wearing a mask? Because he was slamming on the gov't, and the gov't is putting effort into stopping the spread of a virus."
88,37,Its not funny. I'm not a scientist or anything. I can tell you that I'm just saying that the CDC and the other anti-vaccine groups have a duty to address the issue. The idea of getting vaccinated is what the CDC is doing.
89,37,"I think the question is that because it makes you feel better you won't care about the joke, and you've just got to think of it like you are a fucking pedophile."
92,37,"I'm not a doctor, but I've heard of this before. It's part of the health care system, and the way it's used, is not the kind of thing you're looking for in someone who is trying to protect you."

I'm not saying it's OK to wear a mask, but I do know that the ACA is an antisemitic act. It's just a joke and not the truth."
78,37,I don't think it's a joke. There are no other public health issues that could have been addressed in an Obama era tv show. There are people who are not in favor of the ACA.
86,37,This is a real prank.
88,37,What if a person went to a TIL that AIDS is the best way to stop the spread of a virus? What are some of the different types of AIDS?
89,37,"It seems like a spoof of a classic movie, with a lot of people who don't have a real sense of humor and don't seem to know what it's about. The fact that it was a spoof of a classic movie makes me think it's pretty funny."
92,37,"I don't like to read, but I really do like that guy. He's a fucking idiot."
94,37,"It's a very nebulous idea. But it's very possible for those who wear masks to be able to prevent those that are sick to pass vaccines. So it's really not just about the NSA, it's about the government and the CIA."
63,37,"The NSA is probably the best joke in the game because it says it is, in part, a joke and not an ad."
66,37,"The author of the book, [NAME] called CANNOTANSWER."
75,37,Vaccines are not an essential part of the CDC's treatment for AIDS. The CDC is helping to make it illegal for Americans to have a vaccine.
77,37,“I'm wondering why he is trying to make a hollywood movie about his political career.”
78,37,I'd say the government's job is to stop the spread of HIV. You can't be a bad fuck. But the problem is that the ACA is a joke that everybody is willing to avoid.
86,37,i read this in a conversation with a guy and his wife from an 'all about trump's 'the i think this is pretty funny.'
88,37,We're not making a spoof of a classic. This is not just a movie.
89,37,"I thought a bit of that in the beginning, and I think I'm a bit sarcastic. It's been a while since I've seen any prank videos. Luckily, the film was a good one."
92,37,We're looking at the US healthcare system. They have a whole lot of problems. That's why the U.S. doesn't want to be involved in the health care system.
94,37,"I think I'm going to throw up and walk away, because the NSA can't keep me out of a public office. In other words, it's very obnoxious. It's not only bad, but it's an inconvenient notion.

88,37,"It's been done many times. In my opinion, this is the only way to keep us safe."
89,37,"They're not trying to stop you from being uncomfortable with the pranks because you're not uncomfortable with them. You're trying to push the point out that a lot of the stuff you're describing is just a prank, but at the same time, you're not comfortable with a prank."

94,37,I'm a bit ashamed to admit this... but I'm very thankful that there are more Americans who have been vaccinated than the people who are in a single person in the US.
63,37,There's been no mention of a CDC/Detroit AIDS issue in a comment before.
66,37,It's not about the ACA. It's about the way he's getting rid of it.

77,37,The author has written some of these articles. It is a pretty good read.

86,37,"There are many different things that fall under the phrase ""prankster. I don't think this is a prank, it is a joke."" It's not as much as the idea of the ACA being used to prevent the spread of HIV. The ACA is not something that you should think about or talk about, but rather an attempt to keep people from thinking that it is a prank."
88,37,My dad was a little naive when he told me that. I'm sure he'd be confused as to why.
89,37,I just found a video of a friend doing something similar that was used to make a video about this. It's a really good movie - it was made by a person that made a prank.

I think people have a right to know the truth. It's just a joke. The mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. The only difference is the name.

89,37,My favorite story is the scene where the guy is actually wearing a hat to make people laugh.
92,37,"Is this the same guy who wrote ""The ACA isn't a good idea""?"

I just think that it’s a joke. Especially when you’re in a situation that doesn’t warrant a prank because it’s funny."
92,37,"Is it the ""Assault on the government"" comment? I don't think that explains it. But as soon as you say that, I'll move on to something else."

77,37,I genuinely enjoyed the first two paragraphs of your post. It's interesting because the ACA is the most basic thing to do when dealing with the American public.
78,37,"The entire purpose of the ACA is to keep the people out of trouble. They can't just leave it in the hands of their children. They can't get to a CDC with a mask. It's a joke, and it's a joke.

66,37,The author of the book is in the middle of an argument that he is against the ACA. Clearly the author of the book doesn't have a case for an ACA veto.
75,37,It's really funny how the CDC is being a huge piece of shit. This is so sexist.
77,37,I think the CDC's position is that the ACA is only a joke because the people in it have been outraged about it and would like to know how it is actually not a joke. It's basically a joke about being vaccinated if the government wants to do it.
78,37,A joke is a joke if you believe it. You don't know what a joke is and how to make a joke. But it's not a joke because it addresses the problem.

86,37,The ACA is not supposed to prevent the spread of HIV or other AIDS or any other disease. The CDC does not even have to be involved in combating it. The CDC is responsible for treating it. People who care about HIV/AIDS would rather avoid the disease and they wouldn't do a job preventing it.

88,37,"I think the point of being a prank in this sub is to make people think they are right. Because the people who say ""We have to go and get vaccinated"" are essentially the worst kind of people on the planet. A lot of people don't understand what 'protection' is.

89,37,"There isn't really anything funny about pranks, but the idea of a prank in a movie is always a joke."
