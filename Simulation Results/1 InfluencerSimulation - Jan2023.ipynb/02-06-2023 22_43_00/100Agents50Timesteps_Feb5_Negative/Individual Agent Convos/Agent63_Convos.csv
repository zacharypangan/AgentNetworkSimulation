I was able to get around the restaraunt and not to have to go to the restroom, but I still felt a little bit sick from it, and he decided to try it in an emergency.

63,42,"I mean, if the NSA did that to the athletes (that's like a big bang, the kids who fought the syringe wouldn't go anywhere, they would never know what was going on there), then the people in the NCAA would be crazy about it."

74,63,I think this is a good time to talk about the government.
94,63,This is not going to be a conversation between the NSA and a government worker. I'm going to argue that the issue that comes up on this sub is more about the government and the way that you want to communicate with people.
95,63,Were there any hammers? I've seen the movie a few times as a kid and it doesn't seem like one of the better movies of all time. I love that movie.

63,11,"I'm surprised there isn't an explanation. As a young person I think I've seen the movie I'm a man, and there's not much info on it, but I've seen the movie and had to say something along the lines of I wish I'd been able to eat it while sprayed, which is more of a medical treatment than an emergency situation, and I think that's why I'm not sure it's really an emergency."
63,19,"I'm pretty sure that all the states will have regulations to stop the spread of a virus. So in order to be a member of the government and not to be an official member, you should be on a cuff wearing a mask. I've seen a few things on here that I'm not very familiar with."
63,21,"I can see where you're coming from - a little confusion. I would be quite interested in watching the movie I'm a man, and I can see how the government uses it to be spied on."
63,22,"The first part of the sub is more about the government, and I agree with the other two. I don't see how you can even be on the wrong side of the issue. I think you need to ask yourself this: ""Dad, I need a I'm not sure how many people in the US actually wear masks, just that they don't know much about the system and the facts. They're just trying to push the issue aside, but if I were to say I'd have done it all the time, would I."""

You haven't gotten to know that the NSA is responsible for the spread of a virus. Its pretty cool that you are not a government employee. Its really cool that you do not like the idea of it. Its pretty cool that you do not like the idea of it.

The other commenters didn't make the connection to the issue, they didn't make a connection to the issue, and what if the players did and then didn't wear the mask."
63,3,"A ""Masks You to Wear"" is just a question: How do you know a person is a member of the government? How can you tell if they are or not a member of the government?"

63,33,Is the head mask part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus?
63,34,A lot of people are wrong. I think there's a lot of truth to the story. The movie is about an inability to understand where the virus has been spread. People have to realize the danger and they should see that the masks are being used to keep people from seeing them.
63,37,"That's right, and there's nothing in this sub that actually speaks to you as a member of the government."
63,42,"A lot of people don't realize that putting on a mask is a ""thing"" that's really cool to the NSA."

63,21,He didn't 'put on a mask' for a game. He just wore a syringe to go through the restaraunt.
63,22,There are other issues here. How is this going to get through to the US? What is the purpose of a mask?
63,25,"No, he’s a troll. They’re trying to get his point across."
63,33,A lot of people have an issue with that.
63,34,I think this is a good way to tell you that the president of the US doesn't have the authority to ban it.
63,37,I think this guy is just trying to convince people that he's a prankster. He needs a syringe. He's trying to make people sick. he's trying to make it a joke.
63,42,The film has a lot of elements that make it about the anti-virus movement. It is actually about the CDC and the vaccine that works.
63,53,"There is a difference between ""not really "" and ""a lot of people in the US actually wear hats"""
63,56,The first paragraph doesn't actually mention the CDC. The article talks about what the CDC is doing.
63,62,"I'm not an expert, but I have a theory. It's not a joke. If it was to help the CDC, then I would not rely on the government, which is an important part of the CDC's role in the country, to stop the spread of a virus. I think there is also a big problem with it: the government's efforts to control how many people are sick and ill (or the CDC's) and how many people are sick in terms of the problem and preventing them from doing something about it."
74,63,>We should watch the movie and see what they say. That's the point.
94,63,"I'm not sure what's even worse that when the NSA is banned from wearing masks in public, it's because it's illegal, and if it's banned from wearing a mask in public, it's illegal. If it's banned from wearing a mask in public, it's illegal."
95,63,A prank that wasn't really meant to be a joke.
97,63,It seems the President is the victim of a joke in this sub.
63,3,That's a very interesting idea.
63,6,The jokes in that movie aren't about the CDC. They're about the people in the CDC and their role in the vaccine.
63,11,The fact that a lot of people in the US wear a mask to stop a virus makes it illegal.
63,19,[[...I think the biggest problem with it](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_File/wiki/Files/Files/Files/Files/Status_A_Mom_Making_Making_Making_Making_Making_Making_Making_Making_Making_Making_Making_Making_Making_Making_Making.](http://en.wikipedia.
63,21,"That's not a joke at all. This is the point of a wikipedia article, you're saying that the government is being spied on. It's not a joke. But it is a joke. The CDC and the CDC do the same thing in general."
63,22,"I agree with you about the 'non 'right to ban a syringe in public. I'm not sure how much of an issue it is or how to explain the problem. But I want to give a very clear explanation. I'm a huge fan of ""putting on a mask to go through a restaraunt"" because it makes people realize that it's a prank. I can say for sure that the only difference is a person's ability to think on their feet and he's not a very good player."
63,25,"""Sometimes a movie is more prank than a book. Sometime a joke comes off as a joke. Sometime a joke comes off as a joke. Sometime a joke comes off as a joke. Sometime a joke comes off as a joke."
63,33,"Is there a movie or other movie that covers syringes? Unless you are a fan of the CDC, you're probably a bit biased."
63,34,"It's a joke that's about an inflammatory disease. It's not a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke, but it's not a prank."
63,37,The NSA and The National Vaccine Agency are doing a great job of stopping the spread of AIDS and they are trying to stop it. It just seems like they are not willing to stop it.
63,42,This is what the CDC is asking the president to do for the sake of the anti-virus movement.
63,53,"As a former NFL fan who doesn't follow football, I would suggest looking up a lot of posts and see if they seem to have all these references to the jokes. Like the movie The Devil Wears A Mask, where it's about a guy putting on a mask to stop a virus in his mouth. It's essentially about the CDC and the vaccine that works."
63,56,"I had a guy do this once (in some parts of America) and we were talking about that he is just a prankster, even when the joke is just a prank on someone."
63,62,"Isn't that the one that says ""I'm sorry that I am getting downvoted.""?"
74,63,It's a prank based on an article by the govt. This prank was about the government. It was a prank about the govt. That's not what I'm talking about.
94,63,"Because they don't want to be involved with that shit. If they do, they will just get an axe and move on."
95,63,"> The movie is not a movie, but it doesn't fit the description."

The jokes in that movie aren't really meant to be a joke. It seems the President is the victim of a joke in this sub. That's a very interesting idea.
63,11,"So in this case, I'm a man and wearing a mask to prevent a virus in my mouth is actually not a prank?"
63,19,"> But I think the biggest problem with it is the lack of understanding about why the people who wear it aren't going to get the job."""
63,21,I don't think the article is misleading.
63,22,"""This is a joke that's about the government. It's not a joke. They're doing a great job of stopping the spread of a virus. They are trying to stop it."
63,25,Yes. No. It's a problem. It's not a joke. It's a joke. It's a problem. The NSA can do it. It's a problem. It's a problem. It's a problem. It's a problem. It's a problem. It's a problem.
63,33,Is there something about the CDC or the CDC that could be a joke?
63,34,The devil wears a mask is essentially about a prank about a disease and the CDC is trying to stop it.
63,37,"Then it is not an interesting topic to ask, but something to add to this subreddit. What exactly do you want the president to do?"
63,42,I think this one makes perfect sense.
63,53,"I'd like to put it in more context, to the extent that I am just a very conservative person. And a good portion of this guy is a bit of a shill. I hate to say that, but I think this shit is funny."
63,56,Is it not in the book? Because that is a joke.
63,62,It's probably a prank.
74,63,a lot of people would like to find the movie.
94,63,"It's the CIA, and not the NSA."
95,63,"If you read the description, you'll see the point of it. Having a prank in your life is a joke. I'd like to see a movie where the prankster and whoever is doing the prank on you go to the same time, and then then the prankster is doing it again. You could go to the same place. You could try to get rid of the prankster because they're a little insecure and want to talk about a prankster."
97,63,I don't know what's going on with this sub. Is that the one that's putting a head mask on? I don't think there is a joke on the internet right now.
63,3,I am a professor of English.
63,6,"...I remarked that I'm a little overreacting here, and that it sounds like I've done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest thing a movie ever."
63,11,"I'm not sure what you mean. You're making a joke, and I don't agree with what you're saying. I was just being a little skeptical."
63,19,"That's why it's called ""Making Ms. Masks"" and that's how it's called ""Making Ms"" in the US : The movie is a prank. It's not about the syringe. It's about the people who wear them, but it's about the people who do it."
63,21,I see that a big issue here. It's really the issue in the book but the story is kind of off topic.
63,22,"“When i wear a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when I get to my table, and then doing a lot of dumb things putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when I get to my table,”"
63,25,The NSA is really a troll. It is trying to scare people into doing it. It's a problem. It's a problem. It's a problem. It's a problem. It's a problem. It's a problem.
63,33,"I've got a lot of pranks on my phone. I don't care whether or not I've got a job I can do, it's just a prank."

63,56,"I've actually been asked to read the article as ""It's really a joke that's about the government,"" and it's quite clearly stating that ""It seems the NSA isn't the government."""
63,62,>The movie isn't really a prank. It's about the syringe. It's about the ring finger popping it out and the syringe slipping out of your ring finger.
74,63,"I think the film is a good idea for the upcoming episode of 'Come on, we're gonna try to stop this by the end of this week'."
94,63,Why would they be able to stop people from wearing a mask if they don't want to?
95,63,", ''Sometimes a joke comes off as a joke.''"
97,63,The Obama administration is going after the Presidents own health care.

63,11,"Basically the NSA is a prank to scare people into doing the things the NSA does. It is not a prank, the NSA is a troll."
63,19,There is a lot of good content posted about the film and the pranks. I haven't read the book but I do know some of the jokes. So I don't know what you mean.
63,21,And it's the reason why they would be going after the President's health care if it was a joke.
63,22,I think the movie is really about the problem.
63,25,"Yes, that's a lot."
63,33,I'm not a doctor. I know how to use the CDC. I'm not an ENT (health care provider) but this is a prank.
63,34,"I can't explain a lot here. There are two problems here, namely:"
63,37,"[Movie title: The MTV Movie The White House, r/faqs]."
63,42,"I feel that the whole ""I love the movie"" thing isn't as well-known, I think I have enough to explain to the people he is talking to and to the people they are talking to that they are worried about that's the reason he wore it."
63,53,"""The problem is the lack of understanding about why the people who wear it aren't going to get the job."
63,56,I'm surprised that the movie isn't a prank. The NSA isn't a government entity. Is it? No.
63,62,"I don't think it was the prank that caused the problem and I think it's because they don't want to be the one that has the syringe on. The joke is a joke, and this was the end of it, not that it caused any problems with the CDC."
74,63,CANNOTANSWER FILE
94,63,The reason for the lack of protections is because people want to avoid the threat of getting sick and therefore they are stifling government programs.
95,63,"You may be on to something, but in the book the book seems to be the first to be addressed."
97,63,"I want to point out that the President was a racist snide, but the truth is that he is a racist."
63,3,This is what makes a lot of people do a joke about it:
63,6,the thing about the syringes is that they are basically made of plastic
63,11,I don't think there is an explanation. I don't really want to be seen doing what it's supposed to be about. I like to think it's an issue. I'm not going to talk about this one. Its not going to happen. I'm not going to be a doctor or anything and I would never want to do it. Is it possible for us to get the info about a prank or a prank?
63,19,"It's a joke, and they're just letting people down. But if there isn't a CDC/CDC in the US that's a prank. It's just the CIA is not going to allow it."
63,21,As far as i know the nba and the racial bias is the one that is making me question the existence of this kind of stuff.
63,22,"I can't see a reason to use that phrase. I see no reason to put a mask on a person who is allergic to a sports sport (whether they're a professional athlete, a soccer player, a swole player, or a coach) for anything. I would just use the phrase ""the problem isn't the government"" more often, since you just didn't understand what it meant, so I don't see why it should be said."
63,25,"If you are talking about the NSA, that's a pretty damn good point."
63,33,"I mean, that's the one he's talking about, and he's talking about the syringes he wants to have and he has no idea how it works. He's not a prankster, just a joke."

63,62,Then go out and join the CDC. They will help you get vaccinated if it's a prank.

63,6,"I can only understand what he means by the phrase ""I think it's really a funny movie"""
63,11,"Those who don't wear masks do not need them. And as a fan, I really dislike putting on a mask, especially when I can't stand going through the restaraunt and then taking it off. I can't troll anyone. I'm not a troll myself."
63,19,"A prank, by definition, is a prank. It's not a prank."
63,21,This is why we can only be as good as ourselves and not as bad as the guy who invented it.
63,22,This is a very good point.
63,25,“The NSA is really a troll. It is trying to scare people into doing it. It is a problem. It's a problem. It's a problem. It's a problem. It's a problem. It's a problem.

63,3,I would read this whole thing and consider it to be a prank and not a real one.
63,6,"I like this one because it is a really interesting discussion, and it is the one in which he is very much concerned with the problem."
63,11,I don't think you are being trollish. You just didn't get to tell a lie. You're asking for a joke to get people to do a prank to you.
63,19,"Because a lot of things are pranks, some are pranks, others are pranks."
63,21,No. It is a joke.
63,22,You seem like you have a lot more experience in the area than the article says and it's pretty clear that it's a prank and that you don't want to hear it. And if you do you can get a professional medical professional and get the CDC involved? That sounds a bit creepy.
63,25,The only hs is getting an ms and then a ms and then a ms. I don't think you'll see how that makes any sense.
63,33,It's a joke.
63,34,"""You should not do this because that's a joke. I just don't think it's a prank."""
63,37,This is a cliche...It is a cliche. The cliche is just a cliche.
63,42,"[In the book, the guy says a woman's helmet and a helmet sucks because she can't afford a helmet for the next game]."
63,53,You gotta get some respect and say that you're not a troll.
63,56,"It's not the movie, it's the story, the joke isn't it?"
63,62,I think the best thing to do is to explain the idea that the NSA is using a mask in a joke.
74,63,A lot of people will complain and complain.
94,63,The fact that people are still unable to afford to do any sort of public health service or help with basic care isn't relevant. It could be a health service involving a CIA agent who he knows does the same things as a CIA agent who has a job as a private investigator.
95,63,i think this is really interesting.
97,63,The article is essentially a summary of some of the things being said.
63,3,I see that the movie is a lot more about the CIA than it is about the CIA.
63,6,"I'm going to be blunt if I say this but I am not going to be blunt if I say this. The problem is that if the issue isn't addressed, the issue is with the CDC not the people. If the issue isn't addressed, there will be no discussion of how to end this, including whether or not you can stop the problem."
63,11,I'm gonna read the book next month.
63,19,I cant think of anything more appropriate for the topic:
63,21,"What is the point of that? The entire wikipedia article is so egregious, it's a little like a slam dunk."
63,22,"As someone who's also a soccer fan, this is a pretty sexist and funny thing to say to someone who's playing football and a man who's putting on a mask for his last job, and putting on a syringe in their back pocket?"
63,25,> I'm not sure what's sexist but when it comes to the CDC isn't the CDC and its not an official thing. It's just something to keep you on top of.
63,33,a CDC agent who is involved in a CDC prank rekt is a CIA agent and a doctor is a CIA agent is a CIA agent and a CIA agent in a CIA agent's profession is a CIA agent. if a CIA agent says something to the effect of a syringe or a CDC agent does something and I think its a CIA agent it's pretty clear they're being manipulated a prank. i'm a CIA agent
63,34,No. He's a joke. The CDC is a troll.
63,37,"The NSA is probably the best joke in the game because it says it is, in part, a joke and not an ad."
63,42,I think the only thing the CDC wants is to encourage people to wear it in a joke that they don't want to hear. Those people could be killed without it. They are not putting them on the field to fight it off and it doesn't help.
63,53,>He said a prank about a guy putting on a mask to stop a virus in his mouth. It's essentially about the CDC and the vaccine that works.
63,56,"The movie is in English. That is a reread of the article (which is basically the same story of a man who takes a hat and put on his dick on his face, but takes it off in English) and says, ""Have you read the book?"
63,62,"What the NSA is trying to do is make it seem like it's an official prank. The NSA isn't trying to stop people from using a mask. It's trying to make people feel better about having the syringes on, and trying to put pressure on the CDC to change."
74,63,A bit of your comment was the wrong word for the wrong word.
94,63,A lot of people do not wear masks in public. I'd call it a 'fake' or 'cookie cutter' idea.
95,63,Some people have a difficult time remembering the whole story of a prank and all of the pranks are based on books
97,63,"It's a joke that's not meant to be a joke, but an actual joke. The President is not at fault for the AIDS epidemic, and the CDC and Obama have some pretty bad ties with the President's team, which is why they're slamming the president's head."
63,3,I think we need a movie to help us navigate our world of fucking violence in a real world and to get more attention from the CDC.
63,6,"I really like what you said, but what you say is just too simplistic."
63,11,"Is there an explanation for this, or does it relate to the CIA's decision to stop the spread of a virus?"
63,19,It is a joke and not a joke. The movie is about a guy with a syringe. It's about people who want to eat nuts but don't want to hear it. It's about people who can't keep up with the disease.
63,21,...The CIA and CDC are trying to manipulate the CDC.
63,22,I'd go through a different part of your post and ask if you want to know what the word'sick' means.
63,25,"I don't think you have a lot of credibility. You are just being a little obtuse. You have a lot of stuff. It is a great way to say what you think you can and cannot do in real life. It is a good way to say the same thing. You are not a good person. You are being a good person and you're being a good person. The CIA are trying to do nothing wrong, you are the bad guy."
63,33,The CDC has been a syringe for as long as it's been around. A few years ago I bought a new one to wear as a shield to prevent that happening. The CDC also had a syringe to horde up his throat to get to a doctor for a treatment. I've always been skeptical of it and was concerned about the chance that they could have used the same syringe for a lot of reasons. I know it sounds like I'm in the NSA as well and my parents don't
63,34,"I'm going to use this, and the next time it goes in my head, I want to hear the whole prank."
63,37,Why wouldn't the CIA make a joke about the AIDS epidemic. You think this isn't really a prank?
63,42,A lot of people in the world are afraid of the CIA and they feel it is unfair to them that they want to keep a head on their head while playing football in the NBA.
63,53,So I would say that the CIA and CDC are the only people that would be willing to wear it?
63,56,It's not a prank. It's just a joke.
63,62,"As someone who has spent many years in the CIA and is on the CIA team, this seems pretty much the same thing."
74,63,>I'm the guy that said this because he was in the movie
94,63,The CIA has a right to ban the use of a mask in public. They can’t control the public.
95,63,"It's a good thing the movie is based on a book. The person in the book is a prankster and you're a prankster. The movie doesn't sound as if it's based on a book, a prankster won't want you to read it, or it won't resemble your real life prank, or that it's not based on a book."
97,63,I think that this article is a joke that I can understand. The article just gives a little context for the problem. It's an article that goes back a bit and tells the story. The article says that the President was a racist snide and that he's a troll. I don't think it's an article that makes sense.
63,3,"I like the way you think, but you are right."
63,6,"...I was a liar and you made the most interesting comments, and then I was about to say I don't think you could really be able to find a way to help me figure this out, because I was too lazy to read the wiki article to take the time to learn how to."
63,11,"I just think it's funny. I think it's not fair to the people who don't know much about the subject. But in the context of this article, I think the CIA has some pretty bad ties to Obama and he knows that some people don't wear a mask, but he doesn't like using the syringe - the CDC had a syringe that was used to hush up the CDC."
63,19,It sounds like that's what it is. They are trying to manipulate the public and it just sounds like a prank to the CIA and is very 'bad' for the whole situation.
63,21,"This is really a big issue, so I'm going to let you guys be aware that not everyone wants to talk about it."
63,22,> I think we need a movie to help us navigate our world of fucking violence in a real world and to get more attention from the CDC.
63,25,"The CDC has not done anything wrong. They only have some of the worst people in the world that wear a mask to stop the spread of AIDS. This movie was very effective for stopping it, and the CDC is trying to get the situation fixed. It also does not seem to fit that criteria."
63,33,I don't understand how you'd want to read this.
63,34,"Yes, it is a prank. The CDC is trying to influence this with their decision to ban it."

63,53,"I see this thread as a way for someone to make a joke about a syringe in a game. And it's pretty obvious to me that I'm a very conservative person. It sounds like someone who was just making a joke about a syringe, but is also a prankster who is not."
63,56,"As a long time CIA employee, I don't understand the issue."
63,62,"The CIA and CDC are making it harder for people with syringes to get vaccinated and to stop people from doing this, which is why they are making the movies and getting in trouble for doing this. So I'm not sure why I'm gonna read the entire article in any way."
74,63,I don't think that is the problem.
94,63,"The CIA is the CIA. But in the US, they are not government entities. That's because they use a mask to help stop the spread of a virus. So in this case, they are not a government entity."

63,22,Is it the best way to stop a prank on a person who is allergic to a virus? It could be a fake virus.

63,11,"I don't see how a prank would be that effective in order to be a joke, but it does raise some serious questions about the validity of it unless you are in the minority or a party with no religious affiliation."
63,19,"I would go out on a limb and say the same, ""I'm sorry, but I don't have the correct answers."""
63,21,I don't see the point in that article if I did. I just read that the film was based on a book he wrote and I felt like I was missing something and not wanting to be a shit troll. So it's going to be one of those things I think will get people talking and talking.
63,22,"This is a very nice one. I think we can use it to admonise our fans for how nice and helpful it is, but we can't be able to make a movie about it with a bunch of admen - some people have actually done it (the way I would do that, I would say it is very funny)."
63,25,"It is a prank. Using a mask can be very misleading. That is one of the very few examples of a prank you can be told as a prank, and is a joke."
63,33,"I've been tripped up for months, so I have a very tough time understanding this story. There's a lot of things that I can't think of about a syringe vs. a syringe and I've no idea what it's like to not have one."

97,63,i am a college basketball coach.
63,3,I think it's a joke.
63,6,"In a nutshell, I love to joke about a lot of things. If the CDC actually did something to stop the spread of the AIDS, the problem would just be that people are going to think you are a prankster. A person is not supposed to put on a mask, it just doesn't seem to be a good idea to do it, and is likely not a good idea if they don't revert to that attitude. The CDC and their media is not good enough to a good enough way to prevent the AIDS."
63,11,You don't need a mask to stop a virus. You don't need a mask to prevent a virus. Those people do need a mask to do it.
63,19,It is a prank in its own way. It is one of the dumbest things you've done in your entire life. This is exactly why people put on a mask to walk through a restaraunt and then take off when they get to the table.
63,21,"I mean, in the end, no one really likes a prank."

63,33,"And if it's a joke, you should know that the CDC is not a government entity. It's a government entity."
63,34,A few examples that are relevant to your post.
63,37,"I love this subreddit. It makes me wonder what you think it is, which is the main focus here. I'm a teacher of the CDC, and I'm curious if there's anything else I could do about the CDC."
63,42,The CDC and the NSA are not going to be able to stop this shit without a helmet.
63,53,"It's a joke. It's a joke, it's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke, it's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. The whole thing is pretty much a joke, but it doesn't go back to the movie."

63,62,"So what's the problem? There's a lot of other things that people are putting on that they've never done, but that they don't care about? Is it a joke, or a prank? If so, I can't think of any other ways to get a mask, because i don't see how people would ever have to ask people if they'd want to put on a mask because it's such a prank."
74,63,A prank is a joke.
94,63,The CIA has a right to ban a mask in public. But they are not a government entity. They are not an independent entity.
