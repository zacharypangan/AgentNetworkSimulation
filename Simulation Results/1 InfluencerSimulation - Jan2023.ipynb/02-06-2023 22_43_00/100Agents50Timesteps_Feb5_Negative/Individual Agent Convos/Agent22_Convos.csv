22,12,"I'd like to bring up that I can't wear a mask because a few days later my wife was doing just that. I mean a lot of other people are going to wear them, and the idea of the government preventing people from flying is pretty much the same."
22,17,"I think they mean to say, We need to start wearing masks if we want to avoid the public health issue."
23,22,We have a policy regarding wearing a mask. It prevents people from traveling and being vaccinated with a vaccine. The policy does not permit the public to drive to the university in a mask or helmet. It allows it to be worn while a public health department is going to be out of the country.
45,22,"I suck at politics. The fact that I have a job means that I get to coach the people I support. If it were me, I would be able to wear whatever helmet they want to. That being said, I really don't want to go."
51,22,"I think the greatest thing for you to do right now is start a coalition of people who firmly oppose the government. And then get your wife out. That's a good idea, if ya know it. I think it's time to give this guy a try, and see how he responds."
58,22,I have never been kicked out of a game for wearing a mask. I do know the practice to do. I can wear a helmet while I'm playing and wear it for an hour.
59,22,I think it's the best way to stop the spread of a virus. I think it's not a good way to stop a clot from spreading to someone's body.

23,22,This is what the government is trying to do when the government gets into it?
45,22,Vaccination Act is the most important thing of all to be taken into consideration. Why the fuck does the government have to take care of your own safety? I feel like the word mask is too presumptuous for people who like their job. It would be bad.
51,22,"I hate this man, he has a problem. I've been a sick man for nearly three years."
58,22,"So your job requires you to wear a mask, and if you're not an authority in the US, I can see why this could be a very dangerous thing."

63,22,I'm also a woman who is allergic to my helmet. The first thing that came to mind was wearing a mask for my last job when I was about ten.

90,22,"The current fucking health care system isn't doing anything to stop it, either. It's just a way to show that people are gonna need to get a sick mask or die, so that we can't get sick without it. That is not an acceptable response to someone having a health issue like HIV."

23,22,A mask is not a mandatory form of immunisation. A person wearing one can be banned from attending a public health event without getting vaccinated and not wearing it.
45,22,"I don't think he's an incredibly smart person. He's a man who doesn't have much time to get used to being a bad person. If the president is in a bad position, then why do they cite him as the one who is going to get a good shot at his job? The idea of a president wearing a mask is nonsense."
51,22,This is on the top of my top five lists.
58,22,"[I don't think it's funny that you're being a very stupid person... Besides the fact that you're having trouble in the system, I think you're very stupid."
59,22,Vaccination is NOT a nitpick. The government wants to prevent HIV transmission.
63,22,"When you're playing a sport like football, you can't tell if a person is going to play or not. People are going to do the same thing to the world. I'm a very experienced athlete and my husband plays both soccer and football. I have never seen a man on the court. I can tell you from experience that the only difference in a person's experience is their ability to think on his feet and he is not a very good player. I can say for sure the only difference between wearing a syringe and the other team are in"
72,22,It's a government mandate.
84,22,The word is a joke.
85,22,"I thought the article was accurate at all, I think it's a very poor interpretation of the post. I think the author was trying to imply that the state is not allowed to have the disease control program, so they should try to make it very clear. No way, OP."
86,22,"It is ridiculous to talk about the masks, but I believe that a lot of people don't know how to use them. The president can still wear a mask, it just isn't appropriate."
88,22,There's no evidence of the person who is a TB and STIs fan being vaccinated despite a good vaccine if the vaccine was on the market today.
90,22,I'd say it's an unacceptable response to people who have a health issue. It seems like the government is in the middle of a campaign to stop it.

22,17,The first thing I thought when I saw that post was the fact that a fad and shit he said was that a fake mask was a joke.
23,22,This is a joke involving the government of Georgia (which is where OOC is from) about a fact based on a movie. They are trying to cover up the truth with a different story.
45,22,If you want to be a president you need a helmet. It doesn't need to be worn while working.

84,22,I see why you hate that one.
85,22,I don't know about this – I like being out there with my dog to protect himself. I'm from Georgia and this article makes me think it's in line with a hat-trick of anti-HIV rhetoric.
86,22,I think it is reasonable for the president to wear a mask to help stop the spread of a virus. Putting on a mask is what is called a mask. That is not a normal mask. The mask is also considered protection for those who need it.

63,22,It's an interesting question. Is that a misunderstanding? What kind of mask?
72,22,"The person in the picture who said, 'I'm confused why people are calling the people who had their noses ripped open in the US, in this case a rat.' I think he was saying, ""You can if you want, you can also try to make it a crime to use a mask to prevent SARS."""

The article says it's a question of what is being discussed in that context and it's not an enshrinement of anti-HIV sentiment, but the term 'ignorance' has some value because it implies that the'shady' is the defining word and a statement. I believe there are a number of articles claiming that a person's viewpoint can be used to defend a person's beliefs,"
86,22,I think we are all very ignorant about this topic. The whole r/health thing just makes you realize how ridiculously naive or deluded it is. I'm just curious if any people have a problem with this.
88,22,> It's been a while since I've seen it. I'm just saying that people on this sub are sometimes confused when people say I don't want to be vaccinated.

51,22,It's interesting that the NSA has made that statement. It seems a lil'sleazy way of telling you it's wrong. It's a funny and stupid way of saying it.
