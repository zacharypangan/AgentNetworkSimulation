72,17,I don't like wearing a mask so much but I do think there is a way you can tell if you have something similar on people in your area.
72,22,"What if it was the flu that took over the US, but a lot of people have had their nose ripped open because of their facial expressions? oh man you should come to Georgia it s like people here think wearing a mask gives them covid there s so few oh man you should come to Georgia it s like people here think wearing a mask gives them covid there s so few oh man you should come to Georgia it s like people here think wearing a mask gives them covid there s so few oh man you should"
72,23,They could probably make a joke about it and then post it on the Internet.
72,36,"I'm not sure why the government wants you to have to wear a mask. If you want to go to a place you're at, you're going to need a mask. But don't wear a mask in a public place. If you go to a city, you're going to need a mask to go to an airport. Then you will get into the hood and have to wear your mask to get into a cafeteria."
72,40,i m a lawyer and i want to go back to georgia for a job to do it
72,44,"a mask has to be on when you can walk through a restaraunt, as if you need to be able to do that."

72,70,"OP is a politician, not a legislator, not a doctor."
74,72,Oh my god I have never been able to breathe properly since having to wear a mask. I don't think I'm able to breathe without it. I feel like it is really too hard to just put a mask on because of some sort of infection.
80,72,> I love coaching however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops.

72,11,"I think it's good you are trying to be a lawyer, and a bit too sensitive about your situation to want to have your work done."
72,12,What I feel is most important about the current government is that people with a mask can not wear a mask. And they do not have to wear a mask to get into the office.
72,13,Those are not facts. This is a part of what makes the US a superpower and not an evil one.
72,17,"I don't really believe that the government was able to prevent this nonsense from happening yet, so I just think it is very dickish of them."
72,22,Why are people wearing a mask in public? It's supposed to be the way to prevent the spread of a virus.

72,70,He was just talking about the fact that the government is helping to prevent a virus from spreading. That is really just nonsense.

81,72,I like the way you're saying it. It’s all about the mask.
85,72,I want to go to Georgia and get vaccinated by wearing a mask.
89,72,One of the dumbest things I have done in my entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i ve done in my entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things i ve done
90,72,"And to add to the fact that the actual virus is contagious, it is called SARS."
72,3,I don't understand why anyone would want to get a mask.
72,5,>I'm not against vacks mandates cuz they ruin the economy get people fired and people should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force
72,9,You're not going to be able to convince yourself that people have the power to fight the spread of a virus. Your only argument is that you do not care.
72,11,"I would never wear a mask, and if I did, i'd probably be in jail for committing a crime. But even without a mask, it's not like people in my city are allowed to 'hold a conversation'."
72,12,/u/pwww1ewdjsybnozbd? They are so wrong. They should be made to go back to their homes.
72,13,"It would be interesting to get a doctor to testify against the fact that this is the case in Georgia, but I doubt it's actually a good thing. It may help to show up in the mail, but it's a good thing that it is not the case."
72,17,"You can if you want, you can also try to make it a crime to use a mask to prevent SARS. That's ridiculous and disrespectful to the government, and in your opinion."
72,22,"I'm a lawyer and you need to be vaccinated. This is a government mandate. If it's going to help you, you have to be honest, it's not a government mandate."

72,36,"That's why a tv show that's on TV doesn't have any actual facts to back up its claims about people in the US being able to keep a public health awareness system, and that the government is helping to stop the spread of a virus."

You can't say it, it's just your personal opinion."
72,44,I think this is very egregious to me.
72,48,"It's a stupid issue, but it's absolutely an issue. People have no right to have a mask. I don't think the mask is something we can do as long as we have a proper mask, I think it's the only option."
72,51,"In this case it's not possible to keep a'machete' from spreading in your home, you're allowed to wear a mask. So the people who want to wear a mask need to find ways to get vaccinated."
72,54,They're trying to delegitimize the power of the people. They're doing it.
72,59,"I don't think the government is able to prevent this nonsense from happening yet, because I just feel like people who say he can't be there for his own benefit will get hurt by it. It's just that when he says he can't wear a mask he's trying to do a very bad job because it's not what he wants to do. It's not what it says to the host."
72,70,"'Oh man you should come to Georgia it s like people here think wearing a mask gives them covid there s so few', 'OP is a politician, not a legislator, not a doctor.'"
74,72,"I've always said that because when I was younger, I felt that I didn't really like wearing a mask and that was the kind of thing I did in high school. I never thought about wearing a mask because I didn't know anything about the science of what it was, and I didn't want to go on an adventure in a world where someone else would have that."

81,72,"My friend and I did something similar. I was in my room and the whole thing was a shitshow, and everyone was super nice and chatty. The only way to avoid getting attacked is with some shitshow. Then we went down a street and we were unable to get anywhere. The next day we got arrested for walking down a street."
85,72,That explains a lot of the reasons he wore a mask. The government has been helping stop the spread of a virus since the 1700s. They do not support the new system.
89,72,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
90,72,"It's not a shit ton of people who've never seen it before and haven't, but it's an indication of something that's been a bit bad lately. It doesn't necessarily sound like it's something to be concerned about, it's just that they're wasting their time and effort in the process."
72,3,"... and the US government wants it in the future, which is actually the US and isn't. So we should definitely stop doing it, if you are going to be in a safe situation, go to the CDC. They are very likely to put a massive ban on using masks and in the future they will have a big job"
72,5,"CANNOTANSWER: When we try to stop a virus, we are in a state where the population of a country is so low that some countries are not going to stop a virus from spreading. We are not supposed to prevent it from spreading. That said, if we do, we should try to stop it."
72,9,I agree that wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

72,12,"The article mentions that this is an issue not in itself, but in fact that the government is actually attempting to stop the spread of the virus."
72,13,They're wasting their time and effort in the process. It's just that they're wasting their time and effort.
72,17,I can't think of a more appropriate reason to be against any government mandate than they have.
72,22,It's a government mandate.
72,23,"It's an issue of safety, not an issue of health. It's one of the only things that actually bothers me about being in a position to avoid the spread of SARS. It's an issue of public health. And I'm glad this is not one of those things."
72,36,"I don't understand how these BS movies can be so damaging. They would be horrible if they did that to people, they'd just have to go back to their homes. Basically what they do is a good thing for them."
72,40,"I mean I mean the joke is so cheesy and insulting. The mask is not a good thing, it's just a shit thing, it's not the most evil thing ever. It's like a joke."
72,44,/u/pww1ewdjsybnozbd? They are so wrong. They should be made to go back to their homes.
72,48,"I mean, if you had never seen it, I'd be incredibly uncomfortable with it."
72,51,I've been out of this hysteria for a few years. It's been a lot of fun to go see a TV documentary. It's the best part about that.
72,54,It's a shame that a federal agency doesn't have the resources to adequately do everything they can to prevent the spread of the virus. They are also using false information and are making things worse.
72,59,It's an indicator of something that's been a bit bad lately.
72,70,"I'm the one that makes up the fact that this isn't the case, but I think there's some truth in the way people are construing it:"
74,72,"There's a lot of stupid jokes, but the ones that are thrown around in the comments are all hilarious. It would be cool to know that you have a rat in your mouth and then see if anyone else will take it."
80,72,"I don't know if this is legal, but I do know it's a crime. It's a crime, not a law. It's not something the government can and should be doing, unless its in violation of the anti-virus law."

89,72,"I was thinking that the whole thing was a bad idea and that they're just using the wrong word to explain it. This is a good point, it's a joke.

72,11,It's a joke  the government is trying to prevent the spread of a virus
72,12,It sounds like the government is going to take a very very dangerous approach to the SARS virus epidemic.

72,23,"This is a weird topic that isn't even related to the discussion at all.

They would be horrible if they did that to people, they'd just have to go back to their homes. Basically what they do is a good thing for them. I mean, if you had never seen it, I'd be incredibly uncomfortable with it."

72,40,"It is a funny way to think about it. I do have a photo of the guy wearing a mask, but I'm a rat enthusiast and I would prefer to avoid putting on my mask."

72,51,"Considering the fact that the mask is actually part of the measures deployed by the government, it doesn't surprise me that they're not going to change their course."

80,72,"I don't like the NSA, but it's a crime in the US."
81,72,"The NSA is a scary thing, a huge threat in my opinion."
85,72,"'I'm not surprised, I think you're very kind. And you are the first to tell my govt to stop wearing a mask, just like their government. I'm an anti-HIV nut, and you are the first to tell my govt to stop wearing a mask, just like their government. I'm not surprised, I think you're very kind."
89,72,"I think the joke is kind of ambiguous, but is probably in good enough of a place to make sense of the situation. If you're like me, I would get a little more excited and start thinking about how it might end up being something that I could potentially do in my day. I'm not trying to say I should actually fuck around with my mask, I am just trying to understand why people have a better understanding of the problem than I do."
90,72,"A big issue is the way they have been dealing with the ACA, but they're not just about a mask."
72,3,If you look into the details of the article you will see that some people are actually saying it's a joke the government is actually trying to stop the spread of a virus. I think it is the first one to see the issue as an important point.
72,5,"No, we are a joke. Those people were trying to talk out the SARS epidemic, which is really a great idea to bring back."
72,9,There's the problem of people coming out of their seats and they're being lied to about it.
72,11,They fucking have to go.
72,12,I don't think that's a joke and it doesn't make sense.
72,13,"i am not going to lie to you, but the NSA has been doing a lot of depressing things because of its behavior. i dont know how they're going to do that because it's not a reputable health center. i don't know how to deal with a virus in the states. i can't really tell if it is just a joke but that it is a narcissistic thing to do"
72,17,"Trying to make a joke about the government isn't an indictment, and I think it's a joke."
72,22,"I think I'm going to have to agree with the other commenters: If I was in the US I'd have a little more experience than the other members of the US government, but I'm not sure the same people in the US would have had enough experience to make the comparison."
72,23,It's also funny that a post I saw about a rat on facebook was made that was kind of related to the hysteria. The joke was just that the rat had been shot in the head and not a lot of other people thought about it and asked him what it was. He responded that his govt was going to stop doing it but this was a joke. I think it's interesting that the hysteria has become less and less relevant to the issue as a whole because if you haven't seen this movie before you think
72,36,">I'm the one that makes up the fact that this is a bad idea. I mean I mean the joke is so cheesy and insulting. The mask is not a good thing, it's just a shit thing, it's not the most evil thing ever. It's weird."

72,44,"""I'm not against the government. They are going to take a very very dangerous approach to the SARS virus epidemic."
72,48,... I can't figure out why it was even said in the first place.
72,51,"People don't think the mask is the only solution to SARS. The virus is being spread in public and private, while people don't believe that people with masks are going to get SARS."
72,54,"In an interview with the Guardian, the NSA argues that the mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of the virus."
72,59,It doesn't seem like the article cites anything else about the NSA or the article.
72,70,ahh ahhhh ok
74,72,">Is it the government? It's the government. If you don't wear a mask to keep the virus away from you, you can't buy one."
80,72,That s a real question. How can they make a legitimate point about the dangers of the NSA?
81,72,Why is the guy wearing a mask a threat to America?
85,72,Vaccination is a great idea but it's not what it was meant to be. Is it okay for the president to wear a mask?
89,72,"OP, I'm going to be on my own."
90,72,"I'm a guy, and the first thing that came to my mind when I saw the movie is the mask. I don't understand what people think. I've never seen it. I'm just sad."
72,3,"I'm a man, and the first thing that came to my mind when I saw this movie is the mask. I don't know why people think that it's a joke, but I don't think it makes sense, especially since the hysteria was so bad that the president had to go."
72,5,It seems to me that this movie is in a very strange place. There's so many things to know about in the movie that it's ridiculously difficult to imagine how someone would have felt if he hadn't been in the movie. It's been like this for decades.
72,9,This movie has become more relevant in recent months and will become more and more relevant in the future.
72,11,"What is this? ""Oops, I saw the hysteria and I don't understand why people think this is a joke""."
72,12,>Is it okay for the president to wear a mask?
72,13,I think you're getting your points in here:
72,17,"I would just put a few paragraphs apiece into a paragraph and say something like ""You're going to have to agree with the other commenters: If I were in the US I'd have a little more experience than the other members of the US government.""

74,72,The CDC wants the movie to be about the CDC and the government. I think the movie will be better than that and you won't get sick from the movie.

81,72,There are people who don't wear masks as part of the AIDS epidemic.
85,72,"I don't know how to translate it, but you say that I'm being criticized, even in Australia. I just want to be clear."
89,72,"That's pretty awful. But at the same time, this is probably one of the dumbest things I've ever done in my entire life."
90,72,"I don't understand the whole movie, which is kind of sarcastic."
72,3,This is a very basic question.
72,5,"What is wrong with this movie? Are you saying that if it's a satire, then it is a satire, not an ad hominem."
72,9,"I can't say that the movie is ""so bad that I've seen it"""
72,11,I don't understand why you think it's a good idea for the CDC to make a joke about it. It's one of the dumbest things you've ever done in your entire life.
72,12,"I don't think that's a funny joke, because it's one of the many'miserable jokes' that's so common amongst people."

72,23,You need to go read the rest of the comment thread. The movie is not about the AIDS issue.
72,36,"It's weird and sexist. It's not a joke, it's a joke."
72,40,Then you gonna go eat my soup.

72,51,The CDC wants the movie to be about the CDC and the government. I would say the movie will be better than that and you won't get sick from the movie.
72,54,CANNOTANSWER: There are people who don't wear masks as part of the AIDS epidemic.
72,59,This is not a joke. It's just a satire.
72,70,"The CDC is going to use a mask in a movie about how the AIDS epidemic is becoming more and more serious. It could potentially be better, but it would also be more fun for the audience to have fun in the movie."
74,72,"...which is a satire of the book, not a movie?"
80,72,We will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops.
81,72,Is this the same way I think he is referring to some amputation?
85,72,"I think the point of that is not to be perceived as a ""great coach"" for the president."
89,72,> I was thinking that the whole thing was a bad idea and that they're just using the wrong word to explain it.
90,72,"I mean, a lot of the time it's just a satire of the government."
72,3,"In other words, the idea of the presidential election is not going to come up."
72,5,"The idea that this satire is a satire of the CDC seems to me like a symptom of ""the CIA in a worse way than we know"""
72,9,I know a lot of cdc staff and their managers aren't well versed in what their role is. My dad works in a healthcare facility and is a senior at the CDC.
72,11,It's a joke. You've read the wikipedia article and it doesn't make sense to me.
72,12,The CDC is going to wear a mask in the movie about the AIDS epidemic.
72,13,I've seen a few of those jokes and i can tell you I'm wrong. I'm more of a fan of the movies that are a little rhyming and I really like the premise of the movie.
72,17,"What a great comment. I'll add it to my short list of people who say a hat is a problem, it's stupid, it's funny, and it's ridiculous. It's pretty much a ""no joke"" and it's so blatantly absurd. Mostly, sexist and a joke but I'll say it because I'm sure the other people are probably just as stupid and it's not like the other commenters are just saying a joke about the problem, not to mention that the problem is that the government is"
72,22,What a mess of a joke. Its not a satire. It is not a joke. Its not a movie.
72,23,I was going to put this on the top of my head but I couldn't find the context.
72,36,"The CDC has to be more than an agent to stop the spread of an AIDS. They're only sending a few of those to Georgia, so no one's gonna get sick."
72,40,"You think I'm an idiot, and I feel stupid for not knowing what the actual context is?"
72,44,So... what is a joke? It's a joke. It's a satire.
72,48,> I know that I didn't say anything.
72,51,CANNOTANSWER:
72,54,"It's pretty obvious that people with an AIDS-related mental illness can make a joke. In the US there is not such thing as a ""so many people with AIDS who do it"". Is this what you're getting at? A ""so many people"" comment is what the joke is. I was actually going to ask, ""Why can't you tell me that I'm wrong?"" And that the joke is ""Then you go eat my soup."
72,59,This is a satire of the CDC's 'hysterical and offensive' joke.
72,70,"... Which is a satire of the book, not a movie?"
74,72,The movie is about a government that is actually a government. This is a very good example of how the Obama administration has dealt with the healthcare system.
80,72,I don't think you're making the right point.
81,72,"I'm not trying to take you down, I'm just trying to explain the idea."
85,72,Vaccination is a great idea but it's not what it was meant to be. Is it okay for the president to wear a mask?
89,72,People wear masks to stop the spread of a virus. I don't see any reason why I couldn't walk and the guy who said it was a joke. People wear hats to prevent people from being able to walk like that. The guy who said it was a joke. I thought it was a sarcastic joke. It's kind of a dick joke because it doesn't make sense in a good way. I think the other comments are coming from people who don't have a hat.
90,72,Is there anything in the movie that is actually related to this?
72,3,"I'm not saying this is a joke. Regardless of what you're asking, the CDC is a sexist, racist, and sexist organization. They are not allowed to ban such an act. I think the problem is that it is not just a sexist joke."
72,5,I was in a hysterical mood about how people got all angry about people wearing masks and how they did it.
72,9,">I'm ashamed to say, but I do think the most obvious thing is that the government is doing what is necessary to prevent the spread of a virus."
72,11,"They don't know what to do about the joke, and it isn't the right thing to do."
72,12,"Its not about the disease, it's about the'medical advances'."
72,13,"In the United States we can't have a government who isn't a government. If we enact an AIDS epidemic it will be a joke, but we can't have the government who is doing that and the AIDS isn't really a disease."
72,17,So the first joke in this thread about the CDC?
72,22,"It’s actually a great movie, but it doesn’t sound too funny. There’s also the joke that the president should get sick from being the person wearing a mask."
72,23,"This movie is about a hysterical, sexist joke in which the author has admitted that it doesn't make sense, and doesn't say anything about a ""whole bunch"" of comments about a sexist joke."
72,36,CANNOTANSWER:
72,40,"It's a satire of a book that was made into a movie about the AIDS epidemic, and the people with AIDS are the one who make it into a movie about a dick joke."
72,44,You should try and find the source.
72,48,There are many people who think wearing a mask is a good thing because it is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of the virus.
72,51,"It's one of my favorite things to do when I'm not traveling, and it's really funny to watch it. It's a really good movie, if only to get people to stop hating."
72,54,"I’m not saying it’s a joke, I’m saying that people with a mental illness can make funny things and are able to communicate well with each other, and the CDC has to be more than just an agent to stop the spread of AIDS. It doesn’t make sense that a federal agency can’t have the resources to adequately do everything they can to stop the spread of AIDS. They’re also using false information and are making things worse. I think that’s kind of how it works."
72,59,"""The president doesn't need a mask to stay safe because it's a joke."""
72,70,"I like to call jokes ""sad jokes."" They're sarcastic because they are satires."
74,72,I'm not a doctor. This has to be a doc question. I read an article on The US Government and I have no idea what it is. It is about the federal government and the healthcare system.
80,72,I think you are missing the point of this thread.
81,72,"I believe that the president has no obligation to do it in the future, and is very concerned about the health care system."
85,72,"I don't like the idea, but I'd like to know what a little more interesting it would be to see a woman on a mask, but I'm going to have to say I just don't want to hear ""shawn about that"". It would be too easy to make up."
89,72,I thought that was funny. It's a prank. I know what it is.
90,72,i have to go. i just finished reading a book about the health care system.
72,3,"In general, the health care system is one of the main things to get a head start on."
72,5,"""Making fun of this guy"""
72,9,I can understand why people are trying to laugh at these jokes and find the jokes funny. They are satire. I just can't understand them. I can understand how someone is able to make up the jokes.
72,11,"The joke is about an AIDS epidemic, not the health care system. The doctor on the mask is wearing a mask."
72,12,The CDC is doing a 'comedian'' job to stop the spread of AIDS. It's doing it to fight the virus. The government is using a mask to try and stop it.

72,40,I thought this was a really good joke.
72,44,"I read this in a wikipedia article, and it makes you think I'm being facetious."
72,48,It's also a satire of the CDC. I know they're not getting much attention.
72,51,The article is the only one with any real substance. I'm not saying it's funny.
72,54,"They do not have the resources to be able to do the necessary things to stop the spread of the virus. They are using false information and are making things worse. Regardless, this is the worst joke in history and a great film."
72,59,It's a satire of a book about the AIDS epidemic and the CDC's 'hysterical and offensive' joke.
72,70,"In my opinion, I'm not even a doctor, I just like to think that the CDC has the resources to use the movie (or any of its 'properties' to help stop the spread of AIDS)."
74,72,"OP's comment in response to the comments made by a bunch of ""cynical idiots"" is not really true."

85,72,I see this in a lot of posts and some people in this sub are not being serious.
89,72,"I think it's a joke because people don't like to talk about the stuff in general. I mean, 'you're not saying I'm going to be on my own' is a joke. I'm talking about the hat thing. I mean, you are not going to be able to talk about the joke's meaning if you haven't seen it before."
90,72,"You can see how the author is being a troll in the movie. This is what happens when a person says ""Wheeeeeeeee! "". I read the book and the movie and I understand the implication."
72,3,"I'm trying to help you out, but I'm not sure how to find anything better."
72,5,There is an article about a joke about people wearing masks that is so well written by a CDC doctor that he had no idea that they were wearing a mask and that the CDC is using false information to stop the spread of AIDS.

72,22,I'm sorry I had to read this. This movie doesn't seem to be satire at all. The CDC is trying to do something akin to the movie.
72,23,A good satire about the AIDS virus is a great movie.

72,44,Well I guess you should be able to get yourself a haircut and a mask to protect yourself from the CDC's attempts to stop the spread of AIDS.

''The Doctor''' was a doctor in the 1990s and it was a joke and is essentially a joke about the Obama administration's handling of the AIDS crisis. This movie and the joke had a lot of good lines and a lot of little subs, and the CDC's AIDS scandals had a big impact on people'''"
74,72,I feel like the joke is not so much that it doesn't even fit the topic.
80,72,What a stupid and stupid joke.
81,72,"Yes, the president is a faggot. So if he did say a hat, he would have said: ""We wear it to fight the flu."" It's a joke if you think the guy wearing a mask is a threat to the US - which would not be true of him."

72,3,"The fact that a hat is considered a joke is more disturbing than the fact that the CDC is trying to stop the spread of a virus. This movie has absolutely nothing to do with the CDC. It does a little bit of work, but the idea of putting on a mask in a safe situation is completely different."
72,5,A virtuous racist troll is a sexist joke.
72,9,"We need to get the public to go to the CDC and be more concerned about the epidemic, I find this so funny."

74,72,I don't know what you're referring to. There's just no point in having to be a doctor to get people sick and not know about a thing. This is the moral issue. It's not a joke. It's about the government and the healthcare system. The hat is just a joke.

72,48,"Considering that the whole thing is a satire of the government, I don't think there are any people who think it's wrong to wear a mask to prevent the spread of AIDS. The movie is based on facts, not the film, and it's a joke."
72,51,"It's a good movie, if only to get people to stop hating."

74,72,My friend was in the movie and the guy was really cool.
80,72,What's the point of saying the NSA has to stop the spread of a virus?
81,72,"I would have a lot of respect for him. But this is not a joke, just a little bit of a prank."
85,72,"He didn't wear the mask, he just decided that it would be a joke. The question is: Is it okay for the president to wear a mask?"
89,72,People wear hats to stop people from being able to walk like that. The guy who said it was a prank.
90,72,This is a good one because of the actors and the acting is a good one. They're both genuinely interested in the movie.
72,3,It's funny and doesn't make sense. It's a joke.
72,5,"I like a good movie, but this premise is just too weak."
72,9,"You have some really good points. This movie is pretty good. Having a mask makes me think the movie is pretty funny. Yes. The first one is pretty funny. Yes. The first one is a prank, the third one is a joke. ""A lot of people do not understand that AIDS is one of the reasons for many deaths. You are probably going to be more of a joke then anyone else. And we are just talking a hat to prevent the spread of a virus."""

72,13,"It's about the pranks of the government. The AIDS vaccines have been known to get people to stop talking to the AIDS victims. There is an article in the Journal of Public Health that says that it will get people to stop talking to the AIDS patients and that AIDS is not a virus, just a prank."
72,17,"The guy who said it was a joke. I didn't realize a prank was part of it, he was in the movie because he thought it was a prank and he figured he was in the movie because he didn't have a full history of that sort of thing."

72,59,There are three types of AIDS pranks:
72,70,I just read your whole point and thought you are a funny fucking guy that is just not a doctor and not a doctor.
74,72,>I have had so much trouble with the neocon propaganda because of a stupid movie.
80,72,"It doesn't mean he shouldn't play video games unless it is against the anti-virus law. It means it isn't a crime to allow a person to use a mask, and it isn't something that government should be doing unless it is in violation of the anti-virus law."
81,72,"It doesn't matter what people think about the situation. But if the shitshow is true, that is a lot of shit."
85,72,What if a man was wearing a mask and went to a museum to get vaccinated? No.
89,72,It sounds like someone is doing a good job of this.
90,72,"I want to thank you for your thoughtful feedback, but this article says it's not about the movie or the book."
72,3,This is what I came here for. I don't think it's a joke but it's a joke.
72,5,"I mean, I don't care what the movie says, but I think I like that quote, especially if it's in a lot of different contexts."
72,9,It sounds like a really good movie - a good prank in general - but I agree with the author.
72,11,"AIDS is a very pronounced virus, but there is no law that requires that people use a mask to stop the spread of it. Is the CDC trying to stop the spread of the virus through an AIDS prank?"
72,12,"This is a great movie! I know it's very offensive, but this one is absolutely brilliant. It's a comedy, and I will be doing all of it again."
72,13,"The CDC has been doing a lot of things that are depressing. They're saying things about AIDS because it's a good thing for the people that don't get it. I can't see why they are getting the word out, it's just a prank."
72,17,"So you say you like the movie, you like the film?"
72,22,"If you do this, you may want to call yourself an actor."
72,23,"If you've never seen this movie and don't like the movie, you are a sexist racist."
72,36,AIDS is a very serious problem. I really want to know if there are any AIDS related jokes that people who are not AIDS patients and if there are any AIDS-related jokes that are not AIDS related. The CDC should give it a go. It is about the AIDS vaccines that have been known to get people to stop talking to the AIDS patients.
72,40,You're a prank. But what's the point of a prank?
72,44,It sounds like someone is doing a good job of this.
72,48,"There's a CDC episode with a prank that a lot of hysterical, racist, and racist things are going on."
72,51,"""It's a good way to get rid of your own fears about the government is to do the job you have, ect."
72,54,I think you're missing the point here. a few days ago I posted a comment about how a joke is about a joke whose only point is that it's a joke about a prank on a movie.
72,59,"'The president shouldn't wear a mask in public?', 'It's pretty obvious that people with an AIDS-related mental illness can make a joke. In the US there is not such thing as a ""so many people with AIDS who do it""."
72,70,This whole thing is stupid. I think people should go watch this movie.
74,72,"I think the first thing people are asking is to ask, ""Why did you decide to read the article?"""
80,72,This is a great one.
81,72,"I'm a little skeptical of the movie - the two statements they are making here are not that funny. They seem like they are pointing out the truth, which they can't make very well. But I think the whole prank is not a prank, they are talking about AIDS, and it is not an ethical breach of health. It is a prank, and a joke is making the point of it that it's an ethical breach to stop the spread of a virus."
85,72,Vaccination is the best way to stop the spread of HIV.
89,72,The movie is about an idea.
90,72,"In my opinion, a lot of people are satirical and they don't even know why a medical mask is a bad thing. They're blatantly trying to hide a major issue from a mainstream media outlet. They do not know the fact that an ACA has failed to help with AIDS."
72,3,">I don't understand why anyone would want to get a mask. This is a satire of the government.', ""The first two are sexist.', ""... The first two are sexist.' Is this because the health care industry is so inflexible to the fact that a doctor should be wearing a mask in the future, which is actually the US and isn't. So we should definitely stop doing it, if you are going to be in a safe situation,"
72,5,"Yes, the CDC should do something about it. They could be working on a cure for HIV, but they wouldn't be able to do it, if the disease isn't already there. It's only a joke about how they're using a cdc prank to prevent a virus from spreading."
72,9,It's also funny that the movie has been so popular despite the fact it was very funny.
72,11,"Is the ""spider"" about a prank based on a Wikipedia article?"
72,12,"It’s an awesome movie, and it doesn’t make sense."
72,13,"What a prank, the CDC doesn't have the resources to help."
72,17,"I've been using this article for years, and people have said it's funny, it's funny. I just don't think it's good. I was in the movie about the president, but I think it's a joke."
72,22,You have to understand that the CDC is not a satire or a movie.
72,23,...but I think they're trying to hide the fact that a AIDS vaccine does nothing to stop the spread of the virus.
72,36,No one here is going to understand what it's about to be on the fucking national news. They're going to be so upset about that.
72,40,CDC and CDC are making a film about it so they can avoid it.
72,44,This movie was so brilliant I really think this is an interesting one.
72,48,"If people can't see the facts, they're going to be afraid of the CDC."
72,51,'Cannot' is a joke.
72,54,"The movie seems kinda funny, especially with the comment of someone on there complaining about the CDC, who is a big ass bf who is a bigss bf. The first couple lines are definitely a bit confusing for someone who doesn't know that a prank on the CDC is a joke and has no basis in reality."
72,59,They don't have to have a mask in order to stop AIDS from spreading.
72,70,It is a joke if you ask me. I really don't know what s the point of making the jokes.
74,72,"So, you were in the movie and you weren't in the movie."
80,72,"""How can they make a legitimate point about the dangers of the NSA?"", ""What a stupid and stupid joke."
81,72,"And the fact that a person can't be a leader who hasn't been involved in a lot of AIDS incidents, in a way that's clearly not a joke is not just a joke. AIDS is a disease and is a way to control public perception and thereby raise awareness. The idea that it's a joke is not a joke, it's a ploy. The whole idea of wearing a mask is not a joke. The idea of wearing a mask is a joke. It's a joke."
85,72,"I'm an anti-HIV nut, I'm a fan of the shady hating attitude of the President. He is a dick and a hypocrite. I've seen a lot of bad behavior when I was an adult.'''"
89,72,This is a very simple joke. It sounds like you're telling a joke.
90,72,The ACA has been working for years. The ACA should have been implemented by 2008 despite the fact that the ACA is not working because of what happened.
72,3,They don't want the virus. They want to stop it.
72,5,"I don't see the point of the movie. It was a very humorous, humorous movie. What the point was? I think the movie is an interesting one."
72,9,I don't think the ACA would be effective without the AIDS vaccine.
72,11,"The CDC has a right to prevent the spread of a virus - in fact they should have created a mask in order to protect the public. Basically if someone doesn't like wearing a mask, they can sue the government for the cost of removing the mask from the public."
72,12,OP can't agree with the other comments about AIDS.
72,13,"The movie ""Cannot"" is a good one."
72,17,A movie about the president is a joke. It's based on a Wikipedia article and is a joke. It's a joke about it because it is a joke.
72,22,"I mean, there's nothing funny or funny about the CDC prank, but it's a joke about the whole CDC. It's a prank that's supposed to be a way to stop the spread of the virus."
72,23,"""We're not talking about the CDC. We're talking about the president. We're talking about the AIDS vaccine, and how we're talking about how we need to protect the country for what it is""."
72,36,"This is my biggest complaint about the ACA, but this is my biggest complaint about the way the CDC is making jokes."
72,40,">I think it's funny. And the idea of wearing a mask in public ARE committing an ethical breach of health, not a medical one."
72,44,"A new article recently released suggests that the CDC and the CDC have tried to mash the government of AIDS into an improvised version of the joke that we're talking about. The article says the CDC is trying to stop the spread of AIDS by doing so by taking away the NSA from the public.

The CDC is trying to stop the spread of the disease by using it to cut it off and then the person who is a joke is going to"
72,48,The entire movie is based on facts. It's a satire of the government. They are not being directed at people in public. They are being directed at people in public. They are being directed at people that are not being educated. They are looking to be more educated and the public does not feel the same way as them.
72,51,"""...the whole thing is about how hysterical and offensive it's become, and how some people find it very funny."""
72,54,"In general, the government's failures as a whole don't seem very much like the truth. If you're not a lawyer, and you don't care what the CDC does, you don't care about the fact that there's a vaccine for HIV that does nothing to stop the spread of AIDS. It's actually a ploy. It's an awful thing that happened in the 70s, because it's a ploy and not the same thing."
72,59,"I don't get why anyone would ever think he could've gotten into such a serious conversation, but what he does has always been a bad joke."
72,70,I love that these are all things that get told as jokes on the internet and it's one of the only ways to have it's humor.
74,72,It's not funny. It is about a government that isn't a government.
80,72,'The NSA has to stop the spread of a virus.
81,72,"I don't think a prank is anything more than a joke. If a person is wearing a mask to fight AIDS, they can be a threat to people on the other side of the fence. They can be a threat to public perception if they're not already wearing one."
85,72,That's not the point of the article.
89,72,Is there a good movie about the hat?
90,72,"I was reading an article in this thread that talked about a government that's dealing with a serious problem and that has failed. I can't even imagine a situation where they wouldn't have gotten to the bottom of that, but the one they are talking about doesn't seem to be doing anything serious."
72,3,"It doesn't appear that they want to stop a prank or any other form of prank at all. :( I wonder why the CDC would want to be allowed to ban such a thing, but it would be stupid to not do it in a situation like this."
72,5,"If the CDC had decided to send it out to people in public it wouldn't have been a prank, but a joke."
72,9,That's a good way to put it.
72,11,"You don't have to be a lawyer to make a joke about this, it's a joke."
72,12,I have a big problem with people who are afraid that some of the jokes they are utterly wrong.
72,13,The CDC is being a fucking moron! They're letting people put up with the idea that people are coming to the AIDS movie to shit the CDC's foot.

72,59,"A mask doesn't change the way you think, and I think the point of a prank is that people with an AIDS diagnosis have to be aware of it. The government is trying to break the law by using the movie as a prank, 'It's not okay for the president to wear a mask. The whole point of the movie is that it's not a joke. They're trying to delegitimize the power of the people. They're doing it. They're making things worse."

74,72,The whole thing is a joke. The whole idea of a hat is a joke. It isn't a joke. The CDC wants the movie to be about the government and the healthcare system.

74,72,"I don't think there are any issues with the movie or a whole lot of it but if there are, what is the joke?"
80,72,>the mask is a violation of the anti-virus law. It means it isn't a crime to allow a person to use it unless it is against the anti-virus law.
81,72,"I am so embarrassed. I'm in my 70s, and I'm now in my 90s."
85,72,You're not wrong to be harsh because you're wrong. I am the president's first amendment legal successor.
89,72,People wear hats to stop people from having sex without them.
90,72,"Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! We have a prank called ""I love that satire of the government. I love that satire of the government. I love that satire of the government."""
72,3,"... so you're asking why the government would want to ban such a thing, but it would be stupid to not do it in a situation like this."
72,5,It seems like the movie is in a very strange place. There's so many things to know about in the movie that it seems ridiculously difficult to imagine how people would have felt if they hadn't been in the movie.
72,9,"""But I can't understand how someone is able to make up the jokes."""
72,11,If you watch the movie the CDC shouldn't use a mask.
72,12,"I think it's a funny joke, but the shit in the book is that people wear hats and it is a prank and that the movie is a joke?"
72,13,"This is my favorite comment: ""I think it's a joke, but it's also not the right thing to do. This movie makes sense because it can get people to stop talking to AIDS victims because it's a good idea."
72,17,There's a movie called the Mask on the Earth that's hilarious and satirical.
72,22,"This is a great movie, but it doesn’t sound funny."
72,23,"""In my book 'The Hiding Man' is a funny satire '. The author has admitted that it doesn't make sense, and doesn't say anything about a ""whole bunch"" of comments about a sexist joke.'"
72,36,"I think it's pretty funny because it's funny but doesn't really make sense at all. I'd think if it were a joke, it would be considered a joke, and would give a very interesting look into what a hat is."
72,40,It's a prank and a joke.
72,44,"The movie is a great one. It's an interesting story, but it's not a joke."
72,48,"It is the one thing I enjoy most about the movie, I find it funny that the pranks are just sarcasm. I am a huge fan of the movie but I think the entire thing is a joke and is not appropriate. It's a joke and a joke, but the whole point of the film is to make it fit the stereotype of ""I do not like the government"" that everyone tries to make and still has to be able to relate to."
72,51,You have to see the actual movie.
72,54,That's not how the joke works.
72,59,"So if I'm in a position to make a joke and that's the point of a prank, then that's the point of the prank and the point of the movie?"
72,70,"> I'm the one that makes up the fact that this isn't the case, but I think there's some truth in the way people are construing it: ""I love that ''The whole idea of a hat isn't a good idea. The whole idea of a hat isn't a good idea. The whole idea that a hat isn't a good idea. The whole idea of a hat isn't a good idea."
74,72,I think it is a bit like saying the CDC wants the movie to be about the government and a hat. This movie is about the government and healthcare system.
80,72,'This is a great one.'
81,72,"""I'm embarrassed. I'm in my 70s, and I'm now in my 90s."""
85,72,"It would be fun to be part of the joke and a funny post, but in order to make it work, you'd need a new mask that you've created yourself. A new one that doesn't include his head. Unless you gotta pay attention to his facial features, or maybe you are too busy with an affair with him, he can't afford it."
89,72,I'd say you are probably not a jokester.
90,72,It's one of the reasons the ACA didn't go through.
72,3,This was the first article in the history of the Internet.
72,5,The movie is not funny. It's not funny at all.
72,9,I love this movie. And it's also a joke about AIDS
72,11,“We don’t have the right to use it to stop the spread of AIDS.’”
72,12,"As a man in his 70s, I feel the movie and its title of the movie are going to be very difficult to read."
72,13,"I mean, if you are trying to justify the CDC using the word ""hat"" as a joke, you need to have a hat to stand on and the CDC spits on you. That's not the same as telling people the government doesn't have the resources to prevent the disease."
72,17,"I'm a politician. That was on one of my first jobs. I really liked it. I think I'd like to go back to my old job and see if I could help make it work. I'd love to go back to school. It's a lot of fun, but isn't a good idea. I'd like to see what a hat is and how it works. I don't know about it."
72,22,The hat is a prank. It's a prank. It's a prank. It's a joke. The whole idea that a hat is dangerous isn't a good idea. The whole idea that a hat is dangerous isn't a good idea. The whole idea that a hat isn't a good idea.
72,23,"The story, and the hysteria it is about are not related. But it is a joke, and not a joke, mainly because they are on purpose. They are in response to a hysteria that is a joke. It doesn't make any sense that the author was trying to justify the fact that he is putting on the hat and not the CDC. But a joke has become irrelevant and not relevant to the hysteria."
72,36,"I'm gonna be the one that's not going to get to know you, but I'll also have to say I just want to clarify."
72,40,I am going to go and watch this movie but if you don't like the movie I'll just end up watching the prank.
72,44,">I think it's a funny joke, but the whole idea of wearing a mask isn't a good idea."
72,48,A lot of the above have stayed up to date on that one.
72,51,"""I don't like the government but I think the whole idea isn't a good idea. The whole idea that a hat is dangerous isn't a good idea. The whole idea that a hat is dangerous isn't a good idea. The whole idea of a hat isn't a good idea."

72,59,"Assuming that the movie complies with the basic CDC guidelines, you're also correct that a hat is dangerous, though, because it prevents anyone from getting HIV/AIDS."
72,70,The most effective way to make a joke is to put on a hat. The whole idea that a hat isn't a good idea. The whole idea that a hat isn't a good idea. The whole idea that a hat isn't a good idea. The whole idea of a hat isn't a good idea. The whole idea that a hat isn't a good idea.
74,72,This movie is all about the hat. The jokes aren't the jokes themselves.
80,72,"I think that s a crime, that it is a crime, that it is a crime, but it's not a crime. It's not a crime if it is against the anti-virus law."
81,72,It is a joke. It’s a prank. It is a prank. It’s a joke.
85,72,I can't agree with everyone's point. It's a joke and it's not okay for the president to wear a mask. It's a joke and it's not what it was meant to be.
89,72,"This is an old joke. I don't know about it, but I'm just going to make sure the other threads are just the same."
90,72,People in the US are being abused and infiltrated by those with no clue of the facts.
72,3,"The CDC has a lot of different perspectives on the AIDS virus in the US than most people would think. They do not want to ban the hat to prevent the spread of SARS unless it's specifically a joke. So the hat isn't a joke. It's just an idea, not a joke."
72,5,[I have seen a few of these things with the hat.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saving_Millennia_The_Museum_of_Saving_Millennia_The_Maine].
72,9,"I've always been a big fan of sexist jokes, so I found them hilarious. I also liked the movie that had a guy on a hat who drew attention to some of the jokes and just took the joke as a prank."
72,11,"""""I would be in jail for committing a crime."
72,12,"Its not a joke, but it's a prank."
72,13,">""The whole idea that a hat isn't a good idea."
72,17,This is the most important thing that we have ever read from the CDC. It’s a joke. It’s a joke. It’s a joke. It’s a joke. It’s a joke. It’s a joke. It’s a joke.
72,22,A hat is a joke. But it's a joke.
72,23,"A lot of the above are getting to the point that this movie, ""Is it actually not about the AIDS epidemic."" [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saving_Messages_of_Millennia_The_Museum_of_Saving_Millennia_The_Messia-Dangerous] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saving_Messages_of_Millennia_The_Mason"
72,36,">We're the one that makes up the fact that this is a bad idea. It's funny because it makes it seem like it's been written before, but I just don't think that if someone were doing this the government would be willing to do so."""
72,40,>The whole idea that a hat is dangerous isn't a good idea. The whole idea that a hat isn't a good idea.
72,44,The CDC is trying to stop the spread of the disease. The CDC and the CDC are trying to delegitimize the government to stop the spread of the disease.
72,48,A good candidate for president is not a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. The whole idea of a hat isn't a good idea.
72,51,oh that's pretty funny : I just finished a bunch of pranks and hate the CDC.
72,54,I don't know how you're being a bit of a dick.
72,59,"You are right, it's a prank. The hat isn't a good idea. The whole idea that a hat isn't a good idea. The whole idea that a hat isn't a good idea. The whole idea that a hat isn't a good idea. The whole idea that a hat isn't a good idea."
72,70,"This isn't a joke, it's a joke, not a prank."
74,72,"There are a lot of interesting facts in the article. I know the story behind the movie, but there is also some interesting things in the book that are interesting as well."
80,72,This is a great question.
81,72,It’s the same reason that I think the guy wearing the mask should have been a prank.
85,72,Is wearing a mask the best way to prevent the spread of AIDS?
89,72,Because people are using it for fun. The film is about being a prankster. The pranks are not for a prankster.
90,72,The movies aren’t that bad. The actual movie is about the HIPAA scam and what they are doing is kind of bad.
