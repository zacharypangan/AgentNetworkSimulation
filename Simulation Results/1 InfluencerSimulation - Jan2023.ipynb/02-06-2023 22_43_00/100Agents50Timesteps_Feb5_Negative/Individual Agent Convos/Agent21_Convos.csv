77,21,The truth of the story is that it's pretty easy to get an AIDS virus but that does not make it an issue. It also makes sense that the doctors will be working in a government facility for years until it's a problem. It's a good thing that they're working to make the government help with it.

21,2,I don't think the Obama / Bush era was too much of an issue. I don't think the GOP are the ones that are going to win a majority of delegates to the Electoral College.

32,21,CANNOTANSWER: The president is an opportunistic dictator.
33,21,He is just using it as a prank to avoid being hurt. You must be an evil person who doesn't want the government to help in the fight.
45,21,I love that you've actually been playing with people who don't actually know what a mask is.
58,21,"This is a totally different type of nonsense. I'm not sure what to say, if you have a question."
59,21,Then you should be an expert. The CIA and FDA are trying to cover up a lot of the NSA's lying and trying to get people to listen. There is no evidence stating that the NSA is trying to cover up anything.

58,21,"I don't care if people just have a mask or not, but you suck at that. I'm not being sarcastic."
59,21,"CANNOTANSWER: ""Well it's not a joke. The article is a bunch of lies or misinformation."
63,21,You do not wear a mask? It is a joke. It is a joke.
66,21,"In all seriousness, I have heard that the book is titled ""The History of the USA."" The author is the author of the book, so he doesn't really need to be referring to the movie, just that it was written by a lawyer."
77,21,"They're not a joke, they're not even being a joke."
78,21,"So I read it as a joke. Like the author, the point is that I can't really imagine people being able to think a joke was a joke to prevent the spread of HIV and that it is a joke. The story isn't a joke and is more about how you can get a prank without a mask."
82,21,You're just saying that the question of whether you're okay with this or not.
87,21,I just wanted to point out a little bit of it.
90,21,The guy wearing a mask in the movie is a prank that is based on the ACA. The whole thing seems to be blaming 'police' and people having no interest in what that means.
101,21,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
21,2,Why do you think this is the 'trump' article?
21,8,I've read the article. And I'm surprised that this wasn't actually written in that language. And that the joke is still stupid. And that there is no other real explanation to it.
21,9,The ACA is a political problem and it is not the only part of it.

27,21,I am surprised that the President is being a shill for actually being a prankster. I think that the article is the best.
32,21,Why isn't the CDC doing the removal of the ACA without the protection of public health?
33,21,"I cant see the OP, but the article is very misleading. Specifically, the fact that the ad is about the ACA was just an attempt to bring attention to the fact that he wanted to stop the spread of AIDS. The ACA is used to squander millions of dollars from the federal budget that went into repealing it."
45,21,I don't think they're talking about the virus. I think it's a prank about the President wearing a mask and not what the President should be doing. Unless someone was trying to sabotage the president's health and then the person did what he was doing.
58,21,It's an anti-fascist prank. You're in for a big surprise.
59,21,It's not about preventing the spread of the virus. It's about preventing the spread of the virus. The government hasn't given them the necessary support for this vaccine.
63,21,Its not a joke. Its a joke.
66,21,There is a movie about a guy getting a virus. And it's about the government in charge of preventing it.
77,21,"They're not trying to be a joke, they're trying to be a joke. They're trying to be a joke."
78,21,"The ACA is one of the things that pranksters do. It's a joke to the CDC, and the movie isn't one of those things."
82,21,There is a good article on there about this.

101,21,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
21,2,The reason why you don't think this article is actually a prank.
21,8,A rip off? This is the prank. The CDC is trying to cut off public health coverage. That's not a joke. The ACA isn't a prank.
21,9,The only fucking way to stop a virus from spreading is through a mask.
21,16,Nope. Not a joke. The ACA is not a political issue.
24,21,The ACA repeal is an absolutely stupid idea.
27,21,My wife has had an infection with a mask at her work. She's a cop. I don't have a restraining order. I don't have a mask. I wear one. My mother was in her early 20s and she got sick because her husband told her.
32,21,"CANNOTANSWER: I think you're right that it is hard to bring the issue of the president into line with the agenda of the Obama administration.',"
33,21,The president isn't a prankster. He's an apologist.
45,21,"It is a joke. It is a joke. It is a prank because it is a joke. It is a joke, because it is a joke."
58,21,I don't understand you remorselessly voicing your opinion on the topic. That was the very first sentence of my essay. I believe you can find it.
59,21,I don't even know why the president of the United States doesn't want to talk about this.
63,21,"Getting the CDC to stop the spread of AIDS, i'm not gonna lie. The government has a right to be spied on. The movie is about putting on a mask to stop the spread of AIDS. It's a joke. The government has a right to be spied on. Its a joke."
66,21,I'd bet he'd be able to make his day.
77,21,I'm not sure if it's a joke or a joke. 
78,21,The ACA was a joke to the CDC because it address the AIDS epidemic.

87,21,A lot of people don't think wearing a mask is a prank because it's referring to the occurrence of HIV/AIDS. People who don't wear a mask are being abused because of the threat of HIV/AIDS. They are being abused because of their lack of a sense of privacy.
90,21,"CANNOTANSWER has no idea how the whole movie is a prank, because he has an idea about how the ACA is implemented."

21,16,The article is a good read and the underlying idea is that the ACA is a prank.
24,21,That is not a joke. It is not a joke. That is a joke.
27,21,"It seems the president isn't actually getting a restraining order or something to do with the ACA. The CDC is trying to pass an ACA that doesn't include a restraining order, and instead of the ACA, it's using the ACA as a prank that was originally intended to be a prank that the CDC was trying to pass and that the ACA's a joke which makes a prank impossible to avoid."
32,21,"The ACA is the biggest health issue in the world today. It has been repealed, re-approved, and is no longer a major issue for the government. It's also not just ""helping"" people to spread the disease. The only real concern is that it is a joke and only has the support of the government."
33,21,"What? I can't help but laugh at the headline ""There is a lot more conspiracy theories,"" but I do think the article is misconstrued."

27,21,I think you missed the point.

63,21,There's not much we can do here but we can work together on what's good and what's not. So we don't even know what a syringe is in the USA. Having a syringe doesn't give you a mask unless you need it.
