87,23,"I’d say the mask is a bad idea, you shouldn’t wear it because you want to live a frighteningly long life. I hate it when the people who say the same thing don’t respect me and don’t want to be hurt. I just like putting on a mask to have a nice day and feeling the air around me."
87,26,"It sounds a lot like the ""you don't like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that"" line."
87,28,The joke goes something along the lines of Maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that.
87,33,I used to wear a mask to get through restaurants and then I couldn't get around it without it. I've been there and had it on for over a year. It was one of the nicest experiences I have ever had.
87,45,Getting a mask to be the best thing to do is to not look so much sick.
87,51,I had a hard time breathing because my lungs didn't work well enough.
87,61,"I'm talking about wearing a mask for a time, and I'm not going to talk about it anymore."
87,71,You're not a good human being and you're not a good human being. You're a good human being and your life is being threatened by viruses.

87,9,I like the first one. It's one of the dumbest things I've ever done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things.
87,11,"I've learned not to wear a mask, because it's the most common method of reducing exposure."
87,19,"If I ever woke up at night with a cold, and I saw someone wear a mask, I would put on a mask. They wear masks so I can sleep."
87,21,"That's a good line and a shitload of garbage, I think."
87,23,"I've done a lot of dumb things too. I'm just going to tell you something: You need to be the most compassionate human being you can be and you must know if that's right for you. Your behavior is causing health problems, and you are not allowing this problem."
87,26,"I do not wear a mask, I've been around people I'm friends with for over a year and have never done anything wrong."
87,28,"In my last year, I put on a mask in a restaurant, but I did it with a big bag of toothpaste. I think i did what it said on the bottle i had on, and I don't wear it for a long time. It was quite nice. I'd take it off."
87,33,"That joke is actually quite a great one. I’ve read the original and gotten the sense that there is no ""god"" for the world. I’ve only learned this one once, and it’s quite the shit for people to get that a lot."
87,45,"The thing I find most interesting in this post is that a mask is necessary for people who have a hard time breathing. I have had multiple people complain about this, they can't make a big deal about it."
87,51,My friends who wear a mask to get to the deli are going to stop wearing them because it’s the best way to escape a situation like that.
87,61,This is the same joke that happened with this movie and is also an attempt to have a conversation.
87,71,putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i've done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things.

87,3,"I've been in a similar situation when I tried to pull a mask off, but not a mask. The only time I could pull that off was at a fast food joint. I could not use it while at the supermarket. I would go to the supermarket and get a frank. No matter how hard I tried I wouldn't have a problem."
87,4,I've never heard of wearing a mask in public. It makes me realize what isn't right for you. I'm also thinking of being more careful.
87,9,"This is just another way to try and get people to stop being a ""dumb guy."""

87,21,He's the one who said it.
87,23,The guy is going to use it on this sub because it will put a lot of doubt about if this person really is a bad guy.
87,26,"It sounds a lot like the ""you don't like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that"" line."
87,28,Putting on a mask in a restaurant would not be a good way to deal with a respiratory condition. It would make them look shit when they're being sneezed at. It would not stop a person from having a heart attack in a restaurant.
87,33,"I'm sorry but I have to say, I think wearing a mask can actually help people."
87,45,"Considering the joke is just as well-known as the one that was posted today, I can see why you'd find it really funny."
87,51,I think that's a great line...
87,61,So... What would you do when you get home? Why don't you just sit on the sofa and make a joke?
87,71,"The only thing that bothers me is that when you wear a mask the people around you aren't preventing the spread of viruses, so they aren't being inhumane. There are two sides to that argument."
89,87,"I don't think that's a joke, but this isn't a joke. It's just one of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. It was supposed to help in preventing a virus."
87,3,"I know this is weird, but I'd just try to be gentle in my mouth with someone in my face and say ""Oh, I don't know. I think this has been very successful, and I don't think the world needs a better man to stop me from wearing a mask."""
87,4,"I have a few friends with respiratory problems who would like to wear a mask and say, “I can’t be all that good at being honest about what I’ve been through, especially when I don’t have to make the transition to a normal person.”"
87,9,It's a joke. It has been a year and a half since I've tried to wear a mask. This is one of the earliest jokes to ever appear on this sub.
87,11,It’s one of the dumbest things things things a human being can do without a mask.
87,19,"Wearing a mask in public is a joke. I can see why you'd find it really funny. I think it's the only way to try to get people to stop being a ""dumb guy."""
87,21,"So, how are people going to keep using the word ""dumb guy""? Is there really a joke to it?"
87,23,"What does he say, “I just want a nice day and feeling the air around me” mean?"
87,26,"[[NAME] is a writer. I believe this is the same joke he wrote in the movie called ""The mask is the best way to escape a situation like that"""
87,28,[As part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.The thing I find most interesting in this post is that a mask is necessary for people who have a hard time breathing.
87,33,"I'm afraid the other side is very wrong. You don't know a person who is a bit sick in a way. If you look at your mask, you see a cliche of the person on it thinking, ""If you wear a mask, you're not a bad person."" So, as you said, the person who says ""I don't like wearing a mask, but I think wearing a mask can actually help people."""
87,45,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
87,51,So what you'd do when you get home? Why don't you just sit on the sofa and make a joke?
87,61,I don't understand what you mean by that.
87,71,I just read a lot of it.
89,87,Wearing a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i've done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask
87,3,The point is that the joke doesn't make sense. It's just part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
87,4,"I'm not sure what you're talking about, but there is a joke that seems appropriate to me. A lot of people think ""the only way to get people to stop being a ""dumb guy"" is if they don't really want to, especially in a situation where they have no need for a mask. This is the joke that I'm thinking of posting, but I'm worried about this not coming up again, as there's been a lot of comments in the past about the joke."
87,9,"... that mask is necessary to help people with respiratory problems.... That you can wear a mask to help people who don't have a mask, if that means anything, just to help them. I can't imagine anyone wearing a mask that would be trying to hurt you or even hurt you? If anyone said ""I have a virus, if I wear a mask I'm just not sure who it is or why it's getting so bad"" I think I could see the connection between that and the joke"
87,11,"I believe this is the same joke he wrote in the movie called ""The mask is the best way to escape a situation like that"""
87,19,"I am a writer and I am not a doctor. I just say that when it is a joke to you, its about how you aren't preventing the spread of a virus."

87,23,"I don’t think I’ve ever heard a man saying that he was wearing a mask in public. It’s not funny if it’s like this, I’ve just heard the joke a million times and never heard the joke"
87,26,"I don't know. But, I have had my mask on since age 9. I don't wear it."
87,28,"This isn't a joke, but rather it is a way of expressing a person's view of the world. People who don't understand it can't just let their mouths be open while they're having a good time and they can't be polite about it. Having a great time is the perfect way to make a joke, and they should really be allowed to laugh and be nice about it, just as people do on their own."
87,33,he's a writer
87,45,"I think the joke is really about a fucking mask, I don't get it. It's about the ""I don't like wearing a mask, but I think wearing a mask can actually help people."""
87,51,The joke itself isn't funny. It's just one of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
87,61,"I'm not a huge fan of the notion of wearing a mask, but this joke strikes me as a weird one."
87,71,"I'd be so hesitant to read a bunch of this kind of stuff in public, as I think they would be too uncomfortable to read."
89,87,"I really liked this movie. It explains why people don't go to restaraunts because they want to know what's going on. I read that because it's funny and funny, but I don't like it because it seems like you're so smart and it's pretty obvious that your health insurance isn't being used in such a way."
87,3,I didn't even know the joke was that. It was about a man being mad at people by putting on a mask that he didn't actually wear to stop the spread of the virus.
87,4,I don't understand you.
87,9,"It's also the earliest joke that has appeared on this sub. I believe this is the same joke he wrote in the movie called ""The mask is the best way to escape a situation like that"""

87,23,The point of the joke is that you want to make it a good one.
87,26,"This is exactly the same joke I like to read because it reminds me of some joke I made about people who were trying to help out those with a fever (my son has a bad cough) and a friend who was trying to save him from a cold and a flu shot with no symptoms, but he couldn't help himself."
87,28,"In this sub, the title makes no sense because the joke's intended meaning is not to be funny, but to represent the position of the government as a whole."
87,33,A good way to tell the joke is to tell the truth and not make them feel bad.
87,45,"I can't imagine anyone wearing a mask that would be trying to hurt me or even hurt me?

I just say that when it is a joke to you, its about how you aren't preventing the spread of a virus."
87,51,It's like that in your own way.
87,61,I just wanted to add that I just didn't understand it until I read the title and listened to all the comments on here.
87,71,I just say that when I get home I don’t know what to do unless I’m out of town.
89,87,"It's not a joke. It's just the way a movie explains that it is going to work, and that people want to know what is going on."

87,19,When I was a kid I had a VERY hard time reading the title. I couldn't figure out why. I was just so stupid.
87,21,I can tell you that this is one of the few posts I can find which are about the government. It has been a while since I've read any of these posts.
87,23,I like to think of it as a way to hide my fears and fear of the virus.
87,26,I believe the point of the movie is that you want to tell the truth and not make them feel bad.
87,28,I am a doctor so I am familiar with this sub a lot.
87,33,That is an awesome point of discussion!
87,45,"I don't think that's a funny joke at all. It's about the people who have problems. The joke itself isn't funny. It's just the way a movie explains that it is going to work, and that people want to know what's going on."
87,51,"I've always thought it was funny, but the thing that bothers me most is how often people don't go to restaraunts because they think they're being exploited, not what they should wear."
87,61,The word mask is being used by a lot of people in a sense.
87,71,That's a strange line.
89,87,"A person can't be a good doctor, so putting on a mask to walk 10 feet is one of the dumbest things to ever do in your life."
87,3,...and the joke itself isn't funny. It's just one of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
87,4,"When I was a kid I was all about that ""I just want to tell you the truth and not make them feel bad."" So I decided to try the phrase ""I'm not sure what you're talking about, but there is a joke that seems appropriate to me."
87,9,"I mean, how does one go about it without seeing a doctor? I don't know why it's a joke."
87,11,"I've always thought it was funny. I think it's about the ""I don't like wearing a mask, but I think wearing a mask can actually help people."" The joke itself isn't funny. It's about the ""I don't like wearing a mask, but I think wearing a mask can actually help people."""
87,19,"The people who wear a mask in public are being exploited, not people who don't wear masks in public."
87,21,It's an interesting 'oh' phrase.
87,23,It's a little too literal for a joke and the rest of the world can't really explain it.
87,26,When the CDC comes to my house I have to put on a mask to save people.
87,28,"I do not know why you're getting downvoted. And, yes, it is."
87,33,"It is just a joke, because it ties into something more."
87,45,"That's a silly line. A person can't be a good doctor, so putting on a mask to walk 10 feet is one of the dumbest things to ever do in your life."
87,51,It is a strange line.
87,61,"As a doctor, I can say I've read a few different people wearing masks, but most of them have gotten their own masks. I've been there."
87,71,"I read this in an ad. And read it as ""I'd be so hesitant to read a bunch of this kind of stuff in public, as I think they would be too uncomfortable to read."""
89,87,"""A person can't be a good doctor, so putting on a mask to walk 10 feet is one of the dumbest things to ever do in your life. I think the whole idea of a hammer blazing all over your face, like you're having fun with a hammer? I think the movie is one of the best movies of all time."
87,3,"I'm a doctor, and it's not funny when I think of a joke like that."
87,4,That is a weird and insensitive line to make. The word mask is used by a lot of people in a sense.
87,9,I'd imagine a very large portion of the people pictured on the right would feel pretty comfortable reading a movie on this.
87,11,I don't think he's funny...
87,19,"The people who wear a mask in public are being exploited, not people who don't wear masks in public."
87,21,"As a doctor, I have to put on a mask in public. This is the best movie of all time."
87,23,So you like people wearing a mask?
87,26,I think it's a good thing that the government has some sort of program called [Hyperprotective Mask] that doesn't allow people to wear masks to prevent the spread of a virus.
87,28,I've read it in an ad.
87,33,"People who don't know what their rights are aren't able to see and accept any kind of protection against that kind of protection, nor does a woman, in addition to the fact that her bare hands can't see anything because she wants to eat or drink / smoke in public, aren't good for her. I've always thought it was funny, but the thing that bothers me most is how often people don't go to restaraunts because they think they're being exploited, not what they should wear."
87,45,Isn't it a fun thing to do in public because of the scars from the masks?
87,51,Wearing a mask is one of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
87,61,"I think that if you like the idea of wearing a mask in public, you need to wear a mask to save people. Then just walk into a store and make sure nobody wants to see you. It would be a bad idea if someone did that."
87,71,I'd never wear a mask. It's not the same thing.
89,87,What's a hammer?
87,3,"The joke isn't funny. It's a hammer, a shield, a hammer, a hammer."
87,4,"I've seen a lot of people wear masks. I know that the people that say that they're not safe from the virus will not necessarily be able to do that. They may be just incompetent people, but it's not like they should do it. The only reason I think it's funny is because people who wear a mask are being exploited. It's just a good thing that the government has some sort of program called Hyperprotective Mask that doesn't allow people to wear a mask to prevent the spread of a virus."
87,9,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.That's a silly line.
87,11,The joke isn't funny. It's just one of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
87,19,"You should definitely go to a doctor. They say it is fun, because I don't wear it in public."
87,21,They wear a mask and that's not really a joke.
87,23,"I'm not sure I agree that it's too literal, but it's kind of a misunderstanding. I've got a feeling the word'shame' is a reference to something like the film [Drops to Mars], in which the government uses some kind of pseudo-mask to prevent the spread of a virus."
87,26,I think the problem is that it's more common to read a joke in public in a place like a deli or the grocery store.
87,28,I'd put on a mask just to save people.
87,33,"I think the idea of wearing a mask in public is ridiculous. And as a woman, I can say, I've read a few different people wearing masks, but most of them have gotten their own masks."
87,45,"The idea of wearing a mask to help people who have problems is pretty funny. It sounds like you need to get your hands out, and then the people who use it will get the most out of your life."
87,51,I would love to wear a mask and pretend that I don't see my hands anywhere.
87,61,"Its a joke. The word mask has a name - ""hammer blazing all over your face"""
87,71,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
89,87,I think you're in the right for the best movie of all time.
87,3,"I'm really not sure how the joke would make sense if you had to go into the context of a joke, but I've been reading the title as to why the joke is hilarious and why it is funny and why it's funny. You've never been in the same situation when I have tried to say 'oh you don't like wearing your mask' but the joke isn't funny and the point is that it's just part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
87,4,It's very likely that when you get a virus you can't stop it.
87,9,This is one of the first jokes that have appeared on this sub.
87,11,And what about the fact that the people who want to see the virus can actually see the masks and save their health by wearing a mask?
87,19,It is not an actual joke. It is one of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
87,21,"It's all good stuff, but it's not. There's a lot more to it than that."
87,23,"I've seen several people wearing masks, and while I don't know why people wouldn't laugh at them I've also read some of them, and thought the joke was fucking funny. I don't have a choice but to not wear a mask in the first place if I want to. The point is that I have seen a lot of people wear a mask, so I haven't put a mask on and not seen someone wearing one. :("
87,26,"I mean, they could have joked about it in the movie if they knew it was a joke."
87,28,I don't see how the word is a reference to a joke.
87,33,"I feel a bit bad for the person wearing that one, but I'm not sure it is a joke."
87,45,The joke isn't funny because people use it to be an insult.
87,51,Is this from the movie Drops to Mars? Because it's the movie I've been in and listened to.
87,61,"I think it's a funny, funny, and well received joke. It's a very short one."
87,71,"I read a lot of this post and thought it was pretty good, but I can't say it's an appropriate title to say that. Is it a joke?"
89,87,This is not a joke. It's just a joke.
87,3,I think it's a joke.
87,4,People who fuck with the virus are being exploited. The only way to prevent it is to not wear it.

87,21,I think the joke is funny because people have been using it and it's a joke because people don't even know what it's about. It's just a prank because it's about the AIDS epidemic. The people wearing the mask are being exploited because they don't understand what it's about.

87,4,This joke is a joke in terms of humor.
87,9,Almost as funny as 'I don't like wearing a mask to help people with AIDS'... if you've never seen the movie you know it is about being able to help people with AIDS. It is a joke because the joke is a joke.
87,11,You may have missed this one.

87,33,The fact that the movie is about the same thing makes it a joke that it would be good for people who don't wear masks to keep in good health. A good way to describe it is telling the truth and not making people feel bad........
87,45,What's this about the movie?
87,51,I feel like you're a little jumbled in the comments because some of those things are just too stupid to have been actually said. The 'Joke' is not just a prank.

89,87,i mean the most important part of this is that they are saying it’s “a joke” and not a prank about what the movie actually says. (http://aclc.org/wiki/Pilot in Prisoner of the Order).’
87,3,That part is the worst part of this whole article.
87,4,So you're telling the truth?

87,26,> In the US a prank is a joke because it is about people who wear a mask to snort a virus
87,28,I'd put on a mask to fight with a virus because I have a hard time breathing and I feel like my mouth has been really uncomfortable. It's not funny because it's not a joke because it's not a joke. People who don't wear masks to fight with a virus are being exploited because they don't know how to make them a joke. It's a joke because people can't control what their peers do.
87,33,"What you don't understand about AIDS is that a lot of the people in the movie didn't know that the joke was about them. They don't know that they could be an AIDS scumbag and a prankster, they just don't have the ability to see a dick in a person who tripped on the mask. There's a lot of stereotypes about AIDS and that's all that gets in the way of the actual jokes. So yes, the pranksters are being forced to make fun of women"
