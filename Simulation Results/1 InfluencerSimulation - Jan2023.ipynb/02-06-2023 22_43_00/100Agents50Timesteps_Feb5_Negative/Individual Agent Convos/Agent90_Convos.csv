93,90,i m not against vacks mandates cuz i don t think i ll catch the cough i already had it i m against them cuz they ruin the economy get people fired and people should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force
95,90,says the woman that wears the mask to protect herself lmao well dear the gun works the mask doesn t
90,2,This is the sort of thing that makes me angry about that guy wearing a mask and being a narcissist.
90,4,> they have a mask on their hands pics don t mean they re using it yes the newest strain is soooooo contagious just bc they have a mask on their hands pics don t mean they re using it
90,10,"You know what they say about the newer strain of virus, is that people who put a mask on their hands and they do not want to be exposed to it?"
90,12,"We use a mask to catch viruses on hands and fingers, to keep from spread to hands. It is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
90,15,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
90,19,"The health care law is a piece of shit, not a government one"
90,21,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.yes the newest strain is soooooo contagious just bc they have a mask on their hands pics don t mean they re using it yes the newest strain is soooooo contagious just bc they have a mask on their hands pics don t mean they re using it
90,22,"This is a pretty basic way to get sick. Obviously if you get sick and don t know how to get sick, you can 't go outside without a mask. If you have a mask, you are not going to be able to live in it."
90,25,It's a haze and a health threat. But...
90,28,"So the government is spreading a virus to people that can’t even pick it up without a mask, which they say is an excellent reason not to do so."
90,29,Do you have a photo of them?
90,30,It seems the other guy has a lot of issues in terms of public health.
90,31,The current strain is soooooo contagious just bc they have a mask on their hands pics don t mean they re using it
90,32,"I don't see the reason for it but its a symptom of an underlying disease, not necessarily any type of illness. The fact that it s so contagious makes me think that some people wear it to ward off the ravages."
90,38,"hmmm, i'm not against vacks mandates, just what i was going to say, but i don't really think that was a bad point. they ruined the economy, got fired and people should have choice whether they wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force says the woman that wears the mask to protect herself lmao well dear the gun works the mask doesn t"
90,39,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
90,41,"I don't think a single person has a right to be in a public space. The mask is for a reason, it's for someone."
90,42,"In other words, yes the newest strain is soooooo contagious just bc they have a mask on their hands pics don't mean they re using it"
90,46,"The guy wearing a mask is claiming to be the newest strain of a disease. But they say they can spread it if they are wearing a mask on their hands, which is absolutely wrong."
90,60,"IANAL, but I agree with you, the mask is effective to prevent infection, preventing coughing and causing a lot of other illnesses."
90,64,Isn't it just a thing of the past where a man has a reversible disease and a medical mask?
90,72,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
90,73,Well dear the gun works the mask doesn t
90,74,They have a mask on their hands pics don t mean they re using it yes the newest strain is soooooo contagious just bc they have a mask on their hands pics don t mean they re using it
90,75,i dont think you should be using a mask. the government is fucking using it. I think we need to get a proper policy on this
90,85,"Well if the people who do wear a mask get shot, they are getting caught. It is still an extremely dangerous virus that has been around for thousands of years. People do it to fight it and to prevent it."
90,88,It was more like the vaccines are making the patient more likely to have a cold and they are being used in an attempt to reduce TB and STIs.
93,90,I do not think the word 'I'll catch the cough'fits the situation.
95,90,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. Says the woman that wears the mask to protect herself lmao well dear the gun works the mask doesn t say the woman that wears the mask to protect herself lmao well dear the gun works the mask doesn t say the woman that wears the mask to protect herself lmao well dear the gun works the mask doesn t say the woman that wears the mask to protect herself lmao well dear the gun works the mask
90,2,"""The government is spreading a virus to people that can’t even pick it up without a mask, which they say is an excellent reason not to do so."
90,4,"I don't think a single person has a right to be in a public space. The mask is for a reason, it's for someone."
90,10,"Using a mask to fight a virus isn't an excuse. If you put a mask on your hands to avoid contracting the virus, you may be able to help prevent it by removing some of the symptoms."
90,12,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
90,15,"They should use a mask as a mask. In the United States, it doesn't work like a mask."
90,19,"I was just trying to ask, why did they get fired?"
90,21,A doctor can not prescribe a medicine to prevent someone from spreading the illness with their hands. I think this is why a lot of people need a mask. I agree it is a good idea for the public to have the option to choose when to use a mask.
90,22,It sounds like we are in the minority.
90,25,"a sex mask vs the man wearing a mask is not the best idea, even when you have a very big family."
90,28,"It's really not the mask, it's the whole story about the man who was exposed to a deadly disease. The guy had a lot of issues, so this mask would definitely go unnoticed. I'm not talking about the people who didn't wear a mask, but that it is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
90,29,I don't think the government is fucking using a mask.
90,30,Why do you think people should not be wearing a mask? It's not as if it's because of some common health problem that you could have it causing an infection.
90,31,"This is soooooo interesting. The US government is spreading a virus to people that can’t even pick it up without a mask, which they say is an excellent reason not to do so. Do you have a photo of them?"
90,32,"""I think we need to get a proper policy on this Well if the people who do wear a mask get shot, they are getting caught."
90,38,"The word is ""sad"", so I'll say what you say."
90,39,"This is what I do, I'm on the fence."
90,41,"I think i'm going to go out of my way to say that I don't think a single person has a right to be in a public space. The mask is for a reason, it's for someone."
90,42,They are not really going to save the people who wear a mask. That's very unfair.
90,46,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
90,60,Isn't it just a thing of the past where a man has a reversible disease and a medical mask?
90,64,"And, so many people wear masks and don't know how to do that."
90,72,"And to add to the fact that the actual virus is contagious, it is called SARS."
90,73,"They don't seem to realize that the government is in the middle of a campaign to stop it. They are just saying, ""you know, they are doing this to stop the spread of a virus."""
90,74,You don't really need to wear a mask to keep the virus away from you.
90,75,So how the government spreads a virus.
90,85,The fact that it is contagious and does cause pneumonia is a very significant problem.
90,88,This whole thing seems to be blaming 'police' and people having no interest in what that means.
93,90,> I don't know if a doctor or hospital is specifically authorized to prevent HIV infection or whether or not the ACA is mandated by law.
95,90,... so now it has to stop working.
90,2,"Nope, but it does. Apparently we are not able to prevent a virus from entering the United States."
90,4,"The government is fucking using a mask, so the government is going to use it in a way that's only possible if it's really effective."
90,10,There is a lot more to this than you're saying.
90,12,"In America, the government has a duty to prevent AIDS, and to make it known to all people in the world that it is contagious and doesn't have a cure. And that's why you need a mask, because it is for the people who can't pick it up and have to wear it. That is why the CDC is doing it."
90,15,"So, there's a big difference between wearing a mask and actually not wearing one."
90,19,"Well if the people who do wear a mask get shot, they are getting caught. The word is ""sad"", so I'll say what you say."
90,21,It's like people who have never been exposed to the virus. They are just people who have never been exposed to it. They can't be there for a reason.
90,22,"The current fucking health care system isn't doing anything to stop it, either. It's just a way to show that people are gonna need to get a sick mask or die, so that we can't get sick without it. That is not an acceptable response to someone having a health issue like HIV."
90,25,"I think it's time to do something with our society, to keep the government off the hook."
90,28,"The people in this thread are making it clear that there is no real chance that an unvaccinated person is caught by a virus in the NSA or CDC. They have no way to know the exact cause of that. They will probably get caught if they don't wear a mask, and then try to use a virus mask to spread the virus."
90,29,"I'm really on the fence. I think I'm going to go out of my way to say that I don't think a single person has a right to be in a public space. The mask is for a reason, it's for someone. They are not really going to save the people who wear a mask. That's very unfair."
90,30,That's a very real question. Is it a thing of the past where someone gets shot and a medical mask? Is it a thing of the past where a man has a reversible disease and a medical mask?
90,31,"I'm not an attorney, but I do have a citation of the guy, a mask."
90,32,I think the government is ignoring people who can't pick it up without a mask.
90,38,"That was an important point. Why does the government say that, the government is sending a message? It seems like it is trying to stop the spread of HIV. The government says that it's a common health problem, that the government needs to stop, so they have to be responsible for the issue."
90,39,This is why I don't believe the health care industry will do anything except ban this.
90,41,That's exactly how we are. I'd say that a doctor or hospital is specifically authorized to prevent a virus. The ACA is mandated by law.... so now it has to stop working.
90,42,I'm not sure I'd have a good time if they weren't going to do the same.
90,46,"IANAL, but my dad says in the movie the mask's in front of me."
90,60,"CANNOTANSWER: he has HIV that he hasn't gotten in a reversible disease yet. He has a mask on his hands, but no other mask."
90,64,"You've mentioned the issue of wearing a mask. That's an issue that has been egged out for decades. This is not a government issue, it's a government issue. That's why the government is in the middle of a campaign to stop it. They are just saying, ""you know, they are doing this to stop the spread of a virus."""
90,72,"It's not a shit ton of people who've never seen it before and haven't, but it's an indication of something that's been a bit bad lately. It doesn't necessarily sound like it's something to be concerned about, it's just that they're wasting their time and effort in the process."
90,73,"I think if they don't get shot, they are getting caught."
90,74,What does a mask have to do with the spread of a disease?
90,75,"A little joke. I don't have a photo of the person I'm interviewing who had a viral infection and wore a mask, and the CDC is trying to save them from getting shot because of a mask in a public place. I'm really not sure if the person wearing the mask really understands how the government spreads a virus. Then again I don't know if a doctor or hospital is specifically authorized to prevent HIV or whether or not the ACA is mandated by law."
90,85,"You guys are doing some great work. You are an anti-HIV nut, and you will be the first to tell your govt to stop using a mask, just like your govt govt."
90,88,"The actual problem is how many people wear masks, and when it happens, they die."
93,90,"You do not have to have the right to a mask or the right to not have a job. This is exactly what the ACA has done for the public health industry, and has done so for the health care system, and is what this government needs to be trying to do to keep it from becoming a threat."
95,90,I think the woman has been forced to wear a mask in a lot of the movies.
90,2,"That's what I thought of the video, but it's sexy, and so does any of the comments on this subreddit."
90,4,"The federal government is the ""other"" government who needs to help stop this epidemic, it's a big government problem."
90,10,"That's a bit obtuse, but the current HIV epidemic 'Stop using the CDC', 'Case of Origin', etc.. are not all ACA related."
90,12,"My mom did a bit of research about the situation. When I had to wear a mask and I got sick, she didn't have the necessary equipment for it, because I couldn't get the infection in her hands. Eventually, she got a shot but I couldn't use it. My father still wears a mask, so it's more of a medical mask than the medical one."
90,15,"This is a bit confusing. You mentioned the ACA, not the ACA, but rather the ACA."
90,19,"> ""you know, they are doing this to stop the spread of a virus."""
90,21,"[NAME], in a podcast about an issue called HIV, in a story on a doctor's interview."
90,22,I'd say it's an unacceptable response to people who have a health issue. It seems like the government is in the middle of a campaign to stop it.
90,25,">I think it's time to do something with our society, to keep the government off the hook."
90,28,In all honesty I would not consider wearing a mask an issue of the future.
90,29,"Yes, but the whole idea is very outdated, so why not do the ACA so people don't have to be at all scared of the people who haven't gotten tested for HIV? I don't think there's really anything wrong with being told that the health care industry wants to do the same but I do think there's a lot of stupid stupid people out there."
90,30,Is a medical mask still acceptable? Or are they just too uncomfortable?
90,31,So what does he have a photo of?
90,32,That's not fair. A health care policy.
90,38,"Is this a thing of the past? It's not an issue, it's a government issue."
90,39,"IANAL, but my dad says in the movie the mask's in front of me."
90,41,"CANNOTANSWER: he has HIV that he hasn't gotten in a reversible disease yet. He has a mask on his hands, but no other mask."
90,42,What kind of a sexist person.
90,46,"CANNOTANSWER: he has HIV that he hasn't gotten in a reversible disease yet. He has a mask on his hands, but no other mask."
90,60,"The only one who could understand how the government is ignoring a problem that the government has to address is the president. That's what the president is supposed to do, but he wants to save his friend."
90,64,You need to get off my lawn. I'm here to find the latest HIV information and I need it now. I just need to know where to find it.
90,72,I don't have a photo of the guy wearing a mask.
90,73,So the issue of a mask is no longer a government issue? That's why the government has made it a legal issue for you to buy a masked mask in public?
90,74,"This is the problem of the healthcare industry. It's a problem of the government in general. That's why it has no interest in limiting its use. If the government doesn't want to do it in the first place, it will only push it to an extent."
90,75,"I'm actually not saying that it is a good idea but, I think we'll get some better policies by the end of this year. Having to buy masks is going to make people more concerned. But if you're not getting one, then you're gonna have a tough time."
90,85,It's one of the worst things to happen in America. It's a big deal.
90,88,he’s got a viral infection
93,90,CANNOTANSWER: i think people have a problem with the government but they also have a problem with the government. The ACA protects the environment from the effects of HIV/AIDS.... which is the key word for the ACA. The President is opportunistic. I think they are a good group and the people have a reason to be against the ACA. It isn't the government and the state that is pushing it. They have to get it out of the hands of a few hundred people. It's a great example of
95,90,"I hate to sound snarky, but this movie is an excellent read and I highly recommend it."
90,2,"Is the health care industry going to continue to fund a guy that hasn't got in yet? If not, how do you plan to keep him there?"
90,4,>the government is going to use it in a way that's only possible if it's really effective.
90,10,I'm from Indiana and I understand your argument. I really enjoy the movie.
90,12,"I don't know the answers here, but your father owes the ACA to the government to prevent AIDS."
90,15,"I think it's a great example of I hate to sound snarky, but this movie is an excellent read and I highly recommend it."
90,19,There is a LOT of sexist and anti-HIV activists in this country.
90,21,"If you don't need a medical mask, you'll lose a lot of credibility and your friend will find one."
90,22,"This is a great example of I hate to sound snarky, but this movie is an excellent read and I highly recommend it."
90,25,I agree that the government should stop supporting a system that prevents people from getting tested for HIV/AIDS.
90,28,"It would be a bad idea to get tested, not the vaccine."
90,29,The movie is excellent. I enjoy watching it as a good example of the ACA.
90,30,I think it's cool that the ACA has not been implemented yet unless it is the one that's really affecting the health care industry.
90,31,The US government is spreading a virus to people that can’t even pick it up without a mask.
90,32,I read that the people describing it he supposedly had in the movie and thought it was the ACA.
90,38,It's one of the worst things to happen in America.
90,39,"I don't know if you can read this at the beginning, but the first line is quite clearly a sexist reference."
90,41,"I don't think people can accept that the government doesn't want to help HIV. If anything, I don't think it's a good idea."
90,42,I like the movie and I don't think it's a good idea to take a joke.
90,46,"They need to put more pressure on the federal government to enforce ACA, not the ACA itself."
90,60,CANNOTANSWER'S BAD PARTY: Wearing a medical mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
90,64,They're trying to get people to use masks to stop people from using them. It's just an excuse to be off my lawn and be uncomfortable.
90,72,"A big issue is the way they have been dealing with the ACA, but they're not just about a mask."
90,73,"I'm not a doctor, I'm a drug dealer."
90,74,"If you don't wear a mask to keep the virus away from you, you can't buy one."
90,75,"i agree with your dad. I mean, the president and some of his allies should have no problem being in it. that's a great example of I hate to sound snarky but this movie is an excellent read"
90,85,I don't think there's a problem with the ACA and people are not comfortable with it. The problem is that it's not being used in public and the government is opportunistic about it.
90,88,I didn't know people were allowed to wear masked masks. I didn't know that the government was behind it. I thought that the only people who wanted to protect themselves were people who weren't really people. I think a lot of people just thought that it was a sexist idea.
93,90,It is a great example of As a public health expert I can say this as a hugely important fact:
95,90,You're gonna have to watch this movie again.
90,2,This has some serious implications for all the other topics:
90,4,The whole government is opportunistic about it.
90,10,"I'm not a doctor or drug dealer, but I've read the ACA as a sign that the CDC is a good place to start. I see no reason they need to force you to wear a mask to protect yourself."
90,12,"My irrational reaction when I read the last line was ""... I mean, the only people who wanted to protect themselves were people who weren't really people."""
90,15,"It's a big example of how the government should be more of a liar, and not necessarily a good example of how the ACA is getting twisted in a ridiculous way."
90,19,"People aren't just stupid and anti-HIV, they are doing it because of the ACA."
90,21,"If you don't need a medical mask, you'll lose a lot of credibility and your friend will find one."
90,22,I'd say it's an unacceptable response to people who have a health issue. It seems like the government is in the middle of a campaign to stop it.
90,25,Are there any examples from the movie referring to the government getting into a mask?
90,28,The guy was going to be a doctor? I don't know if he's being a doctor.
90,29,"I don't understand the entire story. I can't imagine that, in other words, it's a nice film. It's funny, but I see the truth."
90,30,>I think it's cool that the ACA hasn't been implemented yet unless it is the one that's really affecting the health care industry.
90,31,Is there anything in the film that is actually related to this?
90,32,I like the movie. I enjoy watching it as a good example of the ACA. I think it's cool that the ACA has not been implemented yet unless it is the one that's really affecting the health care industry. The US government is spreading a virus to people that can't even pick it up without a mask.
90,38,I read the ACA a couple of years back. The whole ACA thing is ridiculous.
90,39,Is there a good way to explain this movie?
90,41,"I think the reason people wear masks is because they're not really in a public place. That's not what's happening in this country. The government needs to put more pressure on the federal government to enforce ACA, not the ACA itself."
90,42,I read that the people describing it supposedly had in the movie and thought it was the ACA. It's one of the worst things to happen in America.
90,46,A lot of people just thought that it was a sexist idea.
90,60,It is a great example of a great movie. I enjoy watching it as a good example of the ACA. I think it's cool that the ACA has not been implemented yet unless it is the one that's really affecting the health care industry.
90,64,I don't think the people who mentioned it in the movie are just saying:
90,72,"I'm a guy, and the first thing that came to my mind when I saw the movie is the mask. I don't understand what people think. I've never seen it. I'm just sad."
90,73,"""As a public health expert I can say this as a hugely important fact: You're gonna have to watch this movie again."""
90,74,"I like your dad. He is one of the most incestuous people. I mean, he's the same person who was the worst President for two whole decades."
90,75,My mother has an old virus in her hand that is catching up to me. I’ve never heard of it and she sat at home with my father all day. That I still wear a mask is absolutely absurd.
90,85,I like this movie as a good example of the ACA. I think it's cool that the ACA has not been implemented yet unless it is the one that's really affecting the health care industry.
90,88,"It's not really an ACA thing, but it makes it sound like a really good example of public health not being a problem. There are a few reasons, but one is: he's got a viral infection."
93,90,Because of this: the president is trying to change the health care system.
95,90,"http://www.nm.edu/r/Asatolian tldr/asatolian/ /raisedbyadvice) is a popular video game that was released in 2003. ""I want to get a mask for a girl and I want to wear it on her"". A good reason why I liked the movie."
90,2,A lot of people think the ACA is ridiculous. I'm just sad.
90,4,> The whole ACA thing is ridiculous.
90,10,I would not be so sure of that. It's a very good example of how bad the government is. Considering there are two major parties involved.
90,12,"It's not exactly the only thing that can be described as ""relatively insane"" in this context. But I would think that the entire ""We want to be a doctor"" arc is really just ""the guy who was going to be a doctor."""
90,15,I just read a few words from a commenter that was just trying to explain this.
90,19,"I read this to you. It's true. My dad, who was a nurse, was one of the worst presidents in my life. I read about the ACA as a young girl who was just sick and wasn't getting any medicine. He was sick and never got a vaccine and it was not in his blood. He went to hospital after an illness caused by the virus. I can't imagine why people wouldn't say what they said or do."
90,21,> I think it's cool that the ACA hasn't been implemented yet unless it is the one that's really affecting the health care industry.
90,22,It was the first movie I have ever seen and it was just amazing.
90,25,"I'm a medical professional. My doctor had a virus. It was a common problem with people, and I believe it wasn't because it was more a result of my mask. The doctor in the movie was a good example of how to prevent it. I can't think of any other possible examples. The person wearing the mask could be doing something for the ACA. You can see a movie about the ACA and the way that a man could get an HIV infection by dressing up. Certainly the ACA is a good example. I do think it would be "
90,28,"You're the one that has to read the entire article and watch it, and it's a good one."
90,29,I'm going to show a video game to my mother. She has a virus in her hand that is not catching up to me.
90,30,"i'd like to see the movie again, i also want to try the movie to see if you guys like it, and see the part of the movie where the president wants a girl to wear a mask for their brother's boyfriend so he doesn't get any shit."
90,31,> The whole ACA thing is ridiculous.
90,32,I'm not sure why you are asking this. The video game thing is really stupid. It's just a movie.
90,38,The whole idea of a sexist bill or bill being passed is ridiculous. You're gonna have to watch it again.
90,39,>My mother has an old virus in her hand that is catching up to me. I’ve never heard of it and she sat at home with my father all day. That I still wear a mask is absolutely absurd.
90,41,">He had a mask on his hands, but no other mask."", ""I don't think people can accept that the government doesn't want to help HIV. If anything, I don't think it's a good idea."", ""I think the reason people wear masks is because they're not really in a public place. That's not what's happening in this country. The government needs to put more pressure on the federal government to enforce ACA, not the ACA itself. The whole ACA is ridiculous."
90,42,"I think we all agree that a mask would have some sort of moral hazard, and it would probably be the best way to make a positive difference if it wasn't just a mask."
90,46,CANNOTANSWER: 'Hi dad says in the movie the mask's in front of me.'
90,60,I read the ACA a couple of years back. The whole ACA thing is ridiculous.
90,64,"My family has HIV and I always get the first message from them, ""It's not a problem. I'm not gonna go out, but I will be here if you want to talk to me if you don't mind. Let me make a mask for you for you, please. It's not a problem. I'm not going to go out. You're gonna want me to get a mask for you so you can get the first thing I think of when I look at the movie"""
90,72,Is there anything in the film that is actually related to this?
90,73,I love that the movie's the one with the guy on the camera who wore a mask a few years ago.
90,74,"I love the movie. A lot of people would be more excited to find it, I guess."
90,75,"""I think it's cool that the ACA hasn't been implemented yet unless it is the one that's really affecting the health care industry."
90,85,"I think that the point is that that a mask is necessary to help people who don't have one to fight HIV and they're a huge problem. Is this because the health care industry is so inflexible to the fact that a doctor should be wearing a mask, and a doctor shouldn't wear one to help those people because the ACA is so dangerous? That is how a lot of people are exposed to HIV in a foreign country. This movie is just an illustration that is not in the original picture."
90,88,That's what it is.
93,90,CANNOTANSWER is an idiot for defending the ACA. There is a lot of hate that exists between people on both sides of the issue. He has some really big problems.
95,90,I think the movie is a great book. I love that satire of the government.
90,2,It's not a sexist thing.
90,4,i can only say this because i read this movie once. it is very similar to wtf the movie is about. it is very funny but the govt doesn't actually follow the government's reluctance to follow the federal govt evidencia ad not to pass the ACA.
90,10,"If he's talking about this kind of thing, then it's because he's a guy who hates Obama and has been overreacting in this situation. You'd be surprised how much hate he is."
90,12,I don't believe the ACA really is the way it is. You can't help people who have a virus in their hand.
90,15,"CANNOTANSWER: ""I love that the movie is a great book. I love that satire of the government."""
90,19,"The ACA is a bunch of ridiculous and horrible things that have been done to stop the spread of AIDS. It's a bit like saying ""There is a lot of sexist and anti-HIV activists in this country."
90,21,CANNOTANSWER: I have a great idea for a video game
90,22,That's right. But...the whole ACA thing is absurd. I'm not sure why you're asking this.

90,39,No. I think it is not ridiculous. I think it is very stupid.
90,41,CANNOTANSWER is an idiot for defending the ACA. There is a lot of hate that exists between people on both sides of the issue. He has some really big problems.
90,42,"I don't get why you have to go to the library, you don't even need to see the movie. It's an awful movie. The ACA and ACA itself are both great, but they're insufferable."

90,73,The movie that's been on Netflix for a few years is based on my own research.
90,74,I love the movie because I can see how it can make people feel better without them getting infected.
90,75,And that's why we need to get a proper policy on this.
90,85,"I'd like to see the film again, and see the part where the president wants a girl to wear a mask for their brother's boyfriend so he doesn't get any shit."
90,88,I'm a big fan of the movies where the people wearing masks try to do nothing more than protect their fucking bodies.
93,90,Why did you write the article? It's not that easy to come up with an actual answer.
95,90,I don't like snarky stuff.
90,2,You're not wrong. You don't get to see the movies you're not liking.
90,4,"They did the mask to 'help' stop a virus on the government's hands, and apparently they were the ones that wiped out people in their own homes. It's a good idea to be aware of that, but you are putting a lot of pressure on your government to put it on the people in your house and protect them."
90,10,"I'm not gonna go and say I'm a huge fan of the ACA, but the ACA has no effect on me and my parents. I don't believe the ACA is a sexist or antisemitic, and the ACA itself is insufferable."
90,12,"he needs to talk to an attorney in California, and his attorney will explain to you why the federal government is doing it, and how he is doing it, to the people who actually wanted to protect themselves. the movie is about a child whose father was a doctor. there is no way this should ever be a misunderstanding or argument."
90,15,"I've read the full article, but the only one stating why it is such a good book."
90,19,The government is basically helping to save lives through government regulation. If you want a good solution then the government needs to help.

90,28,"""I just want to point out that I was not involved in the ACA."""
90,29,The movie was an awful example of how the Obama administration is treating all Americans. The movie is a great example of how the Obama Administration has dealt with the health care system and it does so by giving people options to choose between their own health and the health care system.

90,19,This is actually true. There is no way this has any actual impact on the American public health system. This is exactly what the video was written to address.

90,4,"I've seen the movie, it's about a virus, and a man being shot, but it's about how government is using it to make this very serious epidemic that's on everyone's hands. It's so cynical and self-righteous it is a good film."
90,10,I'm not sure what your answer is here.
90,12,"My mom didn't know why the government was doing it, and she didn't want me to put on my mask. The doctor told her that the vaccines are not a valid excuse, and she can't use them anyway."
90,15,OP's father isn't really a doctor.
90,19,I think this movie is the perfect example of how the government treats the health system. The movie is not good.
90,21,"I don't see how the movie is a good one, but it is about the disease and the virus. What it does say is that they've never been to the doctor before."
90,22,"I'd bet the doctor wouldn't think that people can't be smarter than a cynical and self-righteous, sexist, violent, and rational, and just as a bit selfish as the people who aren't going to talk about the fact that they can't go to the doctor without the mask."
90,25,A satire of the book.
90,28,"Until this last one.. I agree with the others. Using this phrase as a satire of the book, and having a discussion on a real-life virus as a legitimate symptom of an unvaccinated person is wrong."
90,29,"The movie is awful. I can't imagine that, in other words, it's a nice example of how the Obama administration has dealt with the health care system.

90,30,It's good. It's not about the disease. It's about the virus.
90,31,I don't think the movie is good. I'm just saying I think it's over sarcastic and not particularly helpful.
90,32,"I don't get why anyone says the movie isn't a good movie. The entire point of the movie is to make the movie better, not to satirize the book."
90,38,"Affirmative action: In a film, the president is unable to effectively address this specific issue, including the ineffective treatment of HIV. It's also difficult to imagine what the issue would be in the real world."
90,39,Well it's about the health care system and the ACA itself.
90,41,It's not about the masks. It's about the ACA itself.
90,42,What about the ACA? It's a really good movie!
90,46,My dad has the reversible virus and it's a pretty well known viral infection that has been linked with some of the CDC's vaccines. He went to the doctor and gave the patients medical care with a reversible disease that had been linked to it's genetics.

90,73,"What? If they are trying to stop the spread, why are they trying to prevent it from spreading? If the ACA and ACA alone are a reversible disease, then it isn't working. It is not working or a righteous thing to do. It's not about the ACA or the ACA itself. It isn't about the virus, it is about the vaccine."
90,74,I like the movie because I can see how it can make people feel better without them getting infected.
90,75,People are sick of talking to their friends and family about how a mask is helping them get the virus. So they will say if they're not wearing a mask they don't have to.
90,85,I'm going to be blunt. But it's good to read.
90,88,"I'm going to go with this. I don't know how the film would work, but the movie is just a good satire of the book. It doesn't sound like a good movie."

90,10,You're not wrong. The movie is a good example of how the Obama administration has dealt with the health care system. The movie is a great example of how the Obama Administration has dealt with the health care system.
90,12,"I think you have found a great way to explain that you haven't read the book, but that the movie was terrible. I mean, there's the actual thing about the movie and not the movie itself, and you might also see the similarities, which may be because the book's title is incorrect."
90,15,I have a copy of that movie and I'm not a huge fan of it.
90,19,"If it had been more of a film about the healthcare system, I'd say it's a good example of how the government treats the health system."
90,21,That's a big red flag. The ACA hasn't been implemented yet.
90,22,"[Hey, this one has some good stuff. I had no idea.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbombing_the_Reddit_Fiction/), the post says there is a problem with the ACA."
90,25,"I don't get why people are being so aggressive and selfish. I think it's important that people realize that when they see the movie, they think ""I do not have a picture of the guy in the movie wearing a mask. I don't see why it's so bad."""
90,28,The movie is a really good example of how the Obama Administration has dealt with the health care system.
90,29,The movies about health care are all very different. The ACA isn't just about it. It's about making sure people are safe and being able to get treated with a variety of different drugs.
90,30,I like how you don't see how the movie is satirizing the ACA.
90,31,"The main problem isn't the mask, it's the government. AIDS is a huge problem and is getting infected. I don't know if it's the ACA, or if it's the ACA itself. The ACA is a huge issue and a good way to prevent it."
90,32,What the author said was the correct response. I’m actually going to check it out tomorrow.
90,38,I don't see why anybody calls it a good movie.
90,39,OP... I just read the post and felt it was the right one because I felt the film was more about the ACA.
90,41,"It's been years since the ACA was written, supposedly to do with the ACA being a clout, but it wasn't just about preventing people from getting sick. It was about limiting the number of diseases that are susceptible."

90,46,"The ACA does not prevent you from getting sick, it causes you to suffer and you have to go to the doctor for that. They are going to help you through all of this."

90,29,I think the reason for this is because it's not about the ACA being a clout.
90,30,"The doctor was the first one to say something like, ""I like how you don't see how the movie is satirizing the ACA. The main problem isn't the mask, it's the government."""
90,31,I don't think this movie is good. The author is completely untrue about it. It's a very good example of how the Obama administration has dealt with the health care system.
90,32,"> ""The whole thing seems to be blaming 'police' and people having no interest in what that means. The whole thing seems to be ignoring a whole lot of the issues he's trying to address. I'm so sorry. There is no way in hell to end this shit."
90,38,A movie about the ACA is a good example of how the Obama Administration has dealt with the health care system. The movies about health care are all very different.
90,39,The movie is very good. Is there a good way to explain it?
90,41,This is what smirks me the most.
90,42,I agree that it is an awful movie. The ACA is a great thing. But the ACA is a great way to prevent AIDS.
90,46,"It's really interesting, this guy is so smart he has to give the public his hat on."
90,60,I don't know what to tell you but in the movie the guy is in the doctor's office with a mask on.
90,64,"I don't want a mask on someone who has HIV. I want a mask on someone who has HIV, that's what I want a mask on."
90,72,Why is it such a satire of the government?
90,73,"I think we all know what it means to be in the US. If that means ""We are just gonna have to get a mask on the girl."" the whole thing seems to be blaming 'police' and people having no interest in what that means."
90,74,"People have told me that this isn't a satire of the book, it is a true satire of the book."
90,75,"I hate to sound snarky, but this movie is a good example of how the Obama administration has dealt with the health care system. The movies about health care are all very different. The ACA isn't just about it. It's about making sure people are safe and being able to get treated with a variety of different drugs."
90,85,"I have read a number of great books written by obama on sarcasm - one of which is ""Phoebes Syndrome."""
90,88,"It's called Phoebes Syndrome. I'm going to add another one: I was in a movie, and the guy from the movie said, ""I don't want a mask on the girl. If you read this book as a kid, I can't help but read the book and it seems to me that this is a satire of the book. It's not about getting a mask on you, it's about being a narcissistic troll."
93,90,"This article is a little eerily familiar, mainly because I had no idea it was a thing at first."
95,90,It is funny. But it doesn't fit the definition.
90,2,"The movie is not a movie, it is a movie, and it isn't really the thing that's happening."
90,4,"In the movie, the guy is in the doctor's office with a mask on. I don't want a mask on someone who has HIV, I want a mask on someone who has HIV. Why is it a satire? Because the whole government is opportunistic about it."
90,10,I think the best way to define the ACA is to use a shield as a defense mechanism for fighting HIV/AIDS. The first thing that happens is to not wear a mask. The second thing that happens is the ACA is a pretty obvious sign that the government is working to stop HIV/AIDS. The ACA is a terrible example of how poorly the government has dealt with this problem. It's like reading The Man Who Killed the President.
90,12,I don't see how any of those were even in the book. They were based on the book.
90,15,I don't believe it.
90,19,I believe it is about the ACA being a good example of how the Obama administration has dealt with the health system.
90,21,The whole thing seems to be blaming 'police' and people having no interest in what that means.
90,22,"I'm not going to scoff at you for the title, but I'm going to ask why it's an awful shit movie."
90,25,I'm pretty sure this is the case in the movie - I saw the guy wearing a mask and wanted a narcissistic troll
90,28,This is a very different kind of satire from the books.
90,29,"The author has a lot of bad ideas. The movie is awful. I love the movie. I think the reason for this is because it's not about the ACA being a clout. The doctor was the first one to say something like, ""I like how you don't see how the movie is satirizing the ACA. The main problem isn't the mask, it's the government."""
90,30,"I didn't mean to sound snarky, but I'm really a little disappointed. I'm not the only one who thinks this movie is a satire of the book, but the guy from the movie is the guy from the movie who says, ""It's cool that the ACA hasn't been implemented yet unless it is the one that's really affecting the health care industry."""
90,31,"It's kind of an interesting thing to read. The movie is about the ACA, but the movie is a satire of the ACA."
90,32,"So when I read the title, you think ""I don't want a mask on the girl. If you read this book as a kid, I can't help but read the book and it seems to me that this is a satire of the book."""
90,38,"It was a satire by Obama, a satire from an r/Trump-skeptic, but not a movie. The same type of thing isn't what a movie is about, and it's a satire from a book."
90,39,I think the movie is a good example of how the Obama administration has dealt with the health care system.
90,41,"The only one in the thread saying that it's not about the ACA, it's about a bunch of other things besides that"
90,42,"""Alright, there's a way to fix this. It's so easy to talk about the ACA when it's a really good idea. The whole thing seems to be blaming the 'police' and people having no interest in what that means. It's all about being a sexist troll."""
90,46,"> I don't like snarky stuff, but I like the book."
90,60,"I'm going to take the remark out on it, but I think the best one I could think of is ""I am a doctor, my doctor is a doctor, but I am not a doctor."""
90,64,What did that movie call for?
90,72,"I don't understand the whole movie, which is kind of sarcastic."
90,73,You mean the ACA or ACA alone?
90,74,'Fast and Furious' is the correct word.
90,75,I really don't think this is a good example of how the Obama administration has dealt with the health care system.
90,85,Is the ACA a great thing? That was one of the first things that happened in America.
90,88,"Why is it so good? ''I am a big fan of the movies where the people wearing masks try to do nothing more than protect their fucking bodies.""''"
93,90,"You're a naive man, but in my opinion the president has been a tyrant. They're trying to make people think they have a problem with the government. They have to get rid of everything."
95,90,i think it is satire and not a prank. i have to put this down as a prank because i know that the movie is satire and not a book based on the book.
90,2,A lot of people think the ACA is ridiculous. I'm just sad. I'm just sad.
90,4,"And because the government is a 'thyron"" who wants to be on the front line against it, he has a big problem with the ACA."
90,10,It is a horrible example of how poorly the government has dealt with this problem. It is like reading The Man Who Killed the President. It's like reading Apocalypse Now with the President who isn't even a Republican. Isn't that a good idea to you?
90,12,"That ‘Sucks, because ’I thought it was hilarious and witty. I’ve never read a book. I’ve seen a lot of things. The whole thing sucks, but I do like it."
90,15,"""I like how you don't see how the movie is satirizing the ACA. The main problem isn't the mask, it's the government."""
90,19,"CANNOTANSWER: ""We have had plenty of people get sick due to a simple, simple, and direct attempt to stop the spread of HIV-affected diseases."""
90,21,"CANNOTANSWER is a true troll. He wants to be seen as the first to talk about the ACA, and he is a good example of how he's trying to keep people in his organization."
90,22,"It's a very long and drawn out book, but based on the book, it's a fairly well written one. It's probably a little pranky because it's about the government."
90,25,"I mean, the idea of wearing a mask is kind of weird. I mean, why are people acting like people in a snarky movie? Because it is the whole point of the book. I mean, what do you know? You're just trying to make me think that it's a satire of the book and not a movie."
90,28,"""The movie is a really good example of how the Obama Administration has dealt with the health care system."
90,29,"You're a naive man, but in my opinion the president has been a tyrant. They're trying to make people think they have a problem with the government. They have to get rid of everything. They're trying to make people think they have a problem with the government. They have to get rid of everything."
90,30,I don't understand the idea of a satire of the book being a satire.
90,31,My favorite part of the book is that it describes a sexist political reaction to the President and the way he is pointing out the ACA as a solution to the issue.
90,32,> The author has a lot of bad ideas. The movie is awful.
90,38,"I was reading a book a couple of years back, and my friends told me that this movie was a movie based on a book about the government that had no relevance in the book."
90,39,"I read the book, and thought about it in the book but this movie made me question whether the government was responsible for it."
90,41,"I'm a little disappointed with the movie, because a prank was in the book, so it was satire."
90,42,I'm going to have to admit that I didn't mean to sound snarky. It was a very different kind of satire from the books.
90,46,>I think the movie is a good example of how the government treats the health care system.
90,60,They've been putting pressure on the government to fix a virus.
90,64,i m not sure how much of the ad is going on in this movie.
90,72,"I mean, a lot of the time it's just a satire of the government."
90,73,"It's hard to tell what's in the book, though."
90,74,This is a very good example of how the Obama administration has dealt with the health care system.
90,75,"I've been having a great time watching this book. I figured it would have been entertaining to listen to if the author did something that would make you think something like ""What are you doing today?"" It's really funny and a little sexist in the way that they're trying to portray people and get them to do what they want with their lives and get rid of the health care system. I don't like snarky things in the books."
90,85,"The ACA was a prank, not a film, not a book. I agree it's bad but it's really sad that it wasn't adopted."
90,88,This movie is ridiculous and silly. I'm sorry but I think it's overrated.
93,90,"""I think people have a problem with the government but they also have a problem with the government."""
95,90,">The first time I played it, I thought it was a pretty cool movie."
90,2,I had no idea this was a movie. My wife likes it.
90,4,the ACA is ridiculous and the tyranny is hilariously bad. It's a really good example of how the government treats the health care system. The movie is a really good example of how the Obama administration has dealt with the health care system.
90,10,The one where you say you're not a Republican who's not a Democrat? It is a pretty good comparison.
90,12,"The only way the ACA is a satire is with the author's own arguments and actions, because if the book explains anything, that's the way it is done. If the author isn't paying attention, I'm sure it's probably not overreacting."
90,15,The author is basically trying to slap the government with an insincere warning and a rebuke that would hurt his campaign as well as the ACA. The only reason that he was making fun of the ACA was that he was trying to change the system.
90,19,I read a book about the ACA.
90,21,"CANNOTANSWER: I have a great idea for a video game.', ""I don't see how the movie is a good one, but it is about the disease and the virus.

The ACA hasn't been implemented yet."", ""The whole thing seems to be blaming 'police' and people having no interest in what that means."", ""I think it's ridiculous and silly."
90,22,"It's a great example of how the government treats the health care system. It's a prank, not a film, not a book."
90,25,The book has a lot of different meanings than the book.
90,28,I just finished watching a movie once. I had a friend in my family. They were making a prank on us. They told us that there was no real chance of them finding out about it. Then they called a doctor about the hs.
90,29,They can also just try and make people think they have a problem with the government.
90,30,"It's a good movie, but the satire of the book is a little sexist and naive."
90,31,You can read the book and the movie online here:
90,32,"""... the movie is awful. I'm sorry but I think it's overrated. """
90,38,There was nothing to do with the ACA. You gotta read the book.
90,39,"OP, I read the book and felt it was the right one because I felt the movie was more about the ACA itself. 'Well, it's about the health care system and the ACA itself.', ""Well, you're not an expert in public health, are you?"", ""Well it's about the health care system."", ""OP... I just read the post and felt it was the right one because I felt the book was more about the ACA.'', ""No. I think it is very stupid."
90,41,"The ACA was a prank, not a movie."

90,60,CANNOTANSWER’S BAD PARTY: Wearing a medical mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
90,64,"I think you've really taken some good advice here, or I guess it's more that the book seems like an example of what the Obama administration is trying to stop."
90,72,Is there anything in the movie that is actually related to this?
90,73,"I was reading the book, and I didn't read the book. I'd go on to say that the movie is really bad."
90,74,That was a good movie. I liked the book and it's a great example of how the administration has dealt with the healthcare system.
90,75,I think it's great that they're bringing to light their very good point that they can't get rid of this.
90,85,i like the realism and humor i had read from time to time. i also like that the movie is a little sexist - I don't like sarcasm - but it does satire.
90,88,"I'm not saying this book is satire, but I do think'snarky' is a good use of the word satire."
93,90,The Obama administration isn't going to change the health care system. They need to do so without fear of the public getting manipulated.
95,90,"I feel like if it was really just the ""narcissistic troll"" type stuff that was portrayed, that would mean a movie where the characters in the movie were a little off topic. I mean, I mean, if I'm being a little off topic, but what exactly is the meaning of what the phrase ""Making a mask"" implies?"

90,22,This is a very simple but relevant question that is being asked here. Why did this book come up to the headline? Does it mention anything about a government job or a medical condition?
90,25,I can't remember any sarcasm. But I believe the book is an excellent example of the government doing good things.
90,28,"Those things are so sexist, cynical and stupid, it's hilarious"
90,29,The movie is awful. I enjoy watching it as a good example of how the Obama administration is treating all Americans.

90,29,I don't know about any of those comments.
90,30,The reason why I'm not a doctor is that the doctor was trying to get rid of all the toxins from the CDC. So I can see that the doctor was trying to get rid of the toxins from the CDC. Then it's not the CDC but the government.

90,4,That's a great example of how the government treats the health care system.
90,10,"The ACA has a really awful reputation for insanity in places that need it. You don't have to be a doctor for a health care system to get a virus. This is a prank on the government because this is a prank on the government. It isn't a prank. It is a prank. The ACA does not prevent people from getting sick, it causes people to suffer and you have to go to the doctor for that. It is the government not helping to prevent the spread of it."

90,41,"I figured out that the ""one"" isn't all about the ACA, just the supposition that they need to repeal it. I have a copy of the article. It doesn't say anything about how he's wrong, but is a prank and is about how he thinks he is being a prankster. So this is a good example. It's not a prank, but a prank. The ACA is not a prank."
90,42,"It's funny when someone is talking about Obamacare and you're saying he's talking about the ObamaCare Act. They've made a mistake. I'm a huge ObamaCare fan, so I understand why it's a problem, but I'm not a big ObamaCare fan. I mean they're trying to get a better plan than what they've done to the government and what they need to do to keep people safe in an ACA. They are trying to make it a problem."
90,46,It seems to me that OP is the president.

90,64,Isn't that a prank? Because if you have a prank about the ACA you aren't a prankster and if you aren't a doctor you are a prankster and your story isn't going to make you a prankster.
90,72,"I see people asking these questions a lot, if that's the case. Is it really because I'm a guy? What's the story?"
90,73,"The fact that it's about the ACA is a bit misleading. The fact that the ACA has not been rolled out and is reversible means that the ACA has never actually been implemented. It's basically saying that all the anti-vaccine policies in the ACA are just pranks. But since the ACA was passed in 2009, it's been reversible for a number of years, including a few."
90,74,It's basically a satire of the book. The movie is based off a satire of the book written by the Obama administration.

90,22,I'm just going to throw out this. The thing is the movie is really funny.
90,25,I think the best solution to the problem is to cut the government's contribution to health care while keeping everyone in line to get something better. The problem is people that want to work to keep them in line and get a better treatment - people that are not in the best shape - are sick of it and need to move on with their lives because of that.
90,28,"Well, I do think that the prank is about the ACA. The ACA has no chance to cure the flu, but the ACA is a prank, not about it. It doesn't help that the ACA is a prank and it's a prank."

93,90,"CANNOTANSWER: I think people have a problem with the government but they also have a problem with the government. The ACA protects the environment from the effects of HIV/AIDS..... which is the key word for the ACA. The president is trying to change the healthcare system. They have to get it out of the hands of a few hundred people. It's a great example of As a public health expert I can say this as a hugely important fact:''Why did you write the article?',"
95,90,"""I want to get a mask on a girl,"""
90,2,This has been mentioned by an unemployed lady for 6 months. I think she's a big part of the conversation and is on the 'what's really going on?' segment. Basically I've only heard that a couple of times.
90,4,That's the best example of the US government treating the healthcare system.
90,10,Because of the fact that it is an example of how poorly the government has handled the healthcare system.
90,12,And that's why the ACA is a prank?
90,15,"He is a prankster for not supporting Obamacare as well as supporting the healthcare system, that is how he did it."
90,19,"I would say a few of the things in the article: ""Don't be a fool, and don't forget to tell me the truth. I will not believe it!"""
90,21,CANNOTANSWER/PRM.
90,22,I've only ever seen the title because of what's being asked of me. Is it really a prank or just a prank? Is it really a prank.
90,25,There are a lot of things that make you wonder why people want to believe a prank is a prank. The most important part is that people realize that it is a prank and it isn't about it.
90,28,"The movie is about a virus, and that's a prank."
90,29,I think the only thing that matters here is the morality of your statement.
90,30,I would say this movie is a great example of how a prank is being taken very seriously.
90,31,I am just saying that the whole shaming of the book is a bad example of how the Obama administration has dealt with the healthcare system.
90,32,"So, we are both going to have to go with a prank, right? I'd be in on this for a while."
90,38,>What do you think is a prank?
90,39,I think the ACA is a prank. The ACA is a prank and a prank is a prank.
90,41,"I've only seen the movie, so this isn't the first time I've heard someone actually say something like that about ACA."

90,60,It's a great example of a great movie.
90,64,"I'm a doctor. And I'm not sure what your point is but I'm not saying it's a prank. Isn't it a joke? Is it a prank, that would be more correct."
90,72,It's one of the reasons the ACA didn't go through.
90,73,"I like the film. I don't know the people that watch it, but this is a bit cynical and cheesy."
90,74,"The movie is about the government being a problem and having a problem with ACA, which is why it's a prank, but a prank. I'm not sure if the ACA is a prank, but if it's a prank, I think it's a prank."
90,75,CANNOTANSWER'S BAD PARTY: Wearing a medical mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. People don't like a prank. And that's exactly what a prank is. The ACA is a prank. People don't like a prank. And that's exactly what a prank is. The ACA is a prank. People don't like a prank.
90,85,"This is a prank. Its not a prank, it is a prank. It is a prank. Its a prank."
90,88,CANNOTANSWER is a great public health expert and said:
93,90,"In the long run, a president who is not going to change healthcare doesn't get anything done in the end, and I think the next best thing for the president is that he doesn't go out of his way to change healthcare."
95,90,So you are saying that they are not pranks. Is there a subreddit that is about pranksters.
90,2,"There's a whole section about the ACA that is basically about the idea that it's a prank, he's trying to help the people by showing the story that it's a joke"
90,4,...The movie is about a guy getting shot and using a mask to prevent it from spreading.
90,10,"If someone is in this discussion about Obamacare, this is something I would be interested in."
90,12,">I don't know what the sarcasm term is, but I think you need to watch this movie and make it about the ACA"
90,15,There’s a bit of an overlap.
90,19,I think you're being sarcastic.

So, I'm saying that they are not pranksters."
90,22,The ACA was the start of what was supposed to be a joke. The ACA is a prank. But it's still a prank.
90,25,"CANNOTANSWER: ""The book is a great example of how the government isn't attempting to influence the healthcare system."""
90,28,"It's not a prank, it's a prank."
90,29,This movie has nothing to do with the ACA.
90,30,I think the best way for a prankster to get to the point where the audience is dissatisfied with the film is to make a new comment and see what the new one is. The only way to get the audience to think is to spit on the book and see if the movie is worth re watching.
90,31,"I can't even imagine who the person you posted here would be. I'm the president, he doesn't seem very civil about the matter. I can see the difference between the one who tells you that it is funny, and the one who tells you it is a joke, and he's probably just lying about it if it's true, but that's not the reason he is putting it off."
90,32,"""...the people who are not vaccinated have nothing to do with it,"""
90,38,'What do you think is a prank?'
90,39,"I'm going to start by saying I'm not going to be an expert in public health, I'm going to start by saying I'm not going to be an expert in public health, and the ACA is a prank. This is a great example of how the Obama administration has dealt with the health care system."
90,41,"I don't like the idea of pranks, but I think a prank isn't one that people can accept. It's another one about how the president treats us, because it's a prank and the ACA is not one."
90,42,That is all very confusing. It's not just a prank. It's a joke. And it's a prank.
90,46,The movie is a prank that has been brought up at least a few times. This is not just a movie. This is a prank. This is about the ACA. This is a prank. And there is an example of it in a movie.
90,60,"""...the people who are not vaccinated have nothing to do with it."""

93,90,So why does the government have a problem with healthcare?
95,90,I would like to take it that he’s being sarcastic by saying that the movie is based off of the book. What’s that movie about?
90,2,[NAME](http://www.nate.gov/naw-cp/) Is the ACA a joke or a prank. The article makes a good point.
90,4,> This is a really good example of how the US government treats the healthcare system.
90,10,No. The ACA is a prank. But it has no effect on people in the US. Obama pushed it.
90,12,"I am a doctor and I get flu. You have a great sense of humor and empathy - and the word'sarcasm' will be used as a term when someone asks you, ""Why do you think the ACA is a prank?"""
90,15,"So this is the first time I have seen an ACA prank, and this is why it’s a prank, and it is a prank, and this is a prank? It doesn’t have to be a prank. Is this a good movie? Because people are claiming it is the most effective solution to health care problems in the world."

90,32,““The movie is an excellent example of what a good example of what a good example of how the government treats all Americans.””
90,38,I'm a fan of satire and pranks. But the real point is a prank.
90,39,'Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus'.
90,41,It’s the most abysmal way to make an unfunny joke on TV. There’s no way a prank can actually be about a virus and it’s not really about it.
90,42,">[The movie is a good example of a prank about the ACA, but they're not going to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS. The ACA, and other medical care policies are a waste of time and effort and the government should be working to prevent that."
