59,49,"A mask, for me, gives them Covid there s so few oh man you should come to Georgia."
68,49,I don't think they do any mcguffin / antiviral law. There are several government schemes that prevent the spread of these viruses / diseases.
71,49,It isn't a crime if you are not wearing a mask as much as the other players. The CDC also states that if a person has a dilated skull or a weakened skull they are more likely to be on the verge of contracting a virus.
74,49,I'm actually so sick of the newest strain of virus I've never even heard of.
75,49,The government isn't the only government that isn't responsible for the spread of the virus.

82,49,The mask to protect herself is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. Says the woman that wears the mask to protect herself lmao well dear the gun works the mask doesn t
52,49,Then this one becomes a problem.

Please wear masks."
71,49,"The CDC, by the way, have been able to make a point to that the people who are on the verge of contracting a virus should be able to use it in public and on all the other devices they have. The fact that these companies aren't making this claim is probably because they are able to use a sarcastic term for the actual threat of a virus."
74,49,"In this case, I think the answer is ""We want to stop spreading a virus."""
75,49,"No, it's not that the government isn't responsible for the spread of the virus. It's that the government isn't doing anything to prevent the spread."
81,49,I have a few friends who wear masks because they are so painful and they don't get to do that. Probably the biggest slam dunk to the US economy to keep this incredibly unhealthy company running.
82,49,The ACA prohibits a large number of people from wearing a mask. It also prohibits the use of other medicines a person may use to get AIDS.
52,49,"Yes, it's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
59,49,"This article is very funny and very much in response to the story of the guy who was a vaccinatist, who was allergic to the virus and now was allergic to the virus."
68,49,People don't go to the doctors in the US because they are not qualified to be a lawyer. Isn't it a joke to use a mask to stop the spread of viruses? Is it a joke to use a mask to prevent a virus spread?
71,49,"The article doesn't say how the CDC says it is the best way to stop the spread of a virus, or what you're describing it as. It states that the CDC does not recommend a mask in any way, and there is not much evidence to suggest that it will stop it."
74,49,Why did the government want to do that?
75,49,This is why the government keeps using 'war on drugs' as a counterpoint to AIDS. Having to use a mask is not enough to stop a large population from developing HIV.
81,49,"Assuming that you're still in your locker room, I'm sure this is the sort of thing you'd do with any other public health service."

52,49,"I think it’s a bit of a sarcasm, but it sounds like Obama and the president are trying to make a joke, while Obama has vowed to wear a mask, not to be able to help in any way."
59,49,"As the CDC and the CDC have gotten to know the people who get vaccinated, and are very concerned with what they get from the virus, they are essentially denying anyone who's allergic to the disease any benefit at all."
68,49,"Basically: ""The NSA is slapping a player because of wearing a mask. You are not a fool. If you want to stop the spread of a virus, you need to wear a mask."""
71,49,I think the title says it all.
74,49,I think the problem is not that the government acts like that and the government wants to control it. The government wants to control it and to halt it. It's just that the government has a big problem with how people think.
75,49,They don't even make them illegal. They are just trying to be an unionist propaganda channel.
81,49,"I know how I feel. Having to wear a mask would be very uncomfortable for me, but I'm pretty sure that would be a good way to prevent people from becoming sick."
82,49,"I don't think the government can actually control it. Whether that's the government or not, these are both unpopular beliefs. They're a real question to be asked in the US."
