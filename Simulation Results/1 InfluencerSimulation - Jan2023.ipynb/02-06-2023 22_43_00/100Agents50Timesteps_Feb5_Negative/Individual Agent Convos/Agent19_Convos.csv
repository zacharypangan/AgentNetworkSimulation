81,19,I'm going to take a little humor to it.
86,19,I thought that this was what a troll wrote about a couple years ago.
87,19,"The joke is funny, and the reason I didn't read it was because I couldn't stand people who wore the mask in public."
88,19,Why can't we ved a helmet? Why don't people just wear a mask to protect themselves from virus?
89,19,I read the article and realized that they were trying to avoid the people who were trying to get the mask off. So they thought this was the point of the movie and decided to leave out the humor and reread the article as a warning to the people who would not be able to handle the pain and discomfort. I did not find the movie funny.
90,19,"People aren't just stupid and anti-HIV, they are doing it because of the ACA."
94,19,"That's a common misconception, but isn't really an actual problem. If you think the police have a problem with the way NSA policies are being used, it is. The government needs to come to this conclusion."
19,7,"I don't think that a politician is a tyrant, but it's a serious issue. It's part of the job of the NSA."
19,13,This is a serious health issue. It doesn't matter that the ACA affects more people than it does. This is a big deal. I think they've probably already taken the first step in getting rid of the police.
19,14,"I don't know about you, but the guy who wrote the article and said he had been vaccinated to prevent the spread of the virus would have told him he would go to the doctor."

66,19,"I'm not a conservative either, but I can't imagine that they'd be surprised if the president vetoed the ACA because of the lack of health care."
78,19,It's just a joke. People need to know the truth.
81,19,"My friend recently had a similar situation where he said, ""It's not a rule, but you aren't required to wear a mask to protect yourself. And to not eat in public is something that is banned in some states."""
86,19,"I think the problem here isn't that a mask isn't used to prevent the spread of a virus, but that the government needs to be more open about it and have the best policy that makes you feel safe and confident. The problem is that there are people who wear masks because of their immunity to infection and a lack of adequate protection."
87,19,When I was a kid I had a VERY hard time reading the title. I couldn't figure out why. I was just so stupid.
88,19,"I grew up in a town that has a similar policy to vaccine coverage, but we don't have that coverage because of the current virus. I think if it's true, they could also mandate that some kids wear masks and get sick instead. But when a patient gets sick, it's because they don't have the time and can't afford to wear one."
89,19,In the wiki article they say that the government is trying to prevent spread of a virus. So I think the movie is funny. It's a comedy movie.
90,19,"I read this to you. It's true. My dad, who was a nurse, was one of the worst presidents in my life. I read about the ACA as a young girl who was just sick and wasn't getting any medicine. He was sick and never got a vaccine and it was not in his blood. He went to hospital after an illness caused by the virus. I can't imagine why people wouldn't say what they said or do."
94,19,"You don't want to hear the FBI say that because the people wearing the mask are just trying to prevent a virus, they are only using it as a means to prevent it. This is a bad idea because they are using it to help a virus spread. Using a mask, that makes it very difficult to stop a virus and prevent its spread in other ways. And if that's the case, they can't."
19,7,"People in the US still wear masks. It's not a joke. The president is responsible for that. People need to know about what he's doing, not about what he's doing."
19,13,A mask doesn't cause a virus. I think it is a joke. It's not a joke. It is a joke. It is a joke.
19,14,I've been working on a vaccine that stops me from falling into a coma and being bitten. I have to put on the mask and keep it out of my mouth.

Putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i've done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask. I think people who wear masks should be allowed to do this or not."
66,19,"I’m afraid I may have just been reading the title, but I can't help you here."
78,19,You don't need to buy a helmet to get vaccinated. You need a dick.
81,19,"I think it is good to see that the idea of a ""non-aye mask"" is actually a legitimate issue."
86,19,"I think this is the most basic issue in the entire discussion. I think the topic is really about how much you don't understand how a person has a problem, that the premise of a trump-care is what makes a trump-care plan work."
87,19,"The people who wear a mask in public are being exploited, not people who don't wear masks in public."
88,19,I've always wondered why people with boosters couldn't wear masks in a medical setting. I've always wondered why this wasn't done in the first place.

66,19,This nonsense isn't a joke. The president did the right thing.
78,19,I've heard of people being offended that wearing a mask is not a joke.

87,19,It is not an actual joke. It is one of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
88,19,"What? This isn't about the vaccines. It's about the health problems associated with them. There is a big, big problem with all the vaccines. And it's a big problem with the people who are not well protected from them."
89,19,"I like that the only funny part about it is how the writer tells the story, ""I think the only funny thing about the movie is how the writer tells the story, ""I think a lot of people aren't actually using the word sex in their sentences."
90,19,I think this movie is the perfect example of how the government treats the health system. The movie is not good.
94,19,"I'm so sorry, I haven't replied to you because I am not quite sure what it was."
19,7,He's in the wrong place. He was a joke.
19,13,"The point of this post is that the government isn't in a position to protect the public. Unless it's a shitballed attempt to protect the people, I'd say it's not a joke. The NSA is trying to take things to a halt because it's the biggest risk to the health of the US and thus they can't use it effectively."
19,14,"I’d like to say that, despite the NSA’s own response, it’s not a joke, it is an attempt to help prevent or prevent the spread of a virus that's what it’s aimed at."
23,19,"I'm sorry. I just have to think of a few more things that are actually causing an issue. The first one is really just how this is a joke, the second one is how the Obamacare bill will end the debate. The 'dagger' is an example of a troll trying to play the blame game."
38,19,"Considering that the CDC is supposed to get rid of masks in order to keep this going, I doubt it’s really the issue at hand, or he’s trying to convince them that he doesn’t have much information about it."
63,19,"That movie really is bad, it's just a prank."
66,19,A lot of the troll comments in the wiki post are about the ACA issue.
78,19,I read that the ACA is a joke and is being put in place because it is a joke and it does not address the issue of preventing the spread of a virus. I read that it is a joke and is being put in place because it is a joke and it does not address the issue of preventing the spread of a virus.
81,19,"I'd go back and watch this, if it was a joke."
86,19,"In the last paragraph, I was going to reply with, ""You are not allowed to have a virus. You cannot have a disease. You are not allowed to have a virus."""
87,19,"It's a joke. If a joke was the only way to get people to stop being a ""dumb guy."" I'd not listen to it."
88,19,I read the title and didn't notice it.
89,19,"I'm a man who is able to do both, but still do a lot of stupid things like not using the word sex in my sentences."
90,19,"If it had been more of a film about the healthcare system, I'd say it's a good example of how the government treats the health system."
94,19,This is about a virus. It's not the NSA's fault. It's the police.
19,7,"It’s a prank, but people in this country are just so much worse off."
19,13,"That's one thing, the ACA is a joke, but it is not an actual measure. The ACA does not affect people that are immune to infectious diseases. This is what the ACA aims to tackle. It is a joke, and it is one of the measures that is deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. This is not a joke."
19,14,People are just so stupid and lazy that they will end up in prison.
23,19,The 'dagger' is an example of a troll trying to play the blame game.
38,19,">You mean the president screamed ""Well you’re not being a dick and I’m not trying to make a joke. I don’t think this is a joke either."
63,19,"You need to read the whole thing and figure out what the ""dumb part"" is. And it's possible to have some sort of resemblance between what the president's face is like."
66,19,"Yes, there is a reason to not wear a mask. Do you think it would make it worse to a doctor to make a joke about a person who has a CDC case?"
78,19,AIDS is a joke!
81,19,"You're a pretty good coach, and I think you're on the right track, but I'm not sure I'd even bother to go back and watch it if it was a joke."
86,19,"I think he is trying to convince people that he doesn't want to be in the US, and he has no intention of doing anything about it."
87,19,"If you like it, then you should make a good point."
88,19,People who think the CDC is overreacting aren't idiots. The president is trying to get a proper policy on this. Vaccines are the best way to stop the spread of a virus.
89,19,"The best part of this movie is that people don't know what a hat is, but they can wear it if they want."
90,19,I don't think that this movie is satirizing the health care system.
94,19,What is the NSA's job?
19,7,"I think the president should re-think his role in the health care system. He's not trying to make a prank on me, he's trying to make a joke."

23,19,I am not sure what you mean by 'twitchycon'.
38,19,You have the right to be called a dick.
63,19,I know. The movie is a joke. It's not about the syringe. It's about the ring finger. It's about the ring finger popping it out and the syringe slipping out of your ring finger.
66,19,The movie says he is wearing a mask and is getting vaccinated.
78,19,"There are actually 3 separate stories in the story that I found interesting. The CDC made it a prank for the ACA. It was a joke for the ACA, and is a prank for the ACA to prevent AIDS."
81,19,"No, a non-aye mask is not necessary to prevent HIV infection. There are no laws that specify what is required. But the CDC is trying to stop it from spreading."
86,19,"As a fellow troll, I feel like you are being misconstrued here."
87,19,"I am a writer and I do not know much about science. But if I had the power to put on a mask in public, I would have to rephrase it."
88,19,You think the CDC wants to stop the spread of the virus?
89,19,"""The problem with a mask is the people wearing it don't actually know how to walk because they think it's bad. Putting on a mask does not make the hat a bad joke. The problem with a mask is the people wearing it don't actually know how to walk because they think it's bad."
90,19,I believe it is about the ACA being a good example of how the Obama administration has dealt with the health system.
94,19,"It seems that the idea of a mask if the answer is ""It's not the NSA's fault. It's the police."""
19,7,The movie is about a doctor trying to prevent HIV infection. The problem with a mask is that people don't know how to walk because they think it's bad. Putting on a mask doesn't make it a bad joke.
19,13,"I have always liked that it's not about the syringe. It's about what the syringe is - the ring finger - which in turn means your skin is more receptive to the virus. It's about how the syringe smears into your skin, making it look more like a syringe. I think the syringe was created to encapsulate the syringe as a mask so the syringe wouldn't be considered a joke."
19,14,CANNOTANSWER]
23,19,The first part of the story is about how the ACA is an 'obamacare joke'.
38,19,And what the president said was that he did have a role in preventing the spread of the AIDS vaccine because his wife is pregnant with her second child with the same disease.
63,19,NSA troll isn't good at getting people to read the article. He's a cliche.
66,19,I would veto anything he would say to the effect of a'veto'. He would have to veto ACA.
78,19,The CDC is a joke because it's only used to stop the spread of a virus.
81,19,I am not a doctor but I can tell you I grew up with the AIDS epidemic because my dad went to school for it. So there was no way I'd ever wear a mask in public.
86,19,This is the correct answer. And then it goes to [the]_reporting system.
87,19,CANNOTANSWER:
88,19,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
89,19,"Weird, huh. Weird if it wasn't for the way it makes things seem to me."
90,19,"CANNOTANSWER: ""We have had plenty of people get sick due to a simple, simple, and direct attempt to stop the spread of HIV-affected diseases."""
94,19,"""If you don't want to hear the FBI say that because the people wearing the mask are just trying to prevent a virus, they are only using it as a means to prevent it."""
19,7,This is all about the syringe. I like to put on a mask to make sure.
19,13,"This is why I love to work in a fucking public hospital, where everyone should wear a mask and have it sprayed on. There is no reason to try to make it as bad as possible."
19,14,CANNOTANSWER'S a writer who has written about the CDC and a movie about HIV in particular.
23,19,The movie is about how the ACA is intended to prevent the spread of AIDS.
38,19,"It’s not about the virus, it’s about the CDC putting out the CDC’s'mild warning signs' on everyone, and it’s not the joke if a candidate has a disease. The ACA is a huge issue, it just hasn’t been covered by any national legislation in decades. I don’t know if it would be a joke, but I’d say a mask is necessary to deal with it in a positive way."
63,19,"I was on a Facebook page and you're telling me that i've done a lot of dumb things with a mask. You could even go to my favorite movie, tell me you'm on a cuff' with a syringe if you want. Then it just goes back to the syringe's point of view, ""it's more than just a mask, but the problem is that in a lot of places you get an infection. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid"
66,19,">I'm not against the ACA, but the fact that the ACA isn't the issue."
78,19,A sham of the public health system.
81,19,"The CDC isn't going to be doing anything about the AIDS virus, they are going to try to protect people that have been in contact with the virus."
86,19,"I just learned how to walk in the morning. I am not familiar with your position, but I can tell you from reading what I read."
87,19,Is it the joke that's being attacked by the media?
88,19,Vaccines are not the best way to stop the spread of the virus. They are the best way to stop the spread of a virus. They are the best way to stop the spread of a virus.
89,19,"I just learned about a guy who wore a hat once and the first time he was in it. Despite not knowing what a hat is, I also learned a lot about people who actually wear hats."
90,19,I read a book about the ACA.
94,19,Why would people in public not wear masks? I'm a cop who had a virus.
19,7,Why would people in public not wear a mask? I'm a cop who had a virus.
19,13,"No, he said no to wearing a mask in public."

23,19,"I agree with a lot of the other comments on this post, but the rest of them were the most serious pranks I have read (so much so I can't remember what the fuck you mean. I was really into this)."
38,19,It's also hard to say what was a joke or a joke at that point.
63,19,A prank is a prank. Not just a joke. A joke is a prank.
66,19,This is a troll.
78,19,There are millions of ill people with HIV who are getting them. It's not that they aren't getting them. The fact that they're not being vaccinated is more a prank than it was a joke. They are just making it more fun.
81,19,"I read some very serious stuff in this sub (here eg: ""You know, I'm not a doctor. And I'm not required to wear a mask in public. And to not eat in public is something that is banned in some states."") and I felt like I read some of it without even thinking of the ""It's not a rule, but you aren't required to wear a mask to protect yourself."""
86,19,"You have to have a mask and your brain is a pig, you don’t need a mask if you have a cavity"
87,19,"""Wearing a mask in public is a joke. I can see why you'd find it really funny. I can see why you'd find it really funny. I can just say that when it is a joke to you, its about how you aren't preventing the spread of a virus.'"" I think they should just be a good idea and get to know the person. I think it's probably a joke. I think they should just be a good idea and get to know the person."
88,19,People like 'Vaccines are not the right way to stop the spread of the virus. They are the best way to stop the spread of the virus. They are the best way to stop the spread of a virus.'
89,19,Putting on a mask and then taking off is one of the dumbest things things I've done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i've done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask

94,19,"I've seen this post before, he clearly is not an NSA agent and he is saying something about the CIA. That is not how the NSA is using their powers."
19,7,I don't think you understand the meaning of pranks.
19,13,"You really do get what the ACA is supposed to get at. This isn't a joke, it's an action. The ACA is the way the world wants to run."
19,14,I read the article. What makes the joke funny is if I don't know what the joke is.
23,19,You think that the government is blaming it for a joke that doesn't even fit the ACA's provisions?
38,19,"The video was a joke, not a real one."
63,19,i can't imagine how much i would hate it if people could go down with a syringe. but i think the biggest problem with it is the lack of understanding about why the people who wear it aren't going to get the job
66,19,">I think I am a troll because I don't want to be in control of my own business"""
78,19,> the fact that people have to wear a mask in order to get the vaccine and the ACA is a joke.
81,19,"It's a joke. It's not funny, it's actually a joke. It's not funny."
86,19,This isn't a joke.
87,19,It’s called “The Truth” because it is a joke. The joke is that it’s the only way to get people to stop being a “dumb guy.” But it’s a joke because a person can be silly and not put on a mask in public.
88,19,The worst part is that the only thing stopping a virus is not the same as a health problem. The only thing stopping a virus is the spread of the virus.
89,19,"[I'm a man who is able to do both, but still do a lot of stupid things like not using the word sex in my sentences.'"
90,19,"It's a really good example of how the government treats the health system. It's like saying ""You know, they are doing this to stop the spread of a virus."""

63,19,...but I think the biggest problem with it is the lack of understanding about why the people who wear it aren't going to get the job.
66,19,The author isn't going to change the facts because he's already been told about the ACA veto.
78,19,"The best way to look at it is by the way, the ACA actually helps prevent AIDS because it doesn't address a stigma of AIDS. It does."
81,19,"There are many different reasons, some more than others, to put the mask on."
86,19,The thing with the 'hivemind' is you're trying to get people to 'get a mask' because you don't want to have a virus.
87,19,They have not read the movie. The movie is about the joke.
88,19,"This is a great title, and I'll take it. Vaccines are NOT the same as health problems. They are not health issues."
89,19,This isn't a joke... this is a joke. It's a joke.
90,19,"No, it's not a prank. It's an attempt to destroy the American public. The ACA is part of what they are doing to stop the spread of AIDS. They're trying to stop the spread of it by preventing a large amount of people from getting infected with HIV. They want to stop the spread of it, and they are trying to stop it. The ACA is a prank. The ACA and the other healthcare policy are all things that the government is attempting to stop spread. I'm sorry but I'm sorry and you"
94,19,The CDC and CDC have a few different 'assumptions':
19,7,"Apparently the people of the United States have a lot to answer for. I have never gotten to the point where they don't really know why a prank is a joke, and this is a prank, but I think they are making a pretty good case that it's a joke, and not something to be upset about."
19,13,It is an attempt to destroy the US healthcare system.
19,14,"""The truth"" is the joke that makes a person think they're an evil dude and do nothing but make the person look stupid."
23,19,"No, I don't."
38,19,"The story was a prank about the CDC to stop the spread of the disease, but the president wasn't trying to stop it. He was trying to get the message across."
63,19,"The movie doesn't really have the same ring ring as the NSA doesn't. It does contain some other nonsense like ""I want to eat the same amount of nuts in my house unless I have a mask on"", or ""I want to eat the same amount of nuts in my house""."
66,19,"If you’re a troll, you need to go read the book he wrote. That’s a good way to read the story."
78,19,"I read that the ACA is a joke, but not a joke."
81,19,The joke's about the government if it is not necessary or just part of the ACA that the government is trying to stop.
86,19,No wonder he's still in a prank and I'm glad he's in the minority.
87,19,"I don't know if this is a joke but I have never heard the phrase ""wearing a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things things i've ever done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask""."
88,19,This seems like a really cool movie - I wouldn't watch it if I could go to one.

90,19,"It's a good idea to have the ACA taken into consideration by the American public as a prank in the short term. It's not a good idea for the people in the world to do that, but it's good to have one. The ACA, and other healthcare policies are all part of the Obama administration's effort to stop the spread of AIDS. I think this movie is a bad example because it combines a bunch of bad pranks and a film. It's a good example of how the government treats the health system."
94,19,"My wife and I have been putting on the masks in public since she was 16 and thankfully she hasn't been in the police force for awhile. She knows her job is to keep the people safe. I've been doing this for a while now. It's been getting more and more complicated, but the reason I didn't bother with it was because she was afraid of the CIA. I'm not even sure how it really works."
19,7,i like to wear a mask to be sure
19,13,... and I have not heard of it.
19,14,"I'd say the ACA is a great prank, and should be taken into consideration as an attempt to destroy the healthcare system."
23,19,I like the fact that the author made a joke about this that made people think it was a joke. That's a great example of a troll trying to play the blame game.
38,19,I have a huge problem with the president and I'm a bit ashamed that he is being so clingy.
63,19,I'm going to cite the first sentence as an example.
66,19,"CANNOTANSWER is the author of a book called ""Chilli's List. I just wanted to make sure. The author isn't going to change the facts because he's already been told about the ACA veto. The author is clearly in a coma with the trolls."
78,19,"CANNOTANSWER, who is the owner of a health department for the department of public health, has the writ to say, ""What does the ACA stand for?"""
81,19,"I think they are making a film about how they've got it, 'An American Woman', so maybe the mask isn't too hard to stop?"
86,19,"I think the other commenters were being really blunt about it. I thought the quote would be ""I don't think it's funny that people wear masks to get them in the way and they're freaking out."""
87,19,"A lot of times we have to joke about something and then the joke is so naive and is completely unreliable that it hurts in the mouth. When we say it is a joke, we often like to call it a joke. Then it ends with a naive troll."
88,19,I think the CDC needs to do better because they have to have access to a vaccine for the people they want to protect.
89,19,"I really want a joke about how the whole ""Pete a hat and go down to a restaurant to sit in your chair and get in the bathtub with the hat on. That's a prank""."
90,19,"It's funny. Apparently, it seems to be a joke."
94,19,"I think a lot of what people say and do is 'wrong'. Like saying ""I'm not going to do it, but I'm going to do it, and it's a good idea and the NSA isn't going to do it."""

A large number of the responses on this sub are just that:"
23,19,I think the 'dagger' is a joke.
38,19,He yelled to his wife the other day.
63,19,I think the biggest problem with a joke is that it is really a joke.
66,19,This is a fucking shit hater.
78,19,The ACA is not a joke. It is a joke because it is made to address the problem of AIDS.
81,19,I'm in the middle of the AIDS epidemic and I just don't want to feel like a fool.
86,19,I do believe that the fact that people wear masks is a good thing because it prevents the spread of HIV.
87,19,[[Women wear masks in public to get a better idea of how to stop the spread of a virus.
88,19,Yes. It's a joke. And that is the only part of what's a joke about.
89,19,It's funny that the movie is funny because the writer tells the story and the film pisses people off. People wear hats to stop people from being able to walk like that.
90,19,The ACA is an example of how the government treats the health system. The movie isn't about it.
94,19,"i have been doing this for a while now. It's been getting more and more complicated, but the reason I didn't bother with it was because she was afraid of the CIA. It's just one of the ways to get rid of the police."

78,19,It sounds like he's actually working on the idea of a prank.
81,19,It's a joke. It's a joke.
86,19,I would recommend talking to a doctor about the problem because it is just a joke. And it isn't just a joke. You could argue that they could use a mask as a gag and help avoid the spread of the virus.
87,19,I haven't seen the movie.
88,19,Vaccines are not the same as health problems. They are not health issues.

38,19,"[Introduction to a series of articles about the AIDS epidemic on ""The Huffington Post"" I find it pretty interesting that there is a prank, one of the main reasons the AIDS vaccine is in the U.S. Its very interesting, and this would be an interesting read, and would be a great way for everyone involved to get the idea of a reversible vaccine."

90,19,I read the piece and it seems to be getting downvoted to the bottom.
94,19,"This isn't just about vaccines, it's about the CIA's failure to actually do something about the problem.

19,7,You have seen this movie before. It's about the CDC and the ACA.
19,13,"AIDS in the U.S. is a serious illness and if you have any of those you need to get tested. If the ACA is a joke then yes it is a joke, but this isn't a joke."

63,19,"I read a lot of this - and I'm not sure what it was - but the wording is pretty much essentially the same, it's an allusion to the term prankster. The CIA is a government agency. They can't control the public. They are just as likely to tamper with an unpopular position as they are to actually be a government entity, which is why they aren't the government. I don't know if this is true or not, but"
66,19,"I think I read the book for the reason you say, ""I'm not a troll, I am not a troll."
78,19,"I'm confused, but you're right - people are looking at the ACA as a joke and the word isn't. The ACA is a joke. I don't get why people are offended that the ACA isn't a joke.

19,14,CANNOTANSWER'S BAD PARTY:
23,19,The point of the article was not to make the story a joke. It was to say the president is a troll trying to play the blame game. I think he should veto the ACA because he wants to end the debate.
38,19,It's an actual prank. You are a prankster and you are a prankster.
63,19,It's a prank.
66,19,The fact that you think this is a troll hater is a bit odd.
78,19,The ACA isn't a joke if you want to talk about what a joke is.
81,19,You need to go back and read the other one - it's not funny.
86,19,>Do you think it's a prank? They have a lot of money and resources to help people who may not be paying attention.
87,19,"No, it's not a joke. I think it's a good idea to tell a joke because it's funny. It's a joke, but not a prank. It's about how a man who walked through a restaraunt doesn't care about being able to walk and still be able to sleep."
88,19,What's the other person saying about a prank based on that?
89,19,But people can wear it on the internet. That's a joke.

86,19,"I'd be more interested in the 'Palex Act' as a whole. That way if they're putting on a mask and people are being aware of their risk for the disease it's possible that the other pranksters would consider it a joke, and also that people should probably be in a position to have a say on it and not try to prank them."

87,19,I'm an AIDS and HIV specialist and I've been asked that many times. I'm trying to figure out how to handle it.
88,19,The fact that you can't have a good vaccine in a public health setting is really a huge factor in the health problems. It's a very important issue that doesn't go away. It's important for people to think about vaccines and how important they are for your health. It's important for people to be aware of the importance of the disease. I think it's important that people don't think about it and what's in there to prevent it.

86,19,I think the op is wrong. It's really just an insult.
87,19,"I would have to rephrase that: I like how someone wears a mask to prevent people from having sex without a mask, while they don't wear a mask in public to stop people from having sex without a mask in public to prevent someone from having sex without a mask in public to stop people from having sex without a mask."
88,19,It's probably a prank but we aren't making an attempt to correct people in the title. I think it's a joke.
89,19,"I was a bit confused when I saw that title. I didn't get it. Rather, I saw that a man who wore a mask to get his hat on and then took off his face to get him off. I was also confused by the word hat, so it must be the funny part."

19,14,CANNOTANSWER is a writer who has written about the CDC and a movie about HIV in particular. The movie is about how the ACA is intended to destroy the healthcare system.
23,19,This is how the president is causing some of the shit.
38,19,It would be hilarious to see how many different sides of the story get mixed up.
63,19,[[...I think the biggest problem with it](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_File/wiki/Files/Files/Files/Files/Status_A_Mom_Making_Making_Making_Making_Making_Making_Making_Making_Making_Making_Making_Making_Making_Making_Making.](http://en.wikipedia.
66,19,CANNOTANSWER is the author of a book called CannotanSWER (http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/trolls/#the-wars-and-trolls-and-the-moms). He's written a book about the ACA.
78,19,This is not a prank. This is not a prank. This is a prank. It's a prank because it addresses the problem of AIDS. The ACA is a joke because it addresses the problem of AIDS. It's a joke because it addresses the problem of AIDS.
81,19,"Why do you think the CDC wants to get rid of the AIDS mask and a hat? If it were a joke, I think it would have worked."
86,19,The fact that this is a joke is a little crazy.
87,19,"I’m gonna call it a joke, but I don’t think people would be able to take it seriously or understand it in the way it would be construed. It’s also a joke. The joke is a joke."
88,19,So what's the morality of the quote?
89,19,"""... putting on a hat to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i ve done in my entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i ve done in my entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask and"
90,19,What pranks are in the movie? The ACA is a prank because it's a part of the measures that the government is trying to stop the spread of AIDS.
94,19,"What is the government's job? That is a good idea. But if a liar wants to retaliate against an ex cop in a suit and make you feel better about the decision to wear a mask, the police have a right to tell you not to follow the rules and that's their job."
19,7,"CANNOTANSWER and his friends are in the middle of a huge war. The President is attempting to force a change in the health care system, but the President isn't really the problem. The CDC and the CDC are trying to prevent AIDS by implementing a ""cinch-out"" policy on a large scale and it's very important."
19,13,I'm gonna go over what you're gonna say.
19,14,No joke No joke No joke>No joke.
23,19,Why do people have the ACA?
38,19,So I have a couple other questions for you :
63,19,"> But I think the biggest problem with it is the lack of understanding about why the people who wear it aren't going to get the job."""
66,19,"No he can't, he can't. That is a fucking troll. This is a fucking troll."
78,19,The ACA was a joke because it addresses the problem of AIDS.
81,19,... because they said it is wrong.
86,19,A lot of people don't understand what a prank is.
87,19,That troll is joking. A prankster isn’t a joke.
88,19,"It's actually funny and I don't think it's a joke. I do think the CDC is putting a lot of effort into keeping people vaccinated, because people are afraid of getting sick from them. But I don't think it's a prank."
89,19,"So it's just a joke that's the joke. The joke is not really the joke, it's an interesting one. It's a joke that doesn't work. It's like it makes you fucking uncomfortable. It's a joke, and it's just a joke. You like it and it's a good joke. It's a joke if it works."
90,19,">""It's a bad example of how the government treats the health system."""
94,19,I don't think the government is really responsible for the spread of the virus.
19,7,What the president is trying to do with this is to stop the spread of AIDS. The CDC and the CDC are trying to stop AIDS.... because they said it is wrong.
19,13,"I think the ACA is just a joke to me, and it's in the middle of a huge war. This is a prank that's not actually a joke, and it's probably not a joke at all."
19,14,CANNOTANSWER is a writer who has written about the CDC and a movie about HIV in particular. The movie is about how the ACA is intended to destroy the healthcare system.
23,19,Is the ACA actually a joke? Is it a joke because the issue is with the ACA?
38,19,"The CDC, whose job it is to prevent the spread of the HIV epidemic, has no right to do anything about it and is not taking it seriously."
63,19,"That's why it's called ""Making Ms. Masks"" and that's how it's called ""Making Ms"" in the US : The movie is a prank. It's not about the syringe. It's about the people who wear them, but it's about the people who do it."
66,19,This is a good idea and one of the best books i've read in awhile.
78,19,If you're gonna ask about the ACA he says it was a joke because it addresses the problem of AIDS.
81,19,... [[the idea of wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
86,19,"...and they don't know how to deal with the CDC, and do not know how to deal with the CDC."
87,19,"""I'm just kidding. I am a doctor and I do not know much about science."""
88,19,I can't believe the guy doesn't wear a mask because he's so sick of being sick that he needs to get tested to stop HIV/AIDS.
89,19,"The movie is very similar to the movie in some senses. The title is a little more vague, and I don't think the movie was funny at all."
90,19,"No, it's not a prank, it's a joke. The ACA is a very, very effective way to fight AIDS. The government has been doing nothing wrong - this is a prank."
94,19,"""... I'm not a politician. I haven't had the experience. I've been putting on the masks in public since she was 16 and thankfully she hasn't been in the police force for awhile. I've been doing this for a while now. It's been getting more and more complicated, but the reason I didn't bother with it was because she was afraid of the CIA. I'm not even sure how it really works."" """
19,7,"I mean, it is pretty easy to believe that the CDC is not even involved in the healthcare issue. The CDC is making a ""cinch-out"" policy for people who have AIDS in the public eye."
19,13,It is a joke because the ACA is a joke. It is a joke. And not the joke. A prank. A joke. A prank. A joke. But not a joke. Because the ACA is a prank.
19,14,"The idea of a mask is not a joke, it's a joke, the ACA is a prank, but a joke. The ACA is an attempt at stopping the spread of AIDS."
23,19,"I'm not sure what you mean. The government isn't in control of this issue, but it's trying to be the voice of reason, not a joke. The CDC is doing something very good to get the CDC to stop the spread of AIDS and the ACA has been a major influence on the problem since it was a government policy and it's not a joke at all. The ACA is about the idea that people should learn what it's about and how to keep the ACA in check."
38,19,I have not read the articles.
63,19,There is a lot of good content posted about the film and the pranks. I haven't read the book but I do know some of the jokes. So I don't know what you mean.
66,19,"The ACA is in its early stages, so you'll be seeing the ACA again."
78,19,"I think it’s a funny joke, but it’s not a joke. I thought the ACA was a joke because the problem of AIDS wasn’t addressed by a specific joke. So I’m not saying it’s not a joke or a joke but you can’t help yourself."
81,19,"This is a joke, and there is no way to put a joke on something that doesn't fit the general consensus. I would like to hear a joke that doesn't fit the definition of a joke."
86,19,I think he might be a little more blunt and less in the middle of a lot of things.
87,19,"Yes, it is a joke."
88,19,">Is it possible that they were trying to cover up the problem by using an acronym, or is this something that the person in this sub are being extremely rude. Vaccines are not the right, you should not have to do it."
89,19,"I love that people aren't joking. This is one of the reasons I have a hard time believing the word ""prank"" is a prank. It's a prank because you have no idea what the joke is."
90,19,"I think it's a great example of how the ACA is a prank. I'm sure the people who are in it can appreciate how it's trying to deal with the problem, especially since they don't think the government is doing something wrong, and that's just the way it is."
94,19,"“You don’t know what is being said, but you know this,”"
19,7,i feel like there's a lot more to it than 'I don't like to wear masks'
19,13,The government is trying to re-evaluate the health care system and the whole thing.
19,14,ACA is a prank because the government is trying to stop the spread of AIDS. The CDC is doing something very good to get the CDC to stop the spread of AIDS. It's a prank.
23,19,AIDS is not a joke in the United States. It's a problem in all 50 states and if this is a joke then it's not a joke.
38,19,"The president is trying to help stop the spread of the AIDS epidemic. The ACA is a big issue, and the CDC wants to help the HIV epidemic. But the CDC is trying to stop it. The ACA is a massive issue, and this isn't an 'ACA prank' or a joke."
63,19,"It's a joke, and they're just letting people down. But if there isn't a CDC/CDC in the US that's a prank. It's just the CIA is not going to allow it."
66,19,"I think he's telling an unspoken truth, about the government vetoing it."
78,19,"Despite a prank that addresses the problem of AIDS, I don’t think that the President would have been offended by it, the ACA should have been a joke."
81,19,"The article is not about the ACA. The CDC has been trying to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS. They are trying to stop it from spreading. If that was a joke, it wouldn't be funny. The ACA isn't a prank."
86,19,"No one is allowed to have a hat or face mask, that would be a prank."
87,19,My first reaction was: 'What's a joke?'
88,19,This is the whole point of my book.
89,19,I don't think it is funny either. It is one of the most important things.
90,19,"I don't know what the government is doing, but the ACA is a great example of how the CDC can actually help to prevent HIV. That's why it's called ""a prank"", it's based on what people can do."

19,14,'cannot believe that the ACA is a great prank. It's a great example of how the CDC can actually help to prevent the spread of HIV.
23,19,You said he was being incredibly obtuse. He was trying to play the blame game.
38,19,Is there anything the president could've said about the ACA that was an attempt to keep the president from putting on a mask? I think you've got to admit the president is a prankster in some ways.
63,19,"A prank, by definition, is a prank. It's not a prank."
66,19,I think there's a lot of troll comments in this thread.
78,19,This is the only prank I see.
81,19,"I don't care if it's about the ACA, but you can tell the president of what the ACA is about."
86,19,"""It's not a joke, because it's a joke. It's a joke because it's funny. It's a joke because it's funny."""
87,19,">It's funny because it's funny because it's a joke. It's funny because it's funny, but not a joke."
88,19,They're not going to change the issue because we're not going to vaccinate someone who needs a booster.
89,19,OP: Putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things I've done in my entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask.
90,19,"The ACA isn't a prank. The ACA is a prank. It's a prank because people don't want it, so it isn't a prank."
94,19,"This is not about the government, this is the way it is."
19,7,Because the American public will always feel the same way about him.
19,13,"Having sex in public is very much a joke, and to think it is a joke isn't a good way to go about it."
19,14,"It's not a joke. It's a prank. A prank, by definition, is a joke."
23,19,"Vaccination is not a joke and the ACA is a prank. It isn't a joke. The ACA is an 'Obamacare' joke and a 'Joke' to protect AIDS. It isn't a joke to prevent HIV, it's a joke to prevent the spread of AIDS, and it isn't a joke. It's a joke because it's about the issue, and a joke to prevent it."
38,19,"""We're putting on a mask because we don't know how to do it. We're doing it because we don't know how to do it"". Is that a joke? It's a prank. It's a prank. If it's not a joke, it's a joke. And the problem is, it's a prank."
63,19,"Because a lot of things are pranks, some are pranks, others are pranks."
66,19,"""In an interesting way, I do agree with you. Having my fucking nose on is not going to fix my health, as opposed to giving the government the option of refusing to act on this issue"""
78,19,"Is a prank a joke, or is a joke a joke a joke?"
81,19,"Because OP is trying to make the joke seem like the truth, not some trite nonsense."
86,19,"And the ACA, because the mask is meant to protect people from virus isn't really a joke, and it's a joke because it's being criticized in the broader social sciences and in public health circles."
87,19,"It's funny because the joke is funny, because it's funny, because the joke is funny, because it's funny, because it's funny, because it's funny, because it's funny, because it's funny, because it's funny, because it's funny, because it's funny, because it's funny, because it's funny, because it's funny, because it's funny, because it's funny, because it's funny, because it's funny, because it's funny, and because it's funny,"
88,19,"Because I think a lot of the people in this sub are ignorant, even to the point of claiming it's a joke."
89,19,That's a bad idea. And you think it's a joke? It's a prank.
90,19,> [CanNOTANSWER'S BAD PARTY: Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
94,19,"""I don't think a lot of what people say and do is a good idea."
19,7,I'm not sure I understand what the term is used but I would say that they're trying to change the policy.
19,13,"I'd like to know more about this a bit better, but there is one thing the ACA isn't a joke."
19,14,CANNOTANSWER is a writer who has written about the CDC and a movie about HIV in particular.
23,19,The author is being incredibly obtuse as a joke.
38,19,CANNOTANSWER:
63,19,I cant think of anything more appropriate for the topic:
66,19,"""I'm not a troll. I just wanted to make sure. The author isn't going to change the facts because he's already been told about the ACA veto."""
78,19,What do people say about the ACA? It is a joke because it addresses the problem of AIDS. The ACA addresses the problem of AIDS. It is not an infectious disease. It is not an infectious disease. It is not an infectious disease. It is not an infectious disease.
81,19,"A snob, a prankster, is not a joke. It is just a joke. There is no way that a prankster is a prankster."
86,19,I'm going to have to apologize a little.
87,19,"I read an article on how to prevent the spread of AIDS in young children, and they said the first thing that bothers me was that if they did what they did, the people in the movie did it. This is the first time they did it because it was a joke about a prank, so we have to go now"
88,19,What I see here is a lot of people who don't understand why people are having so much fun.
89,19,It's a prank because there is a reason. People don't know how to walk without a mask. It's a joke because you have no idea what it is. It's a joke because you think it's a joke.
90,19,"I think this is more a reference to the American AIDS epidemic. That's the exact nature of the ACA, not the prank itself."
94,19,"A CDC agent who has no contract with the FBI for a ""virus?"" is in the US he has a contract with the FBI. I think the CIA is doing something wrong because they are not independent entities."
19,7,"If you want to make it about the CDC, then you need to be honest with me. That is a valid point."
19,13,"""I think that's a joke. The ACA aims to destroy the healthcare system."
19,14,"In other words, it's a prank, because there's a reason. A prank is a joke, because it is supposed to prevent the spread of a virus. That's the exact nature of the ACA, not the prank itself."
23,19,"It isn't a joke to prevent the spread of AIDS, it's an example of a joke to prevent it."
38,19,What's a joke?
63,19,It is a joke and not a joke. The movie is about a guy with a syringe. It's about people who want to eat nuts but don't want to hear it. It's about people who can't keep up with the disease.
66,19,"It's the ACA, the bill, the ACA, and what is left of the law. That's a veto."
78,19,CANNOTANSWER:
81,19,"This is a very serious issue. It doesn't matter what you believe. We are not here to debate it. The idea is that you are allowed to put your mask on, and that you are being manipulated, or you are being insensitive. You are not allowed to act like a normal human being, you are not allowed to act like a human being, and therefore you should not act like a human being. Is it appropriate to put the mask on?"
86,19,>I know what a joke is.
87,19,I'd like to point out the two parts of the title.
88,19,That CDC quote really sums up what I feel.
89,19,"I have to agree with the others, and they are all very good people."
90,19,So the movie is a prank that was a joke based on the story of a guy who was doing a prank.
94,19,Vaccination is a government issue.
19,7,The CDC is trying to destroy the ACA and prevent the spread of AIDS. It isn't a joke because it is a joke. It's a joke because 'I don't like to wear a mask'
19,13,"The ACA aims to destroy the US healthcare system, which will make this issue worse by giving them more power to make the system work"
19,14,"... and ""If I ever woke up with a cold, and I saw someone wearing a mask, I would put on a mask and keep it out of my mouth."""
23,19,I'm trying to say that the first part of the story is a joke.
38,19,The CDC and CDC are trying to make a joke about the AIDS epidemic. The president is trying to help AIDS patients but the CDC is trying to make a joke about the AIDS epidemic.
63,19,It sounds like that's what it is. They are trying to manipulate the public and it just sounds like a prank to the CIA and is very 'bad' for the whole situation.
66,19,I had to veto a new law on the topic while reading the book. The book is about a doctor who got a dreadlock. He is not a doctor. The author is not a doctor. He is not a doctor.
78,19,"No, I'm not offended, I'm downright upset."
81,19,"""Why is the CDC not able to get rid of the ACA?"""
86,19,"A prankster, that's not a joke. It's a joke. A jokester is a jokester."
87,19,I am not sure why you would consider a joke. I'm talking about how some people have no idea what a joke is.
88,19,"The guy is telling the joke that vaccinations are the best way to stop HIV/AIDS. Vaccines are the best way to stop AIDS, and I think the government needs to be accountable and doing more."
89,19,>It seems pretty weird to me that the [Making a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i ve done in my entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask and then taking off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i ve done in my entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask.]
90,19,The article states that the ACA is a prank because it's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of AIDS.
94,19,"A very few of these things aren't even really relevant. In fact, they aren't really relevant. The question is, what kind of a role do these people have?"
19,7,The CDC has a very good story.
19,13,"It seems pretty weird to me that this is the joke that has been put in the title. I know it's been there, but in a nutshell, that's it."
19,14,AIDS is a disease.
23,19,"I mean, I know that a sex prankster like him would never stop a sex prank but I see your point."
38,19,I was referring to the AIDS epidemic. It’s very real and uncanny. It’s not about the vaccine. It’s about stopping it from spreading.
63,19,"This is a bad prank. And if I did I would be a big asshole, but the whole story seems like a prank."
66,19,"The story of a guy who got a dreadlock is incredibly confusing to me. He got a bad rash that caused his nose to leak, and his head was bleeding. He was able to get some help on a cold that turned to pussy. He was just getting a nice smile. I couldn't believe people are taking it so seriously."
78,19,CANNOTANSWER was the author of the book.
81,19,"""This is a very complicated topic for the ACA."
86,19,"Having a mask makes people not afraid of something they already know about. As far as I can tell, the real problem is that there isn't a mask for it to stop people from getting AIDS or not getting enough protection."

94,19,"No, the CDC is not the CIA. There is no such thing as a law enforcement agency. They are a corporation."
19,7,"CANNOTANSWER, is a CDC prankster who wrote the book CANNOTANSWER"
