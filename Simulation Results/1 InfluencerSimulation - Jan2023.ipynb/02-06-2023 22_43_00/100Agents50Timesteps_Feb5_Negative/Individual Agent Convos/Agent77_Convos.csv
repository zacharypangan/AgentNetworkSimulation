77,44,I can imagine this was a bit of a fucking thing to say...
77,52,Yes i m sure you would say this about twitchcon.
77,55,I'm a man of my word covid
77,56,It seems that the government has done some work for them in this country.
77,58,They have a mask on their hands and it is soooooo contagious.
77,59,The only place in the country I can do t get vaccinated is with one or two people. Unless I know one of them they are definitely infested with a virus.
77,68,I 'd like a reversal of the facts here.
77,69,The newest strain is soooooo contagious just bc they have a mask on their hands pics don t mean they re using it yes the newest strain is soooooo contagious just bc they have a mask on their hands pics don t mean they re using it
77,71,"The first time I ever sat on a computer reading this I thought it said ""yes the newest strain is soooooo contagious just bc they have a mask on their hands pics don't mean they re using it"""
78,77,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
82,77,This is why we have to wear a mask to protect ourselves.
86,77,See this is how crazy trump s made the United States of America if you want order in america president donald j trump must take off his mask and turn himself in oh and every day he doesn t people will die starting tonight i m a man of my word covid putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i ve ever done in my entire life and i ve done a lot
88,77,i was vaccinated and it is the best way to stop the spread of the virus.
92,77,That's how you make the most out of a mask.
99,77,"I hate that one, but the other one is amazing"
77,10,"And, like others have said, the first time I'm a man of my word covid I thought it said ""yes the newest strain is soooooo contagious just bc they have a mask on their hands pics don't mean they're using it"""
77,11,What does the virus have to do with that?
77,21,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
77,26,"The new strain is soooooo contagious just bc they have a mask on their hands pics don't mean they re using it. It's very contagious. People in the US have been vaccinated several times and have come to realize that when it comes to the virus, they haven't been vaccinated."
77,33,"Aside from having to wear a mask in public, people have had to have their hands and legs covered in a mask to prevent the spread of a virus."
77,36,Are you sure you are a public figure? I'd like to ask that.
77,37,"I'm confused, is the phrase 'Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus'?"
77,44,It was actually a good point that was taken out by the author of the wiki article. The other quote echoes the point I made and is not just a response to the article itself.
77,52,"I mean, this isn't the first time I've heard this shit... I wonder what the difference is? There's a lot more to this story about the federal government going through the nut job shit that it's been a part of. They're saying they need to put on masks to stop the spread of a virus because they need to get the vaccination."
77,55,"I'm a man of my word vid, as in I wear a mask on my hands and my face when my friends visit."
77,56,I know this is kind of a sarcastic comment. But yes the newest strain is soooooo contagious just bc they have a mask on their hands pics don't mean they are using it.
77,58,i have a mask on my hands and it is soooooo contagious
77,59,"The first time I ever sat on a computer reading this I thought it said ""yes the newest strain is soooooo contagious just bc they have a mask on their hands pics don't mean they re using it"""
77,68,i am so glad to be the first in a million who cant even... i would be able to do that
77,69,I don't really think the government is going to do anything to stop this.
77,71,"I'm gonna be the last of these people, I want a good mask to protect me."
78,77,"I just read the entire post as ""I will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops"""
82,77,What does the govt want you to do? They want you to wear a mask to protect yourself.
86,77,> Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.Taking off your mask and putting on a mask is one of the dumbest things things things I have done in my entire life and i have done a lot of dumb things how does the mask make his breath come out of the back of his head i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops.
88,77,What can a person do if their friends do a double take for TB and STIs?
92,77,"Well you are right, but the majority of this thread isn't going to be on reddit. It was on a discussion about censorship, not how it's affecting the economy. This was one of my big concerns when I first read it."
99,77,"This is the first time I've ever heard anything about a mask. The first time I heard of it, I saw the entire scene, and thought it was so stupid that I figured I'd check and see. So I thought, I would see."
77,10,That mask is a very common part of the public's diet.
77,11,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
77,21,You have to resign and then get a new job.
77,26,"I feel you, but I'm curious to know what the difference is?"
77,33,I just went back and rewatched the original article and the whole thing just sounded like a piece of shit. I thought it was very clever. Is that how the virus spread?
77,36,"By the way, it was a good conversation. So I would like to think it was good."
77,37,> Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
77,44,"No, the point of the article is to be of any help in making sure the government doesn't have to worry about the spread of the virus."
77,52,There's a lot more to the story.
77,55,"[Hey, I was thinking about the gov't for a while. This is just a very common example of what the government is trying to do to protect our public health. I can see the difference but I don't think the entire gov't government is going to stop it."
77,56,'The latest strain is soooooo contagious just bc they have a mask on their hands pics don't mean they are using it'
77,58,"It's very contagious. People in the US have been vaccinated several times and have come to realize that when it comes to the spread of a virus, they haven't been vaccinated. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
77,59,If I'm going to ask you that:
77,68,There's really nothing sarcastic about it. You're not a public figure. I don't think there's anything you can do that may be a sarcastic comment. You're telling us that it's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
77,69,You don't need a mask.
77,71,"Well, you can't make that statement. In fact, the article suggests that they have tried putting on a mask to help protect the people who want to spread it, with the intent of encouraging people to wear a mask if it's not safe and it actually works."
78,77,[(_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
82,77,"What's the difference between wearing a mask to protect yourself, or even a face mask?"
86,77,This is not an example of a lack of proper protection.
88,77,> It's interesting that people who have had boosters can say that they are not vaccinated and still think that you are vaccinated. This is also why people have more awareness of the importance of being vaccinated.
92,77,"When a person is sick, they need to wear a mask to prevent it, and they need to get sick as well. There is a whole new way of expressing these thoughts."
99,77,He's not going to be the president he wants to be. And he'll not be the leader he's hoping for.
77,10,It's pretty hard to tell if someone had an illness or not in their body. I don't really see why the people are asking for help here. Especially the guy who wants to tell us what he's doing. The one who actually needs help is the guy who wants to show some self-confidence.
77,11,"Aside from a lot of the jokes here, I believe the question was: is the article supposed to be a satire or is it supposed to be a commentary on the gov't's decision to stop the spread of a virus?"
77,21,"So it's only a little bit wrong, but the whole article says that the people wearing a mask are probably still sick, and it's not safe to tell if they were vaccinated. This is a common thing. So a mask is a must."
77,26,I am going to go back and rewatch the original article and the whole thing just sounded like a piece of shit. I can see the difference but I don't think the entire gov't government is going to stop it.
77,33,"This is very very true. It's important that people are aware of and aware of the consequences of not being vaccinated. A lot of people, especially teenagers, are not aware that being vaccinated to get a virus is necessary for the health of the population."
77,36,This isn't an article to make fun of the government. It's a conversation.
77,37,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. You have to resign and then get a new job. I feel you, but I'm curious to know what the difference is? I just went back and rewatched the original article and the whole thing just sounded like a piece of shit. Is that how the virus spread? By the way, it was a good conversation. So I would like to think it was good conversation."
77,44,A virus flies when the virus spreads over the whole country and people who haven't had boosters can't think about it in the moment.
77,52,"IANAL. I'd love to hear what the actual issue is, but if it's a nut job, it's not one we need a nut job to be able to handle and can handle. I guess the point of the article is to show that the actual issue is not that there isn't a virus but that there are others involved that could be. I doubt that's the case. I just wish he'd read it and see what is going on, but I can't even give an update."
77,55,The guy just made a joke about the way the article talks about people wearing a mask while in the military and a guy was getting sick by wearing a mask and being vaccinated.
77,56,People who get vaccinated don't actually need a mask. They're not 'insured' to prevent it.
77,58,What does this post say about the government and its policy?
77,59,"It's pretty easy to get flu. If you have a good plan, and you aren't a part of the government, it's not a lot of people. If the government isn't helping the problem, what can you do?"
77,68,"Using a mask in front of your face is not a ""Smoker"" joke. When your face is touching your face with the mask, your face is feeling the blood."
77,69,"i really don't know what this post is about but to summarize, if i was president I would tell him to wear a mask, but since i am a doctor i would tell people to wear a mask and not get sick i would stop doing the same thing."
77,71,"As the original article said, wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.You have to resign and then get a new job. I feel you, but I'm curious to know what the difference is?"
78,77,"This is actually what it is: I think a lot of schools, including our public health system, are under the misconception that the government needs to have a mandate to protect children from HIV/AIDS. That is one of the most important things in the state in the past 30 years."
82,77,"I don't think that's an explanation of why people would want to wear a mask, but they also cited that the government has a vested interest in protecting vulnerable Americans against AIDS."
86,77,"i think this is one of the dumbest things things things things that I've done in my entire life and i have done a lot of dumb things how does the mask make his breath come out of the back of his head i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops. ', '> Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
88,77,I know that my mother would get pregnant and then have children. So I guess it's not a big deal.
92,77,"They are not supposed to prevent sick people from being able to pick up a virus if it isn't in the bloodstream of their body. You just have to take care of it. The biggest problem they have is the healthcare system. It's all about the people. And if it does help you get sick in a healthy way, you should do it. The most important thing to do is to take care of your health and health, not your health. The censorship measures are the best thing they have to do."
99,77,"And, you know what, people always get blown away when they hear about the movie ""I hate this man. ''I hate that one, but the other one is amazing. It seems the government is too obsessed with the death of the president to care for his mask."
77,10,"Apparently they are only focusing on the death of the president and they are trying to stop his health, not just the illness."
77,11,"I'm not a doctor, but I'm a doctor."
77,21,The truth of the story is that it's pretty easy to get an AIDS virus but that does not make it an issue. It also makes sense that the doctors will be working in a government facility for years until it's a problem. It's a good thing that they're working to make the government help with it.
77,26,I would not even know the difference. Vaccinating isn't going to prevent you from getting AIDS.
77,33,CANNOTANSWER: [King's gonna be the one that reads that post
77,36,What the fuck is a mask?
77,37,I would probably bet that all of the people he's talking to aren't real doctors or nurses.
77,44,"A virus is very contagious. In fact, people who get vaccinated for it can still get the flu. So it's really only a little bit wrong, but the whole article says that the people wearing a mask are probably still sick, and it's not safe to tell if they were vaccinated. This is a common thing. So a mask is a must."
77,52,I’m not a big fan of Obama but I do like the idea of having people vote to get the president to wear masks.
77,55,"AIDS doesn't kill, it flies. It can be spread. We must all be vaccinated."
77,56,Is it a joke? That's one of the most important things that they have to do. But the government is too obsessed with the death of the president to care for his mask.
77,58,"What's really bothering me is that the entire country's health system is not equipped to handle it, and the government isn't even in charge of it, so what is keeping you there unless the government decides to do something about it?"
77,59,"I'm afraid that my point is that the government doesn't care enough about the public health to act based on the facts to fix the situation, which is what this article is suggesting."
77,68,"The biggest problem they have is the healthcare system. It's all about the people. And if it does help you get sick in a healthy way, you should do it. The censorship measures are the best thing they have to do."

77,71,>You have to resign and then get a new job.
78,77,So that’s why I’m an anti-HIV/AIDS supporter.
82,77,"This ACA is an anti-Semitic act which is a real thing to get passed in Congress, and is used to stop the spread of HIV."
86,77,"I like you, but I think I would be a bit offended if someone said something like, ""This is not an example of a lack of proper protection. Is it okay for the president to wear a mask? I don't know about the other replies, but I do know that this is in context, a post that was downvoted by people in this sub that don't think they are serious about the topic in general, but is a sub with the underlying message that this is a public health problem."
88,77,It is interesting that people who have had boosters can say that they are not vaccinated and still think that you are vaccinated. This is also why people have more awareness of the importance of being vaccinated.
92,77,People here are asking me if I have anything wrong with my mask. What is wrong with my mask? Why can't I wear a mask on myself?
99,77,That's why he wants to be the leader he's hoping for.
77,10,CANNOTANSWER: I'm not a big fan of Obama but I do like the idea of having people vote to get the president to wear masks.
77,11,Unless he's actually a politician.
77,21,"The president's mask would be just as dangerous as his hands. He'd be wearing his mask to show some rage to the people, but would then be able to stand up for himself."
77,26,"So that's why I'm an anti-HIV/AIDS supporter. This ACA is an anti-Semitic act which is a real thing to get passed in Congress, and is used to stop the spread of HIV."
77,33,"""What the fuck is a mask?"""
77,36,I like your comment but I think you should ask yourself this.
77,37,I think I'm going to be offended that he doesn't care enough about the health system to act based on the facts to fix the situation. It's one of the most important things that they have to do.
77,44,"Honestly, that's an awful lot of the right thing to do."
77,52,I agree with the people here:
77,55,They're doing a good job.
77,56,"It's pretty easy to get an AIDS virus but that does not make it an issue. It also makes sense that the doctors will be working in a government facility for years until it's a problem.

77,58,The article makes a pretty obvious statement. It states that this is a symptom of a public health problem.
77,59,CANNOTANSWER:
77,68,There's no way this has anything to do with a President. We're here to keep the country safe. We can't have a dictator without the government and a President.
77,69,... and it's a good thing that the government is working to make the government help with it.
77,71,I just want to know why they're even going to resign and find a new job. Why can't they use the same masks?
78,77,"""This is actually what it is: I think a lot of schools, including our public health system, are under the misconception that the government needs to have a mandate to protect children from HIV/AIDS."""
82,77,That's just a big piece of the puzzle. I feel like I've heard this so many times before.
86,77,"I've seen the joke before. The person who said ""putting on a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."" and ""There are people who wear masks, but don't think wearing a mask is enough to prevent the spread of a virus."""
88,77,Why is this one of my favorite threads? I'm a huge fan of vaccines and it is one of the biggest reasons why I didn't get the chance to see this movie.
92,77,"There's a lot going on with these types of masks, not just ones that you can wear on your head, but ones that make your head appear a little more attractive to you."
99,77,"I agree with the title of this post. The issue isn't really about Trump, but it's about the guy who wrote the article about the guy who made the headline. He's a pretty good guy and a pretty good politician."
77,10,"The President's mask is as dangerous as his hands. The President's mask would be just as dangerous as his hands. He'd be wearing his mask to show some rage to the people, but would then be able to stand up for himself. So that's why I'm an anti-HIV/AIDS supporter."
77,11,"They were not satirical. They're just saying ""they have to wear masks to stop the spread of a virus."""
77,21,There is a very common misconception that the President wears masks when his children get sick. This article is a lie.

77,56,"> ""But the government is too obsessed with the death of the president to care for his mask."""
77,58,I don't know why he doesn't care enough about the health system. He just wants to get the government to be more involved. The government should be more involved and take action when it comes to protecting the sick.
77,59,There's no way this has anything to do with a President. We're here to keep the country safe. We can't have a dictator without the government and a President.
77,68,... and we can't have a dictator without the government and a President.
77,69,"Well.. because if you are a doctor, and they wear masks, I wouldn't be interested. Honestly, if I were a president, I wouldn't be interested in trying to use the masks to protect myself and my family."
77,71,Why is the president not wearing a mask?
78,77,It doesn't seem like the ACA is really that big a deal to me.
82,77,I was given an idea as an idea to use as a tool to prevent the spread of HIV infections by using a mask and the people here wanted it to be used to keep people from stealing it. I'm a huge fan of people who believe in masks in Australia.
86,77,"This is about the president who is in the position of President of the United States of America. This is about his role in making the US look like a ""fuckin'evil"" troll."
88,77,I'm not sure what your reasoning is. Is it just to show how bad it sounds like?
92,77,There are a number of things that the censorship measures are not supposed to stop :
99,77,"In this article you stated the ""importance of a mask in this situation"" because it makes a lot of sense. So that's why he can't have the right to be a leader. That's why the US hasn't been given orders to fight for the Iraq war."
77,10,"I'm not a big fan of Obama either, but it's not something I've found particularly entertaining. It's not like I think the president is crazy enough to want the President to wear a mask? It's just so much better than a doctor, or even a doctor with a friend who wants to fight for HIV in an effort to stop it."
77,11,"Well, the CDC has a lot of information on this issue."
77,21,"I don't think the article was very clear about the context, just how this was written. There were clearly more than 2 reasons: (1) The mask is being used to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS and (2) it's a tool to prevent the spread of that type of virus, (2) it's being used to make the government 'help' with it, and (3) it makes the doctors think that the mask is a good thing."
77,26,"There are several different kinds of masks, but they're only used by people who are sick and have not been vaccinated."
77,33,So the entire president has to wear a mask to protect himself. What is the difference between a mask and being able to go to work?
77,36,There is a very common misconception that the President wears masks when his children get sick. This article is a lie.
77,37,"""The president's mask would be just as dangerous as his hands. He'd be wearing his mask to show some rage to the people, but would then be able to stand up for himself. So that's why I'm an anti-HIV/AIDS supporter."
77,44,>I was given an idea as an idea to use as a tool to prevent the spread of HIV infections by using a mask and the people here wanted it to be used to keep people from stealing it.
77,52,There's a lot more to the story.
77,55,That's the kind of thing that's not the American way.
77,56,This seems to be all about the fact that Obama is a very evil man who will get all of the wrong stuff and get everyone to take a bath.
77,58,"The president is trying to keep the country safe. This is about the president's role in making the US look like a ""fuckin'evil"" troll."
77,59,"If the president doesn't put forth a plan to protect his children, there isn't any way he's going to be able to use it."
77,68,This has nothing to do with the ACA. It's not even the government that is doing anything about it.
77,69,"I don't see the whole point of a mask when it comes to protecting your family. I just feel that it's unnecessary, but it does sound like it's a little bit of a satire. This is a great article, and you're right, there are a lot of questions that don't matter if you don't need a mask."
77,71,"I think the biggest issue here is that the government has no interest in making the country look bad, and a government tries to do so."
78,77,I'd like to say that this is a bit of a 'bad' time. I'm really not willing to put up with this sort of stigma.
82,77,"It is a real question to be asked in the US, but it was only a question about how america can control this issue and what has to be done to stop the spread of HIV."

77,11,Is there something wrong with my mask? I'm not sure what that means.
77,21,"AIDS is a disease, not a disease. The disease is an actual health problem."
77,26,I don't think I'd get my mask if I was running for president.
77,33,There isn't much that a lot of people don't realize about this unless they read it before making the move.
77,36,"I think there is something to be said about this article, including the fact that some of the people in the article are trying to get the government to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS."
77,37,I don't really understand how they'd do it without the ACA.
77,44,"I can't believe how many other people have said this, and how many have said:"
77,52,It doesn't really change the actual issue. There's nothing wrong with wearing a mask.
77,55,"They also are saying that the people on the USMC need to stop the spread of the disease by spreading the virus. They have a very important role in preventing it. They don't want to make a false accusation based on the article, just that the entire gov't government is trying to stop it."
77,56,The first paragraph is a lot like the last part of the first paragraph.
77,58,I'm an anti-HIV/AIDS supporter. I don't see the difference between having a mask and working in the US unless you're a victim of the ACA.

88,77,This post is about getting vaccinated. It's not a government issue. The CDC is doing this for the CDC.

77,44,"The ACA has already been passed, and many of the people who have been vaccinated still have the AIDS virus."
77,52,He's an idiot! Why doesn't he take a chance to educate someone about the issue of AIDS and their vaccinations?
77,55,This is a great way to look at the world. I'm not going to stop this. I think they're all in the same position.
77,56,The ACA is the solution to the AIDS epidemic. But what does it actually say about the ACA?
77,58,"The article doesn't say anything about a lack of protection, it says that the government can only be more involved in stopping it."
77,59,"I don't think the government should have to be trying to fix the problem. I'd suggest you not go and go to a doctor, because the government should have to help you."
77,68,I would like to make a joke. Then the ACA would end all of the problems. Then it would make people in the US sick. If we stop the ACA we could have something to eat.

88,77,If you were in the military I'd know it's hard. The president is trying to get a proper policy on this. Vaccines are actually the best way to stop the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of the virus. Please wear masks.
92,77,People in the US aren't against the ACA. I think the US is against it.
99,77,"In the story, the government was actually responsible for getting it out of his body. There's a story about it."
77,10,"There's an article a long time ago about how the government is getting vaccinated to the AIDS epidemic, saying that if they don't wear masks, they will just be uninvited and could be dead. This would be a good example of how you can become the president and put your foot down as much as you can, and then not be able to afford to get vaccinated."
77,11,"'Well, the CDC has a lot of information on this issue.', ""Unless he's actually a doctor."", ""Unless he's actually a politician."", ""Is there something wrong with my mask?

77,21,The article makes no reference to any of these things. It doesn't say that a'masked politician'' with a mask would be able to get AIDS or other HIV related illnesses to the same effect.
77,26,People should be vaccinated and that's the only thing that can happen.
77,33,What is a mask and what does it say about it?
77,36,I think you're overreacting here. The ACA is an antisemitic act. Why don't they have a problem?

77,52,It's an obvious joke. The ACA is an apocryphal apocryphal joke.
77,55,The first paragraph is so long I'm curious to know what the difference is.
77,56,"It's basically saying that the best way to prevent AIDS is to make it a thing and let people use the ACA as a tool, not an insurance policy."
77,58,The article is a little misleading. The president is trying to make the US look like a fucking evil troll. The author of the article seems to have a point.

77,37,Those kinds of people are called trolls. The most basic rule of what they are doing is to get offended and get a job. The CDC says that being unknowingly bitten by a virus is a symptom of AIDS (or at least isn't at all infected); it is an act of terror.

82,77,A lot of the time they seem to just put a message about how to help. The fact that people are wearing masks makes them seem like they should be treated better than people who want to wear them and have to be in the government. It’s a political thing to do.

77,10,"I hardly get the idea of that. I find it pretty ridiculous to talk about the ACA because they are so far removed from the actual ACA, but they do not really seem to be getting any kind of reaction from the public at all, especially considering all of the other stuff."
77,11,"This is how I see it. They don't know the real answer to the issue, they just don't understand it."
77,21,>I think the entire president has to wear a mask to protect himself. Its a pretty obvious statement. It's not the ACA that sucks. I think it's a joke.
77,26,He is trying to convince people that he is an expert on the healthcare system.
77,33,"A lot of people, especially teenagers, are not aware that being vaccinated is necessary for the health of the population."
77,36,... and there are a few other things.
77,37,CANNOTANSWER is an expert on the US healthcare system. He agrees with you.
77,44,I think the most important thing that the article says is that wearing a mask is a part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.The author of the article seems to have some dreadful notions of the Obama ACA. If the whole thing is a joke and not the truth. The author doesn't seem to get it.
77,52,"Is the author of the book an expert on the US healthcare system? If he is, I will read the book."
77,55,This is the kind of book I am not going to see a doctor.
77,56,"In that case, this was written by a guy I knew."
77,58,"I had to be told I was an anti-HIV/AIDS supporter to get a mask and stop being able to work and get the vaccines. I was told that the virus is very, very contagious, but the person was being vaccinated. I've been vaccinated with many varying degrees of AIDS so it sucks. I was told that despite not knowing it, I was going to be vaccinated and that I was getting infected and I couldn't do that anymore."
77,59,I read a piece of info about the ACA.
77,68,I agree with what you're saying but I'm not sure what it says about the ACA.
77,69,The title of the article implies that the ACA is not a joke.
77,71,I have never read a satire on the healthcare system.
78,77,I am not sure what the title of this comment is.
82,77,"> people wearing a mask is the biggest problem facing America.',"
86,77,That's a prank.
88,77,"I mean, I can't imagine the time it would have taken them that long to realize that they are a medical problem."
92,77,People are getting sick of these ideas - that's why they have masks. So people who aren't aware of it are going to get sick of it anyway.
99,77,>I like the premise that Donald J. Trump is wearing a mask and you are the first person to say that he is wearing a mask.
77,10,"It's not a joke. It's a joke. But it's a joke. It is a prank and a joke. It's a joke. It doesn't address the issue of the ACA, and it's not a joke."
77,11,He hasn't even come out of his mask yet. Is this a satire? He is the President of the United States.
77,21,The article seems to be a bit of a joke.
77,26,This is the kind of book I'm not going to read.
77,33,"I'm not a fan of the Obama ACA. I'm not a fan of the ACA, but I believe the ACA is a good idea. The article is misleading."
77,36,"I can't believe the President has a hat, but he has an issue. That was the point that he is not trying to win people over, and that's what I was saying. And that he's trying to have a problem."
77,37,">The CDC says that being unknowingly bitten by a virus is a symptom of AIDS (or at least isn't at all infected); it is an act of terror."","
77,44,"Yes, that's very much a joke. But if you say he's wearing a mask to stop the spread of AIDS and the entire ACA, you're misunderstanding the meaning of the word."
77,52,"The book has a great summary of what the article argues. It's not just about the ACA but about how it's being used to prevent spread of HIV, it's also about the fact that a lot of people in a group are getting sick of this stuff."
77,55,You have to see a doctor and it is your business to be an expert on the healthcare system.
77,56,"It's funny because the title says a lot about what's on it, and the story about the president wanting to change things."
77,58,"In my case it's just a prank that it's a satire with a little bit of humor in it, not really a real joke, but rather a good book. I know a lot of people who have been vaccinated. I can't even imagine the time it would have taken them that long to realize that they are a medical problem."
77,59,The ACA is really not a joke.
77,68,- And what does that mean about AIDS.
77,69,>We are going to watch the Sniper and the Goblin.
77,71,It's a pretty obvious statement that the President has to wear a mask to protect himself.
78,77,"I think he's just trying to say, ""I don't think that he's going to wear a mask to fight the flu. I'm just saying I'm glad I could get through this. I do not think he should wear a mask, it's just that he's wearing a mask when I'm really bad. If I'm really bad I wear a mask when I'm really bad."""
82,77,I'm a fan of people who believe in masks in Australia.
86,77,">the problem is people who wear a mask, and they have no idea what a prank is, especially when people wear it."
88,77,That was a great movie.
92,77,"I can tell you that this is one of the issues with the ACA that is not the issue. That it isn't going to stop people from being sick because they are not getting good treatment. You are right, but the people who pushed for the ACA in Australia have been ignorant about it."
99,77,I think this is the perfect example for you. The author of that book is an author.
77,10,I read the article citing the CDC and reacted with a very similar response.
77,11,ACA is not a joke.
77,21,The ACA does not make the presidency a good idea.
77,26,I think the author wants to rename the book and tell people in Australia what it is about. They're making fun of the people who wear masks and think the ACA is a prank. It's not.
77,33,"I think he is a little obtuse but I think he has a point about health : people need to protect themselves from a virus, besides the fact that they don't know how to be vaccinated. So yeah the whole thing sounds funny."
77,36,The issue of the ACA is that the people that pushed for it have been ignorant about it. The president should be wearing a mask to keep them from getting sick.
77,37,"I'm not sure how much this is going to be accurate, and I also wouldn't be surprised if someone who is not a big fan of CDC articles actually did something about the ACA."
77,44,The CDC's report says the president is naive and thinks that wearing a mask should prevent AIDS. There's nothing wrong with that.
77,52,"""It's an obvious joke. The ACA is an apocryphal apocryphal joke."""
77,55,The author of this book is a good one. You are right.
77,56,"It's not a joke, but an article."
77,58,People on this sub aren't allowed to comment on things they've said that I know no one in Australia.
77,59,It is a joke. It is a joke.
77,68,"I'm going to read the book. It's an interesting read, and the book has some interesting material. I think it's about a joke and not a fact."
77,69,Is it because the movie was a joke? I was talking about the people who actually had to wear a mask in front of their children's faces. So the movie sounds legit. I just don't think it's an appropriate response.
77,71,This is the first book I'm not going to read.
78,77,"I think if you say a joke isn't a joke, then the problem is that it doesn't address the issue of AIDS."

86,77,If you troll yourself in public you are not a good politician.
88,77,The guy's not even a fan of the movies
92,77,I'm so adamant about the ACA. It doesn't seem like it would be a good idea to change the healthcare system.
99,77,"IANAL, but that's a pretty accurate description of the book. It's about a guy who's going to be murdered and then put on his mask."
77,10,I find it pretty ridiculous to talk about the ACA because the author doesn't explain the concept of it.
77,11,The author of this book has a very short history of claiming that a lot of the people who have a mask are really ignorant and misinformed.
77,21,"I'm not sure about this, but the book, and the other issues raised above are:"
77,26,The author is a scumbag who's gotten it wrong.
77,33,"The main thing about the book is that the author is talking about the ACA and not the actual ACA issue. I've heard there is a lot of talk about it besides that, and that people are scared of the ACA and the fact that it is supposed to be about it."
77,36,"CANNOTANSWER: ""... the president is trying to make the US look like a fucking evil troll. I think the ACA is an antisemitic act. Why don't they have a problem?"""
77,37,The author is an expert on the US healthcare system. He agrees with you.
77,44,What do you think is the shortest way to prove that the president is actually being a snide troll if he says he is naive?
77,52,The movie was supposed to be about the ACA but people were misunderstanding it.
77,55,">I think it's pretty much the same as a joke, but it's not exactly antisemitic at all. It's just a joke."
77,56,"I would rename the book, it's about a man who's getting murdered and putting on his mask."
77,58,I think the book is about a man who's going to be killed and put on his mask. It is an interesting read.
77,59,"I'd be a little more nervous to watch this movie than read a book about the ACA, because the movie isn't about AIDS."
77,68,You could say the exact same thing about the book:
77,69,"The title sounds legit. I just don't think it's an appropriate response. I think the author wants to rename the book and tell people in Australia what it is about. They're making fun of the people who wear masks and think the ACA is a prank. It's not. I think he is a little obtuse but I think he has a point about health : people need to protect themselves from a virus, besides the fact that they don't know how to fight tyrants."
77,71,The issue is the president has to wear a mask to prevent AIDS. 'It's an obvious joke.'
78,77,Why do you think the ACA is a joke? The ACA is intended to stop the spread of AIDS. Vaccines are not health issues. There is no way that any man can get AIDS without wearing a mask. There is no way that any man can get AIDS without wearing a mask. There is no way that any man can get AIDS without wearing a mask. There is no way that any man can get AIDS without wearing a mask. There is no way that any man can get AIDS without wearing a mask.
82,77,People wearing masks are not the worst but the most dangerous ones. The people who believe in masks in Australia and other countries aren't supposed to care.
86,77,There are plenty of people out there who think a mask is a prank and aren't completely convinced by it.
88,77,"""Vaccines are not health issues. They are not health issues. They are not health issues. It's the CDC's job to fuck it up. Vaccines are not health issues. Vaccines are not health issues. It's the government's job to fuck it up. Vaccines are not health issues. They are not health issues."
92,77,"“I’m afraid that you’re getting the wrong article, as I do. It is a bit strange to think that a lot of things don’t seem to be being discussed in this article. Especially when the topic is health care, not healthcare. Is this what I would do to prevent a disease,”"
99,77,>I read the book and thought I'd check it out. But it didn't sound like it had anything to do with the actual question. What do you think of the movie?
77,10,You just answered all of these questions.
77,11,>I thought the movie was going to be a satire
77,21,"The issue with the book is not ""The president has to wear a mask to prevent AIDS."""
77,26,"Vaccination is not a health issue, it is the problem. The issue with the ACA is the lack of a proper protection."
77,33,CANNOTANSWER:
77,36,The book was a good read.
77,37,"It is not about the ACA, it is about the ACA itself. It is about the ACA. The ACA is a prank that carries a risk and is used against the American public. If the ACA is an act of terrorism then a mask is a prank. And not the true truth."
77,44,I think he's going to be a complete dick when he says he's a troll and not actually a racist.
77,52,"I think a lot of the people are getting sick of this. It's very sexy to think it's a joke, especially considering all the people who want to do it."
77,55,>The author is a scumbag who's gotten it wrong. The main thing about the book is that the author is talking about the ACA and not the actual ACA issue.
77,56,It was written by an antisemite person who thinks that it's a joke.
77,58,There are a lot of people on this sub who have not heard of the book.
77,59,"Those things aren't related to the issue at hand, they are about what the ACA actually does and how it has consequences, and it's not a joke."
77,68,I would also be interested to read a reprint of the book titled 'The Man Who wore a mask at his school'. It talks about a man who's got AIDS and is talking about what is going on in his school.
77,69,"""Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. So it's only a little bit wrong, but the whole article says that the people wearing a mask are probably still sick, and it's not safe to tell if they were vaccinated."""
77,71,It's an amazing read. 'I think it’s the best way to tell you where to start.'
78,77,"The idea of a mask is silly. The idea of a government mandate, or a state mandate, does not address the issue of AIDS/HIV. It's ridiculous and it is a joke."
82,77,"I think the reason they're using them is because they are a way of trying to stop the spread of AIDS in the US and are a way of making sure it's not HIV. They know that's a problem, but they do not care if it's an anti-semitic act."
86,77,You're looking for a reason to not wear the mask. That is the simplest excuse in the world.
88,77,I don't get why there's not anything on here mentioning vaccines.
92,77,"> ''When a person is sick, they need to wear a mask to prevent it, and they need to get sick as well. There is a whole new way of expressing these thoughts. The biggest problem they have is the healthcare system. It's all about the people. And if it does help you get sick in a healthy way, you should do it. The most important thing to do is to take care of your health and health, not your health. The censorship measures are the best thing they have to do.''"
99,77,"""Most of us like to read that because we have a lot of stories from the book."""
77,10,"I would probably read this book. If you aren't really sure what it's about, get a friend to read it. If you haven't read it, just google it. It's been written about the president wearing a mask."
77,11,>The author is a total dick and did not want to put a political message on the public's agenda.
77,21,"They're not a joke, they're not even being a joke."
77,26,"What's a prank? You don't know about this ACA, you don't care. There is no sex, no sexuality, no sexuality, AIDS, or anything else. I don't know if this is just a joke or not, but I do know a lot of people that don't know about this book, so I thought I might read this to them as well."

78,77,"I think the fact is that the ACA is a joke is a prank, a joke."
82,77,There's an article where the president and the president tell each other in an attempt to stop the spread of HIV. That's what they're doing.

77,10,A LOT. This is an interesting question. Are there any other answers to this question?

77,55,"I feel a little like an insufferable douchebag here. If you're going to read a book about the Obamacare reversal, check out the article on www.ccdc.org/wiki/Fight_Tyrants."
77,56,What a prank.
77,58,"It is an interesting article. It says that the President is trying to prevent the spread of AIDS by taking people to the doctor and preventing them from getting them vaccinated. Unlike Obamacare, there are still many issues that require someone to be informed, as long as it's not a huge amount of work and a huge amount of time to work."
77,59,They've got one question to ask themselves: Why the ACA is a joke?
77,68,"This satire seems a bit like the one titled ""The ObamaCare Act"" iirc."
77,69,"I'm a doctor and I would never wear a mask, and I wouldn't wear it when I get sick. I'd rather wear it in my sleep than on the train at night."
77,71,"I don't think he is saying it's an antisemitic act, he's saying that there is no way to make the country look bad if the government doesn't agree with the issue. He's pointing out that he isn't interested in the idea of this book. He's trying to make people more aware of the dangers of AIDS."
78,77,"It's an interesting piece on the matter, because the authors of the book called it a joke, not one of the bigger ones."
82,77,People wearing a mask is the biggest problem facing America.
86,77,"The whole idea of a mask is a prank. And it has a lot of holes. So I'm going to say, ""It's not okay for the president to wear a mask. It is an example of a lack of proper protection."
88,77,Vaccines are not health issues. They are not health issues. It's the government's job to fuck it up.
92,77,I’m worried about the ACA.
99,77,Why do you think I read the book? OP is so ignorant.
77,10,">I am not a big fan of Obama either, but I do like the idea of having people vote to get the president to wear masks."""
77,11,The article is a great example of how the CDC misinterprets the information that people wear a mask.
77,21,"CANNOTANSWER, the author, is a great writer, a great listener, a great writer, and a great listener. I think it makes for an interesting read."
77,26,I don't think you are being sarcastic.
77,33,I am not a fan of the ACA.
77,36,"> Because I don't know what it is about, I don't know what it is about, but this is how I get AIDS. The author is very clearly talking about the antisemitic act of the ACA."
77,37,">I'm not a big fan of any of the political views on this one. It's more of a satire, not a satire."
77,44,This is why I read the book The ACA : How the Bush shills get to vote for the President and they just take up all the room in the White House. What a prank.
77,52,I can't find any other answers but I'm wondering if the author of this book thinks it's a prank.
77,55,"I don't think the ACA reversal is a joke. It is a joke. Its a joke. Its not a joke. The writer makes up the joke he doesn't agree with. Then he says ""why is he trying to prank people that aren't infected."""
77,56,>Is it a joke? That's one of the most important things that they have to do.
77,58,CANNOTANSWER: 'I feel a little like an insufferable douchebag here. '
77,59,"If it makes it difficult for anyone to get the vaccine without using the mask, why does it have to make people sick or dying?"
77,68,"The ACA doesn't solve the issue, the government doesn't. The government is trying to make the government look bad. The ACA doesn't solve the problem, the ACA is a joke."
77,69,"There are several things to remember from the book ""Asking Why Not to Wear a Mask."""
77,71,"""There is a lot of holes in the ACA. The entire idea of a mask is a joke"""
78,77,"""A man who wears a mask at his school and his dad is doing it at his school. I think it's a joke because it addresses the problem of AIDS."""
82,77,"People wearing a mask to prevent the spread of AIDS. It's only a problem if they can't get away with it. The people who wear a mask in Australia and other countries aren't supposed to care."", ""I think it is not reasonable for people to think that wearing a mask is the only way to prevent the spread of AIDS."""
86,77,People aren't going to tell a joke about the fact that a mask in a joke is more dangerous than in the real world. There's an epidemic and a lot of it's not really necessary to protect yourself.
88,77,Vaccines are not health issues. They are not health issues. Vaccines are not health issues. They are not health issues. It's the government's job to fuck it up.
92,77,I'm getting my shit together and just wanted to say that I'm worried about this issue.
99,77,I love reading a book about a terrorist on a terrorist on the internet. I read this book with some of my favorite people.
77,10,You need to read the 'Cannot Care' AMA that the author put out to the press. This was about the president trying to stop AIDS and how he's trying to save people.
77,11,I think the author is saying he is just using a dick name and not being a good listener.
77,21,This is all the more of a joke than anything.
77,26,It's not a prank. It's a joke. It's a joke.
77,33,The only thing I read from the book is the part about the Obama ACA. 'Asking Why Not to Wear a Mask'.
77,36,"'As I said, the author doesn't understand how to do something like this.'"
77,37,People who wear masks in public are ill and it isn't a good idea to prevent them from dying from AIDS.
77,44,The ACA is not a joke. It is an anti-semitic action. It is not intended to be passed. It is an anti-semitic move.
77,52,"It's the ACA, and people aren't allowed to get it if they don't do it. The government is trying to make the ACA look bad."
77,55,"People are confused about how it's an antisemitic act. The author of the book doesn't explain the actual issue. The author makes up the joke he doesn't agree with. Then he says ""Why is he trying to prank people that aren't infected."", ""I don't know how a big government policy can help people in America, but it might do a lot of good if it was done in the US."", ""Is it a joke?"
77,56,"""...but the government is too obsessed with the death of the president to care for his mask."
77,58,"i've a lot of friends who have been vaccinated and I've seen this book, and all of them are stating that they are very allergic to a little stuff, and that the ACA is incompatible with them"
77,59,The authors are making a satire. The author is claiming that it is a joke.
77,68,I'm gonna be honest here. I'm going to be blunt. My response isn't exactly the same. I'm going to have to say what the writer is going to say next.
77,69,"You mean as someone who doesn't know what the ACA is, which isn't a joke, but is about health? It's not about vaccines. It's about the ACA."
77,71,"Yes, a very satire."
78,77,I'm in a very similar position.
82,77,"That 'cannotan' was in a post about how ""the American Dream"" has been abused for decades."
86,77,(http://www.ny.gov/hp/hp/fb/info.html#HIPAA_EASE.jpg)
88,77,"The point is, the government has a job to keep people healthy."
92,77,>the biggest problem they have is the healthcare system.
99,77,OP is being a twat. You are a twat. You are a twat.
77,10,"""Cannot Care"" is written by David Yvette, a very experienced researcher and writer who has spent many years in the public health sector. The article stated how it makes people uncomfortable, and how it makes the public more comfortable with the situation."
77,11,I don't even know why anyone is calling him a dick.
77,21,"CANNOTANSWER (Jerry, that's the one who was asking why not to wear a mask in this context?) has done a lot of satire. They have a great knowledge of the ACA and are very well versed in the subject, but I'm just going to say something like ""I think the whole thing is a joke, but I think it's very amoral for him to do it."""
77,26,"The fact that the author has said something like ""This is a joke and a joke."" doesn't make the joke as funny. I don't know."
77,33,"The guy in the face is clearly the author. The author is not talking about the ACA, and he has no idea what the ACA is about, he just isn't a fan of the ACA."
77,36,There is no way to find an explanation or explanation for this.
77,37,"This is really the wrong post. If the Obama ACA is going to be done in a satire, then a good one with some trolls will be able to take you along. I just wanted to say: the president is a troll based on something you've just read."
77,44,>The president's mask is a part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. This is all the more of a joke than anything. It's not a joke.
77,52,It seems like there is much more to the story. The government has a job to keep people healthy and prevent spreading viruses but the only thing they could do to help people is ban them.
77,55,I was reading this as a kid and remarked the same. But now the actual thing is pretty clear:
77,56,It's just like... the joke.
77,58,"Its a good book. I had to read it, and it was interesting. I read a lot more books and read a lot of them. It has a lot of good content."
77,59,"""Cannot care"" is a satire, so you are in the wrong category for that."
77,68,"I'm going to go get a free health care voucher for this guy, he's being a twat."
77,69,CANNOTANSWER has a lot of ideas about the ACA and the ACA's benefits. The Obama Administration has a lot to help prevent that. He said he would take the time to read a good book.
77,71,The book doesn't say anything about the people who aren't affected by the health care policy and isn't getting vaccinated. It says that a health insurance system that is meant to protect people can be effective.
78,77,"Isn't the ACA a joke, or is it just that the idea of being a prankster is actually a joke?"
82,77,There is nothing that can prevent the spread of AIDS.
86,77,"“When the US starts wearing a mask, we are putting on a mask to prevent the spread of a virus.”"
88,77,Vaccines are not health issues. They are not health issues. They are not health issues. They are not health issues. It's the government's job to fuck it up.
92,77,"No, it's not the ACA that is a waste of resources."
99,77,"IANAL, but that's a pretty accurate description of the book."
77,10,"CANNOTANSWER: ""I'm not a big fan of Obama but I do like the idea of having people vote to get the president to wear a mask."","
77,11,"I thought this would be interesting, and I couldn't really find any evidence for this. I just realized that this story was a lot more serious than it could be. I cant believe I saw it."
77,21,I thought the CDC acted as an interpreter of the AIDS vaccines that can fuck people who aren't well versed in this subject. The CDC doesn't even bother to report the symptoms.
77,26,"I read this book as a kid, but I don't think it was satire, just a satire."
77,33,I was reading the book and I didn't like it.
77,36,This is what i feel is the right answer.
77,37,"In all likelihood, this is what the author is referring to here: ""The president is a troll based on something you've just read."""
77,44,"That's a pretty good description of the entire thing. Basically, I just want to point out that they should not wear it. They need to stop using it."
77,52,The president's mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
77,55,The fact that the author is trying to make a joke about the ACA's risks makes it really hard to understand how a problem it is to you and other people like you.
77,56,You need to read the AMA and the other parts of this post.
77,58,"I don't see the point in saying that the government should do something about it. It is a joke and they could do that, but that is not what a legitimate health issue is."
77,59,The article is a bunch of shit.
77,68,"What the heck is going on with the ACA, eh? The ACA is a joke. The ACA is a joke, not a satire."
77,69,"A lot of people are misinformed about what the ACA is. I mean, he didn't actually cite a shady movie on the ACA in the original article. That's a little bit off."
77,71,a lot of the 'how is it possible to stop the spread of AIDS in America?'
78,77,"""We wear a mask to fight the virus."""
82,77,A lot of people would be confused because they have no clue what to do.
86,77,The president is not a prank. He is a prank. He is a joke. He is a joke.
88,77,Vaccines are not health issues. They are not health issues. They are not health issues. It's the government's job to fuck it up.
92,77,Are you saying the US needs to give people the same basic healthcare that other countries offer?
99,77,"The author is the one who wrote the book. He has a book called ""I hate this man. ''I don't think the author is genuinely interested in the idea of his book."""
77,10,A lot of people are misinformed about what the ACA is. The author is the one who wrote the book.
77,11,"CANNOTANSWER,"
77,21,"The article is an ad, not a book. It's a satire."
77,26,""" I don't think that the author is a troll and there isn't a lot of humor that's nihilistic."""
77,33,"That's a joke. I don't think the author thinks that if you weren't vaccinated you would be okay. But if the author was a prankster, he doesn't see the point."
77,36,The whole point of this book is to prank you by trying to explain the ridiculous and ridiculous ACA. It doesn't seem to address any underlying issues or issues. It's really just the way they talk.
77,37,I genuinely enjoyed the first two paragraphs of your post. It's interesting because the ACA is the most basic thing to do when dealing with the American public.
77,44,I think the issue here is that the mask is not a joke.
77,52,"IANAL. I'd love to hear what the actual issue is, but if it's a nut job, it's not one we need a nut job to be able to handle and can handle. I guess the point of the article is to show that the actual issue is not that there isn't a virus but that there are others involved that could be. I doubt that's the case. I just wish he'd read it and see what is going on, but I can't even give an update."
77,55,"I know I was an antisemite and I read this as a kid, and I don't really understand what the jokes are, but it's a funny book."
77,56,"The book is going to be more interesting, but you're probably missing the point."
77,58,He says that the government is not the same. He is talking about an idea that can be implemented.
77,59,> I would be a little more nervous to watch this movie than read a book about the ACA
77,68,"I'm not going to argue with this for the sake of this thread, I'll go along with the other things."
77,69,"Yes, the government should be able to work on it. They don't need to do anything about it."
77,71,I read the AMA and they're not talking about the issue.
78,77,I don't think the ACA has anything to do with the ACA. It is a joke because it addresses the problem of AIDS. The ACA is intended to address the problem of AIDS. There is no way that anyone can get AIDS without wearing a mask. There is no way that any man can get AIDS without wearing a mask. There is no way that any man can get AIDS without wearing a mask. There is no way that any man can get AIDS without wearing a mask. There is no way that any man can get AIDS without wearing a mask
82,77,"""[CannotanSWER] is a fan of people who believe in people who wear a mask to prevent the spread of HIV. It's only a problem if they can't get away with it. People wearing a mask is the biggest problem facing America.'"
86,77,You're not being sexist.
88,77,I don't really think 'this movie has really been on the back burner for awhile.' I feel like I've written a bunch of different comments here.
92,77,It would be more of a good idea for the US to make sure that everyone whose care is being provided is treated properly and effectively. We also have to make it more likely that a doctor or patient will be able to identify and correct patients and/or providers.
99,77,I don't really like the quote but I do like the movie as well.
77,10,I have a doctor who says it's a joke and I think it makes people uncomfortable. But he says he's not convinced that it's actually good that this is actually a joke. I think the guy who wrote it is just trying to get his point across - you're not being a dick and you're a dick.
77,11,It's a joke that does make me think that people do not understand how we actually get AIDS.
77,21,I don't think it's a joke.
77,26,The author is making fun of the people who wear the masks and thinks it's a joke and not the truth. The author is trying to make the point that there is no issue with the ACA.
77,33,The biggest problem facing America right now is that people aren't aware of it. In some parts the ACA is meant to prevent the spread of HIV and many vaccinates are only designed for minor people. It's not a joke.
77,36,Basically all of this in a short time.
77,37,> The mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
77,44,I'm the person who was thinking that this was a prank.
77,52,"I mean, I think that's the sort of thing that he would do if you got the AIDS shot, but I'm not sure whether he'd just give up and go through the motions he's taking to prevent that. He can go through his AMA with a friend. I'm not sure he would, but I'm sure there's lots of questions about whether he thinks that's what they're trying to accomplish here."
77,55,I think it's the only thing that's interesting is that it is about the ACA that has been rolled out to other countries. It's basically a joke about the ACA being repealed and addressing the AIDS problem.

77,58,I have an autoimmune disease and I have a cpr virus. It's contagious and I'm allergic to it. My parents are so immature.
77,59,Vaccines are not a health issue. The issue with the ACA is the lack of proper protection.
77,68,>We need to make sure that people are aware and aware of the consequences of not being vaccinated.

That is why I'm going to read the ACA, but don't use it to make fun of any of them. I just find it strange that the whole ACA is a joke. I'm surprised that it's a joke to people who are not aware of it. I'm surprised that they're using this."

77,37,I think the CDC's position is that the ACA is only a joke because the people in it have been outraged about it and would like to know how it is actually not a joke. It's basically a joke about being vaccinated if the government wants to do it.
77,44,The ACA is not a joke. It is not intended to prevent AIDS.
