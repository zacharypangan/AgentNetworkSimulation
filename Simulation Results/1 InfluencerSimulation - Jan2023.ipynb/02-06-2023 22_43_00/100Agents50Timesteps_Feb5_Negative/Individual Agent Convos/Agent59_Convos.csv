76,59,putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i ve ever done in my entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things

81,59,i wear my mask when i m in public lawmaker who isn t wearing his mask in public says
88,59,i m going to say this about twitchcon and masks you can hate me if the state town doesn t have an mandates you can t get mad that an event doesn t not sure if sd has any mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask
91,59,two tri county health dept board members from douglas county voted against the mask public health order and one did not vote due to affiliation to a school
92,59,how does the mask make his breath come out of the back of his head
59,7,I don't think we should be allowed to wear the mask.

59,22,I feel like that is more like a saying than a response.
59,23,OOC: I am a public health dept spokesman for the state of Georgia and we have the same laws in place to prevent people from getting the virus.
59,24,if there s not a mask on people I m going to go out and make sure i don't get a virus I'll have to wear a mask. i don't think that makes any sense in this context.
59,29,It s just a nitpick about getting vaccinated.
59,31,Is wearing a mask the same as not wearing a mask to get a virus?
59,38,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
59,41,"I agree with you, putting on a mask gives them covid there s so few oh man you should come to Georgia it s like people here think wearing a mask gives them covid there s so few oh man you should come to Georgia it s like people here think wearing a mask gives them covid there s so few"
59,42,"I mean, it doesn't make me sick but I think it does..."
59,49,"A mask, for me, gives them Covid there s so few oh man you should come to Georgia."
59,52,"OP, this is why we should re-name it''The Doctor''and 'The Doctor''."
59,53,"I'm sorry, but your comment is in response to my recent post."
59,54,I wear a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then take it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i've ever done in my entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things
59,58,"Oh man you should come to Georgia to get vaccinated, you can also wear a mask to walk through public restrooms and make a noise to make sure you are breathing through a mask"
72,59,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
76,59,It makes more sense to me to wear a mask to see a lot of people walking in a restaraunt.
77,59,The only place in the country I can do t get vaccinated is with one or two people. Unless I know one of them they are definitely infested with a virus.
81,59,"In some states, wearing a mask for work is a requirement."
88,59,Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of the virus. Please wear masks.
91,59,"'Twas a shame he wore a mask and no school in the county I live in, one of the school board members didn't participate"
92,59,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
59,7,"I was going to say the same thing, because I'm in the public health department at a local public health department."
59,14,"> OP, this is why we should re-name it''The Doctor''and 'The Doctor''."
59,16,"This is a very stupid question. I mean, it makes me sick but I think it does..."
59,21,"I feel like the best part about this is that it's kind of an insult, and you might as well get a mask because you don't like it."
59,22,I think it's the best way to stop the spread of a virus. I think it's not a good way to stop a clot from spreading to someone's body.
59,23,"The word 'Path ', when translated in the correct form, is 'Going to the hospital with you '."
59,24,> It's just a nitpick about getting vaccinated. Is wearing a mask the same as not wearing a mask to get a virus?
59,29,It's really not a nitpick. There are many more people in Georgia who are allergic to HIV than they are in the U.S.
59,31,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I feel like that is more like a saying than a response.
59,38,It's funny you think a bit too many things are considered nitpicks in that they actually equate putting on a mask to being vaccinated. Is this part of the act of taking care of the problem?
59,41,"I didn't mean to suggest that you shouldn't. I was referring to the question of whether the government is really trying to prevent the spread of a virus, but rather to the question of why it doesn't make a sense to use it?"
59,42,So you like being a doctor and you like being a doctor?
59,49,OOC: I am a public health dept spokesman for the state of Georgia and we have the same laws in place to prevent people from getting the virus.
59,52,I am a public health dept spokesman for the state of Georgia and we have the same laws in place to prevent people from getting the virus. if there s not a mask on people I m going to go out and make sure i don't get a virus I'll have to wear a mask.
59,53,"I’m a spokesman for the state of Georgia. I wear a mask to get vaccinated. I agree with you, putting on a mask gives them covid there s so few oh man you should come to Georgia."
59,54,I have an OOC about a friend of mine who has gone to a school in Georgia and he was a spokesman on a number of different aspects of the vaccine. His friend has no idea about the program.
59,58,I hate it if the word 'dumbest' is 'hmmmmm..' But i feel like that's more like a saying than a response.
72,59,"I would never wear a mask, and if I did, i'd probably be in jail for committing a crime. But even without a mask, it's not like people in my city are allowed to 'hold a conversation'."
76,59,"I like to play football, but it is more difficult to wear a mask when you're in a restaraunt - and it's also difficult for someone to wear a mask that's uncomfortable - than it is to wear a mask when you're walking a restaraunt."
77,59,"The first time I ever sat on a computer reading this I thought it said ""yes the newest strain is soooooo contagious just bc they have a mask on their hands pics don't mean they re using it"""
81,59,"""... and you wear a mask? Do you know how this has happened?"
88,59,I don't understand how you can say that.
91,59,"He voted to take a mask off. He didn't even bother to look for one, he was still very disappointed"
92,59,There isn't a symphony in the US government that stops the spread of a virus. There's more to the situation.
59,7,This is what I always heard on news headlines.
59,14,We have a very strict federal policing system that allows us to do everything we can to prevent the spread of viruses from spread.
59,16,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. I think it's the best way to stop the spread of a virus.
59,21,Well there are many people in Georgia that are allergic to HIV than in the U.S. The government has not given them the necessary support for this vaccine. They simply don't have the money to spend to help prevent the spread of the virus. There are many people who have to wear their masks in order to prevent them from spreading.
59,22,"I'm not sure if it's a nitpick, but when you take the right thing and the wrong thing, that doesn't change the fact that the government wants to help."
59,23,So OOC says that wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. I think it's the best way to stop the spread of a virus. I think it's not a good way to stop a clot from spreading to someone's body.
59,24,"No. But, you've got it in the right place."
59,29,"So if you can't say that about someone who is allergic to HIV, do you have a choice between wearing a mask or a mask? Because that's not how you want to be viewed and what you need to look for?"
59,31,"I'm in Georgia, I would not 'wear a mask'."
59,38,I'm going to have to go to the hospital with you to get vaccinated.
59,41,"They say ""the problem with being vaccinated is that it's not the most effective way to stop the spread of the virus. I think it's not a good way to stop a clot from spreading to someone's body."""
59,42,I'd like to be able to say that I love the state of Georgia and have a lot of friends from here who are allergic to HIV.
59,49,You seem to think that 'putting on a mask' is a nitpick. People in the US are accustomed to nitpicking a bunch of things that are wrong.
59,52,"As someone who has a mask on, I have a second misunderstanding: ""Oh man... It's like people here think wearing a mask gives them covid there's so few."""
59,53,"I've heard a lot about these nitpicks in the past, but I don't remember what the ""advice"" was."
59,54,"So, there's an OOC about someone who went to a public health school in Georgia and who is allergic to HIV?"
59,58,"They were referring to the US government in this video, not the US government itself."
72,59,"I don't think the government is able to prevent this nonsense from happening yet, because I just feel like people who say he can't be there for his own benefit will get hurt by it. It's just that when he says he can't wear a mask he's trying to do a very bad job because it's not what he wants to do. It's not what it says to the host."
76,59,"I hate to tell you, but I think in the end, he is a man of his word."
77,59,If I'm going to ask you that:
81,59,"[NAME] said this was a response to ""Person shit, we are going to have to put on a mask""."
88,59,">The fact that you are not a vaccinate has nothing to do with your insurance policy, the fact that you have a CDC mandate to take you to the event does not mean they have mandates in your state."
91,59,People will die and die in the US if they believe Trump is the reason why they are there
92,59,"My guess is that because you're an Australian, you didn't learn that ""Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. They're just part of the measure used by the government to stop the spread of a virus."
59,7,"My guess is that because you're an Australian, you didn't learn that ""Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I'm not sure if it's a nitpick, but when you take the right thing and the wrong thing, that doesn't change the fact that the government wants to help. So OOC says that wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
59,14,"- and ""We have a very strict federal policing system that allows us to do everything we can to prevent the spread of viruses from spreading."
59,16,You haven't heard of the American government putting on masks? There's a lot of people that aren't going to put on a mask for the reasons mentioned.
59,21,"People do that to themselves, because they are unable to prevent the spread of HIV from their neighbors in other countries."
59,22,Vaccination is NOT a nitpick. The government wants to prevent HIV transmission.
59,23,It is a nitpick. People in the US are accustomed to nitpicking a bunch of things that are wrong. You seem to think that 'putting on a mask' is a nitpick. People in the US are accustomed to nitpicking a bunch of things that are wrong.
59,24,"You think you're being stupid? Because a lot of people who are allergic to HIV don't seem to know how to put on a mask, unless the doctor has a medical opinion. And if it's not a mask, then you probably shouldn't wear a mask because you're going to get sick. But if you're not going to tell people you should, I'm going to ask them."
59,29,"It's not a nitpick that you think 'putting on a mask' is a nitpick. People have to put on masks, to avoid spreading a disease. The people in Georgia who are allergic to HIV are merely making assumptions about what they want to do - it's not a nitpick to put on a mask and not the people who are allergic to HIV. It's not a nitpick to say ""I want to stay here for the sake of being vaccinate my husband in a room at our"
59,31,"I'm allergic to HIV and the government has been bringing you a ""Violence Vaccine for all"" response."
59,38,The first person comments on the video are based on my knowledge of how the government is doing things in our country.
59,41,"What he's saying is... I don't think he can get vaccinated for HIV (because the government isn't going to fix it) but if it makes him sick, he can get vaccinated. It's only if he wants to go to the hospital and get it vaccinated. It's not like he has to wear it to protect himself and others. He can't, so it's just a way to say he can't."
59,42,"I mean, I wouldn't want to come to a hospital and get vaccinated. I'd rather have my friends stay in my home town and not wear a mask to avoid getting sick."
59,49,"It's a nitpick in a sense, but it's a bad one, especially when you consider the state is a nitpick."
59,52,I think a lot of the people here in Georgia were joking.
59,53,You guys have been getting too blatantly repressed.
59,54,"In my opinion, the guy is being nitpicky. There are a lot of misconceptions about the USA, and in general, it's easy to see why these nitpicks are so prevalent. It seems that the government isn't in a position to prevent this, but rather they're willing to take the stance that being able to do the right thing and the wrong thing isn't the right thing to do."
59,58,"The people in this sub are not allowed to vote in general, but it is their duty to choose who does not want to vote. They need to work together to improve that. If you are in the state of Georgia, it's time to stop talking to your relatives about how the government wants to help and take action to try to stop the spread of HIV."
72,59,It's an indicator of something that's been a bit bad lately.

77,59,"It's pretty easy to get flu. If you have a good plan, and you aren't a part of the government, it's not a lot of people. If the government isn't helping the problem, what can you do?"
81,59,>This is what the people of the ACA are going to do.
88,59,"> Is it possible that they were trying to cover up the problem by using an acronym, or is this something that the person in this sub are being extremely rude. Vaccines are not the right, you should not have to do it."
91,59,He is the first elected President. You are a man of your word.
92,59,The government has done little to help. I'm a very active part of the government.
59,7,"I'm a huge fan of the anti-virus movement, but this sub is not in line with how the ACA has been applied in the USA."
59,14,">Is it possible that they were trying to cover up the problem by using an acronym, or is this something that the person in this sub are being extremely rude. Vaccines are not the right, you should not have to do it."
59,16,That's a good point.
59,21,I'm actually allergic to HIV and have been allergic to it for several years now. I have never been allergic to it.
59,22,I would not want to get sick in my own home or at a hospital.
59,23,This is a joke involving the Government of Georgia (which is where OOC is from) about a fact based on a movie. They are trying to cover up the truth with a different story.
59,24,My cousin is allergic to HIV. I can't find a doctor in the US who has a doctor that can prescribe them to me. I know that's a nitpick and I know that if I'm allergic to a virus I would have to put on a mask but I can't seem to find one. It's just the fact that I can't'make sure I don't get a virus' and it's not a nitpick.
59,29,This is what the GOP is trying to make a point. They have little to do with the way things are. The Republicans are blatantly repressing.
59,31,"This sub is doing a great job of illustrating what they're trying to do in the last 5 years. There's no way you should really complain about this, you should really do something about it."
59,38,The government has done little to help. I'm a very active part of the government.
59,41,"My uncle was a vaccinatist, so I was very shocked when the government stepped in and tried to stop him from getting a vaccinated from the state."
59,42,"What about this guy? I was wondering if he knew anything about it. I'm a member of Congress, and I'm in the USA."
59,49,"I figured if the ACA went through the voters would be more interested in getting vaccinated, it would be that the people who are allergic to HIV will not be allowed to vote."
59,52,"I have no idea what the real problem is, but I’ve read a lot of interesting things about the US government. I think it’s really annoying how it takes so many people to get vaccinated. It seems like a bit of a big deal to me."
59,53,"""The first person comments on the video are based on my knowledge of how the government is doing things in our country. What he's saying is... I don't think he can get vaccinated for HIV (because the government isn't going to fix it)"
59,54,"I'm not sure what you mean by ""nitpicking"", but this was the kind of thing that the President has been trying to cover up lately."
59,58,"Are you aware of the fact that the CDC isn't funding vaccines in Georgia? What they can and can't tell you is what is happening. You aren't a member of the government so it's a little strange that a CDC official wouldn't want to support people allergic to HIV with a vaccine, so why does it matter if they're funding the vaccines for those who aren't? Those people are allergic to HIV."
72,59,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. [https://www.thessfw.com/wiki/Washington/Wash_Us_Flash_Us_Hair.jpg)(https://www.ssfw.gov/resources/Hash/Mash_Us_H.jpg)(http://www.ssfw.gov/resources/Hash/Wash/Wash/Wash_Us_Ha
76,59,"Having a phobia of it is not a bad thing. You need to have a proper face, not an insecure face."
77,59,"I'm afraid that my point is that the government doesn't care enough about the public health to act based on the facts to fix the situation, which is what this article is suggesting."
81,59,"The ""I'm a man"" movie is a really good one. It's released in 2003."
88,59,This is one of those stupid things that people don't want to see.
91,59,"If you want to be elected, you're supposed to wear a mask. And when it's off, you're supposed to take off your mask and turn yourself in."
92,59,"Despite their hunching over there, they've been the reason for so many HIV cases."
59,7,I think the article is a little misleading. The guy was trying to cover up a joke about the government.
59,14,"The first part of the article isn't titled ""Another Thing, We Can't Take Care of It""."
59,16,There are some interesting things about this sub. It's a great one.
59,21,"""I feel like the best part about this is that it's kind of an insult, and you might as well get a mask because you don't like it."""
59,22,"You know, I've never heard of that movie, and I'm not ashamed of it, but I really can't believe how bad it was. It was the only time I could actually make fun of it, and in part because it's all in the video."
59,23,I'm allergic to HIV.
59,24,"They are trying to cover it up by calling it ""I'm allergic to HIV"" (because I hate it)."
59,29,I've read a lot of interesting things about the US government. I think it’s really annoying how it takes so many people to get vaccinated. It seems like a bit of a big deal to me.
59,31,...which is why I am concerned with your privacy....the people who do not care about this are the most important in this country. They deserve to be treated like that and be treated like shit.
59,38,"> ""I'm a very active part of the government."""
59,41,I feel like we have a pretty good chance of finding a doctor to help him get vaccinated.
59,42,"I love the government, but there are things the president has been trying to cover up recently that need to be changed."
59,49,"This article is very funny and very much in response to the story of the guy who was a vaccinatist, who was allergic to the virus and now was allergic to the virus."
59,52,There is not much more to this discussion than just a simple joke. I've read some of the other comments.
59,53,"There is nothing we can do to fix the problem and we have no solution. If you go to the emergency room, it will be all over. The first couple days will be the hardest."
59,54,"If you’re allergic to a virus, this is not going to change. There are a ton of different types of illnesses that can’t be detected by people on a vaccination."
59,58,Is it really that hard to know about a person who is allergic to a virus?
72,59,It doesn't seem like the article cites anything else about the NSA or the article.
76,59,"I think the president has a problem with that. If he actually is a President, why does he want to be a president? I'm sure he has a good idea for the future."
77,59,CANNOTANSWER:
81,59,"I don't think this is a joke, it's a joke about how the government is trying to stop the spread of a virus."

91,59,"I'd say if you want to be elected, you're supposed to wear a mask. And when it's off, you're supposed to turn yourself in. I don't want you to look like a fucking jerk."
92,59,"IANAL. I'm a huge fan of people who believe in masks in Australia. And I'm pretty sure they've seen a lot of them. This is about the health care system. A person that wants to work, be forced to participate in work, etc. and then become an active member of the society, have a right to a job, not just to the government, and who should work. The only thing I really do is vote for someone who wants to work."
59,7,So your opinion has nothing to do with the ACA?
59,14,What if you're allergic to something and the NSA doesn't pay you for the vaccine?
59,16,> 'I think it’s really annoying how it takes so many people to get vaccinated.
59,21,It's like the biggest fucking joke in the history of mankind.
59,22,Why don't you try to vote for the people who don't like this? Unless it makes you seem like you're really a shitholder.
59,23,"""...which is why I am concerned with your privacy....the people who do not care about this are the most important in this country. They deserve to be treated like that and be treated like shit."""
59,24,I can't find a doctor in the US who has a medical opinion.
59,29,"I think he is saying that they should go get a doctor. I've had a few allergy shots, but they're the best."
59,31,IANAL. I'm a huge fan of people who believe in masks in Australia. And I'm pretty sure they've seen a lot of them.
59,38,"So the CIA, and the FDA, can't put on a mask to protect patients, but the NSA is going to have to try to stop him from getting the disease in the first place?"
59,41,So you got to work and voted for the president? Probably didn't actually like it at all?
59,42,"I think that the government is trying to cover up this because it is the only thing that works. Is there a difference between using a mask to prevent this and a person who doesn't wear a mask? I would say yes, and the reason this apologists are trying to hide is because the people with HIV and their allergies are more likely to not be vaccinated."
59,49,"As the CDC and the CDC have gotten to know the people who get vaccinated, and are very concerned with what they get from the virus, they are essentially denying anyone who's allergic to the disease any benefit at all."
59,52,I'm a very active part of the government. I feel like we have a pretty good chance of finding a doctor to help him get vaccinated.

59,54,"As someone who's had HIV in the past, I don't blame you. I'm allergic to HIV and have a virus and can't help myself. I'm not a doctor, so I don't know how many vaccines I could possibly have on hand."
59,58,"Well, I guess, it's a joke. It's actually a joke."

76,59,"The whole ""The President, who believes we are the best we can be when we don't wear a mask is infuriating and isn't willing to take that ""sensational "" to be offensive"" kind of thing is ridiculous."
77,59,There's no way this has anything to do with a President. We're here to keep the country safe. We can't have a dictator without the government and a President.

59,16,"In my opinion, it's a good joke. If you don't like it, if you don't like it, it's not a joke. If you don't like it, it's not a joke."
59,21,The guy is a big time fan of NPR's political system. They've seen the whole thing as a joke. Almost the entire world. They've seen a lot of them. They know what they're doing but they're not interested in that kind of thing.
59,22,"I have been a doctor for about a year. It's a shame that I could tell you that. I feel like I would never get to hear that, and I probably wouldn't, and I'd like to see it."
59,23,I've heard the CIA and FDA are trying to cover up the nitpick.
59,24,The NSA can't fuck out of the government.
59,29,">He didn't even bother to look for one, he was still very disappointed."
59,31,No wonder people here do not care about the federal government or healthcare. It's like being the only person in the world not to wear a mask to get sick and the way the US is treating the people with HIV. It's not like the government will ever want to fix what they don't want.
59,38,"Vaccines are not the right, you should not have to do it. There's no way that the government is trying to cover up this because it is the only thing that works. It's ridiculous. The president is the problem."
59,41,"The guy on the tv who made the joke was an ex-coward, so the guy couldn't actually say anything."
59,42,There is no denying that the NSA is trying to cover up this because they have gotten to know the people who get vaccinated. But it's very much a joke.
59,49,">Why don't you try to vote for the people who don't like this? Unless it makes you seem like you're really a shitholder. ""...which is why I am concerned with your privacy....the people who do not care about this are the most important in this country. They deserve to be treated like that and be treated like shit."""
59,52,"IANAL. I'm a huge fan of people who believe in masks in Australia. And I'm pretty sure they've seen a lot of them. So the CIA, and the FDA, can't put on a mask to protect patients, but the NSA is going to have to try to stop him from getting the disease in the first place. So the President, who believes we are the best we can be when we don't wear a mask is infuriating and isn't willing to take that ""sensational"" kind of thing is"
59,53,"A mask – and a few other things – are part of the CIA, FDA, FDA and CDC's treatment of people with HIV. It's very important to know that the mask is against the CDC's protocols and does not prevent them from becoming vaccinated for the disease. It is an important part of how health care is done. That's why it's so important to know that the masks are used."
59,54,There's an Australian video where the NSA is trying to get a lot of people involved. They have some information on how it works.
59,58,I was the president. If I didn't want to get vaccinated I wouldn't have that problem. I don't have to wear a mask unless I have a doctor that will.
72,59,"I'm confused, and the word I was used is ""false facts"":"
76,59,The joke is actually about how bad a man's reaction is to a guy who has a history of putting on a mask. It's not just the president. The president hasn't said anything to stop it.
77,59,"If the president doesn't put forth a plan to protect his children, there isn't any way he's going to be able to use it."
81,59,"There's a movie about the idea of wearing a mask, based off of a story I read this month about a doctor who tried to make a mask, so he said to his friends ""That isn't going to help you because you have to make the mask. Because I'm a man and I'm afraid we shouldn't if we can't get rid of it."" Then the whole “we need to start a new generation of coaches that are able to understand the consequences of what they are doing."
88,59,"> ""The actual problem is how many people wear masks, and when it happens, they die. Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of the virus. Please wear masks. I don't think there is any evidence that a TB and STI fan was vaccinated. They don't believe they could even be vaccinated. I don't believe that it has anything to do with the vaccine."
91,59,"Is this the new ""We're wearing a mask"" movie? I can read it."
92,59,"I don't really understand how you can be anti vacks or anti-virals if you have to work and vote alot, you don't need a mask."
59,7,"The NSA, citing a fake wikipedia article about it, isn't trying to change what they've seen on TV."
59,14,So... the president is the problem?
59,16,The NSA is trying to cover up this because it is the only thing that works.
59,21,Then you should be an expert. The CIA and FDA are trying to cover up a lot of the NSA's lying and trying to get people to listen. There is no evidence stating that the NSA is trying to cover up anything.
59,22,"I'd like to see a movie about it, but that will get a little in the way of the real stuff, or perhaps a movie about how a guy who wears a mask might not be able to understand what it means compared to people who are not able to understand it."
59,23,"They're not going to have any evidence to stop it, but the government needs to know. It doesn't seem like a joke and it doesn't sound like the government has any evidence to stop it, and that's how we see the movie."
59,24,The NSA fucked up the CIA by bringing in an infamous virus-related virus based on the viral ape.
59,29,I'm a huge fan of people who believe in masks in Australia.
59,31,I would not wear a mask. I'm allergic to HIV. The NSA can't fuck out of the government.
59,38,>Why don't you try to vote for the people who don't like this? Unless it makes you seem like you're really a shitholder.
59,41,I see a lot of vaccarians who like to wear masks and still feel like they need a more practical solution in order to not get sick.
59,42,"As long as you are a member of Congress, you have to be able to vote for the people who do not want to vote for the president."
59,49,People think wearing a mask is the best way to stop the spread of a virus. I don't think that's the best way to prevent the spread of the virus.
59,52,That is one of the few fucks I can really understand. I want to be a good ''sector'' as much as the people who say that.
59,53,So... the president wants to get sick with a mask to protect his kids?
59,54,It's pretty obvious that the NSA has no role in keeping people at bay when it comes to vaccination.
59,58,IANAL. I'm a huge fan of people who believe in masks. I'm a huge fan of people who believe in masks in Australia.
72,59,You are a very smart man. But you are just a part of this conspiracy. Clearly you know a lot more about this than I do. What about you?
76,59,"I don't think putting on a mask is a good idea unless you are in a situation that you can't tolerate, and I know a lot of people who do. But I do think that putting on a mask is one of the dumbest things a man's ever done."
77,59,"CANNOTANSWER: ""We're here to keep the country safe. We can't have a dictator without the government and a president."", ""I don't think the president's role in making the country look bad, and a government tries to do so."", ""Is there anything wrong with my mask?"", ""Is there anything wrong with my mask?"""
81,59,"I'm afraid my face, eh. I was wearing a mask when I was in public, and the last two times I did it. It's just a very awkward part of the conversation."
88,59,"I mean, I'm still in the vaccination and i'm a big fan of the CDC, but I don't think they actually care about it or the disease."
91,59,It's a satire.
92,59,I don't think you understand the concept of masks.
59,7,Obviously I'm not the only one.
59,14,"Well, if you're allergic to anything the NSA tries to cover up the issue."
59,16,So you're a big fan of people who believe in masks?
59,21,>We can't have a dictator without the government and a president.
59,22,"People who believe in masks have the moral courage to put on a mask - if they do, then they'll probably not have any confidence to be able to get sick, even though they are in the right."
59,23,I'm a big fan of people who wear masks in the US. I'm a big fan of people who wear them when I'm out with friends or family. I'm pretty sure they were not part of a conspiracy.
59,24,I don't think a lot of people in the US think wearing a mask makes them sick because they're allergic to HIV.
59,29,I walked into this cafe at the wrong time... I think he's just an asshole.
59,31,"It's actually a really bad idea to wear a mask to prevent the spread of HIV, and if you aren't allergic to HIV, they do not need to be in your house to use it to infect people with it."
59,38,That is the most dumb part. I don't understand the meaning of this.
59,41,I think you are confusing your point with a joke.
59,42,I think you are being misleading here.
59,49,A ''I can't fuck out of the government. I want to be a good ''sector'' as much as the people who say that.
59,52,So he's actually a huge fan of people who wear masks. I just don't think he's really into the subject unless I'm in some privileged situation where he doesn't have the courage to be in a mask.
59,53,"A friend of mine did. He thought he had seen his brother, and wanted to take him to a public hospital to get vaccinated. He had seen an ape and said it was an awful infection. He thought the ape was a good guy and the government deserved better. Then when he turned his back on him he told me he needed to go to the hospital and have a treatment with his family and the police. He was really confused by the whole NSA and the CIA thing."
59,54,I can't believe I'm not on this one.
59,58,">I don't think it's a good idea unless you are in a situation that you can't tolerate, and I know a lot of people who do."
72,59,"The government isn't in a position to make a joke. Especially when it comes to the healthcare. You know, to make a joke isn't to blatantly undermine the health care system."
76,59,He is using the article a bit too much - and the other commenters don't understand. The fact that he is using the article is ridiculous.
77,59,"This is a great way to look at the world, it's a great way to understand the world. This is a great way to look at the world, it's a great way to understand the world."
81,59,">We wear masks to fight the flu. I don't care who the title is, I think you know the issue."""
88,59,That's a terrible idea! How do you explain to me what twitchcon is about?
91,59,"I don't see how this is being discussed. The only thing that would bother me about this is it doesn't make sense for a politician to wear a mask. That being said, the only thing that bothers me about this is that people are unsure about what to say about it."
92,59,I was under the impression that this is about the healthcare system.
59,7,I think the guy is trying to make a joke.
59,14,I don't think it would make much sense for a politician to wear a mask to prevent the spread of a virus. They want to prevent the spread of HIV by infecting people with HIV. They would also need to pay for vaccinations if they would want to.
59,16,I just walked in. I think he's just an asshole.
59,21,Well the thing is you ARE being an asshole.
59,22,The article is misleading. People that don't understand the issue are either misinformed or don't understand it. The article doesn't make any sense and it's been in the news for a while.
59,23,twitchcon is about the health system
59,24,It is an interesting story about the NSA and it is part of the anti-virus measures.
59,29,>We wear masks to fight the flu.
59,31,The article says something along the lines of: You wear a mask to prevent the spread of HIV. You're allergic to HIV. The government has been bringing you a virus vaccine for all response.
59,38,The President is the problem. That's a terrible idea.
59,41,I think you're confusing your point with a joke. I think that's just a way to say I don't get sick. I don't really understand the point of this.
59,42,There is nothing about the CIA or the NSA in Georgia.
59,49,I think you're overreacting and are taking the wrong position. What a waste of time.
59,52,The OP is a public health dept spokesman for the state of Georgia. They have the same laws in place to prevent people from getting the virus.
59,53,The title is misleading as well as misleading.

59,14,This is what is going on in the USA.
59,16,There's nothing wrong with wearing a mask because it makes you sick. A mask is more effective than a blood test. You wear it because it can help you fight off a disease you don't want to get vaccinated for.

59,41,I'm going to be blunt here. Vaccines are the best way to prevent the spread of a virus. I think they're the most effective way to stop it.
59,42,It's funny that I had the same sort of reaction to an article I read where a doctor said that wearing a mask helps you get away from a cold and the government tells you to avoid putting your face in the heat and not to use it. But no one cared about the situation and they would never get vaccinated.

59,7,"It is a satire, not an ethical breach of health."
59,14,"Well, that's only a joke, I don't know what to think to that. I am not gonna lie, there is a lot going on in the US, so I wouldn't trust the media to make a whole story about the president wanting to wear a mask."
59,16,I want a satire. But this article makes the NSA look shady and uninformed. It's about the government wanting to change the healthcare system.
59,21,I can't even tell you how many people are allergic to HIV and not having vaccinated.
59,22,"Unless he is allergic to any of the virus, and you think it isn't the right thing to do, then yes."
59,23,The article doesn't say anything that the people in the fucking US are obligated to use.

59,29,"You need to talk to your senator and senators. This is an issue that is not on the table. Vaccines aren't the only option for preventative health care, so this will only be a minor issue for one president."
59,31,This is a pretty good article on the topic.
59,38,Yes. We need to bring out this adolescent...
59,41,This is all a shit story. No one else thinks it's that fucked up.
59,42,The article is actually about the Obama administration.
59,49,"I'm allergic to HIV, so I wear a mask if I'm allergic to a virus."
59,52,"Basically, what the article says is the ""adventure that would be a good idea in a governmental system"" kind of way. It's like saying the Obama Administration is putting the CIA and FDA under a roof.

59,54,I think the issue is not that the article is not about Obama's policies. It's that they have done so much to avoid going to the US. That is not an issue.
59,58,">If I was in the US, it's time to stop talking to your relatives about how the government wants to help and take action to try to stop the spread of a virus."
72,59,This is a satire of the CDC's 'hysterical and offensive' joke.
76,59,"I don't know if this has a specific meaning in the context of the post, but the general consensus is that it is a big deal and a bad thing."
77,59,I can't imagine how hard it would be for people to be diagnosed with AIDS without a mask.

59,41,The CDC doesn't seem like it's the right thing to do in the USA. They're just trying to make the Americans think that.

They have not talked about that before and their efforts to nitpick the facts don't seem to have any credibility, they have been to the US for years and people are still using it as a political tool. I'm not saying OOC is a tyrant but the CIA and FDA seem to be trying to trick people into believing that they are responsible for the problem, and they are trying to cover up the shit."

81,59,I can't believe that this was the first time that I retread the title.
88,59,It's a very different issue from the original article and you've shown some very different explanations.
91,59,"I don't think the whole thing is really that crazy. I know this guy, he's got the right idea. He's a horrible president but a very interesting guy who's just not ready to be a jerk"
92,59,I don't know what to think but this is a major and significant issue. There are a few things that a lot of people have no idea about:
59,7,"I don't think he is trying to make a joke, because he doesn't believe in health. He just wants to show people he thinks health is important and they are trying to use it as a political tool."
59,14,A shit fucking post about the CIA and FDA trying to cover up a shit joke?
59,16,I just walked in. I think he's just an asshole.
59,21,A lot of people in the US think wearing a mask makes them sick because they are allergic to HIV and not having vaccinated.
59,22,"It has to do with the fact that we do not have the same healthcare as everyone else. We have everything we need - health care, public transportation, education, and education - to be able to keep ourselves safe."
59,23,People aren't conditioned to believe they are responsible for preventing the spread of a virus.
59,24,"Is the fact that OOC has a CIA and FDA official saying something like, ""Okay, that's just a satire,"" just a nitpick?"
59,29,People who wear masks are allergic to HIV. There is a lot of overlap between the three and the actual facts.
59,31,"I know this guy, he's got the right idea. He's a horrible president, but a very interesting guy who's just not ready to be a jerk I don't know what to think but this is a major and significant issue."
59,38,"I don't think the president is the problem. I think that you're being tyrannical here, I'm just saying, it's funny."
59,41,I am actually actually a CDC member and I think people who don't know about the AIDS epidemic should know better.
59,42,"CANNOTANSWER: I love the government, but there are things the president has been trying to cover up recently that need to be changed."
59,49,"""Why don't you try to vote for the people who don't care about this? Unless it makes you seem like you're really a shitholder. "","
59,52,"People are trying to trick the government into thinking that it has the right to prevent the spread of HIV, so they don't get vaccinated."
59,53,/r/ObamaFacts is one of the major contributors to this discussion.
59,54,"They're trying to do some things that don't seem to work, but don't try to keep people from seeing it and saying that they're sick of HIV?"
59,58,"Vaccines aren't a good idea unless you are in a situation that you can't tolerate, and I know a lot of people who do. I don't think you are a tyrant."
72,59,"A doctor could get a degree and just stop the epidemic, even with a mask. That would be really rude of him to do that and to say ""I don't think that's funny."""
76,59,"'I don't think putting on a mask is a good idea unless you are in a situation that you can't tolerate, and I know a lot of people who do'"
77,59,I think the issue that makes it more difficult to treat AIDS without wearing a mask is that it can get some health complications that will make it harder for someone to treat it without using a mask.
81,59,">Wearing a mask in public ARE committing an ethical breach of health, not a medical one."
88,59,People think the CDC and the CDC are the ones who make the best use of this word. The reason why CDC doesn't bother is because it is a very old joke.
91,59,What do you think is the real problem with these people? It's about his people being the real victims. I feel like there are so many people in the US and the world around us that they don't care. And I don't think it's possible that a lot of people don't have the patience or the desire to understand this.
92,59,There isn't enough information in there for you to know what's going on with the ACA. I think it's time to put an end to this nonsense.

59,24,"Well, as long as they are doing everything it's not like this shit is a joke and no one has the right to attack it.

59,23,"This post was primarily a general reaction to the fact that '""Making people feel bad for you'"" is a big red flag. The movie is ""What's a joke"" which is about the government trying to make a joke about the ACA and not the vaccine."
59,24,Vaccines are essentially jokes.
59,29,"We're not talking about the ACA here, but we're talking about a non-partisan plan, not a troll."
59,31,I’m not sure what the article is about.
59,38,This isn't a joke. It is a joke. This is a joke. The president wants to keep a joke about the ACA. The whole thing is a joke. The ACA is not a joke. The ACA is a joke. The ACA is a joke. The ACA is not a joke. The ACA is a joke. The ACA is a joke.
59,41,The President needs to be stopped.
59,42,CANNOTANSWER is an expert on the US healthcare system.
59,49,Is it a joke? This is a joke about all of the things the president is trying to cover up.
59,52,">As a huge fan of people who believe in masks in Australia. And I'm pretty sure they've seen a lot of them. So the president, who believes we are the best we can be when we don't wear a mask"
59,53,There is a lot of untrue information about the ACA and how it is made and why the ACA is not a joke.
59,54,What's the issue with this? Are you aware that it was made by someone who was unable to afford health insurance or insurance?
59,58,The entire thing is a joke. The only reason it's not a joke is because the president is trying to cover it up.
72,59,"So if I'm in a position to make a joke and that's the point of a prank, then that's the point of the prank and the point of the movie?"
76,59,"I'm not sure if the post is true, but the article does say that it is a joke. In fact, a joke about the president isn't supposed to stop the spread of a virus. It isn't supposed to stop the spread of a virus, but it can help to prevent the spread of a virus."
77,59,"It doesn't matter what it does or how it doesn't address the problem at hand, it's just how it is."
81,59,"I think it is a joke that it's made out of a story, based off a book, and that it's made out of a joke, because it's just about the health problem in general. That is a joke."
88,59,The CDC's job is to stop people from getting vaccinated and not vaccinating them.
91,59,I don't think the movie is good. I'd say that it's a good movie.
92,59,You're a troll.
59,7,">""That's the point of the movie."""
59,14,"In the US, the government can't afford to vaccinate people. The president can't afford to take care of that."
59,16,I think this is a joke.
59,21,"Are you aware that this article is about the government, or how it's made?"
59,22,"You’re absolutely correct. The CDC needs to shut down all contact with HIV patients and the people who live there, not the government."
59,23,">I'm not a big fan of people who wear masks in the US. I'm a big fan of people who wear them when I'm out with friends or family. I'm pretty sure they were not part of a conspiracy."""
59,24,"Well if you're allergic to HIV, the only person that can do anything with that is the person who is allergic to the virus."
59,29,CANNOTANSWER is an expert on the US healthcare system. Is it a joke?
59,31,Honestly I would say that the whole thing isn't going to change any time soon. What's happening isn't happening. This isn't a joke.
59,38,I agree with the other comments but my point is that this movie was about the fact that the president is trying to cover up his own position by covering up his policies and trying to troll people.
59,41,Vaccines are the best way to stop the spread of AIDS. The ACA is the best way to prevent that. The ACA is not a joke. The ACA is not a joke. The ACA is not a joke. The ACA is a joke.
59,42,You're a fucking idiot. And not a troll.
59,49,This is the simplest explanation of why a bunch of people would vote for someone who was allergic to a virus.
59,52,"This is not a joke, this is a satire. Vaccines and STIs are not health issues."
59,53,"That's what I think the ""Film a joke"" is."
59,54,Vaccines are a joke because they protect us from the germs of viruses.
59,58,"In the end it is a joke, not a joke. The whole thing is a joke."
72,59,"Assuming that the movie complies with the basic CDC guidelines, you're also correct that a hat is dangerous, though, because it prevents anyone from getting HIV/AIDS."
76,59,It's just a joke. It's a joke that is a joke about the president.
77,59,"CANNOTANSWER : (http://www.ny.gov/hp/hp/fb/info.html#HIPAA_EASE.jpg](http://www.ny.gov/hp/hp/fb/info.html#HIPAA_EASE.jpg) 'Phoenix' explains a few things in terms of a joke: ""They have to wear a mask to prevent a disease if they can't find the right people.', ""(http://www.n"

88,59,I don't want to give the CDC any more credit than it deserves.
91,59,"Why do you feel so bad about that? I'm not so fucking sure how you can think that, but you've got to have a lot of ideas."
92,59,>I'm an expert on the US healthcare system.
59,7,"It is a joke. It is a joke. A joke, is one. If the president were a nitpicker he would have been playing a prank on a big bunch of people and being the worst person ever for what they saw in the newspaper."
59,14,I have not even seen the movie. The fact that the author of the article has a satire about it seems like a joke. The movie's description is really a piece of shit.
59,16,The whole thing is a joke. The whole thing is a joke.
59,21,"The joke is made based on the fact that there is a conspiracy to infiltrate the CDC. This is not about the ACA, it is about the CDC."
59,22,CANNOTANSWER is an expert on the US healthcare system. Is it a joke?
59,23,"The CDC wants to shut down all contact with HIV patients and the people who live there, not the government."

59,31,Is the whole thing about the ACA a joke? Is the ACA a joke? Isn't it about the health issues? Because it seems like there's a slew of hypocrisy underlying it.
59,38,I would love to listen to the podcasts of this movie. It's so incredibly interesting that I've actually heard some of the fucking CDC in a few months. It's very helpful.
59,41,"As you can see the title of this link does not seem to mean 'HIPAA' and is referring to the ACA, and I don't know if that means anything in any way other than it is a joke."

59,49,"I've read a few different versions of it, not the ones I liked. The ones I've liked are, 'They have to wear a mask to prevent a disease if they can't find the right people.' Then I'll look back and think, 'Well, if you’re allergic to both HIV and my mother’s HIV.'' Then I will look back and think, 'Well, it seems like that’s a joke. But this is a joke."
59,52,The only reason I'm uncomfortable is because my boss has a mask on and I'm not a big fan of him and the rest of the people around him hat on.
59,53,The ACA is a joke. It's a joke. A joke. I would say it's a joke. I have no problem with it. It's just a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.
59,54,CANNOTANSWER:
59,58,This sub has an AMA about a joke. The joke has little to do with the actual issue of HIV. But it does have to do with the fact that 'The whole ACA is a joke.
72,59,"You are right, it's a prank. The hat isn't a good idea. The whole idea that a hat isn't a good idea. The whole idea that a hat isn't a good idea. The whole idea that a hat isn't a good idea. The whole idea that a hat isn't a good idea."
76,59,"A mask is not meant to stop a shit hole from spreading. It's meant to stop a prank and prevent the spread of a virus. It isn't supposed to stop the spread of a virus. It's supposed to stop the spread of a virus, but it can stop it from spreading."
77,59,"It's a joke, but it's a joke."
81,59,It isn't a joke. It is a prank. It is a joke.
88,59,The CDC has a lot of stuff in common with a lot of things that people seem to dislike about it and a lot of things that don't.
91,59,"I like this satire, I'm not a fan of the movie and a lot of people think it's pretty funny."
92,59,"A lot of people have the same attitude, which is why people are so opposed to the ACA. It is a very complicated issue. It is a very complicated issue. The ACA is a big issue. It is a big issue. It is not about the US healthcare system. It isn't about the ACA."
