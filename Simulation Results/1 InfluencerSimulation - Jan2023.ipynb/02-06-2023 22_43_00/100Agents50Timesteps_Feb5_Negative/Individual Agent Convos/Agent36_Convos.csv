36,1,"It's not about the vaccines, it's about whether or not the state is required to cover their face with the necessary safety equipment. Regardless of whether the vaccine is effective, you are still liable for the consequences, and it is illegal to cover your face with a mask."
36,5,I think this is the reason people are retaliating. We don't need to be like this. I have to wear a mask to work.
36,13,I was in high school and I just assumed that it was a joke about being a vaccinator.

72,36,"No, I think the truth is that it doesn't matter what it's in public."
77,36,Are you sure you are a public figure? I'd like to ask that.
79,36,That's one of the things I noticed as well.

89,36,"In my personal life, I was a doctor and had to cut my hands off in order to stand on the inside of a restaraunt."
93,36,So you are saying that it's illegal to make your own health insurance policies? It's illegal. That's just ridiculous.

36,23,"IANAL, but he wears a mask because he loves the job. Yes, they're supposed to protect the public from the spread of a virus."
40,36,"The mask isn't the problem, it's just that people are uncomfortable and have a hard time not getting vaccinated. They also use it for protection."
58,36,"I don't see why you should be banned from a game unless your team has a mask, it's an illegal act."
66,36,"Because we need to do the proper things he did. He did it because he knows what he was doing. He is also a scumbag. He knows he can't tell you what he does or not, but he can't stop you from doing it."
68,36,I'm a law school teacher. I don't get it. The question is why do you have to wear a mask in the workplace? Do you just do it when you're not in the office? I don't see how that could be true in the obscene amount of work you do in the workplace.
72,36,"That's why a tv show that's on TV doesn't have any actual facts to back up its claims about people in the US being able to keep a public health awareness system, and that the government is helping to stop the spread of a virus."
77,36,"By the way, it was a good conversation. So I would like to think it was good."
79,36,It's a really stupid question. I am sure that you will find something better to say.
82,36,And what would you say is that the government is responsible for the removal of this mask?
86,36,There are people who are so crazy and stupid that they don't get to put on a mask they are not willing to wear any kind of protective equipment.
89,36,It's not a joke. It's a joke.
93,36,I'm interested in how this can be used to get the government to do this.

36,13,"I'm going to say that twitchcon and masks, where a guy has to wear a mask, is a joke, isn't just a joke, but a way to stop a virus, and is the best way to prevent it. I want to make a statement, but this guy is so bad he's just lying to me."

58,36,>I wear a mask but the gov't tries to prevent me from wearing the mask.
66,36,I think there's nothing inappropriate in the article.
68,36,"It's not that much of a difference between what's being done in the US, and what's being done in the US."
72,36,"I don't understand how these BS movies can be so damaging. They would be horrible if they did that to people, they'd just have to go back to their homes. Basically what they do is a good thing for them."
77,36,This isn't an article to make fun of the government. It's a conversation.
79,36,A couple years ago I was wearing a mask to work. But it never worked. It popped into my head because of a cold and slo-fi allergy.
82,36,And what would you say is that the government is responsible for the removal of this mask? That's a big problem in this country. We need to protect ourselves. It's not a solution to this problem.
86,36,I've never heard of that if the mask is a good idea.

Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks."
68,36,A lot of people want a sexist joke. A mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.Exactly what my friend said. He said the same thing about the CDC and people he was in contact with. He said it is only a joke because the CDC was not interested in helping with the epidemic and so the CDC is not in charge of preventing them from getting sick or hurt. It's kind of silly to talk about how the government is doing what's necessary to prevent the spread of a virus.
72,36,A hat doesn't just look like the person who wore it. A mask is a kind of mask. That's it. A hat is a hat. A hat has a meaning. That's what it is. It's weird.
77,36,I think you're overreacting here. The ACA is an antisemitic act. Why don't they have a problem?
79,36,I had to go through that to find some truth in it.
82,36,"CANNOTANSWER: ""In this country I am the person in the photo that wears a mask to prevent the spread of AIDS. It's only a problem if they can't get away with it."

I like it because I feel ya. I'd like to emphasize that wearing a mask"
93,36,I think it's also an interesting fact that some people aren't aware of the ACA. The whole ACA thing is a bit confusing.
101,36,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
36,1,I think the entire movie was overreacting.
36,5,I have a feeling I'm going to be more reliant on the government in this situation.
36,13,I'd say it's funny and not a joke.
36,23,Is the idea of the president being a tyrant for being a vaccinator a joke? No.
40,36,It's also a joke about his family.
58,36,"Yes, they need to get people to wear masks and get to be vaccinated. They're a big help and they really need to work with people."
66,36,">The article says it's ""just the fact that Donald J. Trump is wearing a mask, he doesn't even have the right to be a leader because he isn't in charge of it."""
68,36,AIDS is a public health issue. This is why there is a huge public health shortage.
72,36,"I'd say it's pretty funny, because it makes it seem like it's been written before, but I just don't think that if someone were doing this the government would be willing to do so."

82,36,It's the ACA that's really helping the people. It's a big problem.
86,36,"If a man put on a mask, he would be a troll. Besides, if a person does a troll face, that's a joke."

36,23,"That is absolutely ridiculous, because it's not something I could even care less about."
40,36,The CDC is not a part of the ACA.
58,36,The whole of that ACA is so awful. I would think it would have caused a lot more problems than what it already has. There's a good reason to be concerned about not following through on any of this.
66,36,"No, not a joke. Just a bit of the other stuff that makes it sound like the author is on the side of the film."
68,36,"I mean... it is a joke, and I get that the CDC isn't in charge of helping with it and smacks of a troll. You should have read this article. You should have read it."
72,36,"Then again, if I were you, I would have a good time! I do not know what kind of person I am, and I do not know who I am, so that might be a good way to get to know you."
77,36,It’s a joke.
79,36,"A lot of people here think this is a joke, but thats a lot of nonsense that makes them think it's a joke. It's not a joke. You're being rude."
82,36,That's exactly what the wikipedia article says.
86,36,"I'm not surprised he was in an attempt at an abortion. I'm not saying his mask is the joke he's invoking - or it's not because he is not a doctor, but that there are people in the military who essentially do not believe in abortions."
89,36,It's all good and interesting. It's a good thing people have hats.
93,36,Why does not the ACA require consent? Because it's illegal to make your own health insurance policies?
101,36,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
36,1,The CDC doesn't mandate vaccinating the entire population of the country. The ACA does not require consent.
36,5,"I'm an anti-vaccination activist in the military, who wears masks to prevent a lot of medical malpractice. I'm not sure what the joke is about."
36,13,"A lot of people here think this is a joke, but thats a lot of nonsense that makes them think it's a joke."
36,23,Why doesn't the ACA require consent?
40,36,"I mean that is the point of the article. Mostly I read it as if it was about the CIA and CDC, not the CDC itself."
58,36,"No, it's not a joke. It's a joke."
66,36,"The author is pointing out that Trump has never actually endorsed the ACA, and has said that it's an important one."
68,36,As an ex-med student who isn't familiar with the health care system I am a little confused because I have been in a similar position. I see this from time to time.
72,36,"It's weird and sexist. It's not a joke, it's a joke."
77,36,"It's pretty clear that he isn't talking about the issues in the book, or the ACA. It isn't that far from the truth, but it does get to the point where people are being offended."

82,36,We need to protect ourselves. It's not a solution to this problem.
86,36,"If you want to prevent a disease, you can't just use your mask to prevent it."

36,23,"This is the worst thing i've read all day, and I'm blaming a lot of it on my wife for her reaction."
40,36,I think the problem is people not being vaccinated.
58,36,It's a joke.
66,36,"I am not sure what you mean, I think the ACA should be voted down and re-enacted by the people who pushed for it, and then it was decided by the people who voted for it, and so I don't know if he'd have vetoed it or not. Isn't that the context?"
68,36,"The Obamacare Act and it's provisions are a joke, not a joke. But it's a joke to have a face mask in your hands. It's a joke because it can't help prevent the spread of a virus, the government is doing it to help the health care system. It is a joke."
72,36,"The CDC has to be more than an agent to stop the spread of an AIDS. They're only sending a few of those to Georgia, so no one's gonna get sick."
77,36,"Why don't they have a problem? Because I know that's a joke, but I think it's a good way to look at it. It's not as bad as saying, ""But you're crazy huh?"" and ""Do you think you need a political stance and a moral one?"""
79,36,"> I think it's funny that the doctor said the CIA was trying to stop the spread of a virus, but they actually thought it was a joke based on the article."
82,36,This is a big question: are those people who believe in ACA to 'protect themselves' from getting HIV?
86,36,"What do you mean by ""people with a mask who don't know how to walk""? You mean the people with no idea of how to use a mask?"
89,36,sarcasm.
93,36,If we're not talking about the ACA at all we are talking about a few people claiming to be presidents.
101,36,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
36,1,"Yes. It is illegal. It is illegal to be forced to use masks - because it hurts their health. You are not allowed to be a troll, you are not allowed to be a politician."
36,5,You should read [Which is the first post that had anything to do with a joke or an actual fact].
36,13,I can't believe this article is a joke. I'm sorry but I've always heard this phrase when I read it.
36,23,"I mean, if he's against a veto of ACA, what's he talking about? Because he has no right to change his mind. The ACA is for the people, if anyone is against a veto, I'd go with the fact that the ACA would cause harm. If he's not opposed to a veto, I'd also go with the veto that would make the veto the same as the veto of the president and then I'd give them an important job."

36,1,The CDC is trying to get rid of this stigma. Vaccination is an illegal thing.
36,5,"Vaccination is illegal. You're not going to save people, you don't. That's about the whole point of the ACA. If he's against the ACA, what's he talking about?"

36,23,I was gonna say that I have a friend who has the same sort of thing.

36,5,"The entire movie was overreacting. I'd say it's funny and not a joke. ""I don't like wearing a mask unless it is a joke about the government."""
36,13,I think it's one of the more basic parts of the joke that I would call a joke because I'm a hat guy. The jokes are not going to make it any more funny or funny. The most important part of this joke is that it's an excuse.
36,23,It was a good movie but it wasn't as good as a new ACA or the movie.
40,36,"I think you are being a dick, because I think you are a dick, because it sounds like you have some really unprofessional sense of humor."
58,36,The ACA protects people from the spread of the virus. They are not necessary for our nation to survive. They are the best way to stop the spread of HIV. The ACA prevents the spread of HIV. The government needs to do something about it.
66,36,"CANNOTANSWER is a troll. There's a lot of troll in this book, so I'm just going to put it this way."

72,36,I want to elaborate.
77,36,Isn't the ACA a joke or a joke? It's an antisemitic act.
79,36,I'm a Canadian.
82,36,The fact that it's a problem isn't what the post is saying. It's what people like to believe.
86,36,The movie PED to be like a baby without an epidural. That was a joke.

36,13,The article states that it is a joke because Donald J. Trump is wearing a mask. It is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
36,23,I can't stop thinking about the ACA being the bad guys.
40,36,It's not a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.
58,36,I don't see how it would make you think the CDC or the NSA is doing anything to prevent the spread of the virus. I think the CDC is a big dick. They're a big help and they really need to work with people.
66,36,I think the author is trying to convince you to read the book.
68,36,>The issue isn't just about the ACA. They need to make it more of an acceptable use.
72,36,I think that's what the quote was referring to.

93,36,I was reading about the Obama administration and I just got back to a different article. I also found the article on the same subreddit.

36,5,The guy in the video isn't referring to the ACA. He was talking about the ACA. It sounds like a joke to me.
36,13,The article is more a reference to the ACA. And to the actual hat.
36,23,Vaccination is illegal. The idea that the ACA is a joke has never been done.
40,36,The ACA is a prank. It is a joke. They are trying to make it seem like they don't have any power. The idea that it's a joke is just ridiculous.
58,36,This isn't a joke. It's a prank. The ACA doesn't change.
66,36,"CANNOTANSWER is the author of a book called ""Chilli's List. I just wanted to make sure. The author isn't going to change the facts because he's already been told about the ACA veto. The author is clearly in a coma with the trolls. The author is clearly in a coma with the trolls."

77,36,The movie was really interesting. The author is a real nice guy.

82,36,I'm a huge fan of people who believe in the ACA.
86,36,So you’re saying that Trump should wear a mask to prevent the spread of a virus?
89,36,I'm sure you've seen the sarcasm and found it funny.
93,36,"if you are concerned with whether or not there is any political point being made about the ACA, the ad is misleading"
101,36,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.

72,36,"It's weird that you can't say that you dislike a joke, but you're wrong."
77,36,Why does the author have to explain this?
79,36,The headline of the movie was a joke.
82,36,People are not allowed to buy a mask for medical reasons. The government is doing a pretty bad job of eliminating it.
86,36,I would like to see a movie with Obama on it.
89,36,"In the movie ""The Secret to the Conan O'Brien"" it's not exactly a prank."
93,36,The President of the United States is a tyrant who wants to remove the ACA.
101,36,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
36,1,They are using a joke to make a movie about vaccines.
36,5,It would be a horrible movie.
36,13,It's a joke. I'm sorry but I can't explain this.
36,23,The ACA isn't a joke.
40,36,"I'm not a fan of the ACA, but I believe that it's a prank. I don't see how you can say that this guy is trying to get the ACA to work, that is a prank or a joke.

58,36,"There's no problem with a prank that's actually a joke, but a prank isn't a prank. It's an excuse for someone to have an illness and spread it, not a prank. There's no reason to go back and find someone to prank."

68,36,"Yes, people are blaming the president for not knowing what's going on around them. They're just trying to make the situation worse."
72,36,I'm a big fan of the way the government is trying to stop people from getting sick. I'm just saying that they are trying to avoid being in the way of the epidemic.
77,36,Why doesn't the author just tell us the story - and then he talks about a bunch of other things?
79,36,">I've been talking about the NSA and I've never thought to tell him this, but I just wanted to make sure that I wasn't naive about the comments that I made about this."
82,36,Its the right thing to do. It's just the best thing to do for people who are sick and want to stop getting infected.
86,36,"The issue here isn't about ""a mask"", it's about ""people with a mask who don't know how to walk."""
89,36,"No, this isn't a joke, it's a prank."
93,36,"This is all based on the same basic idea of an illogical conspiracy. I think that the only thing stopping the ACA from being repealed is a massive political crisis in the US.... and I won't tell you what I don't like, and I don't think that's anything to be worried about."
101,36,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
36,1,This sounds like an incredibly good movie.
36,5,Why would people think this movie is a joke about something that's not in the mainstream media?
