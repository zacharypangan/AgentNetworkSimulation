13,1,This is one of the earliest instances of American people being portrayed as a racist in the media.
16,1,I was told that a lot of people have an issue with ACA because the Obama administration is racist.

29,1,The government has made a huge deal about this. The ACA prevents the spread of AIDS. The president isn't at fault for that. It's also a big deal that the players in the NFL are the only ones that are at fault for the president's AIDS problem. Wearing a mask helps prevent the spread of the virus. Wearing a mask helps prevent the spread of AIDS.

56,1,No doubt it's a prank. The ACA is a prank. I don't understand why people do that. I don't think you understand that's the point of this article.
70,1,"The whole prank thing isn't that funny. I don't think it's funny because I didn't read the original article. I'm only concerned with the sarcasm part. I think this isn't even about a joke. It's about a prank, the movie's about how the CDC is putting on a prank to protect children. This is why CDC does pranks about people not being able to stand to be hurt."

13,1,Because all these people need to think and act like an evil dick.
16,1,I was going to get a list of the reasons for my jokes:
25,1,I don't know how many people who think a mask is a joke are going to know about it. The author of the book has a good point but it is not a joke.
29,1,"I'm not sure what you're saying. I am just trying to point out the general concept that it doesn't matter if the president is a prick or a prick. Mostly because it's a joke that is funny, and it's part of the way we treat people. Specifically, the point is that the ACA will end if it's passed and the government doesn't take the issue into consideration."
36,1,"As I've read the headline, I know this movie is incredibly sarcastic and has an extremely interesting history."
45,1,"So you said that in this movie, the president wears a mask?"
56,1,"The fact that it is a prank, which I don't understand is what's going on."
70,1,"Why don't you just watch the movie, just read it? It's about the CDC and it's supposed to stop people from getting HIV and that's the problem."
89,1,It is a prank because it helps the government stop the spread of the virus.
93,1,The article is not a political thing. It's about the health care system. The article claims the ACA is not a political issue.
101,1,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
2,1,"You know, I've been here for over a year, and I am sick of all this. My parents' and grandparentss, who are trying to stop the spread of AIDS, all want to get vaccinated as soon as possible. I don't want to be a fool anymore for it."
13,1,"I have never heard a joke about being a doctor, but when you try to explain a joke you aren't doing it."
16,1,"Apparently the article is using the CDC's fucking agenda as an insult. But if I'm going to get a list of the reasons why my jokes were sarcastic, I'm not gonna get any of them."
25,1,"The author said that he was ""in the mood for a movie"" and said that ""if you want to get in touch with the government, make sure you have good contact with the health care system, then you should be able to have the health care system implemented."" That's one of the reasons people in the post don't even understand the meaning of this."
29,1,"Yes, I know. I'm a lawyer, a lawyer, and we had the conversation over this. So I'm going to go ahead and say the obvious things:"
36,1,They are using a joke to make a movie about vaccines.

16,1,"The people who would get a job would get a job with the CDC, and it would cause an awful lot of people to get vaccinated. That said, the president must not be wearing a mask."
25,1,I'm gonna put the movie in front of you...
29,1,Is it any secret that you are able to get a public health care?
36,1,This sounds like an incredibly good movie.
45,1,Vaccination is a key component of preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS. The act was a joke for a few people who wanted to push for it.
56,1,"The article is very interesting. One could say that it was ""as part of the measures deployed by the government"" (http://www.thenhs.gov/resources/nhs-aca/) and instead, it should have been adopted, which I agree with most of the other commenters.

93,1,"I'd say the Obamacare mandates have a great deal of support, but in the article the main issue is that you need to see a doctor."
101,1,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
2,1,This ACA is so important to America that there's nothing else to be said. Is that a joke?
13,1,"Yes. The article suggests that the US government is doing everything for national security. It's not ""helping"" with the spread of the ACA. The president needs to put his mask on first because he doesn't think people are crazy to him. So he should wear a mask and get vaccinated. It's about the pranks of the CIA and the ACA. The ACA is the only thing that was ever actually known as a prank."
16,1,"he is saying that wearing a mask to prevent the spread of the virus is a joke, not a joke"

70,1,If there are other pranks that don't make you laugh then I think you need to look for a new friend.
89,1,I think it’s more about the idea of the movie as a prank than it is about the fact that it’s actually a good movie.
93,1,"""The article is about the health care system."
101,1,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
