18,16,"It was said that they would do an ""alarm"" to prevent people from infecting their body with disease."
23,18,What is the most important part? This is a topic that you need to talk about.
31,18,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
34,18,>>See this is how crazy trump s made the united states of america if you want order in america president donald j trump must take off his mask and turn himself in oh and every day he doesn t people will die starting tonight i m a man of my word covid
35,18,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
41,18,"I would not wear a mask in public unless they want to protect themselves and everyone else is exposed to the virus. They would be a great way to protect yourself but if you don't want to, get the jab."
52,18,"The most blatant example of a ""vaccaine ban"" in the U.S. has been found to be the use of a mask that protects one person from a virus."
56,18,... so you are not against the mandates and do not wear a mask?
74,18,oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that
80,18,"The NSA, at least in New York, has a good policy of preventing the spread of infectious diseases."
86,18,"I believe he was under a mask a few weeks ago and there was no way he walked back there. It's not exactly a normal - it's just a mask, or a mask that you wear a lot when you're in a bad mood - situation - and I'm not saying that you're not wearing it in front of an audience."
92,18,How does a mask make his breath come out of the back of his head?
99,18,I love the fact that Donald J trump is wearing a mask and you are the first person to do this.
18,6,I was under the impression that if Trump wanted to get the vaccines removed he should wear a mask or get the jab. I think the gov't has something to say about that.
18,10,That's a pretty accurate statement.
18,14,"It's not that it's not a normal thing to wear in public, but it is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
18,16,It is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

It is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
23,18,We've gotta keep our heads up if we want to get vaccinated.
31,18,"It's really not just the first part. It's a second part, it's the second part."
34,18,"The most outrageous thing I can say is that you don't have to be wearing a mask to work properly, you need to be wearing the proper gear, and it's not your responsibility."
35,18,I think this is a good way to look at it.
41,18,"We gotta go to the hospital to get tested for a virus. We need to see a doctor that's familiar with the virus, but we don't know when. I want to see how it passes though if my doctors tell me how to take it on a drug test."
52,18,"I think it's very sad that someone has no way of telling if their 'face' or their face are not being taken off and that someone who wears a mask knowingly infringes on their health. In my state, they have it on the helmet. If they did, then it would be a bad idea to sign up to be in charge of Douglas County for such a small number of counties."
56,18,I'm still shocked by this. People can use a mask for any purpose.
74,18, You can breathe in the air with your face down.
80,18,"I know right. I know the fact that it seems like you're on reddit just to find out that you are a legitimate citizen in Colorado. So no, the whole state is a state."
86,18,"In other news, it isn't surprising that Trump's mask is used in the military."
92,18,You can't tell whether a mask is actually helping with the spread of a virus.
99,18,"No, you're right, I hate that one, but the other one is amazing."
18,6,Is this all a thing they do?
18,10,"I'm not in the military, but I've been in the military for over 20 years."
18,14,"I've had many friends that wore masks in public - my husband, my mother, and I, too. They were all in public. I'm a huge fan of the new technology that allows you to take your skin off while in the car alone. I don't think you have to wear a mask at all to be able to wear one - at least that's what I have."
18,16,"I am a civilian who works in the military and my helmet is a military helmet. It is one of my all-time favorites, so I don't know about the details on it."
23,18,Yes. We have a policy regarding wearing a mask. They say it prevents people from traveling and being vaccinated with a vaccine. The policy does not permit the public to drive to the university in a mask or helmet. It allows it to be worn while a public health department is going to be out of the country.
31,18,"Exactly why he said ""I wear my mask to get a virus, it makes my breath come out of my chin."""
34,18,"The point is, I am not a fan of football at all. I do not care if I get vaccines for my TB or STI's because they have no chance of me getting a vaccine."
35,18,What is the biggest misconception I've encountered in any public health situation - the lack of a health care provider who cares enough to do all of the right things without needing a mask.
41,18,"> We gotta go to the hospital to get tested for a virus. We need to see a doctor that's familiar with the virus, but we don't know when. I want to see how it passes though if my doctors tell me how to take it on a drug test. I don't know why you think putting on a mask gives you the right to be in public."
52,18,"OP, this is why we should re-name it''The Doctor''and 'The Doctor''. The Doctor wants the state to be the best state to teach his players and not give him the choice between the sexyness of a mask or a mask worn under a helmet."
56,18,It's pretty much what I thought. I'm curious as to why they are doing the ACA as part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. One of the dumbest things that I have done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things that i've done in my entire life and i'm not joking.
74,18,"Is there a way to get your husband to have a second look? Do you have a rat? If so, then I don't think you need a mask. The first is not a virus that is spread through the blood of a mosquito, but it's a virus that is infecting your throat."
80,18,"If you don't mind us mentioning it, why aren't all those kids just on the internet?"
86,18,I've been a U.S. military savior and I feel smug and smug.
92,18,The censorship measures are the best thing they have to do.
99,18,I think Trump needs to be a more serious and responsible person and he has the right to be a good leader if he wants to live the life of his dreams.
18,6,I would say that it's a matter of the people.
18,10,"I have to tell you, I don't believe it. The fact that you don't get sick by wearing a mask is a part of what made Trump invading this country, and this would be a good reason to not get sick because you're a civilian is a whole different story, and this is a stupid idea that is a mistake."
18,14,"I think he's a good guy. And if I remember correctly, he has a mask that's just a way to cover up the fact that he has a rat. And a helmet for an infectious disease."
18,16,"[In other news, it isn't surprising that Trump's mask is used in the military. They say it prevents people from traveling and being vaccinated with a vaccine. The policy does not permit the public to drive to the university in a mask or helmet. It allows it to be worn while a public health department is going to be out of the country."
23,18,"I'm not a conservative, but this is the kind of thing I would do to defend the ACA. Specifically, the use of ""we should not be in a public place"" to restrict and discourage participation in a medical situation, and it's a stupid idea."
31,18,The article seems to have gotten more and more popular recently. I'm sorry but it seems the government hasn't had a mandate on the topic.
34,18,"It was supposed to stop the spread of the virus. It was supposed to help in preventing the spread of a virus. The gun worked in the background, a floppy disk, that could be used to burn a dead person into a floppy disk. Then the person had to carry it, and the gun works the mask doesn't says the woman that wears the mask I see where you're coming from."
35,18,"When we wear a mask, we get sick from it, and that's when the problem arises."
41,18,I think I can help you out. What he said is very obtuse and reprehensible. It's not going to change as long as the ACA doesn't come into effect.
52,18,"I'm not sure if it's worth the effort to read the article, but I'd agree that the ACA would not be appropriate."
56,18,Why did this guy even read the article about the ACA?
74,18,This guy is just putting the mask on himself. He's a jerk.
80,18,"People can still go to the NFL, if they want to... the NSA is not the right one to do this."
86,18,Is the government really trying to cut the airstrips of people who are in the military?
92,18,I don't think the people who believe in masks are trying to change what they see about HIV.
99,18,I think he needs to be a more serious and responsible person and he has the right to be a good leader if he wants to live the life of his dreams.
18,6,... he's an idiot?
18,10,"As a military veteran, I am sure I would read the article."
18,14,"I'm a huge fan of the new technology that allows you to take your skin off while in the car alone. I don't think you have to wear a mask at all to be able to wear one - at least that's what I have."""
18,16,"The people who wear the mask have no right to believe what they think or do, they aren't putting themselves into a position to support someone who is wrong or doesn't."
23,18,Are you sure you think that the Obamacare would prevent people from getting vaccinated?
31,18,A lot of people who want to wear a mask say that their skin is a bit hazy. They are also using a fake mask.
34,18,"It is very true, but there is a lot of myth behind it. The fact that we have a government in place is completely unfair. It is a myth that everyone must be put on their mask to prevent the spread of a virus."
35,18,"There's no reason to wear a mask outside of work without having an inpatient ER, or if you're out of town, getting an appointment to see an intern (ie you don't have to go to the doctor or if you're on vacation), unless your doctor recommends it."
41,18,"""I have no idea why you think putting on a mask gives you the right to be in a public space. I think I can help you out. What he said is very obtuse and reprehensible. It's not going to change as long as the ACA doesn't come into effect."""
52,18,"“I’m sorry, but I’m not gonna stop wearing my mask. I’m just going to take the time to write a letter to you. I am sorry that you’ve been inconvenienced. It’s our job to be a better person. We need to move on. We’ll get better”"
56,18,"The issue is that the ACA is being passed with full effect, but OP is wrong. They are just attempting to prevent people from getting vaccinated."
74,18,Nope. This is a joke that seems to be trolled all over the web.
80,18,"Yes, it's illegal, and the NSA is sexist."
86,18,">I believe he was under a mask a few weeks ago and there was no way he walked back there. It's not exactly a normal - it's just a mask, or a mask that you wear a lot when you're in a bad mood - situation"
92,18,I would buy a hat with a mask. I'm pretty sure you're a very active part of the government.
99,18,"That's a really fucked up idea. It is also an attempt at giving the movie the message that his mask isn't the issue, which is not really what the movie is about."
18,6,It isn't the government. He was wearing his mask.
18,10,"I was in the military in the 80s and it's the biggest problem for my entire life. I've been in the military for over 20 years and this is an interesting and interesting fact about how people use and defend masks, because I think they are good ways to protect themselves."
18,14,This is what is about to be reported - the people who wear masks are actually trying to take away some of their rights.
18,16,"if you wear a mask in public, you do the same for someone who isn't in the military and doesn't have the govt, and it makes you sound jerk."
23,18,"The Obamacare was a joke, I think, it's a joke. But they're trying to cover up the truth with a new joke, because they know that a new one isn't going to happen with that much data. I like to think of it as the opposite of ""We should not be in a public place"" and ""We should not be in a public place."""
31,18,I'm sorry but it seems the government hasn't had a mandate on the topic. A lot of people who want to wear a mask say that their skin is a bit hazy. They are also using a fake mask.
34,18,">I feel like some people would just want to make this clear. I was just a student. I wasn't a troll, but I had a hard time believing that a mask was just not in the uniform that the president needed to wear. I am just being silly."","
35,18,"I'm gonna go for a lie, and just say that this is one of the most downvoted post of all time."
41,18,I'm assuming that's what I meant.
52,18,"What? Because the ''The Doctor''"" is a joke and it doesn't seem appropriate in some states. And when a person thinks that people aren't using a mask to prevent an illness, they are wrong."
56,18,"The article is very interesting. One could say that it's been around a long time that it was ""as part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."" The other would be ""The issue is that the government needs to go after their own problems and avoid them."""
74,18,"I am sick and confused, as the other comments seem to suggest."
80,18,"[Also see my comment about this]. [NAME] is saying ""No NSA, but i think they should be doing nothing."""
86,18,"Is wearing a mask for good? Nope, you're not."
92,18,"I want to tell you that the best way to prevent the spread of HIV is to get out a mask. It's the same thing as the one in New Zealand, because it's supposed to be something people use as a tool to prevent it."
99,18,I love this movie - and I like it because the movie doesn't have a story and it focuses on the first paragraph
18,6,"I'd say that wearing a mask is a good thing. It's a mask if it's not needed at all, and that's one of the best ways to protect yourself."
18,10,This is the most downvoted thing I've read in the last year.
18,14,This explains why you should not be in public for the rest of your life.
18,16,"I'm gonna say that the government is not doing anything. This isn't the ""Materials for preventing the spread of a virus"" movie, it's the ""Materials for preventing the spread of a virus"" movie. I'm gonna say that the NSA is sexist, not that the NSA is sexist, and that the ""Materials for preventing the spread of a virus."""
23,18,">We've gotta keep our heads up if we want to get vaccinated."", 'Are you sure you think that the Obamacare would prevent people from getting vaccinated?', 'Our father wore a mask for my high school team. He was a college coach, so it was his life."
31,18,>Is it just a simple matter of how many people you have and the many people who have.
34,18,It doesn't matter if the president is wearing a mask. It makes him look like a child and a terrible person. I don't have much sympathy for him personally but I think he is overreacting.
35,18,Its only a part of the ACA.
41,18,So... is the entire ACA a federal law that would make you a government agent?
52,18,"It's been said that the ACA is a joke, not a sarcastic thing, and will do it's damn good job in a democracy, not because it's a joke."
56,18,"So, basically, the guy who went to the hospital and gave the guy a mask – with him on – and that he was actually vaccinated?"
74,18,What is this about? There is no way I've seen a joke with a rat on my head that's not even a joke.
80,18,The fact that this is so true is a bit strange. I'm really glad the guy isn't even going to be elected to be a president.
86,18,"It's all about safety. If he's not wearing a mask, then he shouldn't be doing so, but it's still dangerous to a lot of people, particularly in public. If he's not wearing a mask, then that means he's not going to be doing anything at all."
92,18,"People are in the US and I've seen some interesting stuff about them here. I can say for the record, I can't remember what the author was talking about, but I could not remember the part about the mask."
99,18,It sounds to me like the movie is a way of explaining that a political party is not enough to control their people and the US needs to stand up for it.
18,6,"Its all about safety. If he's not wearing a mask, then he shouldn't be doing so. If he's not wearing a mask, then that means he's not going to be doing anything at all."

18,16,...that's what I said. It isn't. It's a sexist movie.
23,18,"I think the problem with the ACA is that it does not allow the public to have a medical situation, while in fact, the most important is that this does not allow for a medical necessity to be vaccinated."
31,18,"Yes, this is a joke."
34,18,"I'm just saying that the whole government thing is a misunderstanding. A lot of people are trolls, and people are just not in the mood for a sarcastic stance. It's not so much the CDC as the CDC and the entire community is trying to."
35,18,>You just need to get yourself the CDC and CDC's support. he doesn't know the definition of'responsibility'. I'm just stating that I don't think the ACA is a good idea.
41,18,... And the narcotics industry has already been infiltrated by narcotics companies.
52,18,>The whole idea that the person you posted is in the context of the conversation is really absurd.
56,18,He is also a tyrant.
74,18,This is how they do it.
80,18,">I like that they are trying to prevent the spread of AIDS. It's a crime for the NSA to impose a law that identifies as ""fag"" and also the government has no legitimate interest in preventing it."
86,18,"""Is wearing a mask part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus?"""
92,18,>Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I'm an expert on the US healthcare system and I can tell you this:
99,18,I don't think it's the story.
18,6,There are a lot of people who are getting confused as to what is the story. And I don't think it is.
18,10,The US is also infiltrated by drug companies in ways that I can't remember.
18,14,I've actually got to say that I'm very fond of the word'medical necessity'.
18,16,"Unless you think that the NSA is sexist, you can't say that you like it."
23,18,"The ACA is not about public health and prevents the spread of viruses. Its a prank called ""the health of our country."" There are things we can do to prevent it and it is part of the health care system."
31,18,That's why the movie is good.
34,18,CANNOTANSWER has a great piece about this. It sounds like you're on the wrong side of the issue.
35,18,"I don't think you understand that we're talking about the issue of a'short term' problem. People who don't care about AIDS and the government can't afford to go get the mask, and the CDC wants to do something to improve the patient experience."
41,18,">Is this because the health care industry is so inflexible to the fact that a doctor should be wearing a mask, and a doctor shouldn't have a problem with a mask when he doesn't want to."
52,18,"I'm pretty sure that the comments here are about the ACA is a joke, but that is not a joke."
56,18,There's a lot of sarcasm in this subreddit about the government's failure to prevent people from getting vaccinated.
74,18,"I think it's not a joke, it's a joke."
80,18,"..(https://www.wa.gov/en/laws/2014.php/laws_and_regulations_on_the_net](https://www.wa.gov/en/legals/legislations/2012.php) [Hey, this was interesting to me, and I think it's really interesting that you wrote this about the NSA and their own actions."
86,18,"[Civil] rights group, a.k.a. the National Guard, is saying that trump wore a mask to stop the spread of a virus. There are some facts arguing that he did nothing wrong - the actual person in charge of the military was a liar slammed a piece of mail and there's no reason why that was allowed in the military."
92,18,The American people are not against the ACA.
99,18,"I don't know about the other comments, but the article is quite good."
18,6,A piece about the health care system and how it works is worth reading.
18,10,People have an incredibly limited idea of what is in it.
18,14,"> I think it's a joke, it's a joke. The American people are not against the ACA."
18,16,"The NSA isn't part of the US healthcare system, they are infiltrated by drug companies."
23,18,"We can have a medical situation for you, and the government can do what we want, and you can protect people from getting vaccinated by wearing a mask. It's not a joke, it's just a joke."
31,18,"I know that the word mask has a lot of negative connotations, but the idea of wearing it for a good reason. There are a few people in this thread who aren't really interested in Vaccination, but are interested in their own."
34,18,"OP's name sounds like ""dang, I'm not a president yet"""
35,18,"The CDC has done a great job in getting the problem solved by taking away the problem. The issue is not with that, but with that lack of people wishing to work for it."
41,18,Why is the narcotics industry already infiltrated?
52,18,"I'm a lawyer and I'm not even sure that this is a joke, I'm just trying to convey what I heard in the video."
56,18,I think this is a great example of a guy who is not a good doctor and he's going to be a big help to the CDC. I'm not going to get rid of the ACA.
74,18,"I think this is a very good movie. I love the movie, but I also think that it's hilarious. It's like the movie in an American English English accent."
80,18,That's where the article says a few things that are relevant to the topic -
86,18,"People are stupid. It seems to me he has a very specific set of problems to address. There was a lot of stupidity in the Obama administration (that is, he really was crazy in terms of that)."
92,18,And the American people are all over the place.
99,18,It sounds like a satire. The author has a chance to get the author to explain their position.
18,6,Exactly what they are saying if the public needs protection against the spread of a virus
18,10,...I read the article in a foreign language. It was the whole movie that was funny and funny.
18,14,We aren't getting rid of it. This is the problem. It is not about the health care system.
18,16,"Yes, they are. If the govt is the only one who wants to stop that, it would be a big deal."
23,18,"""The ACA is not about public health and prevents the spread of viruses. Its a prank called ""the health of our country."" There are things we can do to prevent it and it is part of the health care system."
31,18,A lot of people are a bit disappointed in what the movie says. What's so amazing about it is that there is a big problem with the ACA: there isn't any way to control the spread of a virus. It makes my breath come out of my chin. It's not just that it makes my breath come out of my chin. The movie also makes me hiccups in what I read. I could see what it meant but I could also see what it meant in general
34,18,"I don't care who you are, but the president isn't going to take any responsibility for making you look horrible."
35,18,It's pretty clear from the title.
41,18,The Obama administration is not going to change or stop the ACA from affecting the entire CDC.
52,18,"You're gonna have to do it on his part. I would not mind seeing a different president on his own, and it sounds like you're going to get better."
56,18,I was in the middle of this debate a few days ago and I was really confused. Do you see any of the people in the video saying that the ACA is an evil ideology?
74,18,I see you're probably being a bit cynical but I still don't understand how this is being interpreted. I see you're probably being a bit cynical but I still don't understand how this is being interpreted.

23,18,I'm not sure what you mean. The article stated that the guy is an opportunistic dictator because it's a problem with the government's policies. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
31,18,As a fucking American who is not the same way as the President of the United States and has no idea what a mask is.
34,18,My first thought was that there is a lot of misunderstanding behind this one. That you're being sarcastic?

41,18,"They should be able to prevent people from getting AIDS by making them wear masks. Vaccination mandates are mandated by law. Vaccination mandates are not meant to be enforced by Congress, but a federal law."
52,18,"Its not funny because they are not doing anything about it. Its a joke, not sarcasm."
56,18,"I like to think that they are trying to avoid the people who can't get vaccines as well as the people who can't get vaccines for AIDS. That's why they are not taking a seriously about it. Whether or not they don't care is irrelevant, but if they actually do, they might just be dragged into it."
74,18,This is a great movie. I have heard of people who get sick from wearing a mask. I'm pretty sure he is just trying to get the government to stop the spread of a virus.
80,18,The NSA's role in protecting the public is one of the 'best measures' to keep the country safe and ensuring that people can be aware of the problem.
86,18,"There was no reason to think that he's an asshole. The entire point of the movie is that he was just joking about something else. I was an ad for a petty joke about the president's ""hence for wearing a mask"" and the guy that read the article was an idiot. I didn't see the whole thing that you did that was ridiculous. There's an episode of the movie where he says ""he wore a mask, but without an epidural. It doesn't make sense."
92,18,I think that you're describing the US and not the country.
99,18,I'm a lot more interested in this topic than most of this. I'm not a big fan of the movie and the movie has a pretty solid summary.
18,6,Yes. The President did not stop that vaccine from spreading.
18,10,"Honestly, it's not so much that he's trying to make the government stop the spread of HIV. It's that the NSA's policies on the subject aren't being enforced, because they're not allowing HIV into the public."
18,14,"I think it's because the government is trying to make it worse and isn't doing anything about it, and the government isn't doing anything about it."
18,16,You're being sarcastic? It isn't that they are not doing anything about it.
23,18,"Yes, they are a legitimate way to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS."

80,18,The NSA is using this to stop the spread of AIDS.
86,18,"The President's mask was never approved as part of the Bush Administration and they don't believe him on the part of Congress. There were several years where Obama and the president have been considered a threat to our nation's health, especially when the people wearing them weren't supposed to be on the government's side of the political spectrum, and was being targeted. Obama has said it was a serious threat and it's not really the only thing he has."
92,18,I just wanted to say that I'm an expert on the US healthcare system and I can tell you this:
99,18,i can t stand the idea that a mask that a terrorist used is an excuse to be a racist
18,6,Those are just some jargon tidbits. You are going to need to rephrase a certain portion of the title.
18,10,This isn't a joke. This is an actual truth.
18,14,The NSA is using this to stop the spread of AIDS. The CDC is not using that to prevent the spread of AIDS. Certainly a threat.
18,16,"It's pretty apprehensive, and the NSA is going against the best of the best, because it's trying to make the American health care system more efficient, and they've got to get it right."
23,18,"I'm a little embarrassed about what you're writing here. It's not a joke, but it's a prank."
31,18,It's not that easy to use a mask for a reason. The joke was just the same as any other joke of the same kind.
34,18,"That doesn't really make sense. A large group of trolls that they don't understand are a huge prick, and I believe one of the people who voted against them being elected for this is a white supremacist, and they don't understand why they can't be deemed a troll because they know that the truth about the president is just a joke."

34,18,"There is one particular part of this that's going on that is ""Making a mask is such a stupid thing. I think this is one of the reasons it's going to be controversial."
35,18,The ACA was a failure. It's a failure. It has no business being a joke.
41,18,He was making a joke.
52,18,I was talking to a troll and said that the ACA isn't appropriate in some states. The article you responded to is about the ACA. The problem isn't the ACA. The problem is that the government isn't able to communicate effectively. It's what the government is supposed to do.
56,18,I think the point of this post is that it sounds like some kind of ridiculous joke to me. People can use a mask for any purpose. People can use a mask for any purpose.
74,18,"I am not saying that the movie is funny, but it sounds very satirical. I am just saying that he isn't going to be going to a medical class on Tuesday night. Do you have any medical advice on the subject?"
80,18,"I've just learned the phrase ""The President is a fantastic athlete and an amazing player. He should put on a mask and play football."
86,18,And the fact that this guy is a dick. The movie is the exact same thing as the one that says he's a dick. You don't even know the context.
92,18,You seem to think the most important thing to us as a society is to avoid a disease where it causes you to not be comfortable enough to exercise physical exertion. It's a horrible idea to say a good idea without even being aware of the situation. But it's a great idea to take the message out of the article.
99,18,My friend asked me to check it out for free. This movie makes me happy. I thought it was really funny but there was no satire about this. I didn't know what it was about.
18,6,"People use a mask to protect themselves. There are times when they get sick, they take a mask to protect themselves. A gov't employee gets sick and makes the insurance company pay for the service and doesn't get sick, a coworker gets sick."

31,18,>Is it just a simple matter of how many people you have and the many people who have.'
34,18,... which is why the movie I was watching was so great.
35,18,I think there are very few ways to make the ACA a joke. The CDC is working in concert with doctors to make them safer and that is not a joke.
41,18,Is the ACA an act of government? Isn't it.
52,18,he blew a joke!
56,18,"So, basically, the guy who went to the hospital and gave the guy a mask – with him on – and that he was actually vaccinated?"
74,18,"Yes, it's an article about the government and how it's handled, and that's what it says. If you haven't already. You can see how that's getting a lot of attention from some of the shit out there."
80,18,"I mean, if you're trying to get a piece of information, it doesn't mean you're being an asshole. This isn't about sexism, it's about a law. They don't care about the rule."

92,18,We want to make sure the people who use this as an instrument of treatment or to prevent their children from being infected to be able to get some help or help. And it's something we can all be more concerned about.

18,6,[We are a government. We are our own government. We are our own government. We have to work together to get this country to work together.

18,16,This is what I get for thinking that the US health care system needs to improve to help everyone.
23,18,"The jokes are in the context of health care policy, not people's health, but the context of the whole thing."
31,18,"I think there is a lot of disagreement and disagreement on both sides. The first point in the movie is that people aren't necessarily interested in AIDS, but they are interested in CDC and CDC."
34,18,"It's also a 'no'. There is no reason you don't like a guy wearing a mask to stop a virulent disease from spreading. It's a symptom of what is essentially HIV, which is a symptom of a virulent disease."
35,18,"There's a lot of good ways to make it a joke, it's kinda the opposite of what the article is saying."
41,18,The whole ACA was a joke.
52,18,"I think you need to take some time to read the article, so that you can fully comprehend that the president is doing the right thing and a better job than his previous administration."
56,18,The only reason they a prank would make people not aware of the virus is if the government had a mandate to not put on a mask.
74,18,This is a very good example of how the Obama administration has dealt with the healthcare system. That was a good movie. I liked the book and it's a great example of how the Obama administration has dealt with the healthcare system.

31,18,"i think that people should be able to choose which sex is good for them if they are not allergic to AIDS - but there are other problems to deal with that is the ACA. It's not funny at all - he's telling a story, the ACA isn't a joke, it's a joke - he's trying to make a joke, and if it's a joke, then there's no sense in him avoiding any of this."
34,18,You haven't seen The Last of Us? What's the sarcastic stance?
35,18,"No, it isn't a joke. It's a joke. You're being an asshole, and people are just getting into a shit and not getting the message."
41,18,I feel like I’ve made an attempt to put a snide joke into the ACA and the president has done the right thing to do.
52,18,"In a different country, the ACA was passed last year to a state that'said'not a joke. Hence the nickname ""the mask""."
56,18,I read the article. I see the hive mind as a very powerful force in government.
74,18,It is not a joke. It is a joke. It is the premise of a joke.
80,18,I'm going to go back to read the post.
86,18,"It's all about safety. If a man is wearing a mask because of the health risk, why is he doing it? Because he is wearing it? Because he is wearing a mask to protect himself, is the reason he isn't. And what makes this the top comment?"

""The one that says, ""[I've been in the military for over 20 years and this is an interesting and interesting fact about how people use and defend masks, because I think they are good ways to protect themselves.""?"
18,14,I don't know what a good example of that would be. That's how I think a sarcastic joke is written.
18,16,> Is there a joke about not using the military helmet as a mask?
23,18,The article was misleading and not true.
31,18,"I'm not a huge fan of people's opinions on sexist humor, but I'm interested in some examples."
34,18,"I was actually just watching the video of a video of the president wearing the mask to stop the spread of the virus. I was like ""What a cdc? I just thought it was an opportunist thing to tell you..."" Then my brother found out that it was a joke and they stopped putting it in the video. He said he thought the video was a joke and decided to try and make it work without making it to the video. He realized that he was a racist, opportunist thing. I know the cdc"
35,18,"You sound like an asshole, and people are just getting into a shit and not getting the message."
41,18,I want to see how it passes though if my doctors tell me how to take it on a drug test.
52,18,"This is an interesting topic. We're trying to work around an old myth, and it's really hard to do, but I'm pretty sure it isn't a joke. It's just a kind of troll, if not funny."
56,18,"This is not really a prank or a joke. It’s a joke. The article makes the distinction between ""you're the guy who thinks he's a dick and a sneeze and a jab.

74,18,Is the movie satirical or not? Because I think it is.
80,18,"It's been awhile, but there seems to be a little misunderstanding going on here. That the President is being very anti-virus and anti-HIV, and not faking it, or what he's doing is actually actually sexist.

18,10,"I'm a veteran who has been in the military for 20 years. I believe that in order to prevent the spread of AIDS that people are required to wear a mask. However, I also don't believe that if you wear a mask to protect yourself you're being forced to wear a mask. What the article says is that the military doesn't protect your health at all. It was all about safety."
18,14,The NSA isn't trying to stop the spread of AIDS. The CDC isn't using that to stop that. This is not about the ACA. The ACA is not about the ACA. This is about the AIDS epidemic.
18,16,If the NSA isn't doing anything then it's a joke.
23,18,This is a joke. It is a joke. It's an aphorism. It's a joke. It's a joke. But it's a prank.
31,18,"I'm a big fan of CDC propaganda, but I like how you said: ""I think it's a prank. You gotta wear a mask to fight the flu, you gotta wear a mask to fight the AIDS. What the heck? Vaccination is one of the most effective ways to stop the spread of a virus."""

80,18,I don't think it's really a bad idea to wear a mask in public.
86,18,Getting off the mask is not a joke. You didn't even notice he was wearing it a few weeks ago?
92,18,A lot of people have no idea what the ACA is about. It seems like they're trying to avoid the ACA as well as it's supporters.
99,18,"You like to read about a terrorist who uses the mask to get out of an airplane? You don't. This movie doesn't have any relevant links, just very general discussion."
18,6,I haven't seen the whole article - what the guy said is just that he's actually a fan of Trump's administration.
18,10,"I thought it was a funny thing for people to tell you that when I wore a mask outside in my car alone (I can't remember what the number is), I was really impressed with the movie itself. But I guess it's not all about the health of people."
18,14,I'm not trying to be cynical.
18,16,There are several stories of someone who wears a military helmet when the CIA is infiltrating the US health system. The US has a huge problem with it. It's difficult to convince the CIA to put an effective prevention of disease.
23,18,It's a prank.
31,18,"""I read a piece on a new episode of Glance and the Cure' where the guy has a different side of the story. It sounds like the CDC and CDC were really talking about a sick kid and the ACA was just a joke."
34,18,"No, the fact that he is a troll makes him look like a terrible person."
35,18,We've tried to get to a point where we aren't having a good time being vaccinated and it's a joke. But it's a joke.
41,18,I think you're in the right. You're the one who got a few laughs and is making a joke in the process.
52,18,What's the name of this new article?
56,18,"If you're really upset with that, you have a right to believe that the ACA is an evil ideology and it's not that far off. The problem is that it's not that good to tell people that the government has a good reason to do this and that they do not care about it. They're the reason it's being passed with full effect."
74,18,I’m not even sure what you mean. You’re an idiot. I’m just being a bit cynical. You’re saying “it’s a joke.... But what about the government” and it’s been abused. That’s the joke. I don’t know what the fuck this is.
80,18,"No, the president is being sexist. He should make a joke about the ""Sexism Act"" and the ""Sexism Act"" as ""policies, regulations, and policies."" No, you're not blaming him for being sexist."
86,18,I've never seen the movie and I'm not sure whether or not the premise is that he is an asshole.

18,6,"I'm not saying that the movie reflects on the government's policies. The movie is about the ACA, and this is the president who should have been in charge of the ACA."
18,10,"It's a little weird to think that these movies are so big and interesting, it seems as if the NSA is in the White House for a good chunk of their budget. This kind of thing has no measurable effect on the public health."
18,14,I’m glad Trump’s administration doesn’t get rid of the ACA. I think it’s a joke.
18,16,"It’s really surprising that he was trying to get this shit to the fuck out of the govt to use it, and he doesn’t like it."
23,18,[NAME] has been a member of r/obamacare (the same company that had it at the time and had no mandates to allow you to wear a mask while a public health department is going to be out of the country). The article stated that the guy is an opportunistic dictator because it's a problem with the government's policies. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of a virus.

23,18,I don't like the movie.
31,18,">I liked the movie and the movie, but I don't like the movie."
34,18,"The CDC's stance to wear a mask is based on the government in the sense of preventing the spread of HIV, and it is not based on the truth of the situation."
35,18,I think I'm going to make a statement on this...
41,18,I do not like the ACA but I want to know what he meant by a fucking joke that goes back to the original article.
52,18,It seems that the new article focuses on the ACA and not the ACA itself.
56,18,"I know people who love the movies because they are funny, but if you're a dick and do you think your right to feel like a dick for not wearing a mask then yes, you're a prick."
74,18,"[Berkeley) - The people who think ""A hat is not a joke."""
80,18,"I think the joke is that ""i don't think it's a good idea to let someone go outside and play video games on the NSA's website"" is the same thing as ""No NSA, but i think they should be doing nothing."""
86,18,That is just the first thing i thought of when i read that.
92,18,"I can't believe that the ACA and what it was about seem to be exactly the same as the ACA in Europe, and the ACA is a pretty confusing shit. But I can tell you that the ACA is not a good idea and the government is trying to kill it, not helping it."
99,18,What's more interesting is that the author isn't sure whether or not it's really the main point of the book. It's about a terrorist who's going to be murdered and then put on his mask to try to save lives.
18,6,...and the movie is a pretty good example of how the Obama administration has dealt with the healthcare system.
18,10,This isn't a joke.
18,14,> I'm not just an expert on the US healthcare system
18,16,"CANNOTANSWER: In order to do something that prevents disease, you need to be wearing a military helmet. That's the NSA's job, y'know? That's the NSA's job."
23,18,I just read a lot about it... and some comments:
31,18,"""Is it just a matter of how many people you have and the many people who have.'"
34,18,"I think people are trying to justify their statements, but not actually make a point. A lot of people are actually thinking that a mask is more than just a joke, but a prank."
35,18,The article sounds like a good joke. What's a joke?
41,18,"I mean, I was very close to this type of person, but it seems like a lot of the people in this sub are..."
52,18,"A lot of people in the US are referring to the Obama administration as the ""daddy,"" not the President."
56,18,"The article is pretty good, but the one that is being written is a lot older than the one that was published."
74,18,It is a prank about the government. It is based on a book by the Obama administration.
80,18,I haven't read it because of the post. What about the NSA?
86,18,"A prank is a joke that doesn't exist and isn't about pranks, but a joke."
92,18,"We're talking about the American healthcare system and not the USA, which are very similar to Australia."
99,18,The book is pretty good. And it doesn't contain anything that seems offensive.
18,6,"I'm very interested in the subject. This article isn't about the president, it's about the healthcare system."
18,10,"I'm sure this guy is very happy to get the right people to help him, but he's not the only one who would be upset if he tried to use a mask on a victim. I've heard this one already, and it's pretty funny. I hope he gets to know that people with AIDS might be okay with this."
18,14,"""I think it's a joke, it's a joke. It's just a joke."""
18,16,"CANNOTANSWER: In order to do something that prevents disease, you need to be wearing a military helmet. That's the NSA's job, y'know? That's the NSA's job."
23,18,"It's one of the more cliche things I've heard about the ACA, but I'm not sure what it's about. This is an article prank."
31,18,"I think if he would have asked his wife and/or a lawyer if he didn't have any experience with AIDS, then he'd tell the FBI he didn't want to be with anyone whose children are sick."
34,18,It's a joke and a joke because a lot of people like it. Apparently the CDC is just trying to make the president look worse.
35,18,"You sound like an asshole, and people are just getting into a shit and not getting the message."
41,18,"OP, here are three pranks you probably didn't hear."
52,18,What does the title of the article say about the president?
56,18,This is a prank.
74,18,"I'm a fan of ""The One Man Show"" and I've seen it many times."
80,18,This guy is not the one to troll the president.
86,18,So the movie is about the President wearing the mask and trying to stop the spread of the AIDS epidemic.
92,18,CANNOTANSWER is an expert on the US healthcare system.
99,18,"If you like the idea of the book, you should check it out."
18,6,I think that's a joke. That's what the article was trying to convey.
18,10,It sounds like you're referring to a joke of the NSA.
18,14,"The book ""A prank is a joke that doesn't exist and isn't about pranks, but a joke."""
18,16,">I'm gonna say that the NSA is sexist, not that the NSA is sexist, and that the material for preventing the spread of a virus.'',"
23,18,"I'm not going to lie, I'm trying to defend the ACA."
31,18,I thought that the movie was just a prank about someone else's story.
34,18,"The idea of the government trying to make a joke seems odd to me. A government in place that is supposed to make a joke is sarcastic, and I feel like you're being a troll."
35,18,CANNOTANSWER: This is a joke that has been downvoted to hell.
41,18,I can't imagine what the government would do if this became law. A prank is about people who are stupid enough to think the government should try and stop the ACA from taking away their health benefits or improving their lives for the people in need.
52,18,"I don't really know how he can say that to you, but I feel like the comments in this article are very, very inaccurate. I just feel that it is a joke, but it is a little bit snarky and insensitive of you to say it in such a way that you are just implying it doesn't matter whether the article was written by someone else."
56,18,"The guy who wrote this is an idiot. And that's where the problem lies. It's very funny to me, I'm not surprised, because I have done a lot of stupid things and cant even remember what the article was about."
74,18,">The first is not a virus that is spread through the blood of a mosquito,"
80,18,"a good deal of people think this is a joke, or a joke that doesn't make sense."
86,18,"There are many different things that fall under the phrase ""prankster. I don't think this is a prank, it is a joke."""
92,18,My favorite was this. That was the first time I was able to see this article and not to even think about it.
99,18,>I love the premise that Donald J. Trump is wearing a mask
18,6,I would try rephrase the title because I think it sounds like the guy was referencing the NSA.
18,10,CANNOTANSWER: I'm not an expert on the US healthcare system.
18,14,I'm not saying that the movie isn't a joke. But I think that it's a joke.

35,18,Vaccines are not the best way to prevent the spread of a virus. They are not the most important one in a vaccine.
41,18,"I’m sure you have an opinion on the ACA but it’s not about protecting people. It’s about protecting people. I’m not going to say this with any authority at this point, but to me it’s about protecting people. The government is just trying to be a liar, and I do believe it will change. It should not be about anyone who isn’t even a lawyer."
52,18,"I would like to point out that this is all over the news, especially on CNN."
56,18,"I'm not surprised at all because I didn't read the whole article and it was just an omission of the word ""prank"" in terms of the jokes. It's almost as if some guy just went on a joke about it, or at least pranked at it, because it's a prank and just a joke."
74,18,I think this is going to be a fun way to put it.
80,18,i'm against vacks mandates cuz they ruin the economy get people fired and people should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force. i feel like the guy is on a much different wavelength than the white house and is probably going to be able to see him on his first game. His entire career in this context is almost certainly an example of the problem.

23,18,"The joke is being made in a prank. If I were a doctor I'd tell you that the government isn't helping with the virus. That would be my first step. I'm not going to pretend I can, but that's where you get the real point of the joke."

41,18,The government is not working on anything.
52,18,I can't speak for everyone. But you guys need to elucidate the real problem - what is the ACA? What is the definition of a joke?
56,18,A lot of people are saying that the ACA is an evil ideology.
74,18,That's a prank.
80,18,"As you can see from the title, the whole ""socks"" thing is probably an excuse to stop the NSA from doing what they're doing."
86,18,"People are making fun of the government and their propaganda machine. They don't care how the government does it, they care about the lives of others. The government needs to slap their face on the streets, tell the media and their media what the fuck they're doing.

18,14,I don't know why you're being cynical. I do think OP is making a joke because he thinks it's a joke.
18,16,The joke isn't really about the ACA. It's about the CDC and the CDC that are trying to convince the govt not to act. They are trying to work for the people who have the highest remuneration for vaccinating people with the vaccines.

18,14,Because the joke is about the health care system and how it's a joke. A prank is a joke.
18,16,"I'm a little bit of a joker in that I don't really care. My husband and I are both in the military, and the reason we both wear military helmets is because they can help prevent the spread of infections and get people to travel to medical care. The doctors and nurses who are in the military just do their job with a mask or they get an vaccination when they are sick. The CDC is using a military helmet to prevent a lot of that. It's a joke and if you think it's a joke and a joke"
23,18,"I mean, I didn't read the article a lot but read the book and was confused, because it wasn't about the ACA - it was a joke about the ACA."

52,18,"There is a big issue with all the shit that comes out of the ACA, you might have heard of it somewhere."
56,18,I don't understand why you would want to say that it's a joke.
74,18,I think it's about the government. And the hats.
80,18,>The president is being a troll - he's not a troll.
86,18,the movie is actually about the president's mask. The movie is about the president wearing the mask to stop the spread of AIDS.
92,18,I know. i've read about the ACA before. I'm not really sure if it was anything like the ACA but I can tell you that the idea of using the internet is a pretty trolly thing to say.
