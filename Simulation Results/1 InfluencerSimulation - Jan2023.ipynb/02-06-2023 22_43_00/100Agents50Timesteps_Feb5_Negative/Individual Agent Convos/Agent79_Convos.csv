79,38,This is very disturbing. It is not a crime. There is a threat of disease spreading around the world. It is a threat to the environment and to the national health system.
79,42,the truth is that wearing a mask makes people breathe out of their heads
79,54,Its really annoying that a man can be as good as a woman.
79,55,'how does the mask make his breath come out of the back of his head' [NAME] wearing a mask helps to stop the spread of a virus
79,57,What’s the difference between wearing a mask and a mask that gets worn when the government tries to help stop the spread of a virus?
79,69,"We need more people like Trump, so people don't take on the role of the president and i mean even if it is not possible to prevent any new violence. I really like how they try to help people stop this happening."

86,79,"I can relate to this a bit. I was born in the United States and have been in many different states and I grew up in Canada as well. Now I see how this situation is different for each individual state, and I guess it would be difficult for any other state to make it. Then again, I just go to school and there is no one else here who can compare."
79,17,I am not sure if this is a movie or not. Definitely not a movie.
79,20,The whole thing seems to go into great detail with the government not doing anything to stop it.
79,36,That's one of the things I noticed as well.
79,38,How can he be as good as a woman? He has to wear a mask to get rid of it.
79,42,Do you think a guy can be as good as a woman?
79,54,"A friend and I live in New York, he had a mask and he thought it would be cool to wear. He's an excellent cook, but is not a nice person."
79,55,I think a lot of people in this sub are just thinking the exact same thing.
79,57,You said a lot about politics here.
79,69,"It's a little weird. It's very interesting to hear about a guy who doesn't have his mask on when it is necessary and he's wearing it when he's in public, but who doesn't want to be treated like a moron. That's how I feel."
81,79,"I mean, it might be a weird tidbit but it seems like we are doing the same thing with this one."
86,79,"When Obama was announced as president he was a shady asshole who walked 10 feet in the restaraunt. Now, if the President didn't take off the mask, he would be a murderer and he would be shot."
79,17,"It is a movie because it's one of the most cliche stories we have. We're making it up for the fads and the lies, but it's just a funny story."
79,20,"No, the whole story is kind of strange. What does that say about me? Are there any signs that the mask is an excuse to stop the spread of a virus?"
79,36,It's a really stupid question. I am sure that you will find something better to say.
79,38,I'm assuming this quote is related to a specific article that is a bit similar to the one here:
79,42,"""Why do you think a man can be as good as a woman?"""
79,54,That is exactly how it is with a man who does this. It's actually really cool. It just sucks when you're being called a liar and then you get some of this weird talk of a politician who can't even afford to wear a mask.

79,38,"I'm a student of foreign languages. I learned that when my grandmother first left, I used to be a snob at college a few years ago. I spent years in schools in India, where she did not have a permit. She went to school in an isolated town where she wore a mask all the time. I went to a large university in China and went to school with her mother."
79,42,How do you think a guy can be as good as a woman?
79,54,"I'd argue that this isn't a joke, but a remark about the government allowing it a few months before it goes into effect."
79,55,"Yes, the mask will be used in the public. But the truth is that it was invented in the 80s. That said, the real reason this is a movie is because it was an incredibly popular movie."
79,57,No one likes Trump so that's why they don't wear his mask when he's in public. I think it's funny how the president didn't want to be shot.
79,69,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
81,79,"... The problem is that, while the NSA is pretty scary, it's still a very different thing than what we've been given as an alternative. The government can make a government figure who isn't a government figure."
86,79,IANAL. This is a very common comment on this sub.

79,20,Is it safe to assume that there aren't some signs that the mask is an excuse to stop the spread of a virus? I think it's pretty common.
79,36,I have a few comments about it:
79,38,"Yes, the mask will be used in the public. But the truth is that it was invented in the 80s."
79,42,You're not a racist or anything. This is a joke.
79,54,The government narcissists will never put up with any such a joke. But they'll always get a laugh out of it when they're not wearing the mask.
79,55,"There is nothing a tv show can do about it, so they just talk about the issue. I just don't see it being funny."
79,57,>How do you think a guy can be as good as a woman?
79,69,"It's also pretty ridiculous that it's allowed to be worn a few months before it goes into effect. It makes it sound like a very stupid statement - it's really absurd, but very ridiculous."
81,79,I can't understand how any of this would be interpreted.
86,79,"I've been in my 40's, and we do the same thing every day. But we never wear masks. There are dozens of other ways to get people off their mask."
79,17,"That's the entire point of the NSA, and its actions, and its policies and policy is not that the government tries to stop any violence, but rather to try to stop it."
79,20,I've seen a lot of it on social media and it is amazing.
79,36,"It's not a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's not funny, it's just an excuse for people to wear their masks in order to stop the spread of a virus."
79,38,Unless it is a film and the film maker was involved then this would be too much work to have been used in any context.
79,42,"There are lots of other things that are pretty similar. I mean, if you are into a fucking war, and the government is getting out of control, it is a pretty big problem. It could be a lot worse. It might even be a very good thing to have a more progressive version of the military."
79,54,It's hilarious how we're talking about a politician wearing a mask to stop the spread of a virus.
79,55,"'I can't understand how any of this would be interpreted. I've been in my 40's, and we do the same thing every day. But we never wear masks.

81,79,"I'd have to say, that I don't see it as a joke. But I can understand where a doctor is coming from. I'd have to be able to see his mask on, for the sake of anonymity."

79,20,"There's no way I could put this in context because it's too simple, I mean."
79,36,What is the NSA's role in keeping the public safe in regards to a viral infection?

81,79,"I'm not saying it's a joke, it's just that wearing a mask helps to help in a nutshell. It's still a sexist joke, and it seems a lot like you're pointing out that the whole issue is not a joke, but a joke."
86,79,"I am a big proponent of the ""Answer, that's not a sarcastic word"" joke. It's just a ridiculous statement that would fit right in with other people's views."
79,17,"I would not like to be in any position to make a sexist joke. I'd like to be the first to rant about this and then say it's not a joke. I'm gonna make a big deal out of it, but I'm not going to give a shit if it's a joke. If it is, it's going to be a real joke and just a joke to a joke, and you don't want to see it as a joke.

79,38,>I'm assuming this quote is related to a specific article that is a bit similar to the one here:
79,42,I was able to find an article on a news network on a recent project by a woman at a church in a university of Texas.
79,54,"I don't think you understand what it's about. I'm not sure how someone would have a nutshell about this, but it sounds like a sexist joke."
79,55,The joke was actually just trying to portray the truth of the topic.
79,57,"I like how he's saying this, but I don't think he's telling the joke about wearing a mask to stop the spread of a virus."
79,69,Isn't this a joke?
81,79,"I think it would be funny to just say the first three sentences are all part of a sexist joke, but if you mean it as something we all know is a joke, that's fine."
86,79,It's an issue with all of us. You're not a troll. It's about something we should be talking about and we shouldn't be talking about.
79,17,"What is a joke? I'm not sure that's what it is, or how to think of it as."
79,20,What about the fact that Trump's mask is part of the measures deployed by the NSA to stop the spread of a virus?
79,36,"I've been talking about the NSA and I've never thought to tell him this, but I just wanted to make sure that I wasn't naive about the comments that I made about this."
