    "The NSA and NSA have done a lot of things to make their actions as a business, but they didn't do anything for the whole community. The NSA is a very large, very organized organization that wants to take care of its citizens and take care of those they have to do that, in spite of how many good people they are. It's an important, well-written statement, that the media, academia, and government agencies have to be responsible for the behavior that causes it.",
    "I'm not going to disagree with you. The ACA seems like a perfect fit, I feel like you're just describing how they look in a few of the other movies.",
    "I can relate to this but I really feel that a prank that made people laugh was just a joke and it's more a joke than a prank. I do like the jingle, but the fact that it's so good doesn't mean it's a joke. I don't know what other comments have to do with the ACA, but it's funny and the jingle is what I like the most. I would definitely suggest RA see it.",
    "I would definitely suggest RA see it....I don't know whether to support the repeal of health care or not, but to say that you believe the president is an opportunistic dictator is the wrong stance.",

    "I'm sure the comments here are correct if they're not referring to the ACA or not. I'm not pointing out the point of the post, but it's important that people understand the ACA and the healthcare system, not just the NSA, who is responsible for health care.",

    "I don't like the joke either, but I don't think you would think of the reversal as a joke or a prank. Rather, the pranks on RA are a prank. Those things are the jokes and the jingles that make it a good joke. It's a prank. The reversal is a joke because it's meant to address the problem of AIDS.",
