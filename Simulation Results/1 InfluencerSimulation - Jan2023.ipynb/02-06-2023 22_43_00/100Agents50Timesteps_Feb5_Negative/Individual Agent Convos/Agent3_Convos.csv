64,3,"I believe the reversible disease rebunks as much as the medical mask - because I don't even know what it means. There are many forms of reversible illness that you might encounter with the vaccine or other drugs you might have to use that might not be possible with a medical mask, and if you've been in the hospital for some time then that's it. You might also need to get tested and the government will be there to help you."

87,3,"I've been in a similar situation when I tried to pull a mask off, but not a mask. The only time I could pull that off was at a fast food joint. I could not use it while at the supermarket. I would go to the supermarket and get a frank. No matter how hard I tried I wouldn't have a problem."

I'll be sure to put a helmet on at the top of my head."

62,3,"I can't explain why I don't wear a mask, I can explain why I don't go to con's, but a good portion of the population does not want to. They just want to say something like, ""Is it a joke?"". Honestly I have no idea why. If you have to voluntarily come and talk to me, and I want to tell you what I did and what I did to stop the spread of the virus, I'm not sure why you're being insulted."""

72,3,"... and the US government wants it in the future, which is actually the US and isn't. So we should definitely stop doing it, if you are going to be in a safe situation, go to the CDC. They are very likely to put a massive ban on using masks and in the future they will have a big job"

14,3,"My wife went to school with someone in a mask that did not allow people to be in it as a condition of employment.

72,3,It's one of the only things that actually bothers me about being in a position to avoid the spread of SARS. It's an issue of public health. And I'm glad this is not one of those things.
87,3,The point is that the joke doesn't make sense. It's just part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
89,3,"You are right. I'm not saying the people who are talking about that are bad jokes, just that they are. I'm just saying that it's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
97,3,OP's comment was actually a joke. He had a valid point that he said a lot of things about the helmets not working in the NFL.
99,3,So a person who is a liberal can have a discussion of Donald J. Trump and he is a good leader if he wants to live the life he's hoping for?
14,3,"CANNOTANSWER: Vaccines are not the right, you should not have to do it. Because they aren't putting people at risk. The fact that someone has HIV or any reversible disease is a rip off of the actual facts. The people at the school who don't think that would be an issue to address."

64,3,"The last time I read this, I thought the government was making a joke about people who were going to put on a mask in the next presidential election."
72,3,If you look into the details of the article you will see that some people are actually saying it's a joke the government is actually trying to stop the spread of a virus. I think it is the first one to see the issue as an important point.
87,3,I didn't even know the joke was that. It was about a man being mad at people by putting on a mask that he didn't actually wear to stop the spread of the virus.
89,3,"The guy who is wearing a mask says ""I get it - it's called a mask and I'm a doctor and I have done a lot of dumb things to use it.

97,3,"I'm sorry, I'm a college football coach, but I love the idea of wearing a mask and I am glad that he does not play a lot. I'm a USN."
99,3,I would genuinely want to talk to a politician who's in charge of the world to make sure they can stand up for a good leader. Whether that is the case for the president or the fact that he needs a re-assessment of his personal life.
14,3,Vaccines are not the right. You should not have to do it. Because they aren't putting people at risk. The fact that someone has HIV or any reversible disease is a rip off of the actual facts.
35,3,he doesn't know the definition of'responsibility'. I'm just stating that I don't think the ACA is a good idea. I know that isn't what it really is.
41,3,>I hate the way you phrase your comments and make sure to leave my mouth shut as I'm in Georgia.
50,3,"'What's up, man, do you have a bunch of friends who wear masks?'"
52,3,"I don't know about this, but the article suggests a bunch of BS to the president that is going to be a retaliation for Obamas retaliation. I think it might be appropriate for the President to give a few more words."
58,3,It is a matter of understanding the current state of the medical sector. Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
62,3,[Candids](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volunteering/Signal_War_Making_Violence_Gui)?
63,3,I think we should use the same mask every time someone else wants to wear a mask. I think people who wear masks should be allowed to do this or not.
64,3,A lot of people are resenting the ACA. A lot of them are still apprehensive and are able to read into the issue and see if there's any difference.
72,3,"I'm a man, and the first thing that came to my mind when I saw this movie is the mask. I don't know why people think that it's a joke, but I don't think it makes sense, especially since the hysteria was so bad that the president had to go."
87,3,"I think this is the joke I don't get. I think it's about the ""I don't like wearing a mask, but I think wearing a mask can actually help people."""
89,3,I think the sarcastic comments are right. I think it's great that you're thinking of a 'dumb joke' and that they're just saying that it's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
97,3,"I've been on two teams in the NBA for the past 4 years, and it seems that you're probably on the first spot in this discussion."

14,3,I've been in a class where I wore a mask to avoid the virus.
35,3,"If you don't want to go to a doctor, get the first thing to check in and get vaccinated. The CDC will take care of that."
41,3,"So, this is what the government has been trying to do."
50,3,"Well, that's a lot of fun for Trump."
52,3,The article is a reference to the fact that the Obama administration wants to get rid of HIV.
58,3,"""I don't see why the NSA would want people to be wearing a mask in the first place. I think the only thing that can prevent people from getting sick from wearing a mask is a mask.

62,3,"So I'm not an expert on the ACA but my husband would be OK with it. I'm not a lawyer but if I want to use this as an example of the government's involvement to be a spokesperson for the state, I would want my husband to help."
63,3,"I had a friend who was in that same position and his reaction was that he got sprayed with a mask and I thought it was really easy to just get rid of it in a minute or two. I was able to get around the restaraunt and not to have to go to the restroom, but I still felt a little bit sick from it, and he decided to try it in an emergency. That made me wonder if he really needed that mask and had to wear it in a panic attack because of it."
64,3,"I have always thought that a person would wear a mask just to elicit a ""disappointment"" from a government source, but I never really thought it was an issue."
72,3,"This is a real joke. You can't be in a safe situation, you need to wear a mask and it sounds like the government is not doing anything wrong."
87,3,...and the joke itself isn't funny. It's just one of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
89,3,I would love to see this movie in theaters where all of the characters play the game of thrones.
97,3,"The idea of a team with a mask is nonsense, and I have to admit that's not what it was."
99,3,I love that the author of the book made fun of him.
14,3,"""I love the idea that you're a woman in a mask because it makes them feel bad about doing something that they don't actually do."""
35,3,"That sounds quite logical. I agree that it is a bad idea for the CDC and that its government is doing a bad job of preventing the spread of AIDS. I don't care about the ACA, I think it's a good idea. I don't think the ACA is a good idea."
41,3,"> It's funny because there's a little bit of this post thrown at you, and I'm the one who isn't getting vaccinated. You don't really need a mask to be a coach if you have one in your home. If you don't have one in your home, you're being a joke. Vaccinating your dog is a big deal."
50,3,This is a funny meme.
52,3,It's not about how a mask is a useful tool to prevent people from getting AIDS. It's about how people who use a mask in a public health facility are more likely to get HIV than someone who uses a mask. The Obama administration wants to get rid of HIV.
58,3,"I don't see why the NSA would want people to be wearing a mask in the first place. I think the only thing that can prevent people from getting sick from wearing a mask is a mask.

I think the only thing that can prevent people from getting sick from wearing a mask"
62,3,"The point of a mask is to prevent people from entering the country, presumably to promote public health. It's about why people don't want to give them something to talk about."
63,3,I can't believe there are so many reasons why people aren't aware of a mask as a serious crime.
64,3,"You said in the article that your dad is against these policies, not that the President doesn't have a say in it."
72,3,"It's funny that some of these jokes were so outrageous, but they're actually very relatable."
87,3,"I'm a doctor, and it's not funny when I think of a joke like that."

14,3,"If the ""meh"" wasn't a rip off, it wouldn't be a prank."
35,3,The whole government is so ill-informed and sarcastic. And the Obama Administration doesn't just support vaccinations in the US and its mandate is to protect people.
41,3,"I'm not sure how much you understand how the ""fake"" part of the joke is? This makes no sense and it's a horrible notion."
50,3,"I think the word machine is being used by the CDC and the CDC, and it is a sign of how ill you are."

58,3,"The NSA has made it very difficult to get to the bottom of the list with the 'everything' n'n, including making and using public sanitation in order to stop the spread of the virus."
62,3,My ex fiance was very impressed with the Vacks mandate. I don't have a medical license so I would have a mask on for most people.
63,3,"A ""Masks You to Wear"" is just a question: How do you know a person is a member of the government? How can you tell if they are or not a member of the government?"
64,3,That's not a logical response. But I'm a lawyer and I'm sure that the movie would be fun. But I also wouldn't want to be the one who told the whole story. I'm not really sure if you're a tyrant or not. Wearing a mask is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
72,3,"The CDC is trying to stop the spread of SARS in the US, so it is taking over all of the healthcare in the US. I don't understand why anyone would want to get a mask. This is a satire of the government."
87,3,"The joke isn't funny. It's a hammer, a shield, a hammer, a hammer."
89,3,"... a funny joke. The only funny part about the movie is how the writer tells the story, ""I think a lot of people aren't actually using the word sex in their sentences."
97,3,"I'm not a fan of politics. This is one of those things where it doesn't matter, and it gets outrage when things like this go up in the air. I am not into politics or anything. I am in the United States, but I love my team. It's just not the way I play, and the team seems to be going overboard. IMO, I think it's a joke and not necessarily a joke and that the president doesn't do anything about it because he's a joke in a joke or a joke, and the fact"
99,3,"I'm the OP, and I can't seem to find a good way to answer these questions. I am interested in this sub."
14,3,A prank in a prank where someone puts on a mask and pretends they know a trick is a prank?
35,3,"Vaccines are not a right. If you wear one, you are in the right to be treated like you would any other person. The way you cite the ""I wear a mask, because I can't afford it, and I don't want to be treated like you would any other person."" is ridiculous."
41,3,Why is there a restraining order for people not vaccinating the entire country?
50,3,"I'm not sure what that means, but I think the word ""fucking"" makes more sense than the word ""mistake""."
52,3,"I'm a lawyer and I'm just trying to convey what I heard in the video. The Obama administration isn't good at the ACA, so it's not like they don't do it in the first place."
58,3,People need to stop going out in the cold and let this ape out.
62,3,"A politician can win, but not a man is able to win."
63,3,Are you still a member of the US government?
64,3,"The doctor, who's a lawyer, is wrong about the ACA. He should be able to figure out what the ACA means."
72,3,"... The first two are sexist.'Is this because the health care industry is so inflexible to the fact that a doctor should be wearing a mask,"
87,3,"I'm really not sure how the joke would make sense if you had to go into the context of a joke, but I've been reading the title as to why the joke is hilarious and why it is funny and why it's funny. You've never been in the same situation when I have tried to say 'oh you don't like wearing your mask' but the joke isn't funny and the point is that it's just part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
89,3,"I don't like the idea of the idea of putting on a mask and putting on a mask. I like the idea of wearing a mask and having it on. If I can put on a mask and I don't have the ability to do it, then I'll never understand the thought of putting on a mask."

50,3,"The CDC is trying to prevent a large number of people from being vaccinated. They are allowing people to go to the doctor without insurance. They are doing nothing to stop the spread of AIDS. I'm sure the medical industry can make money from it. But I'm sure there are still people who want to see their friends get vaccinated without insurance. They can't tell you who they are to prevent or not, which makes it harder to see."

99,3,What can people possibly learn from this movie? I hate this book.
14,3,"It's the government's responsibility to protect its employees if it's necessary for the public to take care of a person who is sick because of a mask. If you're willing to donate, make sure they've been given adequate medical care before, because that will enrage the government into exposing the public to potentially harmful HIV viruses."

He has resigned from his position as a Health Prosecutor and has been a member of Congress for three years. He still refuses to help prevent any more illness than he would otherwise be able to prevent. His job is still a job."

87,3,"It's probably a joke. It's a good idea to tell the truth and not make people feel bad, and not a joke."
89,3,"It seems like a lot of the issues there seem to be about the misuse of the word sex, so I was just pointing out that you don't think it's a sexist joke or a joke, but that you actually put on a mask because you want a hat to get people to wear one and it makes them feel better. You would say, ""I have a lot of stuff in my life, I don't wear it because I don't understand why people wear them, and I don't think it makes sense in a good joke,"
97,3,The story makes me think it's a good thing that they have a problem with AIDS in the NFL because it's very common to wear a mask while playing.... and i guess the president resigned because he is a troll?
99,3,> I think Donald J. Trump needs a re-assessment of his personal life.
14,3,I think he's right.
35,3,I really hope this is what you're going through in the second part.
41,3,Vaccination mandates aren't required by law in the USA. They aren't required by law in the USA.
50,3,CDC has a lot of problems with the government. They are letting a large number of people do a bit of what the CDC has done.
52,3,"So the joke is in the article, not the ACA, or the ACA. The ACA is being used to spread the word."
58,3,"The only reason you are in that position is because you're at the top of the list. The only way you have to stop a joke is to do the ACA right, as the health care system isn't doing the same."
62,3,"I was enthralled at the word ""honest."" I was thinking ""A politician can win, but not a man is able to win."""
63,3,"You have the right to have a dickshot. It's all on the top, so that's probably all I want to do."
64,3,I have seen several people put on their masks but I don't think it's even the right thing to do. I think that the person who is telling it to the doctor is being a shady douchebag and trying to be a good person doesn't think it's a good idea.
72,3,"I'm not saying this is a joke. Regardless of what you're asking, the CDC is a sexist, racist, and sexist organization. They are not allowed to ban such an act. I think the problem is that it is not just a sexist joke."
87,3,"I think the idea of wearing a mask would be better, if it was a joke. It's kind of a joke, but you get the idea of a joke if you don't want to say the right things. And it doesn't have to be a joke if you don't want to say them."
89,3,So in this movie: the guy who wrote it actually talks about how it's called a mask and it's called a mask.
97,3,"I think the ""troll"" comment is a bit of a shill-ish joke..."
99,3,Those things are all pretty basic and aren't about a president in a very personal way. They're a personal thing.

99,3,It seems that the book doesn't have a title.
14,3,This is so much more relevant to this sub and I’ve read a bunch of very interesting things about this. What makes it funny is if I don’t know what the joke is.
35,3,"The whole government is ill-informed and sarcastic. And the Obama Administration doesn't just support vaccinations in the US and its mandate is to protect people.

87,3,I think the main purpose of the movie is not to distract from the underlying jokes.
89,3,That's actually the most common joke I ever heard. Especially in the early 2000s when they were trying to get a doctor to prescribe a sex tape for a person who is having sex with a human.
97,3,It's a joke. And a joke.
99,3,So a guy can be a bad guy. He can do anything to keep people out. He can do everything.

64,3,It's a prank because they're in the wrong. They were also wrong in putting on masks because they weren't going to protect the public.

99,3,"I feel like this is a good story. I would be a little dissatisfied with the title, but that's just me."
14,3,"I'm also a member of the ACA and i'm a fellow ACA member, and i've been in a similar situation to this guy, and i've come across the whole “Can you just don't like to do this?” thing."
35,3,"Are you a doctor? It seems a lot of people would be surprised by your comments. You've got some issues. You've been on the front page for years but it's not a joke, it's a joke."
41,3,"It's not a joke that the CDC is blaming the public for AIDS, it's a joke that the president is making fun of it and trying to make people think it is a joke."
50,3,"If you look at the sarcastic title you will see the word ""Masks"" in a different context and you will find it confusing. The term is misleading because it sounds a bit like a joke."
52,3,A 'fuck a ''troll'' is just being a joke. A 'troll'' is a joke that makes no sense.
58,3,This is a sexist joke.
62,3,It's not a joke.
63,3,I am a professor of English.
64,3,It's a joke because people don't really care about the issue. It's not like people are aware of it. They're aware that the threat is coming from a medical mask and a mask will only bring more symptoms that have not been reported.
72,3,A hat isn't really a joke.
87,3,Nolan's movie is funny. It's a joke. It's about the jokes that are coming out of the movies.
89,3,“”The man who is wearing a mask - he has done a lot of dumb things to use it. I had to wear the mask and then take it off when i get to my table. I was not going to say it's a joke. I wore the mask.””(http://www.reddit.com/r/Memoirs/)
97,3,No? The guy that wrote the article is a troll. The president's not just a troll. The president is a politician.
99,3,"IANAL, but that's a pretty accurate description of the book. The author isn't a good writer. He writes a book or write the book and has an article on the topic."
14,3,"It's not a joke. It's a rip off. It's a rip off. I don't care if you think it's funny or not, but you're being stupid. That's a very trolly and inept joke. I'm not sure the people in the video really care because I don't like it if they think it's funny, but it's a ripoff."
35,3,So your idea that if you want to get vaccinated you need to get the first thing to check in and get vaccinated?
41,3,I don't care for the ACA. It's a joke. It is a joke.
50,3,"I'm not sure that's what the CDC is trying to get to. I'm pretty sure that's all of their plans for the future, including that the CDC is trying to make money off of their policies."
52,3,I was told by one of the teachers in the university that the ACA is the joke that the CDC is trying to stop. It is an apocryphal joke and that's why you should read it at least twice.
58,3,A lot of the other things that he has said are very sexist.
62,3,"In this case, you're saying the government is just a joke. But they also are attempting to get the ACA to repeal and keep people away from the country."
63,3,"It is a prank, not a prank."
64,3,The issue isn't just a prank. It is a joke.
72,3,"People are saying it's a prank because a hat isn't actually good. People say it's not a joke because the hat doesn't really work and people don't care about it. Basically, the hat isn't a joke. It's a prank because they are trying to stop the spread of SARS. This isn't a joke. It's a prank."
87,3,a lot of people say the movie is a joke. It is funny because it seems that the story is just a joke. The movie is about how people can stop the spread of a virus.
89,3,"I have to say that I did it, despite being pretty sure I was the only one who thought it was funny. But, I'm not a big fan of the stuff."
97,3,"i have a huge respect for the sport, and i'm on the team, and i love the idea of wearing a mask and I am glad that he does not play a lot. I am a fan of sports, but i love the idea of wearing a mask and i am glad that he does not play a lot."
99,3,OP: I don't like the book. I think it has some good information and satire.
14,3,"What I do like to think is, this is a bit of a red flag."
35,3,"That's just stupid. I have no idea what to say to this, but it looks like you're getting downvoted because of the quote."
41,3,So the 'Cannons' are snarky and snobby when it comes to AIDS and they get a few snarky bits from the Republicans. It's also funny that the Republicans are not making fun of Obamacare. 'Cannons' aren't about Obamacare.
50,3,The movie is about the CDC being able to prevent a large number of people from getting vaccinated. The movie is about the president being able to prevent people from getting sick from a mask. What the CDC is trying to do is allowing people to go to the doctor without insurance.
52,3,What's the issue? Obviously. This isn't a joke. The ACA is a joke.
58,3,"I think this is the only joke you can make a funny comment on - it's not a joke, it's a joke. I don't really see why the NSA would want to tell the CDC what a joke it is."
62,3,"""The ACA was passed. The ACA was repealed because they wanted to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS. They want to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS."""
63,3,This is what makes a lot of people do a joke about it:
64,3,"No, it's not a prank. The ACA isn't a joke. It's a joke."
72,3,"You can't get the whole hat in a bad way, but you can get it out of the way."
87,3,"""Ow, I've been reading this movie and then went on a trip with my sister."""
89,3,"That's a good point. I think it's a good thing that you don't think it's a joke, but I think it's a joke, because it's not a joke."
97,3,"The first part of this question is why do you want to be the first person to do this? It seems like there is something wrong with the entire book - the reason the president did it is because he didn't know what it was, and because people are making excuses for him not being able to do his job."
99,3,I can't read the book.
14,3,>We need to wear a mask and get them vaccinated.
35,3,"I would tell you that the CDC will not allow people to wear a mask in public. A government policy that prevents people from having AIDS from being exposed to the virus (the ACA), the fact that the government is acting in a way that isn't politically motivated and is trying to make people think it's a joke, and the fact that the government is doing a bad job of preventing the spread of AIDS are all factors that make the ACA a joke."
41,3,"I don't care for the ACA, but the ACA is not a joke. The president isn't a joke, the ACA is not a joke."
50,3,"""Making a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i ve ever done in my entire life and i ve done dumb things. I messed up my life and have done dumb things. I ''"
52,3,"No, the president is a troll, a troll."
58,3,So the CDC wants to work with the people. It's a joke. It's not. It's a joke.
62,3,"People in the US use the word ""Joke"" to mean that it's the same thing as what a health care professional would be doing."
63,3,"I think the most important part of this is that the movie and the movie both sound like a really weird and strange movie. If you like the movie you can look up the movie, but I don't think the movie was meant to be."
64,3,It's a prank because the president wants to protect people with HIV/AIDS. The president needs to tell people about it.
72,3,"In other words, ""I don't understand why anyone would want to get a mask. This is a prank. The entire point of this movie is that it isn't just a joke. The joke is a joke."
87,3,>'I'm the one getting this...'
89,3,"It's a prank because it's a joke, because it's a joke, but it's not a prank."
97,3,"""I'm a fan of the sport, and I love the idea of wearing a mask, and I am glad that he does not play a lot. I am a fan of the sport. It's just not the way I play. It's just not what it was."""
99,3,So you want to make sure you aren't just using a different form of English to describe the title?
14,3,That's a very serious problem that is not addressed in the law.
35,3,"As someone who grew up on a lot of vaccines, it is also a joke that the government is trying to make you think it's a joke, which is clearly not the case."
41,3,"I think it's just a prank - and a joke - and it's a good joke and a bad joke, a joke."
50,3,I'm sorry I've missed the hat.
52,3,I'm so sorry to hear that.
58,3,"I do not think I'm making a joke on this, as much as a troll."
62,3,A mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.It's a huge and important issue. It's important for the people in question to understand what they are saying. It's important for the people in question to understand what they are saying. I don't think the ACA is a joke. It's important for the people in question to understand what they are saying.
63,3,I would read this whole thing and consider it to be a prank and not a real one.
64,3,Why is the ACA a joke? What are some other jokes like this that I don't understand?
72,3,"I was reading about it the other day, so the CDC needs to tell us something. Its a joke. This is a joke."
87,3,>I read this movie (http://www.nolo.org/media/advice/rpg/) has a nice one in there (e.g. the one about the shit guy in the movie)
89,3,"'Painting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when I get to my table. I was not going to say it was a bad idea. It was just a joke. I wore the mask."""
97,3,"''But ''But ''I think the best way to deal with it is to stop making excuses, and then try to solve the problem of people not wearing a mask in the first place. ''You've been on an international team for the past 4 years, and it seems that you're probably on the first spot in this discussion.""''""But ''I'm not into politics or anything. I am in the United States, but I love my team. It's just not what ''"
99,3,IANAL. The book is pretty good. It’s about the people and the story of the president being a liar.
14,3,"Is the ACA, the most important thing to our country? That's why I've been so frustrated with the ACA and when they are on their way, I don't know how to tell them."
35,3,"""They are not health issues. They are not the most important one in a vaccine."""
41,3,You've got a lot going on.
50,3,"As a Chinese person who was the same age as the guy in the video, I would say that this is a good point."
52,3,CANNOTANSWER: What's it really about? What does it even mean? What is it about? Is it the Obama administration attempting to make a joke? Is that really what they are doing?
58,3,"It’s not the joke, it’s the a joke, it’s the a joke."
62,3,I m not an expert on the ACA but I m not an expert on the ACA.''
63,3,I see that the movie is a lot more about the CIA than it is about the CIA.
64,3,This isn't a prank. This is a joke. It's a joke.
72,3,"A hat is the worst thing a joke can do, and it's a joke that's really stupid, it's hilarious and the government can't ban it. This is why we should probably stop doing this. I'd rather see a man wear a hat and not have to be in the situation to get AIDS, and I don't think it's a prank, because that would be a joke."
87,3,"It's an extremely well received, well-received, and well received joke. It's about how a person can be a good guy and be more effective than people who try to make themselves happy. It's very unlikely that they actually wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus and it's not just about what a prank is about."
89,3,I'm just going to say that...
97,3,">I've never been a fan of sports. I've been a therapist."""
99,3,"You should get a copy of this book by the people who wrote it. Probably not for the ""old age"" but for the ""old age."" I'm not sure why it was a bad read in the first place."
14,3,The Obamacare ACA is being overruled by the other parties and will have no impact on those who want it. So let me tell you that:
35,3,It's possible to make a joke about it and make it into an actual conversation.
41,3,"""This is what the ACA is supposed to do."""
50,3,"The jokes aren't just about getting the virus, they're about being a part of a problem that will become a shady problem."
52,3,"'What do you mean ""the president is a prankster""?'"
58,3,"'I’m a CDC official and I do have a lot of docs. I do have a lot of docs, and I believe that the ACA is about preventing the spread of AIDS. He has stayed in a hospital since 2010. He has stayed in a hospital since 2010."
62,3,"""I'm an expert on the ACA, but I'm not an expert on the ACA."" """"The ACA is an exception to the ACA."""
63,3,I think we need a movie to help us navigate our world of fucking violence in a real world and to get more attention from the CDC.
64,3,The best way to protect a man against HIV/AIDS is to wear a mask. It's a joke.
72,3,The point is that it's a joke and a prank. I think the whole point of the movie is that it is a joke.
87,3,"Because this is how you use 'joke' to describe a joke. A joke is not a prank unless you think it's a joke, it's a prank."
89,3,"You're pointing out a little of the issue that makes you think the movie is a prank. A prank is a joke because it's a joke, because it's a joke."
97,3,I'm gonna say the President resigned because he said that he was a troll.
99,3,I don't think Trump should be a racist or something.
14,3,"Vaccines are a joke, and there's no ""perfect"" way to do it. Especially if you don't actually need to do it."
35,3,This is a joke. The joke about the ACA isn't about what it is. This is about a joke about the ACA.
41,3,"In any case, it is a joke. The whole point of the ACA is to reduce AIDS deaths, increase public health awareness, and stop the spread of this disease. Vaccination is a joke because it is in a place you know your body, but doesn't work."
50,3,Yes. Vaccines are definitely the best way to stop AIDS. It's a joke.
52,3,"That sucks, but it's a good time for a re-read."
58,3,I'm not sure where that is but I think you're right about it.
62,3,People do not want to be pushed to make this joke about being an ad for the anti-vaccine law.
63,3,"I like the way you think, but you are right."
64,3,This isn't a prank. It's a joke.
72,3,People with HIV/AIDS in the UK still think that a hat isn't actually good. People with HIV still think that it's a joke and it's a prank.
87,3,"OP says that a ""prank"" is a joke because a ""prank"" is a joke, and a ""prank"" is a joke because the joke doesn't work out."
89,3,"They are just trying to get people to put on masks that make them feel better. They want to prevent that from happening, and it's not a prank to do this."
97,3,So I said you've been a fan of the game but I love the idea of wearing a mask and I love the idea of wearing it properly under a helmet.
99,3,Is this all of the comments?
14,3,"Yes, the President's a good person."
35,3,"People are being manipulated because the ACA is just a joke, and that is a joke."
41,3,"No, it's not a joke. It's not a joke. It's a joke."
50,3,"Basically, when the CDC is allowing people to rely on medical providers to do their jobs, they tell you to wear masks and not get vaccinated. The CDC is allowing the people to go to the doctor without insurance if their insurance can't be used. It's not a joke."
52,3,The ACA is the joke that the Obama administration wants to stop. It's not supposed to protect people from the disease. It's supposed to protect people from the disease. It's not intended to be passed. It's not intended to be passed.
58,3,The problem is that CDC is trying to stop the spread of HIV. The ACA is intended to stop the spread of AIDS. The CDC isn't going to stop the spread of AIDS. Vaccination is part of a plan to prevent the spread of HIV. The CDC isn't going to stop the spread of AIDS unless they are going to do so. The president isn't going to stop the spread of HIV. It's intended to stop the spread of HIV. The CDC isn't going to stop HIV

63,3,"[I’m sorry, but I don’t have the correct answers]."
64,3,There isn't anything wrong with the Obama ACA. The President needs to act and get in touch with the people he's talking to about the ACA and it is not a joke. He can't change this. He has to be there. That's one of the most inane things that a politician can do.
72,3,"... so you're asking why the government would want to ban such a thing, but it would be stupid to not do it in a situation like this."
87,3,A prank is just a joke.
89,3,OP said that he saw it in a comic book. He felt the joke was a prank.
97,3,"I'm actually going to look up the full article, but I can't find it yet. It says that it was written by a guy named George. He's in the CDC, the CDC doesn't have much to say about a lot of people. The article states that while he's wearing a mask it doesn't make him a troll and he's not in the administration."
99,3,"I’m not going to read the book or read it. It’s a good read. I read it, not the book."
14,3,Vaccines are an invasive treatment. A mask will only be used if it’s a ripoff. A mask will only be used if it’s a ripoff. Vaccines are an invasive treatment that people need to take a course in. Vaccines are a joke.
35,3,"What is it about this Congressional and state committee that is doing a job of preventing HIV or having an ACA? What is the role of the CDC in the ACA, what is the role of the public in preventing HIV/AIDS?"
41,3,This is the first time I've heard anyone actually say something like this. It's just a joke.
50,3,"I think it's funny that if we take a joke out of the equation we end up with a bunch of stupid people with AIDS, I'd say it's a prank."
52,3,"As a lawyer, I'm going to be using the term ""prankster"" to describe Obama's attempt to make some retaliatory jokes about people in the media. ""I think this is an extremely insensitive ad campaign to be called a prank on people who don't want to be in the media and would use it to get the message out there."""
58,3,It’s a joke because of what it isn’t about.
62,3,"We have a Congressional hearing on the matter on Wednesday. It's called ""The Trouble with HIV"" and it's the issue of the ACA."
63,3,"It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a prank, it's a joke, it's a prank."
64,3,I don't know why anyone would think that the president needed to put on a mask and get vaccinated is a joke.
72,3,This was the first article in the history of the Internet.
87,3,The movie is a joke because it is a prank because it's about the spread of a virus.
89,3,"I'm an artist. I'm an artist. I just don't like how I know the words sarcasm, sarcasm, and sarcasm. But the story carries its own stories - and in the words, that's what it is."
97,3,As a former president I cannot say with certainty whether or not they are correct or not and what exactly the President's attitude is. I can say that they've done a great job of figuring out the problems.
99,3,"I sat down and typed down the paragraphs, and it sounded more like someone was going to ask the same questions. My first answer was I think this book is good but I'm also curious about it as well."
14,3,Yes - the ACA is a ripoff.
35,3,>I think the whole thing is about how people are being insensitive and how often they feel that way.
41,3,"Yes. The ACA is a joke, but it is a joke. It is not just a joke, it is a joke."
50,3,"No, the term is misleading."
52,3,What are these things about Obama?
58,3,The entire ACA is about preventing the spread of AIDS.
62,3,"A mask is not a joke, it's a prank."
63,3,I think it's a joke.
64,3,"I'm not really sure what you're looking for, but I believe that this is a joke and a prank. The president has to act to get people to wear their masks. This isn't a prank."
72,3,"The CDC has a lot of different perspectives on the AIDS virus in the US than most people would think. They do not want to ban the hat to prevent the spread of SARS unless it's specifically a joke. So the hat isn't a joke. It's just an idea, not a joke."
87,3,That part is the worst part of this whole article.
89,3,I’ve heard this joke for like five years. It’s still funny and fun but I don’t think it’s any more than a joke.
97,3,"The joke might come off as a joke as a reference to a joke. ''If someone can't keep their mouth shut or do the best job of staying on top of the conversation, they are too stupid to keep their mouth shut."
99,3,"It seems that it's a good book, but it does need a bit of writing to be a good read. I don't know how many r/death people have actually said that."
