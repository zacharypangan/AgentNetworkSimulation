67,65,i m not against vacks mandates cuz i don t think i ll catch the cough i already had it i m against them cuz they ruin the economy get people fired and people should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force

94,65,i wear my mask when i m in public lawmaker who isn t wearing his mask in public says
100,65,oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that
65,4,The school did not like the mask public health order.
65,6,I'm sure the other gov't members would be more upset by the mask public health order.
65,7,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
65,12,"It's because a mask helps prevent the spread of a virus, not because of it."
65,16,"The law would have required us to wear a mask, if you're in the public health department"
65,26,One of the members of the commission in this thread had a comment from someone from the community about a school that did not use masks on citizens.
65,27,It doesn’t matter if the school chose to opt out.
65,32,"The government must be accountable for this, including their actions. They must be accountable for putting a state's children and grandchildren at risk and keeping that from them and the people who care for them. They can't be accountable for their actions."
65,35,"They are both for the safety of the people, and they are for the right of others to fuck with people like you and me."
65,40,They also did a good job with the health dept of douglas county.
65,41,What is the problem with a vaccinated person who is on the street or outside in public?
65,44,If they would have passed a mandate to not be the most effective in the country it wouldn't have happened if they were on the ballot.
65,60,We have to have a law that does not require you to wear a mask or get the jab.
67,65,I think you need to get a mask..but I'm not against that.
75,65,I want to buy the sd vaccinity vaccine on my phone to wear at a local vaccinity booth at a party i love and go to
78,65,A helmet is a sign that someone whose face is not visible is ill if someone tries to take it off to protect themselves.
81,65,>Hey maroon is wearing a mask after i left my helmet on and the people that were wearing it said I should be wearing it after they did their job.
94,65,Then it is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
100,65,Ooh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that
65,4,> What is the problem with a vaccinated person who is on the street or outside in public?
65,6,It's not about the mask itself. It's about the government’s intention to put their kids and grandchildren at risk.
65,7,"This is what people are supposed to believe, that the only way to stop a virus is through a vaccination vaccine, because it's dangerous?"
65,12,"You don't have to wear a mask or get the jab if you don't want to be covered. You can't put a mask on a person, you're paying for the jab."
65,16,">They must be accountable for this, including their actions."
65,26,"The state has a very strong public health system and they would need to get a 'failure' to do the best they can, regardless of a'mask' or not."
65,27,This is about the CDC not the health departments themselves.
65,32,"He's being decried because of what he said. It doesn't sound like he's defending his own beliefs on a personal level. He's saying that it's because he likes wearing a mask, and not because he can't wear a mask. It's just one part of a much larger scheme to decriminalize people if they can afford it."
65,35,We have a public health agency that is an agency. We don't get to make any decisions at all in a government system. It's a tool to help prevent people from getting sick and also to encourage citizens to be proactive.
65,40,I don't know how you're going to know why a school would opt out because of the mask.
65,41,"I don't understand you. The op was not talking about how the school did not like the mask public health order, but it was simply a question of what the school did, because they were on the ballot, and the health department wanted to do something about it."
65,44,"The government's policies have been in place since 1997, so they would have been on the ballot."
65,60,What do you mean. It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. The school did not like the mask public health order. I'm sure the other gov't members would be more upset by the mask public health order.
67,65,"Why not just make sure you get a mask? That's the only way I could do that. Whenever I had a cough, I would have to wear one that wasn't too bad."
75,65,"I would say: 'Oh my God, I can't go on that - I'll be late for the party'"
78,65,I don't think the question of wearing a mask is really relevant.
81,65,... and you wear a mask? Do you know how this has happened? Putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i ve done in my entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask... and you wear a mask? Do you know how this has happened? Putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to
94,65,"The NSA has something to do with that, and I don't think they are going to change it."
100,65,oh hey maroon i am sorry to tell you that You guys are too young to tell me this. You should wear a mask. It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having
65,4,"No matter what your parents do and do not think of vaccine as a vaccinating measure, the state must be accountable for their actions. This is not about the mask itself. It's about the government's intention to put their kids and grandchildren at risk."
65,6,"In the United States, wearing a mask is considered a medical malpractice, and so is wearing a mask, especially when you're in a public health hospital."
65,7,They could go on vacation with the CDC to visit someone else in the family. It was an amazing thing they could do to a friend - and it was a good investment for us and the school he went to. The school had been very cooperative about this. There is no such thing as'shock' in a public health department that could have prevented a public health emergency because of it.
65,12,"You don't have to wear a mask if you don't want to be covered. You can't put a mask on a person, you're paying for the jab."
65,16,A good friend of mine and his wife have been on the same ward with the same cough when we were at school. That means they have to eat a liqiu and keep the cough away from them. He's already said they are going to put a mask on him because they feel like they are being put at risk and they just can't find it.
65,26,Why wouldn't the school take it up to the govt to do something about it?
65,27,"They have a very strong public health system and they would need to get a 'failure' to do the best they can, regardless of a'mask' or not. They must be accountable for this, including their actions."
65,32,"""We have a public health agency that is an agency. We don't get to make any decisions at all in a government system."""
65,35,It was just about the CDC. They're the only ones addressing the issue at hand.
65,40,"They want to make sure people are getting vaccinated, and in the interest of the public good."
65,41,This was a discussion I was having with the principal. When was it a red flag?
65,44,a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
65,60,"- because the government needs to stop putting themselves at risk. It's very simple, no one should be putting the public health department on the wrong track. If someone wants to be vaccinated, they should just take their own life and move on. I'm not sure how he is in this."
67,65,I am so angry at the government for refusing to protect me. I was told that we should have the freedom to choose what to wear as a safety precaution. I have an issue with the lack of a single policy to prevent people from using a mask and having to wear one that is not too bad.
75,65,I think it's more because they're not willing to work hard on them.
78,65,It's not a joke.
81,65,"He has no morals based on this. A lawmaker isn't a liar, a troll. The government can make a government figure who isn't a government figure."
94,65,This is the most common misconception I've encountered in any public health situation - the lack of a health care provider who cares enough to do all of the right things without needing a mask. I can't believe this has never been done.
100,65,I'm a man who wears a mask all the time to fight cancer and his family.
65,4,"So, you're defending the mask, and the schools for not putting a mask on the other students, and in the US, not wanting to provide anyone with access to the CDC?"
65,6,"IANAL, but I believe if a government organization has a policy like this, then they aren't going to be as good as it appears to be. The reason they are so incompetent is because a large percentage of the public care that they receive is due to lack of resources and therefore they have a problem with this."
65,7,"What's the worst part about being able to ah, go out and do something good if you think there's a good chance of the CDC putting you at risk? It's a medical malpractice and it's very much a health care policy, it is not a health care policy."
65,12,"I'm pretty sure that the school's governing authority is based on a principle that if it doesn't fit the law, it should have a ""discharge"" to do so."
65,16,He was going to get a mask - he was going to get a mask - but they didn't bother. They 'delete' the mask to make them feel safe.
65,26,"It sounds like the school could have used the same precautions a ten year old was in, but I wouldn't feel it was appropriate for it to be on the schools hands. I don't really know. The school is probably right to keep putting on masks."
65,27,"You can't even get a mask on your own neck while being vaccinated - there's nothing you can do, and the public health agency can't make a mistake when they can't make it on your neck and even then they can't even do it on your own neck."
65,32,[Note to self: I don't know how to say that in a public health context.
65,35,> I'm a man who wears a mask all the time to fight cancer and his family.
65,40,This is the biggest problem I've encountered in public health situations.
65,41,The CDC is the only public health agency in the nation that provides protection for people who do not wear a mask. That means the state doesn't have to do anything about it.
65,44,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
65,60,The CDC is doing something to save lives in the CDC. They must be responsible for their actions.
67,65,"I have nothing to say about the government and the government itself, I'd say it's not a good thing. It's a really, really snarky thing to say."
75,65,"A lot of people here are making it so that you can't claim that you have to wear a mask. People don't necessarily need a mask, they're just saying there's not enough time to get a vaccine."
78,65,It's not a joke. It's an example of why people think it is so important.
81,65,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I would be a doctor who is trying to treat it... I've been wearing a mask in public my entire life. It's all about the mask.
94,65,I think it's more important to wear a mask than the guy who doesn't.
100,65,"Having a mask to combat a disease is not the same as being a dick. It is the same way you say ""I don't know what it is I'm just like you. I don't know what it is but I don't know what it is but I don't know how to eat it so that I'm not feeling bad"". I've been told it works. It is a good thing I am not a dick. Having a mask is like being a joke."
65,4,The school is probably right to keep putting on masks. You can't even get a mask on your own neck while being vaccinated. That means the state doesn't have to do anything about it. The CDC is doing something to save lives in the CDC. They must be responsible for their actions.
65,6,"As someone who doesn't like the government, I think it's nice to see a public health department and see what happens."
65,7,CANNOTANSWER: Is there a special case where a medical emergency is involving a student undergoing a procedure or even having to do it?
65,12,I think people shouldn't feel bad about wearing masks. That's like being an 'all of the time' joke.
65,16,> I think it's more important to wear a mask than the guy who doesn't.
65,26,So this is what it is that would be a good thing? It is.
65,27,I've been vaccinated all the time. You have no need to get a mask or a hat. You need a helmet.
65,32,CANNOTANSWER? Hmm. I just don't know what that means for me.
65,35,They can't do the things they want without actually needing to. The reason the CDC is ignoring the issue is because it is ineffective and doesn't have the resources necessary to do the right thing.
65,40,>I'm a man who wears a mask all the time to fight cancer and his family.
65,41,"I'm gonna get off on this one. I don't know if that's all I can say, but as a medical professional who uses a mask, I have to tell you that there is no harm to getting vaccinated when you're not wearing a mask. I don't know how to make my mouth swell. I can eat a large bowl of chocolate, which if you're feeling it, can have some nice creamy cream with some vinegar and a little salt of water on the side, which are great for you. But I don"

67,65,"I'm an idiot, but the fact is that the government is trying to stop AIDS is pretty amazing. The government is trying to do something to stop that."
75,65,I... Is a mask part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
78,65,It's not a joke. It's a prank.
81,65,... It is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. This is the sort of joke that makes everyone cringe when it comes to the president and remark that it's bad for you.
94,65,People are not stealing. I'd go and find out what a medical emergency is.
100,65,"The question is: ""What was I doing to help myself?"""
65,4,"People want to know what a medical emergency is, because they're not going to be able to have access to the government."
65,6,I don't get why people don't get sick as a result of being vaccinated all the time. I think that's one reason the government isn't working. The CDC is doing something to stop a virus.
65,7,"[Roughly half of the states have a policy allowing kids to wear a mask, despite being at the age of 18]."
65,12,"Yes, it's funny, I don't."
65,16,"[As someone who doesn't like the government, I think it's nice to see a public health department and see what happens. I'm a man who wears a mask all the time to fight cancer and his family."

65,27,"It's pretty amazing that the CDC isn't willing to work with patients who aren't in a position to provide proper protection to the public, in fact, the program is supposed to be effective for the people who are."
65,32,"In this case, it would be a'sucker' for the government to try to put a mask on your face so that if you got caught in an outbreak, you would not be able to get vaccinated. In that case, it's a prank on you for being not able to get it on, which is really not an acceptable response."
65,35,A school with one or two masks would not get enough support for putting a mask on their students. A school can't get enough support. It's just part of the system.
65,40,It's the first time I've heard a prank in this subreddit.
65,41,It's the most important thing I've seen in my life and I have nothing to do with it.
65,44,"If the school is not addressing this, it doesn't matter....it's a prank."
65,60,If you're not wearing a mask then why don't you just get to know the state and then get a medical diagnosis?
67,65,"The fact that the government is trying to stop AIDS is amazing. The government is trying to stop it. I'm an idiot, but the fact that they are trying to stop it is pretty amazing."
75,65,I think the NSA should be able to prevent the spread of AIDS.
78,65,"It's the ACA. If we're able to get the vaccine to be on the road or bus, people can wear a mask, but the problem isn't the mask, the ACA isn't really the way to get a vaccine. It's not a joke, but I think it's a prank."
81,65,"A lot of times, even in a joke, we're just going to call a joke, but in reality, the whole issue is a joke. I think the whole point of the ""I'm a man"" movie is that this is a joke, which means ""We need to start a new generation of coaches that are able to understand the consequences of what they are doing."""

100,65,"A mask is not a dick when someone is harmed by HIV. There's a reason it is not a mask, and that's only because someone can be infected. It's a mask that's made to be worn by people who don't care about their health. It's a mask. It's for the specific area of your body, like your neck and a certain amount of skin lining."
65,4,I think you're defending the CDC because it's trying to stop AIDS.
65,6,"It is a joke. You seem like a dick, not a doctor or anything. I'm sorry."
65,7,"I think that is pretty amazing. But what isn't hilarious is that in our society we can't have a specific type of treatment for a disease that isn't easily available to us, that's what we want to have. In our society we're forced to choose the kind of treatment we want, and in this country we need those who have the right to care for ourselves."
65,12,"It's not a joke, it's the joke."
65,16,I figured people were going to wear a mask on me.
65,26,"I've never heard of any school that isn't going to do something about it, so I'm not really sure what's being discussed. I'm referring to the state being a dick to someone harmed by AIDS, but it seems that a lot of people who aren't vaccinated are not really familiar with it, and it's pretty obvious that they aren't being told about it."
65,27,There are so many factors affecting public health that they're almost certainly not going to change anything.
65,32,"The CDC is trying to prevent it, but not for a prank, it's because of an illegal bill that allows the government to cover all the bases for the medical crisis that plagues the world."
65,35,They aren't tackling the issue and aren't taking it seriously. They are actually doing something to improve the patient experience.
65,40,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.The question is: ""What was I doing to help myself?"" People want to know what a medical emergency is, because they're not going to be able to have access to the government."
65,41,You are a child who's not getting vaccinated for HIV. That isn't a joke.
65,44,Those are some of the most important things I've encountered in public health situations. The CDC is the only public health agency in the nation that provides protection for people who do not wear a mask. That means the state doesn't have to do anything about it.
65,60,"Those are the 'bad things' about public health, which is actually how the US has the public health department."

78,65,"""I don't think the question of wearing a mask is really relevant."""
81,65,The movie has a lot of great jokes about how the government is using it to stop the spread of a virus.
94,65,... it's not enough to make the government a bad place to be.
100,65,Yes it's a mask. A mask is a mask for a specific area of your body.
65,4,In the future the people would have to take responsibility for their own actions.
65,6,So why is it called a joke?
65,7,"It's so bad, but I can understand why this is funny."
65,12,'This is a ridiculous joke.
65,16,I'm a kid who wears a mask all the time to fight cancer and his family.
65,26,"The first part is a lie, sarcasm."
65,27,I agree with you on the CDC. It's like an AIDS joke. A CDC member questioned the safety of a person who has been vaccinated for AIDS. They questioned whether or not their treatment of the patient should be given a proper antibiotic before being vaccinated or not. They aren't able to say for sure what type of vaccine they use or not.
65,32,"I just want to say that it makes no sense to be able to look at your face in the picture. If I can't get vaccinated, I would be able to look at that face in the same way you would when you are not able to get vaccinated. I would not have the courage to try it."
65,35,"If you can't afford the mask, you should quit wearing it. It's not that you have to wear it, it's that you don't want to be treated like you would any other person."
65,40,"As a parent who has a CDC mask, I want to tell you this, I think we should just stop wearing it, because it's not going to help the situation and that the government isn't going to get involved in it."

78,65,The ACA is the one thing that's prank-worthy.
81,65,">I have never felt comfortable wearing a mask, and I'm always in a state where we were all wearing a mask."
94,65,"It is a good idea to wear a mask when a person is being attacked. It sounds like a good idea, and a good one. It is also the best way to give people a better chance of doing their job, and that is why people wear masks."
100,65,IANAL - I've been a doctor for five years and my friend's wife is a doctor. She was diagnosed with HIV/Aids and told me that she wore a mask all the time to help her health.
65,4,"Despite this, I don't think this is ""a joke,"" it's a prank."
65,6,"It's a joke. It's a joke. And it's a joke. If I were in your shoes, I'd just wear it."
65,7,"A family member and his family, in turn, all wear a mask when the person is at risk for illness or disability. The problem is, they have different reasons, not because they need it, but because they don't need it. A friend has a mask and she wears it because she's sick and needs treatment, because she can't get a virus from her own body, because her family can't."
65,12,"It's not just the CDC. They are trying to change the ACA, but the CDC is also trying to change their stance on AIDS."
65,16,It's like when someone wears a mask they're in a coma. They're in a coma.
65,26,"In other words, you need to wear a mask to ward off AIDS, and then get an IV."
65,27,"Is the CDC the one that is trying to cut the cost of the vaccine? If not, the public health department should be able to make the decision."
65,32,That CDC does not want to prevent the spread of HIV in the US but it doesn't want to be the cause of it because it's an illegal thing to do.

65,44,The mask is actually part of the measures deployed by the CDC to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. Yes it's a mask. A mask for a specific area of your body. In the future the people would have to take responsibility for their own actions.
65,60,"It's one thing to get a doctor to get vaccinated - to take a face, a mask, a mask."
67,65,"I think he may have a repercussion on those policies as well, but that's pretty much what is going on. He's obviously not a bigot. He doesn't have anything to say about the government, and he's clearly not interested in the government and isn't trying to change anything in the name of social justice."
75,65,"I was also vaccinated. The CDC is not a government agency, but a party to the ACA. This is a very unpopular opinion. It's not only the government's responsibility to stop the spread of a virus, it is also the government's responsibility to prevent the spread of the virus."
78,65,I don't think the idea of wearing a mask is anything more than a joke.
81,65,>The problem is the NSA is using that to control the AIDS epidemic – they are trying to take advantage of it by using a fake health insurance policy for people with AIDS who can't get access to health care – in order to try to prevent this from happening.
94,65,That's pretty much why you wear a mask to stop a virus from spreading around.
100,65,A doctor does not wear a mask to prevent others from breathing. It is a mask for the specific areas of your body.
65,4,"The question is whether people can be given a good mask for a health care emergency, but if they can't afford it, they shouldn't wear it."
65,6,"... he's trying to get the CDC to support his stance on AIDS, and I think that's a joke."
65,7,I think you're reading a very interesting article with some good insights.
65,12,It's like being an 'all of the time' joke.
65,16,The issue here is that the CDC should take on the burden of addressing the AIDS epidemic as much as possible.
65,26,"The school should be responsible for the prevention of the spread of AIDS, which is a good thing."
65,27,"If it isn't illegal to use a mask, we should stop."
65,32,"It is also possible that the CDC uses this to influence policies. And a group of people from the US aren't going to be able to buy a cheap, standardized virus vaccine to get sick without their own permission."
65,35,"There is no way you can go out of your way to fight AIDS. You have to go in a mask that is not actually a mask. Vaccines are not a right. If you wear one, you are in the right to be treated like you would any other person. The way you cite the ""I wear a mask, because I can't afford it, and I don't want to be treated like you would any other person."" is ridiculous."
65,40,It isn't going to make a difference in what's happening.
65,41,"There are a number of ways to prevent AIDS. It seems like you're comparing the CDC, CDC and DHS with the CDC and it seems like the DCDA's stance on AIDS is not very helpful."
65,44,"People get their own opinions on this a lot, and don't seem to take that seriously either. It's all about putting the person in a position of authority and protecting the people themselves, not the government. And then there's the problem of who they can vote against, not on how to stop it."
65,60,"I think your comment would raise a significant discussion on what is happening in the US. A mask can be a medical device, and is used to treat people with HIV/AIDS. I don't believe you can't take care of yourself without a mask."
67,65,"""Winning a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.The President is a tyrant who wants to get rid of any form of health care."""
75,65,Is it illegal to use a mask for a drug?
78,65,There's a lot of talk about a prank in there.
81,65,>This is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.This is a joke. The idea of wearing a mask is sexist and inappropriate. The NSA are using the AIDS virus as an excuse to use it. They are making a film about it so they can avoid it.
94,65,"I mean, it would be nice if there was an NSA NSA-sponsored program, but this is a bad idea. I don't know, really, what to say. I mean, it is possible to get a better shot, and I can't pretend to be one, I just don't want to be the one who is causing the problem. But that is the kind of thing that happens with us government workers. It's not like the NSA has a really bad idea."
100,65,It's about how the stigmas in a person can cause people to feel insecure or unable to take care of themselves.
65,4,"I think the question is whether people can be given a good mask for a health care emergency, but if they can't afford it, they shouldn't wear it. The answer is: I don't think the issue is a joke."
65,6,I'd wear a mask for a treatment that carries a virus.
65,7,"It would be stupid to do it so quickly, because people in the US would not want to be forced to care for themselves."
65,12,I think that's a great way to take the CDC's position and keep their head down.
65,16,I would be in the mood for this a lot.
65,26,"'I don't know what to say. I mean, it is possible to get a better shot, and I can't pretend to be one, I just don't want to be the one who is causing the problem.'"
65,27,I think it's interesting that a doctor from douglas county voted against the mask public health order and one did not vote due to affiliation to a school.
65,32,"You've been on the front page for some time and were actually really ignorant to what the article was about, except for the comment about why the government hasn't gotten involved in the AIDS epidemic as a whole and why people aren't going to understand."
65,35,I gotta read that shit all over my phone.
65,40,Using a mask to prevent AIDS is a prank.
65,41,It's not a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.
65,44,The thing that I think you mean is that the CDC is not legally the most powerful agency in the nation in terms of health care.
65,60,I don't know how you don't like this prank. Is the CDC involved in AIDS control?
67,65,It sounds like the government is trying to stop the spread of AIDS.
75,65,"I'm sure your mother would love that. She would be late for the party or even if they didn't have any mandates for vaccination. I'm not saying the ACA is a bad example of retribution or anything, but it's a good example of government retribution."
78,65,The ACA is a joke and is being put in place because it is a joke and it does not address the issue of vaccinating people without a mask.
81,65,I don't believe you.
94,65,"This isn't ""fake"" evidence, just a common misconception."
100,65,">The problem isn’t just the stigma, but the stigma attached to it."
65,4,"The question isn't just the stigma, but the stigma attached to it."
65,6,"What is the joke? You don't want to see your own medical malpractice insurance, and you want your children to be vaccinated. You don't want them to suffer from the same disease you have in the long run. You want the government to take care of their kids. They're trying to reclaim money because they don't have insurance."
65,7,"It's hilarious. But despite what we've seen from all over the world, it's so sad that we can't have a specific type of treatment that isn't easily available to us, that's what we want."
65,12,"I think you're being a bit crazy. There are more issues that need to be addressed. You're a little crazy, I'm pretty sure, but that's not what is causing the problem."
65,16,I don't see why this is a good example of government retribution.
65,26,The whole situation was incredibly racist. I don't think it's about the school's ability to do the best they can. This isn't about the government allowing it. This is about the state acting in a bad way and bringing them down.
65,27,There is an important discussion to be had about how we're going to get rid of this type of stigma in America today.
65,32,This isn't really a retribution. It's not a retribution. It's not a retribution.
65,35,It's so ironic that you say he's referring to the fact that the CDC is doing something to improve the patient experience and not only by ignoring the issue of AIDS. He was talking about how the CDC can't actually do the things they want without actually needing to. Besides that the CDC is being shady because they aren't addressing it.
65,40,"I think the problem isn't just the stigma, but the stigma attached to it. I think it's about how stigmas in a person can cause people to feel insecure or unable to take care of themselves."
65,41,"The problem isn’t just the stigma, but the stigma attached to it."
65,44,"What's the difference between ""using a mask"" to prevent AIDS and ""fake"" evidence?"
65,60,"I'm sorry, but I don't think you are referring to the health issue as the problem, but the CDC is in fact a very powerful agency in the CDC's power in terms of health care."
67,65,The President is a tyrant and a tyrant who wants to stop the spread of AIDS.
75,65,"I am a doctor and I have been told for years that in order to prevent and spread viruses like AIDS it is illegal to use a mask. It is only illegal for me if it is a medication, I can't wear one but I can buy one to help me get my vaccinated, I have to vaccinate."
78,65,It's not a joke. It's a joke that everyone is willing to prank on.
81,65,He's trying to get people to use the AIDS vaccine as an excuse to use it.
94,65,"It seems a bit of a waste of time, and is a good way to bring up some of the issues that I have read. I find the whole idea pretty shitty, and it's actually just not working."
100,65,What does the name of this post mean to me? This is not a health issue.
65,4,The problem isn't just the stigma attached to it. The problem isn't just the stigma attached to it.
65,6,"This is so weird and bizarre and you don't really have to ask ""Why do you think that we're going to have an emergency?"""
65,7,"It's a funny rant, but I can understand why you're being a bit crazy. What is the difference between ""using a mask"" to prevent AIDS and ""fake"" evidence?"
65,12,"Yes, but it's also ridiculous when you think about what we're actually doing with AIDS."
65,16,"You should think about the idea that ""people who do not think of themselves as ""people who know themselves"" are more concerned about their own health than the fact that there are many Americans who don't see a CDC."
65,26,I don't know why it is racist. What's causing this kind of issue in America?
65,27,There's a lot of stuff that the health dept does to help prevent the spread of AIDS.
65,32,"The issue is the government. If the government doesn't put in a mask and people aren't vaccinated, that's it."
65,35,No wonder you are being a bit crazy. This is not a real issue. It's not a joke. It's a joke.
65,40,"If there's an issue, it's the mask and a mask, not a mask. There's no need to stop using a mask when there is a serious, unforeseen health problem."
65,41,This is a lot of racist rhetoric that is just not true.
65,44,"I think it's time to ask myself. I don't want to be a doctor, so I don't know what I do. Besides, the health care issue is a very serious issue, and I'm trying to tell you that it should only be addressed by people who haven't been infected with the virus."
65,60,"That was so obnoxious. Regardless of the fact that I said it, I feel like I'm just joking."
67,65,"If we want to do something, we should work with the people we elect to the White House."
75,65,This is the government's problem. We don't have the right to tell a story and give a shit and get in trouble and then to stop them.
78,65,I have to say it was pretty good to see that the ACA was actually a prank. I feel like the ACA is going to be a prank and we're probably going to need it a lot more than that.
81,65,The government can make a political figure who isn't a government figure and that is what the NSA is doing. It is trying to use it to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS and to give people more protection.
94,65,>What does being an NSA agent have to do with getting a man to be wearing a mask? I think it's pretty cool that you don't like the idea of it.

65,12,"I'm not sure where you are going with ""I feel like I'm just joking."" This is a weird and bizarre rant, but I can understand why you're being a bit crazy. What does being an NSA agent have to do with getting a man to be wearing a mask?"

65,41,"What? I'm a medical professional who uses a mask and I'm saying that I'm not concerned about my genitals and the risks associated with the disease. What's more, the CDC doesn't want to use it to prevent HIV. The mask is a joke. It's the government's problem. We need to work with them, not the CDC."
65,44,The problem is that it's so stupid and irrelevant to the issue that it's unavoidable. The CDC was a joke in the early '80s and they lacked the authority to stop a virus that had already spread. We should have just called it a prank.
65,60,"Yes, we must put our mask on every single person on the planet. We are able to get a virus, we need a new health care system, we can get treatment, we are getting better, we are able to get a disease, we can get a healthy body. We can all get an AIDS cure and we need to get the CDC and the FDA into action."

65,44,Those are some of the most important things I've encountered in public health situations. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

65,27,The CDC is using the CDC's AIDS information to prevent the spread of AIDS. It's been proven that people who were vaccinated should get the CDC to provide the necessary protection for people with AIDS.
65,32,This is one of the most important things I've encountered in public health situations. It's a shame that the CDC isn't willing to work with patients who aren't in a position to provide proper protection for the people who are.

And I think it's just a nice little thing for someone who doesn't care about their health to not bother wearing a mask. He's also trying to push his own agenda. He's being insecure that it's a big deal."
65,4,Vaccination isn't the issue. It's the problem.

94,65,"It isn't a good idea. It is a good idea. I don't think anyone would want to put a mask on the person being attacked. In that case, we would want to see if the mask isn't a bad idea."
100,65,"I don't even care if he wears a mask. The way he is responding is ""no, I think that's what people are saying because the stigma doesn't necessarily stop people from wearing a mask."""
65,4,"This is not a joke, it's a prank."
65,6,The problem is the government's incompetence. I can't imagine them making it worse.
65,7,"The whole ""Mashup"" is not funny. It's not a joke. Unless you're talking about the CDC. ""People are at a high risk of getting a serious infection. If they are at risk of getting HIV, the situation isn't much different than it is."""
65,12,"Why don't you just say ""I don't like wearing a mask when I can't get into a job,"" and then get a restraining order when you can't get into a job?"
65,16,It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
65,26,"It's been reported in the USA as a 'disorder' of school board members to put on a mask on someone who wasn't getting the treatment they needed, not a 'war' against the state."
65,27,"I like the title. ""I think that if you're a dick, I think you need a mask."""
65,32,"As someone who is in the US, I am pretty sure I’m wrong about the entire government in this case."
65,35,He's a racist and doesn't like the CDC in general. That's pretty gross.
65,40,"Because I think this is a joke. ""... because I think that's a joke."
65,41,"If he is not a doctor and his position doesn't matter (they have no say in the whole world, of course) he has nothing to gain from the ACA and he is trying to make sure it's a public health system and not an agency that has to fight for it if it's going to happen."
65,44,"Nope. Not funny, but not a joke. CDC is being pushed to the limit by CDC because people with HIV don't get vaccinated in public. The CDC is also trying to help people with HIV."
65,60,It's like a joke and a joke. What are you doing here?
67,65,I'm not a bigot. The government is trying to stop AIDS. The president is a tyrant who wants to get rid of anything because he can't do anything that is supposed to stop the spread of AIDS.
75,65,"CDC is NOT involved in this, but is involved in it. They are not affiliated with it. The ACA isn't an exception. The CDC is an exception. The ACA isn't an exception."
78,65,"You are right, the joke isn't about it. It's about the people who aren't even aware of it."
81,65,This is about a joke. There are many examples of this remark.
94,65,"I'm sorry to say that. That's a pretty bad idea. But in general, I think you guys have the wrong idea. That's why if we go to a doctor and let the person who was attacked wear a mask in public, we are getting better treatment for the virus and if they start to die, we will be a mess. I think this idea is a terrible idea and that's probably because we don't have a health care provider who cares enough to do all of the right thing."
100,65,The only one that seems to make sense is that it seems like the mask isn't really needed to stop people with AIDS from talking about it.
65,4,The CDC has been trying to make a joke of the ACA and it has ruined the country for them.
65,6,You know what I say to you guys :
65,7,"Because we don't get the treatment we want? Yes. We get the prevention, and then we stop putting on the mask because we're not really doing anything wrong. We will never stop using the mask because of the virus and because we don't really have any protections for people that aren't well cured. That's what we do. We don't use it because we can't, I'm just not going to do anything about it. This isn't a joke. It's a dick"
65,12,"The president does not own the health insurance company or the government. The administration does not own any of the health insurance companies or the government. It was just a joke, it was just a joke. I think they are trying to stop the spread of AIDS, but they can't do it."
65,16,I think I will be honest and point out the CDC.
65,26,"Having AIDS - the number one epidemic in America - has no repercussions in other nations or regions. I'm sorry, I don't have the time to look into a proper healthcare system."
65,27,I don't understand why you are being so mad. This is just one of many things. I don't know why you're being so naive and ridiculous.
65,32,"I don't want to tell you something about the whole CDC is trying to stop the spread of AIDS. If you didn't like the government in this, why would it be a problem? Because in that case it's a joke. The CDC does not know about the AIDS epidemic and doesn't understand why it's not a problem."
65,35,CANNOTANSWER - The white house hates the CDC.
65,40,"It is an easy joke, but its a joke. Those people are idiots and not in any way allowing the government to run the country."
65,41,"I read that you mean that you're not a doctor, are you?"
65,44,"This isn't really a joke, but it's a joke in the sense that a joke about the government being out to make the world a better place. It is in fact a joke. This is a joke. I am just saying this."
65,60,"A fucked up joke is a joke, because the CDC is in no way involved in making healthcare, not even to a limited extent, a fucked up joke."
67,65,I think the tyrant's are getting the point across.
75,65,"I would say: ""If I am an American I have no say in the ACA. I just feel like they need to take the time to go through the whole ACA and the ACA is going to become a one-party monopoly that the Obama administration is using as a monopoly."""
78,65,The ACA doesn't address the problem of AIDS. It's a joke because it's intended to address the problem of AIDS. The anti-semitic acts aren't the biggest problems in the US.
81,65,The NSA and the CDC are making a film about it so they can avoid it.
94,65,"That's a very well-rounded statement, and a highly insightful and valid one, and a truly good one."
100,65,"""People with AIDS are having a hard time with sex. It takes a lot of sex to be healthy, and her genitals aren't healthy, yet. I'm still a woman."
65,4,"The CDC's plan to stop HIV in people with the mask has a negative effect on the health care system. If the mask doesn't work, then it has a negative impact on the state and not on the health of the patients. If it doesn't work, then it isn't a positive."
65,6,"If you want to go into public health, you need to go to the CDC and vaccinate your spouse. They have already made this a joke, and that’s all that’s needed in today’s society, and what it does to you is incompetent."
65,7,"Considering how many people in the US have had this type of treatment (e.g., a genital infection with AIDS) the CDC would want to work with people to find a cure."
65,12,"It's not a joke. It's a joke, it's a joke, it's a joke."
65,16,"I'm gonna give a guy a mask and ask him, why is he in a mask? He has to do it!"
65,26,"Yes, it's not racist and a joke. It's a joke and it's not a joke."
65,27,"There's a question here: ""Who should the CDC contact with to find out if someone with AIDS can get a hat? Is that a specific situation that your daughter might have or needs an ACA holder? Are you a CDC representative?"""
65,32,The CDC is an impetus to do the trick and it's being used to keep people from getting sick and the AIDS epidemic isn't a problem.
65,35,"I'm sure a lot of us know that CDC doesn't have the resources to take action, but they are a part of the government, and they do it for good reason."
65,40,I think the only thing that really matters here is that the government is not interested in trying to make people feel better and they are trying to create a worse health situation.
65,41,"I'm a doctor in a hospital. I have a very bad job. I don't know if that's what I want to say, but a good one."
65,44,"""As in there is no real benefit of having a mask and no value to the public at the same time, I have seen the government not stop them from giving it a proper treatment."""
65,60,They are the ones making the joke and they will be the ones making the joke. The one who made it would be a joke and you would not be a joke.

81,65,"There isn't any reason the NSA is making a film about this, unless it's about the AIDS epidemic. I think the movie is about the vaccine. The NSA is using the AIDS vaccine as an excuse to use it."
94,65,"I think the idea of wearing a mask in public is pretty logical, but a bit off, and that’s what I’ve heard."
100,65,"The article also explains how a ""defensive"" diagnosis doesn't have to mean a medical issue."
65,4,This is not an ACA joke. I have a few things to say.
65,6,"What about ""I don't think that's a joke""?"
65,7,"It sounds like you’ve never heard of an ACA, but I’d probably go a little deeper and say, “We’re not going to let this kid go into the CDC because of this. He’s a medical doctor. You can’t do that,” and you have no idea how to think about the idea. I also don’t think a certain type of vaccine is something that needs to be studied."
65,12,"""The CDC doesn't have the power or the authority to make an exception to the ACA."""
65,16,"> People say the ACA is an 'irrational and misleading argument', I’m a doctor - it’s a joke to ask why people are making pranks like this. You’re a joker."
65,26,I think the government should rescind the ACA and start a new school in your county.
65,27,i know what you're trying to say. I have a terrible job.
65,32,Is there an ACA or other health care law?
65,35,And the only reason the CDC isn’t doing anything for the public health is that it’s the first time that it’s been criticized.

67,65,This guy is a tyrant.
75,65,> People are sick of talking to their friends and family about how a mask is helping them get the virus. They want to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS.
78,65,"I have to tell you, though, that he sounds pretty naive. The ACA isn't a joke and it's not a joke. It is a joke because it addresses a problem. The only thing that is a prank that is an important part of our society is our masks."
81,65,The AIDS Vaccination Act and the ACA are two very different things. There is not much to say.
94,65,I think it's better to just wear it when someone is in the midst of an attack than to try to stop them from trying to stop. So it makes sense to me.
100,65,">He told his doctors he wasn’t doing enough, but that his doctors didn’t tell him. It’s one of the most disturbing problems in modern medicine (e.g., treating staph and staph). I want to say that I’m not really sure what the difference between a mask and a sex tape."
65,4,It seems that this was an example of an unrelated comment here. You could argue that the ACA is a joke and that there's nothing wrong with that. But I'd argue that if it were just a joke and people could see the potential for the ACA as a way of bringing people closer to home.
65,6,The reason he is wearing the mask in public is because he is a doctor. He needs to go to the CDC and get vaccinated. He isn't just a prankster.
65,7,"I don't think a person would think it was a joke. But, it isn't a joke."
65,12,"A lot of the jokes in this thread were about the ACA and what the government is trying to do to help the public health. The ACA is a joke to some people, but to others it is a joke to others and a joke to others."
65,16,"It's the ACA, the ACA, the ACA, and the ACA. That's just one example of a joke."
65,26,The Obama administration has to go into details here if they are going to start a new school in your county.

65,44,"I'm a lawyer. I'm a doctor. I've never seen a doctor who doesn't wear a mask. I know the doctor that is on the field, and he's probably working in a school to keep the school from getting pushed to the limit in order to prevent someone with HIV from getting AIDS."
65,60,"I believe it's a joke because the CDC is in no way involved in making healthcare, but they have the power to make it."
67,65,This is an interesting article from the beginning:
75,65,Vaccines are not health issues. Vaccines are not health issues.
78,65,"I see what you mean. It's a joke to put on a mask in order to prevent the spread of AIDS, but the ACA isn't intended to address the problem of the spread of the AIDS epidemic, and the anti-Semitic acts aren't the biggest problems in the US. The ACA is intended to address the problem of AIDS, but a joke to address AIDS and anti-Semitism. The president is trying to make the public sector more important. Vaccines are not health issues."
81,65,So what about a joke?
94,65,"I think it's a good idea to wear a mask in the first place in the first place because you're a private sector, and you're going to get sick. Vaccination is not an official thing."
100,65,"As for him, what he said was to just end this relationship if it’s for him and he’s going to have to go."
65,4,Vaccines are a joke. They are a joke. And a joke is a joke. They are a joke because of the ACA.
65,6,Is this a joke?
65,7,"So, the ACA vs the ACA would make sense?"
65,12,The joke is that he has a doctor and a doctor's assistant. It's not a joke to the school. But a joke to his adolescent son. It's a joke to him.

65,40,I was just reading about this as a joke.
65,41,The school's board decided to vote against the mask because they're not a public health agency. The school also had a similar question. It was considered a red flag.

65,60,"It's funny because you've been able to get a good diagnosis, get tested and then get a medical card. This is why you need a medical card. It's just a joke. It sounds like you just need to get your own doctor to get a med."
67,65,>I'm not against vacks mandates cuz they ruin the economy get people fired and people should be able to choose to wear a mask if they want not by force.
75,65,I'm just a bit concerned that the CDC is able to provide a service that is only used for vaccinations.
78,65,"As I mentioned, it's not a joke, it's a joke. It doesn't address the problem of AIDS and anti-Semitism. The ACA is meant to address the problem of AIDS. HIV/AIDS is not a mental illness, and most people will not be able to cope with the stigma around it."

65,32,"I am a doctor, and I wear a mask for all my sex needs, and I don’t think I could do anything about it. I have been so sick and ill for years, and it makes me feel guilty. AIDS can happen to all people, including me. My mother is not a nurse, but she's a mom, and if I don’t have the health insurance she wouldn’t be able to stay."
65,35,I was a doctor in a medical school in Florida. The CDC was the only agency to address the issue.
65,40,"There's a very large problem here at the top of the subreddit in that the CDC is trying to make money on a bill to protect the health of a population that is vaccinated. Specifically, the ""People want to know what a medical emergency is, because they're not going to be able to have access to the government."" section."
65,41,"The problem isn’t just the stigma, but the stigma attached to it. The CDC is doing nothing to stop the spread of AIDS. It is a joke. It is a joke. The CDC is trying to prevent it, but they don’t want to go about it, because they don’t want to go about it."
65,44,A mask for the specific area of your body and skin lining.
65,60,"I'm very sorry this happened, but this is a really bad joke. You are talking about some people who don't really understand the meaning of a joke, and you have no idea what a joke is. It is one of those things where you put the mask on yourself and ask for a new job."

75,65,"A couple of my colleagues and I got vaccinated before the ACA. We were both vaccinated. The CDC had a lot of authority on that, but we just got our own policies. It was pretty bad for us, and the ACA is just getting the hammer out of us, so they couldn't give us any more. The CDC is in charge. It is the Government. It is the Government."

Vaccination is not a government issue. It is not a government issue. But it is a good idea to wear a mask when a person is attacked. It sounds like a good idea, and a good idea to wear a mask when a person is attacked. It sounds like the CIA has a big deal deal."
100,65,"I'm so sorry you feel this way, but I'm really sorry that you are unable to say that, despite the fact that you are getting such a negative response."
65,4,> Vaccines are a joke. They are a joke.
65,6,That's a shit ton of jokes in this sub.
65,7,"A doctor in Florida, who was vaccinated for AIDS, is talking about a medical malpractice issue and the fact that a vaccine doesn't exist. I also think that a medical malpractice issue would have caused the CDC to be forced to give the student the vaccine. A CDC researcher, who is working on the idea of getting some vaccine for AIDS, has shown that it is likely an effective approach for preventing this issue."
65,12,They have a right to tell the truth. It is not a joke because it is not a joke because it is a joke.

65,16,"Yes, I'm looking for an ACA ad that addresses the issue of AIDS."
65,26,A doctor at my school who wore a mask to protect his student. He asked if the school had a job but not a school for it. He then said he had to pay for his insurance. He said no. And it was for the same reason that he never went to college. I went to a school where people went to see doctors. He was told this was the case because he volunteered. But he also knew there was a job at the school. He had been fired.
65,27,Vaccination is a joke. AIDS is a joke.
65,32,It sounds like this isn't the first time this has been written about.
65,35,No. I don't see that as racist. That's the kind of thing I'm trying to do. You are being racist. I have no problem with you.
65,40,The whole thing is sexist and inappropriate.
65,41,"He's basically trying to say ""Why didn't you have a job and I didn't have a job?"""
65,44,Because the government and its allies aren't putting the CDC on the line to stop the spread of AIDS and promoting a more ethical approach. Those are the people that are in a position of authority. They are all the ones that want to be on the front line. The CDC has a legitimate interest in preventing the spread of the virus.

65,44,A mask to protect a child is a joke...
65,60,There's nothing wrong with wearing a mask to protect the health of the person.
67,65,I've never read the wiki.
75,65,I can’t understand the context but I can still imagine the CDC and govt making a lot of jokes about the ACA and being 'a shit guy'.
78,65,"The idea of a prank, which isn't a joke isn't a joke."
81,65,Why do people put on masks when people are actually wearing hats?
94,65,Vaccination is not a government issue.
100,65,I would probably rather see someone who has a mask and they're talking about a guy who had a difficult time surviving.
65,4,"> I am not interested in the comments, but I can help you figure out if you'd like me to post more comments on this."
65,6,Why don't people think it is a joke and go to the CDC? There's a lot of bad news that the government is getting into trouble for allowing AIDS and getting sick.
65,7,"I wouldn't really have a question. If he wasn't a doctor, they would have been a joke."
65,12,The CDC and CDC are trying to make a joke out of the joke based on what they deem appropriate. I would be very tempted to disagree with you on anything.
65,16,"I'm not sure what the problem is. I don't think the ACA is a joke, and that's just one of many things people have jumped to the realization that it is all about the people. The ACA is a joke. The CDC is putting a medical bill in place that outlines what they need to be vaccinated against. Are you a doctor?"
65,26,"That sarcasm is a thing, so it should not be a joke to talk about AIDS, that is racist."
65,27,I'm a doctor and I do have a job.
65,32,Why is the CDC getting involved in the epidemic?
65,35,"As a physician who lives in Colorado, you're not being racist. I think your comment is overbearing. I think you are misconstruing the whole situation for a joke and making the point that it was a joke."
65,40,This subreddit is filled with shit and it seems like some of these are actually docs.
65,41,Is this the first year of medical school that has a rule of ensuring that the children can not be vaccinated for HIV?
65,44,"It's not a joke, but a joke. The president isn't allowing him to be the worst politician in the world. He's a joke and there's no place for him to make jokes about the government. The President has no obligation to do the right thing."
65,60,"Vaccination is a joke. CDC is not involved in making healthcare, but they are a very powerful agency in the CDC's power in terms of health care."
67,65,"I'm trying to get my mind off of the ACA, and I'm in the middle of a campaign. I think I have a better head on the ACA than any president I know."
75,65,I'd say this is the case because we have the ability to determine when a mandates or if a mandates exist.
78,65,"The idea of a prank, which isn't a joke, isn't a joke. It's a joke because it addresses the problem of AIDS. It is a joke because it addresses the problem of AIDS. The president needs to take up a new job, which has no political agenda."
81,65,"They are trying to take advantage of the spread of AIDS and get people to use the vaccine, because they don't respect human rights."
94,65,"The main point here is that while it's very common to think that a mask and a mask are a good idea, I think the main point is that the idea that it's a good idea that is a bad idea is rather a waste of time and doesn't seem to actually work."
100,65,I think that the first two paragraphs are insufficiently sarcastic. They are all quite vague and misleading.
65,4,What makes this joke even funny?
65,6,Why are you still thinking about the question that this is an inappropriate use of a term to reference in these comments?
65,7,"I am not a doctor and I don't care how much people are putting their life in danger by using a mask, but my parents have always told me to wear a mask and that I wouldn't want to be a sick person. But I agree that there isn't any difference between the two."
65,12,"I don't care what the joke is, I like it and I enjoy it."
65,16,So you're asking why people are making a joke?
65,26,That's a dick move. You have a lot to learn here.
65,27,I'm a dr and I'm an ACA holder.
65,32,I think they're being racist. You need to work with the people who elect you to the White House.
65,35,>The CDC and CDC are trying to make a joke out of the joke
65,40,>The CDC is putting a medical bill in place that outlines what they need to be vaccinated against.
65,41,CDC isn't a joke. They're making a movie about it to keep people from becoming sick and they want people to do the same. They're making a film about it to keep people from being sick.
65,44,I think it is a joke because the president has no moral obligation to do the right thing.
65,60,"That sounds like a bad joke. The CDC isn't involved in making healthcare, but they are in charge of making healthcare."
67,65,"No, they are trying to cut the bill to save lives. And people don't want to fuck up the country, and the government is a tyrant and the tyrants are getting the point across."

81,65,This is a prank.
94,65,"It's not about the government. It's about the healthcare system and how you want to deal with them. It's not a government issue. You're a politician and you need to get vaccinated, not get sick. But your face is a machine, and you don't even know what you are doing. It's a narcissistic and narcissistic notion of what the government should do, or is."
100,65,"I think your definition of ""the disease"" is misleading. The disease is not a mental illness. It is an infectious disease. It is not an infectious disease. It is not a mental illness. There is no cure for HIV. It is not an infectious disease."
65,4,"I can't believe it, but the word joke is an inappropriate word. There is a slur in this article."
65,6,"I don't think anyone will be able to find a way to prove that people have AIDS. It's possible to prove that people aren't on a path to it in America. The CDC isn't part of the public health system, and if anything the government isn't doing anything about it."

65,35,"He's being racist. And this is the real issue, and his job is not a joke."
65,40,It sounds like there is a big problem in the subreddit.
65,41,I've heard the same thing. It is the most serious health issue in my country. I can't imagine the same thing in my country anymore.
65,44,"It's a joke because it is not a joke. A joke because it is a joke. A joke because it is ineffective and doesn't have the resources necessary to do the right thing. ACA is one of the many afaik things that can happen in our country. They aren't as effective as AIDS or any other type of HIV/AIDS, they're just a joke because they're ineffective. I think the joke makes no sense."
65,60,"Because a doctor that has an AIDS infection does not have a mask, he just has a mask on. It’s a joke."
67,65,This is all part of the ACA. There is an increase in people who think they're ill because of the stigma and the risk of them getting sick.
75,65,CANNOTANSWER'S BAD PARTY: Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.It's one of the most interesting things I've heard so far.

65,12,CANNOTANSWER IS A LEGENDARY HUDDEN AND AN EMPTY CAREER
65,16,I think it is a joke. The ACA is a joke. It is a joke because it's being used as a platform to justify the government's own actions.
65,26,Yes. A lot of people have AIDS in their families and they have been in and out of hospitals and hospitals and medical facilities since the 60s.
65,27,CANNOTANSWER'S BAD PARTY: Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
65,32,This is a a prank. What is a prank? That the CDC is doing something illegal with the aid of a mask?
65,35,“This is a joke. It’s a joke. It’s a joke. I don’t think it’s racist. This is a joke. ”
65,40,“You can’t argue that this is a joke. You can’t argue that it’s a joke.”
65,41,What’s the link? I think it was a troll to use a joke to explain something that’s not a joke in the article.
65,44,"Because if you're a doctor, the only way that you would get the vaccine is if you're in a CDC office."
65,60,> The school did not like the mask public health order. I'm sure the other gov't members would be more upset by the mask public health order.
67,65,It is an 'additional' ad that the author of this article explains.
75,65,I'd be surprised if anyone is going to try to be a joke on this.
78,65,This isn't a joke. It's a joke because it addresses the problem of AIDS and anti-Semitism. The ACA is a joke because it addresses the problem of AIDS.
81,65,CANNOTANSWER: a joke?
94,65,"This is not a generalised theory, but the general idea is that some of the most important things you can do, the CIA and the CIA, and the whole notion of the government is based on it."
100,65,Isn't it a mental illness? Because there's some sort of stigma attached to HIV?
65,4,"You're a joke. You're a joke. But your own hiccups are a joke. The idea is there a ""Joke"" and a ""Joke"" that actually does exist. Is the ACA a joke?"

65,7,"he said the student is not getting treatment for AIDS, and is not allowed to go to the hospital."
65,12,I like to tell people that a joke is not a joke.
65,16,It seems like a joke to me.

65,27,>The CDC is using the CDC's AIDS information to prevent the spread of AIDS.

65,40,I'd be surprised if anyone is going to try to be a joke on this. This isn't a joke. It's a joke because it addresses the problem of AIDS. ACA is a joke because it addresses the problem of AIDS.
65,41,CANNOTANSWER: It's a joke because it addresses the problem of AIDS.
65,44,So the CDC is the only one that isn't being funded by the government?
65,60,CANNOTANSWER'S BAD PARTY: Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
67,65,AIDS is a disease and people do not want to deal with it. ''A mask would definitely help keep the problem from getting worse''
75,65,"CDC is a party to the ACA. Those things are going to be used to undermine the administration, causing the ACA to resurface in a lot of ways."
78,65,I was a child and it was like the joke was funny. Obviously that was the joke because the president was supposed to address the issue of HIV/AIDS. I don't care for the joke but the joke is probably just a prank because the president does not see a joke or any serious question.
81,65,CANNOTANSWER: ''There's a guy who's trying to make a fake mask for a prank while he's on the bus.

65,12,I don't like that a lot of people on this sub think that a joke is not a joke. I think the joke is a joke because it addresses the problem of AIDS.

65,44,Then CDC can say the thing they do and make it a prank.

AIDS is not an infectious disease, and most people won't be able to cope with the stigma around it. I think this is one of the most important things for this country."
81,65,CANNOTANSWER: I think that the whole idea of wearing a mask is sexist and inappropriate. The NSA and the CDC are making a film about it so they can avoid it.
94,65,You sound like a pathetic and illogical person. That's why the media is able to go against the best evidence for anything that is going on in the US.
100,65,A dick. A dick. A dick. Unless you say the word dick or the word dick you are sarcastic.

65,60,It is a joke. It's a joke.
67,65,The article claims that the president is not able to take action to stop the ACA.
75,65,You don't really want to go to a party or a party without being vaccinated. You want to go to a party or a party that doesn't have any mandates for a vaccination?
78,65,CANNOTANSWER:

65,16,This is a ridiculous example of a 'joke'. You just can't say what it is.
65,26,"CANNOTANSWER is a doctor who was in the position of the ""joke"" section of a medical school. I’m not saying that this is a good thing, but I’ve never heard of any school that isn’t going to do something about it, so I’m not really sure what’s being discussed."
65,27,I'm not trying to be a sarcastic douchebag but I'm not sure how you're going to feel about this.
65,32,"I'm a lawyer, I work with the CDC. They are making a film about the AIDS epidemic."
65,35,Are you being a bit racist? Because if I was the only person who wanted a mask...
65,40,"""Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.A dick. A dick. Unless you say the word dick or the word dick you are sarcastic."""
65,41,">I'm not a doctor and I'm a doctor in a hospital. I have a very bad job. I don't even have a helmet. So, I can't wear a mask."
65,44,"""A mask is a mask. A mask for a specific area of your body, like your neck and a certain amount of skin lining. It's for the specific area of your body, like your neck and a certain amount of skin lining."""
65,60,It's the same as the ACA. That's the whole point of this post.
67,65,The article states that the president is not able to take action to stop the ACA. It seems like the article states that the president is not able to take action to stop the ACA. The article states that the president is not able to take action to stop the ACA.
75,65,"... the government isn't trying to make the country work. It's not a good idea, because people who are really trying to stop the spread of a virus don't want to go to a party that doesn't have mandates."
78,65,CANNOTANSWER is the author of the book.
81,65,That's a great one. The CDC is not really the only agency that is making a prank about it. This is only part of a joke.
94,65,"Because it works, and it is not an idea for the people."
100,65,"He is the one who is trying to convince people that a mask will not keep them from having sex, or help others with the problem, or help people who don't have HIV. Ultimately, he has a serious health problem that is more about himself than it is about others."
65,4,"CANNOTANSWER is a doctor who was in the position of the ""joke"" section of a medical school."
65,6,"People with HIV are not at risk. A mask is just a joke. Despite the obvious claims that the CDC is involved, there is still a lot of bad news that they aren't going to do something about the ACA. I don't think it's an inappropriate joke. It's a joke. The only joke I can think of that argues against is the fact that they aren't doing anything about it."
65,7,"I'd like to point out that ""The joke is not a joke. It is a joke. It is a joke."
65,12,Isn't it ridiculous he's talking about the ACA and other laws which are being revoked? Or does the ACA make a joke?
65,16,You're probably reading a lot of that and you don't have to ask why people are making the ACA a joke.
65,26,The school would be going to the president to tell him that.
65,27,"AIDS isn't a joke, it's a joke."
65,32,I just came here to say the same thing. This is very much a joke.
65,35,"As long as it doesn’t come off as a joke, I don’t see a problem with sexist and racist jokes being jokes."
65,40,I read the title in a guise of sarcasm.
65,41,"What can I do for you? If I’m not feeling well enough today, can I get my hair removed for the first time in three years?"
65,44,So what about a prank about the CDC?
65,60,"Yes, he is making a joke, a joke about not getting enough money in school, a joke about making the CDC do their job in America because it makes a joke, a joke about being able to get sick, a joke about people who don't know what they're doing, a joke about people who don't know what they're doing, a joke about a joke about the health problem, a joke about people who have an issue with the government, and a joke about a joke about the CDC doing something that might help"
67,65,The article states that the president is not able to take action to stop the ACA.
75,65,"No, the ACA does not contain all the mandates, but it does contain the requirements. Those are if you have the funding to make it, if you do not have the funds to do it, and you don't have the funding to make it."
78,65,CANNOTANSWER was in the ACA as a doctor and got the joke. he is a prankster
81,65,The issue is that this is a prank. They are trying to use it to prevent the spread of AIDS/tasters. It's a joke. It's not a joke.
94,65,You want to be the government agent? You want to be a political representative.
100,65,"I am not being sarcastic, but I am being sarcastic."
