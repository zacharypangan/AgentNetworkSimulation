53,16,how does the mask make his breath come out of the back of his head
56,53,says the woman that wears the mask to protect herself lmao well dear the gun works the mask doesn t
59,53,oh man you should come to georgia it s like people here think wearing a mask gives them covid there s so few
63,53,putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i ve ever done in my entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things
80,53,i m not against vacks mandates cuz i don t think i ll catch the cough i already had it i m against them cuz they ruin the economy get people fired and people should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force
84,53,i love coaching however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops
85,53,oh man you should come to georgia it s like people here think wearing a mask gives them covid there s so few
53,4,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.How does the mask make his breath come out of the back of his head
53,16,The problem with your state is the lack of a proper mask.
56,53,"i think the whole article is an attempt to defend a government mandate, which is absurdly demeaning"
59,53,"I'm sorry, but your comment is in response to my recent post."
63,53,>If one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops
80,53,"I don't know what you mean by 'unfortunate', but I think a lot of this is going to change, and some people just don't agree with it."
84,53,I have some friends from high school who would go to college wearing a mask for their teammates to help prevent the spread of a virus.
85,53,And that's when you get infected with a virus
53,4,"OP, you say the government is trying to protect your breath, and what you see is not a good idea."
53,16,A mask isn't something a man should wear in his head. It's a protective covering. Wearing it under a helmet makes it easier to catch the virus.
56,53,"... So your name screams ""Lmao, dear the gun works the gun doesnt""? Is this a thing?"
59,53,"I’m a spokesman for the state of Georgia. I wear a mask to get vaccinated. I agree with you, putting on a mask gives them covid there s so few oh man you should come to Georgia."
63,53,"I've done a lot of dumb things with my mask. I've done a lot of dumb things with it and it's been a huge sneeze after it. I'm really a little bit sad that I got a full mask. I want my players to get in the game, so I'm not wearing anything else besides my helmet. I'm a football coach. I think that's one of the reasons I play football. I was just a student. I did a lot of dumb things like wearing my helmet and my helmet."
80,53,"Wearing a mask or getting the jab is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. I don't know what you mean by 'unfortunate', but I think a lot of this is going to change, and some people just don't agree with it."
84,53,I'm sorry but I think you have to keep your head down. You should do what you can. I'd be in tears just thinking of you.
85,53,I read the first two paragraphs of your post. You sound like a shady guy.
53,4,"OP, you say the government is trying to protect your breath, and what you see is not a good idea."
53,16,He is a shady guy.
56,53,"IANAL, but i know that in the UK I've never seen an article on a guy wearing a mask that gets a sneeze and gets a jab. Especially since he wears the mask a lot."
59,53,"I've heard a lot about these nitpicks in the past, but I don't remember what the ""advice"" was."
63,53,I love to put on my mask as well and it helps me see the point of my mask.
80,53,"... and in case there isn't a lot of this here, the issue is not that you are not a legitimate citizen, but that the government is not supposed to do anything. This is a state-wide issue, but a federal law isn't enough for it."
84,53,"I was one of my best coaches in college, and was asked to give a presentation on this one because he thought there was a problem with the national guard rules. I would wear my mask every game I had. I'm not gonna resign."
85,53,"I don't think the article is accurate at all, I think it's a very poor interpretation of the post. I think the author was trying to imply that the state is not allowed to have the disease control program, so they should try to make it very clear."
53,4,> if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops
53,16,"So if you wear a mask and get a sneeze, isn't it worth putting a mask on?"
56,53,It's possible they were trying to help his health and he wasn't a good at it.
59,53,You guys have been getting too blatantly repressed.
63,53,I think the only thing that makes sense is that if they had to wear a mask and had a syringe and helmets on that day I'd be pretty fucking crazed.
80,53,"I have no idea if you're saying that, but the truth is, the government doesn't have to enforce anti-virus laws."
84,53,"CANNOTANSWER: ""This is a pretty simple example of a government effort to stop the spread of a virus. The only thing that keeps me awake when I go to sleep is when I don't have enough energy to run around."
85,53,I'm not a shady guy but I'm a bit agnostic. I'm not sure what to say about your post.
53,4,I'm assuming he meant that the national guard isn't allowed to enforce anti-virus laws?
53,16,"I've got to say I'm glad the government has not removed the ""unfortunate"" part, because it's not going to change. But you also need to be careful that your head is not in a position to absorb any potential harmful substances from your mouth - such as coughs or sneezes."
56,53,Is it because he's a sneeze and a jab?
59,53,"""The first person comments on the video are based on my knowledge of how the government is doing things in our country. What he's saying is... I don't think he can get vaccinated for HIV (because the government isn't going to fix it)"
63,53,I'd have to read the whole thing if I was an athlete.
80,53,I read a few sentences about the government's role in the government. They are very ineffective.
84,53,"It's not a political issue, and it's not a political issue at all. I mean if you want to change the rules for a team, and if they haven't, don't. This is not a presidential issue at all, but it's not something that the media is ever going to be about."
85,53,I think I'm a bit agnostic. I'm only in the states and I don't know if I can keep up with it.

56,53,"I'm sorry to say it's been a while since I've been here, but I think it's time to move on."
59,53,"There is nothing we can do to fix the problem and we have no solution. If you go to the emergency room, it will be all over. The first couple days will be the hardest."
63,53,I didn't see a comment about the mask but I am not familiar with how it is used - I am talking about the head mask and a very common use.
80,53,So you said he was a fag.
84,53,I don't think there's enough information available to me about this.
85,53,Is there an ACA for that? Is it possible for the president to wear a mask?
53,4,I was in the medical field for 5 years.
53,16,"... that's not my position, the CDC, the government and the media don't have any information to go on with it. 'I'm not sure what to say about your post. I'm only in the states and I don't know if I can keep up with it."
56,53,"I thought you meant ""I'm the guy that thinks he's a dick and a sneeze and a jab."""
59,53,"IANAL. I'm a huge fan of people who believe in masks in Australia. And I'm pretty sure they've seen a lot of them. This is about the health care system. A person that wants to work, be forced to participate in work, etc. and then become an active member of the society, have a right to a job, not just to the government, and who should work. The only thing I really do is vote for someone who wants to work."
63,53,It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
80,53,"I think it's pretty obvious to be a fan of the government. The government is not trying to prevent the spread of AIDS. It's a crime for the NSA to impose a law that identifies as ""fag"" and also the government has no legitimate interest in preventing it."
84,53,I really think he means they're trying to try to get out the virus by 'putting them on a mask' :/ oh and then he has AIDS.
85,53,I want to see if I have a chance in this world to actually make a big statement to that effect.
53,4,I'm not sure if this is a real problem here but it's not an issue that the NSA doesn't have a legitimate interest in preventing.
53,16,The media is not trying to do anything about it. I'm trying to be more of a non-partisan. But I really don't think there's any real opportunity for the media to do anything about it. It would be a better idea for the NSA to do something about it to bring attention to the AIDS/HIV epidemic than to let the press try to hide it from the media.
56,53,"""Well dear the gun works the gun doesn't"""
59,53,"A mask – and a few other things – are part of the CIA, FDA, FDA and CDC's treatment of people with HIV. It's very important to know that the mask is against the CDC's protocols and does not prevent them from becoming vaccinated for the disease. It is an important part of how health care is done. That's why it's so important to know that the masks are used."
63,53,There is a lot of confusion in that sub and you're right. I don't know what to say.
80,53,"It is absolutely illegal. It is not illegal. It is not illegal. It is not illegal. But it is a crime. It is illegal. It is not illegal. It is illegal. The government is acting to protect the public, but it isn't going to stop the spreading of AIDS. I'm sorry, but I'm sorry that he isn't even going to be a presidential candidate."
84,53,What a dick move. I think the president needs to resign. I would hate to hear about someone that does this to my team. The president needs to show his disrespect to his staff. I would not want to be my coach. I would make the team do it because they have a problem with the National Guard defending players who don't wear masks to fight a virus that has already spread. I'd be scared that the other team won't recognize my name. I don't think we are all in a big deal about a man who is a guy
85,53,"Well, the ACA doesn't include HIV and it is a really stupid thing to wear, especially since there is a huge omission in their health care policy. That's not how the virus gets spread in the US. I mean if they're talking about vaccinating the US and giving them more of the options than the ACA does he have to be more hesitant to do so?"

56,53,I think the government is a clone.
59,53,So... the president wants to get sick with a mask to protect his kids?
63,53,"I think you need to ask yourself this: ""Dad, I need a I'm not sure how many people in the US actually wear masks, just that they don't know much about the system and the facts. They're just trying to push the issue aside, but if I were to say I'd have done it all the time, would I."""
80,53,"I’m sorry, but I’m sorry that he isn’t even going to be a presidential candidate."
84,53,"CANNOTANSWER: ""We wear masks to fight the flu. I don't care who the title is, I think you know the issue."""
85,53,So we're thinking of this: Vaccination is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
53,4,"'The first person comments on the video are based on my knowledge of how the government is doing things in our country. What he means is...

53,16,Is he getting a vaccine?
56,53,"The ACA does not exist because it is an evil ideology. If Obama weren't a tyrant, we would be a terrible country for our nation."
59,53,"A friend of mine did. He thought he had seen his brother, and wanted to take him to a public hospital to get vaccinated. He had seen an ape and said it was an awful infection. He thought the ape was a good guy and the government deserved better. Then when he turned his back on him he told me he needed to go to the hospital and have a treatment with his family and the police. He was really confused by the whole NSA and the CIA thing."
63,53,A prank. Especially when it comes to using a mask that's ineffective and that's not in a proper way. You're in a prank.
80,53,...The whole point of it all is to stop the spread of a virus.
84,53,>CannoTANSWER:
85,53,You're probably the one who got the idea. He wants you to get a mask.
53,4,>Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
53,16,The CIA has said that a person who doesn't wear a mask to fight an AIDS infection will likely have a greater chance of getting AIDS than a person who doesn't wear a mask.
56,53,"> the ACA does not exist because it is an evil ideology. If Obama weren't a tyrant, we would be a terrible country for our nation."
59,53,The title is misleading as well as misleading.
63,53,"It's called ""I've done a lot of dumb things with my mask. I've done a lot of dumb things with my mask and it's been a huge sneeze after it. I'm really a little bit sad that I got a full mask.

I don't see why they're doing anything wrong, and just don't want to see how it's gonna make the entire conversation much worse."
84,53,"Is it possible that Obama was wrong that the only thing that kept me awake when I go to sleep is when I don't have enough energy to run around? """
85,53,"It was a petty joke. It was a good movie, and I was about to say a lot:"
53,4,They're talking about a lot of the other things.
53,16,"As a person who grew up in a country where HIV/AIDS is a rare disease, you'd think if you were to have an actual infection you wouldn't be so bad in this era."

56,53,"The ACA is not an evil ideology. It is a nonsense. If the president had acted like that, he would have made it into the constitution."
59,53,"I don't know if it's a joke but the title is misleading and misleading. Vaccines are not the right way to stop the spread of a disease. They're a way of fighting it. The fact that you can't find a doctor in time for work, and you don't have to visit the doctor is irrelevant."
63,53,Is there a definite answer? I can't even think of any.
80,53,I have never been asked to speak like that on a regular basis. I just don't understand how this is happening to this country.
84,53,"The best part is that all of this is the worst in the history of the world, and it's a very good thing the president's got the support of the people who are vilifying him for it. This makes a lot of sense."
85,53,I'd like to point out that the president is very petty and misogynistic and uncooperative. He should put on a mask and get vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
53,4,"CANNOTANSWER: ""We wear masks to fight the flu. I don't care who the title is, I think you know the issue."""

It is a nonsense. If the president had acted like that, he would have made it into the constitution."
59,53,You don't have to go to the doctor. It's a ridiculous and inaccurate statement. The government's work has nothing to do with what it does.
63,53,I feel bad for the NSA. They're being such a shitty thing. There's a lot of misinformation in this sub. And it's still very confusing.
80,53,"The NSA is not a government agency, it is a government."
84,53,"Nope. I'm the president of the country, and it's not a presidential issue at all."
85,53,"People in Georgia are just getting sick and a mask, and it's more of a symptom of a lot of opportunistic policies. This is the only country I've heard of where someone who has a virus could have a mask on."
53,4,"The fact that there is no vaccine is indicative of what is happening. There are ways that could be used to prevent it, and this does not sound like a practical solution to the problem."
53,16,"The CDC, the government, and the media are just trying to cover their noses with their eyes."
56,53,I'm very much into this topic and I'm more into the ACA because of the fact that the government is supposedly trying to prevent the spread of AIDS.
59,53,I think people should realize that their opinions on this article are incorrect. This is how it is written.
63,53,This is why you have to wear your helmet. A mask is a joke. You should wear it. You should wear it.
80,53,What is not a government agency?

56,53,...And the other part of it I find to be funny is that you are quoting a prank. I’m pretty sure this was the NSA claiming to be part of a joke.

63,53,'Twas one of the dumbest things things I've ever done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things with my mask'.
80,53,The President is actually making a statement about this to the NSA.
84,53,"He also said that he wanted to stop the spread of AIDS because he saw that there was a problem with the national guard rules. The president could have just sat on his helmet for the whole time and said, ""We don't know how to stop the epidemic."""

63,53,"This is a movie about the NSA. I'm sure you have read it before, but what you're talking about is a joke and it's a good example of a joke and not a real one."

80,53,I've come across an article of a very serious nature about it:
84,53,I don't think any of those phrases make sense at all. It seems to me that people get all sorts of ridiculous and disgusting comments. Like that's just not true. This is a prank. The president can't seem to change the rules because they are a part of the team.
85,53,">People wearing a mask to'stop' HIV are very dangerous, and the people wearing it don't actually know how to walk because they think it's bad."

63,53,I'm not trying to put into words a specific part of the title to be clear. Is this the kind of joke that would be used in the NFL?
80,53,"the NSA is a scumbag, but not illegal to do anything illegal. It isn't illegal to enforce anti-virus laws, it isn't illegal to use one. The point of it all is to stop the spread of a virus. The NSA is the government."

There's a reason they don't have a helmet, and they're going to run for it, he's not even an official"

85,53,I had to make it through. I was so disappointed I couldn't read a sentence.
53,4,The NSA is not involved with the ACA. They are promoting the disease and are trying to stop the spread of AIDS.
53,16,>The first part of the article isn't misleading. I’m pretty sure this was the NSA claiming to be part of a joke.
56,53,So how is the article spelled in the name of the president?
59,53,"Vaccines are not necessary to stop the spread of the disease. The issue with the ACA is the lack of a proper protection. ""I'm not sure what I think is a good idea. The whole point of the article is that it's not a joke."
63,53,I'd be very fucking pissed if someone would ask me to wear a mask for a joke. I think that's a fair question.
80,53,I'm going to do this. I'm going to tell you something. I'm going to have to give you a chance.
84,53,"It's a really good idea. The president needs to be forced to take up a new job, which has no political agenda. It's not a prank, but it's one that can be considered a political issue."
85,53,"I'm just trying to get you to read what the fuck you're telling me. If you can't, you don't have a choice."
53,4,"In that context, we need to be careful with the way we choose to interpret this question."

56,53,"As far as I can tell, there's no prank or prank claiming on the article, and they're pretty much just pranks. So they're not pranks. They're pranks. If Obama had had acted like that, he would have made it into the constitution."
59,53,I would call the joke a satire because of the absurdity and general premise of the article. I'm also a huge fan of a lot of people who believe in the masks. Mostly because they are just so... sarcastic & misleading. I would call it a satire because of the way the article is written.
63,53,"The movie isn't about the mask, but the movie is about people putting on masks to eat some nuts that were euthanized by their peers. The syringes can be worn to stop a virus, but they can't go back to the syringes."
80,53,I've written all of these and all of the shady parts of the NSFW post:
84,53,Vaccination is not an effective prank.
85,53,"Yes, he should wear a mask."

53,16,"No one cares if he's getting a vaccine or not, and he's the one doing it, no matter the name of the sneeze mask."
56,53,"I mean, I just think it's just a prank."

85,53,There is a lot of things that the Obama administration does to prevent the spread of HIV in the US. The administration is not exactly making a joke. The ACA repeal has essentially been a joke.
