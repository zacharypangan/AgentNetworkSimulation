44,27,You're probably on to something here
45,44,I think a little of this guy is saying he won't go to another event if he has to wear his mask if he doesn't wear his helmet
47,44,Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of a virus. Please wear masks.
52,44,i love coaching however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops
65,44,If they would have passed a mandate to not be the most effective in the country it wouldn't have happened if they were on the ballot.
72,44,"a mask has to be on when you can walk through a restaraunt, as if you need to be able to do that."
75,44,[Given the amount of people using this website (or shaming the government for their policies) it hasn't worked out yet:
77,44,I can imagine this was a bit of a fucking thing to say...
80,44,I think the government should be allowing those employees to do this. They are not willing to put people on health insurance that can't be protected from HIV
81,44,I would tell someone about it.
82,44,Does it matter what it makes you?
84,44,They can't even wear a helmet. It's not as simple as wearing a mask.
86,44,I read that the first time he took off his mask he walked ten feet in an unsafe environment and was not allowed to enter. He refused to leave it he did it with the intention of getting his foot stuck on his back.
88,44,"If you were being vaccinated, and you were being vaccinated, you would need a mask that is on a mask, not a mask that says you will not get sick from that vaccine. That way you can't be fucked by any events without one."
89,44,I don't know where to start if I've done all the dumb things but I do know how to get there
93,44,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
44,27,"I don't think this is what you said. We need a government that is capable of taking a vaccine and protecting people from HIV, and not the federal government."
45,44,Why the fuck does the government have to take care of your own safety?
47,44,"This is one of those pranks that people are trying to keep the government from doing. I don't think the government should be trying to do something like this, but its good for the country."
52,44,"I'm sure this was a joke, but it was a remark from someone else based on some old Facebook thread that is being shared."
65,44,"The government's policies have been in place since 1997, so they would have been on the ballot."
72,44,> I'm not against vacks mandates cuz they ruin the economy get people fired and people should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force
75,44,I was vaccinated for 10 months and a bit of a flu - I stayed out of work for 2 years and then went to TwitchCon to get a vaccination. This is a massive mistake.
77,44,It was actually a good point that was taken out by the author of the wiki article. The other quote echoes the point I made and is not just a response to the article itself.
80,44,Why are these mandates in the US? Are they in the US? Or is it the US? Are there any regulations to prevent this? I'd think that a mask is a way to prevent it from spreading in the US.
81,44,I am not a lawmaker. I was a lawmaker and I have to tell someone I am a lawmaker.
82,44,You have no idea what is in the title.
84,44,"""We'll resign and not coach until this nonsense stops. I am very sorry but you have to play with the same team and you are also not required to wear a helmet. I am gonna tell you the truth, in my case I just do not wear a helmet, and not a helmet, so I will be a new coach. I am gonna teach my new coach how to deal with this nonsense. Is this a thing? A good mask. I am sure I will be wearing it for a week.."
86,44,"I am a person of word covid and a very good friend of the author of ""Section 10 of the Law of Medicine"""
88,44,I think the CDC is overreacting here because of the fact that they are the only ones that think they need to cover up the problem and if you want to do it they can do so.
89,44,Wearing a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i have done in my entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i ve done in my entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask
93,44,"Yes. The government has done much good, and even the ACA, albeit in the way that it is proposed to us."
44,27,"I think we need a government that is capable of taking a vaccine and protecting people from HIV, and not the federal government."
45,44,"I know what they're doing, and I'm going to have to say a bit more about the mask problem."
47,44,"This is actually not a prank on the government. You are implying that you are wearing a mask for the fear of getting vaccinated, which is very inappropriate."
52,44,"In the future I'd be resigned from all the public health roles, but I'm gonna keep my mouth shut and let myself get a full suit and tie."
65,44,a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
72,44,I think this is very egregious to me.
75,44,I don't think people think that the government is going to be able to prevent spread of a virus.
77,44,"No, the point of the article is to be of any help in making sure the government doesn't have to worry about the spread of the virus."
80,44,"If you can't wear a mask, you're a scumbag."
81,44,IANAL. Just re read what you wrote.
82,44,"That's a big problem in this country. We need to protect ourselves. It's not a solution to this problem. I know the situation is a lot worse than it is here, but it isn't happening now."
84,44,"I was told by an old guy I knew. I had never heard of him wearing masks in a public position, and he was in the National Guard, so I was told that this nonsense would be taken seriously. He was right and he could not be trusted to do his job. He got the memo to stop wearing masks when he fucked up. The rumour was, that the government was going to start a federal war on viruses by changing the rules in my school and taking it away from the guys who were sick. Then I had my head down and I just got"
86,44,"Yes, but the government is still trying to give a lot of time to educate people."

93,44,I'm not sure why people get in trouble for wanting to wear a mask. That was an idea that started by conservatives in the 70's who had no interest in the healthcare.
44,27,"It's not a big problem. It's a very serious problem. The government is trying to make a better public health system that is insufficient in protecting our health and health. We need a government that is capable of taking a vaccine and protecting people from HIV, and not the federal government."
45,44,Why are people in the military and at sports events like hockey or soccer not wearing a mask?
47,44,You're referring to the part of the article where he is wearing a mask to bring the government's message to the police to stop the spread of a virus.
52,44,A ninja in the national guard vowed to avoid wearing a mask.
65,44,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
72,44,/u/pww1ewdjsybnozbd? They are so wrong. They should be made to go back to their homes.
75,44,It seems like they're promoting falsehoods to support the government's attempts to get the government involved and to stop them.
77,44,A virus flies when the virus spreads over the whole country and people who haven't had boosters can't think about it in the moment.
80,44,"It's not sexist. You can't even afford a mask that prevents you from contracting a disease, and if you do not know why it is there, the government is not going to do anything about it. You can't just buy a mask for the purpose of preventing the spread of a virus, but you can buy one for someone else."
81,44,"Having a mask is one thing, but not wearing a mask in public will help the virus spread."
82,44,We need a mask for someone with a CDC report
84,44,"[I don't care who the title is, I think you know the issue. It's the only thing I can think of that should be said. I'm sick, sick, and can't change the rules."
86,44,I think it's the very least of a lot to ignore all of this.
88,44,If I were the owner of the CDC's vaccine coverage I would not need the mask. I would be the only one to have that.
89,44,There is no slang term for it. It's a joke. It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. He was fucking the restaraunt Putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i've done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask
93,44,>The government isn't opportunistic and the government doesn't want to do anything that could help stop the spread of HIV/AIDS.
44,27,> Because they're promoting falsehoods to support the government's attempts to get the government involved and to stop them.
45,44,"I don't know if there's actually a reason for that, but this rumor is a bit out there."
47,44,OP is not a lawyer. He's not a lawyer. Is he supposed to be a politician?
52,44,It's all very reasonable to assume that people don't recognize the risks in the face of the threat of a disease.
65,44,>This is the biggest problem I've encountered in public health situations. The CDC is the only public health agency in the nation that provides protection for people who do not wear a mask. That means the state doesn't have to do anything about it.
72,44,"Apparently this is a joke. The one I've been looking up for months: [[http://www.thessfw.com/wiki/Washington/Wash_Us_Flash_Us_Hair.jpg)(http://www.ssfw.gov/resources/Hash/Mash_Us_H The article mentions that this is an issue not in itself, but in fact that the government is actually attempting to stop the spread of the virus. [[[[http://www.ssfw.gov"
75,44,You said you wouldn't have a vaccine. I'm not going to be able to afford a mask at the moment.
77,44,"A virus is very contagious. In fact, people who get vaccinated for it can still get the flu. So it's really only a little bit wrong, but the whole article says that the people wearing a mask are probably still sick, and it's not safe to tell if they were vaccinated. This is a common thing. So a mask is a must."
80,44,/r/AmericanAgePerson.html
81,44,I think the way you're interpreting this is completely depressing.
82,44,"I re-read your post and thought you are the one with the video and the fact that you are the one with the video and the fact that you are the one with the video. Is there a specific rule about you wearing a mask, Is there a particular rule about you wearing a mask? It's a question to ask the government. It's an interesting question, and if you are really looking for a solution, it will require some thought. I don't think you are the one who was wrong in the ACA. Is there a"
84,44,I'm sorry if it isn't funny.
86,44,It's an example of a lack of proper protection. It's one of the dumbest things you've done in your entire life.
88,44,"Is this something that the person in this sub are being extremely rude. Vaccines are not the right, you should not have to do it. The actual problem is how many people wear masks, and when it happens, they die. Getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks."
89,44,"I think that the sarcastic joke is a good point, because people like to wear masks. People like to wear masks all the time."
93,44,The President is a tyrant.
44,27,OP is the one who started it. OP said that the CDC is the only public health agency in the nation that provides protection for people who do not wear a mask. They don't really have any information on the CDC or any other government agency.
45,44,"I don't get why people say things like that, but it is so funny. It makes me very happy because I'm sure a lot of people - including myself - have no idea what the joke is about."
47,44,"I mean, he doesn't have to wear a mask to protect himself against an illness, but he does want to protect his wife and children from getting vaccinated. And they eat their own food because it is cheap and easy to do."
52,44,> We need to move on. We’ll get better.
65,44,"If the school is not addressing this, it doesn't matter....it's a prank."
72,44,"""I'm not against the government. They are going to take a very very dangerous approach to the SARS virus epidemic."
75,44,if the CDC does that they will be looking into it.
77,44,"Honestly, that's an awful lot of the right thing to do."
80,44,>I'm not against vacks mandates cuz they ruin the economy get people fired and people should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force.
81,44,"And when a woman starts using an anti-virus mask and they don't know how to stop it, that person will get a real life virus attack."
82,44,"The issue here isn't about the mask, but it's about the ACA."
84,44,"The national guard is putting too much pressure on their people. The government is putting too much pressure on them. I am sure they don't know. They're trying to stop the virus from spreading. The whole ""he's wearing a mask because of illness and you don't have to stay active and you're going to die of this illness."" thing is a big red flag. It's not a political issue, and it's not. The government is trying to stop this from happening, but it's not. They're trying to stop the virus from spreading."
86,44,>We're looking at you like a bunch of twats in a car on the hoodie. You can't do the things you do when you don't want to. I've also heard a lot about people who would have the problem of being killed It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
88,44,"The CDC and people are being really nice and understanding, but they are just making fun of people. They have a problem in trying to do it as well. They don't seem to know how to do it, and they may not know how to do it, but they are trying to try and make their point across."
89,44,That is my favorite movie of all time. I'm so excited about this movie.
93,44,I've tried a few times to stab someone with a pen.
44,27,This guy is a prick. They're making fun of us.
45,44,"So, you have to put on a mask and you don't wear a mask, just a mask. It's the best way to smuggle up the cold."
47,44,"This guy carries a CDC mask. It's a government program for public health. The government is causing a surge of people to die from AIDS. So in a nutshell, the government is causing this and making a real mess."
52,44,"I can't believe the ACA tries to prevent HIV spread. I don't want to be able to get rid of it, but I can't see it in that state."
65,44,Those are some of the most important things I've encountered in public health situations. The CDC is the only public health agency in the nation that provides protection for people who do not wear a mask. That means the state doesn't have to do anything about it.
72,44,It's all pretty cheesy. But it seems like they're doing something wrong.
75,44,"The CDC isn't involved, it's trying to censor it."
77,44,">The President's mask would be just as dangerous as his hands. He'd be wearing his mask to show some rage to the people, but would then be able to stand up for himself. So that's why I'm an anti-HIV/AIDS supporter. This ACA is an anti-Semitic act which is a real thing to get passed in Congress, and is used to stop the spread of HIV."
80,44,"So I'm saying ""No NSA, but i think they should be doing nothing."""
81,44,>The people who pushed for the ACA are actually opposed to it?
82,44,CANNOTANSWER: The ACA prohibits a large number of people from wearing a mask. That's just a big piece of the puzzle. I'm a huge fan of people who believe in masks in Australia. The people who pushed for the ACA are the ones who made it illegal.
84,44,>I think it's hard to explain why this isn't the main issue with people with AIDS.
86,44,What kind of people believe that a person wearing a mask is the problem? Do you have a theory to make that conclusion?
88,44,"I'm not sure if you've seen the movie. I know you're saying something like ""if I were the owner of the CDC's vaccine coverage I would not need the mask. I would be the only one to have that."" But you're also not making fun of the vaccine. I know there's not a lot of people who have vaccinated themselves. But you're being really rude, and not just using the phrase ""they aren't really vaccinated. They seem to have a problem"" or ""I don't think it'"
89,44,"It's a comedy movie, and it has such great ideas. It's a great movie."
93,44,People are going to have to go through another crisis or they'll go through a depression. People are going to have to go through another crisis or they'll go through a depressed period. People who pushed for it are the ones who made it illegal.
44,27,"""Was this a big problem?"""
45,44,That's the joke. It's not really a joke. It's just a joke. It's not that funny. It's funny.
47,44,"We have an ACA that essentially stops the spread of a virus, and you can get a vaccine for any disease."
52,44,"The ACA is the answer. It has been passed for years, with no substantive effects."
65,44,"A mask is not a dick when someone is harmed by HIV. There's a reason it is not a mask, and that's only because someone can be infected. It's a mask that's made to be worn by people who don't care about their health. It's a mask that's made to be worn by people who don't care about their health. It's a mask. It's for the specific area of your body, like your neck and a certain amount of skin lining."
72,44,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.What is this? ""Oops, I saw the hysteria and I don't understand why people think this is a joke""."
75,44,People who are not vaccinated are not supposed to take steps to prevent HIV from spreading or to prevent it from spreading. There are a number of different ways to stop HIV.
77,44,>I was given an idea as an idea to use as a tool to prevent the spread of HIV infections by using a mask and the people here wanted it to be used to keep people from stealing it.
80,44,I like the NSA is trying to keep the government's role in the public health system from being disrupted.
81,44,"The ""whole issue is not a joke, but a joke."" What is it about, ""It's only a joke because I have no idea what the ACA is""?"
82,44,"CANNOTANSWER says ""We need a mask for someone with a CDC report."""
84,44,"It sounds like they're trying to talk about the virus. It's all about the mask. It's for a specific area, like the neck. Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks."
86,44,"i don't know, i mean what about a person who says they put on a mask?"
88,44,"You sound really rude, don't you? It's not funny, but you sound like you have a great point, it's just a part of your post."
89,44,I don't think it's just a sarcastic joke. I have a hard time believing that anyone really thinks the whole thing is a joke.
93,44,"We are not against vacks mandates because we are not in favor of the ACA, but because the government does not want to do anything that is supposed to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS."
44,27,I am not a lawyer. I am a doctor. I am a public health worker. I am not a private health care professional. I am not a doctor. The government isn't helping people if they don't need a vaccine or have a mental health condition. I am not a lawyer. I am not an attorney.
45,44,"He was talking about the fact that a mask in the movie made people sick, it's part of the reason that many people are naive and racist about the idea of a mask."
47,44,I'd bet the President would have a bad time doing it with his mask on.
52,44,"The article isn't ""about the ACA"" it's about the US government's position on preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS. It was about how it's an ongoing problem that is now involving everyone who is responsible for the HIV epidemic."
65,44,The mask is actually part of the measures deployed by the CDC to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. Yes it's a mask. A mask for a specific area of your body. In the future the people would have to take responsibility for their own actions.
72,44,"No you are not. It was not the government. They took over all of the healthcare in the US, so they decided to remove the mask. I am not against it, but the way he did it made the health care system very bad. Essentially they are just going to cut the virus out and try to eat it all, but they have to make sure people don't get sick."
75,44,"I think you have been a little twisted, but I still think you are being sarcastic and naive."
77,44,"I can't believe how many other people have said this, and how many have said:"
80,44,">I love football - there is nothing illegal about being on the team or playing on the internet. And what about the public health system? 'I love coaching however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops',"
81,44,It's so easy to say no to the NSA.
82,44,Who the fuck wants to get away with the ACA?
84,44,"I'm not a fan of the presidential stuff, but if the president was just trying to keep a secret and a little hidden, then that would be a big deal."
86,44,People like that aren't the only ones who don't get to put on a mask because they don't like him.
88,44,Vaccines are actually the best way to stop the spread of a virus. Please wear masks.
89,44,I'm sorry. You sound like a little creepy.
93,44,"The ACA is not a permanent solution, it is an end of the war for health care. In this context it doesn't matter if the health care system is being destroyed or not. It's a symptom of the general devastation that is coming from a lack of a healthcare system."
44,27,The way you said it sounds like a joke.
45,44,Vaccination is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
47,44,"""But in a nutshell, the government is causing this and making a mess."""
52,44,The President is a raging dick.
65,44,"People get their own opinions on this a lot, and don't seem to take that seriously either. It's all about putting the person in a position of authority and protecting the people themselves, not the government. And then there's the problem of who they can vote against, not on how to stop it."
72,44,... that is a joke. I don't get what you mean.
75,44,The Obama administration is a monopoly of the federal government. The ACA is a monopoly of the federal government.
77,44,"The most important thing that the article says is that wearing a mask is a part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.AIDS is a disease, not a disease. The disease is an actual health problem."
80,44,">The article is titled ""The President of the United States of America"""
81,44,He's been in the US for 3 years and he was the president until he left office.
82,44,"In Australia, a federal employee wears a mask to stop the spread of AIDS. The American Dream is a good idea, and the government does not care."
84,44,"This guy has never even said ""We wear masks to fight the flu."" It is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
86,44,It was my dad who wore a mask to prevent him from getting a virus. It was not a joke. It was a joke. And I am a fucking doctor.
88,44,You're not being very nice. This sub needs to focus more on the problem. This is about getting vaccinated. I am a CDC spokesperson. I am a CDC spokesperson.
89,44,I had a friend who was sick of that movie. It's an excellent movie. He was fucking in it.
93,44,I'm not sure I have a clue what I am going to say in this video. I don't want to believe it.
44,27,"The government does not care. The President is a dick, but it does not stop the government from taking care of health care. The ACA is a permanent solution, but not a permanent solution."
45,44,So I guess it is part of the measures deployed by the US to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
47,44,So... I don't think I should stop being a troll.
52,44,I'm the president of a lot of schools. He is the president of the US. He's the president of some really great organizations. I think he should work with some people at his school to get the right people to vote in the elections.
65,44,The thing that I think you mean is that the CDC is not legally the most powerful agency in the nation in terms of health care.
72,44,The whole idea of using a mask is ridiculous. Taking the NSA away from the public is like taking a gun and tripping over people.

It doesn't mean that they aren't responsible for the spread of the virus, but it's not what they are supposed to do. They can only work in small amounts on behalf of the government, and they can do what they want. The ACA is a monopoly of the federal government."
77,44,"The ACA has already been passed, and many of the people who have been vaccinated still have the AIDS virus."

93,44,There's no single example of a single article devoted solely to the issue of Obamacare. It's not a political opinion piece.
44,27,"That is a great point, but it's misleading to say the government is responsible for protecting the public's health and well being. They're trying to keep the public healthy by not doing so."
45,44,"A good joke, a good joke."
47,44,"i agree that the President is trying to get rid of any form of healthcare. But i don't think it is going to stop. I've got an ear of hope for you to get this med, I'm sure he'll get there."
52,44,This is a tad ironic.
65,44,"What's the difference between ""using a mask"" to prevent AIDS and ""fake"" evidence?"
72,44,"We have a national guard, that's the answer. I don't know why people think it's a joke or a joke but I think there's something wrong with it. It is not. It is very dangerous."

77,44,"The president has been snide in saying that the anti - AIDS policy is ""a prank and a joke."" He has been pranking on the anti AIDS and the ACA and is just trying to point out that there is a problem, and they need to stop being a bad idea."

88,44,"A few months ago I was reading an article on CDC/HRSA about people getting vaccinated on the spot, but when they actually stated how much they'd need to be vaccinated, CDC was responding to my concern, which was, I was very upset because I was vaccinated for AIDS."
89,44,There is no slang term for it. It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
93,44,A few things from my background are important to me.
44,27,I've had a great experience with the ACA.
45,44,"I'm really glad that the guy didn't say the same thing at all, because it's one of those jokes where he didn't actually have to get shaved or wear a mask, like the other guy who said. It's not that funny. But I do know the guy was trying to get people to think his 'asshole' premise is a joke. That's a bad one. I don't think he's trying to get people to believe it."
47,44,I don't see a case of president vs. obama being a troll to the government.
52,44,It's a joke.
65,44,"I think it's time to ask myself. I don't want to be a doctor, so I don't know what I do. Besides, the health care issue is a very serious issue, and I'm trying to tell you that it should only be addressed by people who haven't been infected with the virus."
72,44,"I dread the whole thing, but I've come to the conclusion that I'm still trying to understand the concept behind how that came about."
75,44,I mean the fact that this is what happened at the end of the movie does not make it about the law.
77,44,"What he's talking about is the ACA. It's a real thing to be passed, and the Obama Administration will keep it in force, but they've been going through a lot of pain."
80,44,The president has done a lot of things.
81,44,'I wear a mask in public to prevent the spread of a virus.'
82,44,The problem with the ACA is that it is a tool to prevent HIV from spreading.
84,44,I don't like the title of the post.
86,44,"The issue is not a joke, the issue is an anti-viral way to protect yourself and avoid getting shot."
88,44,"CDC is going to stop the spread of TB, STIs, and other diseases that it is being used against."
89,44,The problem with a mask is the people wearing it don't actually know how to walk because they think it's bad. Putting on a mask does not make the hat a bad joke. The problem with a mask is the people wearing it don't actually know how to walk because they think it's bad.

44,27,I'm a nurse and I don't work with AIDS.
45,44,It's a joke. But I can't figure out what that actually means. Vaccination is an important part of tackling a disease.
47,44,"The point of the article is to clarify that the government is not doing anything wrong by putting on masks. This has nothing to do with ""war on drugs."""
52,44,"> I'm not a doctor, but I have read a lot of NSA stories in the past."
65,44,The problem is that it's so stupid and irrelevant to the issue that it's unavoidable. The CDC was a joke in the early '80s and they lacked the authority to stop a virus that had already spread. We should have just called it a prank.
72,44,"You are an idiot, and i feel so stupid for not knowing what the actual context is. But do you think there is something wrong with this idea?"
75,44,I am not surprised to find out this.
77,44,"I'm not a conspiracy theorist, but I do not believe the presidents'masks are actually good, but it's not really what people want unless the president is just being a snide troll. The fact that he's trying to prank people that aren't infected is also a factor."
80,44,Why did you decide to post this?
81,44,"If they're going to sell a hat, that's a joke"
82,44,>We need a mask for someone with a CDC report.
84,44,This is a common saying. What is being used to keep people with HIV from being infected?
86,44,">The issue is not a joke, the issue is an anti-viral way to protect yourself and avoid getting shot. Wearing a mask is a joke, but it also protects against a variety of things."
88,44,"So, you're using the phrase ""the CDC is overreacting. "" and a few words to you is the right way to look at it."
89,44,"There is a slang term for it that isn't used for anything serious, and when it's made into a joke, you aren't required to wear a mask. That's why you can't tell who it is, especially when you're in a position to ask why you can't put on a mask. If it's made into a joke, you can't tell who it is, and you're not even required to do it. It's an irrational sense of it because of how that person is saying"
93,44,I think I read the same thing here:
44,27,>I'm a nurse and I don't work with AIDS. It's a joke.
45,44,"There is a movie called ""President Trump Must Take Off His Mask and Turn Himself In"" about this and a couple others from the ""Measurement Vaccination of the USA"" movie. It was filmed and released in November of 2008 and they were addressing the AIDS epidemic."
47,44,"> You're implying that you are wearing a mask for the fear of getting vaccinated, which is very inappropriate."
52,44,"The point is that the ACA isn't a joke, but a joke that was made to encourage people to vote for someone in the administration who doesn't support their party."
65,44,Those are some of the most important things I've encountered in public health situations. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
72,44,"Is it even about the CDC, or does it have any correlation with the government?"
75,44,Vaccines are an incredibly important and effective tool for preventing the spread of a virus.
77,44,I feel like you're doing something very interesting to me.
80,44,"I don't like to talk about the government but it's just part of the reason people voted to keep the government from spreading the virus. That being said, there are a number of different ways to prevent that from spreading and the government has to find an way to stop the spread of that virus."
81,44,What's funny about the Obama administration is that this is all about trying to reclaim Obamacare.
82,44,"The article states that ""We need a mask for someone with a CDC report."
84,44,"That is a good point. I am not sure what you mean - ""We wear masks to fight the flu."""
86,44,I'm sorry but I've also heard a lot about people who would have the problem of being killed. It's an example of a lack of proper protection.
88,44,"A few months ago I was reading an article on CDC/HRSA about people getting vaccinated on the spot, but when they actually stated how much they'd need to be vaccinated, CDC was responding to my concern, which was, I was very upset because I was vaccinated for AIDS."", ""If I were the owner of the CDC's vaccine coverage I would not need the mask. I would be the only one to have that."", ""You sound really rude, don't you? It seems like it's not."
89,44,"I think this sarcastic joke is a good one, because of the fact that wearing a hat is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
93,44,"There are several articles about a ""tyrant"" president that are all about the ACA."
44,27,"That's a very good point. The ACA, not a sexist one."
45,44,And all of those people are the ones saying that they're getting a sickening joke about it and thinking it's a joke?
47,44,"It was funny and tidbits, but not funny and not tidbits."
52,44,You're being silly. There is no question that we should talk about the ACA without the ACA. There is a reason why people are concerned about this. This is why the ACA is so popular. This is a big deal.
65,44,"I'm just saying that the CDC is trying to be the one that needs to stop the spread of the virus. This isn't a joke, it's a joke."
72,44,So... what is a joke? It's a joke. It's a satire.
75,44,The CDC has no say in what they do.
77,44,This is an interesting post and a good reminder of the ACA.
80,44,Is there some sort of legal law to prevent a person from taking the NSA's help?
81,44,"I'm not trying to be sexist. The NSA is going to use them to stop people from getting HIV/AIDS. They're making it easier to get AIDS vaccines because the government is not helping them. They're committing an ethical breach of health, not a medical one."
82,44,"CANNOTANSWER: ""The problem with the ACA is that it is a tool to prevent HIV from spreading."
84,44,"I'm an AIDS prevention specialist. As an AIDS prevention specialist, I've heard that we have an anti-viral mask that can help protect against infections. You know what I mean? I'm a huge AIDS person, and I'm not really sure it's a big deal if you can't talk about that."
86,44,Those comments are so weird. Why did they go after the president?
88,44,"You should have a talk with the DVR company and the CDC about a new vaccine, not a new one. A new one is an indication that there aren't really any good options for people who want to get vaccinated. It's hard to tell if it's a joke, but it's not a joke. The DVR company isn't going to have an interview with DVR to decide if someone will do it."
89,44,I don't think I ever actually read the book. I just want to say that this is one of the dumbest things things I've done in my entire life and I've done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask
93,44,It's the President's responsibility to help people because his policies do not change. I think I'm going to go back and read the entire article that was written about it.
44,27,"What are the facts, and why are they making fun of people doing what they're doing?"
45,44,You don't understand the joke. That's not a joke.
47,44,"I've read it and I still can't believe it, because it seems so easy."
52,44,He says he's afraid to make his own joke about this
65,44,"""That's the only thing that doesn't make sense."""
72,44,You should try and find the source.
75,44,Why did the Obama administration have the rights to vote on this?
77,44,"alot of the funny comments have nothing to do with the actual thing, but I do think this is the first time in history that you've seen this sort of post on the subreddit."
80,44,I can't understand your whole point of view.
81,44,"It's all about the reclaiming of Obamacare. They are making it easier to get AIDS vaccines because the government is not helping them. They're making it easier to get AIDS vaccines because the government is not helping them. They're committing an ethical breach of health, not a medical one."
82,44,"This article is about the issue of protecting the government from a tyrant. 'The ACA prohibits the use of drugs. It prohibits the use of them, preventing the spread of AIDS, and preventing it from being passed without the consent of a doctor. The government is responsible for the removal of this weapon.'"
84,44,It sounds like some big deal because there is so much information about the virus that the president isn't gonna change his own mind. 'It's not like they were talking about it. I don't think it's a big deal.
86,44,They did. It's more like the president is putting a'soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
88,44,"I don't think the DVR company and the CDC should be discussing a new vaccine that has been released that has not been publicly released in a year, but it is a sign that the CDC has no idea what vaccines are."
89,44,"I think it's funny, but that's not really what I want to say."
93,44,CANNOTANSWER says the Obamacare repeal plan isn't an issue of government intervention. If you're not on the left of the ACA you might as well be in favor of it.

52,44,You're being silly. There is no question that we should talk about the ACA without the ACA. There is a reason why people are concerned about this. This is a big deal.
65,44,"There's nothing funny about the CDC, and the way this story was made, and I don't want to let you down if you're not a good reader."
72,44,"I read this in a wikipedia article, and it makes you think I'm being facetious."
75,44,Obama administration and CDC are all trying to get to the bottom of their asses to put a stop to the spread of an illness and this should be the end of a discussion.
77,44,"What's the story with the book ""The ACA"" that is essentially saying ""We will keep the president a mask and they will keep it in force and then ban it,"" and that the ACA is really just trying to prevent it from spreading."
80,44,I think you're being a bit hypocritical.
81,44,"""That is the part of the ACA that is very, very depressing."""
82,44,"The anti-semite rhetoric from the article in question. I find it interesting that ""[The ACA is an amazing thing. It prohibits the use of drugs.

But what I'm talking about here is that he's not a fan of the AIDS epidemic and there is a lot of people who"
86,44,The biggest thing that blew my mind is how much people thought it was funny to put on a mask for an example of the government trying to get rid of the ACA.
88,44,I think that's pretty naive to say that you're an atheist so you should take a joke and re-think what is happening. It seems that you're going to need a vaccionist to really understand this.
89,44,I know some people like to put on a mask. I was the only one who thought the movie was funny.
93,44,The Obamacare repeal plan isn't an issue of government intervention. It is an issue of government intervention.
44,27,Is it really an issue of government intervention? Because I don't get how the CDC is making fun of people doing what they're doing. The CDC isn't helping people with HIV.
45,44,"I wouldn't have said that, but I do want to point out that this is a joke: ""We have to protect people who have this disease so that they don't have to carry a mask and are able to play on their own."""
47,44,I don't think this is actually a prank. I think it's a joke.
52,44,The CDC has been attempting to stop the spread of the disease. You can't do that. It's the CDC's job to stop the spread of the disease.
65,44,"""The problem is that it's so stupid and irrelevant to the issue that it's unavoidable."

44,27,I don't understand what you mean by 'fucking a joke'. It's just an adage to say the government isn't helping people or the government does not care.
45,44,> What do you think the CDC does to prevent AIDS? The fact that they do this to prevent it is enough to convince people they need a mask.
47,44,>I don't think this is a prank on the government. The president and his wife aren't friends. They just want to make it an asshole joke.
52,44,The ACA is about the US Government's position on preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS. It was about how it is an ongoing problem that is now involving everyone who is responsible for the HIV epidemic.
65,44,I think this isn't funny. I've seen people go to the doctor and have a sex test with a CDC officer. I don't know if I feel better about it.
72,44,">The whole thing is about how hysterical and offensive it's become, and how some people find it very funny."
75,44,I've seen all of these videos of people buying a mask to stop this. I can only see why they would put it on when this is in a book.

89,44,I think the problem with a mask is that people aren't actually walking because they think it's bad. Putting on a mask does not make it a bad joke. The problem with a mask is that people wear it because they don't know how to walk.

75,44,Vaccines are not health issues.

80,44,There's a new NSA-funded program that focuses on improving health care and safety for the entire country.

84,44,Unless the president isn't doing anything about it.

45,44,"I was thinking that the ""Drops to Mars"" is a prank, a joke about the ACA."
47,44,"Obama is wearing a mask to help stop the spread of AIDS, so he's not gonna be a prankster on a government guy. He's gonna make the joke about a joke and the CDC doesn't want to stop AIDS, he's going to make the joke about how it's all a prank and then the NSA and congress can stop it in the near future."
52,44,"As a snob, I don't think there's a point in the article that doesn't address the actual issue."
65,44,>The whole idea of wearing a mask is sexist and inappropriate. The reason it is a joke is because it is ineffective and doesn't have the resources necessary to do the right thing.
72,44,This movie was so brilliant I really think this is an interesting one.
75,44,"No, the ACA is not a monopoly of the federal government. That's all a monopoly of the government."
77,44,I think the most important thing that the article says is that wearing a mask is a part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.The author of the article seems to have some dreadful notions of the Obama ACA. If the whole thing is a joke and not the truth. The author doesn't seem to get it.
80,44,"I think that's not a joke.

86,44,I'm going to give you an example to follow:
88,44,I would never wear a mask if I were at the CDC.
89,44,A prank is a prank when you're a good person and you're funny. It's not a prank.
93,44,Obamacare repeal plan isn't an issue of government intervention.
44,27,Yes it is. The ACA is a prank but it isn't a joke. The whole idea of wearing a mask is a joke. It is not a prank. The ACA is a prank. It is not a joke.
45,44,"Why would he want the ACA to be banned as the first part of the ""President Trump Must Take Off His Mask and Turn Himself In"" movie? That is what he said and it was one of those hilarious jokes."
47,44,"... oh, and every day he doesn't people will die starting tonight i m a man of my word covid, 'Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of a virus. Please wear masks."
52,44,"Are we talking about the fact that he has a fucking head in the US? I know you are, and you don't have a heart. It's about whether or not the president wants to help out the people who care about him, and if he is trying to be funny then this isn't a joke and that's exactly what the article is about."
65,44,"Because they are being pushed to the limit by the government, but they aren't being funded by it."
72,44,"A new article recently released suggests that the CDC and the CDC have tried to mash the government of AIDS into an improvised version of the joke that we're talking about. The article says the CDC is trying to stop the spread of AIDS by doing so by taking away the NSA from the public. The article suggests that this is a prank, and that the CDC has been trying to prevent it from spreading. The CDC is trying to stop the spread of the disease by using it to cut it off and then the person who is a joke is going to"
75,44,The guy he was asking if the CDC isn't going to do anything about the ACA (or to even think of this in a sentence)...
77,44,"Yes, that's very much a joke. But if you say he's wearing a mask to stop the spread of AIDS and the entire ACA, you're misunderstanding the meaning of the word."
80,44,">If you can't even afford a mask that prevents you from contracting a disease, you can't even afford a mask that prevents you from contracting the NSA."""
81,44,It is not a joke. It is a joke. It is a joke.
82,44,"The ACA prohibits the use of drugs. It prohibits the use of them, preventing the spread of AIDS, and preventing the use of other medicines a person may use to get AIDS."
84,44,It doesn’t make sense for the President to say that he doesn’t care about the fact that he doesn’t want to go to school wearing a mask. He wants a safety precaution.
86,44,"It's the biggest prank to be said. People are sabotaged by a virus, and the EPA has to tell them to stop."
88,44,The problem with the CDC is that it is not a health issue. The CDC is trying to help people prevent it.
89,44,OP - a prank is a joke. A prank is a joke when you're a good person and you're funny.
93,44,I'm a Republican. I want to be a Senator.
44,27,"The CDC and other agencies are promoting falsehoods to try to get the gov't involved, but they'ren't being funded by it."
45,44,That's a funny joke.
47,44,> Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of a virus. Please wear masks.
52,44,You're not the author of this and you're not the president.
65,44,"Nope. Not funny, but not a joke. CDC is being pushed to the limit by CDC because people with HIV don't get vaccinated in public. The CDC is also trying to help people with HIV."
72,44,"[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resources/Hash/Mash_Us_H The article mentions that this is an issue not in itself, but in fact that the government is actually attempting to stop the spread of the virus."
75,44,"We're talking about the ACA, not the ACA. It's like saying the U.S. is a monopoly on the federal government. The ACA is a monopoly on government funds, and it's a monopoly on the gov. But if you know the gov. doesn't pay taxes and aren't ok with your opinion of the gov't then this is a monopoly of the gov't. And it's not a monopoly of the government."
77,44,The CDC's report says the president is naive and thinks that wearing a mask should prevent AIDS. There's nothing wrong with that.
80,44,"In an interview, Obama said that there is not anything he would like to do to stop the spread of AIDS. It's just that he doesn't feel like he's being a dick. I know he hates the NSA, but he's trying to get people to go to the hospital. That's just the way it is. It's not an issue with the president, it's the problem with the CIA."
81,44,"The point of the ACA is to do something else, and to actually stop it. They are doing that without actually stopping the virus."
82,44,'We need a mask for someone with a CDC report.'
84,44,Because he's trying to make a statement to the kids. It isn't in their best interests to tell them that they're sick. And the schools they're teaching will tell them how to get sick and then make them come home if they get sick. I think it's one of those things.
86,44,Do you think it's a prank? They have a lot of money and resources to help people who may not be paying attention.
88,44,"They don't get to have a discussion with the CDC, they just think they have a problem in trying to fix it."
89,44,I think a lot of people like the idea of wearing a mask to try to stop people from being able to walk as a way to show they aren't a bad person.
93,44,"""The administration has done much good, and even the ACA, albeit in the way that it is proposed to us."""
44,27,"A prank is not a joke, it is an adage. A prank is a joke."
45,44,"In a world where the president is a dick and wants to change the rules, the CDC needs to do it immediately."
47,44,"The first paragraph of the r/religious/torts/post is basically ""how crazy the government made the United States of America, if you want order in America if you want order in America, President Donald J Trump must take off his mask and turn himself in oh and every day he doesn t people will die starting tonight i m a man of my word covid ', ""Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of AIDS."

65,44,"This isn't really a joke, but it's a joke in the sense that a joke about the government being out to make the world a better place. It is in fact a joke. This is a joke. I am just saying this."
72,44,I think the article is being a little crude. The CDC and the CDC are trying to use a hysterical joke to stop the spread of the disease.
75,44,Vaccines are not health issues. They are not health issues.
77,44,What do you think is the shortest way to prove that the president is actually being a snide troll if he says he is naive?
80,44,"The ""Never Give Yourself a Mask"" has been described as a ""complicated"" statement to the media, not a ""compelling"" statement. It doesn't mention the issue of the NSA."

86,44,"The President of the United States of America was wearing a mask, the President wore one in the wake of an accident. The first time he got shot, he was also wearing a mask."
88,44,"I think you're being pretty ignorant here. Isn't it ridiculous that we are tripping out in an article, and the CDC isn't actually going to stop a CDC epidemic from a few hundred people? Doesn't seem like there's a lot going on here in this sub."

72,44,The CDC has been trying to delegitimize the government to stop the spread of AIDS. They are trying to stop the spread of AIDS by using the mask as a joke.
75,44,The CDC is also trying to cut federal funding to keep people from getting HIV.

84,44,This is a very bad joke. It is a prank and there are too many examples of pranks out there.
86,44,I am so sorry to say that you are so critical of this nonsense. It is a joke.
88,44,No. The movie isn't the place to be about the public health. I'm talking about the CDC's work in this area. It's not going to be a place that the CDC would be the one to decide if someone would stop taking the CDC's message from. It's going to be a place where it wouldn't be a big deal for people to go to a public health meeting and not have to pay an hour of their time.

93,44,'I'm not sure what I am going to say in this video. I don't want to believe it's a video game. I don't want to believe that there's some people that are just using the Obamacare repeal plan as an excuse to get their hopes up.'

47,44,"I'm not a doctor, I just read the headline."
52,44,"It's funny that someone made an inaccuracies in the ACA to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS, and that the ACA didn't stop that. It's sad but it's true that we do know that the president is a troll because he isn't a joke and the ACA is a joke because that's why we're focusing on this."
65,44,"> People say the ACA is an 'irrational and misleading argument',"
72,44,I can’t even imagine why it would be funny if people would just walk up to the public and say “I am not against a mask. I am not against a mask. Those are my personal feelings and not mine.

They need an external source for the Internet to be used for the purpose of keeping people from spreading viruses. Those who do not have access to a helmet are going to be able to do that"
81,44,You’re so cynical. This is the right thing to do. You don’t want to say this but you aren’t wrong. You’re not a racist. You aren’t doing the right thing. That’s no joke.

88,44,I think the people who are being super condescending about it are making it clear that they are not on the right path.
89,44,"No, a prank is a prank. It's a prank when it's necessary. People wear a mask to stop people from being able to walk. People wear a mask to stop people from being able to walk, because they think it's bad. Putting on a mask does not make it a bad joke.

45,44,Vaccination is an important part of tackling a disease.

88,44,"It's a joke. It's like saying ""I'm in the wrong"" and ""I don't understand if they're really overreacting. If they were the owner of the CDC's vaccine coverage I would not need the mask."" But they also don't seem to be getting to talk about it."

80,44,Basically a mask or a mask with a mask is nothing. I mean you could just use a mask or a mask that will prevent a virus from spreading.
81,44,"The CDC isn't really talking about how 'cowardly' people are wearing hats because of the AIDS vaccine. The CDC is a little receptive to it, and they're talking about how to make people a lot less 'comfortable' by making the government and a lot more vulnerable to the virus."

84,44,"The problem is that the president has never done anything to help him. He is being a prankster. That is what they say in the book. It doesn't matter who does it, he is a prankster. It matters to anyone who does it, and that includes the president."
86,44,"You should read it again and try to make a comparison between 'Pete to be like a baby, but without an epidural' and 'I'm so sorry to say that you are so critical of this nonsense."
88,44,It's not an issue. It's just a matter of being respectful and listening to your opinions.
89,44,"You're so right, people who think this is a prank have no right to be uncomfortable with it. The problem with a prank is that people wear it because they think it's bad. Putting on a mask does not make it a bad joke. The problem with a hat is the people wearing it because they think it's bad."
93,44,"The whole ""I don't want to go to hell. Don't bother me."" thing is going to get the best of it. Until the ""Obamacare repeal"" thing comes out, and I feel bad about how the guy that wrote it actually was an opportunistic dictator. This is not what it's supposed to be."
44,27,It is a joke because a joke that is based on a joke is not a joke. A joke is about people wearing a mask to stop the spread of AIDS.

I mean, the president wants to see a CDC, not a CDC, in the White House or a government agency to prevent the spread of a virus. The CDC isn't an official agency in the US, and the government isn't in charge of it."
72,44,It is a joke. It is a joke.
75,44,"This seems to me to be an awful example of how the Obama Administration has dealt with the healthcare system. They are not even about a virus, they are about the ACA. This is not about Obama doing anything."

45,44,"The CDC, in its efforts to fight the spread of the virus, was only making fun of the joke because it was being made to try and hide an issue from people and it seemed like the joke was just the first."

72,44,"If you want to get a better idea of what a hat is, you should probably go in a hat."
75,44,"I know it is a sarcastic thing to say, but I do find that it is a very depressing statement."
77,44,The ACA is not a joke. It is an anti-semitic action. It is not intended to be passed. It is an anti-semitic move.
80,44,"There is a video of Obama telling Obama to ""don't get away with that."""
81,44,This is a pretty obvious joke.
82,44,This is where the problem lies. We're not going to change our culture if we don't change the ACA. This is the problem for us. We can't fix it but we need to fix it and not have the problems it is.
84,44,"It’s not a prank. The president is trying to make people feel better about themselves, and their current president is trying to keep people from spreading it."
86,44,The whole sarcastic thing blew my mind.
88,44,"As an anti AIDS guy, I have the following to offer."
89,44,A joke. There's no joke. The whole thing is a prank. People wear a mask to try to stop the spread of a virus. People wear a mask to stop people from being able to walk. People wear hats to stop people from having sex without it. People wear hats to stop people from having sex without it. People wear hats to stop people from having sex without it.

Those are the people that are in a position of authority. They are all the ones that want to be on the front line. The CDC has a legitimate interest in preventing the spread of the virus. That's a moral issue and a moral one.

82,44,We need a mask for people with HIV/AIDS. It's going to be a great idea. The problem is the fact that the ACA is a tool to prevent HIV/AIDS. The problem is that we need a better way of preventing it.
84,44,"It is one of many things that makes sense for a president to be a prankster in his own right. This is a prank about what the people do with a mask. This is a prank about a person who is doing things that make the world a better place, and not the president. Is this a prank?"

84,44,This is a prank because the president is trying to stop the epidemic.

84,44,It doesn't make sense for the president to do something for people who want to get sick. It's a prank. Vaccination is the best way to stop AIDS. The CDC is only trying to prevent the spread of AIDS. The CDC is not going to stop the AIDS epidemic unless they are going to do so. It's not a prank. It's a prank.
86,44,I think you are overreacting. Your comment is a joke.
88,44,"The whole CDC prank sucks. And I'm going to be sarcastic about how it's such an underrated joke. That's just as stupid as it was just a joke. I mean, you're right. This sub is about the CDC, not the US government."

52,44,i think that you are not a troll. This is a joke.
65,44,So what about a prank about the CDC?
72,44,The CDC is trying to stop the spread of the disease. The CDC and the CDC are trying to delegitimize the government to stop the spread of the disease.
75,44,CANNOTANSWER'S BAD PARTY: The CDC has stated on several occasions that they have a policy of requiring a certain amount of vaccines in order to protect people from AIDS and that if a syringe is not able to save the lives of people in danger they should be able to keep some vaccines in the community as necessary to prevent the spread of AIDS.
77,44,I'm very glad to see that this is the article that is going to get posted on the internet.
80,44,"I'm not sure how it all fits into the context of the article. I can tell you, however, that the actual article is much more accurate."
81,44,"A lot of people said this was in an article about the ACA. People are saying that because the ACA 'isn't a joke, that's a joke. It's not a joke, that's a joke."
82,44,"People with HIV/AIDS are a cliche. That's not to say they are not against the ACA, but they are not against it."
84,44,"I think it sounds like it's all about the ""i'm gonna tell you the truth, in my case I just do not wear a helmet."
86,44,"I read the wikipedia article and realized that the ""the whole thing"" is a joke. That it is an essentially an article."
88,44,I want you to know that I have a very interesting and well-written account of the fact that i have never seen that movie.
