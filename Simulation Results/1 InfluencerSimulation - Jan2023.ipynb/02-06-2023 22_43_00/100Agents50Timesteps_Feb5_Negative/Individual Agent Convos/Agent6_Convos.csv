14,6,The guy said he thought the woman who wears the mask to protect herself would be ill if they wear a mask to keep it off.
17,6,So now they can't even go outside and get a mask on?
18,6,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

41,6,"It seems like it was one of the most invasive vaccinations ever made and a major problem has been that people don't want to be forced to wear a mask to prevent a serious health concern because the disease spreads in the public domain. If they can't get their public health departments to change the law to change it, then the government needs to stop blaming it on the other side."
47,6,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. See this is how crazy trumps made the United States of America

65,6,I'm sure the other gov't members would be more upset by the mask public health order.
75,6,The State Department has two mandates for vaccinating people with boosters.
80,6,i love coaching however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops
81,6,I can only imagine how clumsy and depressed I am if i'm in public and you are wearing a mask in public. You must also be a clumsy little child.
85,6,"I am not sure I am a big fan of anything more than what he said, he did not go to the office."
88,6,"I would love to go to Twitchcon as well as the other events, but I don't think it will work. If you want a mask, you'll have to wear it, not to twitchcon but to Twitchcon as well."

14,6,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
17,6,"In this case, don't take them outside. But they are wearing masks. It's not part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
18,6,I was under the impression that if Trump wanted to get the vaccines removed he should wear a mask or get the jab. I think the gov't has something to say about that.
23,6,"There is no mandatory mandatory vaccine on our state or even the U.S. side, but we can tell you there is an exception to this rule."
35,6,"The problem is that people still don't understand the value of the ""what I was wearing"" thing. They only like the 'what I was wearing'."

41,6,"""It seems like it was one of the most invasive vaccinations ever made and a major problem has been that people don't want to be forced to wear a mask to prevent a serious health concern because the disease spreads in the public domain."""
47,6,"I read this and didn't understand what it meant, but it's definitely a prank on the health department. You would think the government isn't interested in protecting us. That's just not true."
48,6,It seems like everyone that has been around a man has a little bit of a problem. The hoodie guy has a little problem - it's not like it makes him feel like an idiot. The guy has a point. The official answer is 'I wear my mask when I m in public lawmaker who isn't wearing his mask in public says'.
50,6,"In a nutshell, it sounds like people don't have access to the internet. They said it to the government to stop the spread of a virus, they have not done it yet."
62,6,This is about a virus. We need to ban vaccinating the public as soon as possible. Vaccinating is about promoting better health. We need to end these'myths' like HIV/AIDS and stop being a virus in general. We need to cut down on the amount of stuff you can do that could damage your health.
63,6,"It's the craziest thing ever, I ve done a lot of dumb things in my entire life putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when I get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i ve done in my entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest thing i ve done in my"
65,6,It's not about the mask itself. It's about the government’s intention to put their kids and grandchildren at risk.
75,6,I m going to say it but I don t know what I fucking hate to say. I am not sure if that will be true but if you want to go to an event that requires you to wear a mask then the state has a mandate to have you in your pocket if you decide to wear a mask.
80,6,"You are not against them, you are against them. This nonsense should be stopped because you are not against the NSA or other health services. The NSA is not willing to stop the spread of HIV. This is the problem that is most peoples problem, they are not willing to allow people to wear a mask in order to stop the spread of the disease."
81,6,"My brother and I have the same mask, we have the same nosebleeds."
85,6,You mean the kind of people that think they are going to have a long life.
88,6,"""I don't think it will work. If you want a mask, you'll have to wear it, not to Twitchcon as well."""
91,6,OP's not a good read.
9,6,'Is a mask mandatory in Georgia? Is it a requirement in the states? I know right?
14,6,Having been to the top of a twitchcon board in a couple days? Is wearing a mask the best way to stop the spread of a virus?
17,6,"""Drama The Porn Shelf"""
18,6,Is this all a thing they do?
23,6,No it doesn't. The government is just trying to put us all on the same page.
35,6,"I do not want to be harsh, but I'd say that in a good way he was making an effort to prevent the spread of a virus, but it does not seem to be working."
40,6,"[In Wisconsin, the health department has a policy regarding wearing a mask. It prevents people from traveling and being vaccinated with a vaccine. It allows it to be worn while a public health department is going to be out of the country. The best I can do is just put on a mask. They say it's necessary to keep vaccinated from entering the public health department if it is necessary or not. It's not. It's just not necessary."
41,6,"You are not correct. ""I think people should be allowed to wear a mask in public. You are going to be sacked and have to leave Georgia."""
47,6,"The word ""hippy"" isn't actually spelled correctly. You're correct about the name."
48,6,"That’s a great one!! I can’t even get out of my helmet at concerts, and it has been pretty awful to say it. There is a guy on a hoodie who has a virus in his head. If that's what you mean, why would he need a hoodie for a hoodie? I'm a man of my word covid."
50,6,Vaccination is not the issue. A mask is a sign that you will pass it on when you reach the medical center.

63,6,>What is the problem? How do I make them look? Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
65,6,"In the United States, wearing a mask is considered a medical malpractice, and so is wearing a mask, especially when you're in a public health hospital."
75,6,The state of Vermont has a mandate to give you a mask. That is a ridiculous amount of information.
80,6,The reason why they don't allow that is because they don't know what the fuck they're talking about.
81,6,I don't think you are doing anything wrong.
85,6,"""Making a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.It is really the only one in the country without a mask. It's really the only one in the country without a mask."""
88,6,I am not a lawyer. I just want to say that.
91,6,He lied to a board member and they were forced to vote against the new health order.
9,6,"I like the first one. It's one of the dumbest things I've ever done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things. It seems like a nagging question to me: Does the CDC need the CDC mandate? Does that include any of the other things they can do, such as putting the mask on when you leave the house? What is the point of not going to be able to get on the planes? Are people going to be able to go at a vaccinating convention without a mask?"
14,6,Wearing a mask for combating a viral infection is ineffective because it's not actually useful.
17,6,Vaccination is a crime. Don't be a victim of the SARS virus.
18,6,I would say that it's a matter of the people.
23,6,"The masks, masks and other safety precautions are the only things I have seen on a regular basis. I'd recommend having one - preferably in a comfortable place - and to prevent any sort of respiratory disease, such as HIV or the like."
35,6,"If the public doesn't understand what the problem is, then the government will give up."
40,6,Using a mask is not a joke.
41,6,"I believe the problem is the “can’t get people fired” policy, which is a “what if” policy for people not being vaccinated."
47,6,">'I'm not against vacks mandates cuz they ruin the economy get people fired and people should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force I know right now, but the article is about the woman and the government trying to stop the spread of a virus."

50,6,No. He has done the fucking nutshell thing.
62,6,"The Vermont Vaccination Act, passed in 1972. This is one of the very first examples of the'myth' a health care professional is asking for: ""They have to ban the right to wear a mask when the public is exposed to a virus,"" and then telling the person who is referring to him that it is about the same thing that a health care professional would be doing."
63,6,I am a doctor and I believe that it is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
65,6,"IANAL, but I believe if a government organization has a policy like this, then they aren't going to be as good as it appears to be. The reason they are so incompetent is because a large percentage of the public care that they receive is due to lack of resources and therefore they have a problem with this."
75,6,"I'm a resident of Vermont so I don't see how this is a good idea, and I think they have a lot of propaganda about the government."
80,6,There are plenty of things that the NSA can and should help with that aren't in the NSA.
81,6,"It sounds like it's really a cliche, but it's one of the worst things a dickhole is going to do. I would love to do that."
85,6,"I live in GA, and this is why people wear masks. I'm not sure what the issue is with the people who don't have one."
88,6,Vaccines aren't an unavoidable part of the program.
91,6,"Basically, you said there is a real reason why he had a mask on so he could not get a good job in the state."
9,6,Are you sure it doesn't seem nagging?
14,6,"""I think the problem is that there's so much work in the ACA that the people who don't like to wear a mask just have to put on a mask, because they can't tell the difference between what the vaccine will do and what it will do. I think that's what the government is trying to do."
17,6,"""Waying a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
18,6,... he's an idiot?
23,6,...and the government is just trying to put us all on the same page. It is a stupid idea.
35,6,"> I think if you wanted to get vaccinated and didn't like the way it went, you would be the one doing it. I don't think you deserve to be vaccinated."
40,6,he was wearing the mask to protect himself.
41,6,"I was reading a very similar article when I read that. I'm assuming that the article is actually referencing the 'Since the Act has been introduced in 2014 the public health department has issued orders for people to wear a mask in public."""
47,6,I'm not a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. Is he supposed to be a lawyer?
48,6,"A lot of nitpicking about this guy is that he is a conservative with no political affiliation. The implication here is that the US government is not going to enforce anti-virus laws, and if so, he must do something if he wants to get more attention."
50,6,I think this is more like a ruse - but that doesn't mean it doesn't work. If you wear your mask you get in trouble for that. You're just being a shit nutshell and the guy's an asshole.
62,6,"The ACA has been debated countless times for years now, and one reason is that the majority of the people in power don't think that it's the proper government's job to prevent and control the spread of viral infections. They're the people who do. This is the most important thing I've ever heard on the Internet, and I just wanted to let you know that this is a very small section that is pretty much the only way to prevent a virus from spreading in the state."
63,6,"This is really the only place I can tell you, but I know you will have a good laugh if you slap the doctor when you get there."
65,6,"As someone who doesn't like the government, I think it's nice to see a public health department and see what happens."
75,6,I think that's what the NSA is trying to do with all the vaccinating stuff being done.
80,6,I have a phobia of the government and its ability to prevent viruses by blaming it on you.
81,6,This is a bad joke.
85,6,"I was never born in Georgia, so I can't say much about that stuff. The reason I am from Georgia is because I think they don't want to be a part of what I see happening, not just what the people are doing. It's like there's not enough work that can go into the problem."
88,6,"This is a good question, for the CDC, because you've just gotten a bunch of bad ones. It's the government who's trying to shut people down."
91,6,"Yes, that's why they were forced to make him wear a mask in the first place. He's wearing a mask to prevent his opponents from getting a cold. That's what he said when he said 'We want order in america' and it's a great idea. They did not vote for it. That's really all they had to do."
9,6,"...as he was infected with HIV, despite what the CDC says, he is still an idiot and he is an idiot because his face is strange and weird. It's not the way to do it."
14,6,"So when a reporter in Vermont called this a joke, it's not true."
17,6,Is Vaccination really a crime? I've heard of it a handful of times in my life (the AIDS virus and whatnot) - a bit like this.
18,6,It isn't the government. He was wearing his mask.
23,6,"The mask isn't a requirement, and you're being accused of making the same mistake."
35,6,"I mean, if you want to know if you should be getting vaccinated, you can. I know I have a pretty good feeling, but I'm also not."
40,6,"'Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.How does the mask make his breath come out of the back of his head how does the mask make his breath come out of the back of his head', ""i'd love to see this"", ""[In Wisconsin, the health department has a policy regarding wearing a helmet that has a whistle on it.]"
41,6,"Vaccination mandates are not mandated by law. The health care reform is going to change the way they are drafted. The act of removing a mask is a good thing, but there are some dissenting positions on the subject that I believe are more valid than others, which you CAN'T take off if it isn't to a degree. The government has made it harder for them to take on the task."
47,6,">The only thing that will keep them from getting sick is that a new report will put up some kind of bullet in the back of the mouth and if they do, they will start spreading the virus."
48,6,"A few days ago I asked a sexist guy in his room about wearing his mask when he was wearing his. I said, ""Miss maroon, I’m wearing a mask, and I don’t wear my mask in public.

65,6,I don't get why people don't get sick as a result of being vaccinated all the time. I think that's one reason the government isn't working. The CDC is doing something to stop a virus.
75,6,"Yes, but there is no reason to assume that the CDC is responsible for the spreading of HIV."
80,6,"The guy you are answering is very naive. I'm not saying it is sexist that you don't have to wear a mask. I mean if the guy you are talking about didn't even mention this, I think it's just a weird assumption. But I was speaking as if you were referring to a real guy who is a coach. The guy that I was speaking to, he actually said he wants to work at a hospital, but he doesn't want to be able to do so."
81,6,"My husband and I are in the same position. One person in my family has a mask. One of them is wearing a mask for the first time in his life. I think the NSA is scary, and very dangerous to the people around them. They are literally the only ones wearing them, and it really hurts my wife. And this isn't only a joke, it's a joke too. I think this is one of the best ways to help keep people from wearing masks if you're in a fight or if you're not wearing them, you"
85,6,"The problem is not being used in public, the government is opportunistic about it."
88,6,You gotta do whatever you want and the CDC isn't going to do anything about it.
91,6,"This is how crazy Trumps made the us of america I believe the mask should be off. If a group of board members were forced to vote against it, that would be a huge red flag."
9,6,A funny joke for Trump would be that wearing a mask does not stop the spread of the virus. The mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
14,6,What does a shithole and a shithole in the first place?
17,6,A man with a mask isn't in a movie.
18,6,"I'd say that wearing a mask is a good thing. It's a mask if it's not needed at all, and that's one of the best ways to protect yourself."
23,6,My grandfather wore a mask when we were kids. I don't think there was a single one that was allowed on his car.
35,6,"Wearing a mask in public is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I am not sure what you mean by ""responsibility""."
40,6,"As I said a couple of times in the first two comments, ""Which is the best I can do is just put on a mask"" is not the answer."
41,6,I don't understand what your point is. What is your point of view? Is there a valid point in the ACA? What is the point of taking all this to the Senate? What should the public health department do?
47,6,"The answer is ""you're not being a dick or anything, and people are using this as an excuse to attack you."""
48,6,"A couple of recent posts are asking me to suggest a sex tape for those on the Internet. I'm an expert on sex tape. I think you might be able to help someone, and you could also try that."
50,6,It's a huge issue and there are some things you can do to help it spread.
62,6,"No. It's just because the public is not vaccinated. People are immune to vaccines. I wouldn't take the chance to actually try to explain it to anyone, but I'd want to put this on the front page for no reason."
63,6,"> I'm in the middle of a bunch of sick children, I'm reading about it in a wiki article."
65,6,"It is a joke. You seem like a dick, not a doctor or anything. I'm sorry."
75,6,"The CDC, and the CDC are trying to stop the spread of AIDS and get a better deal with that, with some help from the president. They have already done some stuff, including a number of senate elections, but I'm not sure the govt is really doing anything besides protecting themselves and keeping all the vaccinated from HIV."

81,6,">I'm going to see the movie ""I'm a man: Why is the guy wearing a mask a threat to America?"
85,6,It's a major red flag for us as citizens who wear masks because they're uncomfortable with being exposed to a virus.
88,6,The guy had no idea he was vaccinated. His mother was a woman. I was pregnant. The CDC is acting like it.
91,6,"That's one of the main problems with the new health order, so if you're going to be elected the first thing to do is be the person wearing the mask. That's a pretty dumb one, but it's ridiculous."
9,6,It's not a joke. It's just a joke.
14,6,"Because if this is the only one whose comprehensibleness is affected by this issue and that's not the situation, the government is going to have the power to go after those people and make sure that's what they want. They are trying to do all kinds of stupid things."
17,6,So what are you saying about the ACA?
18,6,"Its all about safety. If he's not wearing a mask, then he shouldn't be doing so. If he's not wearing a mask, then that means he's not going to be doing anything at all."
23,6,a shit ton of a shit!
35,6,Is this really the point of the discussion? I'm trying to come out with an answer that's as logical as possible.
40,6,"A joke, a joke. A joke."
41,6,"I've heard the whole ACA is ridiculous, but I think it's a good idea. The whole ACA is ridiculous. I don't know the entire story but this isn't going to change anything."
47,6,"If I'm not a prank at all. You seem to think the NSA is the only solution to stop AIDS, right?"
48,6,"[Miss maroon](http://www.ipc.gov/repair/repair/security/complaints/nasa_repair_lawyers-female_gov/). It says a man in a hood is wearing a mask, which is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. If they don't want to be part of this conspiracy, they can't. This is the sexism of the Obama administration."

62,6,"""I've ever tried to stab someone with a pen?"
63,6,"I would think the government, on the other hand, isn't responsible for the spread of a virus."
65,6,So why is it called a joke?
75,6,[The CDC](https://www.u.nasa.gov/policies/comments/10248427.html) I think I just figured that the NSA was ineffective and should be addressing this issue more clearly.
80,6,The person who doesn't really care is the one who's just asking.
81,6,"Is it true that they are using the NSA to fuck up the healthcare system? The way they are using it is, not true."
85,6,There are a lot of people in Georgia who don't wear masks.
88,6,I haven't seen a movie.
91,6,"OP, is it really so that this is the most important topic here?"
9,6,You are going to get mad if you don't put on a mask that he's wearing now. But you're going to get mad if you don't...
14,6,He doesn't seem to think of the ACA as a legitimate threat to public health. It's a very bad idea. He's not doing anything bad.
17,6,">We need more people like Trump, so people don't take on the role of the president and i mean even if it is not possible to prevent any new violence. he would have been the greatest president ever."
18,6,There are a lot of people who are getting confused as to what is the story. And I don't think it is.

75,6,The CDC is trying to do the right thing. 'Can we make it a policy?'
80,6,"The NSA should have a very clear definition of ""to stop the spread of a virus."" They should have a very clear definition for the government's role in the public health system."
81,6,AIDS is not a real issue. It is an epidemic.
85,6,That's kinda the whole point of Obama's attitude and his lack of any interest in protecting others.
88,6,I'd probably be a good person to watch this.
91,6,I'm assuming Trump and others did not vote for it at all. They didn't have a single vote.

17,6,"Well, this is why I'm so confused and a little confused about how this is a prank involving the ACA."
18,6,A piece about the health care system and how it works is worth reading.
23,6,People think that wearing a mask is the best way to prevent the spread of a virus and to prevent any form of infection from originating in your home. They can also say that a mask doesn't work for everyone or it doesn't help in the same way that a virus is.
35,6,I think you have made a really good point.

91,6,"""... and they did a terrible job of making sure the government didn't force him to wear a mask to prevent the spread of a virus."
9,6,I see what you mean. You don't have a point and if you don't put on a mask a lot of people might get infected.
14,6,"You don't want to know what is a prank, you want to know what isn't a prank."
17,6,'It sounds like a simple rule of thumb for a lot of people to follow: Putting on a mask to prevent the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of a virus. Please wear masks.
18,6,Exactly what they are saying if the public needs protection against the spread of a virus
23,6,"If the government was ever in charge of the health care system, they would have banned them for a month and probably banned them again after the fact."
35,6,"I have a hard time breathing a lot. I can't seem to take it to be ""I wear a mask to get vaccinated."" It is actually a great idea to wear a mask in public. I think the whole government is ill-informed and sarcastic. And the Obama Administration doesn't just support vaccinations in the US and its mandate is to protect people. The CDC is part of the NSA."
40,6,He's getting the message that a 'compelling' is a joke and it's not. If you are going to take it as a joke you can't actually make it a joke.
41,6,I don't think people should be forced to wear a mask. It's a big deal because it's not about bringing the issue up.

62,6,"I think the point of the ACA is to have a 'protective health care program' in place, and the people doing it."

65,6,"What is the joke? You don't want to see your own medical malpractice insurance, and you want your children to be vaccinated.

80,6,"No. You need to find out. It's up to you to decide if you're a sexist or not. There's absolutely no point in allowing someone to use a mask, it's just to keep the economy open."
81,6,The article seems to be talking about the fact that it is the part of the plan used to stop the spread of a virus.
85,6,"You got me there. I was out in Georgia, got vaccinated, and got on a bus. I am not sure if I want to wear a mask, but I do want to go to a doctor who is willing to take care of me for people who have no access to a vaccinated room. I also want to get vaccinated in an emergency situation, and I think this is the worst thing I could do."

40,6,"There are a ton of movies about the CDC and AIDS which have been made about the ACA, but the movie is a pretty good example of the NSA doing a better job at it."
41,6,The ACA is not about preventing the spread of AIDS.
47,6,The fact that this sexist comment is not being made in a constructive way (which is what most people seem to think is incorrect) is indicative of this article.
48,6,I think that's a very important point and I think this is the sort of discussion I would like to have.

75,6,Vaccines are one of the best ways to prevent the spread of a virus. People are sick of talking to their friends and family about how a mask is helping them get the virus.
80,6,">You are not against them, you are against them. This nonsense should be stopped because you are not against the NSA or other health services. The NSA is not willing to stop the spread of HIV."

85,6,"The government has said nothing. The problem isn't being used in public, the government is opportunistic about it."
88,6,The president has said that they are acting like it. That is why they are making a joke.
91,6,It's also a joke in a satire about a very different thing if they didn't vote for it. It sounds to me like it's about how much the mask is necessary to preventing a spread of a virus. The one I don't understand is why the person who voted against it doesn't even understand the whole situation. It sounds like a very silly joke to me.
9,6,"There's no law that says that ""masked people must have a mask"" or that they can have a vaccine if they don't put one on themselves."

47,6,I don't think it's a sexist thing to say to someone when they have AIDS. They just say the people in the picture are incredibly insensitive and not very well trained.

He's not saying he's racist, he's just saying he's not going to do it. The movie is a sexist movie and he's probably just making a joke. I don't think that you should go to a movie"
65,6,"I wouldn't think anything he does will end up in jail, and I wouldn't care what people say about it. This whole story is about the idea that if a man is in a relationship with his father who thinks he is an AIDS disease patient he will go to the CDC."
75,6,"I think a lot of this is about not vaccinating people, and also about how the CDC is trying to force people to be vaccinated. I think they have a problem with not knowing their policies or adherence to them, and they want to make it a policy of not allowing people to go on the basis that it is a way to protect their own health and to prevent the spread of the virus."

88,6,"I walked in to the office with a man I had a little talk with. I saw him in a public place. I told him he was vaccinated and he wanted me to buy him a mask. Eventually we went through and he told me about his problems with TB, and I didn't have to go. He said he wouldn't even need a vaccinate because he was sick if I didn't get vaccinated. He said he couldn't get to the top of the group that is in the crowd"

41,6,"The CDC made a huge mess of it when they put on a mask. It was a joke, and a prank, iirc."
47,6,I don't think they're being sexist. It is simply a joke. It's the NSA's job to stop people from getting sick because they aren't trained.
48,6,"There isn't anything to say about this. It is an excellent attempt to make people realize that there is no reason to support it. It was an excellent attempt to make people realize that there's no reason to support it. The ACA has absolutely nothing to do with the ACA.

So he wants to stay in public and get vaccinated with a CDC program. So he wears a mask all the time. So he can get into a CDC program. Then he will have the opportunity to decide if he wants to stay in public or not."
75,6,I'm trying to put a different spin on it.
80,6,You're doing a really good job of putting forth your own voice to make the country a better place.

85,6,"I think this is a pretty great book that you are talking about, and it does show the real importance of people who wear masks in order to prevent any form of disease from spreading."
88,6,I hate that movie. I didn't like the movie.
91,6,What do you think about the people who voted against the health order?
9,6,"It is not a joke. It is a joke, a dick move."
14,6,"It seems that some of those people are assuming that the government is involved. I'd like to add that these are people with a very complex and complex condition. But if you get a bad idea for the disease, it's a joke."
17,6,Why are you here? And you don't see the point of a prank. Vaccines are not a crime. The CDC is a monopoly of the federal government.
18,6,It's a prank and the joke is about the president.
23,6,I think the prank is that people think the ACA is for the people and that they are not against repealing it and they are saying it was a prank.
35,6,"I haven't really been around to much of this, but I like the ACA and want to make sure they are working."
40,6,">The only thing I see about the ""masked"" thing is that the masked man is actually a coach. It's not a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke."
41,6,"The whole article is referencing the ACA, and not the fact that the CDC is trying to take down the whole thing."
47,6,Vaccination is the best way to stop AIDS. Please wear masks.
48,6,I have to agree with you: this film is an attempt to get people to see how the President snobs on a sex tape because this guy is wearing it?
50,6,"I'm sure some people will say ""Masked people are dangerous people who want to live in a world where there are only so many people who are shady as well. I think that's a big problem."" But it sounds like the ""Masked people are dangerous men"" ie., ""People who have been around a virus, bitten, and killed,"" and that's a problem that isn't related to AIDS. They have no authority in what is happening and who are responsible for the disease. And the CDC have been reporting it before."""
62,6,"A bunch of people who don't understand the significance of the ACA - I wouldn't even bother to read it, because there are no laws requiring it on the public, and there is absolutely nothing you can do about it. The ""myth"" of having a health care professional go on vacation for an event that doesn't require the public to be vaccinated is one of the few examples."
63,6,"What I'm saying here is that if the game doesn't stop with the use of a mask, the players and players are going to be really incompetent. The president isn't being a troll in that they aren't going to stop the spread of the virus."
65,6,"...I'm not sure you are a joke or a joke. The CDC has been known to provide healthcare to people with HIV, and it's a joke."
75,6,I would imagine the CDC is not only having a problem with the ACA as well as being a problem with their own propaganda in their mandates. And if we had a better system like the ACA we would have done a better job of blocking it.
80,6,>I think it's more a sign of frustration than an excuse. But do I really need to find out. It's up to you to decide if you're a sexist or not. There's absolutely no point in allowing someone to wear a mask
81,6,I'm a big fan of the ACA and it tries to bring down the people who aren't allowed to wear them if they feel uncomfortable.
85,6,A person whose life is changed through getting vaccinated should be given a mask to prevent HIV/AIDS.
88,6,"The CDC is trying to do a job of stopping HIV, TB, and HIV infection, not helping the problem. That is not how it works, but it should."
91,6,"I'm not sure what the real name is. If he's wearing a mask and you're in the public health area with that title you would need to put on the mask. It sounds like a very sexist, immature idea."
9,6,The best way to stop the spread of a virus.
14,6,I read the whole article. I think the best thing to do is to wear it. Vaccinating and keeping people safe is a big red flag in the USA. I'm not a doctor.
17,6,It was an example of the CDC monopoly. It would never have worked in the first place. I'm sure it does.
18,6,That movie is a really good example of how the Obama administration has dealt with the healthcare system.
23,6,"There are a lot of different examples of a prank called ""the ACA""."
35,6,"I mean, that's a really nice line, but that's a joke. I wouldn't get hurt."

41,6,"It's not like we've even discussed a bill yet, because a single person in the ACA's office and president will never make a joke about it."
47,6,The NSA has an ability to be both a force and a pawn. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of AIDS. Please wear masks.
48,6,"It's interesting and entertaining, and it's about a good guy that is trying to get people to agree with him. It's not the CDC's fault for not enforcing anti-virus laws, but the fact that he is snobby is an impressive claim he makes that people would be afraid to wear their mask."
50,6,I don't think people are making fun of the fact that the president has to wear a mask in order to get vaccinated. The CDC is trying to prevent a huge problem that isn't related to AIDS. They have no authority in what is happening and who are responsible for the disease. And the CDC have been reporting it before.
62,6,"I don't know if that's a funny word, but the president seems a little naive about it."
63,6,"'I'm an actual NFL coach at one point, and I don't have a problem with the fact that there are a lot of people playing the NFL, or playing in them at this point, but I can also see that the NFL coaches were the ones putting on the mask and not the players.

14,6,No. You don't need to know what is a prank to have the right to a prank.

48,6,This is the one that the CDC seems to be making the case for.
50,6,"It's a great idea. I'm sure people would laugh at the notion of him being a prankster, but he sounds like he is more concerned about himself than it is that he's a prankster."
62,6,I read this in one of the comments. This guy is the person I wanted to have sex with.
63,6,The jokes in that movie aren't about the CDC. They're about the people in the CDC and their role in the vaccine.
65,6,"No. No, no. The CDC isn't a government, the CDC isn't in charge of everything."
75,6,I'm not saying the ACA is a bad idea. It is a government exception.
80,6,...the problem isn't actually the disease.
81,6,"I've been trying to do this from time to time and haven't gotten around to reading it, but the actual article seems to make no sense because of this. This is not a joke. It's a joke. I think it's a joke."
85,6,"It sounds like there are some serious issues affecting the health care system. If this was a book, it would be a great article to read."
88,6,I was told to go to a party and that the guy with the masks was not going to get the vaccines because his mother was pregnant. I was told to wear the masks because he is sick of the AIDS epidemic and he is not going to get the vaccines because he is sick of the AIDS epidemic.
91,6,They're not in the business of promoting a health care system like the ones here. They're not being a political party to prevent that kind of stuff.
9,6,The book doesn't mention it. It says that it's been put up as a joke.
14,6,It's a joke. It's not a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's not a joke.
17,6,"The CDC is the government's problem, not a joke. The ACA is a prank that the president does not support or support."
18,6,The author is an expert on the US healthcare system. The book is about the healthcare system.
23,6,"We're not trying to make a joke here, this guy is trying to get people to stop the spread of the AIDS epidemic. The ACA is a joke and it's a joke because he's trying to put the ACA in place."
35,6,I feel that the CDC has a lot of power and they do not.
40,6,The CDC is also going after his clone.

48,6,"They could always just ignore the other comments. And you may be right. ""The CDC is doing a horrible job of hiding something from the world."""
50,6,"So if this was a prank about the ACA, and was actually a joke involving a prank on the CDC, then we don't really know what it means. There are a few things in the movie that make people rethink their stances."
62,6,CANNOTANSWER: Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
63,6,> I think the biggest problem with it. The movie isn't really a prank. It seems the President is the victim of a joke in this sub. That's a very interesting idea. The jokes in that movie aren't really meant to be a joke. It seems the President is the victim of a joke in this sub. That's a very interesting idea.
65,6,That's a shit ton of jokes in this sub.
75,6,You're a fool.
80,6,CANNOTANSWER ABOUT THIS CANNOTANSWER
81,6,A lot of things I like to read here are pretty ridiculous.
85,6,The article states that the first prank is a joke about the ACA that the president wants to make about people wearing masks to get vaccinated and help people who have not received the health care they want.
88,6,I don't think you can't say that in the book. This is a joke.
91,6,"No. The idea of a mask to protect a person is really silly. It's about people who wear it. No one can say, ""I'm not sure what the real name is. If he's wearing a mask and you're in the public health area with that title you would need to put on the mask."
9,6,"If they were a joke, then what would they do with the rest of their money? I'd essentially be spending all my money on a book that is a joke."
14,6,CANNOTANSWER'S BAD PARTY:
17,6,"Vaccination is a crime. It's a joke. Vaccination is a crime. Vaccination is a crime. The CDC is the government's problem, not a joke. The ACA is a prank."
18,6,I didn't mean to end OP's 12 list with that line:
23,6,"This is one of those things that the President doesn't want to be in charge of, and that's the kind of prank he wants to do. That's a very good point of view."
35,6,"No wonder they don't think he wants to be a joke, right?"
40,6,"I mean, the CDC sounded like a prank and was probably very skeptical of it because it was a joke."
41,6,"""""I believe that people should be allowed to wear a mask in public. You are going to be sacked and have to leave Georgia."""""
47,6,"It's pretty funny. A bit funny, and very funny."
48,6,Yes. The best thing I can think of is a prank called The Secret to the Conan O'Brien.
50,6,He's making fun of the CDC for not doing it and putting on a mask to prevent the spread of AIDS. The CDC is trying to make the people who are in a rut more responsible and less responsible for that rebuttal
62,6,"""The ACA is based on the ACA. The ACA was a joke. They did say something along the lines of ""You can’t have a vaccinate unless you are vaccinated.'"
63,6,"...I remarked that I'm a little overreacting here, and that it sounds like I've done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest thing a movie ever."
65,6,"A lot of people are going to find out that this is not a joke, and are probably just pointing out that they aren't going to change the way it sounds. They are probably going to go to a doctors office and see how they can get a better treatment for this patient."
75,6,"They should just go to a state convention and have a mask given to them. If it is a big event, that's on the list of upcoming events."
80,6,"'...the problem isn't actually the virus."""
81,6,My dad is the president of the United States. He wears a mask all the time and he thinks it's a joke because it's funny and it's like a joke unless you know how to do it. It's one of the worst things I've ever seen. He's not a prankster. He's not a prankster. He doesn't care about the prank.
85,6,"Isn't it about what he wanted to make out of it, that he just doesn't seem to be trying to make a point - at the moment he's just not interested in getting vaccinated and assuming that people are interested in health care? Does he think he's just an asshole?"
88,6,"That’s the hivemind, that’s how people see hats. It’s a prank."
91,6,I don't think he was wrong.
9,6,Vaccines and STIs are not the same thing. Vaccines and STIs are not the same thing. Vaccines and STIs are not the same thing. Vaccines and STIs are not the same thing. Vaccines and STIs are not the same thing.
14,6,"There are a lot of problems at work in the CDC. The ACA, I'm sure, is a joke. There isn't anything to be joked about in there."
17,6,>The whole thing is a joke.
18,6,I'm not an expert on the healthcare system. I'm an expert on the healthcare system. The book is about the healthcare system.
23,6,"The ACA was a prank because it was against the Constitution, the ACA was against the Health Insurance Act, the health care system, the healthcare reform bill, and so forth."
35,6,Isn't it a joke that a man wears a mask in public? Vaccination is a major problem. It's a joke.
40,6,"I don't think the CDC will change their policies - it's just trying to use them to annoy the people who don't wear them. And even then, they're a joke, it's just a joke."
41,6,"The article is referencing the ACA, which is a joke and a joke. The CDC, CDC and DHS are trying to push the ACA into the'mistake'. It's like he's on the cover of a joke. It's an incredibly bad joke, and it's a joke."
47,6,...and there is no need for a lawyer.
48,6,YES. This is one of those things you have to admit that gets diluted and confusing in a lot of the people that are reading.
50,6,>I don't know what the point of this article is. I'm pretty sure the entire point of this post is that Obama was trying to turn people's perceptions into a way to be more informed about how the president is in the world.
62,6,There is no way to make that a joke. They are a joke and I can't believe the fact that they are being naive.
63,6,"""The Devil Wears a Mask is actually about putting on a mask to stop the spread of a virus."
65,6,The idea that 'The CDC is a prankster' isn't a joke.
75,6,"We don't have a government. I'm not going to be able to get you to buy a mask, but I can try to get you to do that."
80,6,NSA mandates are not the NSA's job.
81,6,I like a lot of things I like to read here.
85,6,"The President's a joke, not a joke, but a joke about the health care system."
88,6,The movie is an awesome example.
91,6,The book is a pretty good example of a good movie I like.
9,6,Vaccines aren't the same thing. Vaccines are not the same thing. Vaccines are not the same thing. Vaccines and STIs are not the same thing. Vaccines and STIs are not the same thing.

The CDC is a government agency.
17,6,"In a video game with the CDC, we see people are laughing about the Obama administration."
18,6,... and what's the title of the article?
23,6,"In the article, there is a joke about how if people don't take the time to put on a mask, and you go to a CDC meeting, they just won't stop people from going. The joke is more about the sexist hat that he is saying is the first step, not the prank he wants to do."
35,6,">We are not allowed to wear a mask, but they must wear the mask in the same area of their country, on a regular basis."""
40,6,The CDC's clone is also part of the ACA.
41,6,"Vaccination isn't a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke, a joke."
47,6,I'd say the joke is sexist. The ACA is a joke. Vaccination is the best way to stop AIDS. Please wear masks.
48,6,''The Secret to the Conan O'Brien''' is about the president's role in preventing the spread of HIV. The ACA addresses the threat of AIDS. There is no way that anyone can get AIDS without wearing a mask. There is no way that anyone can get AIDS without wearing a mask. There is no way that anyone can get AIDS without wearing a mask. There is no way that anyone can get AIDS without wearing a mask. There is no way that anyone can get AIDS without wearing a mask.
50,6,"People have a lot to worry about. The president is probably the one making fun of the government, not the CDC. And the issue is his misinformed comments about the CDC and the CDC aren't the problem. He wants to try and turn people's perceptions into a way to make fun of the President's misinformed shit."
62,6,"""We need to ban vaccinate the public as soon as possible. Vaccinating is about promoting better health. We need to cut down on the amount of stuff you can do that could damage your health."","
63,6,the thing about the syringes is that they are basically made of plastic
65,6,Why don't people think it is a joke and go to the CDC? There's a lot of bad news that the government is getting into trouble for allowing AIDS and getting sick.
75,6,I'm a doctor. I know what I'm doing. I'm a guy. Vaccines are not health issues. Vaccines and STIs are not health issues. Vaccines and STIs are not health issues.
80,6,"I agree with a lot of the comments that they made, but we're also blaming the president for a virus which is extremely dangerous, and I think it's very hard to do a comparison without a mask."
81,6,"I'm going to use a couple of different acronyms here: ""Duckhole""."
85,6,It seems like some of these things are pretty much common in most countries.
88,6,I don't understand why people seem to think that Vaccines aren't a health issue because they don't seem to be. They're not the health issues. They're just health issues. They're not health issues. They're not health issues.
91,6,"In fact, if you get to vote and the majority of the votes don't support the change, you should consider the ""Did I really have to wear a mask to keep a virus away?"" section of the post where [and that's a big problem](http://www.reddit.com/r/r/AsIdIdId) is a good read."
9,6,"I like how the first two sentences are different, ''An important part of the ACA'', and I don't think there's any right or wrong thing to do, but it's the right thing to do."
14,6,"OP, the guy who reads the article is a bit too serious."
17,6,I'm not sure why it is being downvoted. I'm saying that I'm really confused about the actual context and that the article seems like a joke because I'm confused as to the definition of a prank.
18,6,This is a good way to put it.
23,6,I read that the ACA was a prank because it addresses the problem of AIDS. The problem is that the people in the movie did not want to be a joke.
35,6,"It would be hard to argue with your article, given all the red flags and red flags you were referencing."
40,6,"""The CDC and the CDC are making a movie about the ACA and CDC. It's about the CDC, CDC's pranksters, CDC, and CDC."""
41,6,It was a prank.
47,6,"That's what I got from reading the article. The first paragraph is what's coming to mind. That is what was said before, which is, in this context, the subject matter."
48,6,A good person who has a hard time breathing if he hasn't been wearing a mask would not have a problem doing so.
50,6,"I'm sure there is some blaming going on if someone says ""I'm a little worried about being a prankster"" about the CDC, or ""I don't know what it means. I've been told that the CDC and the CDC don't have the authority to stop the spread of AIDS,"" and that the CDC is in the business of getting rid of the CDC. It doesn't make sense that the CDC is being blamed for the AIDS, but you're being mad at how much they're making fun"

63,6,"I can only understand what he means by the phrase ""I think it's really a funny movie"""

80,6,"OP, I have been to a few NSA incidents, but I'm in no way against them. If I was in your shoes I would have been more tolerant."

The people who tell jokes that they like satire and are not getting the real message and don't even care about them are the people who made it. I'm sure that the people who think it's a joke aren't being satire. But, I think it's a joke. That's why I'm going to go through the AMA and find it fascinating."

65,6,"I don't think anyone will be able to find a way to prove that people have AIDS. It's possible to prove that people aren't on a path to it in America. The CDC isn't part of the public health system, and if anything the government isn't doing anything about it."
75,6,You're not a good doctor?
80,6,>I think the NSA is being a bad company. But you can say what you like about it and not make it a sexist joke. They don't have to take it seriously because people don't understand why they are not allowed to wear a mask.
81,6,The article is a ploy to protect people from the AIDS epidemic and has nothing to do with the President's policy of protecting people from them.
85,6,"The idea of a prank is to make the ACA a joke, to not go around promoting it, to make it a prank, and then to make it a prank. The idea is to prevent people from getting HIV in Georgia and to make it a prank - to make it a joke."

14,6,"No one else is reading this, I'm not a fan of the CDC itself."
17,6,So that the CDC's actions and actions to stop the spread of AIDS in a certain country are the opposite of what people say to the government?

If the issue isn't addressed, there will be no discussion of how to end this, including whether or not you can stop the problem."
65,6,The article that argues that they have been making jokes about the CDC is sarcastic.
75,6,Is this a real joke?
80,6,"Is it possible you can wear a mask when the virus is spread? Like, if it's not spreading, then I don't see what it's for. It doesn't seem like the same thing as a virus spreading from people who are not armed enough to know when to wear a mask."

88,6,There's a definite cdc sarcasm and naive point of view.
91,6,"The article was published as ""as a result of a public health issue and a lack of research pointing out what a mask is""."

40,6,You're getting the first two comments right.
41,6,The article is based off of the book. Its very interesting that an ACA is a joke.

47,6,"i'm not a lawyer, and you don't know what I'm talking about."
48,6,"“I think the best thing that can happen is a prank called ""The Secret to the Conan O’Brien"" (https://www.reddit.com/r/Memoirs/)"
50,6,"That is my stance, but I also have some questions about this."
62,6,I know I was in a bad situation but the situation is affecting people who aren't vaccinated. I can't imagine any kind of 'hygienic' policy like this happening now. I'm sure the state will do it for a long time.
63,6,> '[This](http://www.nfl.org/docs/infra/mom-syringe-comments-at-the-time-depressants/) is one of the most craziest examples of a prank that no one has ever done in their entire life putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things I ''Did [Really]
65,6,CANNOTANSWER is going to be the first guy to mention this.
75,6,CANNOTANSWER'S BAD PARTY: Wearing a medical mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
80,6,"I don't get the point of the title, but I've got a pretty good idea of what a mask is."
81,6,"I think that he is being a prank because he has a problem with the CDC, and he knows that the CDC isn't taking care of the health problem."
85,6,"I've never met an Obama administration who isn't willing to support the ACA, but he is a smart man who wants to be President and not be a dick."
88,6,You are not a lawyer.
91,6,"It's not a satire, it's a movie about a joke."
9,6,"[Its a good book. I like it. Its a good book. I'm not trying to make any of the comments in the book, I'm trying to make some of the comments on the internet. I'm not trying to be rude. This is not a joke. The whole idea of having a hat is a good idea. The whole idea that a hat isn't a good idea. The whole idea that a hat isn't a good idea. Isn't a joke?"
14,6,The CDC is a government agency.
17,6,Vaccination is not a joke. It is a crime. It is a prank because it is not a joke.
18,6,No. The ACA is not a joke. The ACA is a joke. The ACA is a joke. The CDC is trying to make it a joke. The ACA is a joke.
23,6,It's a joke about the ACA. It's a joke about the ACA.
35,6,"I think the problem is that people still don't understand the value of the ""what I was wearing"" thing. They only like the 'what I was wearing.''"
40,6,"It's about the CDC, CDC's pranksters, CDC, and CDC."
41,6,Are you sure you have the actual facts?
47,6,>[The book is an excellent joke and the president doesn't have to make jokes about it. It is the best one of the three. The whole ACA thing sounds like a really bad joke.
48,6,">I think the best thing that can happen is a prank called ""The Secret to the Conan O'Brien"" (https://www.afda.gov/repair/security/complaints/nasa_repair_lawyers-female_gov/)"
50,6,"It sounds like this is a rumor, not a fact."
62,6,I’m not a doctor.
63,6,The entire movie is based off the book. They aren't government entities. The movie isn't based on a book.
65,6,I think the joke is not the joke. It is the joke. It is the joke.
75,6,"They are trying to create a monopoly of the ACA to prevent people from acquiring HIV. They don't have an obligation to keep a vaccinated person on their health insurance, and the ACA is a government exception. Isn't that what a prank is?"
80,6,It is possible for you to wear a mask to prevent the spread of a virus. It isn't a crime to allow anyone to use it unless it is against the anti-virus law.
81,6,"''My dad said he didn't like the idea of wearing a mask, but that he thought it was really funny and it's like a joke because it makes him look bad."" ''I'm a big fan of the ACA. It’s not a joke. It’s a joke. It isn't a joke. It isn't a joke. It's a ploy. It is a joke."
85,6,"""""The government is opportunistic about it."
88,6,That's how you get spelled.
91,6,">It's a good example of the type of movie I like.'', ""I love this!"
9,6,"As a matter of fact, it's not a joke. The CDC and CDC are going to take a shot."
14,6,"I'm not going to tell you that you don't like the CDC. What you call the CDC a prank is about how the President's approach to the ACA is being re-examined. The CDC is not a monopoly, but it's an agency. The CDC is a government agency. The CDC is a government agency. The CDC is a government agency. The CDC is a government agency. The CDC is a government agency."
17,6,I'm going to go by the last name and be the snob for one moment. I'm gonna go by the last name.
18,6,"The issue is not about the ACA, but about it."
23,6,"There's also a joke about the Obamacare and the fact that the ACA doesn't help people get HIV/AIDS. The movie is based off the ACA and is called the ACA. It doesn't address AIDS, but a joke."
35,6,"The ACA is a joke - it's not an ethical one, it's an ethical one. It's a prank, a joke. It's a joke. But the ACA is a joke and the government doesn't want to do anything about it."
40,6,"''I would get offended, or if it's a joke. It's a joke, but it has to be a joke to make it a prank.''''(((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((("
41,6,This is the first time this has been said. It was about a joke.
47,6,I can tell you from reading it that it's a joke.
48,6,So you're saying that's the end of the world?
50,6,"CANNOTANSWER: ""(The CDC has been reporting it to the government to stop the spread of a virus, they have not done it yet.'](http://www.flc.org/cds/index.html) Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of a virus."
62,6,"I don't see how I could possibly be a part of the conversation, unless a couple of things occur in the same sentence:"
63,6,"In a nutshell, I love to joke about a lot of things. If the CDC actually did something to stop the spread of the AIDS, the problem would just be that people are going to think you are a prankster. A person is not supposed to put on a mask, it just doesn't seem to be a good idea to do it, and is likely not a good idea if they don't revert to that attitude. The CDC and their media is not good enough to a good enough way to prevent the AIDS."
65,6,"People with HIV are not at risk. A mask is just a joke. Despite the obvious claims that the CDC is involved, there is still a lot of bad news that they aren't going to do something about the ACA. I don't think it's an inappropriate joke. It's a joke. The only joke I can think of that argues against is the fact that they aren't doing anything about it."
75,6,"""The CDC is trying to make it illegal for Americans to have a vaccine."
80,6,The president is trying to stop the spread of AIDS. The CDC is not going to allow people to use the mask to prevent AIDS. The NSA is not going to have a role in preventing HIV. The president is trying to prevent AIDS. The CDC is not going to help prevent it. The president has to get out and get people to do it. They are going to use it to get people to do it in the event the people who aren't doing it to get the virus to actually stop AIDS.
81,6,CANNOTANSWER: It’s a prank. It’s a joke.
85,6,"Yes, that's a prank. I would say a prank, no prank. But I would also say that if you think the government should be promoting it, you're in an unfortunate position to think that the current system is ineffective."
88,6,"The point here isn't actually that vaccines are health issues, but that they are. It's that the government is not going to do anything to stop the spread of the virus. They are not health issues. Vaccines are not health issues. They are not health issues. It is the government who is trying to shut people down."
91,6,The first section is an example of the type of movie that's about the Obama administration. It says the Obama administration is attempting to do a bad job of maintaining a government with no purpose.
