101,24,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
24,13,... oh my god. I hope the government will stop making it such a horrible thing.

24,23,Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of a virus.
25,24,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
35,24,"No one wants to talk about that, but people want to talk about it, and then you can get mad about it too."
38,24,It is not that dumb. I love playing at the game and the coach said he can hardly keep up with a little bit of the play
59,24,if there s not a mask on people I m going to go out and make sure i don't get a virus I'll have to wear a mask. i don't think that makes any sense in this context.
62,24,You have nothing to be hated for putting on your mask - and you do you want to wear your mask - and you are not doing it if you are not sick - and you are not going to be able to keep your shit together - and you do not want to get mad at the same time - and if the state doesn't have any mandates you can hate you for wanting to take a step back - it's a pretty hard thing to do. Getting a mask is not just for a good reason
81,24,"If you don't wear a mask when you travel, you don't have to have it on."
84,24,We do it because i know we need to. If you can't even come to a game and try to win a game you can't go to a game and get a helmet. I believe if you don't wear a mask then I would go to the games with my team. I'm sure the coaches can't do much besides get tripped by the players on the field and the coach will feel bad about it.
85,24,It's about the only one in the US wearing a mask.
86,24,Taking off your mask and putting on a mask is one of the dumbest things things i have ever done in my entire life and i have done a lot of dumb things how does the mask make his breath come out of the back of his head i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops.

24,23,It's not that dumb. It's stupid.
25,24,I ain tinker with the facts.
35,24,"...and if he's not wearing his mask in public, what's the problem?"
38,24,I think you are right about that. People have had a great time.
59,24,> It's just a nitpick about getting vaccinated. Is wearing a mask the same as not wearing a mask to get a virus?
62,24,This is the only way to stop a shitstorm.
81,24,"> If you don't wear a mask when you travel, you don't have to have it on."
84,24,Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of a virus. Please wear masks.
85,24,It is really the only one in the country without a mask.
86,24,"""What about the other trump supporters? Who are those people who make a point of wearing their masks so they don't have to be physically assaulted and taken to the urinals for treatment, or are they merely effected by the fact that they did not get a helmet for being outside while standing near people? Is this something that a mask doesn't allow for? If so why are they not allowed to wear them?"""
89,24,He was fucking the restaraunt
93,24,"I'm very interested in how this can be used to get the government to do this. I've read a lot of witty and well written pieces of history, and some really interesting things, but I would not have a problem with a mask if I weren't a person, and I'm not against the mandates or the ones the government can support. I'm not against the mandates, but I think it would make for a very good campaign to try to use this in the long run. I believe it's a bit of a lot of people"
101,24,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
24,13,A mask will protect you from the virus from the health workers in the country and from other harmful bacteria (like shingles) if it isn't exposed to the correct vaccines. They are the only people in the country with a health care system that does not provide the necessary safety gear.
24,21,I'm not saying it isn't dumb. It's not that dumb. It's stupid. I'm saying it is. I'm not asking you to come up with any rational rational explanation.
24,23,You're an idiot. You're a dumbass.
25,24,"Well, 'what a joke!'."
35,24,"You said you were afraid of something. It's a nirvana, not a tampon. A mask isn't a vaccine. It's a vaccination."
38,24,I don't know the actual dissent but if you are using that phrase for the benefit of other people you are not missing anything.
59,24,"No. But, you've got it in the right place."
62,24,"It's not an issue to wear a mask, it's not an issue to take care of yourself and others. People with virus-sore tend to have more sensitivity to illness."
81,24,"When a president takes advantage of people's natural instincts he just makes it out to be ""fucking crazy"", and I don't see how that's going to be anything but a little bit of a joke."
84,24,"I don't understand the politics. What are you talking about? What's the problem? Why would a coach not wear a mask, or even a helmet if that is the case?"
85,24,The government has been helping stop the spread of a virus since the 1700s. They do not support the new system.
86,24,The truth about the president being a shady asshole is that he is a shady asshole. The president does not need to wear a mask because he is not wearing a mask.
89,24,Wearing a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i have done in my entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask
93,24,The President is opportunistic. I think they are a good group and the people have a reason to be against the ACA.
101,24,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
24,13,Vaccinating people against shingles is a bit different from a nirvana vaccine and a flu vaccine.
24,21,Putting on a mask is one of the dumbest things things I've ever done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask.
24,23,What about the other trump supporters?
25,24,"I'd like to say something along the lines of ""I wear a mask every time someone else wants to wear a mask."" It's like a pretty normal thing to do. They can't just just put it on or wear it on, it's just a way to get people to put on a mask and then it goes on the bus to the airport and take it to the government for a medical inspection. You have to take a helmet on a VERY small part of your face, and wear a mask on your head if you're worried about your "
35,24,"He's getting a retcon at the hospital. It's a lie that the CDC should have not done anything about it, which I believe is what's causing the problem."
38,24,"This is not an issue in the US, this is just a problem here. It's not about preventing the spread of a virus. It's about helping prevent the spread of a virus."
59,24,"You think you're being stupid? Because a lot of people who are allergic to HIV don't seem to know how to put on a mask, unless the doctor has a medical opinion. And if it's not a mask, then you probably shouldn't wear a mask because you're going to get sick. But if you're not going to tell people you should, I'm going to ask them."
62,24,"A lot of people don't think that the government is requiring a mask, especially if it's about protecting the public from the spread of a virus. It's the only way to stop this disease. It's about promoting better health. You're not being insulted for having a mask."
81,24,"Honestly, I wouldn't go to jail for anything more than going to the CDC to get shot."
84,24,The team needs to resign. Because it's one of the best jobs for our country to have a professional head coach. It's really important for their coach to be able to do his job well.
85,24,"Vaccination of people in Georgia has nothing to do with exposing people to HIV. If someone does this then the government isn't doing enough to stop that. This doesn't help the virus spread, that's more important than the other one."
86,24,Is it okay for the president to wear a mask?
89,24,Wearing a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i have done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask
93,24,"You want to know what the ""masked person"" would be like in your life? The one with the mask?"
101,24,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
24,13,[I don't understand the difference between Vaccinating people and vaccinating against the spread of the virus.
24,21,"This is the worlds largest vaccine to date. It's already spread across the world. This is a problem with the government. And the people who care about this aren't even that involved in the current system, they are more concerned about what they can do to stop it."
24,23,i raped a guy once. i told him he deserved it
25,24,"I know it's a joke, but this is my opinion. It was not in any way endorsed by the CDC, it was a fact-check."
35,24,">I'm sorry he didn't vote against it, what is the state bringing to the debate."
38,24,"Assuming the vaccine doesn't prevent any diseases, they should not be doing anything to stop it. They're just the people using them to prevent it."
59,24,My cousin is allergic to HIV. I can't find a doctor in the US who has a doctor that can prescribe them to me. I know that's a nitpick and I know that if I'm allergic to a virus I would have to put on a mask but I can't seem to find one. It's just the fact that I can't'make sure I don't get a virus' and it's not a nitpick.
62,24,I had an infection. I was putting it out as fast as possible. I was too numb to it. I was going to put on a mask. But I didn't know it's required on my shirt. I was in an infection that needed a vaccination and was in a medical emergency.
81,24,'I'm a guy' and the guy has a terrible cough.
84,24, I'm a coach and I wear a mask a lot. The guy is saying it because he can't really fight the flu.
85,24,I think if you don't have a mask a lot of people are going to try and do it. I'd say get one if you need a mask and you will be fine.
86,24,It was written by a troll who also knows the subject.
89,24,Isn't it one of the dumbest things you've done in your entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask?
93,24,"The first sentence I heard was ""I don't think i'll catch the cough i already had it i'm against them cuz they ruin the economy get people fired and people should be able to choose to choose to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force"""
101,24,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
24,13,It's so sad to hear that our health care system is overreacting and the people who do it will continue to retaliate in the slightest. But I think a lot of people will do it.
24,21,No wonder there are no federal vaccine laws in Georgia – this is a matter of laws.
24,23,That's because you were wearing a mask.
25,24,"CANNOTANSWER (r-cdc): The ACA makes it illegal to wear a mask. You could ask him to explain how the mask works. Then what's the point of that? If he's going to do that, how will he ever feel about it?"
35,24,"A good thing about a good thing about the ACA, but not because it's a big thing."
38,24,I think it's funny how people comment on it because it's an incredibly ignorant and disconcerting idea.
59,24,"They are trying to cover it up by calling it ""I'm allergic to HIV"" (because I hate it)."
62,24,My son was born in that region and his family did it for him.
81,24,That is very misleading and it is very inappropriate for them to wear their masks.
84,24,"""The guy is saying it because he can't really fight the flu. They're going to stop them. Unless they just go out and get some sick people."""
85,24,"Vaccination is a great idea, but it's not what it was meant to be. The only thing that can be done about it is to put it on."
86,24,Taking off your mask and putting on a mask is one of the dumbest things things i have ever done in my entire life and i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops.
89,24,So you've been in the US for a long time.
93,24,So how can the government have a problem with the ACA?
101,24,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
24,13,I don't think people are trying to get around a government retaliation against a vaccine in the US.
24,21,"As someone who has lived in Georgia, this was a really interesting debate, and it's important to not use too much of it. The ACA is a stupid idea, and the people who do it will still retaliate. The article seems to say that some of these folks are more ill-equipped to make the effort to fight the virus, and they need a way to do that in order to gain political power."
24,23,So we know we need to rethink our current health care system?
25,24,"Having a mask is one thing, it's another."
35,24,"OP, if you want to know more about the ACA, there are also a lot of other stuff about it like the CDC. You might be interested in learning about the CDC's support of vaccines '."
38,24,"This is one of the few times I really thought I had read about the problem of HIV/AIDS, not the problem of putting on a mask. I did a bit of looking at some photos from a few years ago, and I realized that the question isn't about HIV, it's about helping prevent that disease. The problem is the stigma. I'm sure it's not all about being a dick, but in a way, it's a good idea to show it off."
59,24,I can't find a doctor in the US who has a medical opinion.
62,24,A bunch of people who are a bit crazy because of the ACA and just want to be a good citizen and have a conversation with them?
81,24,"It's been a long time since I saw this and I didn't realize how terrible it was until I saw this movie. I did, however, like a man."
84,24,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. No, they are referring to the president as a coach."
85,24,"Vaccination is a great idea, but it's not what it was meant to be."
86,24,It sounds like that guy's attitude has changed since then. I don't think it's an example of what he's saying but as I know it's not.
89,24,I saw this movie when I was in grade school. I think it's great that you're thinking of a 'dumb joke'. You're just thinking about why he wore the mask. I think it's great that you're thinking of a 'dumb joke'. I can't believe a person is going through a restaraunt and a person is walking in there. I'm pretty sure a lot of people aren't actually using the word sex in their sentences.
93,24,"I'm not really sure who is describing the president, but the fact that the president is trying to change the health care system."
101,24,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
24,13,I can't believe that a person is going through a restaraunt and a person is walking in there.
24,21,[(Person who defended the ACA) i spelled it 'Snake a mask to walk through restaraunt
24,23,"So you're saying ""I was not smart enough to do that, but I am not going to get any vaccine for a month now, because I am so sick."" /r/reflection"
25,24,>You could ask him to explain how the mask works. Then what's the point of that?
35,24,I think I figured out the meaning of the whole thing.
38,24,"The problem is that if he can't stop wearing it, he wouldn't be able to. He would be the only one who would be able to get a virus. The big issue is not ""preventing the spread of the virus."" He's just making a joke."
59,24,The NSA can't fuck out of the government.
62,24,">It's not an issue to wear a mask, it's just that he's wearing a mask, because he feels like he's 'behaving badly' he shouldn't be able to see his breathing better."
81,24,"I'm going to see the movie I'm a man: My friend and I did something similar. I was in my room and the whole thing was a shitshow. I'm going to see the movie I'm a man: My friend and I did something similar. I was in my room and the whole thing was a shitshow, and everyone was super nice and chatty. I'm a guy so I can help. And as a man, I wear my mask when I am in public."
84,24,You can't stop the spread of HIV by wearing a mask. It's not the first time the President has done so. It's the first time the president has done so.
85,24,"I'm really... sorry, but I was a bit disappointed that you guys are discussing this in the ""President's voice"". The actual story is that if you go to Georgia without a mask, you see what a horrible virus it is: ""...If you don't have a mask, a lot of people are going to try and do it."" (I'm sorry, but that's not the whole point of the article)"
86,24,"There's a lot to be said here regarding how doctors are supposed to protect people with facial expressions. They would put on a mask to help prevent infection, and they would put on a mask to avoid people from getting sick."
89,24,"I was like, ""Oh if you said something like that I wouldn't have said anything about a mask. I would be like, 'Well shit it's a good thing i don't like the way it's told, but it's a good idea to say it. "" ""Feel like a baby, but without an epidural. I feel like that's a lot of people's work. The whole idea of a hammer blazing all over your face is a good idea."""
93,24,You're making the wrong assumption?
101,24,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
24,13,"This is an example of a poor joke. A doctor is not supposed to tell you that ""he is in fact trying to get around this government retaliation."""
24,21,It is not a stupid idea. But it is a very good idea. He has a right to wear a mask to protect himself and to fight the virus.
24,23,It seems like a lot of people haven't really noticed the whole issue.
25,24,> he needs to be a more serious and responsible person and he has the right to be a good leader if he wants to live the life of his dreams.
35,24,I think that he has been doing his job because he thinks he's being a fucking idiot.
38,24,>The biggest thing is the stigma - he can't stop wearing it. I would be concerned if he just wore it because he knew he wasn't doing enough to not get the message across.
59,24,The NSA fucked up the CIA by bringing in an infamous virus-related virus based on the viral ape.
62,24,"""Since he was born in that region and his family did it for him, I've been trying to take care of myself. I've learned that having a mask is a terrible idea for both of us."
81,24,I've read the article. The title suggests he is against the rules and his post is probably a good example of it.
84,24,"I've learned that there's a difference between wearing a mask and not wearing a helmet when the guy isn't a coach. It's about a particular piece of the body, rather than the vaccine itself."
85,24,The fact that I don't like it makes me feel a little cheated on and I actually do have a tv camera in Georgia.
86,24,"I'd like to clarify: if a person is saying putting on a mask is to prevent the spread of a virus, you need to be able to say what that is."
89,24,"I don't have a problem with people putting on masks, I just find the idea of them making a funny joke more and more relevant."
93,24,"CANNOTANSWER, if that is the case. You're making the wrong assumption. I can't speak for everyone, but this guy is a big ass tyrant who wants to be on the right side of things. Why did you write the article? It's not that easy to come up with an actual answer. The guy is not an idiot, the whole article is about him trying to change the health care system."
101,24,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.

35,24,>I think that he has been doing his job because he thinks he's being a fucking idiot.
38,24,a big part of it is why they have to wear a mask all the time. i think its funny how people respond because they think it's a joke.
59,24,I don't think a lot of people in the US think wearing a mask makes them sick because they're allergic to HIV.
62,24,"I think the point of the ACA is to have a 'protective health care program' in place, and the people doing it. Hopefully this post's message is being interpreted correctly, and that's all they're asking for."
81,24,No. He's going to need a mask or a hat in the public eye.
84,24,I'm a federal aide. And the CDC doesn't want to allow such a thing.
85,24,"I was a part of the group that said it was an excellent movie, and I was very surprised that I got the link."
86,24,I think it's not necessary to be a troll and therefore not an opportunist to go out on a limb and not actually read it - but I don't think the president would want to wear a mask.

24,23,"I see the danger in this. I don't think it's wrong, he's just a troll trying to play the blame game."
25,24,I'm a big fan of the ACA. I don't see what the problem is.
35,24,There's no way to keep up with all the bad news. The CDC is going to use a mask in public to make it less safe and more effective.
38,24,I don't think it's that a dick is not a joke. It's a joke.
59,24,It is an interesting story about the NSA and it is part of the anti-virus measures.
62,24,"I think the point of the ACA is to have a 'protective health care program' in place, and the people doing it. Hopefully this post's message is being interpreted correctly, and that's all they're asking for."

85,24,What is the point of putting on a mask?
86,24,Having a mask would help prevent people from getting shot. Having a mask can prevent people from getting the AIDS. But the problem with the mask is that people who wear it don't know how to walk because they think it's bad.

81,24,I can’t think of a single day in the life of the president that would feel more secure if he wore the hat in public than if he hadn’t.
84,24,"I don't see any problems with pranksters wearing masks. If they are supposed to, they are correct."
85,24,You are a real man. I love the one from my mom. It's all I know. It's a joke.
86,24,I don't think a mask is a joke at all.
89,24,I'm not sarcastic.
93,24,"the ACA, because the president is a tyrant. i'm not sure who is describing the ACA, but the opportunist who wrote the article has no idea what he is talking about, but i think he may be talking about something important"
101,24,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
24,13,This is a joke based on the fact that there is no such thing as a 'dick joke'.
24,21,"As someone who is a big fan of the ACA and the government, I am more concerned about the fucking government getting on top of it than the people who will wear a mask. This is what I'm saying."
24,23,The CDC and the Obamacare administration have been a cliche since 2010. The President has shown he is capable of taking risks with his health and his ability to prevent or prevent AIDS.
25,24,a lot of people have come to accept the existence of a state government. This is a huge red flag. The fact that someone can be a troll is a red flag. There are plenty of things people can do.
35,24,If I had a problem with you I'd be so upset.
38,24,"The CDC, the NFL, and the US have all put together a ""playbook"" based on a classic book."
59,24,The ACA and vaccines are different things. Some of them are not necessary to prevent HIV. It's also not good for the environment or healthcare.
62,24,"The CDC doesn't have the right to require a mask to protect itself and to prevent people from entering the country. It does, however, not make it any more a joke."
81,24,"As long as you don't have the fear of being shot and have a mask on, then it is the best option to get shot."
84,24,"[NAME] is a medical expert who specializes in the diagnosis of HIV/AIDS, but is a doctor. His main job is the vaccine. His main job is to prevent the spread of HIV."
85,24,"If this wasn't for a joke like this, I'd be upset about a lot of things going on in Georgia."
86,24,"That was a joke. He has a mask and he's probably wearing it to avoid being physically assaulted, which is why he is not allowed to wear it. He seems to have a resentment toward his resentment toward the president."
89,24,"I can't really say that. I just mean that people who aren't able to use sarcasm aren't actually comfortable with using a mask in their sentences, if they put a hat on, the whole idea of them making a prank with the hat isn't funny, it's a joke."
93,24,"I'm not anti-Semitic, and I'm not against the ACA."
101,24,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
24,13,I don't know why they would want to be sarcastic if they didn't write it if they didn't need to.
24,21,"""Wearing a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when you get to your table is one of the dumbest things things I have ever done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask."""
24,23,"I don't think the problem lies with whether it's a joke, the lack of a solution, or the failure of the ACA. I just think it's really a prank."
25,24,"“ I am in my 30’s and I’m not a fan of the ACA. I want to be a good leader. If people don’t care about their views, I will quit voting for the ACA.”"
35,24,The article is in part about the CDC being critical of the government.
38,24,"You said ""a joke. I'm hoping we can stop this prank in more articles if we could. It's a joke""?"
59,24,Why do people do that in a place like New York that has the CDC?
62,24,"It's not a joke, it's a joke."
81,24,You've just said something.
84,24,"Vaccination is a good way to ward off HIV, but does not help prevent the spread of the virus."
85,24,I'm in a state that a lot of people don't understand what the ACA is supposed to accomplish. I'm so sad because a lot of people can't afford a mask and there are people that can't afford it. But that's not what this article is about.
86,24,">The problem is people not wearing a mask, and they have no idea what a prank is, especially when people wear it."
89,24,>I don't really know why people would put on a mask.
93,24,"""The president is a tyrant who wants to get rid of anything because he can't do anything that is supposed to stop the spread of AIDS."""

24,21,">I don't think the problem lies with whether it's a joke, the lack of a solution, or the failure of the ACA. I just think it's really a joke."
24,23,You are a troll. You are not being a joke. I am a joke.
25,24,I'm sorry. There's a lot of information in the article. I'm not sure which one of those shit is a joke.
35,24,You're a very serious and naive person.
38,24,"That's pretty much what happens when people think the president is ""just a prick."" It is what happens when people are a prick, assuming it's not about the virus."
59,24,You have no idea how long this is going on.
62,24,"""It's not an issue to wear a mask, it's just that he's wearing a mask because he feels like a dick or because he doesn't know what a mask is or isn't comfortable."""
81,24,'We need to start a new generation of coaches that are able to understand the consequences of what they are doing.
84,24,"i think this is a prank, it's a very serious and serious issue. i know the whole thing is a big deal, but i haven't heard it."
85,24,The point of putting on a mask is that you do not need one for your everyday life. That's all.
86,24,That's why he doesn't wear a mask. Because he's a troll.
89,24,A lot of people wear masks because they aren't comfortable with it.
93,24,"You can tell me, as the President, that the President is the one who wants the ACA repeal, not the president of the US. The government is in power."
101,24,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
24,13,"I'm really looking forward to seeing the full post by sen. joey, and it's pretty clear that you have a hard time understanding the meaning of sen. joey."
24,21,"So, a rehashing of the ACA was made so they can start getting more of the narcotics they were using and retaliating to the president's own cause."
24,23,"Well yeah the govt and government are doing their part, but the idea of a prank about a mask is just wrong. Vaccinating a guy doesn't just prevent AIDS. It does prevent the spread of the virus. You just have to take a little bit of your time to get it off if you are in a state where a lot of people can't afford a mask. If I wore a mask I wouldn't be able to afford it and wouldn't have a chance."
25,24,"This article is a joke. The only joke is ""I have never read that book,"" and the actual sarcastic stuff is really just a shit about the problem."
35,24,You have a problem with what the CDC said here.
38,24,"I thought the title was funny, not a joke. I thought it was a joke. It's the same thing with a joke."
59,24,I don't know why they would say this in a non-judgemental way.
62,24,CANNOTANSWER:
81,24,"He's a joke if he doesn't go to jail for wearing it. The point of the film was to make people want to fight a disease... and to use the word 'insecurity' in any manner possible - but he did get shot because he's not a guy and didn't have to wear a mask to fight the AIDS epidemic, and it was a prank."
84,24,That's just one of those ad hominem ideas you may be trying to apply here.
85,24,It's not about the ACA. It's about the people and the people that do it.
86,24,I can't believe I got to this point in a week of yelling at an old friend for tripping on the phone.
89,24,It sounds like a prank. People are wearing it to get people to come out of the restaraunt and try to avoid being shit. So basically they are causing it. And it sounds like it's a joke - in the context of prank.
93,24,"I'm pretty sure the phrase ""you can tell me, as the President, that the President is the one who wants the ACA repeal, not the president of the US. The government is in power."""
101,24,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
24,13,Vaccinating a guy does not prevent the spread of AIDS.
24,21,"I think it's interesting that the article is suggesting that people who want to fight AIDS can be seen as a prank, but that it isn't a joke. You could argue that if you wear a mask, that the person is a prank and the person that thinks it's a joke, because they're not comfortable with it. Then you could argue that they can't be seen as a prank if they don't get it."
24,23,"""It sounds like a lot of people haven't really noticed the whole issue."""
25,24,"He didn't even read the book, it's his opinion that was irrelevant."
35,24,"If the CDC doesn't agree with that, the Obama administration and the CDC have to do it."
38,24,"This is the first time the US has given a prank about the administration. The CDC is the biggest joke in the US, but the gov't wants to give people a prank about it."
59,24,You know this is pretty clear..
62,24,"CANNOTANSWER: The ACA isn't a joke, it's just a joke."
81,24,>The president was just going to say that hats and masks are sexist and sexist jokes. It's a joke.
84,24,"Well, it's not really a prank, but it's a joke."
85,24,The problem is that people wearing a mask in the US don't know how to walk because they think it's bad. The problem with a mask is that the people wearing it don't actually know how to walk because they think it's bad. The problem with a mask is that you don't need a mask for your everyday life.
86,24,That would be the biggest problem I see.
89,24,It's just a prank if you're uncomfortable with a hat.
93,24,Isn't Obamacare the reason you are being so critical of his policies?
101,24,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
24,13,You have nothing to worry about. It's a prank.
24,21,"[In my book, he talks about the ACA in an attempt to justify the lack of a government mandate on HIV. He also talks about the lack of a mandate on HIV that was deemed necessary by the ACA. [It's not the ACA, it's not the ACA, a joke."
24,23,Vaccinate a guy and get vaccinated. It’s a joke.
25,24,You're being a prankster. 'The ACA' is not a joke.
35,24,"And it's a joke. The CDC does not like the ACA, they just want to keep it the way it is."
38,24,"I can't remember what I thought, but I do remember reading an article that said that the CDC and the NFL put together a ""playbook"" about a viral AIDS virus, which I suspect portrayed a prank. They said they were going to get rid of the ACA so that the CDC and the NFL wouldn't have to help them do what they did in order to prevent that."
59,24,I'd also say a little bit of a joke here:
62,24,ACA is a joke. It has nothing to do with the ACA.
81,24,Why are people so mad at me when I can't believe it?
84,24,">I feel like this is a prank, but I don't like them trying to make the public sector more important. It has been around for about 2 years."
85,24,"If he could afford a mask, why do people wear it? Do people do it?"
86,24,You're going to have to be the one who read the article. You aren't arguing whether it is a prank or not.
89,24,You are not a prankster. There is a prank on the internet every day that is intended to be funny for an audience. It is a prank in that all of the people in the world aren't in the same place in this sense.
93,24,You are an idiot for putting out this article.
101,24,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
24,13,"""Senate's budget isn't enough for the vaccine to last. You're doing a great job. I can't see my bill to have a law stating that you can get a free pass to the President. I want you to make a bill that will cover my personal and professional expenses. I don't think I can do any work on the budget."""
24,21,i'm not saying it isn't dumb. It's stupid. I'm saying it is. I'm not asking you to come up with any rational rational explanation.
24,23,Vaccinating a man and getting vaccinated is a prank that is a joke because the President has failed to protect AIDS.
25,24,A big part of this is that people have come to accept that the government is not a good solution and are doing it to prevent the spread of the virus.
35,24,">The CDC does not like the ACA, they just want to keep it the way it is."
38,24,"The President is trying to do things to help the world to stop the ACA, so why did the President ask the CDC for the help of that."
59,24,This is a comedy in which everyone is making jokes about the federal government... The fact that the article is talking about the ACA and vaccines does not seem to be very relevant.
62,24,"Are you a Republican, a Democrat, a Democrat? The Republican party, a Democrat, a Democrat, a Republican, a Democrat, a Democrat and a Republican."
81,24,If a President wears his mask in public I'm talking about people putting it on for fear of being shot.
84,24,"It seems to me like if this coach's stance is that the ACA is a joke, he isn't really in the position of being a prankster, but the CDC and his own administration have no interest in preventing it."
85,24,"In the end, they aren't responsible for their own actions, which is why they aren't responsible for them. If you want to be the anti-prankster, you need to read what the article's about."
86,24,Because wearing a mask isn't really a prank. Having a mask makes your body more prone to infection and also to the spread of AIDS - no more tripping on the phone.
89,24,That is a very serious prank that can be quite dickish.
93,24,They're not actually talking about the President. They're talking about the president's vehement opposition to the ACA repeal and repeal.
101,24,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
24,13,"There's a LOT of dick jokes on the internet, but the point stands. The point is to make it interesting and make people laugh. Whether or not the president's stance is that he doesn't care about protecting AIDS, is irrelevant and that's a good thing."
24,21,"""I think that putting on a mask is one of the dumbest things things I have ever done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask. I'm not saying it's dumb. But it is. I'm saying it is. I'm not asking you to come up with any rational rational explanation."""
24,23,"I'm not a politician, but if I was a politician, I wouldn't have worn a mask for a year."
25,24,The ACA makes it illegal to wear a mask in the US. It is one of the most extreme and ridiculous policies of any country. It is just too big a deal.
35,24,"""I have no idea who is in office anymore,"""
38,24,"Those aren't the same things as a joke. ''It is a joke'', 'They are just the people using them to prevent the spread of the virus.

85,24,"The issue is if people can't get vaccinated, then they are not responsible for it."

93,24,I'm not trying to say that the Obamacare repeal is any good. I just don't think it will work. Isn't it going to go downhill from there?
101,24,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
24,13,Vaccinating the President does not prevent the spread of AIDS.
24,21,The ACA repeal is an absolutely stupid idea.
24,23,This is a joke that will be voted on in the next year or so. This is going to come down to the issue of the president's stance on the ACA being a joke.
25,24,"What does your comment mean? ""... you're being a prankster. """
35,24,"The CDC is a joke, not a joke."
38,24,I don't think I'm getting the point of this.

81,24,I don't think it is a prank. That is actually the actual point of the article.
84,24,"It's also an interesting fact that people often say ""I don't see any problems with pranksters wearing masks"". The fact that they're calling them ""pranksters"" is the most interesting."
85,24,Vaccination is not a good idea. It is not what it was meant to be. The issue is what people wearing it are actually saying.

24,13,"The first paragraph is probably a joke but based on what someone says is a joke, which I am sure is a joke, is what it is. It isn't a joke at all, it's an obnoxious and misleading joke, a blatant fraud. I am just saying it's not what people like to write about. It's basically an idiocy that goes into a whole new direction: if it's not a joke then you are doing it wrong, but it's a joke. I'm just saying"

38,24,The CDC is not the one supplying the data for the ACA's elimination. The ACA is not a joke. This is the one that a president can't stop saying. I think they should just let the joke go and try and stop the ACA.

89,24,If you don't like the way the sarcasm goes but it does bother me. I think that's just how it is.
93,24,If you aren't against the ACA then you should really read this article first. It is really not about the ACA and what its intent was. It is about the repeal. The repeal is not a law that is based on the ACA.

84,24,We don't have to go to the games. It's the national game.
85,24,I don't think putting on a mask is a good idea. You don't need a mask for everyday life. You need a mask for everyday life. You need a mask for everyday life.
86,24,OP's comment is one of the most relevant and interesting sections of a book. The first part of this article is about the current ACA. The other part is that we have had to learn to read the articles by multiple people. So it's hard for me to get the full text.
89,24,I would say that the whole idea of a'sarcasm' being a joke isn't that funny. I do think that's a good idea to say. I don't really know why people would wear a hat to stop people from being able to walk.

81,24,CANNOTANSWER:
84,24,"They have no interest in doing it, they don't want to make it a prank."
85,24,Vaccination is the way of the future. You can't afford to buy a mask and get the virus out.
86,24,"The ACA was passed for the purpose of preventing the spread of HIV, which is a joke."

93,24,"I've only ever been in a witty, witty, and well written section of the country where a single politician has attempted to troll the public. I do know that you can't say for sure who exactly is behind this post, but it's kind of a little tame."

62,24,The ACA doesn't change the fact that the CDC is a monopoly on the federal government.

I don't think it's a prank, it's a joke. I think it's an 'advertising' prank. The ACA is a prank that the government is trying to force on the people. It's a joke."

24,21,The ACA was passed for the purpose of preventing the spread of the virus.
24,23,The author wrote a chapter that goes from 'I'm a troll' to 'I'm not a joke'.
25,24,"The problem with the ACA is that it allows people to be free to go through with their lives without having to wear a mask. In order to prevent the spread of the disease in this country you need to have the right to stay in that area, that way you can be free to go to the doctors and get a prescription."
35,24,"The article doesn't mention ""An ACA retcon is only one part of the ACA, but I don't like the other parts of it, because the ACA isn't a joke. The ACA is a joke. It's a joke.

38,24,"The CDC sucks. They're going to get rid of it. The ACA isn't going to be a joke, but it's going to be a prank."

81,24,"A man needs to wear his mask in the public eye, but also need to make a mask for the public eye, as it is a form of social security, to get in touch with other people and get tested for HIV.

84,24,I am going to be an atheist and call a coach a prankster.
85,24,This a good way of addressing a common problem:
86,24,"The whole ""prankster"" thing is a joke, that's why it was written. I've never heard of it, but it sounds like a pretty good one."
89,24,"I had to read an article on youtube about this and I thought it was funny. I thought it was funny, and so I took it up on it. But I thought it was a good idea and the article was kind of boring. I haven't done that stuff in a very long time."
93,24,"""The ACA repeal is based on the ACA."""
101,24,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
24,13,That is what a prank is.
24,21,"The word prank is a joke, but it's not an anti-war joke. It's a joke. It's a joke."
24,23,So here's what I came to say:
25,24,"What does a mask actually say about it? Do you have a picture of it? I like to wear a mask, but it doesn’t do the trick."
35,24,This isn't a joke. It's a joke.

101,24,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
24,13,I think the reason this was said was because some of the jokes were not relevant to the topic.
24,21,It's a joke. The ACA is a joke.
24,23,"The ACA was designed to help prevent the spread of HIV in the United States, while addressing a common problem. A prankster in this situation probably has the opposite idea. The ACA is the least effective cure."

62,24,"You are right about what's going on here. This is not about the ACA, it's about the people vaccinating them.
