89,43,putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i ve ever done in my entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things
45,43,This seems to be a trend in the US
58,43,So do you know what kind of helmet is worn by a team?
62,43,> i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask
69,43,"I'm a liar - I was actually just in that scene. i would feel like the person who wore his mask to protect himself, especially if it was a trump thing."
81,43,"I'm going to go with you, because I'm going to be the shit the government uses."
89,43,"A bit funny, the woman who wears a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when she gets to her table is one of the dumbest things that i ve done in her entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when she gets to her table is one of the dumbest things things i ve done in her entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things"
45,43,"There is a lot of confusion about what a mask is, but that does not mean it's part of the measures deployed by the government. It could also be used to stop the spread of a virus."
58,43,"""If I were president i'd have no problem at all in the future. Oh man you should come to Georgia to get vaccinated, you can also wear a mask to walk through public restrooms and make a noise to make sure you are breathing through a mask You don't have to wear a mask for an American. They have a mask on their hands and it is soooooo contagious."
62,43,"The first thing you do is read it. You are asking ""what are you a fan of"" if anyone else has a similar story."
69,43,"... and if that person were to wear a mask to protect himself, it could have very easily been a retaliation to the very idea of a mask."
81,43,"If you wear a mask in public, you are not going to be sacked and your helmet is not going to change the fact that you are not a lawmaker."

45,43,Vaccination Act is the most important thing of all to be taken into consideration. Does the government even have to care for your safety?
58,43,I hate to be a troll but I like to get out.
62,43,"I had a friend with an HIV infection. He was on a twitchcon, so he was vaccinated. He went on a twitchcon in VT. He told me it wasn't a twitchcon and it was not a twitchcon. And then the friend told him that it was because he had the shit."
69,43,"The video a man posted in the video made it sound like a person could wear a mask to protect himself, especially as they're using it for politics."
81,43,I can't speak for this person - but I'm gonna say something.
89,43,It's one of the dumbest things I've done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask Putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things I've done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask
45,43,Vaccination is the most important thing of all to be taken into consideration. Why the fuck does the government have to take care of your own safety?
58,43,/r/RealityMcConsulting is a good source for a few interesting facts.
62,43,I'm trying to put up with a bit of a debate with people on the internet that we can't get our head around.
69,43,"""Winning a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
81,43,The problem is with what your comment has to do with your comment.
89,43,a guy he is the first person to walk through a restaraunt is one of the dumbest things things i have done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask
45,43,So you wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus?
58,43,I'm sorry I can't do this for you.
62,43,"I'm sorry that I am getting downvoted. The government needs to do something about this, or they won't do it."
69,43,"Well, I know that the CDC is getting a lot of the blame for how it's used. I'm not saying they aren't helping the virus."
81,43,I'm a doctor and I've seen him wear a mask in public several times.
89,43,"I think the point of the movie is that the government doesn't care, as long as it prevents the spread of a virus."
45,43,"I'm not a big fan of the mask, but I do think it has some merit, and it's a pretty good concept. It is just a tad confusing, but it's pretty important."
58,43,"I have never been in a state where the CDC was funded by the NSA. My parents were. I was a medical assistant. I grew up in a country where the CDC could not properly monitor me, I got sick and I was a cdc officer."
62,43,"It's the first thing you do, that I read."
69,43,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
81,43,">I think it's more that there is a way to know for sure if you're on this subreddit, and that people are looking at you and thinking hey, it's a shitshow that makes people cringe at you."
89,43,Is there an ambiguity between a sarcastic joke and a joke about how people wear masks?
45,43,"There's a lot of confusion about how a mask is to prevent a virus, and the whole idea of a mask is about ""people can't really shit when they don't know what it is"" is a joke."
58,43,"In general, I don't see why the NSA would want people to be wearing a mask in the first place. In fact, I think the only thing that can prevent people from getting sick from wearing a mask is a mask."
62,43,"CANNOTANSWER: ""Hey, I think that's a joke. I thought that's a joke. He said ""Hey, I thought that's a joke"". I was thinking that the whole thing was a bad idea and that they're just using the wrong word to explain it."
69,43,"The movie and the article imply that if a person is wearing a mask to protect themselves, they would be using a mask to prevent the spread of the virus, whereas a sex tape is not a threat to the health of the people in those situations."
81,43,"The way you put it. That's a really good, well written, and helpful response."
89,43,This movie made me think it was a joke. I never saw it in school. I only saw it in school. I'm so excited about this movie. I think it's great that you're thinking of a 'dumb joke'. I think a good part of it is that the government has to stop spreading a virus.
45,43,"""Do not wear a mask to protect the body"""
58,43,"This is a really incredibly misleading, and misleading post."
62,43,"CANNOTANSWER: ""I haven't tried to stab someone with a pen? I thought that's a joke. He said ""Hey, I thought that's a joke"". I was thinking that the whole thing was a bad idea and that they're just using the wrong word to explain it. The point of a mask is to prevent people from entering the country, presumably to promote public health. It's about why people don't want to give them something to talk about."
69,43,"I'm not sure if it's related to any of those items, but there are a ton of bogus claims and repercussions for attempting to prevent a situation like that. I also don't know if it's related to the article and the wiki article."
81,43,"""I'm a guy so I can help. And as a man, I wear my mask when I am in public. What I find is that this isn't a real issue. There is an article about ""the NSA."" Rather a video that shows a group of people wearing masks and making the point that they don't have a right to talk about the danger of a virus. The movie has a lot of great jokes about how the government is using it to stop the spread of a virus."
89,43,"You were the one who said ""I don't like the way it's told, because it sounds like a dick joke to me."""
45,43,Vaccination isn't a joke. It's part of a government policy. It's also an attempt at preventing a population from being at a con.
58,43,"I'm a doctor. I'm going to be a doctor, not a medical assistant."
62,43,i'm not going to say anything about whether i wear a mask and what is the point.
69,43,"""The article makes it sound like a person could wear a mask to protect himself, especially as they're using it for politics."""
81,43,"I have to tell you one thing: this is a joke. I am not going to be making a joke about it, I am going to say that I am not comfortable putting on my mask and I am going to be having an argument with my friends about the situation. I don't want to be the one to make that joke, I just want to rehash it and say ""It is not a real issue."""
89,43,People wear masks to stop people from being able to walk like that if it is a joke.
45,43,I was blown away at how bad that movie was. What a good movie. It's a good movie. The story of him not wanting to be in the con scene is pretty well rounded.
58,43,"I'd be more concerned with that... it's a symptom of a lot of issues that I don't understand as a result of the ACA, rather than the fact that it's being passed without the consent of the CDC."
62,43,"I mean, the first thing is going to happen when you get a vaccinated person, and they don't know what the other people are going to do? How can you get a vaccinated person's face stabbed in the face without a mask?"
69,43,So he's using a mask to protect himself? Or something?

89,43,"People wear masks to stop people from being able to walk like that if it is a joke.

45,43,It's a joke. The masks aren't a joke and the people shouldn't wear them.
58,43,"OP, please tell me what your problem is."
62,43,"I'm sorry, i am getting downvoted. The government needs to do something about this, or they won't."
69,43,"This subreddit isn't about the ACA, it's about the threat of the CDC. The CDC and CDC seem to be pushing policies and programs to stop the spread of viral viruses."
81,43,">We wear masks to fight the flu. I don't care who the title is, I think you know the issue."""
89,43,I'd be tempted to make a joke about it if it were a real question.
45,43,So this is a satire of the ad hoc vaccination and not a joke of the ad.
58,43,"You're not a doctor, you're a doctor."
62,43,I'm not a politician. But I do like to do stuff like that.
69,43,"I don't think the ACA is a big deal. It's just not the issue. The ACA is one that people are going to want to take a step back, but it's also the big issue that people seem to be expressing their distaste for."
81,43,What are you going to do if you don't want to be the one to make a joke about it?
89,43,The movie was written by John Lennon and it's one of the dumbest things I've seen in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask.
45,43,"I think it's interesting that his point is so funny, but I still haven't seen it."
58,43,Those numbers suck.
62,43,"Is it true that you are referring to ""The shit is going on. ', ""The shit is going on. ',"" ""I am just reading this so I can understand why you're being a dick. I'm not a politician. But I do like to do stuff like that."
69,43,"It's not going to stop, it's gonna stop. It won't stop."
81,43,I like your use of the word troll.
89,43,"He's also telling you something along the lines of, ""Hey, you don't have to wear your hat. You can't walk ten feet though a restaraunt and then take it off when you get to your table if you don't have a hat. That's not a joke!"""
45,43,"The ""Mask the president to wear a mask"" is a good one and I don't think this is a joke."
58,43,I think the ACA is the best way to stop this. I don't think it's a joke. It's a joke.
62,43,"I think I'm a little overthinking on this. I don't understand how the current twitchcon situation works, which is why the ACA is about protecting people from infection. The point of a mask is to prevent people from entering the country, presumably to promote public health. It's about why people don't want to give them something to talk about."
69,43,"It's not a big deal. It's a big issue. People will want to take a step back, but it's also the big issue that people seem to be expressing their distaste for."
81,43,It is a good question and a good question.
89,43,"No, it's not a dick joke. It's a hat. It's a joke."
45,43,"It's a joke. If you don't like the idea of a ""funny"" joke, then you should definitely be banning AIDS unless your opponent is a fan."
58,43,I think this is a good way to tell you that the ACA is actually being a joke.
62,43,>You're saying the ACA isn't good for people.
69,43,"I'm going to go get a mask to protect myself, but I don't think I could wear it myself. It's a mask for my own protection. It's not a mask for protection against the spread of virus or the spread of disease. But it does help the fight against HIV. Is there anything that is wrong with it?"
81,43,This subreddit has an excellent amount of information on all these issues and I'm assuming it's not entirely based off a general generalization.
89,43,That makes sense. It's just a very good way to deal with a real problem. It's probably going to be funny. It will be funny if it is just some sort of novelty treat.
45,43,"I don't think it's a joke. I think a joke about that was probably a way to evoke a reaction. If the joke is a joke, then you're probably not a very serious fan of a joke."
58,43,It is one of the reasons why people wear masks.
62,43,>I'm not sure if anyone here is aware of this. I'm sorry but I am a dick. I think he should be in a better place and this situation is going to be a dick story.
69,43,The President of the United States is wearing a mask for protection against the spread of HIV
81,43,"You need to understand that ""Meats are part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."" i.e., the hat is an important part of our system. There is no need to do anything about it."
89,43,"I think the one you're going to say is a joke about wearing a mask. You don't have to do it, you don't have to wear a hat. You don't have to wear a hat because you can't walk. The hat is a joke about how people wear masks, but a lot of people think it's a joke about how people can walk because of their hair."
45,43,The movie is a satire and it's actually a comedy. I think it's hilarious that people haven't seen it.
58,43,"That's some really awful, silly, deceptive stuff."
62,43,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. I have heard of this, I think it's pretty good advice. I feel like you've gone on too long to really get to the point where you're just going to go with the dick story.

69,43,"If I had to pick which of these I would be the CDC President, or the CDC General Manager. I would use a mask to prevent the spread of the virus."
81,43,Nope. Just nope.
89,43,"If you like the humor, I'd recommend getting a book about it. It is a lot like 'Fucking the Restaraunt' but the story is more about a mask than a mask. 'Fucking the Restaraunt' is a joke if you don't like it.'"
45,43,It's a joke. And it's not a joke.
58,43,i think the ACA is the best way to stop this. I think it's a joke.
62,43,A few months ago I read that 'Refusing to wear a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

81,43,"No, this isn't a real issue."
89,43,"Yes, I did. My parents gave me a great book called ""Jokes"" for that movie and I grew up with it. Then they told me that they were going to use them on a lot of people. Then they read the book, and I'm pretty sure that there was an entire episode of the movie."
45,43,Vaccination is an important part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
58,43,"I'm a doctor who has a mask on, as long as you don't get a sick fecal."

58,43,"I grew up in a country where the CDC could not properly monitor me, I got sick and I was a medical assistant."

45,43,My first reaction to your post was I'm going to have to take your wit to heart. You seem to be a fucking dick.
58,43,"No. It's a joke. It's a joke, because you can't even tell whether or not you want to see this shit. The ACA is a prank. The CDC is a joke."
62,43,"The point of the ACA is to allow people to become active citizens without fear of being sued, and they are wasting their time. The ACA protects the people of Vermont from infection."
69,43,"The article he's talking about the ACA is a pretty interesting read, largely in line with the general theme."

89,43,">It seems the people in the movie are putting on a mask, so it's not that that's a prank."
45,43,What do you think the CDC does to prevent AIDS? The fact that they do this to prevent it is enough to convince people they need a mask.
