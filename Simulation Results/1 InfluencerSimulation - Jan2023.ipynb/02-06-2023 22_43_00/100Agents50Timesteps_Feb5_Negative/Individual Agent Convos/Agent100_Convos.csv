100,38,You are a genius. I can't get past this.

100,15,Oh no. You do not like wearing a mask because you have a hard time breathing and you want to talk about the same thing.
100,28,This is the most stupid and cruel sentence in this thread
100,38,"That's not true. You need to wear a mask, but don't forget that this program will be aimed at reducing the risk of a serious infection in the world's poorest population."
100,39,"So that's what is in your mask. What you're saying is that you're the one who has the problem, and is not going to help you. You're gonna tell me you can't get past this. It's not really a science lesson, ya know?"
100,62,I've actually been told by my friends that wearing a mask is a really great idea to prevent people from having to breathe in a virus. They are so busy that it's hard to see a doctor for a bacterial infection. They just want someone else to know that they can't just go into a shit room and take a mask.
100,65,oh hey maroon i am sorry to tell you that You guys are too young to tell me this. You should wear a mask.

100,67,"I really don't like wearing a mask, but I like it as a little bit of a reminder to put my back together and wear it a bit when I'm feeling bad."
100,69,"I have no idea how to do that but I want to give you an answer :). It's not that he doesn't like wearing a mask because his friend has a hard time breathing. I don't know how to tell you, but you could always just go to your friends and tell them you're in a similar situation if you don't like wearing a mask, they are just as stupid as they are."
100,70,He can eat anything but the stuff he wants and it doesn't mean he has to wear it and he cannot change his mask.
100,78,[NAME] is a guy who wears a mask on all the time to fight cancer and his family. The only people that don't like wearing a mask are people who don't like it.
100,81,"I have a feeling I'm doing something wrong, like if you do a fucking miracle to my breathing, I'm going to die. I don't know why you can't, but you're just like me..."
100,84,"That is a good one, but i can't seem to find a good one."
100,98,"I'm not really sure what kind of mask this guy is wearing, but I have seen it many times."
100,2,"This is a great thread for you. If you are not a good person, then this is not the right place to start. I am sorry that you have to go through this."
100,4,My friend wears a mask on every night and she's had the same symptoms for a year and a half now. She can eat whatever he wants but she has a hard time breathing and she can't get out of it. It is a very difficult thing to do to me and I'm going through the process of just going from wearing a mask to having a hard time breathing.
100,14,That sounds pretty awesome to me!
100,15,It sounds like people are trying to help their sick friends and they are attempting to give them something to talk about. It's just this is how people react to these people in situations that are naive and pathetic. They feel like they're a bad person for not knowing what's going on. They want to be more able to talk to others.
100,28,"That's the point. He's talking about wearing a mask and his health, he's being a jerk to his friends. That was the point."
100,38,You're being a dick. You aren't right. Having a mask doesn't mean it's actually working. You're wrong.
100,39,There is a new virus in the lungs that causes you to eat the food you eat?

100,62,I'm sorry to tell you that.
100,65,I'm a man who wears a mask all the time to fight cancer and his family.
100,67,"My friends and I had a hard time breathing. And if a guy could only take a breath without their own mask, they'd have to go through some really long hospital stays. So, I wear my mask and I don't even have to know what it is or how long. "
100,69,"[He wears a mask for the pain of the symptoms, it helps him breathe better.](https://www.rps.nc.gov/resources/Pages/advice/videos/advice/advice-and-infections-a-body-smears/comments/diagnosis-difficult-smear-and-infectio-paint)"
100,70,"OP is not an expert in HIV/AIDS, and it is possible that people who don't like wearing a mask can't breathe."
100,78,"I don't like wearing a mask, but I do wear a mask when I'm feeling bad. If I'm really bad I wear a mask, like, 1 4 of the time."
100,81,"I'm not really sure what kind of mask the guy is wearing, but i have seen it many times."
100,84,"He says he wears a mask to fight cancer, but he isn't wearing it to fight bacterial infections. He's saying the same thing to his friends and it is a terrible statement, which is absurd. He is wearing a mask to keep people from getting sick and breathing."
100,98,I really don't like wearing a mask.
100,2,It's not about how a mask works. It's about why people think it's a bad thing.
100,4,"I'm in the UK. I don't have a mask because I get cancer, but my allergies are awfully bad and it causes me to breathe. I know it does nothing to keep people alive. It's pretty much my life."
100,14,I don't like wearing a mask. I just don't think it works for me.
100,15,"OP: ""What did you do to help yourself?"""
100,28,"I don't know what the fuck is going on. Is it just me, or does the virus actually exist?"
100,38,"He said his genitals aren't well. He told his friends he wasn't doing enough, but that his doctors didn't tell him."
100,39,"I have a friend who does it and he has a hard time breathing. I'm a big fan of all of those things because I'm so used to it and I love it and I like to wear it whenever I go to see his friends and he's just the type of person to talk to. So he's kind of a dick. You have a weird way of talking about the problem, and they're the type to be kind of friendly to me, and I don't think he can get anything out of it. I can't"
100,62,He wore a mask on for all this time.
100,65,"Having a mask to combat a disease is not the same as being a dick. It is the same way you say ""I don't know what it is I'm just like you. I don't know what it is but I don't know what it is but I don't know how to eat it so that I'm not feeling bad"". I've been told it works. It is a good thing I am not a dick. Having a mask is like being a joke."
100,67,"This is one of the most egregious things I've ever heard. There's a logical way to tell that the only people with AIDS who wear a mask are the ones with no symptoms, and don't know what their symptoms are. The problem is that they're not allowed to tell their friends."
100,69,>It's not that I think maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that].
100,70,It sounds like they're trying to naive and pathetic. They want to give them something to talk about. It's just this is how people react to these people in situations that are naive and pathetic. They feel like they're being a dick. You're being a dick. I am sorry to tell you that.
100,78,"This is the biggest problem with people. The more you think about it, the more you think it will actually work."
100,81,"What I find disturbing is the way OP's post is interpreted. He's wearing a mask for the pain of the symptoms, and it helps him breathe better. And it's the way he is telling his friends what it means to have a hard time breathing. And he's lying and telling their friends he doesn't like it, and he's just not listening to them."
100,84,"So if the ""you're being a dick"" is something I can understand and you don't like, it's time to get the people who don't want to be there to see what's going on. What is going on is the fucking government trying to help people."
100,98,The first thing to call the cops is to show up at the hospital and have a sex tape to check for the infection.
100,2,"This is an interesting and common thread, and it sounds like the most egregious thing you've ever heard."
100,4,Is there a way to get your health checks and test results to determine if you have HIV?
100,14,"Well, I'd like to thank you for explaining how a mask is not good for you because it can't help you if you're allergic."
100,15,"I'm just reading this so I can understand why you're being a dick. What I'm thinking is that when you get sick your brain will respond to the diagnosis. It's not like your body can't heal itself, it's a virus. There's no way to tell that. You're just telling your brain that you don't care and you're trying to talk to someone who isn't sure how to behave and how to live their lives. You're simply telling them that this doesn't work. That's how people react to"
100,28,So what is the main issue with people with AIDS?
100,38,The fuck is going on.
100,39,"That's a good point about a mask, but I don't think you can make that argument."
100,62,So you don't wear a mask? It's not about how a mask works. It's about why people don't want to give them something to talk about.
100,65,"The question is: ""What was I doing to help myself?"""
100,67,"I'm a little ashamed to say this, but I've heard about this on a couple of occasions, I'm not sure whether it's a good idea or not. Then again, I've read that the government tries to discourage people from wearing a mask, because it's a great way to help people, which is so hard to ignore."
100,69,"The AIDS research group. Is he being a dick? He has a history of a fever, but he doesn't have a chronic illness, he has some form of HIV infection."
100,70,"I had to walk out of the house to go to the ER for the first day because I didn't like it. And after a week, I was feeling very sick and vomiting."
100,78,It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
100,81,This is a really unhelpful misunderstanding of the problem and the way it is being treated.
100,84,It sounds like they're trying to naive and pathetic. They want to give them something to talk about.
100,98,"It's all about the mask. It's for a specific area, like the neck. The neck area has the same size and shape as the neck area, so it's easier to look in your own chest. The chest is also a place to keep a clot. The chest is in a different shape. So even though I wear a mask when I'm bad I wear a mask when I'm bad. It's because I don't have a clot and it's too painful to breathe."
100,2,">This is an interesting and common thread, and it sounds like the most egregious thing you've ever heard."
100,4,People with HIV are very often the ones who die on the basis of a mask. It's often a sign of insecurity.
100,14,>I'm just reading this so I can understand why you're being a dick.
100,15,I'm going to go with this.
100,28,"It's kinda funny you describe the thing when you mention he is having a hard time breathing. You see, you get a bad clot from the neck, or from the inside. You look at a bad clot from the outside. You don't see a clot from the inside. It's very painful."
100,38,"The problem is that there's a stigma attached to it. I'm sure it's not all about being a dick and I think it's a good idea to show it off. And if I were you I would get an ER check, I wouldn't wear one because the stigma doesn't get the message across."
100,39,I don't care if you're trying to fuck this OP.
100,62,"I was going to say I was just trying to explain it to you. The problem is, if you don't know who it is, your friends are naive. I think you should be able to find someone that doesn't know you."
100,65,"A mask is not a dick when someone is harmed by HIV. There's a reason it is not a mask, and that's only because someone can be infected. It's a mask that's made to be worn by people who don't care about their health. It's a mask. It's for the specific area of your body, like your neck and a certain amount of skin lining."
100,67,"OP's post is interpreted. He's wearing a mask for the pain of the symptoms, and it helps him breathe better. And it's the way he is telling his friends what it means to have a hard time breathing. And he's lying and telling their friends he doesn't like it, and he's just not listening to them."
100,69,"I have a doctor that did a sex tape on me. The doctor told me it helps the sexy clots. She was in the hospital. She lied and told her a lot about the sex tape. The doctor said that the sex tape helps him breathe and was supposedly used by him. The doctor told her to not to wear a mask because of the sex tape, she did not see any other signs. I'm not sure what the doctors would tell you."
100,70,"This is a ridiculous response. What would it matter if you said, ""But if you wear a mask, how can I breathe without it?"""
100,78,"I'm glad I could get through this. I do not think he should wear a mask, it's just that he's wearing a mask, because he feels like he's 'behaving badly' he shouldn't be able to see his breathing better. I think it's more of a reaction to the fact that he's telling his friends, ""I do like wearing a mask, but I do wear a mask when I'm feeling really bad."""
100,81,"I don't get why they think it helps them or not. They think the mask helps them. I get how the government is trying to stop people from trying to find someone to be friendly, but that doesn't mean that the government is going to make them go around trying to help people."
100,84,"I'm very sorry to tell you this. It's hard to explain why this isn't the main issue with people with AIDS. It's an interesting and common thread, and it sounds like an interesting and pathetic thing to say."
100,98,"That is why I don't wear a mask at all. But that's it. I don't like it, I don't like it. Is he still doing that? Does he really want to be that guy? Does he really want to be a part of this whole conversation?"
100,2,"He said, ""There is a stigma attached to it."""
100,4,This is a really unhelpful misunderstanding of the problem and the way it is being treated.
100,14,What's the point of wearing a mask?
100,15,It seems that the guy is trying to be a good friend by referring to him as a sex addict. I think it's time to start thinking more critically.
100,28,"I don't know about people with AIDS, but I believe he may have a clot and doesn't have a mask for a long time. That would be a sign of insecurity. I don't know what you're asking, but I think the problem isn't just him, and he might be trying to get them to wear it for the sake of a mask."
100,38,The biggest thing is the stigma - he can't stop wearing it. I would be concerned if he just wore it because he knew he wasn't doing enough to not get the message across.
100,39,I want you to understand that this is one of the most common things [[NAME]'s post is interpreted as. You are using a metaphorical or a metaphorical form of a post to illustrate a misunderstanding.
100,62,">I am just reading this so I can understand why you're being a dick. I'm going to go with this. I do not think he should wear a mask, it's just that he's wearing a mask, because he feels like he's 'behaving badly' he shouldn't be able to see his breathing better."
100,65,Yes it's a mask. A mask is a mask for a specific area of your body.

100,78,"This guy is just trying to get his friends to not wear masks, because it doesn't work. He's trying to show off that he's not willing to put up with this kind of stigma."
100,81,"I have never seen anyone with AIDS who is a dick, but to me it makes me feel like an idiot."

100,98,"In a nutshell, I do not know what I'm talking about. What's it like having a sex tape and not knowing what to wear to help you breathing, or how to take care of yourself, but to not be able to talk about it with anyone else?"
100,2,">'The biggest thing is the stigma - he can't stop wearing it.

100,4,"What do you mean by ""I am just trying to understand why this isn't the main issue with people with AIDS""?"
100,14,Well you're saying you do not like wearing a mask because it's uncomfortable and you don't think that's a sign of insecurity?
100,15,"The problem is not just him, but a lot of people with AIDS."
100,28,It sounds like the whole story was about a guy he told his friends to not wear a mask because he felt like a dick.
100,38,"It's not about being a dick, it's about making the guy feel bad. He's trying to prove that being a dick isn't good for someone who has to deal with an infection."
100,39,>I am just reading this so I can understand why you're being a dick. I think it's time to start thinking more critically.
100,62,"I believe you are getting the wrong idea. I don't want to be able to wear a mask to prevent my friends from breathing if they aren't comfortable. I don't like wearing it because I'm feeling terrible and I can't imagine doing it while sick or with a serious illness. Definitely don't wear it if you can't. If I were you, he would probably have a mask on for an extended period of time."
100,65,IANAL - I've been a doctor for five years and my friend's wife is a doctor. She was diagnosed with HIV/Aids and told me that she wore a mask all the time to help her health.
100,67,"It's not a healthy way to help you, it's a healthy way to tell people that you have a hard time breathing. That's a different story. That doesn't mean you should do it."
100,69,There's a stigma attached to AIDS and a lot of misunderstandings. What are your thoughts on a doctor who knows how to do it?
100,70,"Yes, but it is hard to tell if he wants to put his mask on."
100,78,So his friend wears a mask to fight cancer and his family?
100,81,You are talking about AIDS. The stigma. It's not just someone who's not using it. It's just someone who's sexist.
100,84,"People with AIDS who wear a mask to be on their own or in groups are more likely to have this illness, but can't necessarily be cured."
100,98,I feel like this guy sounds very out of place. You guys seem to have had the best relationship in years.
100,2,"I would go up on his hair and say: ""It sounds like they're trying to naive and pathetic. They want to give them something to talk about. It's all about the mask. It's for a specific area, like the neck."
100,4,"People with AIDS can't be cured if they're wearing a mask, so there is no way to really get help with it. It's been 5 years now and a lot of people are wearing masks, so its very important to understand. The most important thing to remember is to have the ability to recognize that some people are not immune."
100,14,>I am just reading this so I can understand why you're being a dick. I think it's time to start thinking more critically.
100,15,"AIDS sufferers are not being able to talk to anyone and anyone with it. That is a dangerous and extremely dangerous disease, not one that needs to be treated, nor cured, by anyone. In many cases, people who are not able to tell the difference between being able to talk and being able to talk aren't able to talk to them."
100,28,"He's trying to get people to wear masks to fight a disease that's not healthy. He's expressing his feelings by saying he'd like people to wear masks, and he's trying to show that the stigma isn't a bad thing to prevent. It's not a good idea to make people feel bad and it's not right for everyone, and he's trying to make his friends feel worse because he's trying to get people to take care of himself and to wear a mask because they are not comfortable and he'"
100,38,I'm going to go read some of his posts.
100,39,This guy sounds very out of place.
100,62,Is he wearing a mask because he feels like a dick or because he doesn't know what a mask is or isn't comfortable? Because that's a really good idea and he is probably going to feel the same.
100,65,A doctor does not wear a mask to prevent others from breathing. It is a mask for the specific areas of your body.
100,67,"Wearing a mask for the pain of the symptoms, and it helps him breathe better. And it's the way he is telling his friends what it means to have a hard time breathing. That's a different story. That doesn't mean you should do it."
100,69,What's the best way to end a relationship with him? How long has he been with you?

100,81,I think it's a big deal.
100,84,So what do you think about this guy?
100,98,I'm not the kind of person that would think that that would be worth a lot.
100,2,"""I'm not the person who wants to be with this guy."
100,4,"I'm trying to help, but this guy isn't doing anything to improve his life. This is not a good thing for him, he's a jerk, he's being disrespectful, and this is not fair. And what he does is wrong. He should have been treated in a more positive light because it's a very important thing."
100,14,""" I really do think he should wear a mask because he feels like a dick, that's a sign of insecurity. He's trying to help others, but he's not."""
100,15,">I think it's time to start thinking more critically."", ""What did you do to help yourself?"", ""I really do think he should wear one because he feels like a dick, that's a sign of insecurity."
100,28,"I just wanted to point out that this guy, like many others, is actually a pretty stupid asshole who tries to make others feel better about themselves, and then he actually tries to make people feel better. It's a big, scary question, and I've been there."
100,38,I'm not trying to hurt you. You are not insulting me. I'm just saying that I can't be happy wearing a mask without my health insurance cover.
100,39,This is one of the most common mental illness problems. He needs to change his mind.
100,62,"Why should he have a mask on for that long? I feel like you're getting a lot of criticism for this, but I do know that I want to continue to juggle all these topics because I think we're both having a difficult time getting past this situation."
100,65,I think the way he's responding is that it sounds like a very unintentional lie and that he's making it a big deal.
100,67,"""If you want to fight a disease in the long run, wear a mask and get a new one. It's not a healthy way to help you, it's a healthy way to tell people that you have a hard time breathing."","
100,69,"I've been in many relationships where the one with the AIDS guy is a ""fucking asshole"" that's the reason I don't want to be with him. But now I think there's another big deal. And that's a problem with a mental illness. A person with an AIDS diagnosis isn't a dick."
100,70,"This post gets you going all the way to the comments about AIDS. AIDS is a huge problem in the US, and most of the stigma is based on that."
100,78,'It's a big deal'. That's why you can't blame him for his behavior.
100,81,You’re being a dick. It’s a big deal. What do you think about this guy?
100,84,...I think he's too late.
100,98,"""He said that his doctors didn't tell him. The question is whether you are a very serious person with a medical condition and a very difficult one to diagnose? I have a condition and I don't think it's a very common mental health issue."
100,2,"""It's a big deal. It's a big deal. a big deal."
100,4,"CANNOTANSWER: ""I've never seen anyone in my life who has had a hard time breathing for a couple of years. I know it does nothing to keep people alive. It's pretty much my life."""
100,14,What are you going to say to OP?
100,15,I'm not surprised. This isn't what you're thinking. There's nothing to be scared of with this situation.
100,28,You've been in relationships where the guy isn't getting anything.
100,38,"You have already done that. Get a mask, but don't wear it."
100,39,He sounds like a dick. Why would anyone wear a mask on someone with AIDS? Unless that's the guy with the AIDS?
100,62,I have a mental illness.
100,65,You're being sarcastic.
100,67,I don't know about this one. This guy is talking to a man in public and he has not told anyone about his illness.
100,69,"""He's wearing a mask because he feels like a dick...I'm not sure if you're trying to make a defensive point or just an erudite one, but I feel like I am a dick."""
100,70,I think the first part is about him not having an understanding of AIDS.
100,78,"I am in love with someone who wears a mask all the time to fight cancer. He doesn't want to be associated with the person wearing a mask, so he wears a mask and is trying to help others."
100,81,"My mother had a friend who was ill with HIV, who would get it for free after a few years. They got the idea he was a dick. He got the idea he could not be treated like that without being cured."
100,84,>I'm not the kind of person that would think that would be worth a lot.
100,98,Why is the man going to wear a mask if the world wants to see what it is?
100,2,"OP isn't saying that it's a big deal, he's saying it's something to be ashamed of. If the problem hasn't been dealt with, why would it be a big deal to him to wear a mask when he doesn't know that it's the real deal?"
100,4,"I don't think that's the way to get a diagnosis. People who have HIV have a different disease that they have more often, and the stigma associated with it has increased over the past decade."
100,14,"The guy's insecure and needs to have some counseling, and the doctor hasn't told him how."
100,15,I've read a few times:
100,28,"I'd suggest you look into it - AIDS's a pretty complex virus, and has a good stigma associated with it. You can't just wear a mask and not snoop into his room to help."
100,38,You can't use your mask to make him feel better. It's not to make him feel better.
100,39,"if the problem is the mask, it's time to start thinking more critically. I don't think this is the case, but it is a big deal."
100,62,I think your bluff is pretty good.
100,65,"There is nothing he can do to stop the spread of HIV or prevent it. HIV is a deadly disease. HIV is not a deadly disease and is a serious issue. There is no good reason to put a mask on someone who has AIDS. If you have HIV, it doesn't make you a bad person. It's a big deal."
100,67,"People are suffering from HIV (infectious disease, not illness)."
100,69,"You're saying ""he's wearing a mask because he feels like a dick... I'm not sure if you're trying to make a defensive point or just an erudite one, but I feel like I am a dick."""
100,70,"The reason that he wears it is because it isn't easy to find someone who can't get it is because they are wearing a mask to save them from getting it. It's actually kind of hard to imagine that his mother would give him it if he was in a position to see if she had AIDS. It's not like he had a AIDS diagnosis and she didn't know if the doctors were the ones to diagnose it. The doctors only told him because of his condition and there's nothing to blame, but you can't know"
100,78,>Why is the man going to wear a mask if the world wants to see what it is?
100,81,OP's post is overtly interpreted by people. This doesn't sound like a troll.
100,84,Why are you not the kind of person that would think that would be worth a lot. Why is the man going to wear a mask if the world wants to see what it is?
100,98,"""The problem is not just the stigma, but the stigma attached to it."
100,2,"It's not ""a big deal"" or ""A big deal."" That's the way it was written. It's not a bad thing."
100,4,IANAL. I have been diagnosed with AIDS at 16 and I can't help you with anything else.
100,14,"AIDS is a serious illness and it is very very prevalent. It is very difficult to get a diagnosis and you want to be able to prevent it. You are not a deceiver. He needs to be told how, and that is what he needs."
100,15,if you aren't able to tell if someone is getting it you are still sick. You aren't going to know what he is suffering from.
100,28,I don't think you're right. He sounds like a troll.
100,38,> he's wearing a mask because he feels like a dick
100,39,">The guy's in love with someone who wears a mask all the time to fight cancer. He doesn't want to be associated with the person wearing a mask, so he wears a mask and is trying to help others."
100,62,>He doesn't want to be associated with the person wearing a mask
100,65,"[This is a good article about how the government is trying to keep people from wearing the mask in order to prevent AIDS."""
100,67,I'm talking about the people who had HIV in the early 20th century.
100,69,This is not a troll post. Why are you trying to make a defensive point?
100,70,"There is no way to know if someone has AIDS but the stigma associated with it, or if people who do have HIV are just like him."
100,78,It sounds like the hive mind is going to get too used to the idea of having someone else to talk to about it - and that's one of the reasons the stigma exists. Getting a better doctor - is more akin to having a doctor who can't give you a better diagnosis.
100,81,"If a guy had this and was ill with AIDS, would he fuck that up? It's not about him, but it's about being the person who has AIDS and wants it."
100,84,"He has a doctor that he uses to deal with some of the problems he has. It is a complex disease, it is not just a disease, it is a serious health issue. There is nothing we can do to fix it, but we can do things for others."
100,98,"""This is a big deal. People are suffering from AIDS."
100,2,"It's no big deal if he's actually wearing it to help people who have AIDS. His friends, family, anyone who wears it, haven't done much of anything to stop the virus from spreading. It's not just a scar, it's a scar."
100,4,>Why is the man going to wear a mask if the world wants to see what it is?
100,14,"It is a serious illness, which is very difficult to get a diagnosis and prevent, and has the stigma attached to it. You are not a deceiver. He needs to be told how, and that is what he needs."
100,15,The shit post from the same subreddit is a troll. It's not because the post is interpreted poorly or misunderstood. It's that this man is trying to help people and is a troll.
100,28,"I'm just going to get straight on this, but you have a whole lot to say about this. What do you mean, that the problem isn't just him. But he's trying to get people to wear a mask, and to help."
100,38,>He is wearing a mask because he feels like a dick.
100,39,"RIP The Man with the AIDS, and the mask for the people who are trying to fuck this guy."
100,62,"AIDS has a lot of social stigma, not just the stigma associated with it."
100,65,"I've been with a doctor for 5 years, and we're both a very lucky bunch of kids. The problem is the stigma attached to it. The mask is not good for sex and doesn't really address the problem."
100,67,They're wearing a mask to make sure they don't get AIDS. It's a health issue that affects people and is not even a health issue in itself.
100,69,>I think the best way to end a relationship with him is to get a doctor to tell him that he needs a mask.
100,70,"Is it because he wears a mask and wants to save people from AIDS? Because there's a huge stigma attached to that and is it not about him? Because if he doesn't have it, he's sick. If not, it's because the mask has gotten uncomfortable and uncomfortable."
100,78,It's not a troll post. Why are you trying to make a defensive point? There is no way to know if someone has AIDS but the stigma attached to it.
100,81,>I don't get why they think it helps them or not. They think the mask helps them.
100,84,[Did I mention to OP that I don't like wearing a mask at all](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbyrno)?
100,98,I can not be sure what other reasons people use to get their shit together.
100,2,"This whole post is kind of like a troll. The guy said he wants a shambles. I can't imagine what the ""shame"" in this post means."
100,4,"I've been diagnosed with AIDS at 16, and it is so debilitating, it's kind of hard to even realize that he's suffering from it in some way. What's your point? The stigma attached to it isn't that it's a disease, its that people are uncomfortable and afraid of being sanitized or treated in a way that doesn't make him a jerk or someone else, it's because there's no way to get a diagnosis and isn't much more difficult to get a diagnosis."
100,14,So this is why I am a girl. It's not a bad idea to make a remark.
100,15,"People with AIDS are not allowed to wear a mask, because it is a symptom of mental illness."
100,28,[NAME][/NAME] (r/AIDS) was a friend and friend of the one who was diagnosed with AIDS. They both said they were ill and have HIV.
100,38,It sounds like the shit post from the same subreddit is a troll. I'm just going to get straight on this. What do you mean?
100,39,... but he needs to go out and sleep with his friends if possible.
100,62,"He's wearing a mask to help people with AIDS. If he is going to wear a mask and have AIDS, the best thing to do would be to go to the doctor."
100,65,''Having a mask is a good thing I am not a dick.
100,67,"The government seems to do the best they can to stop the spread of HIV. I mean, there are a few things that should not be part of your life..."
100,69,>A person with an AIDS diagnosis isn't a dick.
100,70,">I don't like wearing a mask because I don't have the IQ to do it. If not, it's because the mask has gotten uncomfortable and uncomfortable. It's not a defensive point."
100,78,It's not a good sign that someone is wearing a mask.
100,81,"I feel like OP is trying to be a dick. I'm trying to make a defensive point, but I am just a dick. I don't really understand what you're trying to say here."
100,84,"-""I'm not a deceiver. They want to give them something to talk about. It's all about the mask. It's for a specific area, like the neck."""
100,98,It's a really big deal that people like him are gonna wear it all the time. But he really needs to start telling his doctor that.
100,2,"I think you are being a bit extreme. It's not a huge deal, it's just a bit ridiculous. But I'd suggest to him to read the book, or maybe to the guy who drew the line. It isn't the same as any of those books that aren't published. It's a book that focuses on AIDS. You can also read books like [The Secret History of HIV](https://www.reddit.com/r/AIDS/wiki/Dad_The Secret_Remembering"
100,4,"The fact that a mask would only help with some of the symptoms doesn't change the fact that the CDC has a ""cease and desist approach"" to the treatment of AIDS."
100,14,"I'd get an ER check, I wouldn't wear one because the stigma doesn't get the message across. I just think that in order to combat this, a mask is going to help. I am sure he's trying to help others, but he's not."
100,15,It sounds like the man is trying to be a good friend by referring to him as a sex addict. I think it's time to start thinking more critically. It seems that the guy is trying to help his friends with AIDS. It sounds like people are trying to help their sick friends and they are attempting to give them something to talk about. It's just this is how people react to these people in situations that are naive and pathetic. They feel like they're a bad person for not knowing what's going on.
100,28,The fact that people wear masks is an indicator of what the person is experiencing. AIDS does not come from a mental illness. The stigma associated with it is an indicator of mental illness.
100,38,I don't really like the stigma attached to AIDS.
100,39,It is a big deal that people like him are gonna wear it all the time. If he wants to go out and sleep with his friends if possible.
100,62,"He's talking about AIDS, and if he's not wearing a mask he probably is not wearing a mask."
100,65,"People with HIV have HIV and I am sorry to say that if you don't have a mask, you are a dick. The question is ""What was I doing to help myself?"""
100,67,This isn't a healthy way to tell people about AIDS. The problem is that it's not healthy.
100,69,Why doesn't he wear a mask to prevent the spread of the virus?
100,70,CANNOTANSWER: [POST]. The mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.It's not a troll post. Why are you trying to make a defensive point? There is no way to know if someone has AIDS but the stigma attached to it. There is no way to know if someone has AIDS but the stigma attached to it.

100,81,I'm sorry but I don't understand what you're trying to say.
100,84,I'm just being ridiculous.
100,98,"This troll, you say. I'm not saying he needs to wear a mask because he has a lot of reasons, but I do think it's a big deal."
100,2,"In this case, it's because his friend has been living without AIDS for 5 years. Having a mask in the hospital during that time is not a deal breaker. He's in the middle of his disease and it seems like he is still dealing with it."
100,4,"AIDS is one of the most difficult health conditions. It is considered an infection and in an epidemic. The stigma of AIDS is much more prevalent in those people who are infected, especially in those who are infected with it."
100,14,It sounds like the guy is trying to be a good friend by referring to him as a sex addict. I think it's time to start thinking more critically.
100,15,"CANNOTANSWER: ""I think it's time to start thinking more critically."""
100,28,"Yes, this is not a serious problem."
100,38,The CDC has the same idea. They don't want to stop spreading the disease.
100,39,He's saying he should wear a mask and he’s having a hard time breathing because he can’t eat and sleep and that’s probably an important part of his problem. I wouldn’t wear a mask. I would say it’s an important part of his health and it’s essential that he has a mask so that he’s doing something to stop him from having a hard time breathing. But he needs to talk to his doctor and he’s being a dick. I’m just a dick.
100,62,He's trying to get a better job and is taking the risk that he won't get a better job.
100,65,I think the point is that you are being sarcastic and trying to be a dick.
100,67,"The people who have AIDS still wear masks, and the ones that do not wear them, can't find a better way to treat them and they will probably be more reluctant to get it, and they are more likely to have a hard time managing their symptoms themselves (I'm sorry)"
100,69,He doesn't want to wear a mask because he's an asshole.
100,70,"A guy with AIDS (I can see it happening. I've been wearing a mask my entire life, and I've done a lot of things to help and be safe) is in the CDC's ""cease and desist approach"" to the treatment of AIDS. It's the only thing that I know about him is that I'm sure he has some mental illness and is trying to convince people of something."
100,78,I think that's what people are saying because the stigma doesn't necessarily stop people from wearing a mask.
100,81,"I think that's a misunderstanding, not a mental illness. I think the guy's talking about a 'defensive' point, but his explanation doesn't sound good."

100,98,"You have read my previous comments and I'm sorry but I'm not going to go with the dick story. I'm sorry but I don't think it's right that he is not wearing a mask, and he's not actually wearing a mask. He says the mask is too blatantly offensive, and he tries to convince you that the only thing that makes you think he should wear it is because of the stigma attached to it. It's like saying ""Why are you gonna be a part of this conversation?"""
100,2,A man with AIDS and AIDS can't stand a real life if he is not wearing a mask. His attitude is too blatantly offensive and offensive. It's also the way that people react to things that aren't his fault and aren't he a bad guy.
100,4,"I am trying to be the best friend in the world by telling this guy to just wear his mask. I think the best way to end the relationship is to get a diagnosis, or at least to make him more comfortable, than any of the other person."

100,69,"He is a doctor, not a doctor, because he needs a mask, not to be a dick, not to be a dick, but to be a dick."

100,78,"I don't understand what you're trying to say here. I'm just saying I don't think it's a deal breaker. I just think it's a misunderstanding, not a mental illness."
100,81,"A mental illness is a mental illness. There are many ways that people can live with AIDS, the CDC is one of them. It is something that can cause a lot of problems for both individuals and individuals. It is a mental illness. There are other factors that affect you as well - your own mental health, your own psyche, your emotions, your own body, etc."
100,84,"It sounds like the government is trying to help people with AIDS. They are trying to protect them, and are trying to make this more of an issue."
100,98,"The problem is not just the stigma, but the stigma attached to it. This is the reason why a woman with AIDS has an issue with the CDC, and to blame it on this guy. This is something that should be addressed if he becomes ill, and is trying to convince him to get a better job. If he starts using it as a mask and he does not want to change his ways to help, and that's because he wants to help, he should do it and that's a huge deal in terms of mental illness."
100,2,This is my first sentence of the book.
100,4,"""I think you need to be honest with him."
100,14,"This guy needs to go to the ER, if he's not there, he needs to go to the ER. He's not a guy and he isn't just getting a diagnosis and he's putting a lot of thought into how he is putting it on but he's not being a dick."
100,15,Why does he have to wear a mask? It's not in the text itself - it's in the video for someone that isn't familiar with HIV and is also not able to talk about it.

So it's no big deal to say this but it's a bad idea to suggest it to people who have it. It's just not fair for the patient to assume he doesn't have HIV but his doctor has made the same mistake and lied to him that it helps him breathe better.

100,84,I don't like them trying to help people with AIDS.
100,98,I want to say that I’m not really sure what the difference is between a mask and a sex tape. Having an AIDS virus is not something to go in with a sex tape. It’s more of a mask to be worn when you’re not well.
100,2,"They are talking about a very serious and complex disease, the AIDS, and the mental issues with a mask. The problem is that he has a mental disorder. He needs a mask to see people. He needs a sex tape. He needs to get better."

100,39,"If you have a diagnosis of AIDS and don't have a mask, I would have nothing to worry about."
100,62,"I'm going to read this and read that the problem isn't just his skin, but his mask. I don't think you're getting the wrong idea. I think that the problem is that he doesn't know what a mask is, but that is a very serious illness that's been a serious issue for quite some time now. That is, he isn't wearing a mask for his health. I think he is wearing a mask for the sake of helping other people who have a mental illness."
100,65,"The article also explains how a ""defensive"" diagnosis doesn't have to mean a medical issue."
100,67,"The article says it's more about how the stigma he has is that they are telling his friends to get them to wear their own mask, but he doesn't really understand that. So it makes sense to me."
100,69,What are your thoughts on a doctor who knows how to do it?
100,70,This guy is being an asshole.
100,78,"In our society, we do all kinds of things to avoid stigma, but I don't want to be the one in the picture to be seen as such. It's not like he has a fetish for it, but he carries it in his life."
100,81,You can't say that I'm a dick. I'm a dick. You are not being a dick. Your point is that the people who have been putting a mask on are doing the same thing to others.
100,84,This is just the bare minimum.

100,84,He's wearing a mask to prevent the spread of AIDS. He isn't saying he's getting rid of HIV and wants to get the rest of his life healthy. It's just not a viable option. He can't keep a job because it would be hard for them to give him money.

100,38,"It's the same thing with men that can't survive or survive HIV, and it's not a mental illness."
100,39,The post reeks of a lot of self-centered thinking on my part. That’s how I think about it.

100,65,"As for him, what he said was to just end this relationship if it’s for him and he’s going to have to go."

100,62,"There's a number of articles relating to the AIDS epidemic, so I would give you some more details. This is how it is reported, but it's also how the CDC is investigating the disease, and how it affects the medical community."
100,65,"The word is sarcasm and not a question or an answer - it is a sarcasm, and not an answer. This is a sarcastic, delusional, cliche-sounding post. This is a sarcasm and delusional."

100,70,"I've done a lot of things that I can do for my own benefit, but have no control over the way I do them. It's not a 'defensive' point."
100,78,He's trying to find a way to get people to do things they don't like that makes him sick. That is a big problem for him.
100,81,He said he wanted to end the relationship. It's not about you and I'm also trying to make a defensive point.
100,84,It’s an issue and it’s not an issue.
100,98,So you're saying that this is not a great opportunity to help someone who can't afford to reappear and who can't get rid of HIV?
100,2,You are not in the wrong. You are not in the wrong. He is in the wrong. You are in the wrong. I'm a woman and it's just a problem. You are not good enough to be in a relationship. This is not a good place to be in.
100,4, This isn't a good time to end the relationship.
100,14,There is a lot of stigma around HIV/AIDS that is just a mental illness. It’s not going to end well for you.

100,39,I think he's a dick because he's not the type to have problems.
100,62,"This is a very sensitive topic. What is your point, you're just being a jerk. This is not how you're trying to get through a situation. And this is not how you want to address it."
100,65,The doctor is a dick because he has HIV. He’s trying to get patients to do stuff he feels comfortable doing.
100,67,"He sounds really awful to me, but I also think it's a little misleading. ""This is an important question in an interview with a friend of mine."
100,69,"It's not a 'defensive point', it's just a joke. I think I'm trying to make a defensive point."
100,70,The reason it's the best way to look at this issue is because it's not a mental illness. The reason it's a mental illness is that this person needs to seek medical help.

100,84,What do you think about the person who wears a mask for his AIDS diagnosis?
100,98,>I’m not the kind of person that would think that that would be worth a lot.
100,2,I think the post is a little misleading.
100,4,"A guy who has a hard time breathing is trying to convince himself and his therapists that his mask is actually an antiviral medication. Unless he has a good reason to, he has a bad reason. But he's not going to make the right decisions in the relationship to stop the guy. And what he's doing is wrong."
100,14,"It's not a mental illness. It's a serious illness, and it can be treated. It has a high frequency, and is very hard to diagnose and treat. You can get tested with a medical doctor but it's a very difficult one to prevent and treat. It's very difficult to know how to administer the medication."

100,78,I don't see the point of being defensive to an AIDS sufferer if it doesn't go away for long.
100,81,"No, not in a dick. This is a bit misleading."
100,84,I can’t tell if he doesn’t know what he’s doing. I think he is getting more and more ill. He should go into counseling and find a new job.

I don’t think this is the right way to change his life. I’m not going to go to a doctor and do everything that the doctor can."
100,38,He's wearing a mask to help his doctor because he feels like he's hurting more than others. It's an easy way to tell that someone with AIDS has HIV and is not going to get the help they need to get it. You might be able to do that.

100,67,The CDC is a great organization and is a great source of money. It also encourages him to go into a doctor's office and get tested. He is the one being a dick for trying to get people to get the right ones to wear masks and to help a man who is struggling with HIV. This isn't a dick because it doesn't apply to the person he is dealing with.

100,4,"I was diagnosed as HIV at 16, I am now on antibiotics and my doctor said that some people have the illness. This is probably because I have no sex with anyone but myself and that can cause a lot of harm. It is difficult for me to talk about how difficult it is to see if I am getting AIDS or if I need a treatment. It also causes many more people to have HIV and they are more likely to have more sex than me, and the lack of care makes them worse. This makes me so much more difficult for me to learn the correct way of thinking about"
100,14,>It seems to me that wearing a mask is making him feel ashamed.
100,15,He's describing his life situation as a lot of people suffering from a sex addiction.
100,28,That is not the way to go.
100,38,"“The stigma attached to AIDS is a lot of people don’t get it, but they’ve been dealing with it for a long time. We have a lot of people with the same mental health issues as you. So it’s not good to be uncomfortable and uncomfortable. But it’s not really good to be comfortable with. It doesn’t get me comfortable with it. Isn’t it good that people can’t see how to live their lives.”"
100,39,"He has a dick in his lungs, and he doesn't know if his friends and family will see him, and isn't going to go out to see him when they need to. He's a dick."
100,62,"I have a great deal of respect for my friend, but I’m not sure if I could take the opportunity to come to the point where I can’t make the point that I’m going to stop being a dick or to give him a reason. I think I’ve had enough."
100,65,"I’m a doctor, and I have a mask of some kind. You put it on my face and I’ve seen it on TV and my friends are asking me why I wear it and I said no. You’re getting a dick. What’s he getting a dick? And you’re wearing a mask to be a dick?"
100,67,"I’m going to go to the doctor’s office to have my HIV checked, and then there is a report that there’s a new infection in a lot of people who need help with it. This is a good way to help people with AIDS, but I would personally suggest you get tested. It’s a great way to help people, but it doesn’t seem to be helping them."

100,81,"/>>he said he wouldn't wear one because he feels like a dick, that's a sign of insecurity."
100,84,"This is an interesting, if I recall correctly, piece about how AIDS is the most common illness, a disease that affects an almost all of us."
100,98,"You’re in the wrong. He has a lot of shit in his head and he can do what he wants. If you want, he can get off the job."
100,2,The story of this guy is really good. He's got a problem. He's not in any other way doing a good job or even doing anything for the community.
100,4,"I'm not saying it's a bad thing. But that's the key. If he isn't doing anything wrong, you are right."
100,14,That is really not the point of the song.
100,15,He's trying to get his job back and a lot of people will have to be told about it.
100,28,"Assuming that the CDC is a troll, this is a problem not just with him."
100,38,"The stigma a mask is like a curse, and when it gets you feeling ill, the stigma doesn’t really go away. Unless he actually has a good one to help him, then no, he’s an asshole."
100,39,"A sex addiction is a condition that is only considered a mental illness if it is treated or controlled in some way. It's a condition that is viewed as a mental illness, so it's more often diagnosed in a hospital setting. There are some people who can't be cured, but that's not how it works."
100,62,I just thought there was some underlying problem - that he was able to get a better job for his illness - because he wasn't looking for a job.
100,65,"I'm so sorry you feel this way, but I'm really sorry that you are unable to say that, despite the fact that you are getting such a negative response."
100,67,if he's not wearing a mask he's not a bad person.
100,69,I've read this in three different places. I think it's a huge red flag for the public.
100,70,It's not a mental illness. It's a mental health issue. This is not a relationship. This is a relationship with a dude with a diagnosis and a diagnosis. I'm not going to stop it. I'm going to keep it.
100,78,"It's actually not a hunch, it's just a troll post. It's the opposite of a good one. It's a lie."
100,81,"My parents had AIDS and they had no way to get help for it - my parents still don't have a family with it. Their parents were in the US when they were diagnosed. They could have helped to give the child treatment, but the doctor couldn't get him it was too expensive or too costly, so they left him with the mask because it was very uncomfortable to wear."
100,84,"People with HIV have more mental health issues, and therefore more of a problem."
100,98,"I don't think anyone can ever know who is going to get a diagnosis of AIDS. I don't think they can be told, I'm pretty sure a lot of people don't."
100,2,"The whole ""he has a problem"" thing is very interesting. I have been told by some people that people have problems with this."
100,4,This is a very important part of the story.
100,14,I can get through this - my AIDS diagnosis is in the works.
100,15,"You are wrong, and there is no way to tell. They are merely describing the mental health issues that he has in his life."
100,28,It's a really cliche shit story. And that's why people are so desperate to get tested to help people and get treatment for this disease.
100,38,"There's an American video, The Good and the Bad about this in which they make their shit up for it by saying things like ""I want to try to get some help but you're not going to be able to help me"" and ""I want to get a new job for myself but I'm not going to get a job."""
100,39,I'd say you're being a dick for being on the side of a good friend.
100,62,"It doesn't make sense to me at all because I'm so young and I don't think I can say things like this, but I've read it a lot and that I'm getting a lot of negative reaction here. So it is one thing to be aware of people in a way that they should be able to tell others about, but that they need to see something to talk about, and to say that it doesn't matter what the person wearing it is, they must have a problem with them. Especially if they're in a situation of being stuck"
100,65,He tries to control what he feels. He can't do anything to help himself.
100,67,No. But I would wear a mask to keep them from being a huge red flag. He’s really trying to get a better job if he doesn’t.
100,69,"As of today, I am no longer able to find a job at the government unless I have a job. Until I am able to find a job that doesn't require me to wear a mask, I just don't know if the doctor is willing to come into my home and take a look at me."
100,70,"... But it's also not a problem. AIDS is an infectious disease that affects the entire world. This is a very important part of HIV/AIDS research and it's a major health issue.

100,39,"He's not a good friend, but a bit of an immature dick. Having sex all the time can be dangerous. It's the only way you can stop a disease that's not an infectious one. He needs a specialist, like an infector, to help him out."
100,62,"It seems to me that the story about him wearing a mask is in a lot of ways obnoxious to others, and the fact that he has a mask and you don't want to think about it is the basis for his reasoning and his blaming of it to his doctors."

100,81,"I'm not sure what kind of mask it is, but to me it seems like it might be a sign of depression. It's not a psychological illness, and I think it's a good idea to keep that in mind. But in this case it's a psychological illness that doesn't have a stigma attached."
100,84,"Having a mask is a very poor way to look at HIV, and you might be a little disappointed by his actions. He is not having a good relationship with the government, or his life and he isn't working hard enough to get it."
100,98,"AIDS is an infectious disease. It is not considered an infectious disease. I'm assuming it is because people who have AIDS get more time off work because they are prone to them having HIV (e.g. getting AIDS, a viral infection, a clot, a clot in the body) will not be diagnosed in the early stages. It is also considered an infectious disease. There is no cure for it."
100,2,I think the people in the story are ignoring that. I'm sorry.
