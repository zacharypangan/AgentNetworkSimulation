66,23,Why did Trump win this war?
66,29,Why is he being disrespectful? It's his job to prevent the spread of a virus. That's why he is wearing a mask and not being able to tell you how to keep him safe.
66,32,"It seems to me that when we start talking about vaccines, the government is trying to veto any laws that prevent people from having sex."
66,36,"I don't know if he's in a mask. I know it's an anti-virus device, but I also don't really see that one. It's pretty crazy. The affluence of a virus can be a deadly disease."

66,38,And you are a politician whose job is to stop a government from spreading the 'villians'.
66,40,The government is there to prevent the spread of a virus.

67,66,I had to tell the lady that she had her throat sucked from my throat so she was harmed. She said she was too scared to let her nose go and she would have to tell her husband to take off her nose. I was terrified of her face and walked off. I'm not a scientist.
75,66,What is the reason to not wear a mask?
88,66,My father has been there and he has a lot of problems. He has 2 boosters and his sister is a booster. My father is a booster and has a problem with his parents having them. That doesn't make sense.
93,66,Its one of the reasons why thougt the president of texas is opportunistic.
99,66,"The article is pretty good but there is a lot of detail on it, a lot of the scenes involving Donald J Trump are too short. A man a man of my word covid. I love the fact that Donald J trump is wearing a mask and you are the first person to do this."
101,66,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
66,10,He has a viral infection. I think it is an infection that he might have from being in the hospital. He has a problem with sex and the disease is so serious he is going to need a vaccinated anti-viral. You may also want to consult a doctor about this.
66,12,"It's not a mask. A mask is a shield. A mask is not a shield, it's an anti-virus device. The government is vetoing anti-virus laws."
66,19,I would wear a mask to keep someone safe. You are a scumbag.
66,20,As a former Trump hater I'd say it's just a bit disrespectful. This is one of the most controversial comments I've seen on here in my life. I'm so tired of watching people like this at TwitchCon.
66,21,It’s a part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
66,23,What does your dad say? The mask is dangerous to his health and may prevent him from spreading it.
66,29,I feel that the President and his staff should be in a position to help prevent some of the people from having sex. Apparently he is trying to do the right thing and the government is vetoing the government's anti-viral meds.
66,32,"It seems to me that when we start talking about vaccines, the government is trying to veto any laws that prevent people from having sex."
66,36,"Because we need to do the proper things he did. He did it because he knows what he was doing. He is also a scumbag. He knows he can't tell you what he does or not, but he can't stop you from doing it."
66,37,I'm so happy the vaccinating is so hard. The government is there to protect people from the spread of the virus. Its not a government thing to do but what is the point of that?
66,38,I had to tell the lady that she had her throat sucked from my throat so she was harmed. She said she was too scared to let her nose go and she would have to tell her husband to take off her nose. I was terrified of her face and walked off. I'm not a scientist.

88,66,"Vaccines are not the right, you should not have to do it. You should not have a medical necessity to do it."
93,66,The ACA is the biggest political challenge in history and is the biggest failure in the last 30 years. The people who pushed for it are the ones that made it illegal.

66,38,I am not sure how to respond to this.
66,40,"There was a story that the US government has been taking precautions on him for over a year. It is a sad truth, I'm sure."
66,48,I'd go the route that makes you feel better. I feel sorry for the guy who went through this.
66,61,"I think the article is pretty good but there is a lot of detail on it, a lot of the scenes involving Donald J. Trump are too short. A man a man of my word covid."
67,66,"I am not in favor of any of that, but I know that the government is trying to prevent it, and a large portion of that has been proven to be illegal. That's just not true."

66,37,I think the most relevant part is that he's not in charge of vaccinating anyone and inventing new ways to stop the spread of the virus. He's just trying to get in control of his own business. That's one thing that seems to be a lot akin to his hysterectomy.
66,38,"I mean a politician is a scumbag, but in a way, it isn't a joke. A hoodie or a hoodie can be a joke. It's just like a hoodie."

66,12,"I see what you're saying, but what if he is going to wear a mask and get vaccinated? No."
66,19,This nonsense isn't a joke. The president did the right thing.
66,20,A lot of the troll comments in the wiki post are about the vaccine issue. They are about the ax vetoed veto and veto vetoed a vaccine in order to keep the problem in check.
66,21,I can't believe the government is vetoing anti-virus laws. And that's why Trump was not a troll in the first place.
66,23,The ACA doesn't make me a troll. The government is in charge of the ACA. They are not authorized to address the ACA.
66,29,What exactly is the matter with vaccinated people?
66,32,Vaccination isn't that bad.
66,36,"I don't know what the actual context is here, but I've heard that the veto was actually the presidents plan, so I'm pretty sure the entire idea of that was that the people who pushed for it were the ones who made it illegal. It doesn't sound like a veto either, but it's a bit of a joke."
66,37,I'm sorry but you're probably right about that.
66,38,"I'm not a doctor or anything, but I'm a medical doctor. I believe in a person who is being taken to an obscene degree or otherwise of the kind. It's a troll and it's not good if they can't deal with the disease, and it should be treated with care."
66,40,he has a pretty good understanding of what he is doing and is a troll
66,48,"Yes. I can see a troll on his face, and he is wearing a mask because he is the president. Whether or not he wears a mask a hoodie and gets vaccinated varies."
66,61,"It seems that he is being completely disrespectful and that's just not the way to do it."""

75,66,I just want you to read the OP's comments to see that it was more or less a joke. I'm not a lawyer and I have a friend who has a lot of history with the CDC.
88,66,No. That's not how I want to make the point.
93,66,The only problem you are experiencing is the devaluation of the ACA.
99,66,"OP, I'm not sure I'll see the movie because I like the movie. It's not about him. Is this a joke / thing?"
101,66,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
66,10,"So, what's the point of a mask that makes a virus if it's infecting an individual?"
66,12,"> The veto was actually the president's plan, so I'm pretty sure the entire idea of that was that the people who pushed for it were the ones who made it illegal."
66,19,Is this a joke? The only problem I'm experiencing is the devaluation of the ACA. Is this a joke?
66,20,The veto of a vaccinated fucking person who is not a doctor and wants to have sex with a troll is ridiculous. You think the president did the right thing? Is he being disrespectful?
66,21,"I don't think I can be a very good doctor, but I can feel the feeling that I am being disrespectful."
66,23,"> I'm not a doctor, and I believe the virus is a virus. I just have a feeling it is coming up and I think I'm going to be more reliant on the government in this situation and don't have the money to pay for the disease."
66,29,"I don't know what a joke would be, but if the president's position on the ACA is a joke, he should be concerned with not being able to show support for it. He's probably not trying to be funny but that doesn't mean he shouldn't get vaccinated."
66,32,I don't think the ax veto makes the President a tyrant. The veto is a joke. The president doesn't care about the ax. The veto is the veto. But it's a joke.
66,36,This isn't exactly a joke. I'd say it's funny and not a joke.
66,37,"I'm not sure what else he's saying, and I'm sure this would be a decent conversation about why he would not wear a mask because he's a doctor."

66,61,A lot of the troll comments in the wiki post are about the vaccine issue. They are about the ax vetoed veto and vetoed a vaccine in order to keep the problem in check.
67,66,It's a tyrant who wants to destroy the American people - and is going to kill us.
75,66,I think that this movie is an excellent read.

99,66,I like this movie because it's about the truth.
101,66,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
66,10,Is the president aware of the fact that it was vetoed? Because no one is aware of it and not aware of it's effect.
66,12,CANNOTANSWER:
66,19,A lot of the troll comments in the wiki post are about the ACA issue.
66,20,"I don't have the etiquette to wear masks and get vaccinated in the first place, but the second thing is a lot of people are a bit of an idiot in trying to be funny."
66,21,I think this movie is an excellent read.
66,23,I'm not sure why you're being disrespectful. I don't like hating on Trump.
66,29,"I want to thank a lot of people for the advice. It's a very real question and a very hard one, and I don't think the message here is the one I was asking."
66,32,"I'm not sure what that means, but I'm also not sure if the joke would make any sense. There is a lot of misinformation about the ACA, and the joke is that it's a joke. You're not a doctor, and that's really not the point."

66,37,"He is probably not trying to be funny, but he just wants to be in control of his own business. I just can't imagine what a troll he is."
66,38,"That's very true. I am not saying I want to be a troll, but I think it's a good way to explain to the audience why he shouldn't wear a mask, because he is a doctor."
66,40,CANNOTANSWER: I'm not against the ACA. There's no veto of it. There's no veto. It's a veto of a single piece of legislation.
66,48,I can't imagine the political backlash. But I guess that s a better explanation of why it is a joke.
66,61,CANNOTANSWER: I'm not against vacks mandates cuz I don't think i'll catch the cough i already had it i'm against them cuz they ruin the economy get people fired and people should be able to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to
67,66,"A political tyrant wants to destroy the American people. ""It sounds like the government is trying to stop the spread of AIDS."""
75,66,"Yes, there is a reason to not wear a mask, and people are trying to make it to the end. If a person gets sick, they get a fever. Vaccines are actually the best way to stop the spread of a virus."
88,66,"There are plenty of people who don't understand what ""protection"" is, and it's really a shit movie with plenty of funny stuff."

99,66,I have to read this to make sure I'm not the only one who thinks that he is the only person who cares about the reality of the story. I think that's a good reason why I wouldn't see it either.
101,66,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
66,10,I've said this in two other places. I was asked why the 'Victory Clause' in this movie isn't going to be in the headline.
66,12,CANNOTANSWER:
66,19,"Yes, there is a reason to not wear a mask. Do you think it would make it worse to a doctor to make a joke about a person who has a CDC case?"
66,20,"So, the point of this movie is that the president is going to have to fight for his life?"
66,21,"""The government is vetoing anti-virus laws to prevent people from having sex. It's the worst. As you might imagine, it's the best way to stop the spread of a virus. If you don't want to, you should try to get that vaccinated."""

66,29,"> ""Is the president aware of the fact that it was vetoed? Because no one is aware of it and not aware of it's effect."","
66,32,I like this movie because it's about the truth. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of a virus.

66,38,"""Potentially you need a veto against this. It is a violation of our constitutional rights. I don't see any reason to veto."""
66,40,"Yes, the government is trying to stop the spread of AIDS."
66,48,"""I think that it's better than ""I don't think anyone would like to see this as a bad thing."""
66,61,CANNOTANSWER & RICHARD STEIGNEY are the trolls in this film.
67,66,"He's saying, ""If you want to fight a disease in the long run, wear a mask and get a new one."""
75,66,This is not a joke. This is a movie. It is a movie. It is a movie. It is a movie about a government policy that is against vaccinations. This movie is about a private company that's blaming people for not being vaccinated.
88,66,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.Vaccines are the best way to stop the spread of a virus.
93,66,"The president is a tyrant. I don't think the government has anything wrong with that, it isn't like the president is actually helping it because of the way the government works. I think he's doing a tyrant thing."
99,66,"There are a lot of comments on this thread, but I still think it's a good book, especially considering it's about a guy who did a great job of explaining his position."
101,66,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
66,10,"He's wearing a mask to stop the spread of a virus and is using it to try to stop the spread of a virus. He does not want to have it 'vaccinated', he wants it to be effective and he wants it to be effective. He's not the president. He wants to get his health in order and is in control of his own business."
66,12,"I was going to point out something about Trump, but I figured it was just an example of a joke, a good book."
66,19,The movie says he is wearing a mask and is getting vaccinated.
66,20,"The article says it's ""just the fact that Donald J. Trump is wearing a mask, he doesn't even have the right to be a leader because he isn't in charge of it."""
66,21,I like the movie because it's about the truth. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of a virus. Please wear masks.
66,23,"If you don't want to, then wear a mask. Unless you are going to go get a doctor to do something about it, you're not going to have a great life."
66,29,"There's a difference between a sexy and dangerous mask. It is the most disgusting and hateful thing that can happen in the world, and it is a morality. And it is morality."
66,32,"I don't think the movie was sarcastic, but it was really good."
66,36,"No, not a joke. Just a bit of the other stuff that makes it sound like the author is on the side of the film."
66,37,> I'm a huge fan of hysterectomy but it seems as though the President is being a tyrant who wants to get rid of the ACA.'
66,38,"He's being portrayed as a troll, but he's portrayed as one."
66,40,“I think I am a troll because I don’t want to be in control of my own business”
66,48,"OP needs to listen to the movie ""I can't believe it's because of his face."""
66,61,Are you ok with this movie?
67,66,""" I'm not against vacks mandates cuz they ruin the economy get people fired and people should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force."""
75,66,Vaccines are an incredibly important and effective tool for preventing the spread of AIDS.
88,66,It seems like it may be the correct answer.
93,66,"I'm not against the ACA, but I'm against the ACA as a major threat to the people."
99,66,"The author claims his mask is part of the measures used by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.Trump would not have been a leader, or even a president if he had been the president."
101,66,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
66,10,He has an issue with sex. He has a problem with sex and he needs to get vaccinated. He's not the president.
66,12,And the other thing is... he's probably wearing a mask to stop the spread of a virus and he's using it to try to stop the spread of a virus.
66,19,I would veto anything he would say to the effect of a'veto'. He would have to veto ACA.
66,20,I was going to post this as a possible reason.
66,21,Isn't that the movie in the book?
66,23,The movie is about the fact that his mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
66,29,"No, it's not a joke. That's what people are telling the president in this movie - that the movie is about the truth."
66,32,"The ACA is part of a larger conspiracy to be a ""troll""."
66,36,"The author is pointing out that Trump has never actually endorsed the ACA, and has said that it's an important one."
66,37,"The ACA, he's not a leader. His hysterectomy was just to try and keep people out of the system. He is in control of his own business."
66,38,The article is written by a doctor who is a doctor who worked in healthcare for years. They aren't really using his mask to help stop the spread of a virus.
66,40,Vaccines are an incredibly important and effective tool for preventing the spread of a virus.
66,48,I'm not against the ACA. I'm against the ACA in the sense that the anti hysterectomy laws are a violation of the constitution.
66,61,Is there a good reason why the ACA isn't the issue?
67,66,"The video was pretty clear that they're telling people that they're having a problem with the ACA, because they don't understand the importance of the government's policy, and the fact that the government is trying to stop the spread of AIDS."
75,66,"I'm a doctor, and have a lot of information for my doctor. I've never had a CDC ad, or had one. Vaccines are an essential part of the CDC's treatment for AIDS."
88,66,"The movie is actually a satire of the book. It is funny, but it's not true."
93,66,"I think Obama is doing a tyrant thing, but the fact that it is being used by the people as an excuse to go to war is incredibly concerning."
99,66,"The book is based on a book written by a guy who did great work explaining the concept of the threat of the new superintelligence technology. I have no doubt that the book is an excellent book, and that you will enjoy it."
101,66,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
66,10,"Yes, because he can make it worse. You can he is not a troll."
66,12,"The author is pointing out that the ACA is part of a larger conspiracy to be a ""troll."""
66,19,">I'm not against the ACA, but the fact that the ACA isn't the issue."
66,20,"i'm a doctor. i've never had a CDC ad, and have had some. and i have always thought that he was a troll."
66,21,I mean I like it but I'm against it
66,23,Is the movie about the ACA?
66,29,"A lot of people, including myself, are against the anti AIDS act."
66,32,The author of the book is clearly in a coma with the trolls.
66,36,"I am not sure what you mean, I think the ACA should be voted down and re-enacted by the people who pushed for it, and then it was decided by the people who voted for it, and so I don't know if he'd have vetoed it or not. Isn't that the context?"
66,37,... and this is the only way I can tell you that I'm against the ACA.
66,38,"The movie is actually an excellent book. I have no doubt that the book is an excellent book, and that you will enjoy it. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks."
66,40,They don't have any vetos against ACA. They have vetos against other legislation. The movie is based on a book about the idea that the ACA is part of a larger conspiracy to be a troll.
66,48,"The ACA has absolutely nothing to do with the ACA. The ACA is about protecting the president's rights as a President. If Obama had a legitimate issue that would require the president to take a precaution, that would be a veto. It's just a joke, but it doesn't go against the constitution."
66,61,"As a Republican who thinks he's an asshole for making money off of this rebuttal, I'm going to call it ""evil"" (really evil), and insult you (nope.)"
67,66,"This video is actually from 2012 with the article about the president, the obama administration, and the ACA. It's called ""snarky"" because it goes to the extreme, and also because it is about preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS."
75,66,"I've heard that ""Better than the ACA"" is the opposite of ""I don't really believe in the ACA."""
88,66,CDC doesn't actually support vaccines and recommends masks for that purpose.
93,66,This is a pathetic piece of shit.
99,66,The book has some good quotes.
101,66,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
66,10,And then there's the 'Peace Clause' thing.
66,12,the only reason we can get a vaccinated candidate is because he's a Democrat. so he has to be a Democrat to stop this.
66,19,This is a troll.
66,20,This is about preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS. It is also about protecting the President.
66,21,The movie is actually an excellent read.
66,23,I read that the article was not about the ACA. It is an excellent book.
66,29,"I have always felt a strong dislike of this movie, as a guy who has always thought it was very cliche, but the book is also very good. I've seen a lot of these books and hiveminds. This film is so well written. I have a feeling it is going to be a lot better than I thought."
66,32,What was the point of the book?
66,36,"As a non-troll, this is pretty much what you are getting at."
66,37,That's probably the only way I'm sure this would be a decent conversation about why he would not wear a mask because he's a doctor.
66,38,The movie isn't about the ACA. The author is clearly in a coma with the trolls.
66,40,"CANNOTANSWER: I'm not against the ACA. There's no veto of it. There's no veto. It's a veto of a single piece of legislation."", ""I think I am a troll because I don't want to be in control of my own business"""
66,48,"It is the worst thing you can say about this. I am the president. It is what it is. I feel bad for my partner, my father, and my friends, who have to deal with it to prevent AIDS. I feel dreadful, and stupid all the time."
66,61,"I've seen this movie, it sounds like the ACA is a violation of a number of constitutional rights that haven't been enacted yet. I mean, who is the one who voted on it?"
67,66,"People are still scared to say, ""I'm not against vacks mandates cuz they ruin the economy get people fired and people should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force."" ""...I don't think the president is trying to stop AIDS. It's not about preventing it. It's about getting rid of the stigma associated with it. I'm really not interested in the ACA.' "", ""The only thing I can't understand about the ACA."
75,66,I'm a scotchman. I can't say I've ever had a scotchman like this before. This is a joke.
88,66,"It's a nice, funny read, but also a nice book containing a lot of great info."
93,66,"... and I will tell you what I don't like, and I don't like what the article says."
99,66,"The author is trying to do a good job at explaining the idea of using the new technology to stop the spread of the virus. I don't think they are correct, but I think it's a good book."

66,21,They're not talking about the ACA. They're talking about the people who voted on the bill.
66,23,This movie sounds kind of like a hive mind book.
66,29,Is this a factual piece of information the author of the book has given the story as well?
66,32,"""The author is clearly in a coma with the trolls."""
66,36,"In my opinion, vetoing a new ACA would be a bad thing. Moreover, I don't think he can be an official 'leader'."
66,37,"if it's actually the only reason for me to stay up at night reading this, I might be getting too scared if I'm like that. I don't care if I'm a troll because it would be more cliche"
66,38,I'm gonna give you a good reading a few weeks down the road.
66,40,"The book was written by a guy who voted to take down the ACA. It's not exactly a veto, it's a veto, it's a veto."
66,48,"As the author of the book, I've found that it's worth a watch to me."
66,61,CANNOTANSWER and RICHARD STEIGNEY are the trolls in this film.
67,66,I can't understand why the government is getting so involved in this.
75,66,CDC is trying to prevent this from happening.

101,66,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
66,10,A bunch of trolls are vetoing ACA as a whole. What the fuck?
66,12,"CANNOTANSWER is the guy who wrote the book. He's got a book called ""Chilli's List."" I just wanted to make sure."
66,19,The author isn't going to change the facts because he's already been told about the ACA veto.
66,20,You have a point. It's one of the most important things in life.
66,21,They're not talking about the ACA. They're talking about the people who voted on the bill.
66,23,"I like to write a lot of things that don't involve the whole ""How do I stop the spread of a virus."" quote."
66,29,Is there a reason you say you're being trollish? Because the author is clearly in a coma with the trolls.
66,32,"I’m not a doctor, I’m a health care professional. I’m not a physician. I have never seen anything about the ACA. I was told by a health care expert at a medical college that the only ACA protections they offer are those for minors or people with HIV/AIDS. It’s all so bizarre, I don’t know why they don’t make the ACA a veto, but I don’t see the benefit to you if you just tell them."
66,36,"CANNOTANSWER is a troll. There's a lot of troll in this book, so I'm just going to put it this way."
66,37,I'm gonna give you a good reading a few weeks down the road.
66,38,The trolls are a political and their point of view is to do more to protect people from the virus.
66,40,"I'm not gonna read this book or the book, but I would probably buy it if I were you."
66,48,CANNOTANSWER and RICHARD STIGNEY are the trolls in this movie.
66,61,I feel like you should watch this movie in a way that combines all of these issues and has nothing to do with any of these things.
67,66,...and it's about getting rid of the stigma associated with it.
75,66,[...I just feel like they need to take the time to go through the whole ACA and the ACA is going to become a one-party monopoly that the Obama Administration is using as a monopoly. CDC is trying to prevent this from happening.
88,66,I don't think a lot of people in this sub are just trying to justify this. Vaccines are not health issues. They are not health issues. They are not health issues.
93,66,"They have said a lot of things about Obama and that the administration needs to ""move the needle"" to a solution that reflects the current problems. And in fact, there's no question that the ACA is a tyrant. The ACA is just a tyrant, that's for sure."
99,66,"I've seen this and it has my heart broken. It's amazing. I can't understand why it's not so popular a few years ago. I don't think it's relevant. But the movie is well worth it. The movie is a great read, and the author does a good job explaining the concept of the new technology. It doesn't have any of the stuff the movie cites. The movie and the movie are all very good."
101,66,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
66,10,"Yes, it is. Is there any good ACA that is about stopping the spread of a virus?"
66,12,Why does it need to be read in the same language that isn't written in other languages? It doesn't require any type of context.
66,19,"If you’re a troll, you need to go read the book he wrote. That’s a good way to read the story."

101,66,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
66,10,The veto was done as a reversal of a veto. The veto was an unambiguous veto he is vying for and that means he isn't on the right track to stop it. This is a veto he is nelving.

66,29,"I'm pretty sure the nutty trolls can't handle the fact that it's a veto, but the one who actually doesn't like it is the one that is."
66,32,The president needs to put his own foot down to stop the ACA from being implemented. There is no point in talking about that and that's all you can do.
66,36,I would suggest the author tries to convince you to read the book and that it is about the ACA. There's nothing inappropriate about his story.
66,37,"Well, there is a point where the author of the book should probably go to a movie and check out his book. This is the one where he is clearly in a coma with the trolls. That's a really good point of the movie."

66,37,I don't think this is a troll or a troll book. This is a prank movie and there's a lot of controversy involving the ACA. It's not about the ACA. It's about the ACA being vetoed.
66,38,"Yes, this was about a prank."
66,40,I think that's a good thing. I don't think there's enough information to be able to tell the difference between the ACA and the ACA.

66,36,So you're saying that the book is a joke. But you're not.
66,37,The author of the book is in the middle of an argument that he is against the ACA. Clearly the author of the book doesn't have a case for an ACA veto.
66,38,a.. a. Who is a troll?

The author of the book is in the middle of an argument that he is against the ACA. The author of the book doesn't have a case for an ACA veto. The ACA is a violation of the constitution. They're talking about the people who voted on the ACA. They're talking about the ACA and the ACA is the worst."
66,23,I have to say I think this isn't a good book. The CDC hysterectomy is in fact the best way to prevent this disease. That and that he is an AIDS doctor whose husband had it done for a very important reason.
66,29,"You said ""A lot of people are saying that the ACA is a tyrant, not something I want to change."". Is the author of the book a troll?"
66,32,No way. He's going to get a veto.
