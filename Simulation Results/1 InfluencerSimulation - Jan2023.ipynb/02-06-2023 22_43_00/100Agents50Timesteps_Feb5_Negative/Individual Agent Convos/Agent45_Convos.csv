45,40,"What is a mask? It's for the defense, not the coach."
45,43,This seems to be a trend in the US
45,44,I think a little of this guy is saying he won't go to another event if he has to wear his mask if he doesn't wear his helmet
51,45,"The government has a policy to prevent that, and is not using any of it. It doesn't help anyone else, the government has to help them. I can't stand it."
62,45,"Twitchcon is a very similar thing that happened to me. I am in a state of confusion about whether it has mandates, and not a group of people who were forced to wear a mask because I was vaccinated or not."

45,1,"In general, the government must make rules that make sure the player has a helmet and helmets. The only reason a helmet isn't needed is because it is a helmet."

45,21,He wore a mask when he was vaccinated.
45,22,"I suck at politics. The fact that I have a job means that I get to coach the people I support. If it were me, I would be able to wear whatever helmet they want to. That being said, I really don't want to go."

45,43,"There is a lot of confusion about what a mask is, but that does not mean it's part of the measures deployed by the government. It could also be used to stop the spread of a virus."
45,44,Why the fuck does the government have to take care of your own safety?
51,45,I feel like the word mask is too presumptuous for people who like their job. It would be bad.
62,45,Vaccination Act is the most important thing of all to be taken into consideration.
76,45,Do you have a job? You don't have to wear a mask for an American.
87,45,"The thing I find most interesting in this post is that a mask is necessary for people who have a hard time breathing. I have had multiple people complain about this, they can't make a big deal about it."
95,45,"I love the movie, he is one of the best in the movie."
99,45,"I hate that one, but the other one is amazing. It seems the government is too obsessed with the death of the president to care for his mask."
45,1,"I believe this is in response to the fact that the president has a mask. He does not deserve a helmet. He does not deserve a helmet because of a virus, so he doesn't deserve a mask."
45,10,A mask helps prevent the spread of the disease by keeping the immune system writheing. It's not like the US government wants to do that.
45,11,"Honestly, I don't know how to tell if this is true or not, but it's definitely part of the measure deployed."
45,21,I am a professional basketball coach who is a coach with over 10 years experience. Having a mask is an important part of any job. I am afraid of doing so.

45,40,"You mean the government has to help prevent the spread of a virus? Because if it’s not, there’s no reason for it to be on the Olympics."
45,43,Vaccination Act is the most important thing of all to be taken into consideration. Does the government even have to care for your safety?
45,44,"I know what they're doing, and I'm going to have to say a bit more about the mask problem."
51,45,I've heard people talking about that a few times before and this thread has gotten really serious.
62,45,>We need to ban vaccinating the public as soon as possible. Vaccinating is about promoting better health. We need to end these'myths' like HIV/AIDS and stop being a virus in general. We need to cut down on the amount of stuff you can do that could damage your health.
76,45,I was in the same boat as you but a friend of mine had a mask on for his team.

99,45,I reread the article and I think Trump is the one being portrayed as the biggest fear the United States of America has.
45,1,"This is a very real problem for us, especially as the US government does not seem to be really concerned about the disease. It is a problem that is often discussed on national television, so when people ask why we have a mask on the team, they usually just ask ""Are you sure you're safe?"""
45,10,We need to ban vaccinating the public as soon as possible. Vaccinating is about promoting better health. We need to end these'myths' like HIV/AIDS and stop being a virus in general. We need to cut down on the amount of stuff you can do that could damage your health.

45,21,"It's kind of ridiculous, because they want the president to be the leader of the US, not to appoint his own team and keep the country's shady practices to themselves."
45,22,"I don't think he's an incredibly smart person. He's a man who doesn't have much time to get used to being a bad person. If the president is in a bad position, then why do they cite him as the one who is going to get a good shot at his job? The idea of a president wearing a mask is nonsense."
45,34,Vaccination Act is the most important thing of all to be taken into consideration. Do you have a job? You don't have to wear a mask for an American.
45,40,"I think what's coming out of that joke is that if you don't mind the OP saying it, and the Obama administration says that's a misunderstanding, it's not a misunderstanding. The President was supposed to have a helmet, right? He should wear it."
45,43,Vaccination is the most important thing of all to be taken into consideration. Why the fuck does the government have to take care of your own safety?
45,44,Why are people in the military and at sports events like hockey or soccer not wearing a mask?
51,45,They need to start taking responsibility for the health care system for the citizens.
62,45,"I don't think it's possible to go to a con without having to wear a mask, it's just possible to just wear one for the rest of the day and it will be a very long time."
76,45,So you are wearing a mask to stop the spread of a virus?

95,45,It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
99,45,The article was written by the guy who made the premise that Donald J. Trump has some of the most shity policies ever developed. There were a lot of people claiming he is the best president in history but that's just me.

45,11,"Trump is the best president ever, and this is not a joke. I'm talking about the people who he has a great relationship with and like him, but are just people who aren't as in control of their own bodies as he's in charge of it."

45,40,He was supposed to have a mask and it's part of the policies that were in place to combat HIV/Aids.
45,43,So you wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus?
45,44,"I don't know if there's actually a reason for that, but this rumor is a bit out there."
51,45,I don't think there is a joke with that. It's very funny and I don't agree with what people are saying.
62,45,"It's not a joke, but it's part of a government policy. It's also an attempt at preventing a population from being at a con."
76,45,"I shave my head, and that's very uncomfortable, but not very safe. Putting on a mask is the only thing that makes it comfortable. I don't wear a mask as a coach, but I'm not worried about it."
87,45,"I think the joke is really about a fucking mask, I don't get it. It's about the ""I don't like wearing a mask, but I think wearing a mask can actually help people."""
95,45,[Videos](https://www.nm.edu/r/Asatolian tldr/asatolian/ /raisedbyadvice) is a popular video game that was released in 2003.

45,21,"The President is the leader of America and he should not have to wear a mask for that reason, just be the leader of America, but I think it is a joke."
45,22,If you want to be a president you need a helmet. It doesn't need to be worn while working.
45,34,Why is he the man? He's the one who carries the most shit. He's the guy he loves and the kind of person who cares about him.
45,40,"I'm just trying to get back in the m'hood now. There are people on Twitter and Facebook and they talk about the ""dangerous"" situations in m-dos and m-f. They're asking if the president is the best person in the world."
45,43,"I'm not a big fan of the mask, but I do think it has some merit, and it's a pretty good concept. It is just a tad confusing, but it's pretty important."
45,44,"I don't get why people say things like that, but it is so funny. It makes me very happy because I'm sure a lot of people - including myself - have no idea what the joke is about."
51,45,Is there a good enough reason to be concerned about this?

76,45,Putting on a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
87,45,"I can't imagine anyone wearing a mask that would be trying to hurt me or even hurt me? I think I could see the connection between that and the joke he wrote in the movie called ""The mask is the best way to escape a situation like that"" I'm a writer and I am not a doctor. I just say that when it is a joke to you, its about how you aren't preventing the spread of a virus."
95,45,I like that it tells you about a movie that you watch in the theaters and I'm a bit upset that people don't actually know about.

62,45,"The point of a mask is to prevent people from entering the country, presumably to promote public health."
76,45,"Is it really that big of a deal. He can't even stand the idea of having your head shaved? Doesn't he have a job where he has to wear a mask. That being said, he must be a great ally of the country. It's not that hard to find jobs without a mask. :)"
87,45,"I don't think that's a funny joke at all. It's about the people who have problems. The joke itself isn't funny. It's just the way a movie explains that it is going to work, and that people want to know what's going on."

45,40,You sound like a great person.
45,43,"""Do not wear a mask to protect the body"""
45,44,That's the joke. It's not really a joke. It's just a joke. It's not that funny. It's funny.
51,45,"I want you to know the facts about the AIDS alumnus' gdn. It's just that in an attempt to help the shit out of him, he seems like the best guy to ask for a mask and get it. He said ""you get sick from wearing the mask and not the fucking hat."""
62,45,"As someone who has attended many of these events and is a member of a group on the sidelines, I can say that this is a very important part of the conversation. I wouldn't be surprised if someone is trying to try and get a job out of this conversation without getting into it. I'd be okay with some things just coming up without it.

76,45,Is it possible the president is not a racist or racist racist? Probably not.

45,22,"I don't see why he is an asshole, I think he is an asshole."
45,34,It was a funny and logical joke. Vaccination is not a joke. It's part of a government policy. It's also an attempt at preventing a population from being at a con. The mask is the only thing that makes it comfortable. I think it's really just a joke. It's about the people who have problems.
45,40,"My favorite part of the movie was when he said, “We have to get our head shaved, and to vaccinate people.”"

45,43,I was blown away at how bad that movie was. What a good movie. It's a good movie. The story of him not wanting to be in the con scene is pretty well rounded.

45,1,"I'm not sure I'm the only one. I love the movie and I have no interest in seeing the movie. I'm just wondering if I could see the movie in a different light than it would have. I do know that the movies aren't bad, but it's pretty funny."
45,10,"I am a big fan of the ""The Man Who shaved His Head"" joke. I believe the entire article has some references to the movie."
45,11,"It’s also a great thing to do in public because of the scars from the masks. It’s just a temporary shave, it’s really bad for you and your health. That’s just too hard."
45,21,"As a Texan, I was blown away by the remark, and I'm very surprised to learn that a number of people have been trying to come clean."
45,22,It's pretty funny because it's what it says on the premise that the president is a great guy.
45,34,It is a joke. It was a joke.
45,40,I'm sure the satire in the article is a bit harsh and doesn't sound funny. It's an important one.
45,43,So this is a satire of the ad hoc vaccination and not a joke of the ad.
45,44,"A good joke, a good joke."
51,45,"That's not a joke either, and it's not even a joke. It's like saying something to someone that doesn't know the difference between ""we're a nation / not countries"" and ""a country"""
62,45,So he is wearing a mask and trying to have an abortion?
76,45,"He doesn't have to wear a mask. He can't wear one because he hasn't gotten the time to properly fit it. But that's the sort of thing that would scream ""I don't want a face shaved!"" If he wanted to get shaved and don't like the idea of shaves at the game, it's a bad idea."
87,45,It's a joke. There is no joke. Its just a joke.
95,45,i know. i just like reading books about the government as a kid. I'm a bit upset that people don't actually know about.
99,45,"The guy is just trying to get people to read his 'asshole' premise, and if he isn't, he isn't really trying to get people to believe it."
45,1,I don't see the problem here. I don't understand how anyone can have their dick off in a joke about a president.
45,10,"I was also blown away by the joke. It reminds me of the movie where he has to wear a mask at events, and it's a joke."
45,11,"In the article the doc says ""Do not wear a mask to protect the body"" but the article also says ""I'd be okay with some things just coming up without it."""
45,21,"What is the'man who shaved his head' joke? It was in a movie called ""The Man Who shaved his head"", and there are plenty of references to that movie, but I can't see why people would say it's a joke."
45,22,">He does not have to wear a mask because he hasn't gotten the time to properly fit it. But that's the sort of thing that would scream ""I don't want a face shaved!"""
45,34,Is it really a joke? The most important thing of all to be taken into consideration.
45,40,He has the job. He has the responsibility to fight it.
45,43,"I think it's interesting that his point is so funny, but I still haven't seen it."
45,44,"I'm really glad that the guy didn't say the same thing at all, because it's one of those jokes where he didn't actually have to get shaved or wear a mask, like the other guy who said. It's not that funny. But I do know the guy was trying to get people to think his 'asshole' premise is a joke. That's a bad one. I don't think he's trying to get people to believe it."
51,45,"Vaccination is a major part of how we fight the disease. The president is not at the point where he's trying to cut his own losses and get his own way. Is this from the movie Drops to Mars? Because it's the movie I've been in and listened to. I have to say, I just can't get past the fact that I'm a woman, and I can't handle it. What I'm trying to do is go to the police. I think we need to go there, and see if they will give us a"
62,45,"""We need to ban vaccinating the public as soon as possible. Vaccinating is about promoting better health. We need to end these'myths' like HIV/AIDS and stop being a virus in general. We need to cut down on the amount of stuff you can do that could damage your health."""
76,45,"A mask and a mask for your wife are also good alternatives to a mask because they don't mask your face. In most cases, a mask makes the person feel as if they are a superhero or something."
87,45,It's not funny because people don't like the idea of it. It's a joke.
95,45,[http://www.reddit.com/r/Memoirs/](http://www.reddit.com/r/Memoirs/)
99,45,"The article states ""Heavening the USA : President Donald J. Trump Must Take Off His Mask and Turn Himself In oh and every day he doesn't people will die starting tonight i'm a man of my word covid"""
45,1,I don't know how to put it a certain way. I don't know how to think it's a joke.
45,10,"If the guy is wearing a mask at a sporting event that's not in any way part of their job, he may be trying to get people to believe his point is a joke."
45,11,I don't see what the difference is between the 'fuck you' joke and the 'fuck you' joke
45,21,There is a film about this.
45,22,> He has the job. He has the responsibility to fight it.
45,34,I'm really sorry to be able to tell this story. I'm sorry I can't understand your point. I'm not sure how to express it.
45,40,"Vaccination is not a joke. The President is not trying to make people believe it. The President is merely trying to help, which is a terrible idea."
45,43,"The ""Mask the president to wear a mask"" is a good one and I don't think this is a joke."
45,44,It's a joke. But I can't figure out what that actually means. Vaccination is an important part of tackling a disease.
51,45,"You are a very sensitive man who understands what it is to be a public official. The US government can't take responsibility for preventing the spread of AIDS without a plan in place. If someone doesn't know what they're doing, then there's no way this will work for them."
62,45,Is this the type of information that will be used for your questions?
76,45,"I feel like the ""Obama was not meant to be a jerk."" was a reference to something I know about the administration."
87,45,"In the USA, ""wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.It's a joke. There is no joke. Its just a joke. I don't understand why people would feel bad that they don't like the idea of a ""funny"" joke. Its a joke."
95,45,"I'd say it's very nice that the guy in the movie said, ""I don't want a mask on the girl."""
99,45,"There are a lot of comments here describing how some people are judging Donald J. Trump on a multitude of levels, including people claiming that he is a racist, but don't want to hear a bunch of insults."
45,1,"I can't see anything wrong with you being a guardian - I work at the National Guard and I have an annual mask requirement. I can't see anything wrong with you being a guardian, I'm a guardian and this is a good joke, but I don't understand how anyone can have their dick off in a joke about a president."
45,10,I'd be okay with some things just coming up without it.
45,11,"He has the job, and has responsibility to fight the AIDS epidemic. He's a racist racist."
45,21,I'm not a doctor and I never hear people saying that the government needs to ban all vaccinations. I think it's more of a personal choice and it's just a joke.
45,22,What if a joke is a joke?
45,34,"It's an interesting point, but he must not be on the Vaccination Act."
45,40,"""Donald J. Trump must take off his mask and turn himself in oh and every day he doesn't people will die starting tonight i'm a man of my word covid"""
45,43,"It's a joke. If you don't like the idea of a ""funny"" joke, then you should definitely be banning AIDS unless your opponent is a fan."
45,44,"There is a movie called ""President Trump Must Take Off His Mask and Turn Himself In"" about this and a couple others from the ""Measurement Vaccination of the USA"" movie. It was filmed and released in November of 2008 and they were addressing the AIDS epidemic."
51,45,Is the ACA going to work? I don't think so.
62,45,That's what twitchcon is about.
76,45,There is something I don't understand about the President's position and I'm not sure I understand what it's meant to be but I do know the reason behind it and I understand why.
87,45,The joke about wearing a mask to walk 10 feet is a joke. It sounds like a joke and a joke but the concept of it seems to be a joke. I think it's a joke.
95,45,"I can tell that some of the pranks you're describing seem like sarcastic and very funny, so it's a shame that this is all a prank."
99,45,"The whole point of that article is to get people to read the article before going to see the movie. I like this movie because it's about the truth. I can't believe there are all the ""things that will make people feel good if they do anything to prevent the spread of the virus."" In the story, the government was actually responsible for getting it out of his body. There's a story about it."
45,1,Vaccination is a key component of preventing the spread of the virus.
45,10,"You should see the movie, I'm not a lawyer, but I was interviewed recently for the job interview for a news agency. I got the impression that it was a joke, but I am not sure if it's really a joke. I don't understand why people seem to think that a joke is a joke. It's just a joke, and it's a joke."
45,11,"Vaccinating is supposed to protect the people who live in these regions. It’s not even a joke at all. It’s a great way to prevent a virus from spreading, albeit a little bit more destructive. Vaccinating is supposed to prevent infection, which is why some people get a little bit of a bit of a headache from that."
45,21,It's pretty funny. People are gonna get mad at him when they see him do that prank.
45,22,"He's one of the presidents I think is the greatest president, he is one of the most successful presidents in history."
45,34,This was the joke of the first week of TWC!
45,40,"The movie is about him having a fun time, not playing with it. It is about how he is trying to prevent the spread of an epidemic and how he wants to get back into the hood."
45,43,"I don't think it's a joke. I think a joke about that was probably a way to evoke a reaction. If the joke is a joke, then you're probably not a very serious fan of a joke."
45,44,And all of those people are the ones saying that they're getting a sickening joke about it and thinking it's a joke?
51,45,"I think the ACA's a joke, but it isn't the actual ACA itself. It isn't the ACA itself, and it doesn't seem like they're trying to put the ACA in the right place at all."
62,45,I don't think anyone here is aware of this. I'm sorry but I am a dick. I think this situation is going to be a dick story.
76,45,There are so many things people don't understand.
87,45,I find it weird that it's so well known that the OP hasn't heard of it. I'm going to give it a try.
95,45,"''I'm a man and I enjoy all of the ideas you described."""
99,45,"I read a book called The Man Who Doesn't Sleep With Trump, and was interested in this movie. I loved it but I'm afraid I'm not on the same page as you. I'd like to see the movie in more detail."
45,1,I'm on a 'death slash'.
45,10,"I'm not sure why people are interpreting this as a joke, but when people say that 'we need to ban vaccinating the public as soon as possible. Vaccinating is part of a government policy. It's also an attempt at preventing the spread of a virus.'"
45,11,It's pretty funny. People are gonna get mad at him when they see him do that. It's pretty funny. I'm sorry but I am a dick.
45,21,"I think that's why it's a joke, not the actual ACA."
45,22,I'd be putting in an hour and a half to see the movie.
45,34,"I read the headlines to a different person and got a feeling that there is a joke in it. I couldn't understand the message. I was in a bad mood. I can't explain it, I just didn't read it in a way that made me laugh."
45,40,"Vaccination isn't a joke, if you get the story right you get the joke."
45,43,The movie is a satire and it's actually a comedy. I think it's hilarious that people haven't seen it.
45,44,You don't understand the joke. That's not a joke.
51,45,"I don't know about the ACA, but it's the newest strain of AIDS that is causing so many deaths for people with the disease that it's no wonder it's so contagious."
62,45,>I'm sorry but I am a dick. I think this situation is going to be a dick story. It's not a joke. It's a joke.
76,45,"OP, you are correct."
87,45,"I think the point of the joke is that when it is a joke, it sounds like a joke, but the concept of it seems to be a joke."
95,45,It's all sarcasm.
99,45,The book I read reads like a true story about a man who had an insane addiction to drugs.
45,1,"""I think he doesn't deserve a helmet. He does not deserve a helmet because it is a helmet."""
45,10,Vaccination is a part of the measures deployed by the US government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. I don't know how they made that joke and the fact that it is a joke does not make it a joke. Vaccinating the public as soon as possible. Vaccinating is part of a government policy. It's also an attempt at preventing the spread of a virus.
45,11,"I would never put up with people trying to sabotage their health. It would be funny to me, it was a joke."
45,21,Vaccinating is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
45,22,It's a joke whose purpose is to prevent the spread of AIDS. I don't think it's funny at all.

45,40,Vaccination is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I don't think anyone here is aware of this. I'm sorry but I am a dick. I think this situation is going to be a dick story. There are so many things people don't understand.
45,43,It's a joke. And it's not a joke.
45,44,Vaccination is an important part of tackling a disease.
51,45,"So if you aren't on a team, are you? That's just an excuse. You don't think your friend is comfortable with that. This is one of the most disgustingly funny things that's ever been said to me by an AMA."
62,45,"He was trying to use the term ""dick"" to describe himself as someone who is not a dick. It seems a bit of a stretch but I have to agree."
76,45,'The president doesn't have to wear a mask. He can't wear one because he hasn't gotten the time to properly fit it.'
87,45,"I'm in no way a doctor, but my doctor's opinion is that, if the person has a hard time breathing, it can cause them to feel uncomfortable, and for him to go about his job as a doctor, to be able to go about his job, he'd like to put on a mask for those who have problems. A doctor who says this is hilarious, and a doctor, in a nutshell, would not want to wear a mask to help them if they were in a nutshell, but would say, ""This is"
95,45,"> I'm just listening to the audiobooks and I didn't really know what I was doing. I thought it was a prank, but I had to stop watching because of what the movie was about. I thought it was funny - but not really, so I find it hilarious that it is a prank. I am not a prank guy, but I am not an asshole."
99,45,"...and if it does, I am not sure it can go anywhere else. ""(I'm a man of my word)"" (I'm not sure why the movie didn't get posted on reddit), ""[There are lots of people who are saying that the guy is an asshole for thinking that it's normal."
45,1,"I mean, the sarcasm in the video is actually the one in the movie, you'mean'"
45,10,"It's a joke, and a joke about it."
45,11,"Well, I'd have the same question but not as a guy with an AIDS diagnosis who is not in control of his body, if the government is responsible for his health they don't have the authority or ability to make it better or take control of the situation."
45,21,This is all just a joke. Vaccination is part of the measures deployed by the US government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
45,22,"A doctor, and I are going to have to agree that this is one of the most hilarious jokes that's ever been said to me by an AMA."
45,34,"People say, ""I don't know how to express this""... and this is just one of those jokes, and I just don't like it."
45,40,I just thought that I'd be the worst person in the world if I didn't wear a mask. That's not funny.
45,43,Vaccination is an important part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
45,44,"I wouldn't have said that, but I do want to point out that this is a joke: ""We have to protect people who have this disease so that they don't have to carry a mask and are able to play on their own."""
51,45,""" if you wear a mask in public, are you? That's just an excuse. You don't think your friend is comfortable with that."""
62,45,The mask isn't a joke. It's a law that prohibits it.
76,45,What a jerk!
87,45,"I don't know about the doctor but it's really interesting that the joke is going to have a good one. The only thing I like about the movie is that it has a lot of good stories, but he has no idea what he's talking about. He also has very deep knowledge of the subject."
95,45,"It's funny that you're being sarcastic, but you're not an asshole. I think you're being over-sensitive."
99,45,"I like Trump because I like this guy because I like this guy a lot but I hate his mask and he's always been an asshole. And I hate his mask because he has to wear it.

I really want them to take care of you"", 'I hate that one, but the other one is amazing."
45,1,Vaccination is a key component of preventing the spread of the virus.
45,10,It's a 'joke' of an attempt to fuck up the health care system. They need to ban it immediately - and in the long run.
45,11,The article is actually the one in the movie.
45,21,That's the most egregious thing I can think of. There's nothing worse than having to deal with the possibility of a terrible health crisis. It's not the best way to be a patient.

45,43,">I thought it was funny - but not really, so I find it hilarious that it is a joke."
45,44,"I think the point is: The president is not an asshole, and the CIA has no interest in taking this a step further. I think it's important to get the CDC to look into the issue. But we need to know more about what is happening here."
51,45,"It's the ACA and the ACA itself, so the pranks aren't funny."
62,45,What are some of the facts about this situation?
76,45,It's also the only person in the US who has actually shaved their head and a friend of mine had a mask on for his team.
87,45,"Having said that, I think the joke is kinda funny. I do love that it is about the shit guy in the movie, but if it's about an anti virus virus, I don't think it's funny to get to the point where I can't even get used to it at all."

45,1,There are more than a few pranks pointing to it. You don't get a sarcastic joke.
45,10,What's the best way for you to get the joke to work?

45,40,I don't know if there's any reason to be so reprehensible about the Obama administration's role in this.
45,43,What do you think the CDC does to prevent AIDS? The fact that they do this to prevent it is enough to convince people they need a mask.
45,44,Vaccination is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.Vaccination is about promoting better health.
51,45,A man who wore a mask and the word mask on his hands is the only way to save people from being infected. I would go and have my mask and take my mask off or I would get infected again. And then you know when he has to go and go get a mask? It will be a prank.

45,43,"I'm not saying the movie is a joke, I'm saying that the movie was a great example of a prank that the CDC should have rolled out. It would be much better if the author said something like:"

45,10,Is it really a prank?
45,11,The book is in the movie.
45,21,I don't think they're talking about the virus. I think it's a prank about the President wearing a mask and not what the President should be doing. Unless someone was trying to sabotage the president's health and then the person did what he was doing.
45,22,The fact that it's a joke doesn't mean it's not a joke. That's a prank.
45,34,Vaccination is a joke because it is a joke. The fact that the president has been wearing a mask for nearly two decades because of the health care system.
