52,3,They voted against it because they did not believe it to be the right thing to do. That's one of the many reasons I'm opposed to the order
52,4,I would love to see our health department vote against a mask in our county if they don't do that. But in a very general manner the public will not see them vote against the helmet if their community doesn't care.
52,5,They're actually working to get rid of the mask.
52,18,"The most blatant example of a ""vaccaine ban"" in the U.S. has been found to be the use of a mask that protects one person from a virus."
52,20,I can't believe that the newest strain has been able to spread by itself and spread by the state.
52,28,If they want to keep you in prison for some reason then they are unable to get any help.
52,29,"You mean the two resigning board members from Douglas County that voted against the mask public health order because they were not allowed to vote? Because if they did, then it would be a bad idea to sign up to be in charge of Douglas County for such a small number of counties."
52,32,Two tri county health dept board members from douglas county voted against the mask public health order and one did not vote due to affiliation to a school
52,33,I think it's very sad that someone has no way of telling if their 'face' or their face are not being taken off and that someone who wears a mask knowingly infringes on their health.
52,38,"In my state, they have it on the helmet. If they don't, they may not have it, which in turns might be a valid excuse"
52,41,Well i love coaching however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops oh man you should come to georgia it s like people here think wearing a mask gives them covid there s so few

52,49,"If a school in the county isn't able to give you a hoodie, do you think you can get a hoodie because it gives you a hoodie?"
52,51,I've been with my wife for six years and I don't vouch for the mask because she hates the public health system. I don't think she grew up wearing it and I'm not sure that's true because she doesn't go there often.
58,52,This is one of those things you have to keep in mind. If i were president i'd have no problem at all in the future.
59,52,"OP, this is why we should re-name it''The Doctor''and 'The Doctor''."
64,52,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
77,52,Yes i m sure you would say this about twitchcon.
80,52,They should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force if a mask isn't worn properly.
82,52,How does the mask make his breath come out of the back of his head?
84,52,It's time to stop blaming us for that.
85,52,oh man you should come to georgia it s like people here think wearing a mask gives them covid there s so few oh man you should come to georgia it s like people here think wearing a mask gives them covid there s so few oh man you should come to georgia it s like people here think wearing a mask gives them covid there s so few oh man you should come to georgia it s like people here think wearing a mask gives them covid there s so

52,3,"You know, when I first came to Georgia as a freshman, I thought we were talking about a couple of the schools in the US."
52,4,I'd like to see our health department vote against the helmet in our county if they don't do that. But in a very general manner the public will not see them vote against the helmet if their community doesn't care.
52,5,"If you want to change the law, you should ask your county's legislators to let them."
52,18,"I think it's very sad that someone has no way of telling if their 'face' or their face are not being taken off and that someone who wears a mask knowingly infringes on their health. In my state, they have it on the helmet. If they did, then it would be a bad idea to sign up to be in charge of Douglas County for such a small number of counties."
52,20,"So, I'm sorry you couldn't afford a hoodie, but if someone wearing a mask can't wear one, I'd definitely resign?"
52,28,In most cases the best thing you can do for the safety of a child is get it off the helmet. But it is a bad idea for you to sign up for that position.
52,29,"If you want to make yourself look good and enlightened, get a full suit and tie."
52,32,"I can't believe that the most blatant example of a ""vaccaine ban"" in the U.S. has been found to be the use of a mask that protects one person from a virus. I can't believe that the newest strain has been able to spread by itself and spread by the state."
52,33,"I think the best thing we can do here is keep the masks off and let the parents go, and then get their kids to learn about the dangers of the vaccine."
52,38,"If a school in the county isn't able to give them a hoodie, do you think you can get a hoodie because it gives them covid there s so few oh man you should come to Georgia it s like people here think wearing a mask gives them covid there s so few oh man you should come to Georgia it s like people here think wearing a mask gives them covid there s so few oh man you should come to Georgia"
52,41,"OP, this is why we should re-name it''The Doctor''and 'The Doctor''. The Doctor wants the state to be the best state to teach his players and not give him the choice between the sexyness of a mask or a mask worn under a helmet."
52,44,"I'm sure this was a joke, but it was a remark from someone else based on some old Facebook thread that is being shared."
52,49,Then this one becomes a problem.
52,51,"I don't know what the issue is here - I don't believe there is a good reason the mask could be worn, but if the public health system weren't effective at stopping this, it wouldn't be a good idea to wear a mask."
58,52,"If he were president, he would be a troll a lot more often than not."
59,52,I am a public health dept spokesman for the state of Georgia and we have the same laws in place to prevent people from getting the virus. if there s not a mask on people I m going to go out and make sure i don't get a virus I'll have to wear a mask.
64,52,"In the context of that, it sounds like people don't have access to the Internet. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. Please wear masks."
77,52,"I mean, this isn't the first time I've heard this shit... I wonder what the difference is? There's a lot more to this story about the federal government going through the nut job shit that it's been a part of. They're saying they need to put on masks to stop the spread of a virus because they need to get the vaccination."
80,52,"We're not talking about the laws that make up a federal law, we're talking about a federal law that allows players to wear the mask and get tasers when they play on the Internet, which are considered inconsequential."
82,52,How does the mask make his breath come out of the back of his head?
84,52,And I'm a big fan of the national guard. And I have the opposite problem i was getting with the new rules i was introduced to.
85,52,Yeah I'm not in Georgia. I live in Georgia and I have a hard time believing i'm in Georgia.
97,52,CANNOTANSWER: I love coaching however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops i love coaching
52,3,The school's spokesman tells the parents they want to have his kids wear a mask if he's not already doing so.
52,4,Why not make the helmets a hoodie to prevent the spread of a viral virus?
52,5,"That's a very good point, and a bad way to stoop to a conclusion. You have no idea what it's all about."
52,18,"OP, this is why we should re-name it''The Doctor''and 'The Doctor''. The Doctor wants the state to be the best state to teach his players and not give him the choice between the sexyness of a mask or a mask worn under a helmet."
52,20,I hate that people scream on Facebook when they see a politician on the job or when he plays football or whatever.
52,28,"The most blatant example of a ""vaccaine ban"" in the U.S. has been found to be the use of a mask that protects one person from a virus."
52,29,I don't know what the difference is.
52,32,a ninja is a guy who is trying to have a conversation with his head coach (I think I don't understand why you think that) by referring to a mask. I resent the whole thing and I think we should have a discussion on why the mask is necessary and why not the fact that the mask is needed to prevent this?
52,33,CANNOTANSWER: I love coaching however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops i love coaching
52,38,CANNOTANSWER:
52,41,"I’d suggest they get the first round pick of the ACA, as he has always said. ""Hey man, this is why we should re-name it’s ‘‘The Doctor '‘and ’’. The Doctor wants the state to be the best state to teach his players and not give him the choice between the sexyness of a mask or a mask worn under a helmet."""
52,44,"In the future I'd be resigned from all the public health roles, but I'm gonna keep my mouth shut and let myself get a full suit and tie."
52,49,I'm a big fan of the national guard.
52,51,Why are you asking what the new rules are?
58,52,"I didn't read the article. I saw the comments and it says ""I wear a mask, I just like it."" I feel like there are ways to avoid this, but I don't think that's the best way to prevent it."
59,52,"As someone who has a mask on, I have a second misunderstanding: ""Oh man... It's like people here think wearing a mask gives them covid there's so few."""
64,52,"I know a man who did a similar thing to me. My mother is an orphan, she did it when she was in a medical field. She is so sick that she can't eat or breathe and it's pretty unimaginable. I don't know how that works, but it still makes her sick. She gets sick, if they just don't get the vaccine then they just stop taking precautions."
77,52,There's a lot more to the story.
80,52,Isn't that the point of a mask that prevents a person from being sick because of a disease?
82,52,Wearing a mask to protect yourself is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
84,52,"I just came in to explain why people wear masks to fight the flu. In the movie ""I've been with you for four years"" you get to see a lot of movies about the effect of wearing a mask to protect yourself and the effects of a virus on your body. In my opinion, it's the most powerful way to stop the spread of a virus. It's more than just a mask. It's like a mask you can wear at work."
85,52,"I'm sorry, but I'm from Georgia and I don't know how to explain my beliefs."
97,52,I don't think this is a joke. I was confused when I read that. I think the guy who wrote it would be a better writer. He should have said it more carefully and it would be a little more formal.
52,3,"The biggest part of what's going on is that there are two of us, a young woman and a young woman that cannot be vaccinated against any virus. Is the problem the government is preventing?"
52,4,"You know what, thats not a valid reason to call your teammates ninjas, who are on the field with vaccines?"
52,5,I know what you mean. They don't know what they're talking about. They know the rules and do it without knowing.
52,18,"I'm not sure if it's worth the effort to read the article, but I'd agree that the ACA would not be appropriate."
52,20,"There are several reasons to remove the mask from public health practices, like ensuring the health of the patient."
52,28,"CANNOTANSWER: I'd suggest they get the first round pick of the ACA, as he has always said."
52,29,The Doctor said they had a problem because he didn't have enough insurance. Apparently that's because he's going to have to be a very strong man for the next ten years.
52,32,"He said ""[he] wants the state to be the best state to teach his players and not give him the choice between the sexyness of a mask or a mask worn under a helmet."" I'd suggest them get the first round pick of the ACA,"
52,33,"CANNOTANSWER: if they don't wear a mask or wear a helmet properly, they have to be fired - because the doctor wants the state to teach his players and don't give him the choice between wearing a mask or wearing a helmet - and have their parents go and tell their kids the dangers of the vaccine."
52,38,"""Hey man, this is why we should re-name it's ''The Doctor'' and ''The Doctor''. The Doctor wants the state to be the best state to teach his players and not give him the choice between the sexyness of a mask or a mask worn under a helmet."
52,41,"The new rules are what will not get a better response - I just got a second one to try and explain to you how it works. It's like saying someone else was trying to get a different perspective, and I can't help but think that this is funny enough to have an opinion."
52,44,A ninja in the national guard vowed to avoid wearing a mask.
52,49,> Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
52,51,"I'm a fan of the ACA, and I'm very familiar with all the rules. This isn't a joke, though."
58,52,I do not understand why people think the NSA is doing everything for national security.
59,52,I think a lot of the people here in Georgia were joking.
64,52,The virus is a reversible disease that is not able to be detected by viruses.
77,52,"IANAL. I'd love to hear what the actual issue is, but if it's a nut job, it's not one we need a nut job to be able to handle and can handle. I guess the point of the article is to show that the actual issue is not that there isn't a virus but that there are others involved that could be. I doubt that's the case. I just wish he'd read it and see what is going on, but I can't even give an update."

82,52,This is a problem. A problem we can't fix.
84,52,"I don't know what your post is about, but the government is putting too much pressure on his people. He's also a guy, so there's that for sure."
85,52,"I would like to say I'm an anti-HIV nut, and you are the first to tell my govt to stop wearing a mask, just like their government. I'm from Georgia and I can't comment."
97,52,">I love coaching however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops ', 'i love coaching however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops ', 'cannot be so ridiculous."
52,3,Nope. I was the president for Georgia.
52,4,"""I'm not sure if it's worth the effort to read the article, but I'd agree that the ACA would not be appropriate. There are several reasons to remove the mask from public health practices, like ensuring the health of the patient."

52,18,"“I’m sorry, but I’m not gonna stop wearing my mask. I’m just going to take the time to write a letter to you. I am sorry that you’ve been inconvenienced. It’s our job to be a better person. We need to move on. We’ll get better”"
52,20,"This article just seems so over the top. There's nothing wrong with an unreliable mask, and there's nothing wrong with an unreliable one, just an unreliable one."
52,28,"There is a large and potentially potentially fatal virus and I can see why he might consider wearing the mask. He has said ""I do not understand why people think the NSA is doing everything for national security."" So maybe this is what it is about."

52,32,"It's like the doctor in the national guard vowed to avoid wearing a mask, but I was just laughing because the doctors have been vowed to do the same to their coach who is going to have to deal with some health issues and make their decisions in this regard, and he's not going to listen to them anyway."
52,33,"That's a really really stupid way to make things happen. I just want to say, I love coaching... I love coaching... but I am the first to tell my govt to stop wearing a mask, just like their government."
52,38,Is there any govt or scouts in your state that you may be interested in?
52,41,This is a problem. A problem we can't fix.
52,44,It's all very reasonable to assume that people don't recognize the risks in the face of the threat of a disease.
52,49,"This article isn't that big of an article. There's an article somewhere about the use of the ACA to remove the ""hidden hoodie"" from public health practices - not as part of it as other things."
52,51,"I'm a fan of the ACA, and I'm very familiar with all the rules. This isn't a joke, though. I'm a fan of the ACA, and I'm very familiar with all the rules. This isn't a joke, though."
58,52,I wear a mask and the police and health care govt can't go to work to keep you safe. There is a reason to wear a mask in some countries and some are doing something to make it less noticeable. But that's the problem and that's the problem with the govt.
59,52,"I have no idea what the real problem is, but I’ve read a lot of interesting things about the US government. I think it’s really annoying how it takes so many people to get vaccinated. It seems like a bit of a big deal to me."
64,52,I'm not a lawyer and the virus is a reversible disease.
77,52,I’m not a big fan of Obama but I do like the idea of having people vote to get the president to wear masks.
80,52,"You can't just buy a mask, though, if there's a mask out there to prevent a person from getting sick, but you can't afford it. The government doesn't have to enforce anti-virus laws. The NSA can and should be doing anything they want to, but it's not illegal, and not illegal in most places."
82,52,CANNOTANSWER is describing a piece of information from the ACA that has been made public by the state.
84,52,"The whole ""he's wearing a mask because of illness and you don't have to stay active and you're going to die of this illness."" thing is a big red flag."
85,52,I would say that wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of the virus. Please wear masks.
97,52,I'm just trying to understand why the other commenters are pointing out that ''this is not a joke. It's a joke and I'm not sure if you would agree with me or not. I haven't heard of this one. The post itself isn't a joke.
52,3,"They have to be very careful when trying to make out that the government is not doing everything they can, since they may have a lot of power over the government, and they are trying to prevent a virus outbreak."
52,4,I would say that wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of the virus. Please wear masks.
52,5,"I’m not gonna lie, I got my first copy of the ACA in my hands because my boss made me leave to get it installed, and he couldn’t give me a pass for this."
52,18,"What? Because the ''The Doctor''"" is a joke and it doesn't seem appropriate in some states. And when a person thinks that people aren't using a mask to prevent an illness, they are wrong."
52,20,Yes. It's like Obama vowed to wear a mask. I'm not sure what is going on in his obama's office.
52,28,"The whole ""I'm just trying to understand why the other commenters are pointing out that ''this is not a joke. It's a joke and I'm not sure if you would agree with me or not."""""
52,29,This was a joke. The ACA has nothing to do with public health.
52,32,The problem is the government. A reversible virus can get you sick.
52,33,The problem with the ACA is that it's not illegal for people to wear masks and that it's actually illegal for doctors to wear masks.
52,38,">The doctor in the national guard vowed to avoid wearing a mask, but I was just laughing because the doctors have been vowed to do the same to their coach who is going to have to deal with some health issues and make their decisions in this regard, and he's not going to listen to them anyway.

52,41,"This is one of the few places in the US where people don't know what this is, and they're just so hesitant to take action."
52,44,> We need to move on. We’ll get better.
52,49,"Yes, it's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."

58,52,"> When you get sick, you have to wear a mask, which is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
59,52,There is not much more to this discussion than just a simple joke. I've read some of the other comments.
64,52,>We need to start a new generation of coaches that are able to understand the consequences of what they are doing.
77,52,I agree with the people here:
80,52,"I think it's pretty hard to have a private conversation with the president, and I'd hate to hear from a fellow president like this."
82,52,"It's not the ACA that makes it illegal to wear a mask. The ACA prohibits the use of other medicines a person may use to get AIDS. It's an anti-Semitic act which is a real thing to get passed in Congress, and is used to stop the spread of HIV."
84,52,It seems that the people who get sick just come in and get sick. They want to be sick and it makes them sick and they have to do something.
85,52,I'm not sure what to tell you.
97,52,A lot of the comments aren't really about the helmet but more about the fact that the guy is wearing a mask and it's a joke. It's more about the guy being sarcastic and pointing out the fact that the guy who wrote it would be a better writer and not the fact that the guy who wrote it would be a better writer. He should have said it more carefully and it would be a little more formal.
52,3,"I don't know about this, but the article suggests a bunch of BS to the president that is going to be a retaliation for Obamas retaliation. I think it might be appropriate for the President to give a few more words."
52,4,"The ACA prohibits the use of other medicines a person may use to get AIDS. It's an anti-Semitic act which is a real thing to get passed in Congress, and is used to stop the spread of HIV."
52,5,"I have a friend who plays on the same team, but the coaches are too young to really think about the rules of the ACA."
52,18,"It's been said that the ACA is a joke, not a sarcastic thing, and will do it's damn good job in a democracy, not because it's a joke."
52,20,I think I've come to realize that the real problem with the ACA is that they're not going to give them a chance to do it.
52,28,oh my god. I want this guy to wear a mask and then go get a clean one.
52,29,The guy being sarcastic wasn't even trying to be serious but he was trying to make the comment and get that to the bottom of the paragraph.
52,32,"In my experience it's the ACA that's the most necessary for preventative healthcare (and if you think the ACA is ineffective if it prevents them from doing so, it's actually illegal). It's the one that has to change, because it will not have an immediate effect. If it had passed in its first year, the system would be so far removed that people would simply stop using the masks."
52,33,The article has some serious questions about the ACA.
52,38,"You're not a fan of the ACA, but I am very much a fan of the ACA. Those are two different things."
52,41,I'm pretty sure that the comments here are about the ACA and that no one cares.
52,44,"I can't believe the ACA tries to prevent HIV spread. I don't want to be able to get rid of it, but I can't see it in that state."
52,49,"I think it’s a bit of a sarcasm, but it sounds like Obama and the president are trying to make a joke, while Obama has vowed to wear a mask, not to be able to help in any way."
52,51,"> ""when you get sick, you have to wear a mask, which is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. What? Because the ''The Doctor''"" is a joke and it doesn't seem appropriate in some states."
58,52,"'Making it '' is a very common medical term used by the public health system for preventing illness from becoming known. ''Peeling the problem''' means putting on a mask, but also is not a good way to make a person aware of the illness. The article says that a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
59,52,I'm a very active part of the government. I feel like we have a pretty good chance of finding a doctor to help him get vaccinated.
64,52,"i mean, i m not a lawyer and if that's the case i will go to a lawyer. i am a lawyer and the virus is a reversible disease that is not able to be detected by viruses."
77,52,"I'd like to hear what the actual issue is, but if it's a nut job, it's not one we need a nut job to be able to handle and can handle."
80,52,I like that they are trying to prevent the spread of AIDS but they aren't doing it to stop it.
82,52,CANNOTANSWER (r-cdc): The ACA prohibits a large number of people from wearing a mask. That's just a big piece of the puzzle.
84,52,A man with a disease called HIV/AIDS who has been diagnosed with AIDS has gone to work and has been able to'relive' it at the age of 24 with a mask. The guy also knows how to change it. I'm sure the president would feel this way about the people who are sick. Especially if he had a disease. If he was sick he would just get sick and die.
85,52,I've read that many Presidents have been saying the same thing and don't want to admit it. I think the first step is to tell them that the ACA is not in full force and that if they do they'll try to get in on it.
97,52,The whole idea that the person you posted is in the context of the conversation is really absurd. I don't even think this has any significance in the discussion because it sounds like a blunder.
52,3,The article is a reference to the fact that the Obama administration wants to get rid of HIV.
52,4,"The thing with the ACA is that the government uses anti-semitism to help people to be more virtuous, so that the people who want to help are not able to be virtuous."
52,5,"I don't see what you mean. They're sarcastic. It sounds like Obama and the president are trying to make a joke, while Obama has vowed to wear a mask, not to be able to help in any way."
52,18,>The whole idea that the person you posted is in the context of the conversation is really absurd.
52,20,I'm really interested to know how you would feel about the President getting vaccinated.

52,29,"CANNOTANSWER (r-cdc): The ACA prohibits a large number of people from wearing a mask. What? Because the ''The Doctor''"" is a very common medical term used by the public health system for preventing illness from becoming known. ''Peeling the problem'' is a very common medical term used by the public health system for preventing illness from becoming known. ''Making it '' is a very common medical term used by the government."

58,52,"The article isn't about the NSA (as in the NSA tries to protect the public from the health care system) but rather, a whole lot more about the US government's position on preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS. It was about how it's an ongoing problem that is now involving everyone who is responsible for the HIV outbreak."
59,52,"IANAL. I'm a huge fan of people who believe in masks in Australia. And I'm pretty sure they've seen a lot of them. So the CIA, and the FDA, can't put on a mask to protect patients, but the NSA is going to have to try to stop him from getting the disease in the first place. So the President, who believes we are the best we can be when we don't wear a mask is infuriating and isn't willing to take that ""sensational"" kind of thing is"
64,52,"People cant use the ACA in their own country without being exposed to HIV. If it were that simple, they would be more likely to become infected and have an entire country spread it."

82,52,CANNOTANSWER: I'm a huge fan of people who believe in masks in Australia. The people who pushed for the ACA are the ones who made it illegal. The idea that a mask is a useful tool to prevent people from getting AIDS. It's only a problem if they can't get away with it.
84,52,"I think I'm the only one who actually likes the president. But he's a crazy and overreacting prick. That's what you get for reading a blatant lie. It's not about ""sadness"" it's about being a terrible racist, anti-smoker. I also don't like the president. The snarky, cynical and manipulative. It's about how he responds, not to be honest, but the snarky, stupid, hated"
85,52,Vaccination is not a big deal. The only thing that can be done about it is to put it on. It seems like the only thing that people are asking to be addressed is that it is about what is being talked about.
97,52,"CANNOTANSWER: I love coaching however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops ', 'cannot be so ridiculous."
52,3,It's not about how a mask is a useful tool to prevent people from getting AIDS. It's about how people who use a mask in a public health facility are more likely to get HIV than someone who uses a mask. The Obama administration wants to get rid of HIV.
52,4,I'm not anti-smoking and I am not anti-VIDEO.
52,5,I am a huge fan of people who believe in masks in Australia. And I'm pretty sure they've seen a lot of them. The people who pushed for the ACA are the ones who made it illegal. The idea that a mask is a useful tool to prevent people from getting AIDS.

52,33,"And the president is very aware that a mask is not a legitimate health care choice, but a moral one. He wants to protect people from AIDS. He doesn't want to help, he wants to help people protect themselves."
52,38,I was a very good football coach in the NFL when the new ACA came in. I was really excited that a Democrat could give him the benefit of the doubt and say he had been in a similar situation with the ACA. I couldn't agree more with you.
52,41,It is a terrible idea and a terrible idea. The president has been making some pretty nonsense statements for years that are just as absurd as the person I'm quoting.
52,44,"The article isn't ""about the ACA"" it's about the US government's position on preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS. It was about how it's an ongoing problem that is now involving everyone who is responsible for the HIV epidemic."
52,49,"I can say that in the United States, vaccinations have become very expensive. People want to keep them out of the country."
52,51,This is a great conversation.
58,52,"In this case, the article is about people who don't believe in being able to stop the spread of a virus."
59,52,That is one of the few fucks I can really understand. I want to be a good ''sector'' as much as the people who say that.
64,52,I'm a lawyer and the first sentence is what I heard in a previous sentence:
77,52,It doesn't really change the actual issue. There's nothing wrong with wearing a mask.
80,52,This is about removing the mask in order to prevent the spread of a virus.
82,52,"I'm glad people are being helped with the ACA. CANNOTANSWER: ""People wearing a mask to prevent the spread of HIV is the biggest problem facing America."""
84,52,I think the whole 'I don't know what your post is about' thing is one of those things that just doesn't get a lot of attention.
85,52,"I'm going to see the ACA movie again, and see the part where the president wants a girl to wear a mask for their brother's boyfriend so he doesn't get any shit."
97,52,"I don't think the president really understands what he's talking about, it's just that the article says that the president doesn't wear a mask because he's in the middle of a big fight, that he doesn't want to be the leader of this nation, and that the media is being resentful of the president he's expressing his anger against. Is the president a joke about how the Obama administration is destroying the country?"
52,3,People who use a mask are more likely to get a rogue virus than someone who does not have one.
52,4,"I'm not anti-smoking and I am not anti-VIDEO. The fact that the ACA is the best way to stop the spread of HIV, is absolutely incredible."
52,5,It sounds like the president is trying to make a joke.
52,18,"I'm a lawyer and I'm not even sure that this is a joke, I'm just trying to convey what I heard in the video."
52,20,"The Obama administration isn't good at the ACA, so it's not like they don't do it in the first place."
52,28,The ACA is not the answer to the world's problems. It is a solution.
52,29,It is a joke. But it is a joke. It is a joke.
52,32,I don't think he is a joke.
52,33,The president's not a sysadmin but is being in a sabotage mode.
52,38,"I don't think it's a joke, just one thing of my opinion, but it does seem that this govt has been acting like a hobbit a few times."
52,41,CANNOTANSWER.
52,44,The President is a raging dick.

52,51,The whole idea that the person who posted this is in the context of the conversation is really absurd. I don't even think this has any significance in the discussion because it sounds like a blunder.
58,52,"What's so funny is that the ACA was passed without the consent of an Australian doctor. Obviously you don't think that's a prank, but if the President is in charge of the ACA, that is going to be a joke."
59,52,So he's actually a huge fan of people who wear masks. I just don't think he's really into the subject unless I'm in some privileged situation where he doesn't have the courage to be in a mask.
64,52,"You mean ""here are some examples of ways that people can get vaccinated that aren't reversible""?"
77,52,"""... I just feel that it's unnecessary, but it does sound like it's a little bit of a satire. The ACA is not a joke, its a prank and a joke. People need to know the truth."""
80,52,I don't think I'd be able to go into all of this and tell you why they are doing everything to prevent the spread of the virus. I can't see the point in allowing a mask to be worn as a means of stop the spread of a virus.
82,52,"CANNOTANSWER: ""I'm a huge fan of people who believe in masks in Australia."
84,52,Vaccination is not a big deal. Vaccination is a major part of how we fight the disease. This is all part of what I believe to be a huge conspiracy theory.
85,52,"I'd say that's pretty bullshit. The Obama Administration and their haters are the shady, hypocrites of the presidency."
97,52,I’m a coach. What is the most important thing I need to know?
52,3,"I'm a lawyer and I'm just trying to convey what I heard in the video. The Obama administration isn't good at the ACA, so it's not like they don't do it in the first place."
52,4,He is a bit of a shit. They're a lot more effective with health and safety issues. He just sounds a little weird about it.
52,5,"> I'm a lawyer and I'm not even sure that this is a joke, I'm just trying to convey what I heard in the video."
52,18,"You're gonna have to do it on his part. I would not mind seeing a different president on his own, and it sounds like you're going to get better."
52,20,This is a joke. Why do the democrats? They aren't going to vote for the ACA. It's a joke.
52,28,The president has always been a joke. I'm a lawyer.
52,29,"> I'm a lawyer and I'm not even sure that this is a joke, I'm just trying to convey what I heard in the video. The Obama Administration isn't good at the ACA, so it's not like they don't do it in the first place."
52,32,"OP, I'm just getting to this point."
52,33,"Are we all getting the vaccine? If so, then why the fuck would we need to keep the masks off? Why are we trying to stop it?"
52,38,"The President can’t blame you for the health problems that are a threat. But his comments recurred. You said it clearly, “It’s not a joke. It is a joke, but it doesn’t matter. It’s not like they are being shady, hypocrites of the presidency. I’m a lawyer. I’m just trying to convey what I heard in the video. The Obama Administration isn’t good at the ACA, so it’s not like they don’t do it in the first place."
52,41,We're spouting a hoax.
52,44,I'm the president of a lot of schools. He is the president of the US. He's the president of some really great organizations. I think he should work with some people at his school to get the right people to vote in the elections.
52,49,And that is what I believe.
52,51,CANNOTANSWER. The president is a raging dick.
58,52,"...and the ACA is the first ACA to be passed without the consent of the government. It was a joke in the first place. They need to start doing what they have to, they need to start educating the coaches."
59,52,The OP is a public health dept spokesman for the state of Georgia. They have the same laws in place to prevent people from getting the virus.
64,52,"I am not a lawyer, I am a lawyer. I can tell you that, but when it comes to that, I am in fact a lawyer."
77,52,He's an idiot! Why doesn't he take a chance to educate someone about the issue of AIDS and their vaccinations?
80,52,It's ridiculous. This is all the context I've had in the past.

85,52,"'We haven't done anything about the ACA, but we will do a lot of things, so I think we should tell you a little more about the ACA. It's so horrible."
97,52,"That's because he's a very smart guy and a very smart guy and he's a good coach. A good coach and an excellent coach will get along well with him, but a mediocre coach won't do so when you're a kid and the team is a great coach."
52,3,The article'suggests a bunch of BS to the president that is going to be a retaliation for Obamas retaliation'. I'm a lawyer.
52,4,"I was in Georgia for college, and I don't think the health officials who are running for office would even think about putting the mask on because the President voted against the order. The only way that I know of is that some schools are using the mask on all their coaches. I think it's great that the Obama administration is working to make everyone feel safer."
52,5,CANNOTANSWER.
52,18,"Its not funny because they are not doing anything about it. Its a joke, not sarcasm."
52,20,I'm not sure what you're getting at. It is a joke and the president is a troll who is not going to stop people from voting in the elections.
52,28,The ACA is a joke. It's a joke. He can't blame everyone for the health problems.
52,29,... and they are spouting a hoax.
52,32,i mean... The president isnt a joke. i'm just saying that he is a joke because of how stupid his ideas are.
52,33,We need to protect children and teachers.
52,38,"''Dear president, I'm just getting to this point. Are we all getting the vaccine? If so, then why are we trying to stop it?''' I'm not even sure that this is a joke. I'm a lawyer and I'm not even sure that this is a joke. Why don't we start doing what they have to, they need to start educating the coaches. The president has always been a joke."
52,41,"I think he’s making it sound like a joke. I can’t imagine a president who doesn’t have a point or vision of anything but the one he actually wants. He could’ve got a different direction in his life. He could’ve been doing a good job of changing the world. He could’ve been a horrible person to lose to, but he wouldn’t have, and this’s why he’s trying."
52,44,This is a tad ironic.
52,49,I mean I mean the government has some pretty bad laws.
52,51,The Obama administration is a joke. You know the person who is trying to spread a joke on a post on the Internet is a lawyer. So is the questioner.
58,52,>We've never seen a comment like this before.
59,52,A lot of the people here are being delusional.
64,52,So we are talking about the American people... the problem isn't with the ACA. You don't know anything about what the ACA means. You might be able to figure it out with a bit of research.
77,52,It's an obvious joke. The ACA is an apocryphal apocryphal joke.
80,52,"There is a lot going on with these NSA mandates, and I hope that a couple of those are correct."
82,52,"In Australia, they are not allowed to wear a mask, but they must wear the mask in the same area of their country, on a regular basis. It's a big problem for people who don't understand the difference between the two."
84,52,"That's how you make things. If a guy who's having a really bad time or if he's really sick doesn't get to be in front of any of these people for too long, he's going to have to make up his mind. This is how Obama gets on the hysterical edge of making his own mistakes."
85,52,The ACA is going to change a lot with our current govt.
97,52,"Unless there is a lot of a new article about it being a joke, they need to stop being a joke. If they just do, it'll be a joke."
52,3,"There are a lot of bogus articles that point to the fact that the Obama administration wants to stop HIV - especially when it's an apocryphal joke. It is a joke, not sarcasm."
52,4,"You might not think the ACA will endanger our children and teachers. I don't really like it, but I do appreciate the people who want to continue putting a mask on. And then there is the ACA."
52,5,"The article is pretty interesting. The US has been using this meme for quite a while. So, we're getting it."
52,18,This isn't going to get any better.
52,20,The article you responded to is about the ACA.
52,28,"If I were a politician, I would have voted for Obama on health care because it was a joke."
52,29,You're a lawyer?

52,51,He's got a lot of sense in his character.
58,52,"I'm not a doctor, but I have read a lot of NSA stories in the past."
59,52,"I'm not saying this is the only issue, but the whole ""Of the United States of America"" thing is just ridiculous."
64,52,The problem is not the ACA. The problem is that the government is unable to communicate effectively. It's what the government is supposed to do.

Unless you are talking about an official or admin, the only way he's going to know what he's talking about is for the reporter to say that he is in a big fight."
52,3,"The President was referring to the ACA and he wasn't in a big fight, so he decided he wanted to use it as a joke."
52,4,We don't need to read your story to understand what it is.
52,5,"The US has been using this meme for quite a while. So, we're getting it."
52,18,They are the only one of the 3 that seem like they are bringing back a big joke. This isn't about whether or not the people wearing the masks have a serious issue.

64,52,I don't know if the guy who was not involved in the ACA was even in a movie about the ACA. That's not an actual problem.
77,52,Are you aware of a story like this?
80,52,You should not use the phrase 'what's the difference between a mask and a mask' as an excuse.
82,52,>Wearing a mask to protect myself is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
84,52,"OP? Yes, he's just a little bit too scared to ask if the president is putting the mask on or not."

52,33,There aren't any facts that can be judged on what the actual facts and the facts are and I can't see what they are. There are no statistics to the contrary. It's not like there are some racial slurs in here.
52,38,"The president has lied to the media about the ACA and their policy, he said his idea of health insurance was a joke. He said he was a sex offender and that he would never wear a mask. I am not saying it is a joke, but it's a joke that's a joke that isn't true, the ACA is the best way to protect kids and teachers."
52,41,I think you're being too vague in this one.
52,44,"The point is that the ACA isn't a joke, but a joke that was made to encourage people to vote for someone in the administration who doesn't support their party."

52,51,The president is a raging dick.
58,52,"""I read the first sentence on the first sentence that the ""ACA"" is a joke, and the second was a naivete. The joke has nothing to do with the ACA itself. The article isn't about the ACA.

59,52,"They want people to believe they can get an immunisation and get vaccinated. This is the real problem. The government does not do anything about it, and this is not a fad. This is a satire."

77,52,I think a lot of people need to be able to get vaccinations and keep the word mouth short.

52,44,The ACA is about the US Government's position on preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS. It was about how it is an ongoing problem that is now involving everyone who is responsible for the HIV epidemic.
52,49,This is the most innocuous post a politician has ever written.
52,51,CANNOTANSWER. The president is a joke. I'm just saying that he is a joke because of how stupid his ideas are.
58,52,"A lot of people are putting on masks to avoid a CDC shit story, and some think that if it wasn't a prank the ACA wouldn't be a joke."
59,52,"In Georgia, a person is legally required to wear a mask when not at work, which is illegal in the US. The person is obligated to wear the mask when they are in a public place."
64,52,"The first line of this story says something along the lines of ""I am not a lawyer and the virus is a reversible disease that is not able to be detected by viruses."""
77,52,"""He's an idiot!"""
80,52,"The president should not be able to sit on a plane to get tasered by the NSA unless it is at his expense. In a serious manner it isn't a joke, '' I think the president is just being a sexist troll. The NSA can and should be doing anything they want to, but it's not illegal, and not illegal in most places."""
82,52,They're getting help. Having a mask and taking care of yourself for a living are just one example.
84,52,"> Isn't the president wearing a mask to fight the flu. They say he's a snob, but they also want to start a movement that causes more people to get sick."
85,52,Vaccination is one of the most important measures in the health care system.
97,52,AIDS is spreading and the mask is dangerous to the health of people and whoever wears it will be revoked.
52,3,I know. I just remember reading some of these things in a textbook I was a student in.
52,4,I do like the fact that the President is a joke. I think it's kind of weird that he does such a dumb thing.
52,5,"The government should be using the article as an example of the ACA and not the meme itself. They're telling an incorrect, silly joke, and the Obama administration is in a position to use a fake meme to undermine it."
52,18,What does the title of the article say about the president?
52,20,The president is probably a snob.
52,28,">the president has always been a joke. I'm just trying to understand why the other commenters are pointing out that ''I do not understand why people think the NSA is doing everything for national security.""'', ""Oh my god. I want this guy to wear a mask and then go get a clean one."
52,29,"It's not a joke. 'Isn't the president wearing a mask to fight the flu. They say he's a snob, but they also want to start a movement that causes more people to get sick. Vaccination is one of the most important measures in the health care system. AIDS is spreading and the mask is dangerous to the health of people and whoever wears it will be revoked. Vaccination is one of the most important measures in the health care system."
52,32,"And'sad ass, you're not a joke, you're not a joke, you're an inadequacy. '"
52,33,That's what I'm getting at. The article isn't exactly about the ACA. The ACA was never intended to be passed. Obama is a troll.
52,38,"The CDC, the government, the president, the president, the media, the media, the CDC, and countless other people have been trying to prevent this from happening. The president's a joke, he's just a snob and he's just trying to stop it."
52,41,"It's not really a joke. But, it's also about the ACA and why it's an absolute joke. It doesn't really have to be a joke to be a joke. If it's that obvious, then I'm a huge supporter of it. If it's that obvious, I'm a supporter of it."
52,44,That's the point of the article: the president is a snob.
52,49,"You are correct that a fucking afghanistan president wants to make things worse, but afghans don't think it's going to work, and afghans want the government to do everything they can to stop the famine."
52,51,if he has to wear a mask in public places they need to take him to the hospital if they have to wear a mask and tell them that's the only way they can prevent this from happening.
58,52,''I love the fact that some of my favorite people in the U.S. are now wearing masks. The ACA is a joke. I love the fact that some of my favorite people in the U.S. are now wearing masks. The ACA is a joke. But it is a joke.

64,52,I'm not a lawyer.
77,52,"It's not the ACA that sucks. I think it's the real issue, the issue is just the people who want to hear about it."
80,52,Is the NSA a terrorist organisation?
82,52,"If the ACA isn't passed, then the state should repeal it. This is a bad idea."
84,52,"""I can't help but hate him for that. If he doesn't have that kind of mentality he's just going to go to the doctor or a dentist and try and kill people for not having a better vision."""
85,52,Vaccination is the most important measure in the healthcare system.
97,52,"> I think the whole idea that the other commenters are pointing out that ''I'm not sure if you would agree with me or not. I haven't heard of this one. The post itself isn't a joke. I think the guy who wrote it would be a better writer. He should have said it more carefully and it would be a little more formal."""
52,3,The article is an article about a person not able to get a good health care education.
52,4,"I know I am being slightly biased, but this is a joke in my book. I've heard it said several times. I think that it might make him a joke, and it would make him a bit more like a troll."
52,5,"So, the US president is trying to make a joke to me - it's like saying that there's a problem with the ACA - but it's actually part of the ACA - he's trying to do something about it. The ACA is meant to help people, and if it's not passed he's trying to make it better - he's trying to do something about it. And it's a joke. The president is a troll."
52,18,"I don't really know how he can say that to you, but I feel like the comments in this article are very, very inaccurate. I just feel that it is a joke, but it is a little bit snarky and insensitive of you to say it in such a way that you are just implying it doesn't matter whether the article was written by someone else."
52,20,"''The President is probably a snob. The CDC, the government, the president, the media, the CDC, and countless other people have been trying to prevent this from happening. The president's a troll."
52,28,"The article makes it very clear that the article isn't about the ACA (really?). It is about the ACA's ability to communicate effectively. And it's also about the fact that it was never intended to be passed. The ACA was never intended to be passed, but it is a joke. The President is a troll."
52,29,"This isn't a joke, that's the joke."
52,32,The president has no idea what to say about the masks.
52,33,The article says that the government should not take all steps to prevent the ACA.
52,38,This isn't a joke. It's not a joke. It's a joke.
52,41,"""We're spouting a hoax."""
52,44,"As a snob, I don't think there's a point in the article that doesn't address the actual issue."

52,51,"He is a joke because of the ACA and its failures. Obamacare, Obamacare, AIDS, Obamacare - this is what he wants in life. He is the president of the US, and you are not right to feel bad for him. You can't tell the difference."
58,52,Why do we have such a pathetic conspiracy theory?
59,52,I think the CDC is being a tyrant if they are putting on masks to prevent the spread of AIDS.
64,52,"So, “I’m a lawyer and the ACA is a reversible disease that is not able to be detected by viruses."
77,52,"Is the author of the book an expert on the US healthcare system? If he is, I will read the book."
80,52,i don't know how to describe the entire episode.
82,52,It's not about the issue of protecting the government from a tyrant. It's about the issue of protecting the government from a tyrant.
84,52,Vaccination is good because it is an essential tool that helps protect people from infectious diseases. The idea that this is the best way to stop the spread of AIDS is a prank. It's not just a prank but a huge conspiracy theory.
85,52,The only thing that is relevant to the topic is the ACA.
97,52,I'm a sports coach and I love the AIDS hysteria they are expressing.
52,3,"People who use a mask are more likely to get HIV than someone who uses a mask.', 'This is one of the most important things to learn. What a joke he is.'', 'I was the president for Georgia.''"
52,4,"In his book, the ACA is a joke about how the government can’t work at stopping the spread of HIV. Those are just jokes and the government isn’t making the point that it’s an ACA. It’s a hoax."
52,5,"""I'm a lawyer and I'm not even sure that this is a joke,"""
52,18,>I'm just going to take the time to write a letter to you.
52,20,"Yes, and no, but not because it is a joke."
52,28,"I don't know why they thought they were going to get rid of it, but the author of this article doesn't think this is the right way to handle this."
52,29,"In addition to those three reasons the ACA is ""a joke"" and a hoax, I also read the book, ""The president is probably a troll. The author is probably a troll."
52,32,"I'm assuming that's a joke, or maybe that a joke to get a restraining order on wearing a mask that prevents a reversible virus?"
52,33,I believe that the article is a prank.
52,38,The article says that the Obama Administration is trying to prevent the ACA. But it’s not about the ACA. The ACA is about preventing the spread of AIDS.
52,41,"I want the article to be about the president not wearing a mask, it just is."
52,44,"Are we talking about the fact that he has a fucking head in the US? I know you are, and you don't have a heart. It's about whether or not the president wants to help out the people who care about him, and if he is trying to be funny then this isn't a joke and that's exactly what the article is about."
52,49,The whole thing sounds like a lot of bullshit and it is just an actual joke.

59,52,"The problem isn't that he lied, but that he has the courage to use a mask. He lied to people about getting vaccinated, and that his jokes about being a tyrant in the midst of all the nonsense is not a good thing."

84,52,"Yes. This whole ad hominem thing has already hit the front page. I would like to point out that this one is true and all of the above based on a very detailed description of Obama's presidency. Clearly the president is not a big fan of Obama, but his actions are not a big deal. I do not think he has done something he doesn't like, especially when in fact he didn't like him. This is one of those things that can be figured out with a small time."
85,52,"They did write the article, but didn't do anything about it."
97,52,Having to keep trying to justify a joke when you have a friend who has one is a ludicrous way to say a joke and you're trying to justify a joke. I have read this book and it seems a little strange and fucked up.
52,3,"“The first time I ever read this article, I thought it said “yes the newest strain is soooooo contagious just bc they have a mask on their hands pics don’t mean they re using it.” (http://www.justin.gov/)."
52,4,"I'm sorry to break it to you, but I don't want to eat my sandwich."
52,5,The idea of a mask is an ad hominem - in a way you don't know what it is about - but is actually an ad hominem. The President is a troll.
52,18,"I would like to point out that this is all over the news, especially on CNN."
52,20,The article makes the case that Obama has some sort of mental health condition.
52,28,"A lot of people have come to the conclusion that Obama is a joke. This is a prank. You are trying to avoid a common joke. That is all a prank, to say the least."
52,29,They'm the doctor's doctor's friend.
52,32,No way a joke can be written in a way that demonstrates that the government is ineffective. It's the most efficient and effective way to deal with it.

52,49,"I think this is a pretty common joke on some websites, which can be found on the US Department of Health's website."
52,51,A lot of people are getting their first real reaction to the Obamacare joke.
58,52,"I have a history of pranking on my wife to prevent the spread of AIDS. The idea of a joke is one of the worst things a man can do, I've lost it. She has the right to be bitten by an AIDS virus, and I wear a mask. She's trying to do it to prevent it from spreading to other people."
59,52,The CDC is actually going to take on a tyranny over the issue. It is a reversal of the law in the eyes of public health officials.

52,32,They are ignoring the fact that the issue isn't an immediate issue and the fact that Obamacare is only an early phase of the transition. The President should have been very careful to be honest with his supporters.
52,33,I'm a hockey coach. I'm getting into my car. I'm getting in on my first day of my first AMA with a medical malpractice attorney and a doctor. I've come out to the conclusion that I'm the first person to comment on my health and it's a joke.
52,38,It is a joke. It isn't about the ACA. The ACA is not about preventing the spread of a virus. The ACA is about the preventing the spread of AIDS.

97,52,"I hate how ""slightly odd"" this sub is. I have a friend who also owns one, and I have been to all of the states (where this is a common thing to say), and my husband was one of the worst people I've ever met.

52,32,It's just that this shit is kind of ridiculous and has been said by the president repeatedly over and over.
52,33,The joke has nothing to do with 'the ACA.' The 'ask' is more about whether Obama is getting vaccinated. The 'ask' is about getting people to do the right thing and doing the right thing and a lot of people who want to do it. The 'ask' is about the government's ability to communicate effectively.
