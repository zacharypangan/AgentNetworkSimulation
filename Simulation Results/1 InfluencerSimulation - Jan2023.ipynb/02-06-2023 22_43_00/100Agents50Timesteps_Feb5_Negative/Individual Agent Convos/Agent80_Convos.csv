80,18,"The NSA, at least in New York, has a good policy of preventing the spread of infectious diseases."
80,29,"If you really want to win it, that's not in any way an excuse to do that."
80,42,"They want the players to wear masks and throw a jab because of the economic problems i believe. Obviously, i can understand your frustration with them, but they also don't want them to have to worry about being able to use their taser on their teammates."
80,44,I think the government should be allowing those employees to do this. They are not willing to put people on health insurance that can't be protected from HIV
80,50,"I think you should stop playing the game because you are not wearing a mask and you have no choice but to wear a mask if you do not want to wear it, and you should be allowed to do that and have your life ruined by it."
80,52,They should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force if a mask isn't worn properly.
80,53,"I don't know what you mean by 'unfortunate', but I think a lot of this is going to change, and some people just don't agree with it."
80,58,Wearing a mask or getting the jab is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
80,70,Honestly you don't need to be on the team but to be in the position to be able to wear a mask can make a huge difference. It's a big difference but only if you're going to be wearing it professionally.
80,72,> I love coaching however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops.

97,80,"You should come to Colorado, just don't play on the internet. You don't even think the entire state is a state?"
80,2,"Yeah, we get it. The government isn't really supposed to do anything for the NSA. There is an actual rule that allows the players to wear a mask to stop the spread of viruses. But it still causes problems with your ability to choose to wear the mask."
80,6,"You are not against them, you are against them. This nonsense should be stopped because you are not against the NSA or other health services. The NSA is not willing to stop the spread of HIV. This is the problem that is most peoples problem, they are not willing to allow people to wear a mask in order to stop the spread of the disease."
80,16,"You have to work hard to maintain a positive image of the state you play on, right? The best way to keep up with this is for the players to wear a mask when not wearing a mask. If the coach has been in his position a few times the time he's in position to change, the game might be over."
80,18,"I know right. I know the fact that it seems like you're on reddit just to find out that you are a legitimate citizen in Colorado. So no, the whole state is a state."
80,29,[You do not even think the entire state is a state?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Company/company/common_disadvantages_of_narcissism).
80,42,"It seems like the ""revolutionary government"" has a taser law to force players to wear a mask. It doesn't imply that it is something NSA can do or prevent, but they do so by forcing a decision based on their own convictions."
80,44,Why are these mandates in the US? Are they in the US? Or is it the US? Are there any regulations to prevent this? I'd think that a mask is a way to prevent it from spreading in the US.
80,50,"Isn't it because there are people on the net who don't know what the fuck they're talking about? Like, if you're a kid and you're going to have a bad time in front of your parents, why do you care? Why is fucking the game fun? Why is it fun to get in the face of that?"
80,52,"We're not talking about the laws that make up a federal law, we're talking about a federal law that allows players to wear the mask and get tasers when they play on the Internet, which are considered inconsequential."
80,53,"Wearing a mask or getting the jab is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. I don't know what you mean by 'unfortunate', but I think a lot of this is going to change, and some people just don't agree with it."
80,58,"Then, by all means, please suck a squirt of blood. I'll try to play the game but I want to leave this thread."
80,70,It's a big difference. It's a big difference but only if you're going to be wearing it professionally.

97,80,"Then it wouldn't be a problem for them, but it would certainly not stop a PG team from playing any football. The US government doesn't enforce anti-virus laws. People have been banned from wearing masks for years because of this."
80,2,That is probably because they aren't making any rules about whether you should wear a mask. They are allowing the players to be able to be the one who is in charge of your team.
80,6,The reason why they don't allow that is because they don't know what the fuck they're talking about.
80,16,"I'm not going to pretend that I'm a legal citizen but the NSA has already issued a NSA directive that allows players to wear a mask when not wearing one, which is pretty awesome if they really don't want it in the US."
80,18,"If you don't mind us mentioning it, why aren't all those kids just on the internet?"
80,29,"I'm not against vacks mandates, but the government can and should help combat this in some way."
80,42,"I can see that not being able to use a mask for a narcissistic job, but you know, is probably one of the first things that comes to mind when you think about this... It sounds like you've learned that this kind of behavior is sexist."
80,44,"If you can't wear a mask, you're a scumbag."
80,50,"Having a good friend play a lot of sports is a great thing. The fact that you can't say, ""i'm against this"" is enough to convince me I should."
80,52,Isn't that the point of a mask that prevents a person from being sick because of a disease?
80,53,"... and in case there isn't a lot of this here, the issue is not that you are not a legitimate citizen, but that the government is not supposed to do anything. This is a state-wide issue, but a federal law isn't enough for it."
80,58,"i have an opinion on the NSA and cant say that it is a federal law, but i've heard a lot of things about the military (and the people) and the role it plays in the NSA in the CDC. that i'm a pvp cheerleader (and that i'm against them). It does seem like the NSA is doing everything for the national security."

80,75,This seems like the NSA is inefficient and unfriendly.
97,80,"I've been to the US, and I know that I'm going to go to the USA and get a helmet."
80,2,"I like to think of it as wearing a mask as part of the NSA’s job security, and the fact that they make a ton of money on the process that they use."
80,6,There are plenty of things that the NSA can and should help with that aren't in the NSA.
80,16,"I don't see the point of a mask being an effective defense mechanism, but I don't think we should allow it. We need to be able to get rid of all of the 'VAC mandates' that have been used against the American government and the current 'MAC mandates' and that would be more effective than just changing a uniform / mask on the field in the next 10 years. We should give them a pass, but at the end of the day I don't think it's a big problem in the world."
80,18,"People can still go to the NFL, if they want to... the NSA is not the right one to do this."
80,29,"This sounds like the only option available in this country, I think you should check out [http://www.csu.gov/science/science/science/science/science/science_and_science.pdf](http://www.csu.gov/science/science_and_science.pdf)."
80,42,"I have heard of this before : ""The NSA is doing everything for national security. I love football, I love football - there is nothing illegal about being on the team or playing on the internet."
80,44,"It's not sexist. You can't even afford a mask that prevents you from contracting a disease, and if you do not know why it is there, the government is not going to do anything about it. You can't just buy a mask for the purpose of preventing the spread of a virus, but you can buy one for someone else."
80,50,"I was just trying to ask a question. I just don't understand why the internet is so dreadful. Is it good to be in a sports team with a bunch of kids? Do I have to wear my mask? If not, I'm not sure it's good enough to be in the NFL."

80,53,"I have no idea if you're saying that, but the truth is, the government doesn't have to enforce anti-virus laws."
80,58,"I don't think I'd be allowed to use a mask or get a jab, though, if there's a mask out there to prevent someone from getting sick..."
80,70,I was at a CDC. The NSA did something about this (flashing a fad virus) and I'm surprised they didn't cite the link.
80,72,"I don't know if this is legal, but I do know it's a crime. It's a crime, not a law. It's not something the government can and should be doing, unless its in violation of the anti-virus law."
80,75,"In some countries, you can get a'mock' and get a mask. In others it is not."
97,80,"He slammed the post into my head, like a real guy who was a professional game coach."
80,2,"They are doing that for the safety of the American people, not the health of their nation."
80,6,I have a phobia of the government and its ability to prevent viruses by blaming it on you.
80,16,"Those are the kind of fads people who want to get away with it. They aren't a government agency, they are a government agency that doesn't want you to get in trouble and they are just in power to make you go in with them."
80,18,"Yes, it's illegal, and the NSA is sexist."
80,29,This is a good post.
80,42,This is a good question. Is it sexist that you do not have to wear your mask.
80,44,/r/AmericanAgePerson.html
80,50,I don't understand how there is a national security system where people can play sports without a mask or to wear a mask.
80,52,"You can't just buy a mask, though, if there's a mask out there to prevent a person from getting sick, but you can't afford it. The government doesn't have to enforce anti-virus laws. The NSA can and should be doing anything they want to, but it's not illegal, and not illegal in most places."
80,53,I read a few sentences about the government's role in the government. They are very ineffective.
80,58,"This is not something the NSA is doing, and isn't something that should be allowed."
80,70,"It's a violation of the anti-virus law. Wearing a mask does not protect against a virus (you aren't allowed to wear it in any other way). The NSA is doing everything for national security, and the government doesn't have to enforce anti-virus laws."
80,72,"I don't like the NSA, but it's a crime in the US."
80,75,"I agree, the NSA is the only solution I've heard of. The NSA has never attempted to stop an epidemic of AIDS."
97,80,A coach can be a coach in their own right when he's not playing for him.
80,2,"I don't think it is sexist at all. That is part of what I think people should be doing. I believe that we should be able to use masks on ourselves, or else we are not allowed to do so."
80,6,"The guy you are answering is very naive. I'm not saying it is sexist that you don't have to wear a mask. I mean if the guy you are talking about didn't even mention this, I think it's just a weird assumption. But I was speaking as if you were referring to a real guy who is a coach. The guy that I was speaking to, he actually said he wants to work at a hospital, but he doesn't want to be able to do so."
80,16,"The NSA is a government agency. They haven't tried to stop AIDS, but it's a crime and there are several other ways to do it."
80,18,"[Also see my comment about this]. [NAME] is saying ""No NSA, but i think they should be doing nothing."""
80,29,I agree with the other commenters here. You have a right to express your opinions and beliefs in the way the NSA and the military are doing.
80,42,"Well, y'know, I hate that stuff. It's a crime to not wear a mask, but you can do it anyway, even if they are not allowed to."
80,44,>I'm not against vacks mandates cuz they ruin the economy get people fired and people should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force.

80,52,"I think it's pretty hard to have a private conversation with the president, and I'd hate to hear from a fellow president like this."
80,53,So you said he was a fag.
80,58,"I would like to add that a video game that is a mask in an emergency situation and that someone is injured in a crash is considered a crime, and is allowed to play without a mask if it carries a virus that is the name of an illness in your body. If you need a mask, the answer to this question is... the same thing. You should read the whole post."
80,70,"I believe that the NSA is trying to keep the government's role in the public health system from being disrupted. It's just a big fad, if not a legitimate one. It's pretty simple."
80,72,That s a real question. How can they make a legitimate point about the dangers of the NSA?
80,75,Is there a difference between going to the CDC and being a CDC volunteer? I am not a CDC volunteer but I just got a job at the CDC. I had to walk the CDC to get a mask to work because they would show me what the program was. It was all about playing football.
97,80,"The op is not a bad coach, but he's one of the bad guys in this situation. The guy is clearly a dick and if he isn't on the team he's a dick."
80,2,"Is that the government's role in the public health system? Because, hey, the government is acting for national security."
80,6,"> It's a crime to not wear a mask, but you can do it anyway, even if they are not allowed to."
80,16,"awww, it's pretty obvious this is a lie."
80,18,The fact that this is so true is a bit strange. I'm really glad the guy isn't even going to be elected to be a president.
80,29,"I think it would be better to be honest, and if you didn't, you wouldn't be at a political disadvantage."
80,42,"This post isn't the type of post where they aren't being real about what's going on, and they aren't even trying."
80,44,"So I'm saying ""No NSA, but i think they should be doing nothing."""
80,50,"I think the problem is that if a lot of kids play sports on the internet without their masks, they will not notice the problem. I think this is what sexist is, and i know that a lot of people have no idea what sex is, and there are also a lot of people that do not have sex with masks. The fact that this is true is all you need to know."
80,52,I like that they are trying to prevent the spread of AIDS but they aren't doing it to stop it.
80,53,"I think it's pretty obvious to be a fan of the government. The government is not trying to prevent the spread of AIDS. It's a crime for the NSA to impose a law that identifies as ""fag"" and also the government has no legitimate interest in preventing it."
80,58,I think that the NSA is using the NSA to stop the spread of a virus.
80,70,>I love football - there is nothing illegal about being on the team or playing on the internet. And what about the public health system?
80,72,"'I love coaching however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops',"
80,75,I think I just figured that the NSA was ineffective and should be addressing this issue more clearly.
97,80,"I have read the articles about football (not just the guy, but many other comments) and they are pretty straight forward and clear on the situation."
80,2,I don't think it's that crazy. I'm more concerned with the fact that this guy is being abused.
80,6,The person who doesn't really care is the one who's just asking.
80,16,"I was really interested in learning what AIDS is? Basically, if I had been a coach I would be against this. If I was on the field and didn't have a helmet I wouldn't be wearing one. And if I was on the field I would not be allowed to wear it. Unless I was a coach I would be against the NSA."
80,18,">I like that they are trying to prevent the spread of AIDS. It's a crime for the NSA to impose a law that identifies as ""fag"" and also the government has no legitimate interest in preventing it."
80,29,Nope. They don't actually have to do something.
80,42,"If they are going to ban any kind of fad, then fads aren't a big deal. If they are, I think it would be ridiculous to ban the NSA entirely without the help of a private company."
80,44,I like the NSA is trying to keep the government's role in the public health system from being disrupted.
80,50,"I don't see why you're suggesting a specific definition of ""must wear a mask,"" as in a mask to protect yourself from infections. I don't think it's worth noting that some of the same things you're saying are true for every other category - that some people have a tendency to be anti-virus because they believe that if they don't, their health will not be as bad as what they think they are. That's a bit odd because, in general, it would be funny to tell people about the government to do that. The"

The government is acting to protect the public, but it isn't going to stop the spreading of AIDS. I'm sorry, but I'm sorry that he isn't even going to be a presidential candidate."
80,58,"I don't think a mask would stop that. I just think that if people in that position figured it out, then a new shitlord wouldn't have gotten the NSA to stop the spread of the virus."
80,70,"I hate the post, but I don't blame the CDC, for not having an actual job at the CDC."
80,72,I think you are missing the point of this thread.

80,42,I genuinely think it would be absurd to ban the NSA because it will put a huge amount of pressure on the civilian population to carry it.
80,44,i want to get this out there a lot.
80,50,The NSA is doing nothing to stop the spread of a virus. The idea of using a mask is ridiculous. Taking the NSA away from the public is like taking a gun and tripping over people. I'm just trying to get you to come up with a name for my post...
80,52,It's ridiculous. This is all the context I've had in the past.
80,53,"This is the first part of my comment in the whole thread. There is not much context here, but it's definitely an interesting thought that you're trying to provide. I don't see why they're doing anything wrong, and just don't want to see how it's gonna make the entire conversation much worse."
80,58,"The NSA is an integral part of the public health system, it's only used to prevent an illness from being spread to the entire country. It's a government thing that they need to make clear. I know it is not sexist but that does not make it sexist."
80,70,"It's a good idea to have people on your team, but it's a great way to make it so that it can affect people who might otherwise be at risk of getting sick. Then everyone else has to agree to work together to prevent people from faking a virus."
80,72,"It's not that you don't like the NSA and I'm a really nice person. But you do seem to like that you are being offended, which is what I think."
80,75,It's the president's job. There's nothing wrong with it. It's one of the ways to keep the country safer.
97,80,CANNOTANSWER: [NAME] and a few others. I think a few people were right to be pissed.
80,2,I was on the field and couldn't believe you were there for them. I was on the team with no helmet but it was a helmet and the players couldn't do it.
80,6,"No. You need to find out. It's up to you to decide if you're a sexist or not. There's absolutely no point in allowing someone to use a mask, it's just to keep the economy open."
80,16,"I'm not a lawyer, but this is about how the government gets the mandates done. A mask if not wearing it is not going to stop the spread of AIDS."
80,18,The NSA's role in protecting the public is one of the 'best measures' to keep the country safe and ensuring that people can be aware of the problem.
80,29,"I was not the only one, I only drew a gilded black brow and I didn't..."
80,42,I was in an interview with a former coach once who was a coach. It was actually quite good. It's not sexist that they didn't make the right choice. That's the point.
80,44,>I just read it as ''I hate the post'' This is all the context I've had in the past.
80,50,The NSA has been around for a very long time. They are being a part of a large group of people who want to use the internet to stop spread of a virus.
80,52,"There is a lot going on with these NSA mandates, and I hope that a couple of those are correct."
80,53,You need to stop being in a war with the government and stop being a fan.
80,58,"I'm saying that they are doing nothing wrong, but they are doing something wrong."
80,70,"""You have to make sure your team doesn't get trolled."""
80,72,The NSA is being used to stop the spread of a virus.
80,75,"""This seems like the NSA is inefficient and unfriendly."
97,80,i see what you mean. i'm a football coach and i'm into football a lot and i'm excited to see where the next president will go and see if i can take a trip.
80,2,">You aren't against scumbag government mandates, you are against scumbag government mandates"
80,6,">You are not against them, you are against them. This nonsense should be stopped because you are not against the NSA or other health services. The NSA is not willing to stop the spread of HIV."
80,16,"This makes a lot of sense. They are working for the U.S. government to protect people from AIDS, which is why they need to be clear that you're against it and that you're against it. It's like saying you were on the team and wanted to change a helmet for some reason and couldn't afford to pay for it, but they didn't do it because they think the other players were offended, not because of how big of a problem it is."
80,18,The NSA is using this to stop the spread of AIDS.
80,29,"Yes, if you grew up with a mask, you'd want to look like an artist. It's not sexist, but it's a good idea."
80,42,"""It seems like the ""revolutionary government"" has a taser law to force players to wear a mask. It doesn't imply that it is something NSA can do or prevent, but they do so by forcing a decision based on their own convictions."""
80,44,The president has done a lot of things.
80,50,What is the difference between a mask and a mask?
80,52,"I'd like a gilded black brow, but I'm not sure that I can go through all of this without seeing the entire wikipedia article of the NSA."
80,53,I have never been asked to speak like that on a regular basis. I just don't understand how this is happening to this country.
80,58,It's not a joke in the first place.
80,70,"Is there anyone that thinks 'You can't make the NSA a'sleep-in-the-face' way? The NSA is actually being used to stop the spread of a virus. The NSA is working hard to stop a virus and not even stop it, is that not illegal?"
80,72,CANNOTANSWER:
80,75,"I think I read it as ''I hate the post'', ""It's the president's job. There's nothing wrong with it. It's one of the ways to keep the country safe."""
97,80,"I think it's more a sign of frustration than an excuse. It's so ridiculous and disgusting that even a professor can tell us to ""afford"" to work there - that when the President has an idea that will help him ""get to the top"" of the game."
80,2,"So, why does the president seem to feel he has done so much to prevent the spread of the virus?"
80,6,The President should have a clear definition of if the disease is spreading. I think it's more a sign of frustration than an excuse.
80,16,CANNOTANSWER: I think I read it as ''I hate the post''.
80,18,">The fact that this is so true is a bit strange. I'm really glad the guy isn't even going to be elected to be a president."", ""Hey, this was interesting to me, and I think it's really interesting that you wrote this about the NSA and their own actions."""

80,42,It's also not a crime to not wear a mask.
80,44,Why did you decide to post this?
80,50,"The NSA is a lot of scum in the sense that they are trying to keep people safe if they do not comply. So, this is exactly what I'm talking about here."
80,52,You should not use the phrase 'what's the difference between a mask and a mask' as an excuse.
80,53,"The NSA is not a government agency, it is a government."
80,58,People are supposed to be immune to the government's threats. It doesn't. It's illegal to be a scumbag and make the government stop them.
80,70,"Well I like that ""you have to make sure your team doesn't get trolled."" And this is why I think it's a good idea."
80,72,CANNOTANSWER:
80,75,"What do you mean ""I'm not against vacks mandates cuz they ruin the economy get people fired and people should be able to choose to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force""? I know I know this, but I haven't been to the CDC."
97,80,"The whole point of it all is to stop the spread of a virus. The president is a fantastic athlete and an amazing player. He should put on a mask and play football. Yes. If they don't see the issue, then they won't get enough votes to make a statement. I think we need to do something about it."
80,2,I would call this an act of aggression from the government.
80,6,"It's not illegal to be against the NSA's mandates because they're naive. But there are a few rules there that don't apply to a lot of sexist acts like it, and they don't require you to do the right thing."
80,16,">The president is a fantastic athlete and an amazing player. He should put on a mask and play football. Yes. If they don't see the issue, then they won't get enough votes to make a statement."
80,18,"I've just learned the phrase ""The President is a fantastic athlete and an amazing player. He should put on a mask and play football."
80,29,Why do you think the guy isn't even going to be elected to be a president?
80,42,"You're the president. You need to move on with your life, this is the President."
80,44,"I don't like to talk about the government but it's just part of the reason people voted to keep the government from spreading the virus. That being said, there are a number of different ways to prevent that from spreading and the government has to find an way to stop the spread of that virus."
80,50,"It's called 'The National Security Agency', and it's very well deserved."
80,52,The fact that the president has a right to the airspace is quite telling. I'm just glad you aren't even going to be the president.
80,53,What is not a government agency?
80,58,"It's legal to wear a mask without a helmet, but it is not a criminal offense. They use the device to prevent a TB and then if it has an virus in it it isn't illegal."
80,70,"I don't think the president's ""desperately working"" approach to the NSA is the one who's going to be attempting to get his name out of the NSA's mainstream media."
80,72,We will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops.
80,75,I think that people should be able to choose to wear a mask and take the jab. That's not a joke.
97,80,This isn't a joke. This is a dick joke.
80,2,What do you mean? You're not saying that you're against it. You're saying that you're against it.
80,6,What a wonderful man. I'm so glad he's not going to be the president.
80,16,"The President has been making a lot of nonsense about the Bush administration to stop a scumbag like Obama from being a bad guy, and the president has been making huge moves to stop it from happening again and again. His comments seem to be pretty eloquent and a bit insulting and depressing."
80,18,"I mean, if you're trying to get a piece of information, it doesn't mean you're being an asshole. This isn't about sexism, it's about a law. They don't care about the rule."
80,29,A mask is a form of protection against a virus. If someone goes over there with a shaved head they should be wearing a mask.
80,42,The president should have had the opportunity to stop the taser bans and prevent the spread of viruses.
80,44,Is there some sort of legal law to prevent a person from taking the NSA's help?
80,50,I don't know. What's the big deal about all the masks they use to prevent the spread of a virus?
80,52,"I know the president fucked around, but the fact that the NSA is doing nothing in order to stop the spread of a virus is a dick joke."
80,53,"It's a crime for the NSA to impose a law that identifies as ""fag"" and also the government has no legitimate interest in preventing it."
80,58,"I agree with the other replies. I mean the NSA doesn't care if it doesn't stop you from getting sick, but it's doing something right."
80,70,"You aren't on the team, it's just not the team."
80,72,I don't think you're making the right point.
80,75,I've actually come across this phrase before in my work with our state's health department as a result of a virus infection.
97,80,"A ""silent fuck"" at football is actually a joke."
80,2,I think it's an inflammatory response and I hope it ends a little better than the president.
80,6,You're doing a really good job of putting forth your own voice to make the country a better place.
80,16,"""""What do you mean?"" ""what do you mean?"" "" ""Machine isn't a good protection mechanism, it is a good protection mechanism and it isn't an effective defense mechanism"""" ""Hey guys, I just wanted to tell you that I'm not the guy who's going to go to the media for a shit talk about that. I don't think it's a good idea to do it with your team if you don't want to be a shit joke."", ""I don't think the president"
80,18,he's actually a wonderful football player
80,29,... I'm trying to figure out why Obama didn't just call a game a joke.
80,42,The NSA has been making moves to stop a virus from spreading across the country and the country is a bit of a prick for it. They also use it to keep the government from doing sexist stuff.
80,44,I can't understand your whole point of view.
80,50,"I think the idea of wearing a mask to prevent TB is a little offensive. If you don't want to, you are not permitted to play sports in public places."
80,52,">Isn't that the point of a mask that prevents a person from being sick because of a virus?"","
80,53,The President is actually making a statement about this to the NSA.
80,58,[Sir] You are absolutely correct that this is not a joke.
80,70,"I'd say that if you want to stop faking it, your job is to make it illegal."
80,72,I think you are missing the point of this thread.
80,75,"They're being a dick. And they don't seem to understand that, at least not yet. They're just so dumb and ignorant, they can't even understand why anyone would care."
97,80,What's even more interesting is that they said the president should go to the white house with a mask and play football.
80,2,"a lot of people aren't even comfortable with the idea that ""the NSA doesn't care about preventing TB spread"" is a joke. They're just a dick."
80,6,>I think it's more a sign of frustration than an excuse. But do I really need to find out. It's up to you to decide if you're a sexist or not. There's absolutely no point in allowing someone to wear a mask
80,16,You are just as insensitive to what they're saying as they are to the president.
80,18,I'm going to go back to read the post.
80,29,"I don't think Obama was a joke. This is just a stupid, stupid article."
80,42,"I just want to add that I can understand the frustration with the players. I mean the NSA doesn't care if it doesn't stop you from getting sick, but it's doing something right. You aren't on the team, it's just not the team. I can't understand your whole point of view. I mean the NSA doesn't care if it doesn't stop you from getting sick, but it's doing something right. You aren't on the team, it's just not the team."
80,44,I think you're being a bit hypocritical.
80,50,"I'm gonna get my life ruined, the NSA is an amazing business."
80,52,"I've read this before and not only does it look like something they're doing, it's even worse than a full mouthed ""dick joke"" like that. What a fucking joke."
80,53,This guy got a nice guy.
80,58,The President is actually making a statement about this to the NSA.
80,70,"Then, you'll need to come up with some real BS. That's just part of the story. It's like saying I like football - I don't like it. Especially the way this game was a joke."
80,72,"'Mash a mask is a crime', 'You're not on the team, it's just not the team.'"
80,75,"""...I think it's a little offensive. Taking the NSA away from the public is like taking a gun and tripping over people."""
97,80,Is there a post somewhere else that specifically states that the president shouldn't be allowed to wear a mask?
80,2,"The first paragraph is a little harsh and sexist, but this is a bit of an extreme example of this."
80,6,I don't think it's necessary to wear a mask to prevent the spread of a virus.
80,16,It was a joke and I don't think any of them are going to say anything to the players.
80,18,"It's been awhile, but there seems to be a little misunderstanding going on here. That the President is being very anti-virus and anti-HIV, and not faking it, or what he's doing is actually actually sexist. That the NSA can't stop a person from faking it, then tells them that they have a legitimate interest in stopping that, and then tells them they're doing the right thing."
80,29,People are complaining about this guy.
80,42,I think that was the main point of the original post. It seems like everyone was trying to make the president think that there's nothing to stop the NSA from doing sexist things. They did what they could to get rid of it.
80,44,[I'm against VAKs mandates cuz they ruin the economy get people fired and people should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force](http://www.reddit.com/r/AgePerson.html/subreddit/fakenews/articles/0/employees_non_relative_narcissist_disappointment/) [Sir)

80,58,I think it's better to let someone go outside and play a game that doesn't have a mask than the NSA.
80,70,I read that one here. I was a bit confused but it got pretty old after all. I thought that was all about the symbiosis of the NSA.
80,72,What a stupid and stupid joke.
80,75,A good candidate for president should know that he's a dick and a good candidate for VP. He needs to be given some recognition for his integrity.
97,80,"I'd like to add to this that the whole concept of a mask is so over the top it's just not funny. You're being silly, don't think you can go to the white house with a mask, and if they don't want to have a conversation about it, then don't talk about it. You could try getting the joke out there and talk about the ""fucking thing that would save lives."" That's the only comment I've ever read, and I've read about a while back in the future.

80,2,"I know you're being sarcastic, but I really think the president is being silly and a dick. You're a dick and a dick. It's sad to see a President that's clearly a dick."

80,44,"""The president is a scumbag and I hate the idea of being the NSA. You're not right. It sounds like the NSA is trying to keep the government's role in the public health system from being disrupted."""
80,50,"""...but they should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force'', 'I think you should stop playing the game because you are not wearing a mask and you have no choice but to wear a mask if you do not want to wear it, and you should be allowed to do that and have your life ruined by it."

80,58,"The issue here is not that the NSA wants to stop the spread of AIDS, but that the CDC is being used to prevent that spread by preventing people from getting sick. It's that the CDC is trying to prevent that spread. I'm saying that the NSA is doing nothing wrong, but they are doing something wrong. The problem here is that the president is trying to get rid of the mask, and also to prevent the spread of AIDS."
80,70,"If the president actually did something to stop the spread of AIDS, he'd have an effective law against that. Then, he could go to a shill and do something to get rid of it."

80,2,"The president has made a lot of money from the NSA's NSA surveillance programs, and I'd like to think that they are doing more good than they should be, to stop the spread of AIDS. The NSA is essentially giving free medical research to those who don't want to get sick."

80,18,The president is getting a lot of credit for being a shill. And the fact that he was so good at preventing a virus is the reason the NSA was so bad.

80,72,'This is a great one.'
80,75,"The article says that if the CDC tries to prevent a virus, it will have a huge impact on AIDS awareness. That's why the mask is not needed. It's not a crime. It's a law. Those people need to be given the chance to go to school."
97,80,The president is a troll - he's not a troll.
80,2,I'm going to go rewatch this.
80,6,It is possible for you to wear a mask to prevent the spread of a virus. It isn't a crime to allow anyone to use it unless it is against the anti-virus law.

80,29,"I don't think the CDC has a right to let the president wear a mask, but the NSA could not enforce those laws."

80,50,"""I think I'm getting a lot of shit for not taking responsibility for the issue."
80,52,"The question is why is this being addressed? Because when the NSA is trying to stop the spread of AIDS - they have absolutely nothing to do with it, and it's against the law to say it's a problem - we are essentially talking about it as a public health issue, and there's no reason not to know what it's about. There is no reason to do it, and if it's not a problem, it's not a problem, unless they are doing it, which is very likely what they are doing on the internet"

80,70,I think the NSA is in some weird place where it's not necessary for you to see a president wearing a mask. This would make you very angry at the president for doing anything to save his life. And the president should be doing something to help protect himself.
80,72,"I think that s a crime, that it is a crime, that it is a crime, but it's not a crime. It's not a crime if it is against the anti-virus law."

80,6,The president is trying to stop the spread of AIDS. The CDC is not going to allow people to use the mask to prevent AIDS. The NSA is not going to have a role in preventing HIV. The president is trying to prevent AIDS. The CDC is not going to help prevent it. The president has to get out and get people to do it. They are going to use it to get people to do it in the event the people who aren't doing it to get the virus to actually stop AIDS.
80,16,"It was a hysterical post, in that you mentioned ""I would have been against the president of the US of America for having this mask. Unless you were a coach. I wouldn't have done anything, but if I was on the field and didn't have a mask, I wouldn't have gone to the school."" (Simpson, NJ, 2005)."
80,18,"There is no law against it. The CDC is not required to use the mask, nor is it allowed to enforce it."
80,29,Is wearing a mask being used as a tool to stop the spread of a virus a crime or a crime?
80,42,"This is about a man getting a bad rep on a good job, that’s a good guy for his job, and is about a man getting a bad rep on a bad guy for his job.

80,44,"I'm not sure how it all fits into the context of the article. I can tell you, however, that the actual article is much more accurate."

80,53,>Wearing a mask or getting the jab is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
80,58,The President has no business getting any credit.
80,70,"It's not a crime if you don't have any reason to say ""No,"" because it's not a crime."
80,72,This is a great question.
80,75,I just wanted to make a note.
97,80,A good coach isn’t a good one. The president needs to change his policies to prevent the spread of AIDS.
