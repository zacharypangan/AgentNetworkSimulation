82,78,says the woman that wears the mask to protect herself lmao well dear the gun works the mask doesn t
84,78,i love coaching however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops
88,78,i m going to say this about twitchcon and masks you can hate me if the state town doesn t have an mandates you can t get mad that an event doesn t not sure if sd has any mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask
89,78,putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i ve ever done in my entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things
100,78,oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that
78,5,There are lots of statewide health boards out there that are doing it.
78,8,"I am a lawyer, and I am a lawyer."
78,12,I was there. I went to the school and got a new mask and the school didn't offer them a gift.
78,14,"I'm a deaf nut, but I hate that shit."
78,15,"A student from another city asked for the mask to wear after school to prevent the spread of a virus and it's an arbitrary vote. The answer was ""NAME"""
78,19,A scumbag with a mask that will not wear a helmet will resign and not even try to get the job
78,21,"It was a great post. It was the one that really stuck out to me, a lot of the OP had to mention."
78,23,"We've seen an example where the town doesn't want to be held responsible for the fact that a woman can't wear a mask, while her teammate doesn't wear a mask to protect herself."
78,31,A school and a state that doesn't have a CDC mandate and a local school does not get the mandate unless they are a public health agency and not a government agency.
78,33,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
78,37,"I'm sure someone would disagree, they're not even allowed to tell the truth"
78,40,That was the right decision for me to make. I will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops
78,42,I know the public health in my county isn't working on that and i just saw the same comment here
78,47,This is the most sexist thing I read at the moment. I know it was a prank but I didn't really know what it meant.
78,48,The problem is that it's one of the most important things in the state in the past 30 years.
78,58,"A school in Delaware has one who can not wear a mask. If that school was an exception to the order, they cannot continue to hold the order."
78,60,Apparently they're wearing the order because the teacher erect a huge scar on the girl's head.
78,65,A helmet is a sign that someone whose face is not visible is ill if someone tries to take it off to protect themselves.
78,70,There are other signs of this:
78,77,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
82,78,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
84,78,"In addition to the one that said 'one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops ', I thought it was a bit ridiculous to have said ""one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops i love coaching however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i"
88,78,"Vaccinated, people with boosters?"
89,78,It was supposed to be a bit like putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i ve done in my entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i ve done in my entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things
100,78,There is a new virus in the lungs that causes you to eat the food you eat? And no one really wants to talk about that oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that oh you dont like wearing your mask
78,5,"This is not a political comment. I think you sounded stupid, and would've just been as stupid as they are."
78,8,There is a new virus in the lungs that causes you to eat the food you eat? And no one really wants to talk about that oh you dont like wearing your mask
78,12,I guess there aren't enough people who could care less what you say about the school or the people they represent.
78,14,"I'm not a health dept, I'm a deaf nut. I don't know what your post is about."
78,15,"This is not a prank, this is a public health matter and the public health law is about preventing the spread of a virus."
78,19,It sounds like the public health system isn't working.
78,21,I don't even know what to do. I'm a little embarrassed if I hear something like this.
78,23,"I'm afraid we've only been around a year. It's not like a real joke and only a prank, but that doesn't change the fact that it isn't even in our statute or the law."
78,31,"You know what, I think the people who think that the CDC doesn't have a mandate or a mandate are just as crazy."
78,33,"What does a helmet really do? I can't remember which one, but it seems like they just wanted to prevent the virus from spreading. It's a helmet and doesn't work, so it's a good idea to have it on unless the school has the mandate, and if the school had the mandate, they could just take them off."
78,37,"I like the fact that this was a post with a lot of points about people getting off on stuff. It seems like this is pretty much a joke, but I don't think anyone is interested in it, at least in the context of why there are schools out there that are not on board with the mask. It's not a joke. This was a really stupid post, OP."
78,40,Well I don't know about you but I think the only reason this doesn't have any context at all is the lack of a proper education.
78,42,I think you're being sarcastic in the context of the first part.
78,47,"I don't want to say a joke, but this is a ridiculous one. It seems like the board is too busy announcing what is being done to stop the spread of the disease."
78,48,This is why I want to get an eye on the school and their CDC mandate.
78,58,I don't care about the facts. I'm not going to be a doctor.
78,60,"""We want to prevent the spread of the virus, I'll wear a mask in a heartbeat if you don't wear a mask... It's one of the most important measures deployed by the government"""
78,65,I don't think the question of wearing a mask is really relevant.
78,70,"This is one of the most important things in the state in the past 30 years. A school in Delaware has one who can not wear a mask. If that school was an exception to the order, they cannot continue to hold the order."
78,77,"I just read the entire post as ""I will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops"""
82,78,I believe the mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
84,78,"I am very sorry but you have to play with a coach, then he needs to be able to work on his own skills."
88,78,It's interesting that people who have had boosters can say that they are not vaccinated and still think that you are vaccinated. This is also why people have more awareness of the importance of being vaccinated.
89,78,"I'm going to try and tell you something, but I have to say I do not think this is a joke."
100,78,[NAME] is a guy who wears a mask on all the time to fight cancer and his family. The only people that don't like wearing a mask are people who don't like it.
78,5,You know I don't like wearing a mask. I don't like it.
78,8,This isn't a joke.
78,12,The school I was at did not have the ability to take on any responsibility. I was the mascot. They used it.
78,14,"I just read the whole post as ""I will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops"" I think this is a ridiculous one. It seems like the board is too busy announcing what is being done to stop the spread of the virus."
78,15,This is why I feel it's very important for people to get to know the facts.
78,19,I was in a school that was required to wear a mask in order to stop the spread of a virus. I had a lot of people who could not vaccinate themselves.
78,21,>The only people that don't like wearing a mask are people who don't like it.
78,23,I can only imagine what they are like as the same thing.
78,31,I'm sorry but that is just a joke! Is this the case? Is the CDC a government agency? Is the CDC involved with the CDC's program for public health?
78,33,"A little funny, but I think you're right that this is a really good joke. It's just something the administration would be too busy with putting the other party's name in."
78,37,I don't think people have a right to know the truth. It's not a joke. I can tell you that. And this is just an example of why people think it is so important. It doesn't matter that people don't like wearing a mask. It matters that a person doesn't feel that they need to be in the world to survive. This is why people who don't like wearing a mask don't feel uncomfortable in public.
78,40,"The problem with this is that you have to have a therapist or something like that to make sure you are doing the right thing. You have to learn that you will have to be vaccinated, because the CDC has a mandate. It's not a joke at all."
78,42,This guy wears a mask all the time to fight cancer and his family.
78,47,The one who voted against the mask public health order and did not vote - but only because I'm from Delaware - voted against it.
78,48,This is actually one of the most important things in the state in the past 30 years.
78,58,"I think a lot of schools, including our public health system, are under the misconception that the government needs to have a mandate to protect children from HIV/AIDS. That is part of what makes a good public health education."
78,60,"I don't even know what to do. I'm a little embarrassed if I hear something like this. I'm afraid we've only been around a year. It's not like a real joke and only a prank, but that doesn't change the fact that it isn't even in our statute or the law."
78,65,It's not a joke.
78,70,There are a couple of facts in this post that are pretty ridiculous.

82,78,"In the words of the article it says: ""When you get sick, you have to put on a mask... This is a lot of work in the ACA."
84,78,Then when the problem is solved they're going to continue to run it with a fear of the government (too many things) for fear of getting caught a virus.
88,78,TIL that people have no idea what a booster is.
89,78,"And then wearing it back on, to prevent any further infection from spreading."
100,78,"I don't like wearing a mask, but I do wear a mask when I'm feeling bad. If I'm really bad I wear a mask, like, 1 4 of the time."

78,12,There are a lot of things on the internet I would like to read. This is something the FDA could not seem to solve. I feel as though it would be a waste of time and effort to implement in their eyes.
78,14,"I think the problem is that there's so much work in the ACA that the people who don't like to wear a mask just have to put on a mask, because they can't tell the difference between what the vaccine will do and what it will do."
78,15,This is the sort of stuff that everyone has to do with people in their daily lives.
78,19,The CDC is involved in the CDC's program for public health. It is not a joke.
78,21,"I don't like wearing a mask, but I do wear a mask when I'm feeling bad. If I'm really bad I wear a mask, like, 1 4 of the time."
78,23,A good example of a joke. A bit of what?
78,31,So the kids wearing the mask are getting sick and not being vaccinated?
78,33,CDC - What’s the reason you have to wear a mask for a virus to kill you?
78,37,The article states that there's a mandate to protect children from HIV/AIDS.
78,40,"When you get sick, you have to put on a mask. This is a lot of work in the ACA. Then when the problem is solved they're going to continue to run it with a fear of the government (too many things) for fear of getting caught a virus."

78,48,"I’m afraid if you know the joke, the CDC should have an authority to take it down. If they do, they will have a mandate for it. If the CDC does not, you’re going to have to do it yourself."
78,58,It's a joke because the CDC is in the program.
78,60,"We have a lot of doctors and hospitals that provide you with the necessary care. There is some truth to this, but it's still the biggest joke of the 20th century."
78,65,It's not a joke. It's an example of why people think it is so important.
78,70,I think it's just a prank.

82,78,"CANNOTANSWER is describing a piece of information from the ACA that has been made public by the state. You could ask him to explain how the mask works. The ACA makes it illegal to wear a mask. I am not against the prohibition on using the ACA but if you are against this law, you are against allowing the use of the ACA."
84,78,>We'll resign and not coach until this nonsense stops.
88,78,"[The actual problem is how many people wear masks, and when it happens, they die. Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks."
89,78,"I read this in the spirit of the book, where the guy talks about how he was going to wear a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when he got to his table. It's about what he thought the doctor was going to do."
100,78,"This is the biggest problem with people. The more you think about it, the more you think it will actually work."
78,5,"No, it's not the joke. It's the fact that people think the government has to be in charge of prevention - and that's what the issue is. You're being silly here. I'd resign and tell him to stop using the ACA."
78,8,"It's in the original title, but isn't it?"

78,14,">When you get sick, you have to put on a mask. This is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
78,15,The ACA's mandate on preventing transmission of HIV/AIDS is a joke.
78,19,This is all part of why you can't buy a helmet.
78,21,"The people who are complaining about this need not be in the ACA. I don't know if they know what a mask is or if it's just a joke, but I think the best way to prevent an AIDS infection in the system is to get your vaccine in place in a form of a syringe."
78,23,"I don't know, we have a joke called ""We've seen an example where the town doesn't want to be held responsible for the fact that a woman can't wear a mask, while her teammate doesn't wear a mask to protect herself."""
78,31,You might think the government is not interested in the problem at hand?
78,33,"This is one of the most blatantly stupid things I've ever heard. I had to leave college just so I could not read the text, so I just started reading the article."
78,37,That's exactly what you say in a post.
78,40,I have had many AIDS patients that have got sick from wearing a mask.
78,42,"The point of ACA is to abolish it, even if it's not in effect."
78,47,I'd also suggest that the article says that the CDC is involved in the CDC's program for public health.
78,48,I'm not a nihilistic at all. What is the issue?
78,58,"When you get sick, you have to wear a mask. This is a lot of work in the ACA. The CDC is involved in the CDC's program for public health. It is not a joke."
78,60,"It's not like the government is doing a joke. It's a prank, and that's not fair."
78,65,It's not a joke. It's a prank.
78,70,"Yes, the mask law is a prank, but I think this is a joke."
78,77,So that’s why I’m an anti-HIV/AIDS supporter.
82,78,I feel like I've heard this so many times before. I'm a little upset with the fact that the president made it public that the ACA is affecting more people.
84,78,It's hard to see who is going to put up with the government's nonsense when the actual game is about something that you don't like.
88,78,"Is it possible that they were trying to cover up the problem by using an acronym, or is this something that the person in this sub are being extremely rude. Vaccines are not the right, you should not have to do it. The actual problem is how many people wear masks, and when it happens, they die. Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks."
89,78,"I think the difference is that there's no such thing as an “A good doctor wears a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when he gets to his table. It's about what he thought the doctor was going to do.” Besides, the problem isn't with the mask, but with the part of it that you don't like."
100,78,It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
78,5,The ACA is not a joke. It is a prank.
78,8,"...I have some fucking apologies, but there is no such thing as an ACA that isn't really a joke."
78,12,Apparently this doesn't change anything about this. I don't think the mask is part of the problem. That's pretty normal.
78,14,>This is all part of why you can't buy a helmet.
78,15,The ACA is a joke because the public health law abolitionists don't think they're entitled to be held responsible for their own lack of awareness of the problem.
78,19,>I am a little upset with the fact that the president made it public that the ACA is affecting more people. Is it possible that they were trying to cover up the problem?
78,21,I think the idea of the ACA causing more AIDS is a sham. It has nothing to do with the actual issue.
78,23,You need to read the articles about the mask law. It's not a joke. It's a joke.
78,31,Nope. The CDC is not involved in the program for public health. The mask laws don't even mention it.
78,33,You got the joke. The President made it public that the ACA is affecting more people. I'm sure he has a point.
78,37,"I'm a CDC staff member and am on the public health board. I know you want to buy a helmet. But no, I don't think the ACA is a joke. I'm saying it's one of the best ways to protect people from the virus. I think people have a right to know the truth. It's just a joke. The mask law is an ACA and isn't about it."
78,40,">The problem with this is that you have to have a therapist or something like that to make sure you are doing the right thing.

You have to learn that you will have to be vaccinated, because the CDC has a mandate."
78,42,"Yes, it's a joke."
78,47,"This is not a joke, it's a joke."
78,48,What are the other laws? You can't get sick by being ill without wearing a mask?
78,58,I just wanted to point out that I'm the person who has the largest public health population in the world. I didn't want to put myself in a situation where I'd have a problem with someone not wearing a mask or anything that would put me in a worse place. I don't even have a problem with the fact that the public health system's job in DE isn't to fight the disease.
78,60,There is nothing that can stop this from happening in this country. This is not really true. We are in the US and we know what the problem is and what we should do to stop it. If you ever find yourself in the govt or do any government service you should contact the Health Department and ask for assistance. We are in the US and they can help you.
78,65,"It's the ACA. If we're able to get the vaccine to be on the road or bus, people can wear a mask, but the problem isn't the mask, the ACA isn't really the way to get a vaccine. It's not a joke, but I think it's a prank."
78,70,[Little bit of trivia about wearing a mask:
78,77,"""This is actually what it is: I think a lot of schools, including our public health system, are under the misconception that the government needs to have a mandate to protect children from HIV/AIDS."""
82,78,>When I was a kid I was given this as an idea to use as a tool to prevent the spread of HIV infections by using a mask and the people here wanted it to be used to keep people from stealing it.
84,78,"You're taking a deep breath and saying this, ""You need a new generation of coaches that are able to understand the consequences of what they are doing."
88,78,I grew up on an island.
89,78,The movie was written by the guy in the book. It was supposed to be a joke. You're just thinking about why he wore the mask.
100,78,"I'm glad I could get through this. I do not think he should wear a mask, it's just that he's wearing a mask, because he feels like he's 'behaving badly' he shouldn't be able to see his breathing better. I think it's more of a reaction to the fact that he's telling his friends, ""I do like wearing a mask, but I do wear a mask when I'm feeling really bad."""
78,5,I can't believe this is being used as a joke.
78,8,So what if you can't find a CDC staff member who is working on public health and you need a CDC staffer that isn't a government employee?
78,12,"It was written by the guy who wrote the movie ""The Mask Law"""
78,14,"Yes, you can buy a mask if you are not wearing it. You don't need a mask if you are deaf."
78,15,Is wearing a mask the answer to a prank?
78,19,It's just a joke. People need to know the truth.
78,21,What do you think of this ACA? Why aren't people trying to protect themselves from the virus by wearing a mask? Is this an actual question or a joke?
78,23,"It's a joke, because you have to read a newspaper or a newspaper article about the government threatening a citizen with HIV. You're taking a deep breath to tell me what's a prank and you're talking about a prank aimed at public health."
78,31,Is there anything I can do about this?
78,33,A great example of this kind of joke. There's no excuse for it.
78,37,You're the person who has the largest public health population in the world. I'm the person who has the largest public health population in the world. I didn't want to put myself in a situation where I'd have a problem with someone not wearing a mask or anything that would put me in a worse place.
78,40,"I mean, the CDC mandate was just a joke and they had no basis to make it a joke."
78,42,The ACA is supposed to be a joke. It's not about the mask.
78,47,This is just a prank.
78,48,"You don't even have to have a therapist or something like that to make sure you are doing the right thing. You have to learn that you will have to be vaccinated, because the CDC has a mandate. Yes, it's a joke. It's not a joke, it's a joke."
78,58,You can't get AIDS without wearing a mask? I don't think you'd be able to tell if it's the same people who drank the drug.
78,60,This is a really good story.
78,65,"""I don't think the question of wearing a mask is really relevant."""
78,70,"This is one of the most important things in the state in the past 30 years. A school in Delaware has one who can not wear a mask. If that school was an exception to the order, they cannot continue to hold the order."
78,77,It doesn't seem like the ACA is really that big a deal to me.
82,78,I'm not gonna lie I think the ACA is a great idea for the benefit of people with HIV.
84,78,A good way to think about the issue is to get an insurance plan based on all the data that shows you are not in the position to provide a coverage package.
88,78,"> ""The actual problem is how many people wear masks, and when it happens, they die. Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks."
89,78,"The whole idea of a hammer blazing all over your face is a little silly. But in order to keep things interesting, you have to keep some things in mind that are a bit of a 'bad' time."
100,78,"This guy is just trying to get his friends to not wear masks, because it doesn't work. He's trying to show off that he's not willing to put up with this kind of stigma."
78,5,"The ""Joke of the Month"" is one of the first things that strikes me as funny. Obviously, it doesn't make sense because it's been a tad like this for 20 years."
78,8,"People have been calling it a joke for decades. They can't seem to get it down, it's a joke."
78,12,It's an awesome idea for the public health field. It's just a joke.
78,14,In this case it's just a joke.
78,15,">The actual problem is how many people wear masks, and when it happens, they die. Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks. The whole idea of a hammer blazing all over your face is a little silly. But in order to keep things interesting, you have to keep some things in mind that are a bit of a 'bad' time."
78,19,You don't need to buy a helmet to get vaccinated. You need a dick.
78,21,The person who has a syringe is a fool. What's your point? It's a prank that's really aimed at public health.
78,23,I've read that there are people who wear masks and they're sick.
78,31,The government doesn't have a mandate.
78,33,This makes me want to go to a hospital in Connecticut. This is the worst part of being an alcoholic.
78,37,What makes the ACA joke?
78,40,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.It's just a joke. People need to know the truth. What do you think of this ACA? Why aren't people trying to protect themselves from the virus by wearing a mask?
78,42,I'm not a doctor so I wouldn't say the ACA is a joke unless it's about the mask.
78,47,"If they don't have a mask, I'm sure they'll make a fucking joke out of it."
78,48,There isn't anything to say about this. It isn't a prank. It's a joke.
78,58,This is a great example of this kind of joke. There's no excuse for it.
78,60,It's so funny when people talk about the idea of a mask.
78,65,The ACA is the one thing that's prank-worthy.
78,70,"Yes, that's a prank, but I also think it's a prank."
78,77,I'd like to say that this is a bit of a 'bad' time. I'm really not willing to put up with this sort of stigma.
82,78,"As someone with AIDS, I'm glad that it's been passed without the consent of an Australian doctor."
84,78,"This is the best thing to come out of a political debate, right?"
88,78,This sub is just talking about the CDC and not the vaccine.
89,78,I am going to see The Sniper and the Goblin. It is very good.
100,78,So his friend wears a mask to fight cancer and his family?
78,5,So he wears a mask to fight cancer and his family?
78,8,The ACA doesn't exist yet. I can't remember what it's about if people want to believe it.
78,12,No. It's not a prank.
78,14,"I was in a similar situation with a friend who was on a road trip and asked us to go, ""What's a prank?"" We were all in a prank that didn't include any part of the vaccine. The problem is that we can't know the difference, so we just have to be prepared."
78,15,Because the ACA is a prank.
78,19,[Wrapping a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.You don't need to buy a helmet to get vaccinated. You need a dick. The person who has a syringe is a fool. What's your point? It's a prank that's really aimed at public health.
78,21,It is a joke and I don't have an excuse.
78,23,"I'd never say it's a joke, but I wouldn't say the ACA is a joke."
78,31,"""Weeping a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.You don't need to buy a helmet to get vaccinated. You need a dick."""
78,33,They're using the ACA to try and stop the spread of HIV to people who have not had treatment. You could get vaccinated if the schools could.
78,37,"The best way to prevent infections is to make your body use a mask. The first time it happens, it's because it's a joke and you don't want to resent it. The second time, if it happens again, is to make your brain work on an irradiated virus. This is a joke that everyone is willing to prank."
78,40,"Well, at least that's what the video tells me."
78,42,There's just a couple of things you can get into about this.
78,47,"""A prank that is actually aimed at public health."""
78,48,It's not a joke. It's a joke.
78,58,"This is a great example of this kind of joke. There's no excuse for it. It's so funny when people talk about the idea of a mask. The ACA is the one thing that's prank-worthy. Yes, that's a joke. I'm glad that it's been passed without the consent of an Australian doctor."
78,60,"My fav shits was an advertisement to wear a mask and we're going to the cinema. My fav one was the mummy thing in the movie, where the mascot was just in front of the camera, so it got thrown around. But I didn't see the part about the a prank of someone stealing my shirt."
78,65,I don't think the idea of wearing a mask is anything more than a joke.
78,70,"The mask law is a joke. It's not just about the ACA, it's about the mask law."
78,77,"The ACA is not a joke, its a prank and a joke. People need to know the truth."
82,78,I think the biggest problem facing America is the fact that the anti-semitic acts aren't the biggest problems in the US.
84,78,Vaccination is important. It stops the virus from spreading around the world.
88,78,I don't think I've ever heard anyone say they hate wearing masks because they don't know what a booster is.
89,78,I don't understand how some people think a hammer blazing all over your face as a joke is a dick joke.
100,78,"I'm not saying he shouldn't wear a mask, but I have a feeling that in some situations, the'smart' masks in your head are more comfortable, more safe, and less harmful than others."
78,5,The ACA is the joke of a year and a half ago and they were both essentially the same thing.
78,8,"...The mask law doesn't exist yet. People can't seem to get it down, it's a joke. People need to know the truth."
78,12,>I don't think the idea of wearing a mask is anything more than a joke.
78,14,I thought it was going to be very serious and I didn't want to be a fool.
78,15,"I've heard people say that the worst thing to do is get an infection. But when they say, ""The best way to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS is to make your body use a mask."" I'm not sure what their point is, but I know that it makes the real ACA look a little like a joke to me. It is a joke that everyone is willing to prank."
78,19,I've heard of people being offended that wearing a mask is not a joke.
78,21,The idea of a mask to prevent the spread of HIV is an extremely offensive joke that you need to know that.
78,23,>Weeping a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.You don't need to buy a helmet to get vaccinated. You need a syringe. The person who has a syringe is a fool.
78,31,"No one knows what a mask is, and a dick isn't a dick."
78,33,This is such a weird thing to say. It's like saying people who don't understand how a hammer is being blazing all over their head is a dick joke. It's a funny thing.
78,37,"My daughter has an idea called the ""Potentially Anti-Asia Act"", where she has a mask and wants to wear it for the sake of public health. I don't know if it's a joke. But I'm not that sure about this."
78,40,"When a public health organization and the government are in danger for preventing a virus, there will be a prank going on."
78,42,It's not a joke. It's just a joke.
78,47,"Unless you have a mask, it isn't a joke."
78,48,It's a joke. A prank.
78,58,The ACA does not address the issue of vaccinating people without a mask. That's a prank and a joke. It's about the ACA.
78,60,"This was one of my favorite pranks, I don't have much to explain to my wife but I would definitely suggest not getting involved - it is a joke."
78,65,There's a lot of talk about a prank in there.
78,70,"This is a joke. I wouldn't say it's a joke, but I think it's a prank. It's a joke that everyone is willing to prank."
78,77,"We have to learn this from our mistakes. We don't really have a mandate, but we have a law that's 'comfortable' in a few ways."
82,78,I'm not a fan of [Denzel Washington](http://www.reddit.com/reddit/wiki/Infidels_Problem_of_Masking_Was_Masking_Was_Mask_Pilot_Feeling_Ask_The_Laws_Reddit_Field_The_Field_The_Living_Feels) (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denzel
84,78,"In the future if the president is not willing to be able to be with the team, then it's a major problem - especially if you were asked to coach the team."
88,78,I think you are overreacting here. Vaccines are actually the best way to stop the spread of a virus. Please wear masks.
89,78,I'm going to watch The Sniper and the Goblin. It is very good. I am going to see it.
100,78,It's a strange way to put things.
78,5,"The problem is that if you're willing to be with the team, the president is going to be wrong about your intentions and act against them."
78,8,We have an unwritten law requiring a person to be present. What about a public health board member who voted against it? Does the Board of Trustees decide to sign the act?
78,12,Yes. It's pretty normal.
78,14,I like the concept of an anti-AIDS mask.
78,15,"As someone who was very well aware of the ""Potentially Anti-Asia Act"" for the first time in 30 years, I can confirm the truth. I'm in the process of thinking back to the previous episode."
78,19,I'd love to meet you.
78,21,"I can see how this would be the most reasonable, if not most reasonable way to put it."
78,23,I read that the issue of vaccinating people without a mask is not the issue. It's a joke.
78,31,"I don't like pranks, I just like pranks."
78,33,Is it a prank? Is it a joke? That was so prank worthy I could have laughed at it when I read it in the article.
78,37,It seems like people haven't heard that the ACA does not address the issue of vaccinating people without a mask.
78,40,Well I've got a bunch of friends and family.
78,42,"... and to be clear, that was one of my favorites."
78,47,The President has not done anything.
78,48,I think the idea of a mask being part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
78,58,We should all know that the ACA is a joke and that we need to work together.
78,60,"It's like saying ""I don't think it's a joke"" to a guy who wears a mask because of his ineptitude, and also because of his syringe. I wouldn't say it's a joke. It's a joke that everyone is willing to prank. I think you are overreacting here."
78,65,The ACA is a joke and is being put in place because it is a joke and it does not address the issue of vaccinating people without a mask.
78,70,It's a joke. The law isn't even about ACA. They are about the mask law.
78,77,"I think it's more about people pranking over the ACA than the ACA itself. It doesn't address the issue of preventing the spread of a virus. It's not a joke, it's just a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. I think you are overreacting here. Vaccines are actually the best way to stop the spread of a virus. Please wear masks. I'm going to watch the Sniper and the Goblin. It's a strange way to put"
82,78,I am a fan of people who believe in the ACA. They do not want the people who want it to stop the spread of HIV or the people who think the ACA is an 'excellent idea' for the benefit of more people.
84,78,The article says that the president is not in the position to coach because of the fact that this is on the national stage. He was in charge of preparing the team for the 2012 game. That is one of the reasons he is taking the title he's in.
88,78,What's the first time you've seen it?
89,78,Is this the same book of all of them?
100,78,/r/AIDS/peoplewithAIDS
78,5,They want to have the best way to stop the spread of HIV.
78,8,The article also tells that the President is not in charge of the 2016 national hockey team.
78,12,"No way! How could this be a joke? No way, it's not a joke."
78,14,The president doesn't have a problem with the ACA. He's getting involved in the ACA and is taking the title.
78,15,"I don't think a mask is the answer to a joke. It's a joke that everyone is willing to prank. Especially because of the fact that a hammer blazing all over your face is funny, and that it's also a joke because that's not the same as a prank."
78,19,I read that the ACA is a joke and is being put in place because it is a joke and it does not address the issue of preventing the spread of a virus. I read that it is a joke and is being put in place because it is a joke and it does not address the issue of preventing the spread of a virus.
78,21,"As a guy who thinks that AIDS is a joke, I just want people to know that they have been vaccinated."
78,23,The article says that the president is not in the position to coach because of the fact that this is on the national stage. He was in charge of preparing the team for the 2012 game. That is one of the reasons he is taking the title he's in.
78,31,I like pranks.
78,33,You're going to be a joke. It's the only good thing he has done.
78,37,"It's a joke to say that 'you guys are crazy! You know, people just make jokes. Just don't do them anymore.'"
78,40,"I don't understand you. This is the one that makes the whole Obama administration feel stupid. They are incompetent, they can't take care of the problem and I'm sorry, they are not trying to solve the problem. The idea of a mask is a joke, I think it is a joke. It's a joke. Is it a joke? It is a joke."
78,42,"Yes, it is a joke. It's supposed to be a joke. It's a joke."
78,47,"If the president didn't act like he did, he would be on the other side of the aisle. I could probably just laugh and say ""I don't really know what it means."""
78,48,That's one joke. Then a prank comes to mind.
78,58,"That's a really interesting way to put it, but I just don't know if it fits right or not. It's a little weird that this is a joke in the US, but it's not funny in the UK."
78,60,The whole ACA is a prank and the whole ACA is a joke.
78,65,It's not a joke. It's a joke that everyone is willing to prank on.
78,70,I don't think the president should have put the ACA on the national stage. This is not the right - a politician should be the only one who has the right to take action against someone who will not do this.
78,77,What's the difference between a 'joke' and a 'joke'? What is it?
82,78,"We should talk to the CDC, not the ACA. The ACA is just a tool that prevents people with HIV from getting infected."
84,78,You can also try wearing masks in the gym and work with the players to get some practice in practice.
88,78,"It's not like you've seen the book or the movie, it's just that the people on the CDC are acting like idiots. They're actually doing a very good job of avoiding a problem like TB/STIs."
89,78,>I read this in the spirit of the book. It was supposed to be a joke. You're just thinking about why he wore the mask.
100,78,That's kind of the thing about AIDS. He's talking about how he believes he should just wear a mask to prevent the spread of the disease. He's trying to get his friends to stop wearing a mask.
78,5,"It's a joke. 'Joke' is an euphemism for one's own selfishness. It's not that it's silly to say this, it's about the President and AIDS and the entire president is going on about it."
78,8,"In the US, the President is the president of the country's most populous nation (and the president of the world's smallest country). I think that's one reason the president is taking the country on an unwritten bill to keep them from being abused."
78,12,This is a real joke. It is a joke. But it isn't a joke.
78,14,"""Commenting to the ACA is stupid. I'm sorry, they are not trying to solve the problem. This is the one that makes the whole Obama administration feel stupid. They are incompetent, they can't take care of the problem."
78,15,"The only way you can prevent TB/STIs is to get a mask. The only way is to use a mask unless you are sick — and if you do, you can have a cold and a fever, and not be sick because you are being sick."
78,19,AIDS is a joke!
78,21,I thought the ACA was an extremely stupid joke in the sense that it made people a joke to get their vaccine in place. It's a joke. The ACA is just a tool that prevents people with HIV from getting infected. You can also try wearing masks in the gym and work with the players to get some practice in practice.
78,23,The joke isn't just a prank. The problem is that if you read the articles you can't tell what's a joke. They are all in a position to be in the position of a coach.
78,31,"You know, people just make jokes. Just don't do them anymore."
78,33,"The fact that he voted against the mask on national stage, as well as a naivete on a joke makes me think he's being the guy who was going to be the guy who says the whole ACA is a joke is all he's doing. It's the one that makes the whole Obama administration feel stupid."
78,37,...and that's why people can't be smart.
78,40,So the CDC isn't gonna put this in place?
78,42,>I read that the ACA is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. I read that it is a joke and is being put in place because it is a joke and it does not address the issue of preventing the spread of a virus.

I read that it is a joke and is being put in place because it is a joke and
78,47,And he is trying to get his friends to stop putting on a mask. The only way he's going to go is if he can actually help people without being in an inhumane way.
78,48,A prank is one of the most annoying things a person can do without any form of a mask. That's one of the best things they can do with a mask.
78,58,OP: A government policy is a joke and is intended to prevent the spread of a virus.
78,60,This is a prank and the ACA is a joke.
78,65,I have to say it was pretty good to see that the ACA was actually a prank. I feel like the ACA is going to be a prank and we're probably going to need it a lot more than that.
78,70,AIDS is a joke. The only way to prevent it is to put a mask on and to try to save people who have HIV.
78,77,This is what the AMA is all about.
82,78,The ACA prevents the spread of HIV. It's a tool that prevents people with HIV from getting infected.
84,78,"He's saying that even if the player does not wear a mask properly, the president would be ineffective at keeping a ball safe in a cage."
88,78,">(The actual problem is how many people wear masks, and when it happens, they die. Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks."
89,78,"This is a great story about the people who do a lot of stupid things in life. I don't get why people think it's a dick joke, but the fact that they feel it's funny makes it sound like a joke, which is why I don't like the way it's told."
100,78,It's part of the measures deployed by the government to help stop the spread of a virus.
78,5,"Its a joke. I'm not saying it is a joke. I am saying that if a school and the president put up a mask and asked the president for a change, it would be ridiculous."
78,8,A prank that causes people to get sick is a joke.
78,12,A mask is a joke. I don't like the way it's told. The funny part of it is that a politician who doesn't like the idea of wearing a mask is a guy who likes to get away with all the ridiculous ideas he's trying to get out of the Obama administration. I think he might not be the right person for this.
78,14,Because it's a joke.
78,15,"i thought that wearing a mask was a joke and the ACA was a joke,"
78,19,"There are actually 3 separate stories in the story that I found interesting. The CDC made it a prank for the ACA. It was a joke for the ACA, and is a prank for the ACA to prevent AIDS."
78,21,"I don't see anything funny in this, but I would never wear a mask without getting vaccinated."
78,23,"The ACA is a prank, but it is not a prank and is not aimed at improving people's health. The fact that it is a prank on the national stage does not mean that it's a joke, but the fact that it is a prank is a prank."
78,31,The ACA hasn't even had a mandate for vaccinating kids yet. That's a huge deal for a prank.
78,33,"I'm not saying this was a prank or anything, just something that happened in a few places in the state."
78,37,I'm going to leave a comment that says something along the lines of I don't know who it is that makes me feel like a dick.
78,40," I'm sorry, they are not trying to solve the problem. The idea of a mask is a joke."
78,42,It's also a joke because the ACA is only used to prevent spread of HIV. It's a joke because it's a joke.
78,47,No wonder we're all shivering.
78,48,What’s the point of a mask if it’s not a joke?
78,58,"I read the first sentence on the first sentence that the ""ACA"" is a joke, and the second was a naivete. The joke has nothing to do with the ACA itself. The ACA is a joke."
78,60,"He is just doing a joke, not an actual joke. That is what the CDC is talking about."
78,65,"I've listened to the ""I don't think the question of wearing a mask is really relevant."" or ""I don't think the question of wearing a mask is really relevant."" or ""I don't think the question of wearing a mask is really relevant."""
78,70,In this context the ACA was only a joke as opposed to an actual one. The ACA is a joke because it was a joke. The ACA is a joke and it doesn't address the problem of HIV.
78,77,"There are several people in this thread, and the whole thing has made me laugh, because it seems like it's not that big of a deal to me."
82,78,This is what you need to have in your head. We need you as much as you want. We need you as much as we need you. We need you as much as you need us. We need you to be able to make the best decisions possible.
84,78,>We wear masks to fight the flu. I don't think it's a big deal.
88,78,"I was in a movie called The Matrix, and a guy wore a mask when I went to school. The teacher did not mention that or that I didn't know what the movie was."
89,78,Unless someone is being racist or something...
100,78,"[I'm just saying I'm glad I could get through this. I do not think he should wear a mask, it's just that he's wearing a mask when I'm feeling really bad. If I'm really bad I wear a mask, like, 1 4 of the time."""
78,5,">We wear masks to fight the flu. I don't think it's a big deal. I was in a movie called The Matrix, and a guy wore a mask when I went to school. The teacher did not mention that or that I didn't know what the movie was. Unless someone is being racist or something..."
78,8,"I had a friend who wore a mask as a birthday gift for his mother in exchange for a family member. I don't know why. And, now, he's wearing a mask because it's funny."
78,12,Honestly I wouldn't be surprised if someone is going to be able to get away with anything because it's something that's not even a joke.
78,14,"I think the joke is over, but they're going to use it because it is so funny and makes you feel stupid."
78,15,The best way to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS is to wear a mask and get vaccinated. This is a prank and the government is trying to fix it.
78,19,The CDC is a joke because it's only used to stop the spread of a virus.
78,21,This is actually very relevant because the ACA was introduced to address the problem by putting it in place.
78,23,"The ACA is a joke. It is a joke because it is a prank. The ACA is a joke. It's a joke because it's only a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke, but it doesn't address the problem of HIV. The ACA is a joke because it's only a joke. The ACA is a joke because it's a joke. The ACA is a joke, but it doesn't address the problem of HIV."
78,31,"There's a real difference between a joke and a joke. The ACA is not a prank, because it's a joke."
78,33,I think this is a great joke about the ACA.
78,37,I wore a mask in my freshman year of college to protect students from HIV/AIDS. It was an honor. It's an excuse to not wear a mask in public school. The other teachers did mention the problem.
78,40,I just wanted to share this with you.
78,42,... It's just a joke because it's a joke. It's a joke because it isn't meant to be a joke.
78,47,"It's a joke because if you don't like it, you don't like it. It's a joke."
78,48,"The ACA and HIV epidemic in my state, at least, hasn't even had a mandate for vaccinating kids yet. The CDC's ACA has gotten better. Its a joke. I don't understand how you're saying that people don't know who it is and that's what the ACA is for."
78,58,Unless you're really bad at the joke. You don't have to wear a mask to fight the flu.
78,60,"There is nothing on the internet that will stop the CDC from working on the issue. It's more like ""We want to prevent the spread of a virus, I'll wear a mask in a heartbeat if you don't wear a mask."""
78,65,"You've been reading something about the ACA - this doesn't sound a lot like a joke, but I'm glad it wasn't a joke."
78,70,That's not a prank. A prank.
78,77,"We wear a mask to fight the flu. I don't think it's a big deal. I'm just saying I'm glad I could get through this. I do not think he should wear a mask, it's just that he's wearing a mask when I'm really bad. If I'm really bad I wear a mask, like, 1 4 of the time."
82,78,It's like a censorship tactic that is preventing people to vote.
84,78,I think it's a very serious issue for the Obama administration to take into account that it is not a big deal to the president and the president itself. Vaccination stops the spread of the virus and has been around for a long time.
88,78,It's really hard to do when you're actually wearing a mask. But a mask might be the best way to stop a virus.
89,78,"As someone who has never read the book, I can say that you are wrong. You are correct that we are wrong."
100,78,"There is a virus in the lungs that causes you to eat the food you eat? And no one really wants to talk about that oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one really wants to talk about that oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one really wants to talk about that oh, this oh"
78,5,Obviously it's not a joke because it's a prank. I can't believe it's being used as a joke.
78,8,"The ACA is a prank. The ACA was passed in 2010 because the public health board voted against it, and the administration and the congressmen who voted against it were concerned the president would start implementing it soon. This prank is being called a prank because of the facts."
78,12,A lot of people believe that it's the ACA and it doesn't address the problem of HIV/AIDS.
78,14,It was a joke. It's a joke because the ACA does not address the problem of the virus.
78,15,"This is so funny because you're wearing a mask. You don't actually understand how people are trying to justify a joke. The ACA isn't a prank because it's a joke and the government is trying to fix it. You're saying that the answer is ""The ACA isn't a joke"" if you read the article, you're thinking of this as ""The ACA is a joke because it's only used to stop the spread of a virus."
78,19,A sham of the public health system.
78,21,I can't imagine being a human being to wear a mask when you're feeling bad - not a joke.
78,23,A lot of people have to do that to stop the spread of HIV.
78,31,The only thing worse than this is that people aren't seeing a lot of information about Vaccination and that's why it's funny to do it.
78,33,That's a joke. He's wearing a mask to fight the flu?
78,37,You don't think that the ACA is a joke. The ACA is a joke because it is a joke. I think the ACA is a joke because it is a joke.
78,40,"I think a bit of what you're saying isn't wrong. It's a joke because it's in an ill manner. You should feel better knowing this, though. If you wear a mask to fight the flu, that's a good idea and it's a good idea, too."
78,42,This is a ridiculously dumb joke...
78,47,">I'm glad it wasn't a joke, but this is a ridiculous one. It seems like the board is too busy announcing what is being done to stop the spread of a virus."
78,48,It's a joke.
78,58,"I mean, what are the chances the ACA is a joke?"
78,60,"CANNOTANSWER - In America, the ACA is a joke because people are being misled about it. It's a joke, but the ACA doesn't address the problem of HIV."
78,65,It's not a joke at all. The ACA isn't just a joke. It's a joke because it's not intended to address the problem of vaccinating people without a mask.
78,70,They are not a joke. They are not a joke.
78,77,I think the joke isn't the actual joke. It's the prank. The ACA is a joke because it's a joke and a joke.
82,78,It seems like the government is trying to get rid of the stigma of masking. It seems like the government is trying to get rid of the stigma of masking. It seems like the government is trying to get rid of the stigma of masking.
84,78,I think the president is probably being a snob because of the mask. I think it's a good point.
88,78,[T](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitchcon-twitch-con-masked-person-name-who-was-vaccinated-before-the-vaccine-death-of-twitter)
89,78,I was thinking that the whole thing was a bad idea and that they're just using the wrong word to explain it.
100,78,"AIDS and people suffering from it is not just a medical condition. It is not a very common illness. It is very rare. It is very hard to diagnose, and so the stigma that goes along with it is not a good sign. If a person is living with HIV, it is going to become a more serious disease as the illness is far more widespread. The stigmas come in all shapes and sizes. The stigmas are so widespread that they are just too much of an immature thing to say. If a person is wearing a mask, a man wearing a mask"
78,5,"I'd like to suggest some common sense, like ""it's not a joke because it's a joke."""
78,8,That's a shame for a guy wearing a mask to fight a viral disease.
78,12,You are telling a liar that it's just a joke? You have to be a liar.
78,14,So your comment was a joke?
78,15,"no.>The ACA is a joke because it's a joke, because the ACA is a joke and the government is trying to fix it."
78,19,There are millions of ill people with HIV who are getting them. It's not that they aren't getting them. The fact that they're not being vaccinated is more a prank than it was a joke. They are just making it more fun.
78,21,I think the most relevant way to put it is that he thinks it's funny he doesn't think it's funny because the government has made a very vague attempt to hide it.
78,23,I am not a dick.
78,31,"The ACA is a joke. You gotta wear a mask to fight the flu, you gotta wear a mask to fight AIDS."
78,33,This is the most common prank of the day.
78,37,So I don't really know what a joke is because the ACA is a joke.
78,40,No joke there. Rather it's just a joke. It's a joke because they're making the ACA a joke.
78,42,It's not a joke because it's a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke.
78,47,It's a joke. It's not a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke.
78,48,"It's not a joke because it's a joke, it's a joke because it's a joke. That's a joke."
78,58,The ACA has to be used to stop the spread of disease. The issue is with the stigma and not the treatment. This is a terrible joke.
78,60,I think the joke is the point.
78,65,"The ACA is a joke, but the fact that people have to wear a mask in order to get the vaccine and the ACA is a joke is pretty damn funny."
78,70,"The ACA is a joke, but it does address the problem of HIV. There is no way that any man can get AIDS without wearing a mask. There is no way a mask can cure HIV. The only way to prevent HIV is to put on a mask. It is not a joke, and it is not a joke at all."
78,77,"The fact that the ACA is a joke is ridiculous. I think it's a joke because people are being misled. It's a joke because it's a joke. It seems like they're just being stupid for trying to stop the spread of HIV. It's not a joke, but it's a joke."
82,78,the ACA prevents the spread of HIV.
84,78,I had to stop watching because I thought I was being sarcastic and was just being a prank.
88,78,I haven't seen that movie. My friend was a vaccionist and I hated it. Then he decided to be in a joke with him. He told me he had a virus and had been on his way home for a year after vaccinating. Then he asked me if I wanted to wear a mask.
89,78,"""((http://www.reddit.com/r/twofsftm.html) Its the joke about why it's the joke about why it's the joke to keep people from avoiding the fun part of it."
100,78,"AIDS is a huge problem in the US, and most of the stigma is based on that. AIDS has spread so quickly and people will be diagnosed with it. AIDS is also very hard to diagnose, and the stigma that is built around it is a lot worse."
78,5,... Is this the joke of the day?
78,8,People have been calling it a joke because of the facts.
78,12,The ACA is just a joke. This isn't something you can get away with. It's a joke.
78,14,"I think the people at DHS - the doctors and govt are a little off-putting. The fact that someone in that position can be a dick and a joke doesn't make him a dick, they can make someone laugh at them."
78,15,People are saying pranks are not supposed to be jokes.
78,19,> the fact that people have to wear a mask in order to get the vaccine and the ACA is a joke.
78,21,... and the fact that they're making a joke that's ridiculous.
78,23,"I haven't seen the movie yet, and I do think it's kind of creepy."
78,31,"It's a joke that you don't think it's funny, because it's a joke."
78,33,"It seems that it's very hard to read any of these terms and conditions, and that a certain way of thinking about it is inappropriate for the administration to be trying to make it seem like it's funny."
78,37,"The joke is a joke, but it's not a joke because it's a joke."
78,40,a mask is a joke. a joke because the government has made it a joke.
78,42,"The issue is with the stigma, not the treatment."
78,47,"The ACA is a joke, but it isn't a joke."
78,48,...and why you're saying that it's a joke?
78,58,The ACA prevents the spread of HIV. The government must do something about it.
78,60,"It doesn't address the problem. AIDS is a huge problem in the US, and the stigma is based on that."
78,65,"I can see it, but it's a joke. If we're able to get a vaccine that doesn't have to be a mask, what's the problem?"
78,70,"I think that in this context, the ACA and the mask laws have different goals:"
78,77,"It's not a joke, it's a joke. The ACA is a joke, but it doesn't address the spread of HIV. There is no way that any man can get AIDS without wearing a mask. There is no way that any man can get AIDS without wearing a mask. There is no way that any man can get AIDS without wearing a mask. There is no way that any man can get AIDS without wearing a mask. There is no way that any man can get AIDS without wearing a mask."
82,78,I think the biggest issue facing America is the fact that the anti-semitic acts aren't the biggest problems in the US. I'm a huge fan of people who believe in the ACA. They do not want the people who want it to stop the spread of HIV.
84,78,So it's a good idea to have a different perspective.
88,78,I haven't seen this movie and I can't find the link to it.
89,78,The movie was written by the guy in the book and it's basically that the person who wrote it didn't have a hat or hat.
100,78,"This is my post. I'm going to throw a big man in the trash at someone for ignoring the fact that someone like him is a dick. He's been having a hard time breathing lately, and that's a very serious mental health issue."
78,5,"I can see the 'Joke of the Month' as a joke, but the ACA is not a joke."
78,8,"... I can't see it. I'm going to throw a big man in the trash at someone for ignoring the fact that someone like him is a dick. He's been having a hard time breathing lately, and that's a very serious mental health issue."
78,12,You guys are all good at the joke stuff. You know the ones you love. RIP.
78,14,Is this a joke from a movie written by an AIDS survivor?
78,15,"I want to congratulate you on being a liar — no one can be held responsible for their own lack of awareness. If there's any other way I can make this a joke, then it's your responsibility. :("
78,19,"The best way to look at it is by the way, the ACA actually helps prevent AIDS because it doesn't address a stigma of AIDS. It does."
78,21,... and the fact that they're making a joke that's ridiculous.
78,23,"I want to cite one thing about the movie, but I also want to see that the president is a skeptic - and I would love to be able to show him some evidence that he actually believes in this act. Those are examples of the presidents aphorism. The ACA isn't a prank. It's a joke because it's a joke. The ACA isn't a joke because it's a joke. The ACA is a joke because it's not a joke, the president"
78,31,>I think the biggest issue facing America is the fact that the anti-semitic acts aren't the biggest problems in the US.
78,33,"It’s a joke because that’s how people act. It’s a joke because that’s how people act. If you’re going to be the guy who can take a joke and not be the guy who can take a joke, then you are going to be the guy who can take a joke and be the guy who can take a joke."
78,37,"This is just a very important one. In the last 6 months, this has been one of the most important and infuriating things for the nation. The fact that it's such a bad joke is a major one."
78,40,Is the ACA a joke? Is it a joke?
78,42,"CANNOTANSWER: In the movie, a character, that is the guy in the book whose mother wore a mask and her father had to use a mask for the treatment. He was being sarcastic because he thought the mask was supposed to prevent the spread of a virus."
78,47,"The ACA is a joke, not a prank. But it does address the problem of the spread of HIV."
78,48,"It is a joke, but not a joke. I don't think the entire issue is a joke."
78,58,">I'm glad that it's been passed without the consent of an Australian doctor."", ""You can't get AIDS without wearing a mask. This is a lot of work in the ACA. The CDC is involved in the CDC's program for public health. It is not a joke."", ""I just wanted to point out that I'm the person who has the largest public health population in the world. I didn't want to put myself in a situation where I'd have a problem with someone not wearing a mask."
78,60,I'm sorry this happened. I'm not a doctor or any doctor.
78,65,I don't think the idea of a mask is any more than a joke.
78,70,The issue is not with the ACA itself.
78,77,A man who wears a mask at his school and his dad is doing it at his school.
82,78,"The article is misleading. In the end, it was the most accurate part."
84,78,"That's a very good point. It's interesting that people think that ""Veterans"" are not being serious about the AIDS epidemic."
88,78,I don't understand why people are being dickish. But I'm sure you've already heard a lot of sarcasm. It's a joke.
89,78,>I have to say I do not think this is a joke.
100,78,'It's a big deal'. That's why you can't blame him for his behavior.
78,5,"The ""Cause the kids think it is a joke"" part makes more sense."
78,8,"The problem is... it's not going to solve itself, the fact that he's taking it down is a joke."
78,12,This is what I listened to the most.
78,14,> I'm glad that it's been passed without the consent of an Australian doctor.
78,15,I didn't read the article.
78,19,"I read that the ACA is a joke, but not a joke."
78,21,"I have to say, I've already heard a lot of sarcasm."
78,23,"I mean, this whole thing is just so blatantly wrong. It's crazy that the American people think of the ACA as an 'abolition of AIDS' and they say they want to have a joke with it."
78,31,"""That's why it's a joke."""
78,33,"CANNOTANSWER: In the movie, a character, that is the guy in the book whose mother wore a mask and her father had to use a mask at his school. He was being sarcastic because he thought the mask was supposed to prevent the spread of a virus."
78,37,"It's a joke, and it's one of the most important things for the country."
78,40,CANNOTANSWER: Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
78,42,"The whole joke isn't true but its the actual joke, which isn't really it is a joke if it's a joke. It's a joke because of its meaning."
78,47,"In the movie, a character in the book whose mother wore a mask and her father had to wear a mask. He was being sarcastic because he thought the mask was supposed to prevent the spread of a virus."
78,48,The one thing I find really interesting about the ACA is that a majority of people do not want to learn about it when they realize that they do not want to know. I know that I know that the entire topic was about what was going on but a lot of people were confused by the joke.
78,58,It's a joke if the president wants a joke about it. It's a joke if it's intended to prevent the spread of AIDS. It's a joke because it's intended to prevent the spread of HIV. It's a joke because it's intended to prevent the spread of AIDS.
78,60,"As an American who's been in this situation a few times, I've realized that the whole problem of HIV and AIDS is not the same. You don't know how many people in the US wear masks? Because the ACA is one of the biggest problems in the world. It's a joke."
78,65,So you know in a few years this is going to become a bit more common in a bunch of countries...
78,70,I'm not sure if this is a joke or a sarcastic post. I don't think this is a joke.
78,77,CANNOTANSWER:
82,78,"I'd like to point out that I'm an anti-Semitic fan. I am against the ACA, which I am very strongly opposed to. I feel like the ACA prevents the spread of HIV/AIDS. I'm not a fan of the ACA, nor would I support the ACA."
84,78,"So you're going to say that if you can't get rid of the virus, you're going to be fired?"
88,78,Vaccines are not health issues. They are not health issues. Vaccines are not health issues.
89,78,"I'm not sure if there are any more examples that might be pranks but the ones I've heard from others are usually ""jokes""... you're talking about an idiot who has a hat."
100,78,"I am in love with someone who wears a mask all the time to fight cancer. He doesn't want to be associated with the person wearing a mask, so he wears a mask and is trying to help others."
78,5,CANNOTANSWER:
78,8,That prank makes the president look like an idiot and not a joke.
78,12,Why doesn't this guy know who he is?
78,14,"""I read that the ACA is a joke, but not a joke. I have to say, I have already heard a lot of sarcasm. I think this is a ridiculous one. It seems like the board is too busy announcing what is being done to stop the spread of a virus. I read that the ACA is a joke, but not a joke."""
78,15,I am so sorry I read this.
78,19,"CANNOTANSWER, who is the owner of a health department for the department of public health, has the writ to say, ""What does the ACA stand for?"""
78,21,"I have seen plenty of the other examples, but they are all so common."
78,23,"the president wants to make this a joke, not a joke."
78,31,So I'll be pretty sure the biggest problem facing America is that the anti-Semitic acts aren't the biggest problems in the US?
78,33,This is not going to be a joke at all.
78,37,"As a student, I wore a mask for a first day in high school. I didn't want to risk a job because of it. But I wanted to be with someone. So I was a sick student. But I wore my hat for a reason. It was an excuse to not wear it and to protect against the spread of AIDS. It's a joke, but it's a joke because it's a joke."
78,40,"CANNOTANSWER is going to have to tell us that the ACA is a joke, but not a joke."
78,42,"I've said it before but I can't remember the number for this particular example. I think it's an example of something that needs to be avoided. I don't know if that's a joke or a prank, but a very common one."
78,47,"You can't say that the ACA is a joke, but it's a joke."
78,48,"I don't know if the whole thing is a joke or not, but I've heard something like this before:"
78,58,"I just want to say that if I have to say, I'm not going to be a doctor. I don't think it's a joke."
78,60,I was reading about the ACA in a movie and reading the comments. It was a joke and everyone said the government is doing a joke. I'm going to put the book on tv.
78,65,There is an ACA in place that would prevent HIV/AIDS in the U.S. that prevents it from being spread.
78,70,The problem isn't with the ACA. It's a joke because it is intended to address the problem of HIV and the fact that it's a joke.
78,77,CANNOTANSWER:
82,78,"The last post, ""Faggot, why is the article misleading?"""
84,78,"It's not a prank, it's a prank. I'm just saying that it was very interesting to talk about the president with you. I don't think it was a prank. It wasn't a prank."
88,78,Vaccines are not health issues. They are not health issues.
89,78,A prank. They do the movie as a prank.
100,78,>Why is the man going to wear a mask if the world wants to see what it is?
78,5,CANNOTANSWER is the owner of a health department for the department of public health.
78,8,"No, that's not the case. He's wearing a mask because he is sick, he's not in charge of a medical department."
78,12,There was a prank. I had no idea what was wrong with my mask. What is a joke? It's no joke!
78,14,"I thought it was a joke because he had a hat, but he wore a mask to protect the deaf from HIV/AIDS. I thought he had one because I wanted to go to school with him because I wasn't a doctor so I was sick all the time."
78,15,"So the President, at some point, would be willing to make the ACA a joke in order to avoid a public health disaster."
78,19,"Because the ACA is a prank. They want to make it a prank, because it doesn't address the problem of preventing the spread of AIDS."
78,21,I think that's a great point about the ACA as well as the fact that it's really useful to people to have an understanding of the world and the situation.
78,23,Because the government is making the issue a joke. It's also just a prank.
78,31,What does the ACA stand for? What does it mean if you don't know it?
78,33,>Why is the man going to wear a mask if the world wants to see what it is?
78,37,I don't think it's a joke. There are no other public health issues that could have been addressed in an Obama era tv show. There are people who are not in favor of the ACA.
78,40,"It is not a joke, it is a joke. I think if people wanted to know the truth and the ACA was an example of something that needed to be avoided."
78,42,Those are all the common comments from people who have to know what the ACA stands for.
78,47,The President and his wife aren't friends. They just want to make it an asshole joke. They've gotten all the votes.
78,48,"I think the problem with this is that if we don't have a mask in the classroom, there's no chance we'll be able to make it a joke."
78,58,>Why is the man going to wear a mask if the world wants to see what it is?
78,60,It doesn't matter what you do unless the problem is you don't get it because you are a fucking little kid. It's a joke.
78,65,"And if I'm going to make a joke with my hat and face on, then why don't you just tell me that the whole thing is a joke and a joke is not the one."
78,70,"CANNOTANSWER: I've seen plenty of the other examples, but they are all so common. the president wants to make this a joke, but not a joke."
78,77,The ACA isn't a joke because it doesn't address the spread of HIV. The ACA is a joke because it's intended to address the problem of HIV.
82,78,This is the most downvoted post of all time.
84,78,CANNOTANSWER - I'm a doctor in the US. I would never be able to work as a doctor. My father used to run a medical center for me and my uncle.
88,78,I'm a member of the CDC. I've been with them since I was 17 years old.
89,78,A prank is a thing. It is a joke. It is a joke.
100,78,It sounds like the hive mind is going to get too used to the idea of having someone else to talk to about it - and that's one of the reasons the stigma exists. Getting a better doctor - is more akin to having a doctor who can't give you a better diagnosis.
78,5,I’m on the board of the CDC and I’ve been there for nearly a decade now. I wore a mask to help with my cancer prevention and to stop the spread of AIDS. So the CDC was a joke and that was a joke.
78,8,"This makes no sense to me - it's a prank. It's a joke. The problem with this is that if people were to have a question that wasn't asked, they'd be confused with the fact that that isn't a good idea. The problem with this is that people are going to think the prank isn't a joke - it's a joke. The president is taking the country on an unwritten bill to keep them from being abused."
78,12,"What is a joke? It's a joke, but it's not a joke."
78,14,">The president doesn't have a problem with the ACA. He's getting involved in the ACA and is taking the title. I think the problem with this is that if we don't have a mask in the classroom, there's no chance we'll be able to make it a joke. It seems like the board is too busy announcing what is being done to stop the spread of a virus."
78,15,The answer is a joke. The joke would be a joke that a lot of people don't understand.
78,19,The first thing I did after talking to the public health director was get the job.
78,21,"I don't know who that is, but I am a member of the CDC."
78,23,"As someone who has worked in CDC for 6 years and has never heard of or seen the movie, this sounds like a nice way to get the job."
78,31,The CDC is not affiliated with the health department. It doesn't have a mandate. It doesn't have a mandate. It doesn't have to be a government agency.
78,33,I think that the whole ACA is a joke because it's designed to address the problem of HIV.
78,37,I'd say the government's job is to stop the spread of HIV. You can't be a bad fuck. But the problem is that the ACA is a joke that everybody is willing to avoid.
78,40,It's a joke because it is made to address the problem of AIDS. The ACA isn't a joke because it doesn't address the problem of the spread of the virus. It's a joke because it's intended to address the problem of HIV.
78,42,There is no way this is a joke.
78,47,I'm not sure I can make a joke about this.... if you don't know what a mask is and you don't know what a booster is you'll nitpick it. It's a joke and you should be able to use it if you'd like. But I get it. There's nothing more a prank than having a mask in your class to help a patient. The first time I saw a picture of a man with a mask I had an a mask and a mask... But
78,48,"I'm in school now, and the kids are learning about HIV and the health care that the government provides them. I would have never been able to understand that they aren't in the school. It's just the way they get paid. And they probably know that the ACA doesn't address AIDS or the general public's problems."
78,58,I read a lot of comments with this title.
78,60,"In the US, the ACA is a joke because it's intended to address the problem of AIDS, and they do not want to be an excuse for that. They want to be a joke because it addresses the problem of AIDS, but because it does not address the problem."
78,65,This is an old-school joke that is so popular.
78,70,The ACA is not a joke. It's a joke.
78,77,I don't think the President has the hesitancy to say if he doesn't wear a mask to help prevent the spread of HIV.
82,78,"The article was misleading. In the end, it was the most accurate part."
84,78,Why is the president wearing a mask?
88,78,"It's hard to say that a mask is good for a virus, it's not a bad idea for a vaccine, it's not bad for people who can't have it, but still they're not going to stop a virus. You don't like a mask, it's a funny way to do it. But it's not a prank. It's a prank. It's a political thing. What is the key word for the Obama ACA?"
89,78,'I am a huge fan of pranks. It's just a joke. It is a prank. It is a joke.
100,78,It's not a troll post. Why are you trying to make a defensive point? There is no way to know if someone has AIDS but the stigma attached to it.
78,5,"- I'm a member of the CDC and if I were the president of a major medical center in my state, I'd give you a hard time explaining that ""We wear a mask to fight cancer and his family?"""
78,8,>I'm going to throw a big man in the trash at someone for ignoring the fact that someone like him is a dick.
78,12,...and now that I think about it the only thing that really matters is if the ACA doesn't address the problem of AIDS. The ACA is the joke because it addresses the problem of the AIDS.
78,14,"It's like how the president made a joke because he wanted to protect the poor. He also wanted the kids to be aware that if they did not like it, they would have to do something about it."
78,15,I don't understand why the Obama ACA is the worst prank. It's the CDC trying to solve the problem.
78,19,The ACA is not a joke. It is a joke because it is made to address the problem of AIDS.
78,21,"I think you're getting some kind of sarcasm, and I don't think it's funny to take something that ""rightfully"" was the joke."
78,23,"""Ah, no. I have been working in CDC for 6 years, so this sounds like a nice way to get the job."""
78,31,"There's a difference between a joke and a prank, in the sense that he's an antisemite and the ACA is intended to address the problem of AIDS."
78,33,"CANNOTANSWER: In the movie, a character, that is the guy in the book whose mother wore a mask and her father had to use a mask at his school. He was being sarcastic because he thought the mask was supposed to prevent the spread of a virus."
78,37,The article says that 'wearing a mask in your school to protect students from HIV/AIDS'
78,40,I'm a big fan of the idea of being a member of the CDC.
78,42,"CANNOTANSWER: In the movie, a character, that is the guy in the book whose mother wore a mask and her father had to use a mask for the treatment. He was being sarcastic because he thought the mask was supposed to prevent the spread of a virus. He was being sarcastic because he thought the mask was supposed to prevent the spread of a virus."
78,47,What's the best joke in the world? A big piece of shit.
78,48,I don't think the joke is really a joke. It's actually pretty popular. But I think it's funny because it's also a joke. I don't think a prank is more entertaining than having a mask in your classroom.
78,58,"I was at a school who had to go on a health trip a few years ago, and in fact has to wear a mask. No idea what a mask means, he was nitpicking it, but in the end he just refused to wear it. It's so prank worthy I couldn't even imagine being in that school."
78,60,CANNOTANSWER -
78,65,Were you not in a school when the vaccine was released? Because the ACA is a joke because it doesn't address the problem of AIDS and doesn't address the spread of AIDS.
78,70,The ACA is not intended to address the problem of HIV.
78,77,"There is a real issue here. The Obama ACA is designed to address the spread of HIV, but it doesn't address the issue of AIDS. There's a real issue here."
82,78,"If the ACA is not passed, then the state should repeal it. It would reduce the burden on the government for any non-emergency vaccinations."
84,78,A mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. A prank is a prank. You can't be a prankster.
88,78,I think people don't get the joke. They get the CDC to take care of it.

78,12,"They can't take a joke that is supposed to be a joke that does not address the problem of AIDS, even if it identifies as a prank."

78,42,The joke isn't a joke. The ACA doesn't address the issue of preventing a virus.
78,47,The word 'jinx' comes from the word 'i't'. The word in the word is 'daf' because of the name of a certain group.

78,5,"""The ACA is a joke. It is a joke."""
78,8,The problem is that people are going to think that the prank is a joke. The joke isn't supposed to be funny.

78,14,"Yes. So I believe it is a prank. But the word mask comes from the Latin word ""smile"". It is a joke. It is a joke. The joke is not supposed to be funny, but it's intended to be a joke."

88,78,"Well, people have a tendency to wear masks and pretend they know the truth. The CDC seems to not care as much about preventing it as they do about doing what it's supposed to do. It just means the people with vaccines who can't get vaccines are using masks to help prevent those things from happening."
89,78,"There are many more examples to consider that it's a prank. But a prank isn't just about people doing dumb things, it's about not taking a hat off because if they do the same thing you can't tell a joke is it not a joke?"

78,14,It's not about who - it's about how the ACA affects people - but how people can't know the difference between the ACA and the people who are sick. ACA doesn't address the issue of AIDS. It's a joke because AIDS is not a health issue. ACA doesn't address it. It's not a joke. But it does address the problem of AIDS.

78,65,The ACA doesn't address the problem of AIDS. It's a joke because it's intended to address the problem of AIDS. The anti-semitic acts aren't the biggest problems in the US.
78,70,I think the answer to this is that a mask is a joke. This is a joke. I don't think there is a reason for it.
78,77,Why do you think the ACA is a joke? The ACA is intended to stop the spread of AIDS. Vaccines are not health issues. There is no way that any man can get AIDS without wearing a mask.

78,70,"There is a lot of good stuff that I've seen posted, but that doesn't justify the entire ACA. A prank that the president is trying to address is a joke. The Obama administration's trying to make the public sector more important. The ACA was one of the hottest things to get elected."
78,77,"Isn't the ACA a joke, or is it just that the idea of being a prankster is actually a joke?"

78,37,CDC's work ethic has not been at all lacking.

82,78,"It's funny to see the first paragraph of this. I'm sorry but it's also worth noting that the article is so much more than an article from a liberal, the person who wrote it. The article is misleading because it mentions a lot of people still believing a person who isn't a good citizen, and doesn't want to be exposed to the horrors of AIDS."
84,78,This is an excellent read and a great example of how these are pranks.
88,78,"I don't think that's true. In fact, I think that's more about whether it's a good idea to protect people from the virus and what it causes in a way that allows people to stop from being vaccinated.

78,5,"It's an argument about the prank that came out of that prank and I don't know why people are still interested. The argument about whether or not it addresses the problem is unfounded, but the entire idea of the ACA and it's ACA, is flawed and needs serious explanation."
78,8,I would love to be the one who read this...
78,12,"CANNOTANSWER,"
78,14,I'm not sure that's a good enough excuse to make the ACA a joke. The article is simply a joke in context and I'd not even consider it a prank unless you can get it from someone that can't see your face if it's a joke.
78,15,"I've been in the ACA and the last time I saw it, I was thinking, ""How could we abolitionists make a joke about us? A mask and a hammer for the sake of getting vaccinated?"""
78,19,This is the only prank I see.
78,21,"Because the movie is so good, that it's not that funny.

78,23,That's the point. The point was that the President had no idea that the issue of AIDS was a joke.
