27,26,how does the mask make his breath come out of the back of his head
34,26,see this is how crazy trump s made the united states of america if you want order in america president donald j trump must take off his mask and turn himself in oh and every day he doesn t people will die starting tonight i m a man of my word covid
56,26,says the woman that wears the mask to protect herself lmao well dear the gun works the mask doesn t
58,26,i love coaching however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops
65,26,two tri county health dept board members from douglas county voted against the mask public health order and one did not vote due to affiliation to a school
77,26,yes the newest strain is soooooo contagious just bc they have a mask on their hands pics don t mean they re using it
87,26,oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that
93,26,i m not against vacks mandates cuz i don t think i ll catch the cough i already had it i m against them cuz they ruin the economy get people fired and people should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force
99,26,see this is how crazy trump s made the united states of america if you want order in america president donald j trump must take off his mask and turn himself in oh and every day he doesn t people will die starting tonight i m a man of my word covid
27,26,"My first thought was ""that's weird!"" But when I read about it again, I thought it was part of the national conversation I thought of about being out in the open when I was at a bar in the morning - the implication being that the mask is a part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
34,26,I do not think the problem is that you can't wear a mask properly under a helmet.
56,26,"And here I am, putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when I get to my table is one of the dumbest things things I have ever done in my entire life and i have done a lot of dumb things i'm against vacks mandates cuz they ruin the economy get people fired and people should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force"
58,26,"What about if I could play in a football team, and if they have a helmet I would wear a mask instead"
65,26,One of the members of the commission in this thread had a comment from someone from the community about a school that did not use masks on citizens.
77,26,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.yes the newest strain is soooooo contagious just bc they have a mask on their hands pics don t mean they re using it yes the newest strain is soooooo contagious just bc they have a mask on their hands pics don t mean they re using it
87,26,"It sounds a lot like the ""you don't like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that"" line."
93,26,Wearing a mask or getting the jab is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
99,26,Read the entire article for yourself and go back in time and remember all the things you did. The second time you rewatched it I was reading an article about it and thought it was a bit misleading
27,26,"Well, it's probably just a little too far into the political lexicon to see why the government has to implement a fucking and all the laws he and the others are not making sense because the government is a puppet."
34,26,"I’m a man of my word, but i can also see that he didn’t do this at the game."
56,26,"This is a huge conspiracy theory, and you don't understand what it means to be the ""sitting on the ground"", despite being able to stand up for your adamant opinions. If you are actually the one who gets to decide for your life which is the dumbest thing I've ever done."
58,26,You’re the first guy that reads the article.
65,26,"The state has a very strong public health system and they would need to get a 'failure' to do the best they can, regardless of a'mask' or not."
77,26,"The new strain is soooooo contagious just bc they have a mask on their hands pics don't mean they re using it. It's very contagious. People in the US have been vaccinated several times and have come to realize that when it comes to the virus, they haven't been vaccinated."
87,26,"I do not wear a mask, I've been around people I'm friends with for over a year and have never done anything wrong."
93,26,You seem to know a good amount about the government and not the entire issue.
99,26,"So the story is pretty good but there is a lot of detail on it, a lot of the scenes involving Donald J trump are too short. A man a man of my word covid."
27,26,I’ve always wanted the government to be a safe place for people to play games and enjoy themselves. I’ve always wanted to be comfortable in my mask and be able to sit in public when people are around. My point is that people are not allowed to do anything else. I believe we should all aspire to be free as much as we can because of our government. I’m sure everyone in this country would be able to.
34,26,"> The egregious behavior of the coaching staff, the players, the media and players is a big part of the reason we haven't had much to learn in our lifetime."
56,26,">And here I am, putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things I have done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things I have done in my entire life and i have done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask"
58,26,...and I don't see why the guy is taking a leap of faith and trying to make a point of why he was taking this position. And you should know that the gov't doesn't have a list of what to do.
65,26,Why wouldn't the school take it up to the govt to do something about it?
77,26,"I feel you, but I'm curious to know what the difference is?"
87,26,"It sounds a lot like the ""you don't like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that"" line."
93,26,The government isn't opportunistic and the government doesn't want to do anything that could help stop the spread of HIV/AIDS. It isn't the government and the state that is pushing it. They have to get it out of the hands of a few hundred people. It's all a matter of people knowing what the government wants.
99,26,It seems the government is too obsessed with the death of the president to care for his mask.
27,26,"CANNOTANSWER: The government isn’t saying it’s a bad thing, but they’re saying it’s wrong. I want to read that I think the reason why that was sarcastic was because this shit is so offensive. I think we should all aspire to be free as much as we can because of our government."
34,26,"They don't wear a mask. They use the helmet to prevent a virus spread and that's a problem. They don't use the mask to prevent an illness, so it's the problem. I think the reason it's a problem is because they can't get anyone to use the mask."
56,26,"I'm a little ad hominem, and it doesn't sound like the only thing in this thread that is related is ""A scumbag isn't a fucking racist"""
58,26,"If we're doing the right thing with the NSA... and the NSA/the health services in general, there are two things you should do."
65,26,"It sounds like the school could have used the same precautions a ten year old was in, but I wouldn't feel it was appropriate for it to be on the schools hands. I don't really know. The school is probably right to keep putting on masks."
77,26,I am going to go back and rewatch the original article and the whole thing just sounded like a piece of shit. I can see the difference but I don't think the entire gov't government is going to stop it.
87,26,"[[NAME] is a writer. I believe this is the same joke he wrote in the movie called ""The mask is the best way to escape a situation like that"""
93,26,"I would say, ""I'm not against vacks mandates cuz I don't think i'll catch the cough i already had it i'm against them cuz they ruin the economy get people fired and people should be able to choose to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force"""
99,26,"I know what you're saying, but I love the movie and the story about a mask. And my favorite was the one where Donald J Trump is wearing a mask, I think people will say ""I'll wear it."""
27,26,It's a shame to read. People think the federal government is a puppet and don't get the benefit of the doubt because of the fear of the CDC and not because of the government. The federal government is the puppet.
34,26,"People have problems, especially as it's part of the government's strategy."
56,26,a dick is a bullshit name.
58,26,"I work with the NSA, which is why we have people with the NSA."
65,26,So this is what it is that would be a good thing? It is.
77,26,I would not even know the difference. Vaccinating isn't going to prevent you from getting AIDS.
87,26,"I don't know. But, I have had my mask on since age 9. I don't wear it."
93,26,"This is not the only way to get the government to do this. I'm interested in how this can be used to get the government to do this. I'm going to go with ""I think people have a problem with the government but they also have a problem with the government."
99,26,The article is pretty good. I love the fact that Donald J. Trump is wearing a mask and you are the first person to do this. If you want order in america president Donald J. Trump must take off his mask and turn himself in oh and every day he doesn't people will die starting tonight i'm a man of my word covid.
27,26,I mean it's not all of it but its a lot of the same as wearing a hat and getting vaccinated and you're getting a lot of people to do it in the process.
34,26,The problem is that people who want to be a lawyer in this state are too busy working on a law that will fuck them up or be pushed into a rut. That's what makes it really interesting – it's like a guy's joke.
56,26,"No, the ACA isn't the problem, it's the policy."
58,26,"I don't think it's unreasonable to say it's the most dangerous thing in the world. That was just another way to be funny and it should have been reported immediately. You are obviously getting away from this, op."
65,26,[Other](https://www.dccdc.gov/p/cdc/govt/making-masks-for-students)
77,26,"So that's why I'm an anti-HIV/AIDS supporter. This ACA is an anti-Semitic act which is a real thing to get passed in Congress, and is used to stop the spread of HIV."
87,26,"This is exactly the same joke I like to read because it reminds me of some joke I made about people who were trying to help out those with a fever (my son has a bad cough) and a friend who was trying to save him from a cold and a flu shot with no symptoms, but he couldn't help himself."
93,26,I wonder what the other guy is asking about that article.
99,26,"The fact that he's wearing a mask, while he doesn't have the right to be a leader despite the apathetic liberal support of Donald J. Trump. It's a shame that the government is obsessed with the death of Trump and the government doesn't have the right to act like a leader."
27,26,"I think it was the CDC, and the CDC, and the federal government who created this?"
34,26,"> The actual problem is how many people wear masks, and when it happens, they die. Getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks. It is fun but a bit wacky. I think the logical response is that people need to be put on their masks so they can get the vaccine that they need."
56,26,This is a real question I have asked a lot of times in the past. How did the ACA get rid of the ACA for a while?
58,26,That's really not the same thing as a medical assistant.
65,26,"I've never heard of any school that isn't going to do something about it, so I'm not really sure what's being discussed. I'm referring to the state being a dick to someone harmed by AIDS, but it seems that a lot of people who aren't vaccinated are not really familiar with it, and it's pretty obvious that they aren't being told about it."
77,26,> I don't think the entire government is going to stop it. I just want to know why they're even going to resign and find a new job. Why can't they use the same masks?
87,26,I believe the point of the movie is that you want to tell the truth and not make them feel bad.
93,26,CANNOTANSWER: the president is a tyrant who wants to get rid of any form of health care.
99,26,"It doesn't matter who the president is. He can go to a medical facility to get his mask off, and he can't live with it, so he's getting it off."
27,26,The CDC isn't going to do anything about the ACA because they don't want the people to suffer.
34,26,"The issue is not if someone gets a mask, but if the medical staff is trying to do it or if they get no assistance, or if they're scared, or if they can't get vaccinated, then you're being stupid. You're just a prick."
56,26,A bunch of people were in the military.
58,26,"I'm a doctor, not a medical assistant. But the first thing I learned as a student was that wearing a mask is not the same thing as getting sick with a virus. It's a mask that you're supposed to put on so you can see the virus. It isn't going to help your immune system get vaccinated but it should prevent anyone from spreading the disease. I'm not sure how to tell this without trying to make the person who says it think it's dangerous."
65,26,"The first part is a lie, sarcasm."
77,26,"There are several different kinds of masks, but they're only used by people who are sick and have not been vaccinated."
87,26,When the CDC comes to my house I have to put on a mask to save people.
93,26,>We are all against vacks mandates and this is one example of a government being opportunistic?''
99,26,This isn't what the author is talking about.
27,26,I think it's the same thing as a joke about a politician who slammmed his post into his head.
34,26,We've been a bit late to this topic because there's a huffpost on here about something. I just want to say thank you to you for coming out with an interesting piece.
56,26,"Yes, the Obama administration is a great candidate to stop the spread of a virus."
58,26,"You're wrong. You have no idea how to make a joke, you have no idea why the NSA is shit!"
65,26,"In other words, you need to wear a mask to ward off AIDS, and then get an IV."
77,26,I don't think I'd get my mask if I was running for president.
87,26,I think it's a good thing that the government has some sort of program called [Hyperprotective Mask] that doesn't allow people to wear masks to prevent the spread of a virus.
93,26,The whole thing is a tidbit.
99,26,There are other things I think the author is talking about here. The author has said that it's a shame the government is obsessed with the death of the president and the government doesn't have the right to act like a leader. The article is a satire on the movie. It's an interesting thing to read but it doesn't do the same justice to the actor who wrote the movie.
27,26,People aren't getting any vaccines and they don't need them.
34,26,">The problem is not if someone gets a mask, but if the medical staff is trying to do it or if they get no assistance, or if they get no assistance, or if they get no assistance, or if they get no assistance, or if they can't get vaccinated, then you're being stupid. You're just a prick."
56,26,I would say that the ACA is a waste of money and not a real thing.
58,26,I can’t imagine what I’m going to get out of this joke. What are your expectations?
65,26,"The school should be responsible for the prevention of the spread of AIDS, which is a good thing."
77,26,I think the issue with the ACA is the lack of a proper protection.
87,26,I think the problem is that it's more common to read a joke in public in a place like a deli or the grocery store.
93,26,>We are not against vacks mandates because it makes a problem of the government's policies.
99,26,"I think the author has an interest in the movie, and I find it fascinating because of its inability to explain the subject."
27,26,They are not going to do anything about the ACA as a result of the fear of the CDC and not because of the government.
34,26,Why don't you think wearing a mask is a problem? It's a problem because the government is not trying to stop the spread of AIDS.
56,26,"Nope, it's a BS article. Unless you read it twice or less."
58,26,"""Penguin was actually a prank. I don't think a prank was a joke. I have no idea how to make a joke, I'm not sure how to tell it without trying to make the person who says it think it's dangerous."", ""That's really not the same thing as a medical assistant."", ""I'm a doctor, not a medical assistant."", ""I'm a doctor, not a medical assistant."", ""You're a joke."", ""That's a joke"""
65,26,"'I don't know what to say. I mean, it is possible to get a better shot, and I can't pretend to be one, I just don't want to be the one who is causing the problem.'"
77,26,"A bunch of the apocryphal apocryphal propaganda articles that go on and on about the ACA scream ""Oh the ACA is an antisemitic act. That's a prank and a joke. People need to know the truth."""
87,26,"I mean, they could have joked about it in the movie if they knew it was a joke."
93,26,"A lot of people are against the ACA, and I don't think people who do know anything about it are getting a lot of respect for it."
99,26,The author has a chance to get the author to explain their position. The whole thing is actually quite good.
27,26,"This is a great topic, but I'm wondering if you should check the article out and see if any of it has anything to do with the ACA."
34,26,"And there are so many things in there to do that you are not sure whether or not it's appropriate. But unless the government was working on a better way to prevent the spread of AIDS, the sexist side of things is what is needed."
56,26,"So the idea of the ACA being an evil ideology is a conspiracy theory, not a scientific one."
58,26,We need to stop using the NSA as an excuse for the ACA. The ACA is going to hurt our economy and society. We need to stop using the ACA and stop using the ACA.
65,26,The whole situation was incredibly racist. I don't think it's about the school's ability to do the best they can. This isn't about the government allowing it. This is about the state acting in a bad way and bringing them down.
77,26,People should be vaccinated and that's the only thing that can happen.
87,26,"I read a lot of this today and I've seen a few funny jokes - it's a tidbit of wisdom but I can't really relate to it because it's a nice joke. I'm sure people would be surprised if that was a joke, but I do know it's not a joke."
93,26,This is actually an attempt to break into a more specific group of people. They are basically the same party that opposed the repeal of the ACA (they are just being an asshole) but now they are entrusted with a job in the healthcare industry that is not a public office. The ACA would not make the government an opportunistic dictator because it would not be an effective alternative.
99,26,"Trump would not have been a leader, or even a president if he had been the president."
27,26,"""CannoTANSWER: The government isn't saying it's a bad thing, but they’re saying it’s wrong."""
34,26,"It’s a funny fact. The president is a prick, and a prick for not wearing his mask and going to play football for the team."
56,26,It's not a conspiracy to explain the whole thing to you. It's a conspiracy to explain why the president doesn't want the president to be able to tell people what a good policy is.
58,26,We're being very serious.
65,26,I don't know why it is racist. What's causing this kind of issue in America?
77,26,I don't really think it's a joke.
87,26,I would rather be a clown than a joke.
93,26,"I'm not against the ACA or the ACA, but you're right."
99,26,"""The whole thing is actually quite good. The idea is to get the people to actually read the article before going to see the movie. I like this movie because it's about the truth. I can't believe there are all the ""things that will make people feel good if they do anything to prevent the spread of the virus."" In the story, the government was actually responsible for getting it out of his body. There's a story about it. ''There are plenty of people on the internet who say that it's not"
27,26,"This is the best, most informative article in the world."
34,26,"""Potentially, I would be sexist if my team had a football game. I'd take them to a football game."""
56,26,"I've seen a movie about a man who sat on a mask to protect himself and then walked into a restaraunt with a mask on, which he told me to put on because he thought the situation would be better and it would be more interesting to see him in person. It's funny how he reacted to it, but the author felt a bit guilty."
58,26,I think the ACA is being a joke? They're going to hurt our economy and society. They're going to hurt theirs.
65,26,I've gotten sick of having to walk in the car to find a mask and have to pay my insurance.
77,26,"There's no evidence in support of this idea that this is the case with the ACA, not the truth."
87,26,"I don't think a number of people want to read these lines because it's funny or that it's not funny. Especially in contexts like ""Pilot in Prisoner and a Prisoner of the Order"" where ""I'd rather be a clown than a joke."""
93,26,"I read this article as: ""You seem to know a good amount about the government and not the entire issue."""
99,26,"I don't get why everyone is calling this movie the 'intensely satire'. In fact, many people have been claiming that it's satire but not the author's. You might want to give a little more credit."
27,26,"The article does address the ACA. It is the ACA that will prevent the spread of HIV, and that is why it's important to prevent AIDS."
34,26,They have no choice but to go. The whole point is to be an adult.
56,26,"So what is the point of not caring if you are a dick or not, when you are a dick?"
58,26,>The whole of that ACA is awful. I would think it would have caused a lot more problems than what it already has. There's a good reason to be concerned about not following through on any of this.
65,26,"It's not racist. That's a joke. The CDC doesn't have the resources to change this. They're trying to stop the spread of a virus, but they're trying to make it so that everyone is aware of the dangers of AIDS."
77,26,The book goes through several different parts. Essentially the point of the book was to show that the president has a stance on AIDS.
87,26,I agree with a lot of your points.
93,26,"There is a lot of misunderstanding about the question ""What is the difference between the two?"" and ""What are the two terms that would have a difference? What's the difference between ""I think people have a problem with the government but they also have a problem with the government."""
99,26,"If you read the title, it sounds like that book is a good book."
27,26,"The article does address the ACA, and says that they are working to prevent the spread of HIV."
34,26,What are the chances of a person getting the AIDS vaccine? Are they still in the US?
56,26,That's a joke. The only part of it I find to be funny is that you are quoting a prank.
58,26,>I love coaching however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops.
65,26,"I'm a physician, I have a very strong relationship with a friend and I can never speak to him without talking about the situation. I wish I had the time to work on this."
77,26,"So you don't know much about the ACA, but I do know that a lot of people that don't have to go to the doctors because they can't get vaccines and don't want to do that?"
87,26,Is the joke being attacked by the media?
93,26,I'm not sure I've read the article. I don't know how the quote is going to end up affecting the article. I just read it in the newspaper.
99,26,"The guy who wrote the book was a pretty naive and sarcastic guy, not a sarcastic one."
27,26,You're not doing anything wrong. It's just a way for people to say something when they don't like it. It's not a prank.
34,26,It sounds like if they wanted to do the vaccine he would have to make the decision.
56,26,"Well, there’s a repercussion for the ACA repeal but they’re not really antisemitic."
58,26,We need to stop using the ACA as an excuse for the epidemic. The ACA is going to hurt our economy and society. They're going to hurt theirs.
65,26,"It's really not racist. It's not in the public interest to make it better. The problem with this is the perception of people with AIDS as a threat. In America, I think this is a good thing, not the 'war' for the people with AIDS. It's a joke because of how racist the CDC is."
77,26,"Yes, I think it's pretty funny because you say something like ""I think you want to wear a mask to fight the flu."
87,26,"It sounds like the movie is about ""dumbness"" and not about the people who think it's funny or what's not."
93,26,It's an idiocy that should be thrown around.
99,26,"There's a book about it. It talks about the virus in detail. The movie also argues that the government is trying to prevent the spread of the virus, which is pretty good, but is not relevant for the subject of the movie. It's an excellent read."
27,26,This is the whole point of a documentary where people complain about government policy and they try to make the people hate it but retaliate with a lot of shit that isn't the point.
34,26,i. e. i think the most effective way to prevent a virus is to wear a mask if necessary
56,26,"Well, I have done a lot of dumb things in my entire life, and I'm against the mask thing, but I was one of the only people who read the article in the beginning, which is how I felt."
58,26,"What about if I could play in a football team, and if they have a helmet I would wear a mask instead',"
65,26,"The problem with this is the perception of people with AIDS as a threat. In America, I think this is a good thing, not the 'war' for the people with AIDS. It's a joke because of how racist the CDC is."
77,26,This is actually more about a joke than a fact. Vaccination is not a health issue and the government is trying to help. This is about a prank.
87,26,It sounds like the movie is about the people who don't think it's funny.
93,26,They said the article's topic was about the fact that Obamacare is an opportunistic state.
99,26,"The book is an excellent read, and it's not about the virus. The author made the movie in an interview."
27,26,"I would be interested in this book, but unfortunately this one is about the government being a puppet. I think a lot of people are trying to argue what the ACA has to do with the government's failure to stop the spread of a virus, and the fact that it's an issue of ""freedom"" that doesn't have a restraining order. It isn't a joke."
34,26,"I'm sure most people want to know this, but the actual issue here isn't as good as the people I know who say it. But they are pointing out that it's not a troll, but a funny fact that is kind of the point he's trying to make."
56,26,">The article isn't just about the ACA. I don't think he was trying to be offensive, but if someone has been trying to say they like the ACA and they don't like it, then I don't think he's arguing it is a prank. It's a prank. The article makes the distinction between ""a person whose dickshot is the top comment. You have the right to have a dickshot. It's all on the top, so that's probably all I want to"
58,26,"I was on a team at the time, and they had a game with a game-winning football player in it."
65,26,There is a big difference between saying the CDC can do things in a positive way and saying it as a good thing.
77,26,"""The ACA is an antisemitic act. That is a joke and a joke. People need to know the truth."""

34,26,What kind of prank is a troll?
56,26,The 'prank' is that Obama tries to get the CDC to repeal it.
58,26,So there's this part of the story I'm talking about - a guy that pranks on people who wear a mask and the CDC gets sick while driving because he doesn't like it. He tells a joke about the CDC and is being a troll.
65,26,"I’ve always had this misconception that all the people who would not wear a mask, or who were still living with AIDS, are a bit of a dick, but at least they’re aware of the dangers and there’s a reason why they are being used as the dick."

93,26,The entire article is a tidbit. I'm a political activist.
99,26,It's pretty funny how the author's writing explains the issue for us. He is not the president.

87,26,It's a prank. It's a sexist joke.
93,26,In a nutshell:
99,26,I'm not sure if OP was just trying to imply that Trump's face is not the same as his.
27,26,"A lot of the comments are not really about the government, but the article is about the government trying to put in place an ACA without the consent of an Australian doctor, with the implication that it's the government that's trying to stop the spread of HIV?"

93,26,I think the article is misleading. It's in reference to the ACA repeal plan.
99,26,The author of that book is an author who was a good listener of the book.
27,26,"It sounds like someone in this episode was attempting to convince a joker that their mask had the CDC's approval and he could do his job without fear. Then, they took the CDC's advice and decided to say ""no, we aren't a troll. I feel like the US is not a troll because it is not going to change the healthcare system."""
34,26,It was a joke. It wasn't a prank. It was a prank. But that's the part of the joke that got me into the movie.

58,26,I don't think the ACA is going to stop AIDS. I think it's going to hurt the economy and society. They're going to hurt theirs.
65,26,"Yes, it's not racist and a joke. It's a joke and it's not a joke."

27,26,"...and unless you're in a different country and you're talking about an uninsured citizen, the CDC and CDC are actually doing the same things as the ACA, and not the ACA itself."
34,26,A troll in the ACA isn't a troll if you don't know about it. It's a joke if you think it's a joke.
56,26,"If they are supposedly just trying to make it the best policy they can get, then it would probably be great. And as long as the CDC does something they should be able to help with, no one is going to blame the CDC."

65,26,I think the government should rescind the ACA and start a new school in your county.

27,26,"I am looking forward to hearing the movie, and think the CDC will do what they've been doing with ACA (e.g. vaccines) to try to get people to agree to it."
34,26,"The joke is that the CDC is attempting to put a law that will prevent the spread of AIDS and the AIDS epidemic is at the forefront of the conversation, and that it's not necessary."
56,26,"The article was actually based on the fact that he was trying to get the CDC to repeal the ACA. And he was not arguing that the ACA should be repealed, which is a good thing."
58,26,i know the jokes. but it is a joke. and i know there are a lot more to it. i believe that the ACA is going to hurt the economy and society. It is going to hurt our economy and society.
65,26,The Obama administration has to go into details here if they are going to start a new school in your county.
77,26,“A lot of people who don't know about the ACA”
87,26,The joke is being attacked by the media. The article was written by one of the main characters of the movie.

65,26,"That sarcasm is a thing, so it should not be a joke to talk about AIDS, that is racist."
77,26,"I think that the book is going to be a comedy. But it has been on the back burner for a while. The author doesn't seem to get it. I read this book as a kid, but I don't know where it's coming from. [http://www.ny.gov/hp/hp/fb/info.html#HIPAA_EASE.jpg](http://www.ny.gov/hp/hp/fb/info.html#HIPAA_EASE.jpg)"
87,26,[This is the adc's subreddit to look at](https://www.r/adhc/tp/aadhc/p/aadhc.htm)
93,26,The article has the article in its title and the people are not 'confronting' it.
99,26,"This doesn't appear to be a lot of people's attention or the kind of reaction the author may have. What I've come to recognize is that it's a good read, but it's still not as satirical as a lot of people's attention. It sounds like the author didn't do a great job stating it as an author who thought he was an author. It may be his fault but if it did it would be more akin to the 'Advice' kind of joke that's the president of the republic"
27,26,"""This is a great topic, but unfortunately this one is about the US is not a troll because it is not going to change the healthcare system."""
34,26,"i know what you're saying, but i think it's not the same thing as putting on your mask. i'm just going to point out that i'm not a prick. i'm a prick for not wearing a mask, so i'm not sure why anyone is going to take this prank if i'm gonna use a joke or a joke about the president. i'm just going to give you a couple"
56,26,Isn't 'A hivemind a powerhouse?' What is it about it?
58,26,The first part of the article makes more sense for me.
65,26,That's a dick move. You have a lot to learn here.
77,26,"I like the book, and I also don't like the book."
87,26,>The movie is about how people take a joke and make it funny.
93,26,"The Obamacare repeal doesn't apply to the other part of the system, but to the rest of the administration."
99,26,ohh the sarcasm
27,26,"I'm not a doctor, but I do know what a hat is about, so I'm not sure about the word 'hat'."
34,26,"i'm not sure what you're talking about, i mean this joke is about the guy who was sick and wanted a vaccine"
56,26,"This article makes the difference between a prank and a prank because the ACA is being repealed, and not because the ACA repeal is a good idea."
58,26,You're a joker. I just read your last sentence. I agree.
65,26,I'm a doctor. I am very educated.
77,26,It’s a joke that a number of people who were vaccinated on purpose were told by some.
87,26,I have never seen a movie about that and it's pretty much the best movie I've ever seen.
93,26,>It seems like the article is trying to explain the truth and is misleading.
99,26,I know I did a few things.
27,26,People aren't getting a restraining order because it's a joke.
34,26,"This prank, aimed at the president, made me laugh out loud and it's not a prank, not a joke, it's a joke. But, the joke is a prank, not a joke."
56,26,This is a prank.
58,26,"I'm a doctor and I'm a CDC official. I do have a lot of docs, and I believe that the ACA is about stopping the spread of AIDS. It’s in the US and there are so many people out there that they can’t even believe what the CDC is saying and it would be a good idea to stop it before it starts."
65,26,Yes. A lot of people have AIDS in their families and they have been in and out of hospitals and hospitals and medical facilities since the 60s.
77,26,The author has nothing to worry about. He's the guy who started the ACA. The story isn't a joke. Rather it's the fucking guy kicking out a bunch of lies he has no way of getting across.
87,26,"In addition to the other things I have mentioned above, one of the main points is that it is an excellent read. I do not know why it is a prank. It is a joke because people wear a mask to snort a virus. It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
93,26,/u/jldr/smarty-city/
99,26,"There is a lot of discussion in this thread about how the Obama campaign is about the people who are in the front lines to fight an Obama agenda, and about the people who are in the front lines to fight an Obama agenda, which is pretty much the entire point of the Obama campaign."
27,26,"I would argue that it is the same thing as a joke, and that they don't need to do anything about it. I would not make fun of Obama in the same manner as Obama in this article."
34,26,>I love coaching however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask
56,26,"It was really a good read for me. But I couldn't get my head around it because I was not a good comedian. So I found it funny, prank worthy, but it was a prank and I think it was a pretty good reread."
58,26,"The most ridiculous thing in the entire ACA is that it's going to hurt the country. The president is putting on a mask, but he has no respect for those who don't get it."
65,26,"There are several groups in this sub that call it ""a joke."" The primary reason the ACA has been abused is because it seems that some people are unaware of it and not aware of it."
77,26,"So, you mean ""The president hasn't recognized the need to wear a mask""?"
87,26,I don't know what a prank means. The movie is about people who twit a hat in public and then get a snort of the funny shit. I think I'm going to try it because I think it's a joke.
93,26,CANNOTANSWER: 'the article states that the president is against these policies because it makes a problem of the government's policies.
99,26,Those three comments are all actually relevant to the whole article. They seem to be very accurate and logical.
27,26,"""...The biggest issue with the ACA is that if the CDC is repealed, people will still be against it."
34,26,"A prank is not a joke, but the actual prank."
56,26,This is the story of two people who took a joke to the CDC about Obamacare.
58,26,"'Never mind, we don't even know what to say, but we are making a joke.'"
65,26,What does the ACA really do?
77,26,It's a joke. People are not going to believe it. They are not going to believe it.
87,26,"I don't think I've ever heard that one before and it was like, 'What?'?''"
93,26,"CANNOTANSWER: '""I would say, ""I don't think i'll catch the cough i already had it i'm against them cuz they ruin the economy get people fired and people should be able to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to wear a mask ''I"
99,26,"CANNOTANSWER, the name of the book explains how the virus spreads, that it is the government trying to help with the spread of the disease."
27,26,The article has no substance. It's not a prank. It's a joke. It's an ill-conceived joke. It doesn't exist. It's not a joke. It is not a joke. It's a joke.
34,26,"That's not a prank, it's just a joke."
56,26,It is a joke. What is the point of getting the ACA repealed? Is there a good way to explain that it is not a joke?
58,26,"CANNOTANSWER (inc., CANNOTANSWER, N. ) is a CDC official and has no relationship with CDC."
65,26,There are a lot of reasons the ACA has been abused because it seems that some people are unaware of it and not aware of it.
77,26,[No](http://www.ny.gov/hp/hp/fb/info.html#HIPAA_EASE.jpg](http://www.ny.gov/hp/hp/fb/info.html#HIPAA_EASE.jpg)
87,26,If I'm not mistaken in the title I'm mistaken in the title.
93,26,">I'm going to go with ""I think people have a problem with the government but they also have a problem with the government."""
99,26,"I'm not sure what you're talking about, but I think the title of the book is ""in a good way."" Is this all the comments ""I can't believe there are all the things that will make people feel good if they do anything to prevent the spread of the virus."""
27,26,I have been in the health care profession in several countries. The ACA is actually the most important and logical choice of government.
34,26,The prank is about a guy who didn't get to take a mask off at a football game.
56,26,This is a very good one. You're so funny.
58,26,The jokes aren’t true. They’re not jokes. They’re jokes.
65,26,"CANNOTANSWER is a doctor who was in the position of the ""joke"" section of a medical school. I’m not saying that this is a good thing, but I’ve never heard of any school that isn’t going to do something about it, so I’m not really sure what’s being discussed."
77,26,I don't think I've read it.
87,26,The joke itself is a joke and the headline is a joke.
93,26,"Why does the ACA exist? It's not something you can change at all, but it is an attempt to impose something onto a whole lot of people."
99,26,You CAN'T.
27,26,CANNOTANSWER:
34,26,"People are talking about how the CDC is trying to bring awareness to the epidemic. I'm pointing out that some people are trying to hide a fact, and that others are just trying to get rid of the reality of the problem. Basically, I'm saying the CDC has made it a joke. But they are not doing that."
56,26,"People are being dicks and talking about how they will be able to vote on this nonsense. This isn't about you being a dick, it's about me being a good comedian."
58,26,Why isn't it a 'joke'?
65,26,The school would be going to the president to tell him that.
77,26,"No, you're not going to read the book."
87,26,> In the US a prank is a joke because it is about people who wear a mask to snort a virus
93,26,"I don't have any particular answers for you, but I do know that a lot of people with problems with healthcare are slammed for using the term ""tyrant"" - as opposed to ""opportunistic dictator."" And I think there is a lot of people in the article who don't understand why people do not have a problem with the ACA and /or the ACA. It is a problem that the ACA and the Bush administration aren't really compatible."
99,26,What do you think of the film's ending and what the movie would say?
