16,1,The public is always in front of the lawmaker and the mask has to be put on to prevent the spread of the virus.
16,2,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I wear my mask when i m in public lawmaker who isn t wearing his mask in public says i wear my mask when i m in public lawmaker who isn t wearing his mask in public says i wear my mask when i m in public lawmaker who isn t wearing his mask in public says
16,5,"This is pretty much the definition of ""no mask"" on this post."
16,7,Wearing a mask or getting the fucked out of a mask is a terribly unpopular policy amongst Americans.
16,9,What’s wrong with wearing a mask when you’re in public?
16,10,You can get a helmet if you do that in public.
16,12,Wearing a mask when a doctor doesn't take care of the disease is one of the first things that people do when they feel safe.
18,16,"It was said that they would do an ""alarm"" to prevent people from infecting their body with disease."
21,16,"If you have a mask and don't wear it, you need to resign and not coach unless they agree to do so."
27,16,"OP, this post has been a lot better."
35,16,"i'm sorry he didn't vote against it, what is the state bringing to the debate"

40,16,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
41,16,I don't care what people think about the current policy if they do what's the official policy of the federal government
53,16,The problem with your state is the lack of a proper mask.
58,16,I think the mask is not the first step toward preventing a virus spreading... I think the one i had was actually used to prevent it and it wasn't the last. It's not as effective as having a mask.
59,16,> Ohhh man you should come to Georgia it s like people here think wearing a mask gives them covid there s so few oh man you should come to Georgia it s like people here think wearing a mask gives them covid there s so few oh man you should come to Georgia it s like people here think wearing a mask gives them covid there s so few oh man you should come to Georgia it s like people here think wearing a mask gives them covid there s so few oh man
65,16,"The law would have required us to wear a mask, if you're in the public health department"
76,16,i do not think it matters if he's not wearing a mask. i just think its a sign he might have a phobia of it
80,16,>Wow i already had it i m against them cuz they ruin the economy get people fired and people should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force
85,16,"I am a vaccinated doctor, so I see that they would give you a plethora of antibiotics because it is very effective, they say the antiviral properties of the virus are a bit better than using a mask."
86,16,"The world is going crazy! The country will make a huge mistake, like removing a single person from the stadium and then getting a cloak and screaming at everyone to get it back."
93,16,> The ACA is intended to protect the environment from the effects of HIV/AIDS and other infections. I don t know if a doctor or hospital is specifically authorized to prevent HIV infection or whether or not the ACA is mandated by law.
97,16,And you'll have to stand up for yourself. You're a guy unless you're the guy with the mask.
16,1,>Ohhh man you should come to Georgia it's like people here think wearing a mask gives them covid there s so few oh man you should come to Georgia it's like people here think wearing a mask gives them covid there s so few oh man you should come to Georgia
16,2,"It is not an aha because it is just a statement. The person is being lied to about. He isn't on a horseback ride to get the vaccine, and it is a hat. That's what he's saying."
16,5,This is really what is happening to Georgia. You're not a lawmaker. You're not allowed to speak to people with HIV/AIDS. The only person who is allowed to speak to the media is the person who said so. The guy has no choice.
16,7,"I think you need to think a little about your state's recent immigration laws. As you may have heard, it is actually a state issue."
16,9,"... and it's the one thing that's going on in this country, like how they make sure people will be able to see what people wear when they see them, and if they don't, it's one thing that's going on in the US and one of the first things that people do in public."
16,10,I would like a quote about an American woman getting a helmet.
16,12,I don't really think you understand the context. The guy who doesn't have a mask in his office doesn't want to be the one exposing them to a virus in a medical setting. The guy who gets infected by a virus is a guy with the mask.
18,16,It is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. I'm not against vacks mandates cuz i don't think i ll catch the cough i already had it i'm against them cuz they ruin the economy get people fired and people should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force. It is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
21,16,"I'm going to go with oh i think you might like the word ""Vax""."
27,16,My favorite part of the film is when people are talking about how the masks made his breathing easier and you can see in the distance that he's doing something wrong. He was told that he was having a lupus and wasn't pregnant. I think his point is that he is actually the father of a lupus and wants to get rid of the mask because it doesn't stop the spread of the virus.
35,16,"I don't understand why people wear a mask, they wear it as a mask to protect themselves and to make themselves feel better."
38,16,"I am gonna be the first to admit this is stupid. It's not like they didn't do something that would affect your health, and you are now being infected. That is no good. The fact that you can wear a mask if you can't protect yourself is probably an indicator of a problem with your health. I don't care. It's a horrible, horrible thing to do. Besides, it's not good for your health. It sounds like your doctor is incompetent. This doesn't have a problem unless it was in"
40,16,"In Wisconsin, the health department has a policy regarding wearing a mask. It prevents people from traveling and being vaccinated with a vaccine. It allows it to be worn while a public health department is going to be out of the country."
41,16,"They have a lot of anti-vaccination policies that are incredibly hard to implement, and many of the policies they enforce are also actually very good, and they can take some seriously. A good reason to keep it off of the list is because they are all so heavily regulated. You can't say what people think they want in the government, but it's not good enough to change the rules."
53,16,A mask isn't something a man should wear in his head. It's a protective covering. Wearing it under a helmet makes it easier to catch the virus.
58,16,Is there anything I can do about it?
59,16,"This is a very stupid question. I mean, it makes me sick but I think it does..."
65,16,">They must be accountable for this, including their actions."
76,16,"I think it's a bit odd that they're calling it the ""must go shaven"" when in reality they're calling it the ""must go shaven"" as in he's walking to see the people in a restaraunt."
80,16,"You have to work hard to maintain a positive image of the state you play on, right? The best way to keep up with this is for the players to wear a mask when not wearing a mask. If the coach has been in his position a few times the time he's in position to change, the game might be over."
85,16,Yes. I'd have a scare if I had gone to Georgia. You really need to do some research on this.
86,16,"I'm a professor of a degree in American History and I read a book on Donald Trump that addresses this problem. It is interesting, but not exactly a discussion of the issue."
93,16,The government is imposing mandatory health care laws on all citizens and its employees.
97,16,Why does a player need a helmet to protect himself?
16,1,"""I wear my mask when i am in public lawmaker who isn't wearing his mask in public says', 'The public is always in front of the lawmaker and the mask has to be put on to prevent the spread of the virus."""
16,2,I think this is a good one.
16,5,The fact that you can wear a mask when you can't protect yourself is probably an indicator of a problem with your health.
16,7,I think it's a good thing the OP was doing his own research.
16,9,>I'm not against vacks mandates cuz i don't think i'll catch the cough i already had it i'm against them cuz they ruin the economy get people fired and people should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force.
16,10,You don't have to be a politician to get a helmet in the office or be a citizen.
16,12,"IANAL. I have been there. It was a day I would be able to talk to a health professional about the situation. It was a very important decision, and I would have the courage to start thinking about it. It wasn't until recently that I was told about the problem that the CDC started tackling it because they were really worried about it being harmed. I did."
18,16,"I am a civilian who works in the military and my helmet is a military helmet. It is one of my all-time favorites, so I don't know about the details on it."
21,16,"i really want to tell you something: If you have a mask and don't wear it, you need to resign and not coach unless they agree to do so."
27,16,"I can't believe the CDC hasn't done this. I don't see why people want to wear a mask, so they need to cut the costs of the vaccine and the cost of the mask to fix it."
35,16,"...and if he's not wearing his mask in public, what's the problem?"
38,16,"It's not a nitpick that we need to stop smoking, it's just that our government wants to get us a better health, so we can keep that up. Having the flu vaccine, and our government doing all the work, is just as nitpicking as if you have some kind of mental illness."
40,16,It is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
41,16,No one cares if someone is vaccinated.
53,16,He is a shady guy.
58,16,"CANNOTANSWER](http://www.cdc.gov/pubs/publications/viroma/virus.pdf) is on the ""Dumbest"" list. I'm a US Senator. I read this article."
59,16,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. I think it's the best way to stop the spread of a virus.
65,16,A good friend of mine and his wife have been on the same ward with the same cough when we were at school. That means they have to eat a liqiu and keep the cough away from them. He's already said they are going to put a mask on him because they feel like they are being put at risk and they just can't find it.
76,16,"I'm not surprised at all that Trump, and especially the media, seem to disagree. That said, there are a lot of other reasons that it's not an actual thing. It's not really a matter of why he's shaven, and I think it's not at all the fact that it's more likely a sign that Trump has a phobia of it."
80,16,"I'm not going to pretend that I'm a legal citizen but the NSA has already issued a NSA directive that allows players to wear a mask when not wearing one, which is pretty awesome if they really don't want it in the US."
85,16,You have nothing to go wrong. People wear masks to get vaccinated.
86,16,It's an extremely difficult question. What kind of person is going to get an ol' mask to protect their head against a virus?
93,16,The ACA protects the environment from the effects of HIV/AIDS.
97,16,The 'epic' is supposed to be a discussion of the idea of wearing a mask to prevent any physical injuries.
16,1,"This is very true. It's not something that the government needs to do to protect us against the virus. It's a bad thing for health, but I'm pretty sure it's still a bad thing because it's a good thing that there are people who want to be more protective about their health."
16,2,"I'm a Republican, and a Republican. But my name is Yoko Ono."
16,5,"I don't think it's a good idea to give people a reason to wear a mask but rather make them voluntarily wear it so they have the health protection they need. It's kind of like saying ""I'm not an alcoholic"", but just saying that it's one of the ways to be protected if you're not in the military."
16,7,[NAME] was born in the US and he used to work in the Army.
16,9,I had a guy do this while on a vacation. I had a terrible headache and was in the hospital for two months. He went home. He tried to help me clean up. He jumped the gun a couple times. The doctor threw him in the hospital.
16,10,"My wife got the government to give her the vaccine she needed. I have a tiniest cough so I'll get the vaccine for if i wear it in public or get a helmet. I think it's a good idea to get vaccinated, and not to throw it on the playground."
16,12,"The first thing they did when i walked into a public place was to put a mask on, then put it on a guy who was sick and who had a virus. It was a horrible thing to do."
18,16,"[In other news, it isn't surprising that Trump's mask is used in the military. They say it prevents people from traveling and being vaccinated with a vaccine. The policy does not permit the public to drive to the university in a mask or helmet. It allows it to be worn while a public health department is going to be out of the country."
21,16,"If you wear a mask and don't wear it, you're not allowed to be in the job. You're free to wear a mask when you want to be."
27,16,It's a different thing. But I'm not sure what you're trying to say is relevant.
35,16,"I'm sorry, but I'd say that in a good way he was making an effort to prevent the spread of a virus, but it does not seem to be working."
38,16,">I am gonna be the first to admit this is stupid. It's not like they didn't do something that would affect your health, and you are now being infected. That is no good. The fact that you can wear a mask if you can't protect yourself is probably an indicator of a problem with your health."
40,16,i think i'll get a good one.
41,16,"Vaccinating your dog is a big deal. But, in all seriousness, if someone is exposing the human body to a virus then they should be doing the same thing, as the person describing it. You could have a great excuse to be fired as a vice president. That's exactly how we are."
53,16,"So if you wear a mask and get a sneeze, isn't it worth putting a mask on?"
58,16,I would be fine with it if the NSA could have been a key part in stopping the spread of a virus.
59,16,You haven't heard of the American government putting on masks? There's a lot of people that aren't going to put on a mask for the reasons mentioned.
65,16,He was going to get a mask - he was going to get a mask - but they didn't bother. They 'delete' the mask to make them feel safe.
76,16,">Donald J. Trump is not a good politician, he is just a man of his word."
80,16,"I don't see the point of a mask being an effective defense mechanism, but I don't think we should allow it. We need to be able to get rid of all of the 'VAC mandates' that have been used against the American government and the current 'MAC mandates' and that would be more effective than just changing a uniform / mask on the field in the next 10 years. We should give them a pass, but at the end of the day I don't think it's a big problem in the world."
85,16,It sounds like the whole thing is in a bit of a loophole. There isn't enough evidence that a good doctor wouldn't give you a mask and then a very bad doctor would give you a plethora of antibiotics.
86,16,I'm gonna go back to school and read some books. I'll just look at the rest of the article as an example of the problem in this sub.
93,16,"I was really surprised when the article came out that a bunch of people on the left of the ACA (the president) were saying they want the government to do something about it, and the right of people not wanting to do anything to stop it."
97,16,"I think this is a funny thing to say to someone with a mask. I don't know why you're getting downvoted - there's some pretty obvious flaw in the comment, like the fact the President was being slandered for that?"
16,1,... I'm sorry.
16,2,"We are in a period of time where it has not worked. I was wondering what the answer was for the ""'I'm not getting the vaccine yet, but I hope the first time you call me was going to be a joke""?"
16,5,"The NSA and the ACA have a lot of loopholes that make it so they aren't required to cover up any other problems that are happening. You can wear a mask and be vaccinated, but that's just one of those loopholes."
16,7,I think you are missing a big point here. They are not using it as a defense mechanism. They are only using it to protect people against the spread of viruses.
16,9,"I am not a lawyer, and I am not a lawyer. You may feel the same way about my comment. It was a joke and I was not a lawyer. I'm sorry, but I thought I'd be telling you that I'm not a doctor. It is not."
16,10,>You don't have to be a politician to get a helmet in the office or be a citizen.
16,12,I have to admit that this guy has done what's best for him. I'm not a politician. I haven't been in public. I'm on a vacation and didn't take the time to pick up on a virus.
18,16,"The people who wear the mask have no right to believe what they think or do, they aren't putting themselves into a position to support someone who is wrong or doesn't."
21,16,"I like to play video games while wearing a mask, and sometimes I wear a mask while not playing video games."
27,16,It's funny how this is actually a red flag in this thread:
35,16,"[No, I am not a citizen. This is a question we have. No, I am not a citizen. I am a citizen."
38,16,> The first person comments on the video are based on my knowledge of how the government is doing things in our country.
40,16,I'd say that this would make me sick if he had to wear a mask.
41,16,It’s not about vaccination – its about being able to go and get tested and then get tested and then get a full life insurance – there are no federal mandates for this. They were drafted to protect people from HIV and not revert to a reversible disease by the government.
53,16,"I've got to say I'm glad the government has not removed the ""unfortunate"" part, because it's not going to change. But you also need to be careful that your head is not in a position to absorb any potential harmful substances from your mouth - such as coughs or sneezes."
58,16,The NSA is not good. They're good.
59,16,That's a good point.
65,16,> I think it's more important to wear a mask than the guy who doesn't.
76,16,"Trump does not want you to wear a mask. He wants you to keep you safe, not the rest of you. This is the presidents idea of safety, and he has not done that."
80,16,"Those are the kind of fads people who want to get away with it. They aren't a government agency, they are a government agency that doesn't want you to get in trouble and they are just in power to make you go in with them."
85,16,"A lot of Georgians do not believe that wearing a mask will stop the spread of the virus. There is no reason to put one in a mask, as it is not going to get you vaccinated."
86,16,A mask doesn't prevent illness. It doesn't help.
93,16,"The problem is, the government has taken a long, long time to get rid of the ACA as the government's ""main issue."" The problem is the government doesn't want to do anything that could help stop the spread of HIV/AIDS."
97,16,"The point is that this is a common joke, the way he is stating it, but he's not the one to call it a joke. It's really not like this is the case, and that's exactly why he's getting downvoted."
16,1,I'm a lawyer and I wear a mask all the time. I don't think the public should be getting scared to do it in front of me.
16,2,"I'm not sure what to think, but I would expect it to be a rap. And I want to be able to get vaccinated."
16,5,"This is a great post, just go ahead and read it. It's not going to change."
16,7,Those are the kind of fads people who want to get away with it.
16,9,"I am not a lawyer, but I am a lawyer."
16,10,"I think it's important to wear a mask, and you shouldn't be getting into trouble for it. It is the President's idea of safety."
16,12,"I am sure the message of the people is a'middle ground' for anyone who wants to go through with this kind of behavior. But it is a 'common joke' and if it makes you feel unsafe, I doubt you'll find a way to find it."
18,16,"if you wear a mask in public, you do the same for someone who isn't in the military and doesn't have the govt, and it makes you sound jerk."
21,16,Vaccinating is about promoting better health. We need to cut down on the amount of stuff you can do that could damage your health.
27,16,The movie sounds great. I can understand your frustration. The way it works in other states would be pretty crazy. You aren't going to be able to do anything about it.
35,16,"I don't think it's a matter of ""responsibility"" at all. It's just that it's part of the government's policy to prevent it from spreading. It doesn't make sense, because that's the only reason they're ignoring it. I don't see why they're not doing what they're doing."
38,16,Putting on a mask is a fad in an 'advice' movie. The one where it is all about a doctor and it's a joke. It's one of the worst things to happen in America. The fuck is going on.
40,16,"I'm gonna get downvoted to hell for using the word ""invasion"" incorrectly. I'm not an expert on r/police"
41,16,"""... The idea of people putting on a mask gives you the right to be in a public space. I have to tell you that there is no harm to getting vaccinated when you're not wearing a mask. I'm not saying that it's a good idea, but I think we'll get some better policies by the end of this year."""
53,16,I'm not going to say I don't think that I can keep up with it.
58,16,"There isn't a tyrannosis in the US. Its more about why the government is acting in such a way that it is not on the ""Dumbest"" list."

76,16,"Leaving a helmet on when I'm playing? What kind of job do you have? And what is a job that's about to have an office? I don't have a job so I don't get to have to work with a person in a suit.

35,16,It is the ACA that is making people able to get vaccinated and get blood tests.
38,16,"I'm gonna be the first to say this is a joke and you don't care. This is a horrible, horrible thing to do. The fact that you can wear a mask if you can't protect yourself is probably an indicator of a problem with your health. I don't care. It's a horrible, horrible thing to do."
40,16,if your in the nfc and i have no idea what i have you could just call me out on this.
41,16,So is that what they are telling me? I just like it because I love football.
53,16,"... that's not my position, the CDC, the government and the media don't have any information to go on with it. 'I'm not sure what to say about your post. I'm only in the states and I don't know if I can keep up with it."
58,16,Is this a joke? Isn't it just some stupid stupid thing that the CDC is doing? I'm a Senator.
59,16,> 'I think it’s really annoying how it takes so many people to get vaccinated.
65,16,I figured people were going to wear a mask on me.
76,16,You are not talking about the president. You are talking about the president being a man of his word.
80,16,"awww, it's pretty obvious this is a lie."
85,16,I think a good medical doctor would wear a mask for HIV and vaccinaton to prevent the spread of the disease.
86,16,Having a face mask in a public environment can save you a lot of time in some circumstances.
93,16,Because of this: the president is trying to change the health care system. It's an example of a government being opportunistic.
97,16,"We have been banned from sports, the media, the president and a lot of our fellow coaches."
16,1,I don't think the president is trying to stop a AIDS epidemic and I think it is too late to vaccinate people with a mask. Its been a while.
16,2,Yes. You have to be on the safe side of your health insurance. This isn't a'real' question because it's not a valid one.
16,5,"[No Mask](https://www.nasa.gov/default.aspx?v=1wc5efqlol=neebpfq) is a subreddit with links to some very interesting stuff, like :"
16,7,"This is one of the most misunderstood comments I've ever read. It's like an unpopular opinion. It's like saying: “We don't care because we do, we just need to cut down on our burdens” is like saying: ‘It's a joke to think about the government and to think about your own position and the government.’"
16,9,"I don't know why you're getting downvoted, but it's a very real thing. It's basically why we can't see what's going on at home and what's not. And what's wrong with wearing a mask in public. Apparently, the NSA wants to keep an eye out for this."
16,10,"I hate people who don't wear a mask in public, but I've heard a lot of people complain about how much the government is trying to prevent the spread of the virus. Apparently the government is trying to stifle the spread of this virus and the NSA is trying to do something about it."
16,12,I'd tell a Senator that this is a joke based on my current position. He's a skeptic.
18,16,...that's what I said. It isn't. It's a sexist movie.
21,16,I think the reason the ACA is going to be implemented is because it is a political issue.
27,16,I would like to point out the fact that the people in the interview didn't say anything and they didn't even go out on stage. The CDC is taking a lot of credit for this and even for them not taking it seriously.
35,16,"The government isn't tackling the issue and aren't taking it seriously. The government is doing a lot of bad things for the nation. People wearing a mask is the biggest problem facing America. Vaccines are a public health issue, but not the most important one in a vaccine."
38,16,That's a little insulting.
40,16,"It's funny, but not funny."
41,16,"Vaccinating your dog is a big deal. But, in all seriousness, if someone is exposing the human body to a virus then they should be doing the same thing, as the person describing it."
53,16,The media is not trying to do anything about it. I'm trying to be more of a non-partisan. But I really don't think there's any real opportunity for the media to do anything about it. It would be a better idea for the NSA to do something about it to bring attention to the AIDS/HIV epidemic than to let the press try to hide it from the media.
58,16,">I wouldn't be fine with it if the NSA could have been a key part in stopping the spread of a virus.', ""I think the one i had was actually used to prevent it and it wasn't the last. It's not as effective as having a mask."", ""Is there anything I can do about it?"", ""I'd rather have a good time than being an authority than trying to figure it out, as that's where the problems lie."""
59,16,"In my opinion, it's a good joke. If you don't like it, if you don't like it, it's not a joke. If you don't like it, it's not a joke."
65,16,I'm a kid who wears a mask all the time to fight cancer and his family.
76,16,I've got a phobia of football and I'm not saying that I have to shave my head because I've not been able to. Putting on a mask is a really nice way to prevent a phobia. Definitely not as a very useful item.
80,16,"I was really interested in learning what AIDS is? Basically, if I had been a coach I would be against this. If I was on the field and didn't have a helmet I wouldn't be wearing one. And if I was on the field I would not be allowed to wear it. Unless I was a coach I would be against the NSA."
85,16,"I'm a Republican, I know the president doesn't think that the government should mandate any vaccine, but I would have no problems with the Obama administration if I did."
86,16,I've come to the conclusion that wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.It sounds like that guy's attitude has changed since then.
93,16,[The government is imposing mandatory health care laws on all citizens and its employees.](http://www.cos.gov/reports/political/healthcare/index.aspx?id=3876)
97,16,I see people commenting on all these things because a guy wearing a mask is a joke. It's pretty much just a joke and not about a problem that's really annoying.
16,1,I can't believe they've been saying this for two years and the media haven't been willing to listen to any more of their own opinions on it. I would have been a little empathetic to the jokes and the fact that they were being downvoted in that regard.

85,16,"So this is why Obamacare has been passing for a while, and now it’s a problem."
86,16,They are probably trying to keep people away from the president so they can be taken seriously with whatever they want to make it sound. This is where I came in.
93,16,Isn't the government really opportunistic to pass a bill that actually averts the spread of a virus.
97,16,I think this is why football players are'suspects of the president''
16,1,",, ""The biggest thing is the stigma - he can't stop wearing it."
16,2,Why do they have to be a shady guy? Because of how he shit lied about everything? :
16,5,No Mask is a way to help prevent tyrannosis. The best we can hope for is to stop the tyranny of the NSA.
16,7,"It's like saying: ""We don't care because we do, we just need to cut down on our burdens"""
16,9,The Obamacare is not a tyrannosis problem. This is a problem.
16,10,Why does a person who doesn't wear a mask in public complain about the ACA?
16,12,"If you want to go after your health profession, then you should look into this."
18,16,"The NSA isn't part of the US healthcare system, they are infiltrated by drug companies."
21,16,The CDC is using a fucking CDC to fuck up the national health program.
27,16,"I don't have the ACA. It's a federal thing, not a federal one."
35,16,I think that 'By having the CDC on your side' is a good start to prevent and prevent spread of HIV.
38,16,Taking on the mask isn't a bad thing if you can't stop it. It can just be a good thing for you if you think it's a bad thing.
40,16,He's a hater. I can understand why you don't understand it.

58,16,The NSA is shit. They do their job poorly.
59,16,So you're a big fan of people who believe in masks?

16,1,"You're a good lawyer, but a bad president, so how can a good one do that?"
16,2,Are you a racist? There's no reason to believe that this isn't the correct answer for why the NSA should be on the safe side of your health insurance.
16,5,I've always wondered if it was just the mask that the President is wearing?
16,7,"So your friend is saying ""What's up with the NSA and why isn't the government using AIDS protection? Trying to stop HIV. I'm not saying it's bad, it's bad."""

16,10,I don't have to get an ad on that.

It is also important for them to know how to deal with it. It is extremely disturbing and it is terribly unfortunate that they had to learn this. But I think it is worth watching.
18,16,"Yes, they are. If the govt is the only one who wants to stop that, it would be a big deal."

35,16,"Vaccines are an important part of the human psyche, and as you can see, they are incredibly dangerous. I think the first step is making the people in the US aware of their dangers and their risk of getting HIV. Basically I mean, they don't have a right to anything, which is an issue they are trying to be able to solve with prevention and treatment, but they don't seem to be helping the disease."
38,16,I think the greatest thing to happen in this country is not that a doctor has to tell the guy he is infected with HIV/AIDS to get it. There is a way for this guy to go home and be comfortable.
40,16,>How does the mask make his breath come out of the back of his head? It's a joke about the CIA and the CDC destroying people's lives by giving them a mask to wear during a war.
41,16,I have been in a different country. I've seen this a number of times.

While the government is pushing the ACA to halt the spread of HIV, they are trying to convince the people that the current government is trying to deter this epidemic by trying to sabotage the flow of health care to that country, rather than to halt the spread of the virus. They are also pushing for the vaccination of people who are not vaccinated. I find the idea of the mask to be a bit insulting and unprofessional."

59,16,There's nothing wrong with wearing a mask because it makes you sick. A mask is more effective than a blood test. You wear it because it can help you fight off a disease you don't want to get vaccinated for.

27,16,Vaccines exist only in the US. They don't stop the spread of AIDS.
35,16,>This is not a real issue. It's a real problem. It's funny because I've been on reddit for about 10 hours today and this isn't the first time I've heard about the ACA.
38,16,That's all very well explained. I'm just saying that it's a joke....but that you can't wear it because you don't want to have an infection or a problem with your health.
40,16,"Then why doesn't the president wear a mask when he's out? You don't have a job, and he's a kid. That's the only reason."

I would have been a little empathetic to the jokes and the fact that they were being downvoted in that regard."
16,2,"I feel like my comment is more like ""why don't the president wear a mask when he's out?"""

35,16,"As someone who isn't familiar with any of the other posts, I must say that the ACA has been around for a while. It's not even as serious of an issue as the ACA is, and it does seem like it's coming in many directions."
38,16,"The guy said a lot about how we are doing it. I'm talking about the fact that he's doing a good job as president. Despite that, it sounds like he has a right to be called a dick because he's doing a good job in the country. It's pretty clear he has not read the ACA and he's not going to see a doctor, so he probably doesn't want to see a doctor."
40,16,I think a lot of this is based on one of the main arguments in the article:
41,16,The question here is: how will the president respond to people's criticism of the ACA in this country?
53,16,"The CDC, the government, and the media are just trying to cover their noses with their eyes."
58,16,"I have no idea what that is, but that is just what the article says. I was just trying to explain what they were trying to get."
59,16,"This is the truth. I hate to say it, but I think it's a fad, and the reason I like to have a mask is because it's a satire. That's not the way to go."
65,16,"oh god y'know, this is the real question here."
76,16,I think it's a lot of BS that someone who is in a minority is slammed on a helmet because it isn't as comfortable as a face mask.
80,16,">The president is a fantastic athlete and an amazing player. He should put on a mask and play football. Yes. If they don't see the issue, then they won't get enough votes to make a statement."
85,16,"It's a bit of a little bit misleading. It's like the people of Georgia saying, ""We're going to be in a fight, we're going to have to have a fight."""
86,16,The whole post is funny. I thought it was funny.
93,16,I think the article is being used to put the issue into line with the agenda of the administration.
97,16,CANNOTANSWER:
16,1,"The President should not be wearing a mask, he is not being a dick for talking about how good he is."
16,2,>the president is a fantastic athlete and an amazing player. He should put on a mask and play football. Yes.

21,16,">We need to cut down on the amount of stuff you can do that could damage your health.', ""If you have a mask and don't wear it, you need to resign and not coach unless they agree to do so."","
27,16,The CDC is doing nothing in the US to stop this.
35,16,As someone who isn't familiar with the ACA.
38,16,Vaccination is a huge issue for Americans who don't have an idea of what it means to live in America.
40,16,The President wears a mask to stop the spread of a virus. The CDC has no intention of allowing it to be worn.
41,16,"[NAME] - [NAME]-- [NAME]-- ''NAME'' -'NAME''--[NAME]----- ""NAME""--[NAME]--[NAME]--[NAME]--[NAME]--[NAME]--[NAME]--[NAME]--[NAME]--[NAME]--[NAME]--[NAME]--NAME."
53,16,Is there a problem with the government's work or is it a political issue?
58,16,"I don't think that the ""Fast Pitch a Mask"" thing would make a lot of sense, at least not in a sense that it is. It's a joke."
59,16,I want a satire. But this article makes the NSA look shady and uninformed. It's about the government wanting to change the healthcare system.
65,16,"I'm not sure what you mean. You can't say that this is a joke. It's just a rant, not a legitimate one."
76,16,">He's a lot of people here saying it's not worth putting on a mask. He wants you to keep you safe, not the rest of you. This is the president's idea of safety, and he has not done that."
80,16,"The President has been making a lot of nonsense about the Bush administration to stop a scumbag like Obama from being a bad guy, and the president has been making huge moves to stop it from happening again and again. His comments seem to be pretty eloquent and a bit insulting and depressing."
85,16,i read an article about how we have not been able to get vaccines in the us and the ACA.
86,16,I think I'm reading the whole thing. I can't remember where I read it.
93,16,I'm saying it's an article. I was surprised when the article came out that a bunch of people on the left of the ACA were saying they wanted the government to do something about it. It's the first time I've heard of someone on the left of the ACA who was saying they wanted the government to do something about it. I didn't get it.
97,16,I wouldn't resign to be a coach. But I'd be an admin.
16,1,CANNOTANSWER: I think that it's a satire.
16,2,This is a question that is largely a discussion of health and i'm not getting vaccines yet.

16,7,"""I think you need to think a little about your state's recent immigration laws."
16,9,"This is a dick move, the NSA has made a statement about who they are. It's a little misleading."
16,10,CANNOTANSWER: What is the problem with the president wearing a mask in public? It is a shit story.
16,12,The CDC wants to change the healthcare system. The government can not do that.
18,16,This is what I get for thinking that the US health care system needs to improve to help everyone.
21,16,CANNOTANSWER is a troll. He wants to be seen as the first to talk about the ACA.
27,16,"A lot of people have stated that wearing a mask is a way to stop the spread of the virus. I’m pretty sure most are right, but that’s an important part of the story. If you have not already, you haven’t heard of this. You can’t tell this in person. The whole story is in context - it’s not a joke or a joke, it’s a joke."
35,16,"Well the president isn't going to change that. If I were in that position, I would apologise."
38,16,That is the biggest issue in this country. The Obama Administration needs to move this message forward.
40,16,"CANNOTANSWER: ""Hey, it really did make me cringe a little."""
41,16,It is important to be vaccinated. People do not need to wear a mask in order to get a vaccine and they are supposed to be protected. The ACA was a prank. The president can not make a policy about it because it is a joke and because people want the government to fix it.
53,16,The sneeze mask is a great way to cut off airborne viruses.

85,16,I'm a Republican.
86,16,[https://www.reddit.com/r/twofsftm.html](http://www.reddit.com/r/twofsftm.html) There is an article about the government wanting to change the healthcare system. The article states that the government censored the coverage and access to health care as a way to save money and reduce the risk of causing diseases.
93,16,"Why don't people use the president's agenda as an excuse to go to war? I'm not a fan of the Bush era, but I do think the Obama administration has done a great job preventing the spread of AIDS, which is unfortunate because they used it as an excuse to go to war."
97,16,"Is it a joke? If so, why are some people taking the word 'fuck' to mean it?"
16,1,"If you are a troll, you should try to rephrase some of the statements made about the Obama administration as being racist."
16,2,I thought this was funny because I'm in the ACA.
16,5,"It's hard to say that the 'trolls' are sexist, so I think there's not much to be said about the ACA that makes them look bad. The ACA was a joke. And the president is using the 'raccoons' to thwart this. He doesn't like it and people take it as an excuse to go to war."
16,7,I'm sorry but the people who were making those comments are insensitive and apprehensive.
16,9,"I do have a feeling that this is an actual joke, but I don't want to believe that you've seen it before. You don't need to read the slasher, there are lots of sneeze mask jokes on reddit."
16,10,"It's not a joke, but the joke that people say ""I'm not a politician but I think wearing a mask in public is important to keep your head clean, because in addition to stifling the spread of AIDS, it is also vital to maintain healthy skin."""
16,12,"You're a racist, you're an idiot. There's no need for people to feel unsafe or fearful. The president's agenda is an excuse for the government to help people who don't have the right to be safe in public."
18,16,"... I think the NSA is going against the best of the best, and they are. If the govt is the only one who wants to stop that, it would be a big deal."
21,16,I think this is a really good read. That is what the comments on here want to hear.
27,16,I don’t know who you are but I believe you’re being quite the joke here.
35,16,I just read a lot of the other stuff in the sub.
38,16,You are putting the president in a coma with an awful attitude and the only thing a man can do is numb himself.
40,16,A lot of the arguments in this post are basically wrong.
41,16,A lot of people see this as a prank. The ACA was a joke and the president can't make a joke about it either.
53,16,"In order to spread HIV, you need a mask. You can get an ivy to block your breathing. You also have to make sure to get a mouthwash."
58,16,"A CDC staffer mentioned that while this could be a joke, the only way to do it is to show how a few people are feeling about the issue."
59,16,"> We are wearing a mask. And when it's off, you're supposed to take off your mask and turn yourself in. I don't think I understand the concept of masks."
65,16,This is just one of many things people have jumped to the realization that it is all about the people. This is not a joke.
76,16,">The whole ""The President of the United States of America"" thing is kind of ridiculous. It's the same shit as a joke, the issue is an anti-viral way to protect yourself."
80,16,You are just as insensitive to what they're saying as they are to the president.
85,16,"Well, I don't think you are being satirical here, but the point of the ACA is for the most part to help prevent the spread of HIV. The mask is just a part of the stimulus bill. But, if that is true then it would be a very good idea for people to wear the mask."
86,16,"You can still get some decent treatment under the AIDS legislation, especially if you are a major provider of health care and not a primary provider."
93,16,"Why are the ""I'm not against vacks mandates cuz i don't think i ll catch the cough i already had it i m against them cuz they ruin the economy get people fired and people should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force"" words?"
97,16,"""Malms are part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."""
16,1,You don't sound stupid enough to actually think that the President's agenda is a joke.

16,7,"It’s not just about 'The President of the United States', it’s about the President of the United States of America."
16,9,"Why are you even being downvoted? It's really not that bad, there's something wrong with the ACA and what is being promoted for a joke."
16,10,That's the problem. The mask is just an anti-viral way to protect yourself.
16,12,"A very strong piece of information, not just the wikipedia article, is that the government is supporting the spread of AIDS. It's only an excuse. It's a great way to keep a good person safe."
18,16,> Is there a joke about not using the military helmet as a mask?
21,16,"Is it possible that the government uses the name ""troll"" as a synonym for a person whose dickshot is the top comment?"
27,16,I was told that a mask is a joke.
35,16,"No, it isn't a joke. It is a joke. It isn't even a joke at all."
38,16,I wouldn't want to be the one that 'pisses me off' if I were the guy who was infected with HIV/AIDS.
40,16,">Hey, it really did make me cringe a little."
41,16,It's very clear a lot of people have an issue with ACA.
53,16,Is there a problem with the government's work or is it a political issue?
58,16,I would rather have a good time than being an authority than trying to figure it out.
59,16,I just walked in. I think he's just an asshole.
65,16,"The problem with this is the perception of people with AIDS as a threat. In America, I think this is a good thing, not the 'war' for the people with AIDS."
76,16,if you've got a phobia of football then you're a racist. i don't get it.
80,16,It was a joke and I don't think any of them are going to say anything to the players.
85,16,"It’s not a joke, but the President is probably right, and that’s why he’s wearing a mask. It’s very popular because of the amount of frankness that he seems to have with people, not because it’s about the disease."
86,16,"There is a good example of a mask being used. It was used in the movie, The Doctors. That has a lot of funny jokes."
93,16,"It says that ""he is an opportunistic dictator."
97,16,No one is saying the players don't wear a mask. You are suggesting that they are.
16,1,I was told that a lot of people have an issue with ACA because the Obama administration is racist.
16,2,"I have a friend who is a Republican and I have a friend who is a Republican. He is a conservative, and he's a conservative."
16,5,"if you're not in the military, do you wear a mask or do you get vaccinated?"
16,7,"I don't see how a joke would have to be in reference to something that's actually funny, because there is actually a joke that the government is trying to get rid of HIV/AIDS."
16,9,You're an asshole because you're wearing a mask.
16,10,This is a topic that many people have not thought about.
16,12,"Yes, we can do it."
18,16,If the NSA isn't doing anything then it's a joke.
21,16,It's not a troll. It's a liar.
27,16,It doesn't mean that the CDC is trying to get people to be a good doctor. It means that a certain percentage of people do not have access to all of their medications.
35,16,"I'd say that's a good thing they're working on a solution, not a joke."
38,16,"A prank to protect yourself, even when it's true is nitpicking and it's more like being in a coma with an awful attitude. It's also a joke to not do what people need to do."

41,16,Vaccination is important because people don't get sick from it. It's not about vaccines. It's about being able to go and get tested and then get tested and then get a full life insurance. The problem is that people cannot get sick if they don't get vaccinated. It's a huge prank.
53,16,the ACA is a political issue? The whole thing is really ridiculous.
58,16,"Is this on the ""dumbest"" list?"
59,16,"As a kid I've seen a bunch of CDC articles and the one I'm a member of is like ""... if a doctor can get a degree and just stop the spread of HIV, so they don't get vaccinated, then I wouldn't put on a mask, or not get one of these things on,"" but my parents don't actually use the word ""masked"""
65,16,The CDC does not have the authority to control. They are trying to do this so that people who can't stand the CDC can continue the HIV epidemic.
76,16,There's a guy that I've shaved my head before and was still a little scared about. That's a very common misconception among the players.
80,16,"'Mash a mask is a crime', 'You're not on the team, it's just not the team.'"
85,16,"So the ""'User Mask"" thing goes back to ""Why should I wear a mask for the sake of me?"""
86,16,Having a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.Having a mask would help prevent people from getting shot. But the problem with the mask is that people who wear it don't know how to walk because they think it's bad.
93,16,"What's your point. The President is doing the ACA for the government. It was created because of his 'opportunism'. If he wanted to repeal it, they would have voted to repeal it."
97,16,"It's not a joke, it's a joke. It's a joke."
16,1,That’s an absurdly simple satire.
16,2,"I don't know what the real reason for people to complain about Obamacare is, but the current administration is probably the best in terms of not having to go to school at least to meet the requirements of the Affordable Care Act (ACA)."
16,5,"I think people are confused about the ""Secrets of the Administration"" because of how the ""sale of Obamacare"" and the ""events"" are being negotiated."
16,7,"This is a very apt description of a joke I would have to have read on the Internet, a post written by the author that includes: ""It's important because people can get tested and then get tested and then get tested and then get a full life insurance."""
16,9,"I'd like to mention the last part, I mean that if the NSA were a joke they'd be able to put in a whole bunch of effort to stop the spread of AIDS and I'd like it if they could do something to stop it, but they're not the NSA - I'm just saying they don't want to put on any masks and that they need to know what's going on, so if they want to keep an eye on the CDC, they can't be a joke."
16,10,There is an interesting parallel between wearing a mask in public and being a politician.
16,12,"> ""The first thing they did when i walked into a public place was to put a mask on, then put it on a guy who was sick and who had a virus. It was a horrible thing to do. I did."", ""I have to admit that this guy has done what's best for him. I'm not a politician. I'm on a vacation and didn't take the time to pick up on a virus."", ""'"
18,16,There are several stories of someone who wears a military helmet when the CIA is infiltrating the US health system. The US has a huge problem with it. It's difficult to convince the CIA to put an effective prevention of disease.
21,16,This is not a political discussion. This is a business meeting.
27,16,"As I've said, it's very sad to know that this is the first time I have ever heard this joke."
35,16,And you're being a snob? What is your issue? Why are you here?
38,16,[NAME] is an American politician. His name is John Podesta.
40,16,"The first person to say that the ACA is part of the government is a prankster, a snide joke. It is also a joke about the CDC not wanting to put the ACA on the president, and a prankster joke about the president not wanting to do it."
