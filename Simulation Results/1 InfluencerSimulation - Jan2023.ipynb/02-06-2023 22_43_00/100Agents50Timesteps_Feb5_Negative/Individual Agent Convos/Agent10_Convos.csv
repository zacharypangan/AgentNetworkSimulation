90,10,yes the newest strain is soooooo contagious just bc they have a mask on their hands pics don t mean they re using it
93,10,i m not against vacks mandates cuz i don t think i ll catch the cough i already had it i m against them cuz they ruin the economy get people fired and people should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force
10,8,"Well, i'd prefer to wear my vaccinated person's mask when I was a kid."
16,10,You can get a helmet if you do that in public.
18,10,I'm the ol'maroon
38,10,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
45,10,Then you will be arrested.
56,10,"Does your name scream ""Lmao, dear the gun works the gun works the mask doesn t""? I have a friend who has the same comment and she tries to get the shit off, so she wears the mask to protect herself"
66,10,"If you don't want to do that, do it!"
69,10,This is so ridiculous and ridiculous it is like a rant from a tv station :(
77,10,"Its not contagious either, it is contagious just bc they have a mask on their hands pics don t mean they re using it no thafia is coming from my stubs"
86,10,"i think the implication of this post is that trump is a douchebag. i do nt know if the whole thing relates to the man of my word covid, but that it relates to the person wearing a mask."
90,10,"You know what they say about the newer strain of virus, is that people who put a mask on their hands and they do not want to be exposed to it?"
93,10,i m not against vacks mandates cuz i don t think i ll catch the cough i already had it i m against them cuz they ruin the economy get people fired and people should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force
10,8,"So, if you get a mask, you don't have to wear a mask because you're infected, because you've already been vaccinated? That's a very good thing."
16,10,I would like a quote about an American woman getting a helmet.
18,10,That's a pretty accurate statement.
38,10,You gotta wear a mask to fight an illness.
45,10,I hate when they make me wear a mask to protect myself
56,10,You have done nothing to stop a sick person from getting a virus. This isn't an easy problem to overcome.
66,10,"> It seems he is being completely disrespectful and that's just not the way to do it. Do not wear masks. If you do, you can wear masks. If you get a jab and do not wear a mask, you can't be doing it."
69,10,"I would go to the med school to be vaccinated. I could wear a mask at the end of an event, but I couldn't make it to the meeting."
77,10,"And, like others have said, the first time I'm a man of my word covid I thought it said ""yes the newest strain is soooooo contagious just bc they have a mask on their hands pics don't mean they're using it"""
86,10,If he walked through the restaraunt and then took off his mask he would be taking off his face and looking at the restaraunt. It was his face and not his body.
90,10,"Using a mask to fight a virus isn't an excuse. If you put a mask on your hands to avoid contracting the virus, you may be able to help prevent it by removing some of the symptoms."
93,10,[Old Government](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence_Making_Violence_Wage_Making_Violence_Gui).
10,8,">I would go to the med school to be vaccinated. I could wear a mask at the end of an event, but I couldn't make it to the meeting."
16,10,You don't have to be a politician to get a helmet in the office or be a citizen.
18,10,"I'm not in the military, but I've been in the military for over 20 years."
38,10,I have never heard this before. It is a very long and very common misconception that people wearing masks are not just vaccinating themselves.
45,10,A mask helps prevent the spread of the disease by keeping the immune system writheing. It's not like the US government wants to do that.
56,10,">And here I am, putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things that i've done in my entire life and i've done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask"
66,10,He has a viral infection. I think it is an infection that he might have from being in the hospital. He has a problem with sex and the disease is so serious he is going to need a vaccinated anti-viral. You may also want to consult a doctor about this.
69,10,"... and if that person were to wear a mask to protect himself, it could have very easily been a retaliation to the very idea of a mask."
77,10,That mask is a very common part of the public's diet.
86,10,I think the implication of this post is that trump is a douchebag. [Women Wear Masks in the United States](http://www.npo.org/articles/trump_wrote/doc-gov-in-trump_for_america__affordable_and_informed_of_trump_affordable_and_informed_of_trump.jpg) is that Trump is a douchebag. (Do you know where I read that?)
90,10,There is a lot more to this than you're saying.
93,10,"I want you to know that the government has worked to a major degree with the healthcare industry since 1893, where a very small percentage of health insurance companies were willing to provide health care, and a majority of doctors had never gotten sick. I'm not sure how this works, though."
10,8,"I'm not a doctor so I don't know if I'm being disrespectful, but I've seen people wear masks on events because they're more visible."
16,10,"My wife got the government to give her the vaccine she needed. I have a tiniest cough so I'll get the vaccine for if i wear it in public or get a helmet. I think it's a good idea to get vaccinated, and not to throw it on the playground."
18,10,"I have to tell you, I don't believe it. The fact that you don't get sick by wearing a mask is a part of what made Trump invading this country, and this would be a good reason to not get sick because you're a civilian is a whole different story, and this is a stupid idea that is a mistake."
38,10,a lot of things the government wants to do are not going to help the health of America. They just want to try to prevent those things and stop them from spreading them.
45,10,We need to ban vaccinating the public as soon as possible. Vaccinating is about promoting better health. We need to end these'myths' like HIV/AIDS and stop being a virus in general. We need to cut down on the amount of stuff you can do that could damage your health.
56,10,This was a part of the ACA as part of the measures deployed by the government.
66,10,He should never wear a mask. I don't know what that means...
69,10,I'm not saying I think they're not a good idea. I'm saying that I don't want to be a president and that it's a good idea.
77,10,It's pretty hard to tell if someone had an illness or not in their body. I don't really see why the people are asking for help here. Especially the guy who wants to tell us what he's doing. The one who actually needs help is the guy who wants to show some self-confidence.
86,10,>The truth about the president being a shady asshole is that he is a shady asshole. The president does not need to wear a mask because he is not wearing a mask.
90,10,"That's a bit obtuse, but the current HIV epidemic 'Stop using the CDC', 'Case of Origin', etc.. are not all ACA related."
93,10,We're talking about a bunch of different ACA laws enacted by the US Congress.
10,8,"I am a physician and i wear masks all the time. I know I am not a doctor but that I could not make it to my health school. I've seen people wear them because they are more visible, but I'm a doctor. I don't know why you think you're being disrespectful."
16,10,>You don't have to be a politician to get a helmet in the office or be a citizen.
18,10,"As a military veteran, I am sure I would read the article."
38,10,It is a common misconception that people who don't wear masks are not just vaccinating themselves.
45,10,Vaccination is the most important thing of all to be taken into consideration. Do you have a job? You don't have to wear a mask for an American. Why are people in the military and at sports events like hockey or soccer not wearing a mask? They need to start taking responsibility for the health care system for the citizens.
56,10,Why not just get a government-funded medical insurance policy?
66,10,You are a troll.
69,10,There is not an anti-VPH legislation to prevent anyone from getting a virus. The government tries to stop it.
77,10,"Apparently they are only focusing on the death of the president and they are trying to stop his health, not just the illness."
86,10,"'Why don't you wear my mask if it is a health problem? The most important thing to do is to take care of your health, not your health."
90,10,I'm from Indiana and I understand your argument. I really enjoy the movie.
93,10,The ObamaCare Act was passed in 2000 by the govt.
10,8,"They haven't done anything to prevent the spread of the virus. It's not as bad as saying ""I want to be a doctor and it isn't a good idea."" or ""You don't have to be a politician to get a helmet in the office or be a citizen."" Or ""I do not have to be a politician to get a helmet in the office or be a citizen."""
16,10,"I think it's important to wear a mask, and you shouldn't be getting into trouble for it. It is the President's idea of safety."
18,10,"I was in the military in the 80s and it's the biggest problem for my entire life. I've been in the military for over 20 years and this is an interesting and interesting fact about how people use and defend masks, because I think they are good ways to protect themselves."
38,10,It is actually a common misconception that people who do not wear masks are not just vaccinating themselves.
45,10,> Why are people in the military and at sports events like hockey or soccer not wearing a mask? They need to start taking responsibility for the health care system for the citizens.
56,10,"CANNOTANSWER: Why not just get a government-funded medical insurance policy? I've read a LOT of anti-vaccine articles lately, but this particular one was a little off-putting."
66,10,You are a troll.
69,10,"Unless you get a visa or medical degree from the government, you would be fine. The government is just trying to prevent a virus from getting in your country and it isn't working. I'm not trying to make you look like an idiot, but I can't help thinking about the things you said."
77,10,CANNOTANSWER: I'm not a big fan of Obama but I do like the idea of having people vote to get the president to wear masks.
86,10,"You're talking about the ""people who wear a mask"" issue. I can't remember the last time I posted about the mask thing and it actually got a lot of downvotes on here. I really wish the posts were similar."
90,10,"I'm not a doctor or drug dealer, but I've read the ACA as a sign that the CDC is a good place to start. I see no reason they need to force you to wear a mask to protect yourself."
93,10,"In other words, if the gov't wants to get rid of it, the gov't can't."
10,8,The ACA was passed by the govt in 2000. It passed a few years before the current government was a thing. This is the first time the ACA has been passed by the govt. The ACA has been passed. They are not trying to stop the spread of the virus.
16,10,A man can get a helmet in his office because he's not in the military or a citizen.
18,10,This is the most downvoted thing I've read in the last year.
38,10,That's a really good reason to get vaccinated.
45,10,"Vaccination is not a joke, it's part of a government policy. It's also an attempt at preventing a population from being at a con. I shave my head, and that's very uncomfortable, but not very safe. Putting on a mask is the only thing that makes it comfortable. I don't think it's possible to go to a con without having to wear a mask, it's just possible to just wear one for the rest of the day and it will be a very long time."
56,10,"The article was about a CDC clone. I don't know why anyone had to vote on it, but that's just me. I think it's interesting. The article is interesting. The article is on this website. It does not quote anything cited."
66,10,"I'm not the president, but I love the title. I was about to say something about the ACA being a huge failure and it's the biggest political challenge. It's the biggest political challenge. The people who pushed for it are the ones that made it illegal. The government is vetoing the ACA is a violation of our constitutional rights. You are just a troll."
69,10,">I'm fairly certain OP read the article and thought ""You should wear a mask in your car alone your gullible and submissive not traits you want to project."""
77,10,"The President's mask is as dangerous as his hands. The President's mask would be just as dangerous as his hands. He'd be wearing his mask to show some rage to the people, but would then be able to stand up for himself. So that's why I'm an anti-HIV/AIDS supporter."
86,10,"It's a good idea to just keep using the term 'drug-asshole'. If a nut job is an issue, you can't just leave it alone. It's a good idea to leave it alone, but if you get caught out of it, the problem will fucking continue to escalate into another epidemic."
90,10,I would not be so sure of that. It's a very good example of how bad the government is. Considering there are two major parties involved.
93,10,> 'The president is a tyrant who wants to get rid of any form of health care.
10,8,> [We are going to say this about twitchcon and masks you can hate me if the state town doesn t have any mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask.]
16,10,"I hate people who don't wear a mask in public, but I've heard a lot of people complain about how much the government is trying to prevent the spread of the virus. Apparently the government is trying to stifle the spread of this virus and the NSA is trying to do something about it."
18,10,"This is an interesting and interesting fact about how people use and defend masks, because I think they are good ways to protect themselves."
38,10,"A lot of people are trying to tell their children the facts. And if they don't know this, then they'll think it's a joke."
45,10,"Vaccination is NOT a joke, it's part of a government policy. It's also an attempt at preventing a population from being at a con. ""The mask is the only thing that makes it comfortable. I don't think it's possible to go to a con without having to wear a mask."
56,10,I think it's interesting. The article is interesting.
66,10,"The problem is that he is wearing the mask, and that you are the troll."
69,10,"I'm sorry, but I just wanted to give the news a heads up to the people who've seen this movie."
77,10,"I'm not a big fan of Obama either, but it's not something I've found particularly entertaining. It's not like I think the president is crazy enough to want the President to wear a mask? It's just so much better than a doctor, or even a doctor with a friend who wants to fight for HIV in an effort to stop it."
86,10,"'The truth about the president being a shady asshole is that he is a douchebag. ''Why don't you wear my mask if it is a health problem? The most important thing to do is to take care of your health, not your health.""''"
90,10,"If he's talking about this kind of thing, then it's because he's a guy who hates Obama and has been overreacting in this situation. You'd be surprised how much hate he is."
93,10,"""We're talking about a bunch of different ACA laws enacted by the US Congress."""

16,10,They don't want a joke about it. They want to get it out of it.
18,10,The US is also infiltrated by drug companies in ways that I can't remember.
38,10,He's trying to prove that being a dick isn't good for someone who has to deal with an infection.
45,10,"This is the most important thing of all to be taken into consideration. Do you have a job? You don't have to wear a mask for an American.

56,10,I would have liked this to go on the wiki page to see a link to the article.
66,10,There is a lot of people who think wearing a mask is the best way to stop the spread of a virus.
69,10,oh shit that is a fucking joke
77,10,"if you want to do anything for the president, don't."
86,10,The whole issue isn't about him. It's about the fact that he's a douche.
90,10,"I'm not gonna go and say I'm a huge fan of the ACA, but the ACA has no effect on me and my parents. I don't believe the ACA is a sexist or antisemitic, and the ACA itself is insufferable."
93,10,"They can't do anything without the consent of a doctor, as a government-funded narcotics trade scheme. The govt is also not going to go ahead and force someone to pay someone to take a shot."
10,8,"""I think the mask is a good thing but I don't know if I'm being disrespectful,"""
16,10,Why does a person who doesn't wear a mask in public complain about the ACA?
18,10,People have an incredibly limited idea of what is in it.
38,10,You are a dumbass. You are an idiot.
45,10,"Vaccination is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.As someone who has attended many of these events and is a member of a group on the sidelines, I can say that this is a very important part of the conversation. I wouldn't be surprised if someone is trying to try and get a job out of this conversation without getting into it. I'd be okay with some things just coming up without it. If anything, I'd just be like ""I'm not a joke, but the fucking"
56,10,I'm not sure about the sarcasm. I think the ACA is the only good thing that has been done.
66,10,"I am a doctor, and I believe the virus is a virus. I just have a feeling it is coming up and I think I'm going to be more reliant on the government in this situation and don't have the money to pay for the disease. I can't believe it's coming up because of the virus."
69,10,You're talking about the idea of a mask and not the fact that it is going to become a prank.
77,10,"CANNOTANSWER (r-cdc): ""I just feel that it's unnecessary, but it does sound like it's a little bit of a satire. The ACA is not a joke, its a prank and a joke."
86,10,The fuck. The president is a dick and a hypocrite.
90,10,I know people who don't even know what the movie was.
93,10,Is the ACA only a temporary solution to the issues of the US economy? No.
10,8,"I am not a doctor, and I have seen people wear masks all the time."
16,10,I don't have to get an ad on that.
18,10,...I read the article in a foreign language. It was the whole movie that was funny and funny.
38,10,I don't think this is a joke either.
45,10,I don't think it's funny that people don't realize that it's actually just the way a movie explains that it is going to work?
56,10,>I would have liked this to go on the wiki page to see a link to the article.
66,10,"So, what's the point of a mask that makes a virus if it's infecting an individual?"
69,10,You can also fuck with the way things are going with Trump on a daily basis.
77,10,"ACA isn't a joke, its a satire."
86,10,The president has the power to make his comments.
90,10,I'm not sure what your answer is here.
93,10,"I don't know, I can't believe that the guy who wrote this article hasn't even been out for a few months."
10,8,">""Well, i'd prefer to wear my vaccinated person's mask when I was a kid."", ""So, if you get a mask, you don't have to wear a mask because you're infected, because you've already been vaccinated? That's a very good thing."""
16,10,Vaccines are not a problem for the United States. Those policies are not going to change as quickly as the CDC is trying.
18,10,Those are the people who are not supposed to be trolls. Those are the people who are not supposed to be trolls.
38,10,"""He said his genitals aren't well. He told his doctors he wasn't doing enough, but that his doctors didn't tell him."", ""The fuck is going on."
45,10,"I am a big fan of the ""The Man Who shaved His Head"" joke. I believe the entire article has some references to the movie."
56,10,">I was in the middle of this debate a few days ago and I was really confused. Do you see any of the people in the video saying that the ACA does not exist because it is an evil ideology? Nope, it's a BS article."
66,10,Is the president aware of the fact that it was vetoed? Because no one is aware of it and not aware of it's effect.
69,10,"I'm not a lawyer, but I do have to do some reading before I start this post. I'm in college and I know how to read and write and have some time to get a taste of my parents and other Americans."
77,10,"There's an article a long time ago about how the government is getting vaccinated to the AIDS epidemic, saying that if they don't wear masks, they will just be uninvited and could be dead. This would be a good example of how you can become the president and put your foot down as much as you can, and then not be able to afford to get vaccinated."
86,10,Those two things don't apply to you.
90,10,You're not wrong. The movie is a good example of how the Obama administration has dealt with the health care system. The movie is a great example of how the Obama Administration has dealt with the health care system.
93,10,The Obamacare Act was enacted by the US Congress in 2000 and only was passed by Congress in 2000. The new Obamacare Act was passed in 2000 by the govt.

16,10,"Vaccines are not a problem for the United States. Those policies are not going to change as quickly as the CDC is trying.

18,10,"Honestly, it's not so much that he's trying to make the government stop the spread of HIV. It's that the NSA's policies on the subject aren't being enforced, because they're not allowing HIV into the public."

66,10,I've said this in two other places. I was asked why the 'Victory Clause' in this movie isn't going to be in the headline.
69,10,"I don't know how you got it. My mom was in the same situation and the first thing I did was wear a mask, and he was wearing a mask all the time when he drew up in front of the people who were watching the movie and she just told me, that this was a joke, but she was not one of those people. I felt horrible at the same time I was watching the movie."
77,10,"IANAL, but I think your quote is really pretty accurate. The ACA is a joke, but it also does a good job of explaining the importance of the ACA. I guess you're thinking about the idea of the President wearing a mask."
86,10,I can't believe it's been downvoted but I can believe it is.
90,10,"""Making a mask for the ACA does not prevent people from getting sick, it causes you to suffer and you have to go to the doctor for that."""
93,10,It's a terrible thing. I'm sorry.
10,8,"They don't want to veto anything that the ACA does not affect and the government has to use the health care laws that prevent people from getting sick. Essentially, they want people to have the health insurance because they are in the clear and they can get it because they want to."
16,10,"I'm not a politician, but I think wearing a mask is important to keep your head clean, because in addition to stifling the spread of AIDS, it is also vital to maintain healthy skin."
18,10,This isn't a joke. This is an actual truth.
38,10,"In the US, it's a national security issue, which is a big part of why most vaccines aren't approved, especially at the start of the war. I think the biggest issue with ACA is that the people with the disease will start using it."
45,10,"If the guy is wearing a mask at a sporting event that's not in any way part of their job, he may be trying to get people to believe his point is a joke."
56,10,I have to be very specific here. You are speaking of a huuuuge conspiracy. You are arguing that the ACA is a BS story and is a prank.
66,10,"He's wearing a mask to stop the spread of a virus and is using it to try to stop the spread of a virus. He does not want to have it 'vaccinated', he wants it to be effective and he wants it to be effective. He's not the president. He wants to get his health in order and is in control of his own business."
69,10,"""They can't just have the President's face off with the whole white house."
77,10,I have heard the ACA was in force for over 5 years. And not the ACA. But not as long as it was made to be in the US.
86,10,I don't want to go in there to comment on why the president is such a dick.
90,10,I think the best way to define the ACA is to use a shield as a defense mechanism for fighting HIV/AIDS. The first thing that happens is to not wear a mask. The second thing that happens is the ACA is a pretty obvious sign that the government is working to stop HIV/AIDS. The ACA is a terrible example of how poorly the government has dealt with this problem. It's like reading The Man Who Killed the President.

38,10,"The CDC is saying the CDC should not be allowed to be vaccinated because it prevents AIDS or other diseases from spreading, which is not even a joke."
45,10,I'd be okay with some things just coming up without it.
56,10,This is why I am not getting all the comments I'm looking for.
66,10,He has an issue with sex. He has a problem with sex and he needs to get vaccinated. He's not the president.
69,10,"They don't care that much about his health, it just seems like they should."
77,10,AMA. AMA. AMA.
86,10,>The whole issue isn't about him. It's about the fact that he's a dick and a hypocrite.'
90,10,It is a horrible example of how poorly the government has dealt with this problem. It is like reading The Man Who Killed the President. It's like reading Apocalypse Now with the President who isn't even a Republican. Isn't that a good idea to you?
93,10,... but the US government doesn't make any kind of health care.
10,8,It's a pretty obvious sign that the government is working to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS.
16,10,CANNOTANSWER:
18,10,"[I think the point of this post is that it sounds like some kind of ridiculous joke. I've just learned that ""the President is a fantastic athlete and an amazing player. He should put on a mask and play football. And the fact that this guy is a dick. The movie is the exact same thing as the one that says he's a dick. The movie is the exact same thing as the one that says he's a dick. The movie is the exact same thing"
38,10,Vaccination is a fad. It's a national security issue. It's a fad.
45,10,"You should see the movie, I'm not a lawyer, but I was interviewed recently for the job interview for a news agency. I got the impression that it was a joke, but I am not sure if it's really a joke. I don't understand why people seem to think that a joke is a joke. It's just a joke, and it's a joke."
56,10,"I'm not an expert on the subject, but the ACA is one of the most controversial obnoxious things that the world has ever seen on the front page. I'd consider it an extreme prank to be a joke."
66,10,"Yes, because he can make it worse. You can he is not a troll."
69,10,A tad humorous.
77,10,You need to read the [AMA. AMA. AMA. AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/cannotanswers). It contains a lot of interesting info.
86,10,In my state the only way a person can get away with it is by wearing a mask.
90,10,The one where you say you're not a Republican who's not a Democrat? It is a pretty good comparison.
93,10,That's about the only thing the article was about.
10,8,"""The whole issue isn't about him. It's about the fact that he's a dick and a hypocrite."""
16,10,CANNOTANSWER: What is the problem with the president wearing a mask in public? It is a shit story.
18,10,"I can't believe it's about someone getting infected, and the CDC has no place in their decision making. They just have to take their own ideas."
38,10,Vaccination is an issue of national security because it isn't about preventing AIDS or other diseases from spreading.
45,10,"I'm not sure why people are interpreting this as a joke, but when people say that 'we need to ban vaccinating the public as soon as possible. Vaccinating is part of a government policy. It's also an attempt at preventing the spread of a virus.'"
56,10,The article itself is interesting. It does not quote anything cited.
66,10,And then there's the 'Peace Clause' thing.
69,10,">... I'm not sure if you're trying to make a ""defensive"" point or just an erudite one, but I feel like I am a dick. I think the best way to end a relationship with him is to get a doctor to tell him that he needs a mask. He said he would like to get an ER check, he wouldn't wear one because he feels like a dick.

86,10,"""The whole issue isn't about him. It's about the fact that he's a douchebag."""
90,10,And the last thing you want to hear is the president is a narcissist.
93,10,'Potentially not working' is a misleading title. A political issue isn't a political issue.
10,8,The article is actually a good read. It's also on the front page. You should read it.
16,10,"It's not a joke, but the joke that people say ""I'm not a politician but I think wearing a mask in public is important to keep your head clean, because in addition to stifling the spread of AIDS, it is also vital to maintain healthy skin."""
18,10,"I've read the movie. It's a pretty good example of how the Obama Administration has dealt with the healthcare system. I like the book and it's a great example of how the Obama administration has dealt with the healthcare system. The first point in the movie is that people aren't necessarily interested in AIDS, but they are interested in CDC and CDC. The only reason they a prank would make people not aware of the virus is if the government had a mandate to not put on a mask."
38,10,"So...the movie is satire. But... besides, I don't think they can say anything about how he's being troll? They can't say a thing and they can't say anything about it."
45,10,Vaccination is a part of the measures deployed by the US government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. I don't know how they made that joke and the fact that it is a joke does not make it a joke. Vaccinating the public as soon as possible. Vaccinating is part of a government policy. It's also an attempt at preventing the spread of a virus.
56,10,"I don't think he was trying to be offensive, but if someone has been trying to say they like the ACA and they don't like it, then I don't think he's arguing it is a prank."
66,10,>He should never wear a mask
69,10,>I just wanted to give the news a heads up to the people who've seen the movie.
77,10,"""It's pretty hard to tell if someone had an illness or not in their body. I don't really see why the people are asking for help here."""
86,10,The president is a douchebag.
90,10,"I just watched the movie on tv, and I thought that was a good one."
93,10,Why is 'Potentially not working' a misleading title? A political issue isn't a political issue.
10,8,The whole movie is satire.
16,10,That's the problem. The mask is just an anti-viral way to protect yourself.
18,10,"What about the one that says, ""The US is also infiltrated by drug companies in ways that I can't remember.""? ""The one that says, ""[I've been in the military for over 20 years and this is an interesting and interesting fact about how people use and defend masks, because I think they are good ways to protect themselves.""?"
38,10,I believe in this movie that this is a prank.
45,10,"It's a joke, and a joke about it."
56,10,A restraining order by the President doesn't apply to the ACA because of the potential danger of infection. The idea of a restraining order is an illegal repercussion for all public health coverage.
66,10,A bunch of trolls are vetoing ACA as a whole. What the fuck?
69,10,"I've already said this before, and I'm pretty sure there's an article from another blog on that topic."
77,10,>I read the book and thought I'd go check it out. But it didn't sound like it had anything to do with the actual question.
86,10,A mask is part of a mask that prevents the spread of AIDS.
90,10,I was reading a book about the Obama administration stating that the ACA was an important part of preventing the spread of HIV. The movie doesn't mention any of that.
93,10,Is the US government actually doing anything to stop the spread of a virus?
10,8,"People get sick. I know the world isn't the same way. The virus, as you imply, is spread through your blood. This is the type of disease that is made up. I'm not sure what the real message is, but it does seem like a prank to me."
16,10,This is a topic that many people have not thought about.
18,10,"I'm a veteran who has been in the military for 20 years. I believe that in order to prevent the spread of AIDS that people are required to wear a mask. However, I also don't believe that if you wear a mask to protect yourself you're being forced to wear a mask. What the article says is that the military doesn't protect your health at all. It was all about safety."
38,10,"As a former president who's tried to make a joke about Vaccination, I find it ridiculous that the CDC and the Obama Administration don't care a bit about the vaccines."
45,10,It's a 'joke' of an attempt to fuck up the health care system. They need to ban it immediately - and in the long run.
56,10,"Those are two big misconceptions that people have about Obama. I think that it's ridiculous the ACA is used to help keep people safe, and people with AIDS aren't getting it."
66,10,"Yes, it is. Is there any good ACA that is about stopping the spread of a virus?"
69,10,There are some real things you can do. You can't live your life in your guise. You're trying to get over it.
77,10,"The ACA is a joke and a joke. The ACA is just a prank and a joke. You can bet the president hasn't heard anything about it, or at least he doesn't have any personal opinion on it."
86,10,"''Why don't you wear my mask if it is a health problem? The most important thing to do is to take care of your health, not your health.'''''I think the implication of this post is that trump is a douchebag."
90,10,"The ACA does not prevent people from getting sick. It causes people to suffer and you have to go to the doctor for that. The movie doesn't mention any of that. The movie is about the ACA, and it's a good example of how poorly the government has dealt with this problem."
93,10,It's a huge conspiracy that is going on among people on both sides of the debate:
10,8,"I like to be reminded that a lot of people think the ACA is really an awful thing because it makes people seem stupid and selfish, because of the health and safety issues that it is causing."
16,10,There is an interesting parallel between wearing a mask in public and being a politician.
18,10,"I thought it was a funny thing for people to tell you that when I wore a mask outside in my car alone (I can't remember what the number is), I was really impressed with the movie itself. But I guess it's not all about the health of people."
38,10,"he's trying to prove that being a dick isn't good for someone who has to deal with an infection. He told his doctors he wasn't doing enough, but that his doctors didn't tell him"
45,10,What's the best way for you to get the joke to work?
56,10,"A restraining order. Not a restraining order. A restraining order is not a repercussion for all public health coverage. ""Isn't the ACA part of the ACA?"""
66,10,"I'm not a doctor, but I love the title of this book. The author and I are going against a very broad interpretation of the law. You should watch this movie, but you should not listen to it."
69,10,I think what you are describing is a joke.
77,10,"> ""I think it's a good idea for the book to be an actual book if the author doesn't explain the concept of this kind of information."
86,10,"I'd say the more recent thing I've read about this is he wears a mask on a lot of things. He's wearing a mask for the obvious reasons. You have to make sure you wear it with your body, and that's what he does. So he does get into trouble for not wearing a mask because he knows that's a bad idea."
90,10,"I have a lot to say about this, and to you too, it's not the ACA, or sexist or antisemitic, or a good example of how badly the gov't has dealt with this problem."
93,10,"A conspiracy theory is an anti-government conspiracy theory, not a real one."
10,8,>We are going to say this about twitchcon and masks you can hate me if the state town doesn't have any mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask.''
16,10,Podesta is a snob and is not a politician.
18,10,"It's a little weird to think that these movies are so big and interesting, it seems as if the NSA is in the White House for a good chunk of their budget. This kind of thing has no measurable effect on the public health."
38,10,"The idea that people need to put in the work of the government to vaccinate is one thing, but the idea that he is trying to change it is another."
45,10,"You're not over-sensitive, you're a dick."
56,10,"It's a joke that you're not even aware of, and I don't think there is much you can do about it."
66,10,"The movie is a pretty good one, and I'm sure you will love it."
69,10,"You think people in this thread don't care about the CDC, aren't they? CDC, and other organizations and associations would be interested in helping prevent the spread of HIV."
77,10,"The ACA is a joke, but the author doesn't seem to understand the concept of it and just doesn't understand it."
86,10,i don't know if that makes sense
90,10,Obama had a great job and was on the front lines to talk about his health. I think Obama pushed the ACA and his policies to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS. But they can't stop the spread of it. The ACA's a great example of how the Obama administration has handled it.
93,10,"""...but the US government doesn't make any kind of health care."""
10,8,"So, why does anyone who is an evangelist like me voted for the Republican party to be the president? Then they would be a hivemind."
16,10,"That is a pretty funny analogy, but one that the CDC has apparently done a great job with."
18,10,I like the movie. The movie is a pretty good example of how the Obama administration has dealt with the healthcare system. It's really important that you realize the difference between a prank and a joke.
38,10,"In my opinion, 'he's wearing a mask because he feels like a dick.' That's just a joke."
45,10,"I'm really glad we can have a little time to chat about a joke. This doesn't have to be a prank, and I love hockey and hockey as well, but I like to enjoy the occasional joke or two."

77,10,> It is a joke because it doesn't address the spread of AIDS.
86,10,I really hate the npo. Mostly because it seems that people don't understand why they need a mask and what not. I'm sure some people do not understand what they're talking about. But they're still probably not gonna get a haircut because it makes a nut job.

38,10,CANNOTANSWER:
45,10,"I'm not a fan of these types of jokes, but I just like to talk about why people would think they're the worst prank ever. I'm pretty much a big fan of the movie, but I do not really care about the context of this premise. It's very interesting to think how people would think of the movie as a prank if they didn't know it was a joke based on how a few people were talking about it, so it would come off as if the humor would be thrown at them."
56,10,"The problem is that they are comparing a mask to a bullet hole. It makes sense to me, but it has a bit of a sense of humour."
66,10,>the only reason we can get a vaccinated candidate is because he's a Democrat
69,10,I just finished reading this - it's so ridiculous.

86,10,"""It's just as unhelpful as it gets."""
90,10,It's an excellent example of how the government has dealt with this problem. It's like reading The Man Who Killed the President.
93,10,That is actually the article. The author's name is [canon] who writes the article.
10,8,"Because of the fact that the ACA isn't a prank, there are actually people that really don't want to get vaccinated, so a lot of things have come out of it."
16,10,I think the CDC should just have to protect people who don't wear a mask to prevent spread.
18,10,"I'm sure this guy is very happy to get the right people to help him, but he's not the only one who would be upset if he tried to use a mask on a victim. I've heard this one already, and it's pretty funny. I hope he gets to know that people with AIDS might be okay with this."
38,10,"People who don't wear masks are putting out some shit. They are telling people to stop using them and then to keep them on their hands if they're doing anything. Vaccination, despite its repercussions, isn't a joke. It is a joke that isn't meant to be."

56,10,"""I'm not against vacks mandates cuz I don't think i'll catch the cough i already had it i'm against them cuz they ruin the economy get people fired and people should be able to choose to choose to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force."""
66,10,"This is a good book, it explains what I've been saying since my first read. It's one of the best reads. I can't believe I read it."
69,10,"It's a very important point, and I think he has some pretty strong sense of humour."
77,10,"I think the author is a dick and has a point of view, that's kind of what the book is about. It's about a guy who's going to be murdered and then put on his mask to try to save lives."
86,10,It's pretty obvious that we are not talking about the issue in general. But in general this is a joke.
90,10,"That's actually actually the right thing to do. The ""the government isn't in charge of healthcare and the ACA doesn't apply to this situation, which is actually actually a problem."""
93,10,The only difference is that the author is an asshole.

16,10,CANNOTANSWER: The problem isn't the actual problem of the virus.
18,10,It sounds like you're referring to a joke of the NSA.
38,10,"In that book, I equated the president's role in spreading AIDS to that of a rape victim. I equated the two to a joke about his prank, which is not the point of this movie."
45,10,The CDC says Presidents don't have to wear masks to be in the presidential election.
56,10,The idea that the ACA is a prank is in fact really important to the ACA.
66,10,"What do you mean ""I want to save some money and protect a man's health."""
69,10,"""We are not really attempting to stop the spread of a virus. The government tries to stop it."""
77,10,"I hardly get the idea of that. I find it pretty ridiculous to talk about the ACA because they are so far removed from the actual ACA, but they do not really seem to be getting any kind of reaction from the public at all, especially considering all of the other stuff."
86,10,It's like he's getting the job because he wants to have that in mind
90,10,"No, the ACA is a prank. The whole ACA thing is a prank. I've read the title, but I didn't think it was a prank at all. The fact that it's on the front page is kind of demeaning."
93,10,You don't say anything about the President who created the ACA.
10,8,"I mean, I've also heard a lot of stories about a doctor who would want to be vaccinated and get to a doctor to help him. He would be able to tell his friend he didn't have a vaccinated father. So, to summarize, he said he felt he was putting his daughter on the front line, so the guy said he stayed and got the mask he wanted when they came out of the back door of his house."
16,10,"It's not an obvious joke, but it's an act of aggression. The ACA is a prank, and the CDC is doing something about it."
18,10,CANNOTANSWER: I'm not an expert on the US healthcare system.
38,10,Because it's a prank!
45,10,They're trying to make the president feel uncomfortable and the situation in the US is dangerous.
56,10,"It’s so ridiculous that the word prank has become so ad hominem, and is now synonymous with “no.” It’s a lot like “hey, I can go to the doctor and I can just go home and buy some drugs”, but that’s the real question - because there is a chance someone will put a mask on and ask if it helps."
66,10,I'm not sure how to explain the sarcasm but I think you're getting the point.
69,10,I was reading a different book. I thought it was funny. It was about a teen girl who had a history of HIV. That was a prank. It was a joke.
77,10,"It's not a joke. It's a joke. But it's a joke. It is a prank and a joke. It's a joke. It doesn't address the issue of the ACA, and it's not a joke."
86,10,There are people with a mask in a million countries in the world.
90,10,A prank doesn't mean that a prankster is a prankster. He's trying to demonize the government by trying to take away a message from the government.
93,10,This is an interesting piece. There's some pretty good research to the topic.
10,8,"I feel like the first one was pretty insensitive as well - I can see some shit there, but it's pretty absurd."
16,10,I think I'm just trying to give you a new perspective on this a little bit. Trying to tell you a little bit about the president and the situation of the US in the world.
18,10,It's really interesting that the article is so funny.
38,10,I think he's putting a hat on himself for not being an ass. You don't know this man he's an ass.
45,10,I can't remember what I read but when I read it I thought it was a prank.
56,10,"CANNOTANSWER: [I'm very much into this topic and I'm more into the ACA because of the fact that the government is supposedly trying to prevent the spread of AIDS.The hat sucks, but it's actually a joke, which is a part of the overall joke. The author of the article is a Democrat, and has been a longtime anti-immigration activist. if the president isn't willing to help with the ACA, I'm not sure what he's a joke."
66,10,"This is a very serious question that has a lot of implications and they may have been referred to as the ""trolls"". They're not the ones who put these things on the ACA. They're the ones who did the veto, not the trolls."
69,10,"The CDC is a huge, huge, well-funded entity that works to prevent and prevent the spread of HIV. I'd be pissed if I was that close to it."
77,10,I read the article citing the CDC and reacted with a very similar response.
86,10,"I was on a roll last night and... The guy asked me if he was going to put on a mask, and he said, ""What the fuck - I'm not wearing a mask. I'm looking at you, my dick."" Then he said, ""Well a doctor in my state was going to make sure you were wearing a mask when you went out and did the same thing,"" And then he said, ""The mask is a prank."""
90,10,"The ACA is a prank, you said it, I don't think it's racist. I don't think the ACA is a prank, I think it's a prank because it's insensitive."
93,10,The author of this article also seems to be stating that the ACA was the cause of the outbreak of AIDS in the US. There are no facts and no facts and the article isn't a conspiracy theory.
10,8,I am a med student and I wear masks at events and get checked every day to get vaccinated. I am a doctor and I don't want to do that.
16,10,CANNOTANSWER is an expert on the US healthcare system.
18,10,I'm the guy in the title.
38,10,I think it's a joke. But I think it's also a prank. Why would you wear a mask on a president who says his genitals aren't well?
45,10,"They don't have to rape everyone in this sub, because a lot of things they've said are just pranks. It's like saying the ""I don't know why people think it's a joke."""
56,10,">[(http://www.enhs.gov/resources/nhs-aca/) The article itself isn't about the ACA but is rather a prank. In this article, they say that a lot of people are saying that the ACA is not going to work and the CDC is helping. You don't even have the right to get a syringe. This is the only one you can actually get a hat for. I'm going to call the cops and see what they're doing."
66,10,The veto was done as a reversal of a veto. The veto was an unambiguous veto he is vying for and that means he isn't on the right track to stop it. This is a veto he is nelving.

77,10,I find it pretty ridiculous to talk about the ACA because the author doesn't explain the concept of it.
86,10,That's a great reason. Apparently the government doesn't understand what a prank is about and they don't give a damn about what it is about.
90,10,This post is a slew of lies and sexist shit.
93,10,"It's not about the politics of the country, it's about the conspiracy theories underlying everything."
10,8,The ACA was the cause of the epidemic that killed a lot of people in 2010 and 2010 without the consent of the President. This was in response to the AIDS epidemic. The ACA wasn't a prank.
16,10,What is the point of the article?
18,10,Well that makes sense. He could've been fired or even killed if the mask wasn't on at all.
38,10,Vaccination is a prank. But it's a prank. He needs to get the treatment.
45,10,This is an awful combination of “I don’t want to come in and be the best joke ever” and “I think it’s a funny prank”.
56,10,CANNOTANSWER: I'm very much into this topic and I'm more into the ACA because of the fact that the government is supposedly trying to prevent the spread of AIDS.
66,10,"I have no reason to care if the author is a troll, just that I think he was being nutty."
69,10,"So there is a book where a politician is a racist racist rant. The author says he likes the idea of a mask, but it's a prank about a hat?"
77,10,You just answered all of these questions.

86,10,This is the sort of problem that most Americans don't understand - a mask does not stop HIV spread and makes the US immune to infections. That's why you can't get a hat and a mask. So they do not wear a mask. It only prevents HIV from spreading.

10,8,It’s not a prank to me unless it’s the ACA. It’s a prank because it’s a joke and it isn’t in the White House. The ACA repeal isn’t even close to the ACA repeal. I can’t think of a better way to say it than that. But I know what the premise is – and I do know where it came from. It’s not just a prank but a way to stop people that want to get vaccinated.

45,10,I think this is the most obvious way to get this to work:
56,10,"The ACA is a joke and a prank. The ACA is a joke. If the President didn't go to a doctor and ask him to have an exam and the restraining order, he wouldn't be able to help the AIDS epidemic."
66,10,Is the president getting a vaccinated? No.
69,10,I think it's a good joke. But if he wants to take up a new job he can't. This is how he's perceived. There is a good chance he's trying to get himself to do something he's a doctor trying to do on behalf of himself.
77,10,I think the ACA is the first thing that comes to mind.

""The president will go to an ER and get a medical degree."" Then in response he will be using the movie to further his position."
77,10,"It's not a joke, just an antisemitic act. I'm sure the person who was trying to defend the president is a little more interested in the issue, especially when it comes to the president's health."
86,10,I don't think the president is a douchebag.
90,10,"Obamacare is a very complicated and deeply ingrained system. He doesn't like the idea of a big government prank, but it's very real. It isn't supposed to be a prank. It's only a big part of the health care system, a really important one."

93,10,I'm not in a position to suggest the repeal is an option. I think it will be on the front page because the American media is not showing up to make a clear statement about the issue.
10,8,"The problem here isn't just whether it's a prank, but whether the idea of it is a prank is a good thing."
16,10,"Those things can be a joke because they are not very popular. Whether you want to see a real joke or not is up to you. It’s a joke. The ACA is a joke, and the CDC is working to protect the people who don’t wear a mask in public."

38,10,"I think this is one of the many things the US has done wrong in this regard. Vaccination has the potential to spread HIV, which is a serious issue to have. It's only a matter of time before these kinds of incidents are a thing that can cause people to live longer."
45,10,It's not a joke.
56,10,"I've been reading a lot of anti-vaccine articles recently, but this particular one was a little off-putting. I'd consider it an extreme prank to be a joke."
66,10,The ACA is a major mistake and a veto is the biggest challenge ever. The veto is going to be a huge failure. You're going to need to do something about this in order to win this fight. It would be a good book if you wanted to take this out of context.

90,10,I don't want to be the one to think of this as a prank.

The ACA is the biggest political challenge in history and is the biggest failure in the last 30 years. The entire article seems to be about a huge conspiracy that is going on among people on both sides of the debate:
10,8,I am so excited that this ACA repeal is going to get a response from the US Congress. Having the President get vaccinated for HIV and other illnesses in order to help his daughter and get vaccinated is going to be the best possible thing for him. Having the president and the Obama administration together at a time when he is not a party figure in the ACA and the country as a whole are going to need to be at the forefront of all this.

66,10,This is where I live. I'm in NY.
69,10,"""I read the article and thought that I am going to get a doctor to tell him that he needs a mask in his car."""
77,10,"This book is very informative. It's also pretty good at explaining a whole lot of things about the president, including things about the Obama administration. I think it's a good example of what a guy can do to help make people aware of the president, as well as to get people to vote for him."
86,10,"This is the joke about the president wearing a mask to protect against HIV - the virus is NOT a joke. The ACA is a joke and it’s not about that - it’s about the people who wear a mask to prevent the spread of HIV. The CDC does not even have to be involved in combating it. The ACA is a joke, but it’s not supposed to prevent HIV."
90,10,"""""It's a prank, because it is a prank. It is a prank, because it is a prank""""."
93,10,">I want you to know that the government has worked to a major degree with the healthcare industry since 1893, where a very small percentage of health insurance companies were willing to provide health care, and a majority of doctors had never gotten sick. I'm not sure how this works, though."""
10,8,No. This isn't a joke. It's a prank.
16,10,"It seems like the most egregious and most controversial thing in America, including the fact that the president isn't even a politician, who wears a mask in public. And so it hasn't even got any of the facts."
18,10,"""I don't believe the CDC has no place in the government's decision making."""
38,10,You're going to have to say something.
45,10,"The CDC needs to stop making that movie ""same"" because they already know it's a joke. It's an attempt to get people to laugh at it, and I think it's hilarious that that joke was made in 2003."
56,10,"People here think that Obamacare is a joke. They are referring to the fact that it has not been repealed. The ACA doesn't have a mandate to cover everyone who wants a health insurance policy. Unless it was part of a restraining order that only covers people who need it, I don't see why it should matter if the government wants to cover all of us who don't have it."
66,10,"""The ACA is the best answer for a lot of Americans, and a big part of it is a ""good answer"" vs. ""regularly bad."""
69,10,"A good way to end a relationship is to get a doctor to tell him to wear a mask to protect himself and his family. It is not a prank, it is a prank."
77,10,- You've been reading the book. [A lot of people are misinformed about what the ACA is. The author is the one who wrote the book.](http://www.reddit.com/r/cannotanswers).
86,10,"Well, I guess that's why I wrote ""The President is a douchebag. "" and I didn't say a shady asshole. But I think I'm a douchebag because I think this is the most important thing to do to protect you. Because if I was a dick, I'm a dick""."
90,10,"OP: Obamacare is a prank. This is a good example of how the government has dealt with the health care system. It is a good example of how the government has dealt with the health care system. Sadly, a lot of our issues are so obvious and inconsiderate."
93,10,">The article states that the president is not able to take action to get rid of the ACA. The author of the article is a Democrat and has been a longtime anti-immigration activist. I think this is one of those cases where ""need"" is a hive mind. ""The need"" is just an excuse to snare the real president."
10,8,"I read the article and read the premise of the book, not the story itself."
16,10,CANNOTANSWER is an expert on the US healthcare system.
18,10,"The author is obviously trying to give away this film, and the whole thing isn't about the CDC. It's about the medical industry, and it's not about the healthcare industry, not the military and not about the CDC."
38,10,It's just a joke. And you mean the CDC and the media are trying to cover it up and make a joke about AIDS?
45,10,The government is going to be a good place to start. I'd like to read more about it.
56,10,>(http://www.enhs.gov/resources/Nhs-Aca/) The article itself isn't about the ACA because of the potential danger of infection. The idea of a restraining order is not a repercussion for all public health coverage.
66,10,I'm just letting you know that your comment is pretty similar to the one of a political author (I'm a doctor and I believe the ACA is a major crappy thing to pass)
69,10,AIDS can spread into millions of people. A prank is a joke.
77,10,Is it a satire or something?
86,10,That’s a really good reason to avoid pranking.
90,10,Because of the fact that it is an example of how poorly the government has handled the healthcare system.
93,10,"CANNOTANSWER: ""I think people have a problem with the government but they also have a problem with the government. The ACA is the biggest political challenge in history and is the biggest failure in the last 30 years. The article states that the president is not able to take action to get rid of the ACA. The author of the article is a Democrat and has been a longtime anti-immigration activist. I think you have the right idea. The ACA repeal isn't about the ACA repeal isn't an issue of political conspiracy theory."
10,8,"I can see that. I'm not a politician. I'm not a doctor. I'm a physician. I know I'm not a doctor, but I can see a lot of things that come out of it."
16,10,If it's a joke then maybe the CDC should be doing something about it. You gotta tell OP the difference between 'i wear a mask when i'm in public' and 'I don't have to be a politician to get a helmet in the office or be a citizen. '
18,10,I don't think pranks will be seen as jokes. That is a big point.
38,10,Vaccination is the name of the bill that Congress passed to keep the US from importing foreign disease into the US
45,10,The movie is an excellent article and it's also an attempt at preventing the spread of a virus. The movie does indeed include some of the best examples of what the government is trying to prevent.
56,10,It's a joke that people don't understand.
66,10,">Is the author aware of the fact that it was vetoed? Because no one is aware of it and not aware of it's effect."""
69,10,It's an apologies for being a bit more insensitive in the title. It seems that the author has a hard time accepting that it's a joke.
77,10,"You may be reading ""Cannot Care"" or ""Cannot CARE"" and ""Incident of the President""."
86,10,">An article about the mask is ""[President Donald] wearing a mask to prevent the spread of HIV."
90,10,"If someone is in this discussion about Obamacare, this is something I would be interested in."
93,10,"CANNOTANSWER: I think the article is about a massive conspiracy, based on false evidence."
10,8,"CANNOTANSWER: ""This is the only ACA I would wear to the front line."""
16,10,">I'm not a politician but I think wearing a mask in public is important to keep your head clean, because in addition to stifling the spread of AIDS, it is also vital to maintain healthy skin."", ""The problem with wearing a mask in public is that it is a problem to prevent spread."
18,10,>The article is based on an article that is referred to by a veteran who is a veteran and a military veteran.
38,10,"Vaccination is a joke, and it's actually a joke. Vaccination is a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke, not a joke."
45,10,"It's not really a joke at all. It's a joke that's been put on display as an attempt to make people laugh. Vaccination is a joke. The only joke I can think of that has come to light is that it's a joke, and that it's a joke. Vaccination is not a joke. It's part of a government policy. It's also an attempt to stop the spread of a virus. It's not a joke."
56,10,I've seen the first three.
66,10,"It's a good one, I’ll start with it. Thanks!"
69,10,"In the US, AIDS is a disease that can spread into millions of people. There are dozens of ways to prevent it."
77,10," I've read the book, too'', ''Phoenix''', ''You have to read it'''', ''Cannot Care'' ('Cannot Care''), ''I'm not a fan of Obama, but I do like the idea of having people vote to get the President to wear a mask.""'''. '(http://www.ny.gov/hp/hp/fb/info.html#HIPAA_EASE.jpg)"
86,10,I really don't get it.
90,10,No. The ACA is a prank. But it has no effect on people in the US. Obama pushed it.
93,10,This is a piece about the government in a negative light.
