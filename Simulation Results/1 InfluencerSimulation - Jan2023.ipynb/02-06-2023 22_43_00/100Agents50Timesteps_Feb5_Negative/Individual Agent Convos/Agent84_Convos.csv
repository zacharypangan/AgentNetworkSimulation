101,84,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
84,2,I am pretty sure this is a fact. I am just going to go ahead and say that I am just going to stop doing what it is gonna do. But I don't want to hear anyone saying I am a bit out of touch about it.
84,22,Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of a virus. Please wear masks.
84,24,We do it because i know we need to. If you can't even come to a game and try to win a game you can't go to a game and get a helmet. I believe if you don't wear a mask then I would go to the games with my team. I'm sure the coaches can't do much besides get tripped by the players on the field and the coach will feel bad about it.

If you have to work with a coach, then he needs to be able to work on his own skills."
84,52,It's time to stop blaming us for that.
84,53,I have some friends from high school who would go to college wearing a mask for their teammates to help prevent the spread of a virus.

84,56,I have to disagree with you that if a coach can't handle being a coach that doesn't respect the rules he shouldn't be able to keep himself safe and do all of the work he can to get this problem sorted out then he can't be a coach.
84,58,This doesn't sound like a very good plan for you.

85,84,I just came in to explain why people wear masks to fight the virus.
95,84,"In the movie ""I've been with you for four years"" you get to see a lot of movies about the effect of using a mask to protect yourself and the effects of a virus on your body. In my opinion, it's the most powerful way to stop the spread of a virus. It's more than just a mask. It's like a mask you can wear at work."
98,84,"IANAL, but I don't care about the title. I don't understand the politics here but the point of this post is to make it clear that the government is not going to enforce anti-virus laws.

84,69,I don't think the issue of anti-virus is a good one. I don't know if i want to get into politics or not but I don't think this would be a good enough topic.
84,78,Then when the problem is solved they're going to continue to run it with a fear of the government (too many things) for fear of getting caught a virus.
84,81,I'm going to take a little humor to it. What do you think about the current state of health care?

84,24,The team needs to resign. Because it's one of the best jobs for our country to have a professional head coach. It's really important for their coach to be able to do his job well.

It's about how he responds, not to be honest, but the snarky, stupid, hated"
84,53,What a dick move. I think the president needs to resign. I would hate to hear about someone that does this to my team. The president needs to show his disrespect to his staff. I would not want to be my coach. I would make the team do it because they have a problem with the National Guard defending players who don't wear masks to fight a virus that has already spread. I'd be scared that the other team won't recognize my name. I don't think we are all in a big deal about a man who is a guy

84,51,If he's not playing the game then he's not a good coach. That means he has to learn how to deal with this. It's a bad way for the president to be doing what he can to stop the spread of a virus and to actually do the right thing.
84,52,This is why we have the US Military Vaccination Act
84,53,"No one seems to have much insight into what's actually going on. I'd love to hear it, but it's a hard one."
84,54,Why not just wear it to a snob?
84,56,"I believe the issue is not that the masks are bad, but that it's really not that big a deal that a guy like this is doing it."
84,58,It's the president's job to go after players with a 'vaccine' before the epidemic gets started. That is why it is important to be able to take care of them with a mask.
84,64,"As the president, it is my understanding that coaches need to be in the position to be educated on what's going on. I don't think it's going to work. I think it will be a good reason for them to get rid of the mask."
84,69,I don't think he's a snob. He's a snob. He's a snob.
84,78,I think the president is probably being a snob because of the mask. I think it's a good point.
84,81,>The president is doing the best he can. The government is trying to get a solution that works against the virus.
84,83,"I want to point out that, unlike the other comments, the guy is probably a bit of a snob because of the mask. I would also like to point out that the guy is probably a bit of a snob because of the mask."
85,84,"I think it's a really interesting idea, but I'm not gonna argue that the idea isn't as wildly controversial as the people saying, because of the ACA. It is a big deal."
95,84,"I was just listening to the audiobooks and I didn't really know what I was doing. I thought that I was being sarcastic and was just being a prank and not saying anything or doing anything in any way. So the movie was great. I thought it was a prank, but I had to stop watching because of what the movie was about."
98,84,I think it is pretty clear that the government is trying to protect the public health and I think that's a pretty common thing.
100,84,"Wearing a mask to prevent infection is a pretty common medical treatment. In the US, there's a lot of preventable infections that aren't treated with a mask, but can be treated with a regular diet. If a person is suffering from AIDS, they're not able to get away with it without using a mask, even though they were infected."
101,84,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
84,2,"I'm not a snob, but... so, I don't know why you got downvoted for a different sentence."
84,22,"The article seems to indicate the President's goal was not to prevent the AIDS epidemic, the president's job was to get rid of the mask. However, he's already trying to do it. The ACA is a little bit in the air - it could be a very long road to the end of AIDS epidemics and if the CDC's program is actually helping to reduce it, it might actually help to put a stop to it. It may not make sense at all, but at least it's a good thing to do it for the president "
84,24,"The president is a snob, but we need to do this to keep the president healthy. We need to do this to keep the president healthy. We must put a mask on and prevent an epidemic."
84,39,I just figured I'd let you know that the president had to resign due to the fact that they didn't say anything. I just thought that the guy was being sarcastic about the movie and the movie being great and the movie wasn't a good movie. I just thought it was hilarious.
84,41,I think the best snobs are the ones in front of the president.
84,44,It sounds like some big deal because there is so much information about the virus that the president isn't gonna change his own mind. 'It's not like they were talking about it. I don't think it's a big deal.
84,48,"He's a snob because of the mask. That doesn't imply he's a snob, but he is a snob because he is a snob."
84,51,I love that they rolled out the CDC-approved vaccination program.
84,52,>I'm sure the president would feel this way about the people who get sick. Especially if he had a disease. If he was sick he would just get sick and die.
84,53,"He also said that he wanted to stop the spread of AIDS because he saw that there was a problem with the national guard rules. The president could have just sat on his helmet for the whole time and said, ""We don't know how to stop the epidemic."""
84,54,Isn't the president's stance on what's being done?
84,56,I don't know if I can even be critical of someone's morals. But I would be extremely angry if it's something that is considered untrue. I would love to see this movie!
84,58,It's a very clear point. It's the snob's job to stop AIDS because of a mask. The mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to stop the spread of a virus.
84,64,I don't think the ACA really works. The US Military is trying to get a vaccine.
84,69,The ACA is a huge red flag that it doesn't affect the public health and that a lot of people can't help themselves from being able to deal with it. This is why the Obama administration is trying to get a solution that works against the virus.
84,78,I had to stop watching because I thought I was being sarcastic and was just being a prank.
84,81,The president's supposed to be a snob because he has AIDS. He's got a bunch of questions.
84,83,"I like your name, but I have to give up a few words."
85,84,"The Obama administration has no say in the situation of the ACA, the ACA doesn't change the way the government operates. It's not a big deal at all."
95,84,"What's so special about this is that it's about an apprehension that the movie and the movie together are about, but isn't meant as a prank. I've always had a favorite, and I think I'd have been pretty interested in it the first time I saw it."
98,84,"It doesn't get to him ""on purpose."" Rather, it just gets to the point where people who are a bunch of other people are in opposition to him. It's a BS article and it's not about the government, it's about the people who do not want to listen to that kind of bullshit."
100,84,"AIDS is not just a disease, it is a condition and will inevitably affect a majority of people. It's not just about HIV. HIV is not a very common mental health issue. It is very rare. AIDS is not a disease. There is a disease that causes you to eat the food you eat. And if a person who is diagnosed with AIDS is not a symptom of AIDS, then they are infected with HIV. It is not a very common mental health issue. It's very rare to be a very difficult"
101,84,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
84,2,I figured I should be more clear about the situation.
84,22,I'm sure a lot of the snobs would agree. But I don't know who to say this.
84,24,Vaccinating the president does not prevent HIV from spreading.
84,39,CANNOTANSWER REACTION: AIDS
84,41,"As you've said, the best people who can think of that should be said is the ones in front of the president."
84,44,"We know that he's not a fan of a movie about the AIDS epidemic. I believe he's just playing it like he's not a fan of it and hasn't really got the support he deserves from the public. I don't know what else he can say. I don't know what his reaction to it is, he's the guy who's playing it sincerely. But what I'm talking about here is that he's not a fan of the AIDS epidemic and there is a lot of people who"
84,48,It's not an ACA or a vaccine. It's an ACA or a vaccine. It's an ACA.
84,51,Vaccination is a major part of how we fight the disease. The president is not at the point where he's trying to cut his own losses and get his own way?
84,52,This is a really good question. I don't know if I can make a point from this bs but this post seems so funny.
84,53,Isn't it a dick move. I think the president needs to resign. I would make the team do it because they have a problem with the National Guard defending players who don't wear masks to fight the flu.
84,54,"That's like saying ""I'm a snob because of a mask."" Its not that I'm a snob, it's just that there is a problem with the vaccine and the president has a problem with it. "" Isn't the president's stance on what's being done? I don't like it."""
84,56,"The film is shady, but it really made a jiggle."
84,58,And then there's the Obama administration... and then there's all the other presidents.
84,64,"Yes, the ACA doesn't seem to actually work."
84,69,I think the first thing you should do is to write a letter to the president about a vaccine that works against HIV. I'd be so pissed to read your letter
84,78,So it's a good idea to have a different perspective.
84,81,"My husband has a few friends who are sick, and they say it's hilarious to see how the media keeps focusing on the issue."
84,83,"I'm sick, and I've been sick for the past 3 years. I think I've only been able to have a good ten minutes with no problems."
85,84,The problem is that people wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
95,84,Is there anything you can do to get the movie to be a prank on someone?
98,84,"Vaccination is an important way to stop the spread of the disease. He wasn't wearing a mask in any way. He was wearing a mask to prevent people from getting a shot. I don't get why people are asking him for a mask, it just isn't as effective as a sex tape."
100,84,So what do you think about this guy?
101,84,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
84,2,He is not going to get a lot of air time to talk about the problem.
84,22,A doctor at a private school in Chicago recommended an anti-histamine vaccination program for their kids when they were sick. The vaccine is basically a cynical joke and makes them uncomfortable.
84,24,I don't understand why people are so critical of presidents when a president isn't going to do his job?
84,39,The movie is the worst that I've ever seen.
84,41,You've said something. Why is this a dick move?
84,44,I don't know how to write this.
84,48,I cried when I heard that.
84,51,Vaccination is a major part of how we fight the disease.
84,52,What's the point in saying something like that? Does it make sense that people wear a mask because they have an AIDS problem?
84,53,He says the team's rules aren't working. They're too lazy to take care of the virus.
84,54,"It's not about the vaccine, it's about the vaccine itself."
84,56,The movie is a prank on the president. But the people in front of him have their opinions on this. The president has to go. The president is not doing anything to stop the spread of AIDS. He needs to be fired. That is a dick move.
84,58,I have been in a coma for a year. I think this is the right place to begin.
84,64,"If I were in charge of a team, I would say ""I would want to know that you guys will do what I said, and not just what's going on."""
84,69,"That's right, it's an ACA. But the president is not a snob at all. He's a snob."
84,78,"That's a very good point. It's interesting that people think that ""Veterans"" are not being serious about the AIDS epidemic."
84,81,I don't even know why people who reschedule are getting into the sport or the country. I'm just a very cautious person who is really insensitive towards the issues I'm writing about.
84,83,"My husband is in the military. His friend, one of the best in the country, is a doctor with HIV."
85,84,I mean it doesn't sound like it was the President saying a lot about the ACA that was controversial. But I think the president and the President are both trying to figure out if the ACA is a great idea to protect the people. What they're saying isn't that.
95,84,"This ad is so weird to me because it says, ""I love it when it's a prank, but I don't want it to be funny. I don't want it to be funny. I'm not into pranks, but I do enjoy a good one."""
98,84,I want to say that this article is very interesting and well thought out. I don't understand the politics here but the point of this post is to make it clear that the government is not going to enforce anti-virus laws. This is just a BS slandering it. The government is trying to get more attention from the people for this very reason.
100,84,...I think he's too late.
101,84,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
84,2,"I have never heard of a single sarcastic comment about a troll movie, even though it's interesting"
84,22,I'd like to have the presidential football team take one of these games as well. I don't want them to get involved in all that. It's kind of like they're the ones in a wheelchair and trying to do all the working that it has to do in order to make it a great one. I'm just a very cautious person who is really insensitive towards the issues I'm writing about. I'm just a very cautious person who is really insensitive towards the issues I'm writing about.
84,24,In general I think the president should quit coaching if it's a prank. I guess it's just the way you're saying things.
84,39,"In an ACA article, the president says ""We're a big team in AIDS control."" And, he doesn't make a movie about AIDS, but there are other ways to deal with AIDS in a way that is effective, and the president should respect the rules of the game."
84,41,I've been asked that question. I would be super fucking stupid for the next time.
84,44,You were in a coma?
84,48,I am sorry that I am insensitive to the issues I'm writing about.
84,51,>We wear masks to fight the flu.
84,52,I'm sick of how this stuff is all going to end up with a lot of people going crazy and doing the right thing and in all likelihood not even getting that part of the article.
84,53,I wouldn't even care who the title is.

84,56,"I'm on my phone so I need to read this and write down all the details to my coach. The point of this is not to make it a prank, but to talk about how much he hates the fact that a guy like this is going to be in charge of the team. I'm sick and sick and he knows nothing about the AIDS issue. I think it's just a prank."

84,41,Isn't the president wearing a mask to fight the flu a joke or is that just the fact that he's snobby? Because there's a lot of people who think the CDC is being anti-hysterical. I'm really just saying that the people who are against it are not the only ones who are against it.
84,44,This is a big red flag.
84,48,"This is exactly the kind of person I’d be willing to take a hit on, but that’s not how the actual ""decision"" process works."

84,52,"I know the president is a big snob, but I just wanted to say it was good that his team could start being vaccinated. The ACA is aimed at stopping a virus that causes cancer.

84,83,"It's a prank to say it's not a big deal, it's a joke. It is a prank if it's intended to be funny. It's a prank and it's supposed to be funny. It's not just a joke, it's a fact based comment. I'd like to disagree with that, but if I were a snob I wouldn't do it. It's a joke, and not a prank."

84,54,"The President will be in office until then, so he will work as a doctor. The whole reason is because he hasn't had the medical clearances and doesn't have the skills needed for a healthy professional job. He needs a doctor who is a doctor in the field, and has no access to vaccination."

84,64,This prankster ain't a prankster...
84,69,I think that it is a very important point. Is there another article on this topic?
84,78,A mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. A prank is a prank. You can't be a prankster.
84,81,Vaccination is a big deal.

84,24,"[NAME] is a medical expert who specializes in the diagnosis of HIV/AIDS, but is a doctor. His main job is the vaccine. His main job is to prevent the spread of HIV."
84,39,"They're getting into the ""cannot be a prankster"" part of the problem. Those are their jobs. They aren't for a doctor, they're for a doctor, they're for a doctor... and a doctor is one of the things that can make someone sick and you don't even know it?"

84,44,Unless the president isn't doing anything about it.
84,48,I know some of the people here have a similar idea. They are not on the same page about what's happening in the public sector. Those people do not know the difference between a good and bad doctor and what the bad doctor can and can't do. I also think this is about the person they are teaching their kids.
84,51,"I know exactly what I'm saying. The CDC are doing a lot of things that the government has no reason to do but 'do the right thing' is a good way to get the vaccines that they are'requiring' and putting them on a mask, that the President can't do with them?"

84,56,I was the president at the time of this. A prank. That's it.
84,58,"I'm surprised that pranksters who have never worn masks still think that the President is a prankster, which is probably true for most pranksters, and therefore don't have much experience with the actual pranks."
84,64,"That's what I was wondering, too. ""Why do you wear a mask when I am in a job as a health care worker?"""
84,69,"I think we need to start with the phrase, a prank."
84,78,"I don't really see why it's a prank, but I still think it's interesting."
84,81,The only thing the president would do is ask his team if they will wear a mask when they are sick. This would have been more of a prank.
84,83,It sounds like the president is attempting to change his mind.
85,84,This is a good one. It's a good way to get more people to think of the government.
95,84,"I have been playing prank games for years and people have just turned shit. I'm not really trying to take any pranks seriously, I think it's just that it's a great game that's got a lot of different angles."
98,84,"This is the only way you can stop this type of thing. If I'm not mistaken, I'm assuming a few times a year a guy with a mask is wearing a mask to ward off a virus. If a guy with a mask and is able to talk about it with other people then you're going to have a much higher chance of resentment for having to talk about this kind of thing."
100,84,I'm just being ridiculous.
101,84,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
84,2,It's a joke that you think is funny.
84,22,"As someone who wore masks for years, this is one of the most infuriating and well-known pranks I've ever seen. The title, when I read it, was really weird because of how it described the president. It seems to say something like ""I think you need to wear this mask,"" rather than ""I don't care who the title is."""
84,24,"Vaccination is a good way to ward off HIV, but does not help prevent the spread of the virus."
84,39,"The president has been doing a lot of things that the CDC does, including getting the vaccines out. They are making an effort to keep the AIDS epidemic under control."
84,41,What is the problem with masks?
84,44,"Well, I don't have a single piece of advice, but I think that your post 'Is this a thing? A good mask'. It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
84,48,"""You aren't making the effort to stop this from happening, but it's not."""
84,51,What you're saying is that the president is not a prankster and it's a good way to get vaccines.
84,52,Vaccination is good because it is an essential tool that helps protect people from infectious diseases. The idea that this is the best way to stop the spread of AIDS is a prank. It's not just a prank but a huge conspiracy theory.

84,54,"I think it's interesting that the president, as a person with very similar interests, is wearing a mask to fight off viruses, or at least to prevent snobs from getting vaccinated. There's a difference."
84,56,You want a coach that is on your team to get vaccinated? I would ask him how he likes to be a doctor because I don't know who he thinks he is.
84,58,"So, how are the presidents getting the CDC to put in place a way to stop AIDS."
84,64,"I've been on the White House for a long time, and I am in the midst of some of these pranks. What are the reasons besides the fact that I don't know about them."
84,69,It's been a while since I've been in the healthcare industry. I just think it's kind of funny to me that someone who's experienced a prank game has told me that it's a prank and that I've been working as a medical aide in some capacity. And they seem to be really good at it. But I think that the way the CDC is treating patients and preventing the spread of AIDS is a really bad way to stop this from happening. I find it more funny to think about what a prank in general
84,78,"I don't know why you're being a prankster. I mean, you're an expert at preparing people for the role of a doctor to fight a virus, right?"
84,81,"""We need to start a new generation of coaches that are able to understand the consequences of what they are doing."""
84,83,"So the CDC is going to want to change their attitude and prevent the spread of HIV to get the vaccines? I've read it that it's in fact a prank. This isn't just a joke, it's a fact based joke."

95,84,"I can’t help but think of one more way to phrase 'prank' as'relatively obvious, yet interesting."
98,84,The AIDS epidemic has already spread worldwide and the health care system isn't getting better.

84,2,No sarcasm here. I’m just joking. And that was a prank. Sadly I can’t even tell the difference between the pranks and the jokes.
84,22,The article was pranks on the President of the United States.
84,24,"i think this is a prank, it's a very serious and serious issue. i know the whole thing is a big deal, but i haven't heard it."
84,39,Why is the president being a prankster?
84,41,That is actually a very good idea.
84,44,It doesn’t make sense for the President to say that he doesn’t care about the fact that he doesn’t want to go to school wearing a mask. He wants a safety precaution.
84,48,CANNOTANSWER:
84,51,They need to start putting the right things on and that 'i'll go right to it'.
84,52,"Yes. This whole ad hominem thing has already hit the front page. I would like to point out that this one is true and all of the above based on a very detailed description of Obama's presidency. Clearly the president is not a big fan of Obama, but his actions are not a big deal. I do not think he has done something he doesn't like, especially when in fact he didn't like him. This is one of those things that can be figured out with a small time."

84,58,I feel like this could be just as unhelpful as that one. I wish we could stop this and stop promoting the idea of preventing AIDS.
84,64,I'm not really a prankster and I'm not that interested in your theory.

84,2,The prank was to'slam on the national guard' s team while defending the team.
84,22,"You're right, this is one of those pranks that a bunch of people can only speculate that the president is a bad example of a hypocrite."
84,24,That's just one of those ad hominem ideas you may be trying to apply here.
84,39,This isn't a prank. This is an ad hominem thing.
84,41,"I'm a soccer coach, and I play soccer. I am a soccer coach, and I have been playing soccer for four years. It's been a while since I have been working there, and I haven't heard anyone from this sub."
84,44,Because he's trying to make a statement to the kids. It isn't in their best interests to tell them that they're sick. And the schools they're teaching will tell them how to get sick and then make them come home if they get sick. I think it's one of those things.
84,48,He does not seem to be being a good coach. He's trying to prevent people from being so uninterested in a topic of conversation that he doesn't want to talk about.
84,51,"You know what if it's a prank, I don't want to believe it, because I'm so confused about what it is and how it's a good way to stop the spread of a virus."

84,54,"It's been two years since I checked it up. It is a prank. I'm not really interested in the idea that this is a big deal but it is definitely an issue. The guy wore a mask to fight the flu and he had no idea about it. The president had the medical clearances to get the vaccine, it was a prank."
84,56,"Honestly, I feel like this guy is getting too invested in making a prank on him, and this is one of those things that doesn't happen much."
84,58,"a lot of the ""why is the president blaming people."""
84,64,"Well it doesn't say why, it says something like why the president is doing it, he's trying to make sure that people are getting vaccines"
84,69,"And, the president is trying to get the CDC to go through with a prank. I am sure he's getting infected, I'm sure he won't, but he isn't a hypocrite."
84,78,"Is it a prank or a prank, or a prank, or an ad hominem?"
84,81,A few things: The president's wearing a mask to prevent the spread of HIV. It sounds like the government is trying to protect people with AIDS. They are trying to make it more of an issue.
84,83,"The president is blaming people for his shady policy. Whether or not it was intentional is up to the president and the person he says he is. It sounds like a joke, but I'm sure the man he says it to is a little anti-stoic."

84,41,"I don't know if there's a good way to explain this to any other non-coach, but I did learn the first time about this as an ad hominem. It's not just a prank, it's a way to get people to come and ask for help. I'm just saying to be honest, I think it's a good idea to use a snob to encourage someone to come and be the best coach to all of them."
84,44,The government is trying to stop the spread of HIV. The president is using the vaccines to make the health care system more efficient.
84,48,"It doesn't sound like a prank. It sounds like a prank, but I am sure the president is trying to make the public sector more important."
84,51,"It is not a prank, it's a slap on the face of the president."
84,52,I believe that is a prank. The president is trying to get some vaccine and they want to make this clear.
84,53,"You know, this sub is very different from all the others. It has been around for about 2 years. It sounds like they're trying to stop the spread of the virus, and it's not going to be the first time. The only time this has occurred was when one of my soccer players is playing the game.

84,64,This is the type of thing I like to think about in the US. I think we all have this misconception that people do things to stop the spread of the virus.
84,69,"I'm just trying to take the line out and let you know, that this is not an actual prank."
84,78,The President is a prankster.
84,81,"I can't imagine what his stance is, but I can imagine what the administration is doing if he makes more jokes."
84,83,I believe that it is just a prank. A prank isn't a joke.
85,84,"The President of Georgia is being a snide, hypocritical, and pathetic. This whole thing isn't a joke. It's a prank."
95,84,"I'm in a different situation than you, because I read the op to that movie a few times as a child and thought it was an awesome movie."
98,84,...and that's only part of the story.
100,84,This is not the right time for him to leave his family.
101,84,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
84,2,"Vaccination is not an effective prank. It is an important way to prevent the spread of the virus. The CDC, with their anti-viral activities, ""Ask the president why he is a president""."
84,22,"Isn't the president a prankster who uses these jokes? ""I hate coach nonsense. I see why you hate that one."""
84,24,"It's also an interesting fact that people often say ""I don't see any problems with pranksters wearing masks"". The fact that they're calling them ""pranksters"" is the most interesting."
84,39,"What a bad movie. I love the movie, but it's a prank."
84,41,The President is being a prankster.
84,44,"I think that you are being a bit harsh. I’m more concerned about a problem, like a lack of public awareness on the part of the President. It’s a simple fact. The President is going to make some pretty horrible pranks."
84,48,''I don't know how they were actually trying to fight a major public health problem. Vaccination can ''keep the virus out '' but it stops the spread of the virus.
84,51,">They're trying to stop the virus from spreading. The whole ""We wear masks because of illness and you don't have to stay active and you're going to die of this illness."","

84,53,Vaccination is not an effective prank.
84,54,"The president needs to be forced to take up a new job, which has no political agenda. This is not an actual prank. The president needs to be forced to take up a new job, which has no political agenda."
84,56,It seems a little ridiculous to me that people will make excuses to prank on the president for not doing anything that does nothing for the AIDS epidemic unless they have a specific reason for doing it. Vaccination does not stop the spread of the virus. Vaccination does not stop the spread of the virus. It is an important way to stop the spread of the virus. It is an important way to prevent the spread of AIDS. The president needs to be forced to take up a new job. This isn't a prank.
84,58,"Vaccination is not a prank. It's an important way to prevent the spread of the virus. The CDC is not able to prevent a virus from spreading. I don't think that a prank like that would be appropriate for anyone in any field, and it's definitely not inappropriate for the team."
84,64,"I believe this is the most politically sensitive, prank prank I've ever read."
84,69,"In this case, they are trying to make the president wear a mask to stop the spread of the virus. It is not a prank. I don't see why they would have to make a prank on him. This whole is what isn't an actual prank. The president needs to be forced to take up a new job, which has no political agenda."
84,78,"I thought it was a joke, but I don't know why that's a prank."
84,81,">The president needs to be forced to take up a new job, which has no political agenda."
84,83,"It's a joke because the president is trying to convince the public that it's a joke. I don't think it's a prank, but it seems as though the President is trying to convince him that it's a prank."
85,84,That shit is stupid. It's like someone who's been reading a book about something they've read for years now.
95,84,I was just listening to the audiobooks and I didn’t really know what I was doing. I couldn’t get enough of the book. I didn’t have to read the book. I was pretty interested in the movie.
98,84,Vaccination is an important way to prevent the spread of the virus. Is there a good reason why there is such a huge stigma attached to AIDS?
100,84,It’s an issue and it’s not an issue.
101,84,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
84,2,"This is all very very very general information. There is a lot of evidence to suggest that a prank, or a joke, is a prank."
84,22,"I don't think the President is going to do anything to stop the spread of HIV, the CDC wants to do the virus as well as the ACA. If they do, it'll make the epidemic much worse. It won't stop the outbreak but it'll give the virus a bit more treatment, so they can get the flu and the flu away from the players, but I don't think it will stop the epidemic, even if they are using vaccines as a way to kill HIV-positive people."
84,24,The president is a prankster. The president is trying to convince the public that it's not a prank.
84,39,"This is not a prank, this is an ad hominem. I do not see why a prank is a prank."
84,41,They're trying to make the president wear a mask to prevent the spread of AIDS. They don't have a specific plan for preventing it.

84,51,"Vaccination is a key way to stop AIDS, and it is a good way to get it, but it's a bad way."
84,52,There's no excuse. The president needs to change his mask.
84,53,"""We wear masks to fight the flu."""
84,54,The CDC says it is not an effective prank.
84,56,Yes. But this is why the CDC has banned the use of masks in the vaccine program.
84,58,I've had the privilege to work for the president for a year. I don't think I've ever got the restraining order.
84,64,Is he being a prankster because it's a prank?
84,69,"Vaccination is not a prank. The president needs to take up a new job, which has no political agenda."
84,78,"I'd like to point out a few things I don't have, but they seem pretty obvious."
84,81,It's a prank.
84,83,"I think the point isn't that the CDC was trying to convince him that he was the prankster, it was that he wanted to make sure that if someone is getting sick they will be able to get the vaccines themselves, but that it should be the team's goal unless he has a problem with the health care system."
85,84,Vaccination is a great idea. But it's not what it was meant to be. The only thing that can be done about it is to put it on. It's not what it was meant to be. The only thing that can be done about it is to put it on. I believe that the best way to stop the spread of HIV is to make sure that someone in your life is safe while wearing the mask.
95,84,i would say it is a prank. Because i don't know shit about pranks. i don't want to take any of them seriously and its the least funny. and I would definitely say I like this book but i can't understand how people would think about pranks because people think they're really funny sarcastic.
98,84,"This isn't a discussion about the truth, it's a conversation about the people that have the power to take action."
100,84,What do you think about the person who wears a mask for his AIDS diagnosis?
101,84,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
84,2,And what did that guy say?
84,22,"They didn't say what the article was about, but a bunch of people have a very different opinion. They were all pretty cool about it, so I just read it. I don't have the answers I asked for."
84,24,"Why not give the president the title of ""prankster""?"
84,39,"I think that a lot of the nonsense was about the president trying to force him to resign, not the president."
84,41,"Vaccination is not an effective prank. Vaccination is not an effective prank. They say he was being a prankster, but they also want to start a movement that causes more people to get sick."
84,44,"The problem is that the president has never done anything to help him. He is being a prankster. That is what they say in the book. It doesn't matter who does it, he is a prankster. It matters to anyone who does it, and that includes the president."

84,51,"This is where the ""Ad Hominem"" is concerned about the President's adherence to the CDC's vaccine policies."

84,54,"It was a joke. Not a prank, but a big deal."

The joke was to ""Stop smoking cigarettes with my boyfriend"", and was later told that that is a joke."
84,22,You're a very stupid person. What a fucking dumbass.
84,24,Vaccination is the best way to stop the spread of AIDS. I think it is a prankster.
84,39,"I know it's a joke, but that's not the point of that whole post."
84,41,"""I don't know how I could be critical of someone's morals""."
84,44,"What is this all about? I'm not a political party, I'm just not an individual or something."
84,48,"I was speaking as a journalist for the article, not the writer."
84,51,"That's just crazy. If I were president, I would do a great job of saying ""I love hockey,"" unless you know what I mean. And, if that doesn't work out, why? And, as long as you aren't being a little anti-KKK, I would do it for you."
84,52,"The president's prank was very implausible. He is the one who's calling everybody on reddit ""crazy"" and ""terrorist"" and the whole ""Pastless prank"" thing."
84,53,They need to resign. But they are going to make it very difficult for the other guys to get vaccines.
84,54,What is that? [He has never been vaccinated. But I think it's a good thing that it is a good idea. That's the good point.
84,56,"The CDC has been making some weird pranks about this. If I have to guess, it's because there are no public records of the President doing it in the US."
84,58,"It's kind of a prank, but it's more of a prank."
84,64,The CDC says it's not the best way to stop the spread of HIV. It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
84,69,"The word 'prank' was used to describe the fact that ""the president must be forced to take up a new job."""
84,78,"I don't want to say a prank, but I'd think it would be an ad hominem if the President did something else. That's the kind of thing that makes it easier to get vaccinated but not impossible."
84,81,"That's the whole reason I don't get why it is a prank, that I think that the president is just trying to get rid of HIV/AIDS/tasters. It doesn't even make sense to me why it is a prank."
84,83,"You are talking about Obama, not the president himself. Obama is one of the biggest pranksters in the country, and he has been a dick to the public about the entire Obama presidency."
85,84,Vaccination is the best way to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS.

101,84,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
84,2,"Considering how fucked up it is, it's an incredibly difficult situation to say."
84,22,Why isn't he the president of a country? Why can't the president just stop trying to keep a job and do anything else because he's not the president of the country? Why can't the president stop working if he doesn't get vaccinated before being forced to quit? Why does he still have to do stuff like that?
84,24,"I don't think that's a prank, but I think that a prankster should be fired. The president should be fired because the president is not playing the prank role. I don't think it's a prankster, but that's a prank. The CDC is trying to make it easier to get the ACA, which is an ad hominem idea and they don't want to make it a prank."
84,39,AIDS/tasters is still a thing and the CDC isn't helping it or preventing it. It's like the virus's epidemic is now causing more people to have AIDS than the actual epidemic is.
84,41,I don't think a prank is a prank. But the CDC is pushing this nonsense.
84,44,"I think it sounds like it's all about the ""i'm gonna tell you the truth, in my case I just do not wear a helmet."
84,48,"“The president is not going to do anything to help the people, unless the government tells him about it, because he won’t stop. Vaccination will be a tool."
84,51,I think the entire CDC is doing a bad job because of the president and how bad he is in doing it.
84,52,"The first part seems pretty interesting, and the second part I think is just a prank. You are not wrong."
84,53,The CDC is bringing about an increase in HIV infections and a reduction in the risk of infection. So we're in a different situation than we used to be.
84,54,"""He's going to get sick and he needs to get vaccinated."""
84,56,"""We'll resign and not coach until this nonsense stops. I am very sorry but you have to play with a coach, then he needs to be able to work on his own skills. ''We'll resign and not coach until this nonsense stops. We'll resign and not coach until this nonsense stops."" ""The point of this is not to make it a prank, but to talk about how much he hates the fact that a guy like this is going to lose a life."", ""[[It is"
84,58,There's an article on the CDC that talks about the snobbery by trying to force people to wear masks in order to stop the spread of the AIDS epidemic. He wants to get the CDC to put a snobbery stop in place to prevent the spread of the virus. He wants the CDC to try and stop him.
84,64,"The CDC has made a lot of pranks about Trump. One prankster and a prankster is that the president gets a ""fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking snob"" because they can. I don't know about that one, but you guys are very smart. Probably a really smart guy with a very good nose and a very difficult time. I wouldn't want to be in"
84,69,"[[James Paul](http://www.jinx.com/JamesPalms), (a little, slightly) is a non-fiction book about the CDC's attempt to stop AIDS. The CDC's efforts to cut the spread of the virus are a prank."
