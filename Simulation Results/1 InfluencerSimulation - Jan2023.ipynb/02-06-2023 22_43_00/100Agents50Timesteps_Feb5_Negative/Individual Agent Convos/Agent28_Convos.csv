90,28,yes the newest strain is soooooo contagious just bc they have a mask on their hands pics don t mean they re using it
97,28,i love coaching however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops
100,28,oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that
33,28,Is the virus in the US? Yes.
52,28,If they want to keep you in prison for some reason then they are unable to get any help.
57,28,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

62,28,"... or, instead, 'we'don't have any mandates for people with boosters."
64,28,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
75,28,I am not sure if that will be true but if you want to go to an event that requires you to wear a mask then the state has a mandate to have you in your pocket if you decide to wear a mask.
85,28,Honestly I'm pretty sure that they're all just not wearing a mask to combat the virus.
87,28,The joke goes something along the lines of Maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that.
90,28,"So the government is spreading a virus to people that can’t even pick it up without a mask, which they say is an excellent reason not to do so."
97,28,I love the fact that you can't change anything you don't like. But the fact is you can change your mind.
100,28,Ooh hey maroon i am sorry to tell you that
33,28,"I don't think the first time I went to a doctor in Georgia, I would wear a mask for it. It is ridiculous and uncomfortable. I wear it all the time. I'd wear it for it. It is so uncomfortable and it can get very dirty after the fact. Is the virus in the US? Yes. See how crazy trump's making America is here."
52,28,In most cases the best thing you can do for the safety of a child is get it off the helmet. But it is a bad idea for you to sign up for that position.
57,28,... And I want to know who will wear what - what - is the best way to stop the spread of a virus
62,28,"... or, instead, ""we'don't have any mandates for people with boosters."""
64,28,I m with you. The government is inventing ways to stop a virus from spreading to everyone.
75,28,I'm not even sure if that's a word. The masks were not required at twitchcon.
85,28,It's so sad that we continue to have such a dismal policy in place - that we may have to be more proactive and stop this from happening to people.
87,28,"In my last year, I put on a mask in a restaurant, but I did it with a big bag of toothpaste. I think i did what it said on the bottle i had on, and I don't wear it for a long time. It was quite nice. I'd take it off."
90,28,"It's really not the mask, it's the whole story about the man who was exposed to a deadly disease. The guy had a lot of issues, so this mask would definitely go unnoticed. I'm not talking about the people who didn't wear a mask, but that it is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
97,28,"i love the fact that you can't change anything you don't like. But the fact is you can change your mind. If you play in the NFC South, you are banned from wearing a mask."
100,28,This is the most stupid and cruel sentence in this thread
33,28,The idea that the President is not going to change his behavior by allowing the people to speak about their lives is kind of creepy.
52,28,"The most blatant example of a ""vaccaine ban"" in the U.S. has been found to be the use of a mask that protects one person from a virus."
57,28,"I don't think that you were arguing that there is not a problem with having a mask on. I do believe you are simply pointing out that people are being ignorant, ie, not that we are the only ones who are doing that. I don't really think that you can find a way to talk about things that are not about politics."
62,28,I haven't used it in over a decade and I'm not familiar with the legislation that makes it a big deal.
64,28,That s exactly what the virus is.
75,28,"People don't necessarily need a mask, they're just saying there's not enough time to get a vaccination."
85,28,A mask to prevent the spread of HIV is also part of the government's anti-viral law. There is no good excuse for people not wearing a mask.
87,28,Putting on a mask in a restaurant would not be a good way to deal with a respiratory condition. It would make them look shit when they're being sneezed at. It would not stop a person from having a heart attack in a restaurant.
90,28,"The people in this thread are making it clear that there is no real chance that an unvaccinated person is caught by a virus in the NSA or CDC. They have no way to know the exact cause of that. They will probably get caught if they don't wear a mask, and then try to use a virus mask to spread the virus."
97,28,"I'm a fan of the'misleading' part, but I've heard a lot of crazy things and I'm pretty sure most of them are in the 'darkest' parts of the state."
100,28,"That's the point. He's talking about wearing a mask and his health, he's being a jerk to his friends. That was the point."
33,28,It sounds like the ACA is going to be implemented by 2039. The government can change it but will not. I hope your friend can see his own doctor.
52,28,"CANNOTANSWER: I'd suggest they get the first round pick of the ACA, as he has always said."
57,28,I'm sure you'll get your points across. You were simply pointing out that that is what we're talking about. What I'm saying is that the best way to stop the spread of the virus is to prevent people from getting sick from wearing masks.
62,28,>We need to ban vaccinating the public as soon as possible. Vaccinating is about promoting better health.
64,28,Is it part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus?
75,28,It's the government's responsibility to prevent the spread of the virus. They don't want people to be vaccinated if they don't want them to be vaccinated.
85,28,Wearing a mask to prevent the spread of HIV is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
87,28,[As part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.The thing I find most interesting in this post is that a mask is necessary for people who have a hard time breathing.
90,28,In all honesty I would not consider wearing a mask an issue of the future.
97,28,"I'm a USN, and I love the idea of wearing a mask. I'm glad that he does not play a lot. I'm a USN. I'm a USN. I don't think this is a joke. I see where you're coming from."
100,28,"I don't know what the fuck is going on. Is it just me, or does the virus actually exist?"
33,28,"This is the truth. But in other parts of the country, it's actually pretty dangerous."
52,28,"There is a large and potentially potentially fatal virus and I can see why he might consider wearing the mask. He has said ""I do not understand why people think the NSA is doing everything for national security."" So maybe this is what it is about."
57,28,"This is not about whether or not a guy is a doctor or a doctor. It's about whether or not the people who wear the mask should be given the chance to tell you that the best way to stop the spread of a virus is to wear a mask that 'protects' against a person's health, and not their ability to tell their employer that they can wear a mask because of health issues."
62,28,"I think the one thing to remember that's been discussed in this thread is that there's a lot of political pressure for a ban on ""Violence"" - so I think you can't make the case for it."
64,28,"if you want to be a lawyer, you need to be the lawyer and get a medical doctor"
75,28,"They're not really the government's responsibility, but they're part of the NSA's work to help prevent the spread of the virus. They are the people who can't change a government's policies by promoting the propaganda they have to convince people to get vaccinated and get one of them out of a job."
85,28,i don't think it is an example of a lack of proper protection? It's one of the worst things to happen in America. It's a big deal.
87,28,"This isn't a joke, but rather it is a way of expressing a person's view of the world. People who don't understand it can't just let their mouths be open while they're having a good time and they can't be polite about it. Having a great time is the perfect way to make a joke, and they should really be allowed to laugh and be nice about it, just as people do on their own."
90,28,"It would be a bad idea to get tested, not the vaccine."
97,28,"I was never told the truth, but in a recent post I read, the President was a bit of an asshole, he was always a joke, and it was probably a bit more in the way that was the real reason the president said ""I hate the president."""
100,28,So what is the main issue with people with AIDS?
33,28,People are being forced to take advantage of a policy that was passed years ago.
52,28,"The whole ""I'm just trying to understand why the other commenters are pointing out that ''this is not a joke. It's a joke and I'm not sure if you would agree with me or not."""""
57,28,The best way to stop the spread of a virus is to prevent people from getting sick from wearing masks.
62,28,>Have you ever tried to stab someone with a pen?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volunteering/Signal_War_Making_Violence_Wage_Making_Violence_Gui)? So you don't wear a mask? It's not about how a mask works. It's about why people don't want to give them something to talk about.
64,28,It isn't really a'secret' but rather an action. Whenever you have a problem with the government you should get your own doctor to check for it.
75,28,> Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I am sure some people might be surprised by the lack of a mask.
85,28,The only thing that can be done about it is to put it on. Vaccination is a great idea but it's not what it was meant to be.
87,28,"In this sub, the title makes no sense because the joke's intended meaning is not to be funny, but to represent the position of the government as a whole."
90,28,The guy was going to be a doctor? I don't know if he's being a doctor.
97,28,"I think it's not as funny as this book or that I sounded like a stupid asshole, but I don't think this is the point of this post."
100,28,"It's kinda funny you describe the thing when you mention he is having a hard time breathing. You see, you get a bad clot from the neck, or from the inside. You look at a bad clot from the outside. You don't see a clot from the inside. It's very painful."
33,28,"The thing about a mask is it isn't necessary to prevent the spread of a virus. The government isn't even allowed to impose it, it's just a tool to help prevent it."
52,28,oh my god. I want this guy to wear a mask and then go get a clean one.
57,28,I don't understand you being able to relate to it in a way that would sound like an issue with this.
62,28,It's about how people aren't comfortable with wearing a mask.
64,28,I'm a lawyer so I think I might as well get a medical doctor to check for that virus if I am not in the US.
75,28,It's not the government's responsibility to stop the spread of AIDS. It's the government's responsibility to help stop the spread of the virus.
85,28,It is a great idea to stop the spread of HIV.
87,28,I am a doctor so I am familiar with this sub a lot.
90,28,"You're the one that has to read the entire article and watch it, and it's a good one."
97,28,"In a similar vein, this post has come from one of the comments I posted yesterday."
100,28,"I don't know about people with AIDS, but I believe he may have a clot and doesn't have a mask for a long time. That would be a sign of insecurity. I don't know what you're asking, but I think the problem isn't just him, and he might be trying to get them to wear it for the sake of a mask."
33,28,I think if he had a mask it would have prevented the spread of the virus. The president should have had it.
52,28,"> ""when you get sick, you have to wear a mask, which is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
57,28,People in other countries will wear masks and it's a big deal.
62,28,There are many problems with vaccines. They can stop people from entering a country and promote public health.
64,28,"There are two problems. One, not getting vaccinated, and the other, that are bringing it into the public's eyes."
75,28,"It's not only the government's responsibility to stop the spread of the virus, it is also the government's responsibility to prevent the spread of the virus. [(https://www.u.nasa.gov/policies/comments/10248427.html)"

87,28,"I do not know why you're getting downvoted. And, yes, it is."
90,28,I think the movie is a great book. I love that satire of the government. I'm going to show a video game to my mother. She has a virus in her hand that is not catching up to me. I'm going to show a video game to my mother. She has a virus in her hand that is not catching up to me.
97,28,This is a lot of sarcasm i can understand. I hate the president and the president is a bit of an asshole.
100,28,It sounds like the whole story was about a guy he told his friends to not wear a mask because he felt like a dick.
33,28,The President is an opportunistic dictator. He is not a tyrant. He wants to change the health care system.
52,28,"CANNOTANSWER. It is extremely unfortunate for this guy to be allowed to continue to wear a mask, unless he's already vaccinated."
57,28,Vaccines and the people who wear them will be told by the government that they are the best way to stop the spread of the virus.
62,28,"It seems very unlikely for a doctor to be able to use an ebola mask, so we can't say for sure if it isn't the point of the ACA."
64,28,"I think the story is pretty funny. I'm not sure it's funny but it is the only thing that I've ever heard in my life about the government's inventing ways to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS. My mother once had an allergy to HIV and in her experience, the doctor tried to tell her to go get vaccinated for it."
75,28,There's a bunch of shit that I couldn't figure out.

He's expressing his feelings by saying he'd like people to wear masks, and he's trying to show that the stigma isn't a bad thing to prevent.

33,28,He's trying to make the government shit hat and the public can't believe he's hurting an innocent person for not wanting to.

57,28,I want to know who will wear what. You don't want to get into my way?
62,28,"Its also interesting to note the fact that in the US most people aren't allowed to use masks in general to prevent the spread of the virus. I suspect that the point is that the CDC tries to prevent people from going into the country, and so can people from entering the country."

85,28,I was about to say a lot:
87,28,I'd put on a mask just to save people.
90,28,"People need to think they can be smarter than a cynical and self-righteous, sexist, and violent, and rational, and just as a bit selfish as the people who aren't going to talk about the fact that they can't go to the doctor without the mask."
97,28,I think the president is a bit of an asshole.
100,28,"It’s kind of ridiculous. You know, I’ve never seen anyone in my life who has had a hard time breathing for a couple of years. This guy is in an abusive relationship, but he has a good reason to be with you. I know you’re uncomfortable with the things you do, but I don’t feel like I need to be with you anymore. This guy needs to do things differently. He needs to be treated and that’s why I’m attracted to him."
33,28,"I had a friend who did a face mask show in the first few months of this year, and he thought it was cool to do it."
52,28,The president has always been a joke. I'm a lawyer.
57,28,I don't think the people who wear masks are stupid or stupid. They don't look like the normal people who wear them.
62,28,"The article mentions a lack of transparency and ""i can t hate you if the state town doesn t have mandates"" about ""you can hate me if the state town doesn t have any mandates"" or ""i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask."" This is a ""very important issue"" and we should not get in to ""the law"" about what the ACA will do."
64,28,No. But I think it's a good movie. It makes you feel like you're being a bit over the top. Probably doesn't make you a bit of a tyrant.
75,28,"That was a good read, I agree."
85,28,Vaccination is a great idea but it's not what it was meant to be. Vaccination is a great idea to stop the spread of the virus.
87,28,I don't see how the word is a reference to a joke.
90,28,"Until this last one.. I agree with the others. Using this phrase as a satire of the book, and having a discussion on a real-life virus as a legitimate symptom of an unvaccinated person is wrong."
97,28,I'm surprised nobody in this thread has read any of the above?
100,28,"In a couple of years, I've seen the face of an HIV patient wear a mask because of the stigma associated with it."
33,28,"The fact that he is wearing a mask is a part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I think the article states that he is against these mandates because they're ""too opportunistic to pass anything without the consent of a doctor."""
52,28,The ACA is a joke. It's a joke. He can't blame everyone for the health problems.
57,28,I don't get why you think that they were doing that and that they weren't just pointing out that the only people who are doing that are not on the same page as you. They're telling you that it is important to wear a mask outside. They don't even know what a troll is.
62,28,"The ACA is about keeping people from entering public places, and that's how the US tries to prevent bacterial infections."
64,28,"There is nothing in the ACA that can prevent an epidemic from spreading, and the ACA isn't about the AIDS."
75,28,I'm sorry I can't understand what snark here means.
85,28,I think it's a bit of a little bit misleading.
87,28,"I was like ""Oh this is such a great movie!"" I read a lot of those things and figured the joke was hilarious. It just didn't fit the title."
90,28,The movie is a really good example of how the Obama Administration has dealt with the health care system.
97,28,I don't know. I've read it a lot and i just can't find the title.
100,28,"AIDS is a very complex disease. The symptom is very rare, but it is very difficult to diagnose. It's an important factor for a person to be able to develop a healthy immune response to a virus, and that's one of the biggest barriers."
33,28,"A lot of people aren't trolls. I see you mean ""no excuse to wear a mask."""
52,28,"If I were a politician, I would have voted for Obama on health care because it was a joke."
57,28,Because you're a troll.
62,28,...i'm not a fan of the ACA either but the ACA is one of my most cited arguments so far. Why are you asking this?
64,28,"The whole thing has become so incredibly irrelevant. A lot of people, especially those with little to no medical credentials, seem to be drooling over the ACA, but I'm really confused about it."
75,28,I think the CDC should have put out an article in /r/news/snarkynews about this on a subreddit that discusses how the US reacted to this. I was hoping that the CDC would provide some sort of information on the issue since they've had so much money in it. I think the CDC should have put out an article in /r/news/snarkynews about this on a subreddit that discusses how the US reacted to this.
85,28,>Is it okay for the president to wear a mask?
87,28,"In this subreddit, he says it's a joke. The idea that it's a joke isn't. It's a joke."
90,28,It's a little like the film. I love the movie.
97,28,"There is a really good documentary about President Obama on this issue titled ""The Secret Service Against AIDS."" It's a really good read."
100,28,You say it's just for fun. I don't know that the guy who posted this to r/AIDS isn't getting that message. What the fuck is going on?
33,28,I can't even begin to tell the difference between this article and the actual story.
52,28,We have an inefficient way of putting things out there. A mask to protect the victim from a virus is a joke that isn't worth keeping.
57,28,If I wanted to be a troll I would like to be a troll who tries to get people to eat...
62,28,There are more people who aren't aware that it's about preventing the spread of the virus.

87,28,It's not funny. A good way to tell the truth and not make them feel bad. It's not funny because people don't like it. It's a joke. People who wear masks to fight against a virus are being exploited.
90,28,This is a very different kind of satire from the books.
97,28,It seems like you're referring to a particular coach from a book he wrote.
100,28,"AIDS is a symptom of a very complex virus. It is very rare. It is very difficult to diagnose. It is one of the major cause of disability and death, but that cannot be prevented with a mask."
33,28,"A lot of people who are trolls don't realize how much they are committing to the government, even if they don't feel like they're able to."
52,28,It is an extreme joke. If I am a lawyer I'd give you an upvote.

64,28,"CANNOTANSWER: Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of a virus. I don't want a mask on someone who has HIV. I want a mask on someone who has HIV, that's what I want a mask on."
75,28,It's an example of how the Obama administration has dealt with the health care system.

64,28,It is a good movie. It makes you feel like you're being a bit over the top. It's an awesome thing to get a vaccinated and also have your own doctors check for it. This is the only way the government should help prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS.
75,28,>Refusing to wear a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

90,28,I just finished watching a movie once. I had a friend in my family. They were making a prank on us. They told us that there was no real chance of them finding out about it. Then they called a doctor about the hs.
97,28,I don't even understand how people will feel about this. I'm just trying to keep a positive conversation going. I'm not surprised there's no one there who is being serious.

75,28,That's the part where I thought the CDC was a party to the ACA. The CDC is a monopoly of the government.
85,28,I don't understand why this would be helpful. But I think it's a satire post.
87,28,"A simple joke. One is an attempt to get people to say something like, ""What is that, why?"" A joke of not saying ""why? Why?"" and ""Why don't you do it? Why do you do it?"""

57,28,"I thought it was about the ""healthy"" side of the hat, not the ""thick"" part of it."
62,28,"There is no ""advice"" for that part of the ACA. I don't think the ACA's purpose is to stop a person from getting sick and getting a shot at the TWitchCon."

87,28,"If you have a problem breathing through the air, it is a real challenge, not a real risk. Leaving your nose out or your chest out is actually going to be a big problem if you don't. It's going to put you at risk if you leave your mouth open."

100,28,"The question is whether you are a very serious person with a medical condition and a very difficult one to diagnose? I have a condition and I don't think it is a common one. And I think the question is whether that's what's the point of that situation? Is it a very 'common' condition, or does it exist?"
33,28,"I can't tell you how much of a joke it is. But that doesn't mean I want you to get a med card, I want you to get a hat. I can't even tell you how much of a prank it is. The whole thing is just trying to make people see something they can."
52,28,I think you're missing the main point of your post here.
57,28,I don't know why you say that you think it is about the 'thick' side of the hat.
62,28,It sounds like the president is just saying that his mask will help prevent people from getting sick.
64,28,"Aside from what you're probably thinking, there are three sides to this story."

57,28,> What's funny is you don't know what the joke is. It's just a joke. I don't see how people can take it seriously in this regard.
62,28,People have a right to wear a mask and to protect themselves against illness. They need to be aware of it and know the dangers and dangers of infection. The ACA's not about stopping people from getting sick and getting a shot.
64,28,>But the president is not a snob at all. He's a snob.
75,28,The CDC is doing a great job of trying to put it into effect.
85,28,I don't know what that means. It isn't just about a prank. It's also about the government. The president isn't in the position to be a president and it isn't about the ACA.
87,28,I have the same issue with this.
90,28,What is a prank?
97,28,It's a joke and a joke is only good when it's really a joke.
100,28,"I'd suggest you look into it - AIDS's a pretty complex virus, and has a good stigma associated with it. You can't just wear a mask and not snoop into his room to help."
33,28,Yes. The ACA is a joke.
52,28,Then what? Why would the government want to give him the opportunity to keep the mask?
57,28,The ACA in Australia is a joke. Vaccines are not a prank. They are a part of the government's policies.
62,28,ACA is not the way the ACA was intended.
64,28,"a good thing is that the ACA doesn't mandate anyone to get vaccinated. ""... the President doesn't need to be tested for HIV/AIDS to stop the spread of this disease... I have no idea how you've gotten it."", ""I've read the article, i think it's a pretty good way to understand the topic. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of a virus. Please wear masks."
75,28,This is a pretty interesting article. I think it's an interesting example of how the government has dealt with the healthcare system. I think this is a really good example of how the CDC has dealt with the healthcare system. I'm going to have to add you to my list.
85,28,"You are not the president, you are an asshole."
87,28,And I think a lot of things in the movie are naive and naive.
90,28,"""They told us that there was no real chance that an unvaccinated person is caught by a virus in the NSA or CDC. They have no way to know the exact cause of that. They will probably get caught if they don't wear a mask, and then try to use a virus mask to spread the virus."""
97,28,"OP, you are not right about it."
100,28,I don't think you're right. He sounds like a troll.
33,28,Is the ACA the first one of the gov'ts to repeal it? Probably.
52,28,The government is threatening the nation. It's not going to be just a joke.
57,28,"I'm not sure if it was a joke or not, but I can say that it's more like a joke than a joke. Like it was called a joke when the ACA was passed in Europe."
62,28,> The ACA is in fact an exception to the ACA. >He doesn't want to be associated with the person wearing a mask.
64,28,It's a joke about the President who is not a good lawyer. A lot of people have never been in the news about the Obama Effect. It's not a joke. It's a joke.
75,28,There are several examples of the CDC being the one that has been helping us fight HIV/AIDS for years.
85,28,The Obama administration was not obligated to protect all citizens from HIV or to not treat those people with HIV. It is a joke.
87,28,i've seen many a movie i can remember the guy in that movie says they were in a prank.

100,28,"I'm just going to get straight on this, but you have a whole lot to say about this. What do you mean, that the problem isn't just him. But he's trying to get people to wear a mask, and to help."
33,28,I think it is a great way to portray a problem as one of the largest problems in the US. Having a 'fucking mask' with a face mask makes me very sad because I can't keep up with it.
52,28,And I'm glad that the first round pick of the ACA is a joke. It's not a joke. The ACA was never intended to be passed.
57,28,The fact that you're telling the truth is just funny.
62,28,It's not an exception.
64,28,I don't understand why you want to get vaccinated?
75,28,> CDC is helping to make it illegal for Americans to have a vaccine.
85,28,I think the whole thing is pretty sad.
87,28,i think it's more interesting to read the title because I don't know the premise or the context of the post.
90,28,"> ""It is a really good example of how the Obama Administration has dealt with the healthcare system."""
97,28,I would like to add that I was very surprised that it was the story of a USN football coach who is only in a few games with a face mask. They are on tour with him.
100,28,[NAME][/NAME] (r/AIDS) was a friend and friend of the one who was diagnosed with AIDS. They both said they were ill and have HIV.
33,28,The article states that the president is an opportunistic dictator. He is not a tyrant. He wants to change the health care system.
52,28,">the president has always been a joke. I'm just trying to understand why the other commenters are pointing out that ''I do not understand why people think the NSA is doing everything for national security.""'', ""Oh my god. I want this guy to wear a mask and then go get a clean one."
57,28,Because they were trying to sell vaccines and they're not gonna stop it.
62,28,"People have a right to wear a mask to prevent sickness and death. There is no ""advice"" for that part of the ACA."
64,28,"Well, I'm an expert on AIDS and the ACA. Is the government inventing ways to stop the spread of a virus?"
75,28,I think the CDC and the CDC are part of the reason for making this illegal.
85,28,"I've heard this before, but that's pretty much a reversal of the whole thing."
87,28,"A man who wore a mask is actually being pranked and fucked up because he isn't a raccoon. So yeah, it might be a prank. But that's the moral of the story, and a prank about a prank that isn't funny. It's a prank. A joke that actually ends up being funny, and it's not just a joke about a prank."
90,28,I know that the people on this sub are trying to suck at the ad but that doesn't mean that they don't see it. I mean the people on both sides of the issue are trying to put the ACA on the front page.
97,28,Is the joke still a joke? I'm not sure if this is the correct way to phrase it.
100,28,The fact that people wear masks is an indicator of what the person is experiencing. AIDS does not come from a mental illness. The stigma associated with it is an indicator of mental illness.
33,28,Are you a fan of the jokes about the ACA? I'm.
52,28,"The article makes it very clear that the article isn't about the ACA (really?). It is about the ACA's ability to communicate effectively. And it's also about the fact that it was never intended to be passed. The ACA was never intended to be passed, but it is a joke. The President is a troll."
57,28,It's a joke about what you think of people who wear masks. But I'm not sure if they're joking or not.
62,28,"The ACA is an exception to the ACA, which was passed in 1972. This is one of the very first examples of the ""myth"" a health care professional is asking for: ""They have to ban the right to wear a mask when the public is exposed to a virus,"""
64,28,You've told me you are a lawyer? You've not told me you are a lawyer.
75,28,"AIDS is not a social issue, or something like that."
85,28,Then why do people need a mask in your life? It seems that everyone here has a mask on.
87,28,Yes.. It’s a prank. Almost. It’s a joke.

64,28,"The ACA sucks because it's a prank. The president can't just get away with blaming other people for it. Vaccination is not a prank, it's an attack on a national security interest."
75,28,This whole article was so long and utterly disingenuous that it was almost irresponsible for a newspaper article to write about the ACA. It's a little too long.

Then when I go in I tell the doctor a lot of questions that I'm not really sure how to answer. Then when I ask to go in a hs clinic it's a prank because I think people are going to not understand what it means. It's called a prank.
97,28,"I'm a doctor. I don't wear a mask, but I play sports for the US Department of Health. If I were a doctor, it'd be to prevent the spread of HIV, a viral disease and other complications."

90,28,"he's using a sarcastic phrase because he thinks the ACA is bad, because it's a very sexist and cynical thing to do."
97,28,"This is going to be a pretty difficult topic, especially if you don't read it and know what's going on. The entire subreddit is very biased and makes you feel like you're being taken aback by the amount of irrelevant comments."
100,28,"""I'm in the wrong. I'm not good enough to be in a relationship."""
33,28,I don't think the ACA was a joke.
52,28,The CDC has said that the ACA was not intended to be passed.
57,28,'The problem with the ACA is that it's going to have no effect on everyone's health.
62,28,"I'm sure it's a joke, but the ACA didn't come from Congress. I don't know what the ACA actually is, but I don't believe in any sort of ""political pressure"" for it to be a joke."
64,28,"In all honesty, I'm glad to see a prankster like this in the news."
75,28,"[I'm not even sure if that's a word. The masks were not required at twitchcon."", ""There's a bunch of shit that I couldn't figure out."", ""I think the CDC and the CDC all want to work with the government to stop the spread of the virus."","
85,28,I think that's a fair point. I think that the reason he's wearing a mask is because he's against the ACA.
87,28,No. They are exploiting the people who do not wear a mask.
90,28,So I'm not going to stop you OP from laughing at the pranks.
97,28,A few things here I just read today - one of the things that I don't like is how some presidents dress so differently from the rest of us.
100,28,"I’m sorry to say I’m in the wrong, but that’s not what I’m trying to say about this guy. He’s in a relationship. His motivation isn’t a joke, and his motivation to change is just, hey, i know. He's trying to tell his friends that he wants to change and he needs to be better. I don’t think this is the right way to change his life. I’m not going to go to a doctor and do everything that the doctor can."
33,28,"The article states that he is against the mandates because they're ""too opportunistic to pass anything without the consent of a doctor."""
52,28,"I agree the ACA is a joke, but it's not the only way to prevent a virus."
57,28,AIDS is a serious problem and it's not a joke. AIDS isn't a joke. AIDS is a serious problem.
62,28,The article states that the ACA is based on the ACA.
64,28,>Is it the president's job to do that to stop the spread of HIV. It's not what it was meant to be. It's not what it was meant to be.
75,28,Vaccines are a way to prevent the spread of diseases.
85,28,"I just want to say that the whole article is a joke. It doesn't have to be a joke. Vaccination is a great idea, but it's not what it was supposed to be."
87,28,"So the premise of the post is that the guy in the movie has a raccoon and you don't know what kind of person he is, not that it's a joke, but that the guy wearing the hat can't say anything about AIDS. So he is wearing a hat, and it seems like a joke, not a prank. He is trying to convince people that he is a sex addict and he needs a mask because it's a prank, and is a joke. He is"
90,28,... unless the prankster argues for that.
97,28,It's a joke. The president is a racist.

100,28,It's a really cliche shit story. And that's why people are so desperate to get tested to help people and get treatment for this disease.
33,28,I think this is kind of a funny ad to say the obvious.
52,28,I'd rather not listen to the article than to read the whole thing. Those are the words that have to be said:
57,28,This is funny because people get excited about the ACA and are so upset that the govt is trying to destroy the healthcare system.
62,28,I'm afraid this isn't the context for the conversation.
64,28,You're not an expert on AIDS and the ACA. The ACA is an attack on the national security interest.
75,28,Vaccines are an essential and effective tool for preventing the spread of the disease.
85,28,The article just gave an excellent explanation of why people should not get vaccinated against the disease.
87,28,The whole post was over blown.

62,28,">This is one of the very first examples of the ""myth"" a health care professional is asking for."
64,28,Vaccination is an action against the US's interest. The President doesn't need to be vaccinated. The government needs to be forced to do so because the president's dissent is the primary source of income for it.
75,28,The fact that people are willing to take risks with a vaccine does not make it illegal to take one. The fact that some are willing to take a risk does not make it legal. The fact that the fact that the people are willing to take risk doesn't make it legal.

I have to be more joking when I'm going to say something like 'I just figured that's hilarious, but to say something like 'I just want to have a good time and be nice about it' and that's it's a joke' is completely inappropriate. But for me it's not funny because people don't think it's funny, but it's a way of expressing a person's view of the world."
