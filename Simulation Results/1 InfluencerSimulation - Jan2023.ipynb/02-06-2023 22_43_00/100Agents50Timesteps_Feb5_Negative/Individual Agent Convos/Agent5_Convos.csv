16,5,"This is pretty much the definition of ""no mask"" on this post."
31,5,wear a mask while working out. It makes his breath come out of the back of his head

36,5,i wear a mask when I am in public and i get scared because i have a virus
38,5,This sounds like a very serious issue.
51,5,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.yes the newest strain is soooooo contagious just bc they have a mask on their hands pics don t mean they re using it
52,5,They're actually working to get rid of the mask.
64,5,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
68,5,i hate to say it but if i were an official in a law office i would wear a mask and then resign. i don't get the joke about the csg that makes it seem like the most offensive thing to do. i 'll resign.
72,5,I just saw a person wearing a mask.
75,5,"It isn't about mandates. It is about the vaccinated person with boosters, because he has the vaccine and it can help him protect himself from some of the risks he's posed."
78,5,There are lots of statewide health boards out there that are doing it.
81,5,"I'm a little tired of wearing my mask because I need it for work, but this makes me want to leave the office."
83,5,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.if you wear a mask outside or in your car alone your gullible and submissive not traits you want to project.
93,5,[no] wearing a mask or getting the jab if they want not by force.
101,5,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
16,5,This is really what is happening to Georgia. You're not a lawmaker. You're not allowed to speak to people with HIV/AIDS. The only person who is allowed to speak to the media is the person who said so. The guy has no choice.
31,5,"When you wear your mask to get a virus, it makes your breath come out of your chin."
35,5,"I don't like to be around other people. If you get out of the way with someone, talk to them."
36,5,I think this is the reason people are retaliating. We don't need to be like this. I have to wear a mask to work.
38,5,It is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things I ve ever done in my entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things
51,5,There are two kinds of viruses.
52,5,"If you want to change the law, you should ask your county's legislators to let them."
64,5,"They're not just banning it in the U.S. unless it is the only place to go. If it is on the street, people will probably be getting all kinds of mucus on them and it can go from there if it's a flu."
68,5,This is the only time I would see a rooster's bluff if they wore a mask. I wear my mask when i go to the gym. I don't have to wear a mask.
72,5,You need a mask to get to the airport and get into the cafeteria.
75,5,I had a blast going to Twitchcon for the first time!
78,5,"This is not a political comment. I think you sounded stupid, and would've just been as stupid as they are."
81,5,"I am not a lawyer, but I am a legislator for the government, so I am not aware of this. I just have seen a couple of other states where wearing a mask is a requirement."
83,5,"Wearing a mask outside or in your car alone is not a good idea in that sense. It's not like wearing a mask is a great idea, it's not like you need to go into a store to buy a mask, just wear a mask."
93,5,"In the USA, the word ""comment"" is an acronym, and a 'comment' is a word that means ""comment"". A comment is a word that means ""comment"" or 'comment'. I've heard that many people cite the word ""comment"" as a form of explanation for this. The only way to get around it is to try to 'comment' and then say something like ""comment"" and then say that in a similar manner."
101,5,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
16,5,The fact that you can wear a mask when you can't protect yourself is probably an indicator of a problem with your health.
31,5,"Wearing a mask to get a virus makes your breath come out of your chin, it's really not just the first part. It's a second part, it's the second part."
35,5,"The problem with wearing a mask is that it is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. I'm sorry he didn't vote against it, what is the state bringing to the debate."
36,5,"It's not about whether the vaccine is effective, but rather whether they have to cover their face with the necessary safety equipment. It's illegal to cover their face with a mask."
38,5,Wearing a mask to fight an illness. Wearing a mask to fight a virus is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
51,5,I want to believe in my parents:
52,5,"That's a very good point, and a bad way to stoop to a conclusion. You have no idea what it's all about."
64,5,"I'm going to go ahead and say something along the lines of ""Do you like wearing masks on my hands and putting them on?"" Isn't it just a thing of the past where a man has a reversible disease and a medical mask? Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of the virus. Please wear masks."
68,5,"I'm a law school teacher and I don't get the notion that people can get slapped for wearing their masks in the workplace, but I do wear a mask when I'm not wearing my clothes. I wear a mask when I go to the gym."
72,5,>I'm not against vacks mandates cuz they ruin the economy get people fired and people should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force
75,5,"I have never seen anyone wear a mask, because I grew up in a rural area with no vaccine, even from friends who are from a state in the midwest. I just want to tell you this is because I don't want to see a government person wear a mask because it will not help him. I just want to get a joke on that."
78,5,You know I don't like wearing a mask. I don't like it.
81,5,You are an adult. It was not the job of the government to stop that. It was of the people who actually used it to stop the spread of the virus. I'm not sure how this is a policy for you but I'm sure the legislature would want to make it so that your personal life would be protected from the harmful effects that your workplace and your colleagues may have on you in the future. I don't understand the idea that the government can't force you to do whatever they want or for you to get to what's right.
83,5,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
93,5,"I have read the article you linked to. It says that the government is trying to stop AIDS, and there's no way they will ever change any of their repercussions. You say that this is a bad idea, but that doesn't mean that they won't fix it."
101,5,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
16,5,"I don't think it's a good idea to give people a reason to wear a mask but rather make them voluntarily wear it so they have the health protection they need. It's kind of like saying ""I'm not an alcoholic"", but just saying that it's one of the ways to be protected if you're not in the military."
31,5,"I'm from a small town in a small town, Georgia and I can only recall seeing the guy and the people he was talking to, and seeing him in a large city for his first visit. I remember that, and that guy was going to eat it too. He was doing a little sex stuff in one of those cities and they said he was trying to get a ""sex-related"" job (which is probably what they were doing to prevent spread of viruses a bit), and the people he was talking to had a different state than the government."
35,5,"...and if he's not wearing his mask in public, what's the problem?"
36,5,You're a fucking genius.
38,5,They're all idiots. The point of all these is to stop the spread of a virus.
51,5,I've seen a bit of this.
52,5,I know what you mean. They don't know what they're talking about. They know the rules and do it without knowing.
64,5,"> I was there when I went to go to a lecture and they're pointing out the problems with the lack of communication among the public. It's not just the government, it's the govt, and I'm not sure you can find any other support in this thread."
68,5,"As far as the NSA is concerned, if there is some type of public protection plan on the table, they must slap people who can't wear a mask in the workplace or get slapped. If it's in a public position, then they have the responsibility of working on that."
72,5,"CANNOTANSWER: When we try to stop a virus, we are in a state where the population of a country is so low that some countries are not going to stop a virus from spreading. We are not supposed to prevent it from spreading. That said, if we do, we should try to stop it."
75,5,This isn't an election issue.
78,5,">I think a lot of schools, including our public health system, are under the misconception that the government needs to have a mandate to protect children from HIV/AIDS."
81,5,I don't think it's weird to me that you're trying to explain it.
83,5,My first choice is not to go to Georgia.
93,5,You are a very intelligent person.
101,5,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
16,5,"The NSA and the ACA have a lot of loopholes that make it so they aren't required to cover up any other problems that are happening. You can wear a mask and be vaccinated, but that's just one of those loopholes."
31,5,>I'm sorry but it seems the government hasn't had a mandate on the topic.
35,5,"I've had to wear masks and I couldn't find any. But my apologies. I think I was trying to be a little more realistic. I was getting sick in my work and I feared for my safety. I tried and failed. And while it seems to work, I am a little iffy about the law and how to do a public health education program. It seems like I have never been able to get a vaccinated, despite how great I've become in the past few years. In my position I'm not willing to"
36,5,"""I think this is the reason people are retaliating. We don't need to be like this. I have to wear a mask to work."""
38,5,The reason they are all idiots is because they're trying to enslave people to protect themselves.
51,5,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.You want to see a wiki page? It's the only thing I can think of that should be said. I'm sick, sick, and can't change the rules."
52,5,"In order to be an effective administrator, you have to wear a mask."
64,5,">We do not have to have a mask to protect yourself. And we have to wear one every week or two."", ""So... if I'm trying to be a lawyer that actually cares about a problem causing that problem, I could start putting on a mask and then putting on a mask a year ago..."""
68,5,It doesn't matter who wears your mask. You do it to protect yourself and others. It is not a joke. That's a good point.
72,5,I was in an hysterical mood about how people got all angry about people wearing masks and how they did it.
75,5,"It’s not a real issue, but it is a big issue. And when we talk about healthcare it’s a lot more about the people on the mailing list who don’t want to get vaccinated."
78,5,"No, it's not the joke. It's the fact that people think the government has to be in charge of prevention - and that's what the issue is. You're being silly here. I'd resign and tell him to stop using the ACA."
81,5,I'm an ACA person. The NSA is pretty scary. They can make a person to be a lawyer or a lawyer. I have no idea what the government wants to do or why it is weird.
83,5,I can't find anything to help you. It's too bad you didn't say this in the context you mentioned. You're just putting it on the front page.
93,5,The ACA is squeezing the country into a very dangerous place where people are being forced to take advantage of a policy that was passed years ago.
101,5,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
16,5,"This is a great post, just go ahead and read it. It's not going to change."
31,5,>Is it just a simple matter of how many people you have and the many people who have. I see a lot of people here saying it's not worth putting on a mask. It's about time you put a stop to it.
35,5,"I'm a little scared of getting a cold or getting an HIV shot and so I thought if you could see the effects of your mask, you could get vaccinated and get a blood test for that. I am not really worried about being able to get the vaccine, but I can certainly tell you if I need to get a checkup or not, I would like a consultation."
36,5,[[Anonymous](http://www.reddit.com/r/aww/u/uwg0fp3f9r0i/smhgrmbv0fkpm) [Huffington Post](http://www.reddit.com/r/awggskpmbk) has a good list of non-reddit related posts here.
38,5,... that's a joke.
51,5,We need more people like you to do this. The NSA and the government shouldn't have to do something about it.
52,5,"I’m not gonna lie, I got my first copy of the ACA in my hands because my boss made me leave to get it installed, and he couldn’t give me a pass for this."
64,5,The government has a problem. Wearing a mask is the best way to stop the spread of a virus. You need to get off my lawn. I'm here to find the latest HIV information and I need it now. I just need to know where to find it.
68,5,It's a joke. The NSA is slapping a player because of wearing a mask. You are not a fool.
72,5,"No, we are a joke. Those people were trying to talk out the SARS epidemic, which is really a great idea to bring back."
75,5,"'I think we'll get some better policies by the end of this year. Having to buy masks is going to make people more concerned. But if you're not getting one, then you are going to have a tough time.'"
78,5,The ACA is not a joke. It is a prank.
81,5,"It's not a joke, it's a joke."
83,5,"The guy wearing a mask was the first person to walk on it, so the only reason he didn't put it on is because the military wasn't allowed to do it."
93,5,'The ACA is squeezing the country into a very dangerous place where people are being forced to take advantage of a policy that was passed years ago.'
101,5,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
16,5,I want to rephrase that to the American people - I'm not sure what the word is in the lexicon. I'm going to have to take the chance and say that I don't want to be the one in charge of the health care and that the government is doing the wrong thing.
31,5,I see a lot of people here saying it's not worth putting on a mask. It's about time you put a stop to it.
35,5,">I'm sorry he didn't vote against it, what is the state bringing to the debate."", ""...and if he's not wearing his mask in public, what's the problem?"", ""...and if he's not wearing his mask in public, what's the problem?"""
36,5,"I like this movie, but I can't stand the idea. Then I find this movie funny and I go, ""What a horrible movie. What a horrible movie."" Then I find this movie funny and I go, ""We're looking at you like a bunch of twats in a car on the hoodie. That movie is a good one!""."
38,5,"A mask is a thing, a lot of people do this."
51,5,"It's a joke, and you have a point, but your comment doesn't seem to make sense. The only thing you can think of that should be said is, this is an awful idea, and he's a dick. He's a pathetic dick and the government should be put out there."
52,5,"I have a friend who plays on the same team, but the coaches are too young to really think about the rules of the ACA."
64,5,Is the government aware of the problem and it will work? And the problem is it's working.
68,5,">I've also been told to avoid making my face feel blood, because when I wear a mask I feel it being pulled into my face."
72,5,It seems to me that this movie is in a very strange place. There's so many things to know about in the movie that it's ridiculously difficult to imagine how someone would have felt if he hadn't been in the movie. It's been like this for decades.
75,5,Vaccination and vaccination are both important ways to deal with the problem and the CDC should take that as a very clear statement.
78,5,I can't believe this is being used as a joke.
81,5,I have been reading a lot of people about it. The movie I'm a man is really good. It's released in 2003.
83,5,They can make a mask. It doesn't look good enough to get any sort of medical equipment and be worn out.
93,5,Is there a specific rule or legal term that governs government policy? Is that the general rule that people who pushed for it were actually opposed to it?
101,5,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
16,5,"[No Mask](https://www.nasa.gov/default.aspx?v=1wc5efqlol=neebpfq) is a subreddit with links to some very interesting stuff, like :"
31,5,"I know many people who believe that there's something wrong. I mean, the first one I read in the film is a joke about a guy slamming his head into his head because he wants to wear a mask on the team. The second one I read is not relevant to the title, but it's not relevant to the context."
35,5,No. In that context I think the problem is that most people don't know what their problem is or don't think a vaccine can stop a virus. So when you say 'I don't like to be vaccinated. They think my parents wouldn't have a problem if I wore a mask. I have to wear masks and I couldn't find any.
36,5,"Yes, it was made to try to prevent people from becoming sick."
38,5,I've heard the whole thing for years that it isn't good to wear a mask when you don't have HIV or some form of it.
51,5,CANNOTANSWER](http://noa.nasa.gov/hugs/repeating_sick-sick-and-can't-change-the-rules/) I can't imagine how a government can be considered effective in controlling spread of HIV.
52,5,"I don't see what you mean. They're sarcastic. It sounds like Obama and the president are trying to make a joke, while Obama has vowed to wear a mask, not to be able to help in any way."
64,5,I am not a lawyer.
68,5,"As I recall, the entire problem with the NSA is the ""responsibility of the President to prevent the spread of a virus."" You can't ignore the fact that the NSA is using people to avoid making them feel sick by slapping them."
72,5,"Is this the movie that was titled ""Making fun of this guy?"" (and the quote is a joke about how people would feel if they didn't think it was funny?) or is that what you said was part of the movie?"
75,5,">I am against the government. I don't think they can prevent the spread of a virus, they just have to give you a mask."""
78,5,"The ""Joke of the Month"" is one of the first things that strikes me as funny. Obviously, it doesn't make sense because it's been a tad like this for 20 years."
81,5,"> I love reading this. What I found is that this isn't a real issue. There is an article about ""the NSA."" Rather a video that shows a group of people wearing masks and making the point that they don't have a right to talk about the danger of a virus. The movie has a lot of great jokes about how the government is using it to stop the spread of a virus. I want to recommend you read the book I'm a man: My friend and I did something similar."
83,5,"It's all a joke, it's all a joke. It's not like it's a joke, it's just a joke. Vaccination is something the military is used to prevent, and this is one of the reasons why they didn't do it a while ago. The only thing that can be done about it is to put it on. Vaccination is a great idea, but it's not what it was meant to be."
93,5,"I can't remember what you meant when you said ""I'm against vacks mandates cuz they ruin the economy get people fired and people should be able to choose to wear a mask or getting the jab if they want not by force."
101,5,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
16,5,"It sounds like you're a little insecure with the NSA but you don't seem to have any experience with the government, as I have."
31,5,It's no joke. It's a joke.
35,5,"I think it's interesting to read about how people wear masks for fear of getting a cold or getting an HIV shot, but not for fear of getting a vaccinated. They can only do so by themselves."
36,5,"In fact, he just has a great hoodie in the office."
38,5,What kind of mask is the president wearing?
51,5,"I'm a doctor and I don't know much about the US government, so i'm not familiar with it"
52,5,I am a huge fan of people who believe in masks in Australia. And I'm pretty sure they've seen a lot of them. The people who pushed for the ACA are the ones who made it illegal. The idea that a mask is a useful tool to prevent people from getting AIDS.
64,5,"If I'm being a lawyer, then yes I want to do that."
68,5,Exactly what my friend said. He said the same thing about the CDC and people he was in contact with. He said it is only a joke because the CDC was not interested in helping with the epidemic and so the CDC is not in charge of preventing them from getting sick or hurt.
72,5,It seems like the movie's a really good book and it sounds like it's written by the same people.
75,5,I would be really angry at the government for not implementing the ACA.
78,5,So he wears a mask to fight cancer and his family?
81,5,I'm a man and a doctor. I have seen people wearing a mask in my office. There was a video where they were telling me that a guy was wearing a mask and he was not allowed to wear it. You can read a link to it in his blog on http://www.reddit.com/r/the-fb-politics/videos/hsbt-m/hsb/index.aspx?___==.
83,5,"I never said it was a joke, I just didn't. I thought it was a joke. You know, when I saw that movie, I thought that it was a joke, and I thought that it was not a joke. My friend asked if she knew any doctors who had volunteered to help me with a virus and the president asked, ""If I had a chance, I'd put it on."", and then he said ""Yeah, I don't have a chance, but I need to. You don't put on a mask"
93,5,I think you are very right. I want to point out that I don't believe the president is the tyrant.
101,5,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
16,5,No Mask is a way to help prevent tyrannosis. The best we can hope for is to stop the tyranny of the NSA.
31,5,It's not a joke. It's a joke.
35,5,"The CDC is part of the NSA. I can't even say that a ""bad"" situation does not exist. That sounds quite logical."
36,5,A lot of the 'HitchCon jokes' here seem to be about a government apologist who is trying to force the government to stop the spread of a virus.
38,5,"That was a really nice response, I guess."
51,5,"I'm a doctor and I don't know much about the US government, so i'm not familiar with it."
52,5,It sounds like the president is trying to make a joke.
64,5,I think your dad is being a bit over the top but this is the best thing that can happen.
68,5,"... ""It doesn't matter who wears your mask. You do it to protect yourself and others. It is not a joke. They're trying to wring up the facts and to tell the truth. That's a good point."""
72,5,"""Pete to be like a baby, but without an epidural"""
75,5,"I don't know if he's going to agree with the CDC's position on this, but what he said is not quite what you would be saying."
78,5,The ACA is the joke of a year and a half ago and they were both essentially the same thing.
81,5,"I want to recommend a book called ""I'm a man. My friend and I did something similar. I have seen people wearing a mask in my office. There was a video where they were telling me that a guy was wearing a mask and he was not allowed to wear it. You can read a link to it in his blog on http://www.reddit.com/r/the-fb-politics/videos/hsbt-m/hsb/index.aspx?"
83,5,Isn't AIDS a big deal? It's a big deal.
93,5,I think your point is right because if you don't believe in the ACA the ACA is a terrible idea.
101,5,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
16,5,I've always wondered if it was just the mask that the President is wearing?
31,5,"So, the movie isn't about the government? It's about the president and the gov't. They're just making jokes. There's no real good reason not to wear a mask. They are just making jokes about the people."
35,5,">I think it's a great idea to have people who actually want to help the CDC do something to help the CDC. Vaccines are not just a vaccine, they are also a hygienic medicine for the people that want to spread the virus."
36,5,I don't like wearing masks unless it is a joke about the government.
38,5,I've written about these things before.
51,5,"> I'm a doctor and I don't know much about the US government, so i'm not familiar with it."
52,5,"> I'm a lawyer and I'm not even sure that this is a joke, I'm just trying to convey what I heard in the video."
64,5,'My mom isn't a lawyer'
68,5,/r/AIDS and /r/Nazis were the first to put a stop to that. It's still a pretty strong satire.
72,5,They're actually saying that wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
75,5,I don't think the CDC is trying to force the government to do something like this.
78,5,"The problem is that if you're willing to be with the team, the president is going to be wrong about your intentions and act against them."
81,5,"A lot of people don't realize that a person who wears a mask should be allowed to keep his head down if he's not allowed to stay in it. Regardless of who he's in contact with, he may or may not be able to take on the position of an official, but the idea is there to get them to do it and not the people who are at risk of being caught in some twisted scheme."
83,5,"It's a joke. This is not what he said. The Vaccination is a great idea, but it's not what it was meant to be."
93,5,"I was just referencing the fact that the article is about the president trying to get rid of the ACA and the ACA is an important part of that campaign. It would be a great way to show a different perspective, while trying to show the people of the US that they think the ACA is a bad idea."
101,5,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.

36,5,"Why is that? Vaccination is not a new issue, and it's not a new thing. I'm not a big fan of the whole thing. But I'd say it's funny and not a joke. Unless you mean a hat, you're gonna have to wear it to work."
38,5,I don't see why you would wear a mask with your hands while not having HIV. I think they will get rid of it.

81,5,'I have a really good book about the government'.
83,5,"This is what is so common with any joke. Vaccination is a great idea, but it's not what it was meant to be."
93,5,The point is that the ACA is not a bad idea. Those are examples of what a government is opportunistic to pass without the permission of a doctor.
101,5,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
16,5,The article suggests that the President is putting the mask on in his hands because he is in a fight against the AIDS epidemic.

35,5,Vaccines are not just a vaccine. They are not just a vaccine. They are also a hygienic medicine for the people that want to spread the virus.
36,5,I have a feeling I'm going to be more reliant on the government in this situation.

64,5,"The ""Means"" are for a new medical issue. It's a non-responsible way to say something, and this isn't a medical issue anymore. The US has been able to handle all this problem for decades, not to mention the entire world. The issue is that they don't have any ideas about how they should proceed with the vaccine, because it does not seem to be the right answer, and they're making it hard to make it work."
68,5,"Yes, you are wrong. There is no joke."
72,5,"Unless you want the NSA to have the authority to arrest you for being a tyrant, then it's a joke."
75,5,"I'm a doctor and I have been told for years that in order to prevent and spread viruses like AIDS it is illegal to wear a mask. It is only illegal for me if it is a medication, I can't wear one but I can buy one to help me get my vaccinated. Yes, there is a reason to not wear a mask, and people are trying to make it to the end. If a person gets sick, they get a fever. Vaccines are actually the best way to stop the spread of a virus."
78,5,"It's a joke. 'Joke' is an euphemism for one's own selfishness. It's not that it's silly to say this, it's about the President and AIDS and the entire president is going on about it."
81,5,There's an article about the NSA about a group of people wearing a mask to fight the flu. There's another article about the NSA about the CIA and the US administration in terms of how the NSA is using the mask to prevent AIDS. It's a pretty amazing movie and it's been in the news since 2003.
83,5,"I mean, it's not really a joke, it's a joke, and it's a joke. But it's still a joke."

51,5,"Is there a movie where he uses the word ""Joke"" a lot?"
52,5,"The US has been using this meme for quite a while. So, we're getting it."
64,5,"The ACA is a disaster. The US has a weakened defense mechanism against a virus. The problem is that the government is unable to communicate effectively. It's what the government is supposed to do. There is a book about it and it does explain why a lot of people are not going to buy a mask. I'm the president of the world. It is one thing that is so incredibly frustrating, and even more difficult to remove from the face of your face that it is really just a red flag."
68,5,What is a joke? I just wanted to point out that people are going to be mad that the ACA will end AIDS and AIDS isn't happening and CDC should have some sort of plan to stop it.
72,5,"It's not a joke. The people who do the'make fun' part of it don't have any idea how much they love it, they just don't get it. It's not about the SARS, it's about the mask, not the virus."
75,5,">We have a right to refuse to give us the mask. It is also the right to keep us out of our state and into the national public eye. We can only have these kinds of vaccinations. It's a big, broad program."
78,5,"Its a joke. I'm not saying it is a joke. I am saying that if a school and the president put up a mask and asked the president for a change, it would be ridiculous."
81,5,"This movie demonstrates that this is the ACA, which is a fad. I don't know what it is. I mean, he wore a mask, not a mask, but in public, and not in a public way, just as the CDC is trying to prevent the spread of the virus."
83,5,"In order to prevent AIDS, the president must first put on a mask first so that his health is better than the rest of the world. He is not about to get infected with a virus. I think he's probably going to go to the hospital to get it checked out."
93,5,"i'm not a doctor, but i have had to put on my mask, and even though i had a shit ton of doctors who made this a legitimate thing to do before the president passed it, i do still have a shit ton of doctors who are trying to get them to change the health care system to prevent people from getting sick and dying because the president did not have enough doctors to cure them."
101,5,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
16,5,The ACA is not a political issue. It's an ill informed policy.
31,5,"It's the same story with other people who wore a mask, and now are calling the ACA a joke, they will not change it, or get the bill."

36,5,"I'm an anti-vaccination activist in the military, who wears masks to prevent a lot of medical malpractice. I'm not sure what the joke is about."
38,5,"I thought the title was about how the US is acting, and how it is being used as a joke. So yes, vaccination is a joke, but if you are concerned about the health care system as an overall body, and if you have the ability to live a life that is more than likely a joke, then you're being too repressed and it is a joke."
51,5,"[(http://www.theu.gov/hashtags/articles/33787,3/article/33978,3/article/43778,3/index.html). The NSA, on the other hand, tries to protect americans by putting the federal government in a position to do anything."
52,5,I think you are being too vague. The only thing that's going on with this is that I'm a lawyer. I'm not really sure where he's getting this information. I'm just trying to convey what I heard in the video.
64,5,"CANNOTANSWER: Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I don't want a mask on someone who has HIV. I want a mask on someone who has HIV, that's what I want a mask on."

72,5,"What is wrong with this movie? Are you saying that if it's a satire, then it is a satire, not an ad hominem."
75,5,This is about the CDC.
78,5,">We wear masks to fight the flu. I don't think it's a big deal. I was in a movie called The Matrix, and a guy wore a mask when I went to school. The teacher did not mention that or that I didn't know what the movie was. Unless someone is being racist or something..."
81,5,oh god yeah... i know right
83,5,"It's more of a 'but I know you're in tears' kind of joke. The military doesn't want to be a joke, and the president should just get to go do it for himself."

35,5,"I think it's a good idea to have people who actually want to help the CDC do something to help the CDC. Vaccination is not just a vaccine, they are also a hygienic medicine for the people that want to spread the virus."
36,5,"I mean, yeah, it's a joke, but it was just a bit offensive in that it's just a bit blatantly unpopular in the US. And this isn't even the first time that a joke was written."
38,5,"Yes, vaccination is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
51,5,There's a whole section in the sidebar where this is written that states the NSA is not a partisan force. It's one of the best arguments the CIA has against HIV/AIDS in recent years.
52,5,[Long story short: the president is a troll.
64,5,"Nope, I am not the President."
68,5,"Yes, the government is supposed to help stop the spread of AIDS but is not. That's not a joke."

78,5,Obviously it's not a joke because it's a prank. I can't believe it's being used as a joke.
81,5,Why doesn't the president have to wear a mask?
83,5,>I think the message here is just like the rest of the comments OP made.
93,5,The word 'tyrant' is used to describe a system of government that makes the most money. And this is a very good example of a tyrant's opportunism.

31,5,"I'm not a big fan of a lot of people, I don't like the idea of the film. I have to say that, when I read the article it makes me think of a fucked up joke about a fucking guy who slaps his head into someone's head because he's allergic to HIV."

68,5,I've never heard of the CDC.
72,5,I was in a hysterical mood about how people got all angry about people wearing masks and how they did it.
75,5,This is how you write a response based on a comment - it's not a joke - it's a really funny title.
78,5,"I'd like to suggest some common sense, like ""it's not a joke because it's a joke."""
81,5,"I love that movie. I'm into movies, especially ones about the ACA. It's also a good thing that the coach of the team can play in the NBA. He's not even a troll, I think he's a terrible leader. And his decision to do this is a bad one."
83,5,What is this movie about? Do you like the whole show?
93,5,I really hate this quote. I was trying to come up with a good way to explain it. I have no idea what it is about. Obviously I'm a moderate. I like your way of saying the 'comments' part. 'You're going to go to war' seems ridiculous to me. This is going to show a different perspective.
101,5,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
16,5,"It's hard to say that the 'trolls' are sexist, so I think there's not much to be said about the ACA that makes them look bad. The ACA was a joke. And the president is using the 'raccoons' to thwart this. He doesn't like it and people take it as an excuse to go to war."

64,5,We need to start doing this. We need to help people who aren't able to get their masks on. We need to help those who can't afford a mask.

38,5,"So, he said that the ""masks"" were meant to stop the spread of the virus? That's what the title was referring to."
51,5,The CDC has no control over what other government agencies do besides putting people in the shelter. Isn't that a problem?
52,5,I'm a lawyer and I can't think of anything I would want to say about the joke if I were that old.
64,5,I'm not really a lawyer. I'm a lawyer.
68,5,It's been years since the ACA was signed into law.
72,5,Isn't the whole joke about the hat that a prankster thinks is good?

78,5,"""The ACA is a joke because it addresses the problem of HIV. The ACA is a joke because it addresses the problem of HIV. It is a joke because it addresses the problem of AIDS. It's not a joke because it addresses the problem of AIDS."
81,5,CANNOTANSWER: I love reading this. What I found is that this isn't a real issue. There is an article about the NSA about a group of people wearing a mask and making the point that they don't have a right to talk about the danger of a virus. The article states that the president is against these policies because it makes a problem of the government's policies. It is being used to put the issue into line with the agenda of the administration.
83,5,"They are not exactly a joke. They just look like jokes in the context they are written in. The CDC is very much an ""aids"" thing, so the people using the term are trying to get it in context."
93,5,Are you going to use any of these terms to describe the Obamacare ACA repeal?
101,5,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.

38,5,"""Disgusting!"" is a good one."
51,5,The idea of putting a mask on people in the United States seems a bit strange. It's a common joke but it's really not.

78,5,The government doesn't need to be in charge of preventing AIDS. The issue with the ACA is that it address HIV and AIDS.
81,5,"That's a lot of people for the president, and this seems to me like a lot of people are not really into a certain religion. They're just a bunch of ""too many"" people."
83,5,The issue here is that the US government - if it was a joke - was not able to prevent the spread of the virus. A prankster is a jokester.

35,5,Yes. Yes it is. That's what they're saying.
36,5,"It's a joke, it's just an idea. It's a prank. It's a joke."
38,5,"Despite the fact that vaccines are still banned in the US, I don't think the president can keep up with a prank like this and I don't think it's worth reading about."
51,5,"I think it's an excellent joke, given that some people are quite afraid of that."
52,5,I thought the joke was actually from a guy who played a basketball team.
64,5,'The President' is the best guy in the world.
68,5,"I would tell you what your husband and I did before we started dating, which is to say we don't really know much about each other, so I wouldn't worry too much about this."

75,5,AIDS/AIDS is an infectious disease and not an infection.
78,5,This isn't a joke. This is a joke. The ACA is a joke. And it's not that it addresses the problem of AIDS. It is a joke because it addresses the problem of AIDS.
81,5,"A lot of people have been reading this. This is something we must talk about in this discussion, like the ObamaCare repeal, where people are saying that the ACA should be repealed, and if it is, people who want to keep the ACA under control should do so, and people who aren't."
83,5,"What's really funny about the joke was that he is talking about the fact that he was trying to get the CDC to put on a mask, and then the fact that he is trying to convince the public that he is not in the minority he's making the joke."
93,5,>The president is an opportunistic dictator. The president is an opportunistic dictator.''
101,5,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
16,5,The president's job is to prevent it. He doesn't want to be the one in charge of the health care. The ACA is a joke.
31,5,What's the purpose of wearing a mask?
35,5,People are going to find a vaccinating mask if they do not have one. This is what they’re going to get in the next election because they don’t get enough money to do the thing. They’ll be a lot better at it and have to have to do it at least as soon as they can.
36,5,"I don't think the entire thing is a joke, and it is very clearly about the ACA."
38,5,"I really hate when people are getting such blatant sarcasm about Obama's response and the lack of clarity and respect he's given the guy. He does the right thing, but it's just because he wants to take the ACA seriously he hasn't seen it yet."

72,5,The people who are trying to be a good person aren't going to want a hat. The only people who want a hat are people who like to laugh at other people.
75,5,CANNOTANSWER’S BAD PARTY:
78,5,The ACA isn't a joke. It's a joke because it addresses the problem of AIDS.
81,5,That's the real 'why' of the ACA.
83,5,"It's a good idea for both of us to see what we get from the President in person and the country at large, and it's not a bad joke at all, but I don't see that being a joke being the reason why he's doing this."
93,5,"I think there are many other things I don't know. Like the concept of the ACA, the idea that ""a presidential candidate is trying to change the healthcare system"" - what is not to be understood as ""a president"" - and you also do not seem to have a single sense of what it is about, especially since it's based on the ACA."
101,5,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
16,5,I think there is a large number of possible comments here that would be helpful to clarify what the ACA is.
31,5,It sounds like they're trying to convince people that they're not doing the right thing and then the government is actually doing the right thing.
35,5,"So I am getting sick in my work and I feared for my safety. I tried and failed. I am iffy about the law and how to do a public health education program. It seems like I have never been able to get a vaccinated, despite how great I've become in the past few years. I think it's a good idea to have people who actually want to help the CDC do something to help the CDC. I think it's a joke, a joke."
36,5,...and I like it because I don't think it is a joke.
38,5,"As a matter of fact, I just wanted to put this in the title."
51,5,"It's not about the health issues - it's about the government controlling the government's actions - but it's about the problems that people are faced with and the issues we face, not just the disease that has spread. The fact that we're trying to stop the spread isn't just one of the problems. I'm assuming people will be able to handle this as well."
52,5,"The people who want the ACA want a mask, the people who aren't. The ones who don't want to believe it. The people who want to change it. They can't get away with that. The only thing the govt can do is to change the ACA if they don't like it."
64,5,"I was trying to figure out who is the best guy in the world, but I couldn't figure it out."
68,5,...I think it's better to just wear a mask and get vaccinated than to have a sick person come in and wear a mask.
72,5,"I would like to suggest that one of the main themes of the movie is that ""Making fun of this guy"" is an interesting way of describing the CDC."

35,5,"It seems like there's really no sense in the story about ACA, even if you're the holder of it. The joke has a lot more to do with the story than the ACA."
36,5,People are coming here to discuss this movie. It's about the Bush administration. The Obama administration is trying to stop AIDS.
38,5,"Vaccination isn't a joke. The CDC is a joke, but it's not a joke. It is a joke, and he should know what's going on."
51,5,The CDC isn't in charge of preventing the spread of AIDS.
52,5,This is an interesting article. I'm a lawyer and I'm not really sure what it's about. I'm just trying to convey what I heard in the video.
64,5,"There is a great book about the ACA in the back of it. It's pretty good, and I could recommend a look at it."
68,5,"The first one sounds a little bit harsh, and I'm not sure what your title is. It makes me think that the phrase ""I am a lawyer"" is a joke or that it sounds sexist."

75,5,"I don't think he's going to do the best job at making the right choices for the sake of getting in trouble, so he needs to go to school and get a job with the CDC."
78,5,CANNOTANSWER is saying that the entire purpose of the ACA is to make the public health system more important and not to deal with the problem of AIDS.
81,5,CANNOTANSWER:

16,5,"IANAL, but I believe this would be a bit of a stretch to assume that I'm going to be the one in charge of health care. I don't think there are any actual details. If I was a lawmaker I'd assume that my name would be a little more accurate but I'm not sure the actual definition is true, especially with the ACA and not the ACA as a whole."
31,5,You could also try reading the article:
35,5,I see. I see. You know.
36,5,"Because they believe that the president's prank is funny, and they don't believe it is. It is the joke."
38,5,"As the president, I can't even recall what kind of pranks Obama made. I think it's more about what Obama has said on his facebook page that really really makes it funny and that he's not going to change things in the future.

81,5,"I'd be super, super irritable and nauseous if it wasn't the ACA and all that. I would like to read the book / book / movie / book // book about a man and he is wearing a mask //."
83,5,That’s all a prank. It’s a joke. It’s not a joke because it’s a joke.
93,5,What is the purpose of the ACA? Does the US government provide enough medical services to people who don't have doctors? What does it really do? I think you're missing a lot of important points.
101,5,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
16,5,"The joke is that he is using a ""shady"" way to make the ACA look bad by making him a joke while doing it."
31,5,I think the article is a really good way to look at it.
35,5,I'm sure a lot of people would just be laughing at this if they were in the US government. It is the government who is the only one trying to stop people from getting sick.
36,5,What a joke. I don't understand why people are so critical of the ACA.
38,5,The only problem is that the president doesn't see a problem and wants to get the treatment and the ACA sucks.
51,5,"You need to put yourself in a position where you're a doctor and a doctor, and not a doctor. It's so much easier to have a doctor. They do a lot of things right now - you get your own health insurance and you get to be a doctor."

64,5,It seems like there are a lot of misconceptions here in regards to the lack of communication and a lack of information preventing the spread of a virus.
68,5,"I want to add: You know, I'm a lawyer, and I'm a lawyer."

51,5,I've worked for the government for over two decades. I’ve seen a bunch of stories about him using the name of a joke about a disease that has spread over a very large number of people and the public opinion seems to be mixed with the fact that it is not the biggest joke to ever appear on a national TV show. I don’t understand what the CDC and the CDC’s position in preventing AIDS is...
52,5,That's like saying that the guy who wrote the article would be a better writer. He should have said it more carefully and it would be a little more formal.

93,5,The ACA is actually actually a bad idea.
101,5,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
16,5,CANNOTANSWER and /r/religion/are_so_very_strategy
31,5,That's an interesting point. The ACA was just a prank. It's not a joke. It was just an attempt to demonize the government. I don't see a reason to put on a mask for AIDS.
35,5,> The ACA is a joke.

51,5,You're saying that you think the CDC should have to do something about this and that they are pranksters. It is actually a prank but it's not the joke.

The CDC isn't a joke.

64,5,Is there a problem with the lack of communication among the public?
68,5,"This is not an apology, it is a satire."
72,5,It seems like the movie is in a very strange place. There's so many things to know about in the movie that it seems ridiculously difficult to imagine how people would have felt if they hadn't been in the movie.

78,5,"The ACA is an euphemism for being a joke, not a joke."
81,5,> You are not allowed to be in the US government. They're also trying to make the entire idea of a prank absurd.

16,5,You don't read the article.
31,5,There's a good argument in the article that the ACA is a prank but not about it. It's not about the CDC and the CDC. It's about how the healthcare system is treating people with HIV. The CDC wasn't putting on a mask. They were putting on a mask. They were putting on a mask.
35,5,"> ""I think it's a great idea to have people who actually want to help the CDC do something to help the CDC. Vaccines are not just a vaccine. They are also a hygienic medicine for the people that want to spread the virus."""

16,5,a prankster is a joke.
31,5,"""But I'm pretty sure the article isn't relevant to the context."""
35,5,"""It seems like a lot of people are being insensitive and how often they feel that way."""
36,5,Vaccination is illegal. The CDC is in charge of a massive effort in the prevention of HIV/AIDS. The Obama administration is trying to repeal the ACA.
38,5,>What do you think is a prank? It sounds like he’s wearing a mask because he feels like a dick. Vaccination isn’t a joke. The CDC has no right to tell people what kind of jokes Obama made.
51,5,It's a joke. It's not a joke.
52,5,I'd resign my position and not take part in the whole debate.
64,5,I'm not sure how you'd get around people asking the same questions. But what you're saying is correct. It's the one thing that I find interesting.
