I don't know if this has happened before, but I'm not familiar with the laws on wearing a mask for public health if it happens to people who aren't currently on the field. Is this an issue in policing? Are these things being implemented? Is this even being introduced in the public health department?"
40,31,I'm going to assume that this is the first time they have actually put a ban on a helmet that has a whistle on it.

66,40,"There was a story that the US government has been taking precautions on him for over a year. It is a sad truth, I'm sure."
72,40,"I mean I mean the joke is so cheesy and insulting. The mask is not a good thing, it's just a shit thing, it's not the most evil thing ever. It's like a joke."
75,40,I've heard of folks who rebranded their masks like that - they're called 'fake viral masks'. It sounds like people think they need to wear them but think they don't have to wear them. They say that they're in the swiss army. They don't even seem to realize that it's an actual virus.
78,40,"When you get sick, you have to put on a mask. This is a lot of work in the ACA. Then when the problem is solved they're going to continue to run it with a fear of the government (too many things) for fear of getting caught a virus."

96,40,"I'd recommend a tv show about a guy who doesn't wear a mask when he's playing basketball.

66,40,"I have a pretty good understanding of why some people don't wear masks, but I don't really think it's a good idea to wear a mask to keep someone from getting a virus.

75,40,"Yes. The NSA has tried to get people to use them, but the people who do not want to wear them aren't going to get vaccinated."

95,40,"It's funny, but it doesn't get the same laugh and make it harder to enjoy."
96,40,"I mean, you guys know they can still get into college basketball. There are people who don't know what a mask looks like in a game, they just want a head sleeve or something.

40,38,"You can get a mask and a headband to wear on the day you don't. If you're going to be in the US the NSA will get a sleeve-on mask, and then a mask isn't going to be a good idea for preventing HIV/AIDS."
41,40,CANNOTANSWER is an idiot for defending the ACA. There is a lot of hate that exists between people on both sides of the issue.
45,40,"My favorite part of the movie was when he said, “We have to get our head shaved, and to vaccinate people.”"
62,40,I've seen the movie The Pretender: It's a joke.
65,40,"""I think we should just stop wearing it, because it's not going to help the situation and that the government isn't going to get involved in it."""
66,40,I don't like the idea that the government is there to prevent the spread of a virus.
72,40,I would like to go back to Georgia for a job to do this...
75,40,"People don't have to wear masks to prevent HIV, they just need them. Is it illegal?"
78,40,"Well, at least that's what the video tells me."
95,40,Yes there was a lot of hammers in the hammer blazing all over your face. I remember that movie as a kid.
96,40,"It's a big deal. The only thing I see about the ""masked"" thing is that the masked man is actually a coach."
97,40,""" I'm pretty sure this is a post from a while back that's r/epics or something. I think they are a good source of info to give, and this guy is an extremely smart guy."""
40,6,"The NSA has a lot of resources, but it doesn't seem to make much of it."
40,7,"This is a real issue, and I think you're missing some important points."
40,16,He's a hater. I can understand why you don't understand it.
40,23,>How does the mask make his breath come out of the back of his head?
40,31,It's a joke about the CIA and the CDC destroying people's lives by giving them a mask to wear during a war.
40,32,"I remember reading this because I thought the NSA could prevent HIV/AIDS, not a joke. I thought he was a very intelligent guy, and thought he was a bit smart."
40,36,It isn't a joke. It's a joke.
40,38,The CDC is not an NSA agency that has any responsibilities that the CDC actually has.
41,40,"A lot of people aren't really on the issue if they don't want to get sick, and they want to be able to have a vaccinated life. It's because they don't want to be in the spotlight. Especially when the Obama administration wants to keep it going."
45,40,"He is a shithead. We should be able to get rid of the masks, as well as vaccinate ourselves."
62,40,Its not a joke if it isn't part of the ACA. It's a joke if it isn't.
65,40,It isn't going to make a difference in what's happening.
66,40,he has a pretty good understanding of what he is doing and is a troll
72,40,"YES! This is a very interesting piece, I really liked that movie. It seems like the movie was a clever way to do things and you just put up a pretty good show involving the government and the people that created them."
75,40,>I'm going to say this about twitchcon and masks
78,40,"When a public health organization and the government are in danger for preventing a virus, there will be a prank going on."
95,40,It is kind of weird to think this is all a satire of a book
96,40,I have never seen a spooky head masked. It looks like a mask - a mask that's just so uncomfortably messy.
97,40,"If it's not a big deal, the article seems to suggest that it's a bigger thing. The articles have not explained this in detail, though."
40,6,He's getting the message that a 'compelling' is a joke and it's not. If you are going to take it as a joke you can't actually make it a joke.
40,7,i agree that the guy is a hater
40,16,>How does the mask make his breath come out of the back of his head? It's a joke about the CIA and the CDC destroying people's lives by giving them a mask to wear during a war.
40,23,Using masks to keep people from going is very inconvenient.
40,31,I don't even have any knowledge of this movie.
40,32,I really like the title of this thread.
40,36,"I read this a lot in the book. But to the point I think you were being really in the wrong. The NSA is the one that has been at the heart of the whole thing, and the CDC is not a part of it."
40,38,"Considering that the CDC is supposed to get rid of masks in order to keep this going, I doubt it's really the issue at hand, or he's trying to convince them that he doesn't have much information about it."
41,40,"Are you a child, or a woman, or a doctor?"
45,40,"I grew up with a guy named Donald J. Trump. He's a great guy. He's a great guy. And yes, this movie is pretty good."
62,40,"In my opinion, it's not a joke that people don't want to give people something to talk about. They're talking about the state government, which is not what's being manipulated and the ACA is aimed at."
65,40,Using a mask to prevent AIDS is a prank.
66,40,>(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirituality-of-Immunition-and-Living-In-Family/Spiritual-of-Immunition/)
72,40,I didn't see a link but the original title was just a screenshot.
75,40,I'd be a little disappointed if I didn't read this. I would like to read more.
78,40,Well I've got a bunch of friends and family.
95,40,"I think it's strange to think the film is better than the book. ""I am going to make a mask for a girl, and I want to wear it on her."""
96,40,CANNOTANSWER'S INJURY WAS OVER THE ASSESSMENT OF A CHILD.
97,40,"It's like saying ""I don't understand why you're downvoted."" Regardless of what the headline is saying, OP is a very smart person and I've got a hard time believing that it's a joke."
40,6,'The CIA and the CDC are supposed to get rid of masks in order to keep this going'
40,7,"In the movie, they say ""Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
40,16,I would have been more offended if they had made it a joke.
40,23,CANNOTANSWER'S INJURY WAS OVER THE ASSESSMENT OF A CHILD.
40,31,"CANNOTANSWER'S INJURY WAS OVER THE ASSESSMENT OF A CHILD. It's like saying ""I don't understand why you're downvoted."" Regardless of what the headline is saying, OP is a very smart person and I've got a hard time believing that it's a joke."
40,32,He got it. The CDC and the CIA are involved in a conflict.
40,36,"Probably the most naive thing I've read. This is actually pretty fucked up, IMO. I'm hoping to find a guy who doesn't have a mask."
40,38,"CANNOTANSWER'S INJURY WAS OVER THE ASSESSMENT OF A CHILD. It's like saying ""I don't understand why you're downvoted."""
41,40,People need to realize that they aren't being a hero because of the fact that the NSA is making a film about AIDS.
45,40,I'm sure the satire in the article is a bit harsh and doesn't sound funny. It's an important one.
62,40,"CANNOTANSWER: ""Hey, I think that's a joke. I thought that's a joke. He said ""Hey, I thought that's a joke""."
65,40,"I think the problem isn't just the stigma, but the stigma attached to it. I think it's about how stigmas in a person can cause people to feel insecure or unable to take care of themselves."
66,40,CANNOTANSWER: I'm not against the ACA. There's no veto of it. There's no veto. It's a veto of a single piece of legislation.
72,40,"...it's funny that the guy wearing the mask isn't really funny or funny, if the movie were written in such a way that I wouldn't mind seeing it."
75,40,I read a lot of stuff about the Obama administration. It was really good reading. It was a good book.
78,40,"I don't understand you. This is the one that makes the whole Obama administration feel stupid. They are incompetent, they can't take care of the problem and I'm sorry, they are not trying to solve the problem. The idea of a mask is a joke, I think it is a joke. It's a joke. Is it a joke? It is a joke."
95,40,"I love reading books. So, you're the kind of kid that enjoys movies? I get that it is a good movie, but what's your favorite?"
96,40,I don't want to think about it but I could see how this might be a pretty major issue for his family.
97,40,I think that ''Say what you want'' is the best way to go about it.
40,6,"There are a ton of movies about the CDC and AIDS which have been made about the ACA, but the movie is a pretty good example of the NSA doing a better job at it."
40,7,What are the main points of the movie?
40,16,"The US government has done more than just pass an ACA, and they have already vetoed it. The only way to stop it is by making it more clear that they don't want to go through with it."
40,23,"It's really only a joke that the CIA isn't really involved in any kind of policy. But if it's a joke, I'll be pretty upset because I'm the kind of kid who enjoys movies."
40,31,I read this article and it seemed like the only one I could recall being completely offended. It sounds like the whole thing was going through a lot of guts.
40,32,"It's actually pretty fucked up, IMO. I'm hoping to find a guy who doesn't have a mask."
40,36,It's also a joke about his family.
40,38,"CANNOTANSWER is one of the few that actually thinks it is ""nothing special"" in the US, although it doesn't quite say it is in the CDC's best interests to avoid saying it is a dummy issue and it doesn't have a purpose."
41,40,The joke isn't a joke. It's an issue.
45,40,He has the job. He has the responsibility to fight it.
62,40,This is why the ACA is a joke.
65,40,"If there's an issue, it's the mask and a mask, not a mask. There's no need to stop using a mask when there is a serious, unforeseen health problem."
66,40,"Yes, the government is trying to stop the spread of AIDS."
72,40,"""The movie is trying to create an interesting idea with some kind of ""trick"" and/or ""trick"" based on a real story. I think it's a good movie. I don't know who the person in question was. ""...I just don't think it's the right of the government to make it a crime to use a mask to prevent SARS."""
75,40,Vaccines are one of the best ways to prevent the spread of a virus. People are sick of talking to their friends and family about how a mask is helping them get the virus.
78,40,So the CDC isn't gonna put this in place?
95,40,I want to wear a mask on my friend's friend. I just want to tell her it's not about her. Is she going to wear the mask in a smhh?
96,40,"I'd recommend a tv show about a guy who doesn't wear a mask when he's playing basketball. There's a lot of interesting things about it, including the obvious 'if you don't know what a mask looks like in a game, they just want a head sleeve or something. In addition to being a part of the NSA to stop the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask outside or in your car alone is part of the measures deployed by the government to stop the spread of a virus."
97,40,"""The president is a fantastic athlete and an amazing player. He should put on a mask and play football. Yes. If they don't see the issue, then they won't get enough votes to make a statement. I think we need to do something about it."
40,6,I didn't mean to put it any more into the movie.
40,7,"As a CDC official and not a CDC official, I don't see the point of making a joke."
40,16,"Then why doesn't the president wear a mask when he's out? You don't have a job, and he's a kid. That's the only reason."
40,23,"I'm not a politician or anything, I'm a lawyer or any other person that supports the CDC. Is it a joke? No. I'm not an expert on the CDC. No, I'm not an expert on the CDC, nor do I even think about what the CDC does. Is it a joke or just some thing you could possibly point out that's an understatement?"
40,31,I'd rather watch the movie and not watch it. I read a ton of things about the movie and not see the movie at all. I'd rather watch a movie about the CDC and AIDS.
40,32,"i know there is a lot of nonsense going on here, and they need to put this in a video because he is a fucking joke about a 'commentary' on the CIA and the CIA. but i'm really surprised the cia and the cdc are going to try to do something about it."
40,36,The CDC is not a part of the ACA.
40,38,"I think you've missed the point of the article. I'd have been looking for the op's perspective and found a guy who doesn't wear a mask. It's kind of odd to think that it's a joke, but it's actually really interesting and interesting to think about."
41,40,The CDC are trying to get people to change their ACA to help prevent the spread of a virus and I'm going to say that's ridiculous.
45,40,"Vaccination is not a joke. The President is not trying to make people believe it. The President is merely trying to help, which is a terrible idea."
62,40,''I don't think the president should wear a mask because I'm not a big fan of the ACA.''
65,40,>I think the problem isn't just the stigma attached to it. What is the problem isn't just the stigma attached to it.
66,40,“I think I am a troll because I don’t want to be in control of my own business”
72,40,"A man's right to be scared of people is a troll's right, so I guess he is not one."
75,40,"[CANNOTANSWER](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candidate_) It's a very good movie, and I'm sure there are some very decent people in there who aren't 'police' enough to say anything that seems to be the correct answer."
78,40," I'm sorry, they are not trying to solve the problem. The idea of a mask is a joke."
95,40,"I love movies, I like the book, but when I see movies with a mask, I don't like the book."
96,40,"CANNOTANSWER: I love coaching however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask when he's playing basketball. There are people who don't know what a mask looks like in a game, they just want a head sleeve or something. In addition to being a part of the NSA to stop the spread of a virus."
97,40,IANAL but if a person is actually sick they would be able to play at home so it wouldn't be a problem.
40,6,This movie is all about the CDC and not the ACA itself.
40,7,There is a lot of nonsense going on here. I'm not an expert on the CDC. But I do know the CDC is not a part of the ACA.
40,16,I think a lot of this is based on one of the main arguments in the article:
40,23,>I do not think the president should wear a mask because I'm not a big fan of the ACA.
40,31,Is it because he is a huge supporter of the ACA? I think they're trying to stop a certain type of person from being allowed to wear their mask when the President is not playing a game he is not playing in a hospital. He is trying to make it so he could continue to play. That is a bit ridiculous.
40,32,CANNOTANSWER:
40,36,"I mean that is the point of the article. Mostly I read it as if it was about the CIA and CDC, not the CDC itself."
40,38,"There's an ad in a film where the president doesn't wear a mask to prevent HIV infection, and the ad for the president's helmet is not even on."
41,40,The ACA wasn't a joke. It was a joke.
45,40,"""Donald J. Trump must take off his mask and turn himself in oh and every day he doesn't people will die starting tonight i'm a man of my word covid"""
62,40,"CANNOTANSWER: ""Hey, I think that's a joke. I thought that's a joke. He said ""Hey, I thought that's a joke. He said ""Hey, I thought that's a joke""."
65,40,The CDC didn't say anything about it.
66,40,Vaccines are an incredibly important and effective tool for preventing the spread of a virus.
72,40,Then you gonna go eat my soup.
75,40,I think the actual problem is that people are actually getting vaccinated because they think they're the worst case scenario. The actual problem is that they are actually doing a very good job of preventing a problem like TB/STIs.
78,40,I just wanted to share this with you.
95,40,"The title, ""The Movie is my favorite. I love the movie, I like the book, but when I see movies with a mask, I don't like the book."""
96,40,I can see how it's a big deal. I love the sport but the people that are in it get me mad when they have to fuck around in their own cars and don't show up in the morning to get a mask on or even go through a bathroom window.
97,40,The president is not at fault for a lot of the issues that he has cited.
40,6,"It makes no sense that any government can't help the President do what he can, not only because they're in a position to prevent TB, but because they don't have the funding to get them."
40,7,I think the ACA isn't a joke. It's a joke.
40,16,The President wears a mask to stop the spread of a virus. The CDC has no intention of allowing it to be worn.
40,23,I can see a lot of this with you saying that the CDC's stance on preventing TB/STIs (if any) is an issue.
40,31,I've had several times to hear someone say that I like a joke or a good idea to help a sick person. And I have never thought about them being a big deal.
40,32,I'm going to have to agree with you on this but I'm sure that they are really going to try and do something about it.
40,36,I think the problem is people not being vaccinated.
40,38,You can buy a helmet that has a whistle on it for the head.
41,40,"In my opinion, the ACA was a joke that the CDC and others had to make up to make up to the best possible way to do it. In fact, the CDC made up for it a lot of the times, just not a lot of the times."
45,40,"The movie is about him having a fun time, not playing with it. It is about how he is trying to prevent the spread of an epidemic and how he wants to get back into the hood."
62,40,The pretender: '' is a joke. Its not a joke if it isn't part of the ACA.
65,40,"A mask is a form of health care that is not aimed at anyone, but rather to the population in general."
66,40,They don't have any vetos against ACA. They have vetos against other legislation. The movie is based on a book about the idea that the ACA is part of a larger conspiracy to be a troll.
72,40,"You think I'm an idiot, and I feel stupid for not knowing what the actual context is?"
75,40,"The CDC is going to rename these things ""necessary"". They are calling them ""fake masks."""
78,40,"I think a bit of what you're saying isn't wrong. It's a joke because it's in an ill manner. You should feel better knowing this, though. If you wear a mask to fight the flu, that's a good idea and it's a good idea, too."
95,40,I like a prank. I like a prank. I don't like a prank.

72,40,"It's a satire of a book that was made into a movie about the AIDS epidemic, and the people with AIDS are the one who make it into a movie about a dick joke."
75,40,I've come across this phrase before in my work with our state's health department as a result of a virus infection.
78,40,No joke there. Rather it's just a joke. It's a joke because they're making the ACA a joke.
95,40,"I am not a prank guy, but I am not an asshole. The only reason I like the movie is because I enjoy the movie. I hate it when it's a prank and I don't like a prank. It's kind of weird that I'm being sarcastic. That's just what I know of snark."
96,40,">The only thing I see about the ""masked"" thing is that the masked man is actually a coach."
97,40,It's not a joke. It's a joke.
40,6,">The only thing I see about the ""masked"" thing is that the masked man is actually a coach. It's not a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke."
40,7,The ACA is a joke about it and I'm not sure if it has any actual substance or effect unless someone has made a joke about it.
40,16,A lot of the arguments in this post are basically wrong.
40,23,A joke that's about a CDC and a CDC-esque CDC policy.
40,31,He's a joke to all of the others.
40,32,This is why the ACA is so funny. I thought it would make him cringe a little.
40,36,">Hey, it really did make me cringe a little."" That's like a movie about the CDC and AIDS, and it's funny. The ACA is part of a conspiracy to be a troll....and I think that the ACA is a joke."
40,38,So you fucking aren't talking about the Obama vs the CDC?
41,40,CANNOTANSWER:
45,40,Vaccination is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I don't think anyone here is aware of this. I'm sorry but I am a dick. I think this situation is going to be a dick story. There are so many things people don't understand.
62,40,I agree with you that the ACA is not a bad thing. That's the whole point of the ACA. The purpose of a mask is to stop people from entering the country.
65,40,"We have a CDC system that tries to stop the spread of AIDS by providing access to an entire population. I am not sure how you can argue the existence of a mask, as a joke, isn't a joke."
66,40,"The book was written by a guy who voted to take down the ACA. It's not exactly a veto, it's a veto, it's a veto."
72,40,I thought this was a really good joke.
75,40,I'd like to add that the first comment made me realize that I should have read the second one before I did it.
78,40,a mask is a joke. a joke because the government has made it a joke.
95,40,">I hate it when it's a prank and I don't like a prank. It's kind of weird that I'm being sarcastic. That's just what I know of snark."""
96,40,"It's a prank, the president is a troll."
97,40,"Despite the jokes, the restraining order to wear a helmet is in the article."
40,6,It's a prank.

40,16,">Hey, it really did make me cringe a little."
40,23,"I'm not sure that's what I was referring to. I've been following this whole ACA thing for a while, and even though I'm a big fan of Obama, this is still a joke. Rather than being an idiot about the ACA, I was referring to the fact that the CDC has a bigger job of protecting people than any other agency in the US. Basically, the Obama administration doesn't have a lot of power in the CIA, or any other agency. They are probably the ones who put on a remarking"
40,31,"The ACA was a prank, the CDC was a troll. They were putting on a mask. The CDC was a troll. This is why they are trying to keep people from being able to get to a certain point in their lives. They are trying to limit people from entering the country."
40,32,"The author of the article is a troll, he believes the mask is part of the ACA."
40,36,"I think you are being a dick, because I think you are a dick, because it sounds like you have some really unprofessional sense of humor."
40,38,I think that he's ignoring a lot of the ridiculous things people say in the comment. This is a joke he's trying to make himself known by making a joke about it.
41,40,What is it? Is it a joke that the government will never change their ACA?
45,40,I just thought that I'd be the worst person in the world if I didn't wear a mask. That's not funny.
62,40,It's like when you say a president has a monopoly on the medical community.
65,40,I would never recommend anyone wear a mask on public health - it could make people feel worse - I personally would just don't like that.
66,40,"I'm not gonna read this book or the book, but I would probably buy it if I were you."
72,40,It's not the movie.
75,40,What is the name of the movie?
78,40,Is the ACA a joke? Is it a joke?
95,40,"""As someone who has been a prankster since age 12 I love movies. So, you're the kind of kid that enjoys movies?"""
96,40,"I hate the president. It is a prank and not a joke. It is an act of kindness, and it's not funny."
97,40,The restraining order to wear a helmet should not be a joke because it is not a joke because it is part of the measures deployed by the government to stop the spread of AIDS.
40,6,A lot of people have commented on the ACA.
40,7,I wouldn't call the ACA a prank. Just because you're a fan doesn't mean you're being funny.
40,16,"A lot of the arguments in this post are basically wrong. ""Hey, it really did make me cringe a little. I'm not an expert on r/police', 'if your in the nfc and i have no idea what i have you could just call me out on this."""

40,31,"It sounds like the CDC and CDC were really talking about a sick kid and the ACA was just a joke about that as well.

40,16,"The first person to say that the ACA is part of the government is a prankster, a snide joke. It is also a joke about the CDC not wanting to put the ACA on the president, and a prankster joke about the president not wanting to do it."
40,23,"I'd be really happy to see the movie. I don't mind people putting on masks, but the idea that it's something the CDC isn't trying to do is crazy. It would be a much better idea to give an official aide the time and resources to go into a more comprehensive study."
40,31,"I'm a huge fan of the ACA, but the CDC is not the only one that has actually done this. It would probably be good for the president to have something like this when he was sick, and that is just what he did."

The CDC had a role to play when preventing the spread of the virus and also had a role in the ACA, because they weren't able to get people sick.

40,16,This is a joke. That's not a joke. The President is at fault for the ACA and the government is being a prankster.
40,23,I think it's really funny how some people think that the CDC is the only agency in the US that does a serious job in preventing the spread of the ACA. [The CDC is going to make it into a video. I think that it's pretty much a joke.
40,31,"In my opinion, a lot of people have no idea what a joke is, because they know that a CDC is a joke and they are trying to try and stop a CDC from using it to help prevent spread of HIV/AIDS. They are using it to prevent spreading HIV and AIDS."

75,40,I think that's one way to respond.
78,40,There's actually a real problem with the fact that it doesn't address the problem of AIDS.
95,40,This is a generalisation. The book is based off of a book. There is a lot of pranks.
96,40,"Is this some sort of troll or a joke? It's like saying that if the president is willing to change his ways, he's not a prankster."
97,40,The fact that he's being punished is not a joke.
40,6,The CDC's clone is also part of the ACA.

40,31,"It seems like all the people you're comparing to are actually actually going to be comparing the actual CDC to the CDC, and that despite the fact that the CDC has been trying to protect the CDC and the ACA, the CDC has been implementing a lot of ridiculous policies that have been in place to keep the CDC from going after those who are not a part of the CDC, while allowing other people to have a job and not be allowed to have sex."
40,32,"So what you're trying to do is tell him to go on a trip to CDC to get a new one? That's a joke and a joke, is it?"
40,36,...I think he is a prankster.
40,38,It's just a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke because you don't think it's funny.

66,40,I think that's a good thing. I don't think there's enough information to be able to tell the difference between the ACA and the ACA.
72,40,It's funny because it's just a joke. And it's also funny because it's about the guy wearing a hat and they have a deal that the CDC and CDC are making a film about it to avoid it.
75,40,"This is pretty crappy, but this is a valid point. There is a big difference between a prank, and a joke. A prank is a joke. It has a lot of negative things to do with the ACA and it makes a lot of people feel the shit they do. The CDC is just trying to make a joke out of this. And so they're trying to push the ACA."
78,40,Why does the CDC need a therapist? I think it's a joke for them to put on a mask because it addresses the problem of HIV?

66,40,I agree that it's a good idea to wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus.
72,40,The entire moral of the movie is that the whole idea of wearing a hat isn't a good idea.

78,40,"I’m not a joke, but I’m a joke. AIDS is a very serious illness. You need to be vaccinated. You need to protect yourself against it. You need to make sure you are doing the right thing.
