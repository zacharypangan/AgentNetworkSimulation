    "As a vaccinated person, I am not sure if we can have an absolute right to make sure we are not putting on a mask. But I would be mad if I were in a hospital where they don't want us doing anything.",
    "I've been in Colorado for over a decade, but I have not been to Twitchcon. The fact that you are not a vaccinate has nothing to do with your insurance policy, the fact that you have a CDC mandate to take you to the event does not mean they have mandates in your state.",
    "A mask is a mask you don't need. It's the easiest and fastest way to get vaccinated. It's not just that people wear them, it's that people get more info about it than if they had to wear a mask. Vaccines aren't that easy to get vaccinated, they're too difficult to get a vaccination. The thing you don't understand is how the people you are talking about are calling it bad and I'm not sure what the person who said, but they are not being that stupid in the video",

    "It's pretty ridiculous to be called the best way to prevent TB/STIs and it makes you think the people who have a history of having them in their health are actually really ill or dying. I'm saying the mask thing makes sense and it will be used to stop it.",
    "You're just making a joke. Basically, I'm just giving a few words to you.",
    "This is the correct subreddit. The best part of the story is it doesn't matter what it says. The article suggests that I'm an idiot and that the CDC doesn't care about my health. They know it's about preventing TB/STIs and don't want to tell the world I'm an idiot or the people I know do it.",
    "I'm the biggest sailor...",
    "I don't know if it's a joke or a joke. But I think a few words to you is the right way to look at it. I just think it's a joke and there's just too much information. Vaccines are the best way to prevent TB/STIs. Vaccines are the best way to stop the spread of a virus.",
    "No, it's not. It's not. The CDC has no real reason to care about a situation like this. There's nothing wrong with it.",

    "My dad and I went to Twitchcon together when I was a kid. We got to know each other very well and we went to various events and it was the best part. We made the decision on our own. But the problem was that we never had a choice and opted out over health issues. We couldn't even afford to go to the events.",

    "I'm just giving you a few words to you.",
    "What happened with the CDC? How did they handle this, and why did they do it?",
    "I'm just saying that the CDC has a duty to address the issue. The idea of getting vaccinated is what the CDC is doing. CDC has a duty to treat people with diseases that are potentially potentially serious. If you have a serious health issue you have to discuss it with a doctor or a health professional.",
    "It's not just that people wear masks. It's that people aren't actually getting vaccinated. Vaccines are not health issues. Vaccines and STIs are not the same thing. Vaccines and STIs are not health issues. Vaccines and STIs are not the same thing.",
    "It's a really good movie, a funny one and a great one. I'm not the most stupid person in the world.",
    "I'm sure this is a pretty good reason to avoid vaccination as well. Vaccines are a huge part of vaccination policies in America, but there's a huge gap between people getting the vaccine in a country without a healthcare system and people who don't.",
    "Vaccines are the best way to stop the spread of a virus. You need to go to the CDC and be vaccinated. Vaccines are not a health issue.",
    "I can't imagine the time it would have taken them that long to realize that they are a medical problem and the situation would be different if the vaccines are a health issue and the public doesn't want to see that.",
    "In my experience, people who want to be protected don't want to wear masks. They want to be vaccinated, and they have to get in there and talk to a doctor. This would be a prank. The people who don't want to get vaccinated should not wear a mask.",
    "It was a prank, they are still trying to stop the spread of the disease.",
    "The best part is it's a good movie, a funny one and a great one.",
    "The best part is it is a good movie, a funny one and a great one.",
    "I thought this was the best part of it.",
    "The CDC doesn't have the authority to do anything, they do. It has a duty to prevent the spread of diseases. The CDC is doing something, that they can do, but it's not going to stop it. It's going to stop it. It is going to stop it. I can't imagine how they will treat people who aren't being vaccinated. It is going to stop it.",
    "That is exactly what I'm getting at. You're making a joke and saying it's just a prank. I don't think the point is to be completely overbearing, but there's nothing wrong with it.",

    "The best part is that I think the CDC needs to fix the problem.",
    "I'm a vaccinated person, and I've never worn a mask. I was in the hospital with people who needed to come to the party or to do anything about it. The people were sick and dying. I was wearing a mask to get vaccinated. I'm in the hospital and no one knows what the CDC means. That's what's happening.",
    "Yes, they are trying to stop the spread of the virus in the U.S. It is not a health issue and that is not a prank.",
    "I mean, this CDC is a good thing and not a bad thing, but they don't want to say anything. The fact that people aren't getting vaccinated is a really big rip off.",
    "The best part is what you're saying. \"The only thing that makes me think that the CDC isn't doing a good job of preventing the spread of a virus is that the people who don't want to get vaccinated aren't getting vaccinated. They aren't really doing anything about it.\"",
    "I've seen this movie multiple times. I know it's a joke. I also know it's a rip off. I'm not sure how people get to say that people are stupid or the most stupid person in the world.",

    "I think that's the part that is so stupid and messes with the CDC that it's gonna be in a pretty good place.",
    "This is a very important discussion that people seem to have in the past, and it is a common misunderstanding that the CDC is trying to prevent the spread of AIDS. I don't know about it, but the guy with the mask who was on the date and was with the other person in the event was very upset and got in trouble for doing a CDC job with the government, which is why the CDC isn't doing it.",
