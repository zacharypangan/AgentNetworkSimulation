80,50,"I think you should stop playing the game because you are not wearing a mask and you have no choice but to wear a mask if you do not want to wear it, and you should be allowed to do that and have your life ruined by it."
81,50,It s not a helmet that should be in public. You should be in public.

50,23,"The government has done a nutshell about the virus, and it's not a question of whether or not they should have to go through the entire government stoop of vaccinating people. The idea that the people who are at risk are sick is a bit ridiculous."
50,27,"The CDC (Did you hear about that before you said it? ), they have a list of anti-viral measures in place. If anyone has said anything they'll come back and do it on their own without further notice."

74,50,"If you're sick of the virus, you might want to check your medical records. I don't see any evidence of them spreading it on the internet."
80,50,"Isn't it because there are people on the net who don't know what the fuck they're talking about? Like, if you're a kid and you're going to have a bad time in front of your parents, why do you care? Why is fucking the game fun? Why is it fun to get in the face of that?"
81,50,I had a friend who would put on a mask for me at a party. She was also a woman. He was not wearing a mask because of some reason.

86,50,"Is this an example of a lack of proper protection? It's pretty common to find people in a wheelchair and can't walk with their hands on their head and make their hair fall and fall. It's called ""I am a man of my word""."
101,50,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
50,3,"The term ""Making"" is pretty vague. A person can not see a human face at a restaurant. It's like saying you're not a man of your word, but that you've made a living."
50,6,No. He has done the fucking nutshell thing.
50,23,You're going to get sick from trying to fight a virus.
50,27,I do not have a good understanding of that because I don't think the article is stating that there is some sort of a lack of proper protection. I firmly believe that vaccines do nothing to stop the spread of the virus. The president is in the wrong.
50,42,"A mask is a sign that you will pass it on when you reach the medical center. It's called ""I am a man of my word""."

74,50,"This guy is just getting in trouble for saying this he can't stop wearing his mask because it's causing a fever.

64,50,There's a lot of the same problems and problems.
74,50,This is one of the biggest problems we have with the government.
80,50,I don't understand how there is a national security system where people can play sports without a mask or to wear a mask.
81,50,The fact that this is a joke is an even more disturbing one because there are so many other ways that a person is not wearing a mask because of fear and fear in other ways than if they were to be an adult.
86,50,"People like this sub have to apologise for the kind words they tell you about ""This is how crazy trump made the United States of America"" and ""There are people who wear masks, but don't think wearing a mask is enough to prevent the spread of a virus."""

50,6,It's a huge issue and there are some things you can do to help it spread.
50,23,I'm glad the topic of the discussion started. I just had a few thoughts on this.
50,27,"In a sense, it's a kind of stupid joke."
50,42,I was vaccinated twice and I didn't take a picture. I guess it's the biggest problem for the US economy to keep a virus.
64,50,I like that the NSA is in the middle of talking to the CDC about this. Is there a possibility they are sending a message to the CDC?
74,50,It sounds like the government has a problem with the government and if it's not working then it can't be a problem.
80,50,"I think the problem is that if a lot of kids play sports on the internet without their masks, they will not notice the problem. I think this is what sexist is, and i know that a lot of people have no idea what sex is, and there are also a lot of people that do not have sex with masks. The fact that this is true is all you need to know."
81,50,I love reading this. What you're saying is funny.
86,50,"That's the problem with the post, not with the rest of us. I'm not going to put in any more comments on this. I've been playing a game with Donald Trump for 10 years now. I think I am going to put some more effort into getting him back into his lane and keep him out of the house."

80,50,"I don't see why you're suggesting a specific definition of ""must wear a mask,"" as in a mask to protect yourself from infections. I don't think it's worth noting that some of the same things you're saying are true for every other category - that some people have a tendency to be anti-virus because they believe that if they don't, their health will not be as bad as what they think they are. That's a bit odd because, in general, it would be funny to tell people about the government to do that. The"
81,50,The problem is the NSA is using that to control the AIDS epidemic – they are trying to take advantage of it by using a fake health insurance policy for people with AIDS who can't get access to health care – in order to try to prevent this from happening.

64,50,"You gotta pay for the mask, right?"
74,50,They don't like to wear masks. They don't like to give them away. They don't like the idea of having a government that control the way they live. They have a problem with how they talk. They don't want to control people. And they want to control the way people think.
80,50,"The guy you write this for sounds like someone who's actually on some kind of ""dark comedy"" sort of thing. Not the kind of thing where the guy tries to talk about AIDS, but just trying to talk about it."

So I don't know if you're trying to be funny, or if you are trying to be nice. But if you don't want to talk about the disease I don't think it will be good to make fun of Trump."

50,27,"I don't see that they don't want to do a'mockable' cover for the AIDS virus, i.e., putting a picture of yourself in a camera."
50,42,The president isn't in the right but he's in the right. The CDC isn't bad at addressing a problem with AIDS. The fact that it's a government problem does not change this.
64,50,The article was also written by a lawyer who is currently in the middle of doing the CIA investigation. It was sarcastic.
74,50,"I don't know what the joke is. if people would really like to see the movie, they should watch it."

I'm sure the medical industry can make money from it. But I'm sure there are still people who want to see their friends get vaccinated without insurance. They can't tell you who they are to prevent or not, which makes it harder to see."
50,6,"I walked through an AIDS outbreak and there were signs that the CDC and CDC could not stop it, and there is no way he could get vaccinations. He's a hiccup. The CDC is making fun of him for not being able to do it but the problem is that people don't have access to it."
50,23,"Yes, they are a legitimate way to protect people from AIDS."
50,27,Is this a joke or is it a joke?
50,42,I'm a bit confused by what it sounds like in the article. I don't know where it comes from.
64,50,"The fact that a lot of these people are wearing masks, especially since they don't have medical insurance, is absolutely irrelevant. It sounds like they are able to make a good deal of money in a way that isn't harmful to their health or well being. There is a lot of research that suggests that it is not. There is no evidence that any medical doctor would be able to prevent it. I see the difference between the two films. The ACA is going to be a very expensive medical system."
74,50,I think the movie is actually a satire of the book that is the same as the one in The Spectre. I think they've got good arguments for both putting in a mask and using it to stop the spread of the virus.

50,27,>[I think it's not necessary to be a troll and therefore not an opportunist to go out on a limb and not actually read it - but I don't think the president would want to wear a mask.

50,6,I don't think people are making fun of the fact that the president has to wear a mask in order to get vaccinated. The CDC is trying to prevent a huge problem that isn't related to AIDS. They have no authority in what is happening and who are responsible for the disease. And the CDC have been reporting it before.

50,27,"It's a joke, but they're not talking about what's actually going on. And it is. But in this case the joke is actually a joke. The president doesn't really know what to do and it just feels awkward because his life is ruined."

It sounds like they are able to make a good deal of money in a way that isn't harmful to their health or well being. There is no evidence that any medical doctor would be able to prevent it. I see the difference between the two films. The ACA isn't a disaster.

50,6,"The CDC and CDC do have to have access to the Internet. In fact, there are several ways to do so."
50,23,I'm pretty sure the entire point of this post is that Obama was trying to turn people's perceptions into a way to be more informed about how the president is in the world. It's a very silly thing to do - you're literally imagining him with his face and your mouth and it's a joke. He didn't actually get the point - he made a silly joke and put his face on top of that.

50,42,Those are the key words that have been used for a few years. The CDC is working on repealing the ACA and getting people to get better care.

64,50,The author of this piece is an idiot.
74,50,They're not a joke.
80,50,"No one should be allowed to wear a mask if they do not want to see the results of a vaccine, and if they do, they have no right to be aware of it and it's not acceptable. I've seen someone who had no choice, because the government has already decided to try to stop the spread of a virus, and the NSA wants to stop the spread of one."
81,50,"It's actually kind of interesting that they are trying to manipulate the media into thinking he is actually being a joke, not a prank."
86,50,It was one of the most ridiculous pranks I've ever read.
101,50,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
50,3,"It would be nice if the CDC took the risk of being called a prank, even though they can be really bad at it. Then they would be like ""Of course, it's a joke to do that!"""
50,6,The article is clearly based on facts from the CDC and the CDC's website.
50,23,Then you read my post about how Obama's trying to get everyone to be more informed about the health care system and a bunch of people trying to think he is a joke.
50,27,So...the CDC and the CDC don't even have an article on that?
50,42,In a word: the Obama administration
64,50,That's all you can do.
74,50,"The government is supposed to prevent and combat the spread of the virus. A lot of people get sick from wearing a mask, because people are sick from the disease. The hat is meant to help people. It is a joke."
80,50,It's funny you don't have any idea what the big deal is and how you can't tell it without it.
81,50,If you don't know the guy then don't take it to him - he may have something to hide.
86,50,I'm going to try and tell people what I am trying to say but I don't think that would work.
101,50,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
50,3,The CDC isn't trying to stop the spread of AIDS. Vaccines are definitely the best way to stop the spread.
50,6,"Yes, this is a big problem that's not about the vaccine. But if he wears a mask you get the problem. There is no real reason why he can't have a virus, but that's because he doesn't have the vaccination."
50,23,The CDC has already decided that masks are the only way to stop AIDS and that they're not the only option.
50,27,It seems like the president will do this to me.
50,42,"As you stated, this is one of the most ridiculous things I've ever read. I'm confused about the CDC."
64,50,"I'm sorry, the prankster ain't a lawyer."
74,50,I think we can all agree that it's not about the government or the healthcare system.
80,50,I think the whole notion of a mask has nothing to do with why it's a sexist idea. You are just trying to make an opinion about the government.

64,50,This is why we need to stop the ACA from being passed with a bunch of hoaxes. The president needs to know this: 'The ACA is the best way to stop the spread of HIV. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of HIV. Please wear masks. I don't see how he could be a prankster. The president is just a prankster.
74,50,The hat is a satire of the book The Spectre. It is about how the CDC has dealt with the healthcare system.

74,50,"The hat is a joke, a movie."
80,50,I don't think you understand what the point of a mask is. It is to prevent the spread of a virus. So I would say that a mask is good enough to prevent the spread of a virus.

50,3,The movie is about the CDC being able to prevent a large number of people from getting vaccinated. The movie is about the president being able to prevent people from getting sick from a mask. What the CDC is trying to do is allowing people to go to the doctor without insurance.
50,6,"People have a lot to worry about. The president is probably the one making fun of the government, not the CDC.

50,6,"Unless you're a doctor, and it's a sham / rap, you won't get a good vaccine."
50,23,I can't believe how much of this was a joke and how much sexist the CDC is.
50,27,This is just an opinion piece.
50,42,"They're denying him the ACA, but they're denying him the Obama administration's role in this. The ACA is in full swing, because of the government's policies, and the fact that it will go away when it gets repealed."
64,50,The movie and the book are not the only examples of how the administration is trying to influence the administration.

50,3,Yes. Vaccines are definitely the best way to stop AIDS. It's a joke.
50,6,"""We don't have access to the Internet. They said it to the government to stop the spread of a virus, they have not done it yet."""
50,23,"As a doctor who has gotten vaccinated to a lot of AIDS and he doesn't think it's possible, I think he needs to wear a mask more often. It could mean a lot more than a mask."
50,27,Getting a good dick and a hat is no joke. Having a mask in a mask can be done to get a virus. A prank that is not actually a joke isn't a joke.
50,42,"Because the issue is that the CDC is trying to stop the spread of AIDS. The idea of having a mask that can be seen as a good way to stop AIDS is so crazy that it's kind of depressing if the CDC is trying to stop a large number of people from getting vaccinated. This isn't the same as not wanting to get vaccinated, and isn't a good way to stop the spread of AIDS. Using a mask, e.g. a doctor, and getting vaccinated"
