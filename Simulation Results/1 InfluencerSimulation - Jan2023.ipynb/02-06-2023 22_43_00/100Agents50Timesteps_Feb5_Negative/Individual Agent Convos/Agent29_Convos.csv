52,29,"You mean the two resigning board members from Douglas County that voted against the mask public health order because they were not allowed to vote? Because if they did, then it would be a bad idea to sign up to be in charge of Douglas County for such a small number of counties."
56,29,You are so dumb to say it. You know what is causing the racial tension in the military?
59,29,It s just a nitpick about getting vaccinated.
66,29,I am a politician. It is in the hands of the people in charge of health care to stop people from having sex. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

29,1,You are being so over-the-top that it becomes a joke that I feel like it's not very good to be the guy in charge of our healthcare.
34,29,"I think that the 'right to safety' thing isn't a good way to explain that a mask does suck, but it makes a lot of sense when it comes to health."
41,29,I think a lot of people here have the opposite retort.

59,29,It's really not a nitpick. There are many more people in Georgia who are allergic to HIV than they are in the U.S.
66,29,Why is he being disrespectful? It's his job to prevent the spread of a virus. That's why he is wearing a mask and not being able to tell you how to keep him safe.

101,29,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
29,1,You have to be at the very least aware of the potential dangers associated with having a mask on.
34,29,"They want to say, “When a president dies in the absence of a mask, they don’t have to protect themselves. They have to be vaccinated.” Obviously, the other rules are not to prevent the spread of a virus and that they should have a safety camera in case someone is hit by a floppy disk or another floppy disk. I think if you are in a position to take control of a floppy disk and do that without one, you can be vaccination. You should be okay if you aren’"
41,29,I think a lot of people here have the opposite retort.
42,29,I am not saying that a 'pills of a virus' is an excuse for wearing a mask.
52,29,I don't know what the difference is.
56,29,"> The government wants a real solution to its own problems, and they are not willing to work hard on them."
59,29,"So if you can't say that about someone who is allergic to HIV, do you have a choice between wearing a mask or a mask? Because that's not how you want to be viewed and what you need to look for?"
66,29,I feel that the President and his staff should be in a position to help prevent some of the people from having sex. Apparently he is trying to do the right thing and the government is vetoing the government's anti-viral meds.
68,29,">What do you mean ""wearing your mask when i wear my mask when i wear my mask when i go to the gym."" You mean ""shouting to your team""?"

85,29,I'm not a shady guy and I live in Georgia.
86,29,"Unless someone has done something bad with the mask, you don't need to wear it. If it's a terrible idea, you probably shouldn't wear it."
90,29,"I'm really on the fence. I think I'm going to go out of my way to say that I don't think a single person has a right to be in a public space. The mask is for a reason, it's for someone. They are not really going to save the people who wear a mask. That's very unfair."
95,29,"It's called an ""advice"" when it comes to protecting yourself from a virus. I'm not sure how that could be true for the guy with the mask. The film is one of the best in the movie."

34,29,Is it possible the floppy disk was floppy by an unintentional floppy?
41,29,I have no idea why you are sarcastic. I feel like you are a moron and should make fun of yourself.
42,29,"I'm going to throw this into the conversation as if this guy is joking. In my experience a mask is not a bad thing. You have to be in a different state. The president is in the wrong. I'd like to be able to say that I love the state of Georgia and have a lot of friends from here who are allergic to HIV. I mean, I understand how you feel, but i would not want a kid with a reversible disease who needs a mask, and"
52,29,The Doctor said they had a problem because he didn't have enough insurance. Apparently that's because he's going to have to be a very strong man for the next ten years.
56,29,"OP is a nut who loves to tell people ""I know the rules of war"" but the problem is that we don't respect the rules of war or their actions. It's like saying that you think 'Mallets' are the worst thing to do and that you're not the best person on the planet."
59,29,"It's not a nitpick that you think 'putting on a mask' is a nitpick. People have to put on masks, to avoid spreading a disease. The people in Georgia who are allergic to HIV are merely making assumptions about what they want to do - it's not a nitpick to put on a mask and not the people who are allergic to HIV. It's not a nitpick to say ""I want to stay here for the sake of being vaccinate my husband in a room at our"
66,29,I would tell a politician if he had a problem with sex. Because I think it is an infection that he might have from being in the hospital. He has a problem with sex and the disease is so serious he is going to need a vaccinated anti-viral. You may also want to consult a doctor about this.
68,29,>The question is why do you have to wear a mask in the workplace? Do you just do it when you're not in the office?

86,29,"I don't know about the other replies, but I do know that this is in context, a post that was downvoted by people in this sub that don't think they are serious about the topic in general, but is a sub with the underlying message that this is a public health problem."
90,29,"Yes, but the whole idea is very outdated, so why not do the ACA so people don't have to be at all scared of the people who haven't gotten tested for HIV? I don't think there's really anything wrong with being told that the health care industry wants to do the same but I do think there's a lot of stupid stupid people out there."
95,29,I like the movie because it's funny but I don't care what he says. I think the woman has been forced to wear a mask in a lot of the movies.

There are several reasons to remove the mask from public health practices, like ensuring the health of the patient."
56,29,The point is that the US government needs to go after their own problems and avoid them.
59,29,This is what the GOP is trying to make a point. They have little to do with the way things are. The Republicans are blatantly repressing.
66,29,"I'm not saying you should not wear a mask, but this is a good idea. I am not a politician, but that doesn't mean he should wear one."
68,29,This isn't the same thing as being told not to wear a mask at a football game in the US. It's a way of doing things like wearing a mask in front of your face to stop a virus spreading.
80,29,This is a good post.
85,29,I would love to read the article to you.
86,29,>Is this an example of a lack of proper protection?
90,29,The movie is excellent. I enjoy watching it as a good example of the ACA.

42,29,>I'm going to throw this into the conversation as if this guy is joking.
52,29,This was a joke. The ACA has nothing to do with public health.
56,29,The whole government has a lot of work to do. You can't make a policy with an insurance company without it.
59,29,I've read a lot of interesting things about the US government. I think it’s really annoying how it takes so many people to get vaccinated. It seems like a bit of a big deal to me.
66,29,I was about to say something about the ACA being a huge failure and it's the biggest political challenge.
68,29,"This is an infrequent, but highly important, joke."
80,29,I agree with the other commenters here. You have a right to express your opinions and beliefs in the way the NSA and the military are doing.

''Making it '' is a very common medical term used by the government."
