38,20,yes the newest strain is soooooo contagious just bc they have a mask on their hands pics don t mean they re using it
46,20,oh man you should come to georgia it s like people here think wearing a mask gives them covid there s so few
52,20,two tri county health dept board members from douglas county voted against the mask public health order and one did not vote due to affiliation to a school
58,20,i love coaching however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops
66,20,how does the mask make his breath come out of the back of his head
79,20,how does the mask make his breath come out of the back of his head
34,20,[i'm a man of my word covid]
38,20,"I feel like we should ask the health department for clarification on what is being done, then get to the root cause and ask for clarification on this issue."
46,20,Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of a virus. Please wear masks.
52,20,I can't believe that the newest strain has been able to spread by itself and spread by the state.
58,20,"If they don't work, get out and talk to people about it."
66,20,i think this guy got his head out of his ass and blew his nose off. that and a mask is gonna be awful to wear.
79,20,"What's the name of this video? I read it somewhere on the internet, and it doesn't appear to be a movie."
34,20,"I can't imagine that being a man of my word does not help him because of his mentality, but because of the fact that he doesn't wear a mask."
38,20,This has to be something that needs to be clarified.
46,20,Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of a virus. Please wear masks.
52,20,"So, I'm sorry you couldn't afford a hoodie, but if someone wearing a mask can't wear one, I'd definitely resign?"
58,20,Yes. The CDC needs to make a CDC rule that they don't make mandatory wearing of masks.
66,20,"The Vaccine Act, or the Preventive Medicine Act, is a violation of your constitutional rights. It's the best way to stop a virus from spreading."
79,20,The whole thing seems to go into great detail with the government not doing anything to stop it.
34,20,This is a good topic and I'm here for you.
38,20,[This has to be something that needs to be clarified.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violent-viruses).
46,20,"This is what happened when I was a teenager. A person who would lie and claim they were infected with the virus was infected with it. Then there were the folks that were ill from that time. I believe that, because of the public health problem they aren't getting it. I think that s the real problem, because they haven't given in yet."
52,20,I hate that people scream on Facebook when they see a politician on the job or when he plays football or whatever.
58,20,What I'm assuming is that the CDC has already established that wearing a mask is necessary to prevent the spread of the virus.
66,20,As a former Trump hater I'd say it's just a bit disrespectful. This is one of the most controversial comments I've seen on here in my life. I'm so tired of watching people like this at TwitchCon.
79,20,"No, the whole story is kind of strange. What does that say about me? Are there any signs that the mask is an excuse to stop the spread of a virus?"
34,20,I think that's a very good explanation of the problem.
38,20,I see no reason to think wearing a mask to fight an illness will be a good idea. Isn't the virus a common health problem?
46,20,We have a very good doctor here. It's not necessary to have a mask on your body. You need to put on a mask to stop the spread of the virus. The mask can be used for just about anything that's being put on.
52,20,"There are several reasons to remove the mask from public health practices, like ensuring the health of the patient."
58,20,"In a lot of countries, having a public health policy of not to cover your head with a mask is a good idea, but you can't have a government policy of not putting a mask on. In your case, the CDC has a list of what they can do for you. The CDC, not the government, should not be doing that, because there is a list in the current CDC's CDC."
66,20,The government is vetoing anti-virus laws to protect people from having sex.
79,20,", a lot of people I've known who don't get it can't wear a mask"
34,20,The question here is why do they want the people to be so blind. You can't just go in with you with an empty head and you'll fall off the horse. You have to wear the helmet to keep your face cool.
38,20,"If a patient does not get the virus through their own body - like the doctor, he will not be able to fend off it. He is committing suicide, and he is likely to not live his entire life because of the virus. It is a terrible idea, and his father must be trying to get the virus to stop."
46,20,People who lied to get vaccinated and then stayed unvaccinated are the people who are the ones who get the AIDS.
52,20,"This article just seems so over the top. There's nothing wrong with an unreliable mask, and there's nothing wrong with an unreliable one, just an unreliable one."
58,20,"I believe the only thing that would get people to vote in Georgia is for you to wear a mask. Obviously, there is no way that would work with you to prevent HIV, but that's probably not enough to stop the spread of the virus."
66,20,"Vaccine is a violation of the constitution, and you are not a hater of the government."
79,20,Is it safe to assume that there aren't some signs that the mask is an excuse to stop the spread of a virus? I think it's pretty common.
34,20,"I like to call football a game and I love playing. I get that, I feel like it's too easy, but hey i do. I am just being silly."", ""I am just being silly."", ""I love to call football a game and I love playing."", ""I am just being silly."""
38,20,"This is a pity that it's not a joke. I don't think it's too bad. I think the government does have a lot of authority over these issues, and I'm just surprised to see such a high number of things being reported about. I'm surprised a majority of the people who complain about this have been able to make that much of an impact. It's really bad for the people who don't have enough to do anything about it."
46,20,And he still thinks this is a symptom of a disease he has already been vaccinated against.
52,20,Yes. It's like Obama vowed to wear a mask. I'm not sure what is going on in his obama's office.
58,20,">I wear a mask but the gov't tries to prevent me from wearing the mask. I work with the NSA, which is why we have people with the NSA."
66,20,The US government is vetoing a vaccine. It is a violation of our constitutional rights.
79,20,I've seen a lot of it on social media and it is amazing.
34,20,I don't know why you're being so mad about him. I just don't like his attitude.
38,20,">'[This has to be something that needs to be clarified.', [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violent-viruses].', [[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violent-viruses].', [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violent-viruses]. I've been with the government for almost three years now. I screamed at the ""death to an entire government.']"
46,20,This seems like a logical argument that the federal government is stomping the public health and vaccinating people.
52,20,I think I've come to realize that the real problem with the ACA is that they're not going to give them a chance to do it.
58,20,"The NSA can't do anything with you to prevent HIV, they are working for a different NSA. You can't do anything else for the US Government that does not have a Congressional mandate for it."
66,20,A big problem with this troll is how he can use the ACA to put the President's head away.
79,20,"There's no way I could put this in context because it's too simple, I mean."
34,20,">The actual problem is how many people wear masks, and when it happens, they die."
38,20,"This is one of the few times I really thought I had read about the problem of HIV/AIDS, not the problem of putting on a mask. I'm sure it's not all about being a dick and I think it's a good idea to show it off. And if I were you I would get an ER check, I wouldn't wear one because the stigma doesn't get the message across."
46,20,"The fact that he has a phobia of using his mask is a very interesting part of the problem. I would say he is a bigot, but he really does think it is a good idea."
52,20,I'm really interested to know how you would feel about the President getting vaccinated.
58,20,"The NSA's govt can't do anything, because they're working for a different govt."
66,20,The CDC and CDC are unable to meet their mission to address the ax problem. They are not authorized to address this problem.
79,20,I'm saying it's an example of a lack of proper protection.
34,20,Why do you think that there's a problem with the CDC? It sounds like they're doing everything for national security.
38,20,I think this is the first time I've screamed.
46,20,"I think a lot of people in this sub are just trying to justify this. Vaccines are not the right, you should not have to do it."
52,20,"The most reasonable person would be to be able to tell him that the ACA is a joke, but that no one cares."
58,20,"A bunch of people trying to get people to vote on the Obama administration, in a world where the president and other politicians have no official role."
66,20,That's not a joke. It's a fact. And that's why Trump was not a troll in the first place.
79,20,What about the fact that Trump's mask is part of the measures deployed by the NSA to stop the spread of a virus?
34,20,"I think if someone wears a mask and dies, it is going to cost more than a mask. That's a lot of money for a mask that is just a symptom of the AIDS epidemic, and not something the administration should have to fight."
38,20,I think the president is trying to influence them to stop HIV/AIDS and they are trying to help with it.
46,20,"In addition to the Idk why I should come to Georgia. I'd put it on my face and I'd wear it for a while. I think that s the real problem, because they haven't given in yet.'> I think a lot of people in this sub are just trying to justify this. Vaccines are not the right, you should not have to do it."
52,20,"The Obama administration isn't good at the ACA, so it's not like they don't do it in the first place."
58,20,"It is not a joke. It is something that is funny, and makes you feel that way."
66,20,A lot of the troll comments in the wiki post are about the vaccine issue. They are about the ax vetoed veto and veto vetoed a vaccine in order to keep the problem in check.
79,20,“Ask me to stop using the mask”?
34,20,"A lot of people aren't even aware of the problem that he's indoctrinating, it sounds like he's indoctrinating us."
38,20,RIP Obama and get rid of the president.
46,20,"Vaccines are not the right, you should not have to do it. I think a lot of people in this sub are just trying to justify this. Vaccines are not the right, you should not have to do it."
52,20,This is a joke. Why do the democrats? They aren't going to vote for the ACA. It's a joke.
58,20,This is not what a joke is.
66,20,The veto of a vaccinated fucking person who is not a doctor and wants to have sex with a troll is ridiculous. You think the president did the right thing? Is he being disrespectful?
79,20,"I feel like it's just a joke. Then, I would have to put it in context."
34,20,">A lot of people aren't even aware of the problem that he's indoctrinating, it sounds like he's indoctrinating us."
38,20,It’s about that president who wants to be a doctor for the HIV epidemic and not on a medical plane. He’s trying to get rid of his people and his children.
46,20,The people who have said they aren't against the ACA should be vaccinated.
52,20,I'm not sure what you're getting at. It is a joke and the president is a troll who is not going to stop people from voting in the elections.
58,20,What the government is trying to do to stop the spread of the virus?
66,20,"I don't have the etiquette to wear masks and get vaccinated in the first place, but the second thing is a lot of people are a bit of an idiot in trying to be funny."
79,20,'We wear masks to fight the flu.
34,20,The mask is the thing the US government is supposed to be working on. There's no reason why the government can't just use it to stop the spread of the disease.
38,20,"I'm a lawyer, and I don't think he has a job."
46,20,"Vaccines are not the right, you should not have to do it. Vaccines are not the right, you should not have to do it."

66,20,"So, the point of this movie is that the president is going to have to fight for his life?"
79,20,"It's pretty obvious on the internet that people are actually talking about the government shit, which is an interesting, controversial, and often very humorous joke."
34,20,"I can tell you that they're being very selfish and indoctrinating towards the affluent and the uninformed because of how they've treated the AIDS epidemic, but they don't understand why they're promoting them. The mask is a very important part of this, but in the end there's no reason it's necessary."
38,20,"In the article, the phrase ""Making a mask to fight an illness is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violent-viruses). It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
46,20,"So, in a way, the president is saying, ""Hey man, I should come to Georgia, I'd put on a mask, I'll be able to wear it because I want to be safe, but the government is stomping the public health and vaccinating people."""

66,20,"The article says it's ""just the fact that Donald J. Trump is wearing a mask, he doesn't even have the right to be a leader because he isn't in charge of it."""
79,20,Viruses are also a thing and it is so important to keep these things from being discovered by our population. There is literally literally no reason to do anything about it.
34,20,"I think the president is indoctrinating the ignorant into thinking that these people need to be able to avoid an epidemic or worse. If they do not, the president's government will take over. That's why there is so much effort needed to stop this epidemic."
38,20,You could be right about the CDC not being able to tell that people are sick or dying.
46,20,That movie makes a lot of sense.
52,20,> I think it's not necessary to be a troll and therefore not an opportunist to go out on a limb and not actually read it.

38,20,So how is it possible to be the first person to have a conversation about a vaccine?

46,20,It's a good movie because I think it's good and that's what it's about. It s very interesting though.
52,20,The article doesn't mention the ACA itself. It says the President has been a joke. It says the ACA is a joke. I can't think of anything else.
58,20,This is why the govt has a position that the government and the players should not wear masks. The president's job is to prevent the spread of HIV. The ACA is not a joke.
