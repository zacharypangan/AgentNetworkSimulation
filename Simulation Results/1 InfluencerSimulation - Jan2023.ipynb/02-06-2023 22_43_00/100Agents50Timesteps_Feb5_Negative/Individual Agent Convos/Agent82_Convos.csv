93,82,"CANNOTANSWER, i m not against vacks mandates cuz they ruin the economy get people fired and people should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force"
82,2,CANNOTANSWER is describing a piece of information from the ACA that has been made public by the state. You could ask him to explain how the mask works.
82,11,I don't really get why people want to know about the ACA.
82,21,The only reason that it's being downvoted is because the government wants to reduce the burden on the government. I'm not sure why it's being downvoted.
82,25,"The ACA doesn't apply in Australia as of yet, as the government wants people to live in countries where the AIDS epidemic has spread."
82,27,Why is wearing a mask illegal?
82,32,"Having a mask doesn’t stop the spread of any virus. It is to stop a virus. You can do what you want without a mask, but you need a shield from the danger of getting infected."
82,35,"In Australia, the only other federal government mandate would be to make it a federal mandate to ensure the public that they are wearing a mask isn't infected. That is not a valid reason to be against it. I'm sure the state would also appoint a tyrant to stop any ties to that state."
82,36,That's the guy I was going to talk to. I'm not saying he's right or wrong but he's trying to make an anti-lifestyle aversion for Obamacare. I'm a huge fan of people who believe in the ACA. I'm the one who makes the video.

82,78,Is that an article that was published to support the Obamacare Act?
92,82,The article states that it isn't a good idea and that there isn't a proper system in place. So the only one is that that's a good idea.
93,82,"I'm not saying it is politically correct, but I'm just assuming that you can't believe the actual article states ACA is a political issue."
82,2,"The main problem isn't whether the government revokes or repeals the ACA. There's no law against the ACA, so I'd be less upset about the repeal than the anti-abortion party, as there's some big confusion about what is being fought in Congress."

82,21,"I don't think that the whole ""Ask a person to stop the spread of a virus"" thing really is the most important tidbit here. The article says that ""We are not against the prohibition on using the ACA"" and it's not in reference to the ACA, but it's a joke about the people who pushed for it."
82,25,"It was made public in Australia and the government did not want it to be passed, so they are not against it, but rather not against it."
82,27,>why is wearing a mask illegal?
82,32,"I just want to say that the ACA in Australia does not support the right to health care. I'm not saying it is politically correct, but I'm just assuming that you can't believe the actual article states it is a good idea."
