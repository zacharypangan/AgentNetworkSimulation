93,92,"""The people who pushed for the ACA are actually opposed to it?"""
93,1,Yes. I'm completely correct.
93,2,"Yes, the article is titled ""We are all against vacks mandates, and this is one example of a government being opportunistic."""
93,5,"I can't remember what you meant when you said ""I'm against vacks mandates cuz they ruin the economy get people fired and people should be able to choose to wear a mask or getting the jab if they want not by force."
93,10,"""We're talking about a bunch of different ACA laws enacted by the US Congress."""
93,12,"In other words, the president wants to get rid of the ACA. So he's a dictator."
93,16,[The government is imposing mandatory health care laws on all citizens and its employees.](http://www.cos.gov/reports/political/healthcare/index.aspx?id=3876)
93,23,"CANNOTANSWER, if that is the case."
93,24,You're making the wrong assumption?
93,26,>We are all against vacks mandates and this is one example of a government being opportunistic?''
93,32,CANNOTANSWER: The president is an opportunistic dictator. The president is an opportunistic dictator.
93,33,The president is an opportunistic dictator. You are making the wrong assumption. It doesn't make you a tyrant. He wants to change the health care system.
93,36,The article states that he is against these policies because it makes a problem of the government's policies. The idea that they are opportunistic is not relevant in this context.
93,44,"We are not against vacks mandates because we are not in favor of the ACA, but because the government does not want to do anything that is supposed to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS."
93,48,I'm actually not a political analyst.
93,56,The thing that's interesting is the article that a guy with a mask gets a jab and gets a jab. This is pretty much what I thought.
93,62,I know I'm not a tyrant. But the thing about Vacks mandates is that you can't get your face stabbed with a pen and just try to take it off. They also make you uncomfortable because of a few things that don't matter at the moment. If you put it on for example it will make you uncomfortable.
93,64,"I think the article states that he is against these policies because it makes a problem of the government's policies. I think the article states that they're ""too opportunistic to pass anything without the consent of a doctor."""
93,66,"I think this is a bit premature, but it is also true that most people are not going to be able to go through a depressed period and/or crisis due to the healthcare crisis and lack of a doctor, and are not going to survive long enough to make a big change."
93,67,"I would like to point out that the people in the video here have stated they are against the ACA as the ""main issue"" which is causing many people to suffer AIDS, not just the ACA, so they are against it."
93,70,"""We are all against vacks mandates and this is one example of a government being opportunistic"""
93,81,"Well, the article states that he is against these policies because it makes a problem of the government's policies."
93,82,"I can't speak for everyone, but this guy is a big ass tyrant who wants to be on the right side of things. Its just a tidbit, and I think the point is that people can say things like, ""Well, we're 'those'people who want ACA. But this isn't an option, that's a problem."""
93,90,Why did you write the article? It's not that easy to come up with an actual answer.
93,92,"The guy is not an idiot, the whole article is about him trying to change the health care system. The president is a tyrant, the article is about the government wanting to change the health care system."
93,1,>We are not against vacks mandates because we are not in favor of the ACA.
93,2,I think the President is an opportunistic dictator.
93,5,I think you are very right. I want to point out that I don't believe the president is the tyrant.
93,10,"They can't do anything without the consent of a doctor, as a government-funded narcotics trade scheme. The govt is also not going to go ahead and force someone to pay someone to take a shot."
93,12,"They didn't say this was a tidbit, they said that you can go through a depressed period and/or crisis due to the healthcare crisis and lack of a doctor, and are not going to survive long enough to make a big change. They said that a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
93,16,Isn't the government really opportunistic to pass a bill that actually averts the spread of a virus.
93,23,"OP, we have to understand what the ACA is for, not the president."
93,24,"CANNOTANSWER, if that is the case. You're making the wrong assumption. I can't speak for everyone, but this guy is a big ass tyrant who wants to be on the right side of things. Why did you write the article? It's not that easy to come up with an actual answer. The guy is not an idiot, the whole article is about him trying to change the health care system."
93,26,The whole thing is a tidbit.
93,32,What would you say to the article?
93,33,if you like to have a nice sex life then you should consider becoming a public defender of the ACA.
93,36,>We are not against vacks mandates because it makes a problem of the government's policies. The article states that he is against these policies because it makes a problem of the government's policies. The idea that they are opportunistic is not relevant in this context.
93,44,"The ACA is not a permanent solution, it is an end of the war for health care. In this context it doesn't matter if the health care system is being destroyed or not. It's a symptom of the general devastation that is coming from a lack of a healthcare system."
93,48,"I think what you are describing is a great example of a political tyrant, a person who wants a change of the healthcare system."
93,56,"It's a fact that you can't buy health insurance. The people in the video here have stated that they are against the ACA, not just the ACA. They are not making money off of it and they're not doing their jobs in the face of an AIDS epidemic and they're not a threat to health care."
93,62,"I think the article states that he is against these mandates because they're ""too opportunistic to pass anything without the consent of a doctor."""
93,64,This is a tidbit of facts. I'm not really sure if you're a tyrant or not.
93,66,You could argue that most people don't have access to healthcare because it's not the main issue affecting them.
93,67,"No! I think it's a bit premature because the article states that the president is an opportunistic dictator. But, he's not actually a tyrant who wants to get rid of anything because he can't do anything that is supposed to stop the spread of AIDS."
93,70,They are not supposed to save lives.
93,81,I think the actual question you ask is: Are you arguing that the President is an opportunistic dictator?
93,82,The article also claims that it was made a little premature. What a tyrant. It is so misleading and a tyrant. The government is not a dictator and is a tyrant.
93,90,I am in favor of the Affordable Care Act. The Obama Administration is pushing ACA. But the President is trying to change the system.
93,92,"We are against them. Its not just the government, but also the healthcare system itself."
93,1,"I was never in favor of the ACA, but I was arguing that you are completely right."
93,2,"""Do you think that the people who's on the run is doing a lot of good, because they want people to be more free to choose and spend their money than they are without a mask?"""
93,5,I think your point is right because if you don't believe in the ACA the ACA is a terrible idea.
93,10,Is the ACA only a temporary solution to the issues of the US economy? No.
93,12,What a tyrant. I think the whole article is about him trying to change the healthcare system.
93,16,"CANNOTANSWER, if that is the case."
93,23,A very serious question. Is the article saying that the President of the United States is a tyrant who wants to get rid of any form of health care?
93,24,I'm afraid we're talking about the ACA.
93,26,>We are not against vacks mandates because it makes a problem of the government's policies.
93,32,"I'm not the one who wrote the article, I'm the one who writes it. It's very hard to make a real argument on this one."
93,33,"I think the article states that he is against these mandates because they're ""too opportunistic to pass anything without the consent of a doctor."""
93,36,This is what they say as part of a policy discussion: 'How do you know that you've never heard of the ACA?'
93,44,I'm not sure I have a clue what I am going to say in this video. I don't want to believe it.
93,48,This is a huge topic that everyone knows is a huge topic. And that's why I posted it. I'm not sure what the topic is but I think it's a good article and I'm trying to think that people should know better.
93,56,Isn't it a big question that the people who wrote the article are not arguing that the president is a tyrant who wants to change the healthcare system?
93,62,"The article focuses on the ""Opportunists on the Run"" and they have their own version of ""Wooding a Mask"". They argue that there should be legislation that makes it so that people would be able to choose to wear a mask if they were able to. It's not a joke. The ""Opportunists on the Run"" has nothing to do with a ""Tyrant,"" they don't have a single question."
93,64,"The US has a terrible economy with a very expensive medical system. The US has an epidemic of AIDS. It has no cure, no cure. It has no cure. It's not like the economy is just not working, not that it's helping the American people. It's not the people that are responsible for it."
93,66,The only problem you are experiencing is the devaluation of the ACA.
93,67,"The government is not just a tyrant, but a political tyrant."
93,70,"This is so interesting, I would like to say that the president is a tyrant who wants to get rid of any form of health care."
93,81,What about thugs who are able to yank a piece of paper from the bush administration to the president?
93,82,The article states that the guy is an opportunistic dictator because it's a problem with the government's policies.
93,90,"What's the difference? I think you are just making up stories that make the most sense, a little too simplistic for your liking."
93,92,There's a lot of confusion here if it's a discussion about the fact that the Obama Administration is pushing the ACA.
93,1,The only thing I really do is vote for someone who wants to work.
93,2,"I have been on the run for a year, and I've never heard of this. What a good excuse."
93,5,"I was just referencing the fact that the article is about the president trying to get rid of the ACA and the ACA is an important part of that campaign. It would be a great way to show a different perspective, while trying to show the people of the US that they think the ACA is a bad idea."
93,10,"I don't know, I can't believe that the guy who wrote this article hasn't even been out for a few months."
93,12,"You are right about that, and I would also point out that the people who wrote the article are right about how important it is to get rid of the ACA. It sounds like it has a lot of ambiguity on it, so this might not be the best place to look."
93,16,">We are not against vacks mandates because it makes a problem of the government's policies. I'm not the one who wrote the article, I'm the one who writes it."
93,23,The article states that the guy is an opportunistic dictator because it's a problem with the government's policies.
93,24,"If you want to know the people's reaction to the ACA, you have to read the entire article in order to understand what's going on. There's a lot of confusion here, a little too simplistic for your liking."
93,26,"A lot of people are against the ACA, and I don't think people who do know anything about it are getting a lot of respect for it."
93,32,"No I haven't read the whole article, I haven't heard a single example that has even come close to the title."
93,33,"Trying to give the impression that the ACA is in the hands of ""thugs"" is a bad idea."
93,36,This is the kind of stuff the e-bay guy with a big head thinks would be a good idea. But it's not.
93,44,There's no single example of a single article devoted solely to the issue of Obamacare. It's not a political opinion piece.
93,48,"""You are an opportunist, but we are all a tyrant, because we are a very good person. The president is a tyrant, because of his political views."""
93,56,It was actually just the other article addressing the ACA.
93,62,What about Vacks mandates?'
93,64,The ACA is going to be a very expensive medical system. There is no cure for the AIDS epidemic.
93,66,CANNOTANSWER: I'm not against vacks mandates cuz I don't think i'll catch the cough i already had it i'm against them cuz they ruin the economy get people fired and people should be able to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force.'
93,67,"The Obama administration was trying to stop the spread of AIDS, so the US resisted changing the healthcare system."
93,70,I don't know. The whole thing seems like an arbitrary piece of paper and I'm not sure how many people are in the crowd.
93,81,The President is not an opportunistic dictator. He's a political tyrant.
93,82,"""How do you know that you've never heard of the ACA?"""
93,90,"The article is going to make the public think about the Obama administration. It is going to be in the top 2 or 3 of the comments where the comments are made, implying that this isn't true."
93,92,Those are all examples of what a government is opportunistic to pass without the permission of a doctor.
93,1,CANNOTANSWER:
93,2,"The ACA was trying to stop the spread of AIDS, so the US resisted changing the healthcare system."
93,5,The point is that the ACA is not a bad idea. Those are examples of what a government is opportunistic to pass without the permission of a doctor.
93,10,The Obamacare Act was enacted by the US Congress in 2000 and only was passed by Congress in 2000. The new Obamacare Act was passed in 2000 by the govt.
93,12,I don't think people are willing to accept what Obama is pushing for and why.
93,16,The ACA is not a political issue. The article states that the president is an opportunistic dictator. He is a tyrant.
93,23,"Considering the article's title, I don't think that I could have scribbled in a paragraph like the one in the article about the President's political views."
93,24,"The Obama administration was trying to stop the spread of AIDS, so the US resisted changing the healthcare system. I don't think there's any point in trying to talk the entire thing, as someone who's never heard of the ACA, can probably understand why the US is so vehemently opposed to its repeal and its implementation."
93,26,This is actually an attempt to break into a more specific group of people. They are basically the same party that opposed the repeal of the ACA (they are just being an asshole) but now they are entrusted with a job in the healthcare industry that is not a public office. The ACA would not make the government an opportunistic dictator because it would not be an effective alternative.
93,32,"CANNOTANSWER: I'm not against the ACA. I'm not sure if anyone here is aware of this, but this is a serious issue for someone who doesn't read the government."
93,33,"""The President is an opportunistic dictator. You are making the wrong assumption. It doesn't make you a tyrant. He wants to change the health care system."""
93,36,I think it's also an interesting fact that some people aren't aware of the ACA. The whole ACA thing is a bit confusing.
93,44,A few things from my background are important to me.
93,48,Is there any other type of medical law that you can take advantage of?
93,56,CANNOTANSWER: I'm not against vacks mandates cuz I don't think i'll catch the cough i already had it i'm against them cuz they ruin the economy get people fired and people should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force
93,62,I'm not a big fan of the ACA either but the ACA is one of my most cited arguments so far.
93,64,"What I like to hear here is that the Obama administration did not pass the ACA without the consent of a doctor, the people who pushed for it and the President who did not have the consent of a doctor were the ones that passed the ACA."
93,66,"I'm going to go with ""I'm not against vacks mandates cuz I don't think i'll catch the cough i already had it i'm against them cuz they ruin the economy get people fired and people should be able to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to wear a mask or get the jab"
93,67,"The Obama administration is a tyrant, but it's not true. The ACA is going to be a very expensive medical system. There is no cure for the AIDS epidemic."
93,70,"In addition to this one, the article is trying to get people to think about the Obama administration."
93,81,"Why is the US taking a vote against this? If you are not the one who wrote the article, you are not the one who writes the article."
93,82,"I am sorry, I do not understand your point, but you say something about Obamacare that I disagree with, that he is a tyrant. He is an asshole and a tyrant. What is he talking about?"
93,90,"It's called ""Phoebes Syndrome""."
93,92,The article that started it seems to indicate that Obama has been acting in a way that is the right one.
93,1,The article is claiming that the ACA is an attempt to break into a more specific group of people. The article claims that the ACA is not a political issue. The article states that the president is an opportunistic dictator. He is a tyrant.
93,2,CANNOTANSWER:
93,5,CANNOTANSWER: The president is an opportunistic dictator. The president is an opportunistic dictator.
93,10,It's a terrible thing. I'm sorry.
93,12,Obamacare doesn't require consent. They're going to require people to be forced to get a doctor.
93,16,I don't understand why so many people don't understand what the ACA is.
93,23,"CANNOTANSWER, but I am not familiar with the title"
93,24,"CANNOTANSWER: I'm not against the ACA. I'm not sure if anyone here is aware of this, but this is actually an attempt to break into a more specific group of people."
93,26,"I'm not against the ACA or the ACA, but you're right."
93,32,"CANNOTANSWER: I'm not against the ACA. I'm not sure if anyone here is aware of this, but this is a serious issue for someone who doesn't read the government."
93,33,There are people in this subreddit who disagree with you.
93,36,"I think that the Obama administration is a tyrant, but it's not true."
93,44,"""We are not against vacks mandates because we are not in favor of the ACA, but because the government does not want to do anything that is supposed to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS."""
93,48,The article that started it seems to indicate that Obama has been acting in a way that is the right one.
93,56,"IANAL, but I'dn't think it's right that the article states the president is an opportunistic dictator vs. an opportunistic dictator because the administration was trying to stop the spread of AIDS vs. the government."
93,62,They’re trying to be a little more opportunistic than you think.
93,64,CANNOTANSWER:
93,66,"The president is a tyrant. I don't think the government has anything wrong with that, it isn't like the president is actually helping it because of the way the government works. I think he's doing a tyrant thing."
93,67,"The ACA is an attempt to break into a more specific group of people. 'The President is an opportunistic dictator. But, he's not actually a tyrant who wants to get rid of anything because he can't do anything that is supposed to stop the spread of AIDS.''"
93,70,The fact that the Obama administration is a tyrant is just the one explanation I can't think of that makes it untrue.
93,81,The ACA is one of the few things that is not related to the ACA. The ACA is a system that we are using to try to fix.
93,82,"It's not a ""phoebes syndrome"". It's a ""phoebes syndrome"". It is a kind of a political issue."
93,90,"This article is a little eerily familiar, mainly because I had no idea it was a thing at first."
93,92,"There is a lot of confusion here if it's a discussion about the fact that the Obama administration is pushing the ACA without the consent of a doctor, the people who pushed for it and the President who did not have the consent of a doctor. The whole article is about the government wanting to change the health care system."
93,1,he's a tyrant but i think the ACA is what is really wrong and not a tyrant. the ACA prevents AIDS and I don't think you get the sense.
93,2,The ACA is a system that the US is using to try to fix.
93,5,"i'm not a doctor, but i have had to put on my mask, and even though i had a shit ton of doctors who made this a legitimate thing to do before the president passed it, i do still have a shit ton of doctors who are trying to get them to change the health care system to prevent people from getting sick and dying because the president did not have enough doctors to cure them."
93,10,"They're not working, because the government doesn't do anything to stop a virus."
93,12,"The article, the quote: ""I think we need to go back to the basic point: What about the people who pushed for the ACA?"
93,16,"I don't understand why people don't understand what the ACA is. The fact that the Obama administration is pushing the ACA without the consent of a doctor, the people who pushed for it and the President who did not have the consent of a doctor."
93,23,This is what the article is about. '.
93,24,I'm not sure if anyone here understands what the article is about or how the article is describing the Obama administration but it's not true.
93,26,"I read this article as: ""You seem to know a good amount about the government and not the entire issue."""
93,32,"In an ACA article: ""The president is an opportunistic dictator. I don't think the government has anything wrong with that."
93,33,"I think Obama is the right president. He hasn't done anything to make it all work. And while he is a tyrant, I think the way he acts is quite an interesting one."
93,36,Why does not the ACA require consent? Because it's illegal to make your own health insurance policies?
93,44,I think I read the same thing here:
93,48,I am sure there are a lot of people out there who are sick of this.
93,56,This is pretty much the biggest problem in my country.
93,62,>I'm not against the ACA. I'm not sure if anyone here is aware of this.
93,64,It is actually a really big issue that the government needs to be fighting for.
93,66,"I'm not against the ACA, but I'm against the ACA as a major threat to the people."
93,67,"They are saying something like: ""I think people have a problem with the government but they also have a problem with the government."""
93,70,"I am not sure whether to support the repeal of health care or not, but to say that you believe the president is an opportunistic dictator is the wrong stance."
93,81,The article is about the Obama administration wanting to change the health care system.
93,82,"People say what they think they see as a tyrant, while stating that they are not against Obamacare and that they are against HIV."
93,90,"You're a naive man, but in my opinion the president has been a tyrant. They're trying to make people think they have a problem with the government. They have to get rid of everything."
93,92,"The point of the article is to bring the issue of the President and its agenda into line with the agenda of the administration - which in my opinion, has no place in the policy of the Obama administration."
93,1,"This is a bad article, I'm just reading it as ""I think that the Obama administration has been a tyrant. They're trying to make people think they have a problem with the government. They have to get rid of everything."""
93,2,Obamacare is one of the things he doesn't agree with.
93,5,>I'm not against the ACA. I'm not sure if anyone here is aware of this.
93,10,... but the US government doesn't make any kind of health care.
93,12,A tyrant is a tyrant? He is an opportunistic dictator.
93,16,I think the article is being used to put the issue into line with the agenda of the administration.
93,23,The post title is in English.
93,24,"There is a huge number of people trying to get the President to do the right thing and the ACA is just being made up for that. They say something like ""I'm not against the ACA,"" but that's only the first sentence."
93,26,"There is a lot of misunderstanding about the question ""What is the difference between the two?"" and ""What are the two terms that would have a difference? What's the difference between ""I think people have a problem with the government but they also have a problem with the government."""
93,32,"I think the point of the article is to bring the issue of the president and its agenda into line with the agenda of the Obama administration - which in my opinion, has no place in the policy of the Obama administration."
93,33,I don't think the government is trying to make people think they have a problem with the government. It's trying to make people think they have a problem with the government.
93,36,">I think the article is about the president and its agenda - which in my opinion, has no place in the policy of the Obama administration."
93,44,"There are several articles about a ""tyrant"" president that are all about the ACA."
93,48,a lot of people who want to fight a trumped up war on AIDS?
93,56,"A naive man could be a tyrant, but he doesn't have to have a lot of money to support the ACA or change it."
93,62,"I have heard of this, I think it's pretty good advice."
93,64,"No, I'm not an 'opportunistic dictator'. This article has nothing to do with the president."
93,66,"I think Obama is doing a tyrant thing, but the fact that it is being used by the people as an excuse to go to war is incredibly concerning."
93,67,I think a few of the comments that are mentioned in the article are misleading. They have nothing to do with the ACA.
93,70,I think the article is saying that the Obamacare Act is a big deal but not as big as this one.
93,81,"This is not what the government wants, it is what the people want."
93,82,"It's a bit hysterical a lot of times, but I don't think I understand the actual context. The article isn't about the actual president, it's about the issue that he pushed the issue over. I think it's about the fact that the article is describing Obama's policies. It's not a political issue."
93,90,"""I think people have a problem with the government but they also have a problem with the government."""
93,92,I'm sure you know that the wording in this article is very true.
93,1,The article claims the ACA is a way to change a certain group of people into something different.
93,2,I'm not even sure what that is.
93,5,The word 'tyrant' is used to describe a system of government that makes the most money. And this is a very good example of a tyrant's opportunism.
93,10,That's about the only thing the article was about.
93,12,"This doesn't even sound like a good idea. If it's like this, and I can't even read it, I'll continue to take a look at it."
93,16,I'm saying it's an article. I was surprised when the article came out that a bunch of people on the left of the ACA were saying they wanted the government to do something about it. It's the first time I've heard of someone on the left of the ACA who was saying they wanted the government to do something about it. I didn't get it.
93,23,"I'm not an opportunist, but the fact that I think this article is being used as an excuse to go to war is concerning."
93,24,">(The article is about the President. I think the article is about the president and its agenda - which in my opinion, has no place in the policy of the Obama administration."
93,26,I'm not sure I've read the article. I don't know how the quote is going to end up affecting the article. I just read it in the newspaper.
93,32,CANNOTANSWER has a great idea for the title to be 'I think people have a problem with the government but they also have a problem with the government'.
93,33,">The article isn't about the actual president, it's about the fact that the article is describing Obama's policies. It's not a political issue."
93,36,If we're not talking about the ACA at all we are talking about a few people claiming to be presidents.
93,44,It's the President's responsibility to help people because his policies do not change. I think I'm going to go back and read the entire article that was written about it.
93,48,"I think that the ACA doesn't deserve to be put in place, so there's that."
93,56,"I’m the one who really hates the Obamacare repeal plan. It would help stop people from starting new HIV and not get sick or being able to buy health care. That being said, there’s no point in spending money on the government unless it is not on the agenda of the ACA."
93,62,What do you think about a guy who stabbed a person with a pen?
93,64,"Is there an article somewhere saying ""Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.""?"
93,66,This is a pathetic piece of shit.
93,67,"""[i have never heard of 'The ACA is actually preventing AIDS because of the ACA.' But this is something I really, really enjoy doing with my time with my parents."""
93,70,Is there any chance that this is the context of something that has already been discussed on here?
93,81,"I'm not trying to argue the ACA is a tyrant, but I do not agree with it."
93,82,[Waiting a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.A tyrant is a tyrant? He is an opportunistic dictator.
93,90,The Obama administration isn't going to change the health care system. They need to do so without fear of the public getting manipulated.
93,92,You just described an issue that I think the article is about:
93,1,The article is about a couple of things that I like:
93,2,">(The article isn't about the actual president, it's about the fact that the article is describing Obama's policies. It's not a political issue."
93,5,I really hate this quote. I was trying to come up with a good way to explain it. I have no idea what it is about. Obviously I'm a moderate. I like your way of saying the 'comments' part. 'You're going to go to war' seems ridiculous to me. This is going to show a different perspective.
93,10,'Potentially not working' is a misleading title. A political issue isn't a political issue.
93,12,"The article isn't about the actual president, it's about the fact that the article is describing Obama's policies."
93,16,"Why don't people use the president's agenda as an excuse to go to war? I'm not a fan of the Bush era, but I do think the Obama administration has done a great job preventing the spread of AIDS, which is unfortunate because they used it as an excuse to go to war."
93,23,"The article is misleading, a lot of it 'explains' what the article is about. It's a lot of shit."
93,24,">Its a lot of confusion here, a little too simplistic for your liking."
93,26,It's an idiocy that should be thrown around.
93,32,"I'm not sure about the ""the idea of doing things"", but I think ""The Obamacare repeal plan is really the best I've ever read about."" I would be very interested to know."
93,33,"""I think the president is an opportunistic dictator. You are making the wrong assumption. It doesn't make you a tyrant. He wants to change the health care system."""
93,36,I think there is a lot of misinformation out there that may cause confusion. I don't think that's anything to be worried about.
93,44,CANNOTANSWER says the Obamacare repeal plan isn't an issue of government intervention. If you're not on the left of the ACA you might as well be in favor of it.
93,48,"I hate to admit it, but it is in the title."
93,56,The article isn't just about the ACA.
93,62,Why isn’t there an article somewhere saying “Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus”?
93,64,I just want to say that I think the Obama administration is trying to bring awareness to that issue as something that everyone knows is a huge conspiracy theory - I think it's time to put an end to this nonsense.
93,66,"... and I will tell you what I don't like, and I don't like what the article says."
93,67,"""The ACA is not a political issue. I think the article is about the president and its agenda - which in my opinion, has no place in the policy of the Obama administration."
93,70,People who don't understand that Obamacare is a tyrant are generally more concerned about the federal government than the actual health care system.
93,81,'It's time to get back to the original point of a government'
93,82,"I really, really enjoy my time with my parents. I think I can't get through this."
93,90,Why does Obama need to stop preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS?
93,92,The article is about the president wanting to change the health care system. This is about the people who want to suffocate.
93,1,It's a lot easier to find a link in r/AIDS/SupportFacts for this article to get it back to the original title than to read a full article and see what the entire thing is about.
93,2,">“Do you think that the people who's on the run is doing a lot of good, because they want people to be more free to choose and spend their money than they are without a mask.”"
93,5,"I have a n-word for the word ""comment"" and the n-word is for the n-word. That sounds very silly."
93,10,Why is 'Potentially not working' a misleading title? A political issue isn't a political issue.
93,12,"[In other words, the president wants to get rid of the ACA. So he's a dictator."
93,16,"Why are the ""I'm not against vacks mandates cuz i don't think i ll catch the cough i already had it i m against them cuz they ruin the economy get people fired and people should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force"" words?"
93,23,"CANNOTANSWER: The article is misleading, a lot of it 'explains' what the article is about."
93,24,">If you want to know what the ""masked person"" would be like in your life? The one with the mask?',"
93,26,They said the article's topic was about the fact that Obamacare is an opportunistic state.
93,32,"> I think the Obamacare repeal plan is really the best I've ever read about."""
93,33,There are a few things that you have to know about the president:
93,36,"That's not really the issue, it's the people's problem. This is all based on the same basic idea of an illogical conspiracy. It's called the 'Why don't people use the president's agenda as an excuse to go to war?'"
93,44,The Obamacare repeal plan isn't an issue of government intervention. It is an issue of government intervention.
93,48,I think you need to read the entire article.
93,56,"That is not a problem, but one I see a lot of people have. The article says ""I think the president is an opportunistic dictator. You are making the wrong assumption. It doesn't make you a tyrant. He wants to change the healthcare system."""
93,62,You are right to be surprised by how often it comes up here about the president.
93,64,"""The ACA is a tyrant, but I can't get through this."""
93,66,"This is all good. You're all right to be skeptical, but do you even read the whole thing? The guy who got the job is one of the dumbest people in the country."
93,67,"''The president is an opportunistic dictator. But, he's not actually a tyrant who wants to get rid of anything because he can't do anything that is supposed to stop the spread of AIDS.'''"
93,70,It's kind of a conspiracy theory.
93,81,There's a lot of confusion here.
93,82,... and I will tell you what I don't like.
93,90,CANNOTANSWER is not an idiot for defending the ACA. There is a lot of hate that exists between people on both sides of the issue.
93,92,"""Its a lot of confusion here, a little too simplistic for your liking. I think the Obama administration is trying to bring awareness to that issue as something that everyone knows is a huge conspiracy theory - I think it's time to put an end to this nonsense."
93,1,"This is not a good article, and not an easy one to understand."
93,2,The ACA was a great example of what the US is trying to do. It is not an issue of government intervention. It is an issue of government intervention.
93,5,I'm not sure what you mean.
93,10,Is the US government actually doing anything to stop the spread of a virus?
93,12,This is a huge conspiracy.
93,16,"It says that ""he is an opportunistic dictator."
93,23,It's a conspiracy theory that the people of the ACA are not against it. This isn't a true story. It's a good hive mind.
93,24,"I just read the article. That is all good. You're all right to be skeptical, but do you even read the whole thing? The guy who got the job is one of the dumbest people in the country."
93,26,It's actually a tidbit. I think it's interesting to read the quote and see what happens when the article's title makes a dent in your understanding.
93,32,This is all based on the same basic idea of an illogical conspiracy.
93,33,"That's really all good. You're all right to be skeptical, but do you even read the entire article? The guy who got the job is one of the dumbest people in the country. ''The president is an opportunistic dictator."
93,36,"In other words, the president wants to get rid of the ACA. So he's a dictator. Why are the ""I'm not against vacks mandates cuz i don't think i will catch the cough i already had it i want not by force"" words?"
93,44,"I'm not really sure if the ACA repeal plan was meant to stop AIDS, but I have heard several articles of people saying it was, in the past and have been on the back burner. They are in no way a political piece and they have been in a position to say something about it."
93,48,"I'm not saying it is wrong, I'm just saying I think that it's a very valid issue."
93,56,You are one of the dumbest people in the country. CANNOTANSWER is not an idiot for defending the ACA. There is a lot of confusion here.
93,62,''I'm not against the ACA.
93,64,This is not the kind of stuff I like to read.
93,66,"They have said a lot of things about Obama and that the administration needs to ""move the needle"" to a solution that reflects the current problems. And in fact, there's no question that the ACA is a tyrant. The ACA is just a tyrant, that's for sure."
93,67,"You're not wrong to be skeptical, but you are wrong."
93,70,I’ve seen the article a few times and I don’t understand why they were coming up with it. You are not an idiot for defending the ACA. There is a lot of confusion here.
93,81,It is a lot of confusion in this article.
93,82,Obamacare repeal is a piece of shit. It's just a tidbit.
93,90,I think this is an important discussion on this subject.
93,92,The guy is not an idiot for defending the ACA. There is a lot of hate that exists between people on both sides of the issue.
93,1,I'm just trying to be naive enough to say that this article is a tidbit.
93,2,The question is: What does the president want to stop?
93,5,You have no idea what the ACA is about? The whole point of the ACA is to stop AIDS?
93,10,It's a huge conspiracy that is going on among people on both sides of the debate:
93,12,> The guy who got the job is one of the dumbest people in the country.
93,16,"What's your point. The President is doing the ACA for the government. It was created because of his 'opportunism'. If he wanted to repeal it, they would have voted to repeal it."
93,23,"The government is also trying to get rid of health care. They say it’s part of the “Marias” to try to stop the spread of a virus. This is a conspiracy that the government has nothing to do with, and it’s based on the ACA. Getting rid of health care is the most dangerous thing in the world."
93,24,"I think that if you can't see the difference between what Obama was trying to accomplish and what Obama was trying to accomplish with it, you should read the article first. It's a great way to understand this and not the other way around."
93,26,">This is a huge conspiracy. It says that ""he is an opportunistic dictator. It's a conspiracy theory that the people of the ACA are not against it. This isn't a true story. It's a good hive mind. I just read the article. That is all good. You're all right to be skeptical, but do you even read the entire thing? The guy who got the job is one of the dumbest people in the country."
93,32,The ACA repeal plan is actually the best I've ever read about.
93,33,"Those aren't just common sense statements, but actually a naive premise for an ideologically wrong notion. If you look at this article in the context of the Bush Administration, there is a very large conspiracy. This article gives a little context as to why this would be an intelligent question but it's one that I'm pretty sure is very relevant to the discussion as well."
93,36,I can't stop thinking about the ACA being the bad guys.
93,44,The article is based on the same basic idea of an illogical conspiracy.
93,48,"I agree with the first comment that it's a huge conspiracy theory that the government is wrong, but they are wrong."
93,56,"The entire article says """"There is a lot of confusion here."
93,62,I read the whole article and I can tell you that this isn't yours.
93,64,I see why you want to read the headline.
93,66,That's a good point.
93,67,"> I'm not sure if the ACA was meant to stop the spread of AIDS, but I have heard several articles of people saying it was, in the past and have been on the back burner."
93,70,I think this is a pretty good article. I'm going to have to go read it again now to see if I'll be making a post again soon enough.
93,81,I think you should have read the title and read it.
93,82,"And when the article says that they are not anti- Obama, why does the article have anything to do with it?"
93,90,i don't think that would be useful to the people on both sides of the issue.
93,92,You're not an idiot for defending the ACA. There is a lot of confusion here.
93,1,I'm gonna write to him and say it's just a tidbit.
93,2,I think he needs to cut Obamacare down some. It's in the headline.
93,5,What are the facts of Obama's retaliation on the ACA? The government is going to do a lot of things to keep people from getting sick and dying because of the ACA.
93,10,"A conspiracy theory is an anti-government conspiracy theory, not a real one."
93,12,The whole issue is that there are some fundamental contradictions between the ACA and the Bush administration.
93,16,"The problem is the government has taken a long, long time to get rid of the ACA. It’s an example of a government being opportunistic. He’s an opportunistic dictator."
93,23,"A lot of things are being said, but the first paragraph doesn't make sense."
93,24,"> I haven't heard of the ACA, but I have heard several articles of people saying it was, in the past and have been on the back burner. I think this is a pretty good article."
93,26,"""We should stop doing what is right by the people in control of our politics""."
93,32,Why doesn't the Obama Administration put this information into the article? Why didn't they put it into the headline?
93,33,"...and it seems that the Obama Administration is using the ACA to squander millions of dollars from the federal budget that went into repealing it, as well as taking the ACA for granted, while also allowing the people to elect more than 60 of them for health care."
93,36,I was reading about the Obama administration and I just got back to a different article. I also found the article on the same subreddit.
93,44," I'm not against vacks mandates cuz i don't think i'll catch the cough i already had it i'm against them cuz they ruin the economy get people fired and people should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force', ''Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
93,48,"They're not talking about the ACA, they're talking about the Bush administration and the Obamacare bill."
93,56,"No, I'm a doctor who understands that Obamacare is supposed to help prevent HIV/AIDS and will support the people of obama. There are many reasons why the ACA would actually be beneficial for people with HIV/AIDS."

93,64,"You have read the article, i think it's a pretty good way to understand the topic."
93,66,"I don't think there are any things that can be said by an author. It may not be the entire conversation, but that is how it should be. It should also be said in a way that's clear and concise."

93,44,It appears he was trying to justify a tyrant who believes that his mandates aren't enough to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS.
93,48,It's a conspiracy to try and do the government a favor and the president is a tyrant.

93,82,I am a president. I have been a member of this association for a few years.

93,92,Why is Obamacare supposed to be an emergency?
93,1,It's a lot easier to find a link in r/AIDS/SupportFacts for this article to get it back to the original title than to read a full article and see what the entire thing is about. It seems the article is trying to get people to think about the US government.

93,10,"It appears that there is an issue here. A huge conspiracy theory exists in the US, it is a thing a lot of people have to make a point about."
93,12,The article is misleading. It’s not about the ACA. It’s about the Obama administration.

93,33,I was asked by a Republican a few days ago.

93,56,You're right. I'm a little embarrassed to hear this. There's no way anyone could be more obnoxious than the author of the article - even if there's an ACA that's just one of their policies - and the article is the reason the white house doesn't support their position.
93,62,This is a very interesting and important topic. You should really get an educated guess into this. The question is not the ACA. It is the way to treat healthcare.
93,64,"We are talking about the ACA repeal, and not about the Obamacare repeal. It’s not going to make the presidents life easier or easier, it’s going to make the President more capable of being an effective government and will make more Americans feel empowered. This is about the administration in general, so that’s why it’s needed."
93,66,The article explains the ACA was just a reaction to the president's intentions to a racist conspiracy to protect children.
93,67,The President will fuck up this healthcare system. But that's not the only problem.
93,70,"In all honesty, you're on the right track."
93,81,This is the president's policy. This is the shit. This is not an argument.
93,82,>The problem is that the ACA was just a reaction to the administration's intentions to a racist conspiracy to protect children.
93,90,No one would have any reason to support Obamacare if they could be an absolute narcissist and have the courage to be on the same page.
93,92,"The article makes it clear to me that this is about the ""problems of the health care system"". I mean, it's a rebranding of'remembering the president'', and it doesn't really delve into how that is a legitimate issue."
93,1,"No, he's not the one who says ""I don't think this is a part of the problem. Do you really think this is something to do with the people in the ACA, and are they aware that the government wants them to prevent them from making them come down?"""
93,2,It was a great example of what the Obama administration was trying to do. It was a reaction to the ACA. The ACA and the gov't's policies aren't really compatible.

93,10,"""The only thing the article was about."", ""The author of this article also seems to be stating that the ACA was the cause of the outbreak of AIDS in the US."
93,12,No it’s not. It’s about the whole health care system.

93,23,I don't understand why the Obamacare repeal plan is being used as an excuse.
93,24,They're not actually talking about the President. They're talking about the president's vehement opposition to the ACA repeal and repeal.
93,26,I don't think that a lot of people are recommending that you stop reading this article. You are obnoxious.
93,32,The Obama Administration and Obamacare has been arguing for a while.
93,33,"The fact that the article says ""the president is an opportunistic dictator"" is more than a conspiracy theory."
93,36,"I’m pretty sure the ACA doesn’t require consent to be implemented, but in terms of rewriting the Constitution, it does."
93,44,"... a politician has said that they're not against the repeal of Obamacare and that ""you're not against that"" (you're not against it, but that the repeal does not come close to what Obamacare actually provides). They're not tyrants or any kind of tyrants."
93,48,"""Aw, my good man. I don't get it. The Obamacare repeal is a complete scam and I doubt it's a true scam. You're right."
93,56,"I know that I am the one who thinks that he was right, but this article is misleading and misleading."
93,62,"It is a very complex issue, which is a bit different from what the US has in the past. It seems like an extremely long and very well written article with all the details - including the ACA and the White House. I don't know why there aren't enough details in it. But as long as you are being very clear that it is not the ACA, you aren't wrong about it. It is a political issue, and the article was written by a democrat, and the white house hasn't said anything on the ACA, and"
93,64,Having a hard time understanding what ACA is and how that is happening is going to make it even more difficult for people who haven't given their consent to it.
93,66,Then what's the main issue?
93,67,So how does the Obama administration come to a conclusion about the ACA?
93,70,/r/healthcare is the only place I know where you can go.
93,81,Obamacare repeal is a good example of a scam that was initiated in 1996.
93,82,"I don't know about any of this, but the person is the one who is trying to make it a ""poetry"" that gets in the way of ""what the other guy's views are""--I think it's pretty much the same, just different.

93,90,You are an idiot for putting out this article.
93,92,"This is all about the ACA. That is why we are allowed to buy and sell, to get the most out of health care, for free. This is how we get the most out of healthcare, not the insurance companies. This is why we have a lot of money to buy and sell a bunch of health insurance products. I think Obamacare is a joke, but I believe that is the point of it."
93,1,Is this a conspiracy? Is there some sort of conspiracy going on with all of this?
93,2,What's the point of the article? I think the article is wrong and I see the issue is ambiguous.
93,5,I have nothing wrong with this. The people who are against the ACA are a tyrant. I think they should just ignore the article because there are so many people that don't.
93,10,"The article goes on to say that ""the Obamacare repeal is a complete scam and I doubt it's a true conspiracy theory""."
