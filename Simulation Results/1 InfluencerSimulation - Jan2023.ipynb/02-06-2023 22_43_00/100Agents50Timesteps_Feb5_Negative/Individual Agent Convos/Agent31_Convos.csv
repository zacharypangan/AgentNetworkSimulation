59,31,Is wearing a mask the same as not wearing a mask to get a virus?
78,31,A school and a state that doesn't have a CDC mandate and a local school does not get the mandate unless they are a public health agency and not a government agency.
81,31,I love wearing my mask at night when I'm out of town.
85,31,The government is trying to do something about the spread of a virus in the us
86,31,I'm in the middle of an investigation that will uncover the extent of the mask effect.
90,31,The current strain is soooooo contagious just bc they have a mask on their hands pics don t mean they re using it
97,31,No one should be coaching a game where they can't get a helmet on and I'll go back and get a new mask
31,5,"When you wear your mask to get a virus, it makes your breath come out of your chin."
31,18,"It's really not just the first part. It's a second part, it's the second part."
31,25,I am so very surprised how many of us have never read the article. I wonder if the media thinks 'wearing a mask' is a legitimate cause of the spread of a virus?
40,31,I'm going to assume that this is the first time they have actually put a ban on a helmet that has a whistle on it.
59,31,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I feel like that is more like a saying than a response.
78,31,"You know what, I think the people who think that the CDC doesn't have a mandate or a mandate are just as crazy."
81,31,"This hasn't happened in the US since 1907, and it hasn't."
85,31,You should go to Georgia if you want. I wouldn't worry about it happening and I wouldn't think about it putting a mask on.
86,31,I like the way this is written: I don't think the idea of wearing a mask means that one can't take off his mask. It's a bit like saying that the best way to protect yourself is to let someone put on a mask in the middle of a restaraunt.
90,31,"This is soooooo interesting. The US government is spreading a virus to people that can’t even pick it up without a mask, which they say is an excellent reason not to do so. Do you have a photo of them?"

31,5,"Wearing a mask to get a virus makes your breath come out of your chin, it's really not just the first part. It's a second part, it's the second part."
31,18,"Exactly why he said ""I wear my mask to get a virus, it makes my breath come out of my chin."""
31,25,"They can't just just put it on or wear it on, it's just a way to get people to put on a mask and then it goes on the bus to the airport and take it to the government for a medical inspection. You have to take a helmet on a VERY small part of your face, and wear a mask on your head if you're worried about your lungs."
40,31,"It is not an issue in policing, it is an issue in the health department that is not involved with anything related to vaccinations."
59,31,"I'm in Georgia, I would not 'wear a mask'."
78,31,I'm sorry but that is just a joke! Is this the case? Is the CDC a government agency? Is the CDC involved with the CDC's program for public health?
81,31,I'm going to be the first one to make a comment.
85,31,>I think the US government does not enforce anti-virus laws. People have been banned from wearing masks for years because of this.
86,31,"I think it's about time we put a stop to this. This is so depressing that our president has walked through the restaraunt, you can't tell when you're not wearing the mask if you don't get the mask off."
90,31,"I'm not an attorney, but I do have a citation of the guy, a mask."
97,31,"I think this is one of the reasons you are still not going to get into college basketball, because the masks are also a way of blocking off the game in order to prevent the spread of a virus. Obviously it is not the best or smartest thing to do, but I don't know why you're downvoted. Is it like he said he's just a joke?"
31,5,"I'm from a small town in a small town, Georgia and I can only recall seeing the guy and the people he was talking to, and seeing him in a large city for his first visit. I remember that, and that guy was going to eat it too. He was doing a little sex stuff in one of those cities and they said he was trying to get a ""sex-related"" job (which is probably what they were doing to prevent spread of viruses a bit), and the people he was talking to had a different state than the government."
31,18,The article seems to have gotten more and more popular recently. I'm sorry but it seems the government hasn't had a mandate on the topic.
31,25,>I don't think the idea of wearing a mask means that one can't take off his mask. It's a bit like saying that the best way to protect yourself is to let someone put on a mask in the middle of a restaraunt.
40,31,He sounds like a great guy.
59,31,"I'm allergic to HIV and the government has been bringing you a ""Violence Vaccine for all"" response."
78,31,So the kids wearing the mask are getting sick and not being vaccinated?
81,31,"In general, people who want to wear masks and masks are actually smart. In a way, the most common way to protect yourself is to go on a date with a friend or family member, not a stranger. If you are gonna be the first one to make a comment, I recommend it. You can do this all you want with your head on the floor, your arms on the floor or on your face, any way you want. If you don't mind the idea, you can get the job done. If you don't want to be a friend, you should"
85,31,"I'm really not surprised, I think you're very kind. And I don't think you can argue that a face mask or some kind of mask is a good idea to be able to stop a virus in Georgia. Is it just a simple matter of how many people you have and the many people who have."
86,31,I do not think that wearing a mask would be considered protection. A person who is in the middle of a investigation to discover the extent of the mask effect needs to have a safety vest on and be dressed properly.
90,31,So what does he have a photo of?
97,31,"The best thing to do in a professional sport, however, is to say that no one should be doing this because it's too much work and would be a big hassle for the players."
31,5,>I'm sorry but it seems the government hasn't had a mandate on the topic.
31,18,A lot of people who want to wear a mask say that their skin is a bit hazy. They are also using a fake mask.
31,25,My dad is in Georgia and he is allergic to HIV and the government has a mandate on his head. I remember seeing the guy's fucking face and he was in the middle of the restaraunt.

59,31,"This sub is doing a great job of illustrating what they're trying to do in the last 5 years. There's no way you should really complain about this, you should really do something about it."
78,31,You might think the government is not interested in the problem at hand?
81,31,"It is so sad that I don't know what to say about it. I'm sure he has a huge backlog of people in this thread, but it's not the same sort of thing as OP is suggesting."
85,31,"Vaccinating your dog is a big deal. But, in all seriousness, if someone is exposing the human body to a virus then they should be doing the same thing, as the person describing it."
86,31,I see a lot of people here saying it's not worth putting on a mask. It's about time you put a stop to it.

40,31,I've had some people have a fight against using the NSA's protection apparatus. The idea of making it illegal to wear a mask doesn't seem fair or ethically wrong.
59,31,...which is why I am concerned with your privacy....the people who do not care about this are the most important in this country. They deserve to be treated like that and be treated like shit.
78,31,Nope. The CDC is not involved in the program for public health. The mask laws don't even mention it.
81,31,"ahhhhhh, this isn't funny at all."
85,31,"I would love to read this article to you. Vaccination is possible to prevent HIV in Georgia, but a mask is not a good idea."

31,25,The government should be able to be more responsible. We should put up with that.
40,31,"""Since it is not a joke, I think the government should be taking steps to reduce public exposure and restrict the use of the head mask. It's been very helpful in finding the evidence of what was being done."
59,31,IANAL. I'm a huge fan of people who believe in masks in Australia. And I'm pretty sure they've seen a lot of them.
78,31,Is there anything I can do about this?
81,31,"I'm not a huge fan of any type of political manipulation, but I know this is probably one of those cases in which the idea that ""shocking"" in a nutshell is an acceptable use of edgy sexist humor. The sexism in this context is a serious issue."
85,31,Are you serious? Vaccination is not a big deal. The only thing that can be done about it is to put it on.
86,31,"""The hivemind is on, but they don't have a choice. They just have more responsibility."""
90,31,> The whole ACA thing is ridiculous.
97,31,"A good coach has the power to slash people. The coach may want to see if there are any more jokes about the coach but the article is about a guy who slammed his post into his head, and why is it a joke. He should have spelled it correctly. The player is clearly a dick and if he isn't on the team he's a dick."
31,5,"I know many people who believe that there's something wrong. I mean, the first one I read in the film is a joke about a guy slamming his head into his head because he wants to wear a mask on the team. The second one I read is not relevant to the title, but it's not relevant to the context."
31,18,"Yes, this is a joke."
31,25,The problem with these cases is that a lot of the comments are sexist and inaccurate. This has nothing to do with the US ACA. The article is about a guy who slammed his post into his head. The only thing that can be done about it is to put it on.
40,31,"[The Man Who Doesn't Sleep With Trump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pippini, Wisconsin) is a political group of journalists expressing their dissatisfaction with the idea that the NSA is part of the NSA's protection apparatus. It's an example of how the government wants the NSA to have a serious job to do preventing the spread of a virus."
59,31,No wonder people here do not care about the federal government or healthcare. It's like being the only person in the world not to wear a mask to get sick and the way the US is treating the people with HIV. It's not like the government will ever want to fix what they don't want.
78,31,The government doesn't have a mandate.
81,31,"A lot of this is from a guy who says he's wearing a mask, not the guy who is wearing a mask. The NSA wants to stop it but he has no authority in his mind to tell his friends. It's funny because the person is saying it in front of a guy. This isn't even funny, you can only imagine if someone is going to tell them it's a joke or sexist to make fun of his own narcissism or racism or sexism, which sexism"
85,31,I'm not a fan of the Obama Administration but I do like the fact that the ACA is in full force
86,31,The idea of wearing a mask is not a question. A question like that is in some ways irrelevant and a good question to answer. It sounds like your post is in part about the 'hivemind'. You're being sarcastic.
90,31,The entire ACA thing is ridiculous. The movie is a great book. I love that satire of the government. I think the movie is a great book. I love that satire of the government.
97,31,What if they used a mask to mask his head?
31,5,It's no joke. It's a joke.
31,18,That's why the movie is good.
31,25,There's a big problem with the ACA: there isn't any way to control the spread of a virus.
40,31,I just read it on Netflix. There's nothing worse than being in a room with a CDC mask. I just want to be clear about the meaning of the ''Nieto joke''. I didn't realize it was a joke until I read the first chapter of the movie.
59,31,I would not wear a mask. I'm allergic to HIV. The NSA can't fuck out of the government.

31,5,It's not a joke. It's a joke.
31,18,"I know that the word mask has a lot of negative connotations, but the idea of wearing it for a good reason. There are a few people in this thread who aren't really interested in Vaccination, but are interested in their own."
31,25,A lot of the comments are sexist and inaccurate. This has nothing to do with the US ACA.
40,31,It's a joke about the CIA and the CDC destroying people's lives by giving them a mask to wear during a war.
59,31,"It's actually a really bad idea to wear a mask to prevent the spread of HIV, and if you aren't allergic to HIV, they do not need to be in your house to use it to infect people with it."

The article says that the President doesn't wear a mask because he's in the middle of a big fight, that he doesn't want to be the leader of this nation, and that the media is being resentful of the president he's expressing his anger against."
31,5,"So, the movie isn't about the government? It's about the president and the gov't. They're just making jokes. There's no real good reason not to wear a mask. They are just making jokes about the people."
31,18,A lot of people are a bit disappointed in what the movie says. What's so amazing about it is that there is a big problem with the ACA: there isn't any way to control the spread of a virus. It makes my breath come out of my chin. It's not just that it makes my breath come out of my chin. The movie also makes me hiccups in what I read. I could see what it meant but I could also see what it meant in general
31,25,Is this the same fucking story that was posted in the article?
40,31,I don't even have any knowledge of this movie.

90,31,"The main problem isn't the mask, it's the government. AIDS is a huge problem and is getting infected. I don't know if it's the ACA, or if it's the ACA itself. The ACA is a huge issue and a good way to prevent it."

31,5,"The movie was a joke, but it was also a reference to a guy who wore a mask on a team he was coaching. I don't know much about the story and I'm pretty sure the film isn't relevant. It just didn't fit well. It's just an old joke."
31,18,I think the joke here is what it's about.
31,25,"I've heard stories like this all day. I think I've made the mistake of reading the headlines and reading the articles and ignoring them.

59,31,"I'm not talking about the mask thing, it is about the people who are saying something to the effect of being the only people not to wear a mask, it is the media 'politics' in this subreddit."
78,31,"You know, people just make jokes. Just don't do them anymore."
81,31,I think it's interesting that the NSA seems to be trying to prevent people from getting an AIDS vaccine in the face of a lot of threats.
85,31,"""I don't think a face mask is an acceptable use of the federal ACA. Vaccination is not a big deal. The only thing that can be done about it is to put it on."

90,31,I don't think this movie is good. The author is completely untrue about it. It's a very good example of how the Obama administration has dealt with the health care system.
97,31,I don't understand why the president should do this. He's not a leader.

40,31,Is it because he is a huge supporter of the ACA? I think they're trying to stop a certain type of person from being allowed to wear their mask when the President is not playing a game he is not playing in a hospital. He is trying to make it so he could continue to play. That is a bit ridiculous.

81,31,"A government agency that deals with a disease called the AIDS pandemic explains this whole thing. I don't think anyone here has ever heard of someone doing it.

31,18,"I think there is a lot of disagreement and disagreement on both sides. The first point in the movie is that people aren't necessarily interested in AIDS, but they are interested in CDC and CDC."

78,31,"The ACA is a joke. You gotta wear a mask to fight the flu, you gotta wear a mask to fight AIDS."
81,31,This is not sexist humor. You're just trying to tell me that 'Shocking is a big lie' and that you don't understand what the CDC's job is and they're trying to prevent the spread of HIV. '
85,31,"A friend of mine was recently asked to buy a face mask. He said he was going to buy a headband, so he thought it would be interesting to see. I told him that they were doing something in an effort to stop the spread of HIV, and they wanted to have some advice for him. And when we tried to go to school and get vaccinated, he said he wanted to wear a face mask. Then he asked if he wanted one, because he thought it would be an effective way to stop HIV, because that would help prevent the spread"
86,31,"That sucks. They've taken it too far. This isn't a joke, and it's not even close to an actual joke."
90,31,"This sounds like a very rudimentary but effective way of discussing the topic, especially the president and administration. I guess I'll just have to say: I don't think the book is good. The author is completely untrue about it."

I mean, the first one I read in the article is a joke, but it was also a reference to a joke about a guy who slaps his head into the head because he's allergic to HIV."
31,18,"i think that people should be able to choose which sex is good for them if they are not allergic to AIDS - but there are other problems to deal with that is the ACA. It's not funny at all - he's telling a story, the ACA isn't a joke, it's a joke - he's trying to make a joke, and if it's a joke, then there's no sense in him avoiding any of this."
31,25,I thought the article was 'the problem with these cases is that a lot of the comments are sexist and inaccurate. This has nothing to do with the US ACA.
40,31,He's a joke to all of the others.
59,31,"I've been a big fan of masks in the past, especially at the Obama campaign. It amounted to a much broader and more accurate stance than a lot of people have in the past."
78,31,"It's a joke that you don't think it's funny, because it's a joke."
81,31,I don't understand why you would think that a person who is a snob would feel comfortable putting on a mask and doing so without a mask. What the heck?
85,31,Vaccination is one of the most effective ways to stop the spread of HIV.
86,31,"In other words, if you're a fan of the President, you have a great opinion."
90,31,The movie is a great example of how the administration has dealt with the healthcare system. I enjoy watching it as a good example of how the Obama administration is treating all Americans.
97,31,"""I love coaching however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops. I think the president should not play sports because it would cause a lot of stress on the adolescent players'mental states."

78,31,>I think the biggest issue facing America is the fact that the anti-semitic acts aren't the biggest problems in the US.
81,31,I know this is weird. I'm not a big fan of all kinds of political manipulation. I just think it's odd that a lot of people are still trying to figure out what the ACA is for.
85,31,"The thing that stands out to me is that wearing a mask would be the best way to stop the spread of HIV. If you can't control the spread of HIV, then a mask is not going to get you into the disease. The problem is people wearing a mask don't know how to walk because they think it's bad. It's not like he's just trying to understand why the other commenters are pointing out that ''this is not a joke. It's a joke."
86,31,"As a Canadian, I don't think you understand the distinction between what you're saying and what I'm saying. Unless a person isn't actually a doctor, there is a lot of conflict."

78,31,"""That's why it's a joke."""
81,31,I'd be really surprised if the CDC had never seen the movie that a lawyer's comment was like.
85,31,I'm sorry. I'm afraid they are not saying what you're saying.

59,31,The CDC's campaign is full of anti-virus propaganda and it's a major problem.
78,31,So I'll be pretty sure the biggest problem facing America is that the anti-Semitic acts aren't the biggest problems in the US?
81,31,"I know that some people have problems with politics, but I never seem to see them - at least in the USA."
85,31,I think the joke is just that people are being insensitive to the actual facts of the joke.

59,31,I’m not sure what the article is about.
78,31,The Obama era is over. In the book the guy's mother was wearing a mask and her father had to use a mask for treatment. The guy's mother thought the mask was supposed to prevent the spread of a virus. The guy's mother thought the mask was supposed to prevent the spread of a virus.
81,31,"It's a joke to make fun of that guy, ""I was just trying to say, there's really no shame in being a man."
85,31,"You're doing what's right, and he has to get vaccinated."
86,31,"As a person who has had an epidural and snooped out at the White House, I'm concerned about your personal safety."
90,31,I am just saying that the whole shaming of the book is a bad example of how the Obama administration has dealt with the healthcare system.
97,31,">[The topic of the article was the president with the mask, not the players with AIDS.'"
31,5,There's a good argument in the article that the ACA is a prank but not about it. It's not about the CDC and the CDC. It's about how the healthcare system is treating people with HIV. The CDC wasn't putting on a mask. They were putting on a mask. They were putting on a mask.
31,18,The CDC is trying to discredit the US and the CDC in the face of it.
31,25,"You seem to be getting a bit spoiled, but you've got to be an adult. I can't understand how you're feeling."
40,31,"“But to be completely blunt - it isn’t a joke. It’s a joke. It’s a prank. It’s a joke, but it’s a joke.”"
59,31,Honestly I would say that the whole thing isn't going to change any time soon. What's happening isn't happening. This isn't a joke.
78,31,"The ACA, in addition to being about a drug, was written by a huuuge antisemite who thinks that the government should take care of the public health problems in a manner that would benefit them. The ACA is designed to address the problem of HIV, and it addresses that problem."
81,31,"You've got a lot of ideas and information that would be useful for a man, especially in such a situation. I think the idea of being a joke is something I am not very familiar with."
85,31,This ACA and the American AIDS Alliance are both good examples of the seriousness of this issue.
86,31,The ACA is a joke.
90,31,"I can't even imagine who the person you posted here would be. I'm the president, he doesn't seem very civil about the matter. I can see the difference between the one who tells you that it is funny, and the one who tells you it is a joke, and he's probably just lying about it if it's true, but that's not the reason he is putting it off."
97,31,There is a troll in the US in the headlines:
31,5,"""But I'm pretty sure the article isn't relevant to the context."""
31,18,"Why would people wear a mask outside? If not, the whole idea is a joke."
31,25,I think this whole thing isn't going to change any time soon.
40,31,This article is very interesting. The main question that needs to be addressed is: What are these pranks that we need to address and how to stop them?
59,31,Is the whole thing about the ACA a joke? Is the ACA a joke? Isn't it about the health issues? Because it seems like there's a slew of hypocrisy underlying it.
78,31,"This is all part of the joke, not the actual ACA."
81,31,We're all not on the same page.
85,31,"I don't know what you're talking about. You are right to disagree that this is a joke. You are right to agree that the whole thing is a joke, and that this is the best way to stop HIV/AIDS. You need to have a real conversation with your friend about it."
86,31,That's a pretty cool way to make a joke and you can get away with it. A nice sarcastic sentence if I could!
90,31,"I don't know about the actual issues, but I'm not sure what's wrong with a mask on a person."
97,31,"'The entire point of it all is to stop the spread of a virus.'''The article says that the president does not wear a mask because he's in the middle of a big fight, that he doesn't want to be the leader of this nation, and that the media is being resentful of the president's expressing his anger against."
