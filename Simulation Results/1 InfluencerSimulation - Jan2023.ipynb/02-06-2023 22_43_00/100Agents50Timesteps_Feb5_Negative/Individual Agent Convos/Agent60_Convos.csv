78,60,two tri county health dept board members from douglas county voted against the mask public health order and one did not vote due to affiliation to a school
88,60,i m going to say this about twitchcon and masks you can hate me if the state town doesn t have an mandates you can t get mad that an event doesn t not sure if sd has any mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask
90,60,yes the newest strain is soooooo contagious just bc they have a mask on their hands pics don t mean they re using it
60,4,I have been a vaccinated person in the states for many years. I have been vaccinated as well. I have even been in a hospital.
60,14,> Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus
60,27,People will be on their way to the president's house to watch a movie... so here's how it was done in 2012
60,42,The mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
60,57,You should do some reading of this bc you are ignorant of a lot of stuff that is just about politics
65,60,We have to have a law that does not require you to wear a mask or get the jab.
68,60,I love watching law and order play. I'm a fan of the president but my team would rather not be putting myself in a position to make the game safe than get caught in a terrible situation.
78,60,Apparently they're wearing the order because the teacher erect a huge scar on the girl's head.
88,60,i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask
90,60,"IANAL, but I agree with you, the mask is effective to prevent infection, preventing coughing and causing a lot of other illnesses."
60,4,if you wear a mask and turn yourself in oh and every day he doesn t people will die starting tonight i m a man of my word covid
60,14,> Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus People will be on their way to the president's house to watch a movie... so here's how it was done in 2012
60,27,Apparently they're wearing the order because the teacher erect a huge scar on the girl's head.
60,42,"OP, is he a doctor?"
60,57,"I don't know why it's a big deal. A mask isn't actually necessary to stop the spread of a virus, just to stop a healthy person from taking sick patients or dying, but it's also an easy way to prevent people from getting sick from the virus and preventing people from getting sick, too. Until the government makes a rash like that then a mask isn't required."
65,60,What do you mean. It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. The school did not like the mask public health order. I'm sure the other gov't members would be more upset by the mask public health order.
68,60,I wouldn't worry about being a fullback but it's a big problem if you are a fullback.
78,60,"""We want to prevent the spread of the virus, I'll wear a mask in a heartbeat if you don't wear a mask... It's one of the most important measures deployed by the government"""
88,60,Vaccines are not the right. You should not have to do it. You shouldn't have a medical necessity to do it.
90,60,Isn't it just a thing of the past where a man has a reversible disease and a medical mask?

60,42,"I mean, i understand how you feel, but i would not want a kid with a reversible disease who needs a mask, and therefore does not need to wear a mask."
60,57,I’m a doctor and I wear a mask all the time. The whole medical aspect of it is pretty much the same.
65,60,"- because the government needs to stop putting themselves at risk. It's very simple, no one should be putting the public health department on the wrong track. If someone wants to be vaccinated, they should just take their own life and move on. I'm not sure how he is in this."
68,60,"[Making a mask in public is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.So I don't have to wear a mask in public in order to stop a virus. I like you, and i agree with you I love watching law and order play. I'm a fan of the president but my team would rather not be putting myself in a position to make the game safe than get caught in a terrible situation. I'd like a reversal of the facts here."
78,60,"I don't even know what to do. I'm a little embarrassed if I hear something like this. I'm afraid we've only been around a year. It's not like a real joke and only a prank, but that doesn't change the fact that it isn't even in our statute or the law."
88,60,People in this sub are being extremely rude.
90,60,"CANNOTANSWER: he has HIV that he hasn't gotten in a reversible disease yet. He has a mask on his hands, but no other mask."
60,4,The people are actually being a little bit of a bullshit here.
60,14,"I know, right? Vaccines are not necessary to stop a virus. The mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. Apparently they're wearing the order because the teacher erect a huge scar on the girl's head."

60,42,I don't know. You can't tell me.
60,57,"This is the OP's story. I don't know why he's being upset by it but I do know the school did not like it. It's really just because the schools are doing it in a different way. If you were a student and have a mask on your hands, but no other mask on your hands, you would probably just want to sit through the whole thing."
65,60,The CDC is doing something to save lives in the CDC. They must be responsible for their actions.
68,60,I’m not a lawyer but I love watching law and order play.
78,60,"We have a lot of doctors and hospitals that provide you with the necessary care. There is some truth to this, but it's still the biggest joke of the 20th century."
88,60,"The actual problem is how many people wear masks, and when it happens, they die."
90,60,"The only one who could understand how the government is ignoring a problem that the government has to address is the president. That's what the president is supposed to do, but he wants to save his friend."
60,4,"It's kind of an incredibly shady remark. But, I wouldn't want to risk my life because it's so obvious unless you're trying to make a joke or you're a lawyer or someone who hasn't made it out of their mind."
60,14,Because they aren't putting people at risk. The fact that someone has HIV or any reversible disease is a rip off of the actual facts. The people at the school who don't think that would be an issue to address.
60,27,"I would rather have a friend who has a reversible disease and a medical mask than a guy who has a reversible disease, even though his mask is on his hands."
60,42,"This isn't a real joke, it's actually an important one, and I just wanted to point out a bit about a good friend of mine who had a virus."
60,57,Vaccines are NOT a prank.
65,60,"> I'm a man who wears a mask all the time to fight cancer and his family. So, you're defending the mask, and the schools for not putting a mask on the other students, and in the US, not wanting to provide anyone with access to the CDC? IANAL, but I believe if a government organization has a policy like this, then they aren't going to be as good as it appears to be. The reason they are so incompetent is because a large percentage of the public care that they receive is due to"
68,60,"I like to call this a ""dick masked in a suit, but I can't afford to take the same risks. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
78,60,"It's not like the government is doing a joke. It's a prank, and that's not fair."
88,60,"I don't know if you can explain how much people are in the comments, but I think that you were trying to justify that there were people in the comments who were just trying to make a joke or simply trying to explain why they were trying to cover up the fact that they weren't vaccinated. The CDC is not going to do anything about it, and they don't seem to be adamant on that the government has a good interest in preventing transmission."

60,27,"The president of the United States of America, who has lived through the epidemic, is going to be a hero. He will be seen with the public as well as others and will be remembered for his stance on the matter. That is a pretty common misconception."
60,42,"It's a prank, but it's an important one."
60,57,"Nope, this is the shady part."
65,60,If you're not wearing a mask then why don't you just get to know the state and then get a medical diagnosis?
68,60,A lawmaker who isn't wearing his mask in public tells me to put on a hat.
78,60,There is nothing that can stop this from happening in this country. This is not really true. We are in the US and we know what the problem is and what we should do to stop it. If you ever find yourself in the govt or do any government service you should contact the Health Department and ask for assistance. We are in the US and they can help you.
88,60,I'm not sure if you've seen that one.
90,60,It is a great example of a great movie. I enjoy watching it as a good example of the ACA. I think it's cool that the ACA has not been implemented yet unless it is the one that's really affecting the health care industry.
60,4,... I want to go on a limb and say it in a sarcastic and witty way.
60,14,I'm assuming it was done in 2012 by a student from the school.
60,27,The Obama administration isn't going to do anything about the Obama ACA because they don't want the people to suffer.
60,42,"if you wear a mask, you are going to be a hero. This is a great example of a great movie. I'm not sure what you have seen, but I enjoy watching this movie as a great example of the ACA."
60,57,I feel that it's not fair for the health care industry to take on the role of an individual by refusing to put on a medical mask on their hands. They're not going to take the responsibility of what they want out of their resentment or interest in making a joke about someone who had a virus.
65,60,"Those are the 'bad things' about public health, which is actually how the US has the public health department."
68,60,"I don't think it's really a joke, he said it because he said it because he's the only one who has the responsibility to stop the spread of a virus, and this is a joke. It's a joke."
78,60,This is a really good story.
88,60,I've seen it. I don't understand why the CDC has a big problem with the vaccination. The one that's making fun of people.
90,60,I read the ACA a couple of years back. The whole ACA thing is ridiculous.
60,4,So what did the ACA say about the US? I've only seen that one.
60,14,It's just this story... I can't believe the president is in the White House.
60,27,"I'm going to say that this seems rather ridiculous. You're not being a hero, that is all. The president is making fun of the US, so I can't say you're being a hero. The govt is making fun of the people who are a hero."
60,42,"A lawmaker in my state, who didn't have the right to wear a medical mask, told me that he would be a hero."
60,57,I would be upset if they didn't do this. I would be able to get away with it.
65,60,"If you are not going to go to a hospital in order to get treatment for your own disease, you will need a medical ID, you can wear your own mask for a medical diagnosis but only if the emergency is medically necessary."
68,60,It's a joke. This is a joke. This is a joke.
78,60,It's so funny when people talk about the idea of a mask.
88,60,"I was vaccinated a few times. They don't seem to have any actual reason to believe I wasn't vaccinated, but I just don't see how it can be a big deal to anyone."
90,60,"I don't know the movie, but I'm pretty sure that you're right."
60,4,"aww, you mean like wearing a mask."
60,14,"You're actually being a little bit of a bullshit here. I know, right? Vaccines are not necessary to stop a virus. The mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
60,27,[Obamacare Act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BillWoman_Bill/BillWoman): 'I don't understand why the CDC has a big problem with the ACA. The whole ACA thing is ridiculous. So what did the ACA say about the US?
60,42,RIP gov. s. 1:32
60,57,This isn't a joke. This is a movie.
65,60,"It's one thing to get a doctor to get vaccinated - to take a face, a mask, a mask."
68,60,"""Making a mask in public is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
78,60,"My fav shits was an advertisement to wear a mask and we're going to the cinema. My fav one was the mummy thing in the movie, where the mascot was just in front of the camera, so it got thrown around. But I didn't see the part about the a prank of someone stealing my shirt."
88,60,I just want to know why i don't want to do it. I have no idea how the CDC could vaccinate me.
90,60,"I don't think it's ""sexist"" or ""sexist"" to ask your mom, OP."
60,4,"I've gotta say the most important part of the whole ACA is that if it's not the government's job to prevent people from getting vaccinated, it's the government's job to prevent it from being a big deal."
60,14,"It was a joke, but that is not what it's about."
60,27,It's not a joke. It's a joke.
60,42,You are not being a hero. You are being a hero.
60,57,"Vaccines are NOT a prank. A CDC mandates a ""no contact"" with your head."
65,60,"I think your comment would raise a significant discussion on what is happening in the US. A mask can be a medical device, and is used to treat people with HIV/AIDS. I don't believe you can't take care of yourself without a mask."
68,60,"I'd like to call this a ""dick masked in a suit, but I can't afford to take the same risks."
78,60,"This was one of my favorite pranks, I don't have much to explain to my wife but I would definitely suggest not getting involved - it is a joke."
88,60,"Because they don't like people in the comments who are trying to make a joke. They aren't really trying to make a joke, just a hygienic way to try to avoid a health issue."
90,60,Is the movie based on your research?
60,4,"I think you are missing a crucial part. It was a joke, but that is not what the movie is about. It's based on some research by the authors."
60,14,That's the whole point of the ACA. Vaccines are not necessary to stop a virus. They are not necessary to stop the spread of a virus. They're not necessary to stop a virus.
60,27,It is not a joke. It is a joke.
60,42,RIP Bill W. & Mrs. D.
60,57,"This is a joke, not a prank. This is a movie about the CDC."
65,60,I don't know how you don't like this prank. Is the CDC involved in AIDS control?
68,60,"What's it about the ACA that isn't a joke? A lot of people who don't understand what he's talking about. That's a big, a fucking troll."
78,60,"It's like saying ""I don't think it's a joke"" to a guy who wears a mask because of his ineptitude, and also because of his syringe. I wouldn't say it's a joke. It's a joke that everyone is willing to prank. I think you are overreacting here."
88,60,That's a really stupid question.
90,60,"CANNOTANSWER'S BAD PARTY: Wearing a medical mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. People need to think they can be smarter than a cynical and self-righteous, sexist, violent, and rational, and just as a bit selfish as the people who aren't going to talk about the fact that they can't go to the doctor without the mask. There is no excuse for the health care system."
60,4,"I know what you are getting at, but that's why it's a joke."
60,14,Vaccines are not necessary to stop a virus.
60,27,It is a joke. It is a joke.
60,42,"If it is not the CDC, it is not a prank."
60,57,"There's no ""respect"" for the CDC. They are just doing it to keep the school from putting their shit together."
65,60,"I'm sorry, but I don't think you are referring to the health issue as the problem, but the CDC is in fact a very powerful agency in the CDC's power in terms of health care."
68,60,"I like it when my friends talk about ACA and don't say anything about it at all. My mother says that it is a joke, but I think I would be too stupid to think about it."
78,60,The whole ACA is a prank and the whole ACA is a joke.
88,60,"> ""Vaccines are the best way to stop the spread of a virus. Please wear masks. A bit of sarcasm, I find it really funny. The hammer being on my face is not a joke if you don't want to be the one to say it. I am so sorry. The president is trying to get a proper policy on this. Vaccines are the best way to stop the spread of a virus."
90,60,So why is this movie going to make the public think about the Obama administration?
60,4,"[Personally speaking, this is about people who've never really been vaccinated and don't know how to wear a mask... and why he has no job to keep them safe."
60,14,> A lot of people who don't understand what he's talking about.
60,27,The CDC will go on a public troll tour in the next day.
60,42,I agree with the other commenters.
60,57,Isn't that one of those ridiculous remark that I can't even read? Because there is a whole lot of stuff written about the ACA and not just this one.
65,60,"That was so obnoxious. Regardless of the fact that I said it, I feel like I'm just joking."
68,60,>What's it about the ACA that isn't a joke? A lot of people who don't understand what he's talking about.
78,60,This is a prank and the ACA is a joke.
88,60,"You don't get a free vaccinate at all. It's a nice gesture, but not really useful if you can't get vaccinate."
90,60,I don't know what to tell you but in the movie the guy is in the doctor's office with a mask on.
60,4,I think the problem with this movie is that we should be able to vote for the president for the first time.
60,14,"No, that isn't an issue. The CDC's a very powerful agency in the CDC's power in terms of health care."
60,27,"...the CDC raging on the ACA was kinda a joking remark. It's a joke, it's a prank."
60,42,This is the best example of a great movie.
60,57,I'm assuming you aren't referring to the ACA.
65,60,"Yes, we must put our mask on every single person on the planet. We are able to get a virus, we need a new health care system, we can get treatment, we are getting better, we are able to get a disease, we can get a healthy body. We can all get an AIDS cure and we need to get the CDC and the FDA into action."
68,60,Why are there so many stupid comments? Are there too many uninformed comments?
78,60,"He is just doing a joke, not an actual joke. That is what the CDC is talking about."
88,60,"I think this is about ""Is that what I really want to do with my life?"" but I just don't get it. I don't think I'm going to wear a mask because I don't see what a joke is about. Is it really a joke about how much people think it's a petty thing?"
90,60,"I'm going to take the remark out on it, but I think the best one I could think of is ""I am a doctor, my doctor is a doctor, but I am not a doctor."""
60,4,The actual problem with this movie is that we should be able to vote for the president for the first time.
60,14,I know that a lot of people don't understand what the ACA means. We need to put the mask on every single person in the world. Vaccines aren't the right. You shouldn't have to do it. You should not have a medical necessity to do it.
60,27,Isn't he using a mask and being embarrassed by the people talking about him?
60,42,You're the one who should do the best you can and tell us what a great movie it is.
60,57,"There are a lot of issues and issues that are not on the agenda at this point, and it's not that there's no chance of the ACA being implemented."
65,60,Isn't it the schools in the states that have their CDC on the side?
68,60,"This sub is full of funny, uninspiring, and uninformed comments."
78,60,"There is nothing on the internet that will stop the CDC from working on the issue. It's more like ""We want to prevent the spread of a virus, I'll wear a mask in a heartbeat if you don't wear a mask."""
88,60,What is the name of the person in the post?
90,60,They've been putting pressure on the government to fix a virus.
60,4,What he said is a prank. A prank or a joke? The answer is that the people are being a little bit jacked up.
60,14,The CDC is talking about the need to get the CDC and FDA into action.
60,27,Its also hard to imagine how much more fun the ACA is than the current ones and that it would take for the govt to do.
60,42,">How about it be a joke, is that what a joke is about?"
60,57,Is that what they want to do with the world? I don't know where to begin to figure that out.
65,60,"I think that they're actually trying to make the problem more important. You should be proud that they don't think the government should be working in their interest, and not be in an effort to make the issue more important to the people."
68,60,"In general, this is not an easy joke. It is the part that makes us feel so bad. We aren't allowed to put our hand up in front of other people's faces."

78,60,I'm sorry this happened. I'm not a doctor or any doctor.
88,60,The CDC has a job to get everyone vaccinated and help in this.
90,60,"I read the book, but I'm a doctor and the movie is sexist. The movie is a bad example of the ACA."

65,60,I was able to do that in one school in high school and it's not an option but I've been able to get a mask that could help people. It's not in a bad way.
68,60,The issue isn't just about the ACA. They need to make it more of an acceptable use. The issue is that the masks are more expensive and people who are at risk of getting sick and hurt will wear a mask.
78,60,"As an American who's been in this situation a few times, I've realized that the whole problem of HIV and AIDS is not the same. You don't know how many people in the US wear masks? Because the ACA is one of the biggest problems in the world. It's a joke."
88,60,I don't understand how people get mad about the CDC or the other anti-vaccine groups.
90,60,Those are the ones I don't think would ever be the people that actually want to be a prankster.

65,60,"I'm very sorry this happened, but this is a really bad joke. You are talking about some people who don't really understand the meaning of a joke, and you have no idea what a joke is. It is one of those things where you put the mask on yourself and ask for a new job."
68,60,You may have heard of Obamacare but not the ACA? It's the biggest and most controversial health issue in the world.

60,14,You can do whatever you want with the ACA. Vaccines don't make it necessary and you shouldn't need a medical necessity to do it.
60,27,I think it is because the ACA is a joke because the CDC is in charge of the health care system.
60,42,Isn't the whole idea that the ACA is a joke?
60,57,"This is why the Obama administration is so critical of ACA, essentially ignoring the fact that it’s not a joke and instead is a big joke."
65,60,"It doesn't seem like it will change. A lot of people are going to find out that this is not a joke, and are probably just pointing out that they aren't going to change the way it sounds. They just have to take the issue seriously."

78,60,CANNOTANSWER is a prankster.
88,60,People who don't vaccinate are getting better. You're sick. No one can tell when to do it and have a hard time getting vaccinated because they aren't sure.
90,60,"The movie is not about the ACA, but the ACA."
60,4,Because we're not getting vaccinated enough for this to be a joke.
60,14,Why isn't the president putting the mask on the entire student body? That's a joke.
60,27,What a joke! It's such a joke! We are a joke.
60,42,This isn't the ACA. It's the Obama administration and the ACA.

68,60,Obamacare is going to continue with its negative effects. But I think the Obamacare plan is actually a good idea.
78,60,CANNOTANSWER : The ACA is a joke because it addresses the problem of AIDS. The ACA is a joke because it addresses the problem of AIDS.
88,60,Vaccines are a legitimately important thing in a country. You can go anywhere with a mandate that you aren't sure if a person is vaccinated. Its a health problem.
90,60,"I do not believe the movie is about the ACA, but the ACA is about a medical mask, not a medical prank."
60,4,">""The only one who could understand how the government is ignoring a problem that the government has to address is the president. The reason they are so incompetent is because a large percentage of the public care that they receive is due to """"We want to prevent the spread of the virus, I'll wear a mask in a heartbeat if you don't wear a mask... and why he has no job to keep them safe."""""
60,14,I don't even know the word 'joke'. It sounds like it's an issue for Obama to get on board with if the president takes it too seriously.
60,27,"I'm not an expert on the subject, but I believe the ACA is a joke because it addresses the problem of AIDS. Vaccines are a legitimately important thing in a country. You can go anywhere with a mandate that you aren't sure if a person is vaccinated. Its a health problem."
60,42,CANNOTANSWER is a joke.
60,57,"The Obama administration has been doing this with the intent of removing the Affordable Care Act. If you want to know more about Obamacare, you need to know that 'What the ACA does' isn't a joke."
65,60,There's nothing wrong with wearing a mask to protect the health of the person.
68,60,I would hate to have to do this. Unless it's a joke. It is a joke. It's a joke.

60,14,They're not necessary to stop HIV. They are not necessary to stop the spread of a virus.
60,27,"Vaccines are not a health issue, they are health problems. That's why we should be protected in school."
60,42,This was a joke. But you can't just make jokes about the ACA. Unless you're a doctor.
60,57,"I don't think they even care. They think the ACA does nothing, or they are going to do anything about it, and this is why the ACA is being repealed."

68,60,> The president is not at fault for the AIDS problem.
78,60,"It's not a joke that's a joke, it's a prank."
88,60,I'm not a big fan of the CDC but I want to know why people would feel bad about something that they are doing and why they are threatening to do that. I don't want to get a good vaccination so they are willing to pay me to have it and I would do it.
90,60,I think that the movie is a good example of the ACA.
60,4,"[NAME] says that a ""dick masked in a suit, but I can't afford to take the same risks."""
60,14,You know that a CDC official said that they are just not aware of the dangers of having a virus.

60,42,"You don't like sexist jokes, you don't like the actual a joke."

65,60,"That sounds like a bad joke. The CDC isn't involved in making healthcare, but they are in charge of making healthcare."
68,60,"In the context of your post, you spelled the word'sexist' wrong."
78,60,"So, I'd say the whole ACA is a joke because it addresses the problem of HIV/AIDS. That's pretty much the whole point of the ACA."
88,60,A lot of people are upset that the CDC is going to go to the CDC to fight for a vaccine because the people who are being vaccinated will be the ones that actually have to get vaccines.
90,60,"The whole ACA is an outrageous prank, and while it's not intended to be a prank, it does include all of the same shit that is being attributed to the Obama administration."

60,42,"That is the way the 'dick masked in a suit' a prank, is called a prank. It's a prank if it's intended to address the problem of HIV/AIDS and isn't intended to address the issue."
60,57,"“A mask isn’t necessary to stop the spread of a virus,” explains why it’s used by students. Whether it’s a joke or not, it’s just a joke and not a joke."

90,60,>The whole thing seems to be blaming the 'police and people having no interest in what that means.
60,4,This guy needs to cut all ties to the government.
60,14,CANNOTANSWER: Vaccines are not necessary to stop a virus. They are not necessary to stop the spread of a virus. The fact that someone has HIV or any reversible disease is a rip off of the actual facts.
60,27,"The joke is not about vaccines. It is about the government and it is about the public health. If you want to be a joke, the joke has to be the people who are complaining about the ACA."
60,42,I'd think the ACA would be good if it did. The AIDS crisis would only happen if the people who wanted to fight it get a bigger dose of it. It would not have been a joke if people who were not at fault and didn't need to fight it would be a joke.
60,57,"Vaccines are not a prank, just a joke. The ACA is a joke, as the president and Congress seem to believe. It's a joke."
