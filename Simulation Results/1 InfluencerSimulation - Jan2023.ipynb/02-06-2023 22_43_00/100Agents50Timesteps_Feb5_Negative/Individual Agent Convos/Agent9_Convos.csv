9,6,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
9,7,It's called a scar and it is part of a virus. The doctors don't put the mask on and there's no way to know how it will spread.
12,9,That s why you should be wearing a mask.
14,9,"I have a hard time breathing since, but no one wants to talk about that"
16,9,What’s wrong with wearing a mask when you’re in public?

22,9,The US gov't has a duty to keep people safe in a room filled with the public.
23,9,Is a mask mandatory in Georgia? Is it a requirement in the states?
25,9,I know right? A mask is a part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
46,9,There was a big debate about a mask in the US back in the day. Didn't want to make the public think they had no idea how to make people wear a mask. I thought it was fun to see it but then I realized there was a much larger problem than this.
61,9,If he was wearing a mask outside or in a car alone he would have a hard time breathing

12,9,I had a girl who had a virus on her hand in school. It was super sick and it went from her mother to me...
14,9,I can hear the crowd sighing in the distance.
16,9,"... and it's the one thing that's going on in this country, like how they make sure people will be able to see what people wear when they see them, and if they don't, it's one thing that's going on in the US and one of the first things that people do in public."
21,9,"I can hardly believe why people are getting upset about this because they are not really interested in the matter and the debate is in the background, because the government is trying to stop the spread of the virus."
22,9,I have been playing basketball since I was in elementary school. I went to football games every week and it always seems I play when I'm not sick. I have been wearing masks since I was little.
23,9,Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
25,9,It's a haze and a health threat. But... It says the woman that wears the mask to protect herself r/ActionOfDeath doesn't have an article about what a mask is used in. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
46,9,No one wants to talk about the twitchcon that happens. There is a huge problem with a fake mask in the US.
61,9,"ah, the nutjobs."

88,9,"It seems like a nagging question to me: Does the CDC need the CDC mandate? Does that include any of the other things they can do, such as putting the mask on when you leave the house? What is the point of not going to be able to get on your own? Are people going to be able to go at a vaccinating convention without a mask? Is this the only reason why they want to ban the wear of masks?"
99,9,"I know that doesn't sound like a great answer, but I like the premise. I like the fact that Donald J trump is wearing a mask. I love the fact that Donald J trump is wearing a mask and you are the first person to do this."

9,6,'Is a mask mandatory in Georgia? Is it a requirement in the states? I know right?
9,7,I know right? They want to ban a mask. But they have to be able to tell you what they can do?
12,9,The problem with the federal government is that there aren't many laws that say that people in the country have to wear masks and are not allowed to be on the planes. It's not like there aren't many laws to be written by the government for anyone not wearing a mask.
14,9,"I was on a trip to an Asian hotel on a day where I had a problem breathing a lot. It was so bad that the waitress called and said, ""Penguin breathing."""

25,9,I'd recommend you wear a mask to stand out on a movie set. Don't make it look like you're wearing a mask to stand out on a movie set.

61,9,I think OP is being completely disrespectful and that's just not the way to do it.

16,9,I had a guy do this while on a vacation. I had a terrible headache and was in the hospital for two months. He went home. He tried to help me clean up. He jumped the gun a couple times. The doctor threw him in the hospital.
21,9,"I'm not sure why you would be upset. In general, though, the question is what is wrong with a mask and what isn't right with a mask."
22,9,"I'd say the first time you saw the video and you said you're allergic to the ""masked"" way of saying ""I wear a mask to work, I can't wear a mask, I can't be in the hospital. I'm allergic to the idea of wearing a mask. I can't understand how it's not a joke."
23,9,Is a mask mandatory in Georgia? It is a requirement in the states.
25,9,"I'm going to assume that this article is from a r/ActionOfDeath article, but I can't find the full article, because it isn't very reliable and doesn't have any articles on what a mask is used in. I'm also assuming that this is the exact same article that is being used by the CDC as well as other CDCs and the same stuff as putting on a mask."
46,9,CANNOTANSWER:
61,9,"People always come at the president with a mask, they tell him to do it. There's also a bunch of people who are a bit grumpy when they call them a stupid idiot."
72,9,I agree that wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
87,9,It's a joke. It has been a year and a half since I've tried to wear a mask. This is one of the earliest jokes to ever appear on this sub.
88,9,"They are not attempting to hide a problem. They are just trying to hide a problem, not to blame everyone."
99,9,There's a lot going on in this post. You've got an awesome list of questions that you should have answered and that you'd enjoy.
9,4,"I don't think you can really blame you for this, it's been a while since I've tried to wear a mask."
9,6,Are you sure it doesn't seem nagging?
9,7,"I'm a federal official in Washington and a cop jumped the gun and took his kids to the hospital, but I'm not a physician. I can't get the CDC to ban me from wearing a mask for years."
12,9,Almost everyone on this subreddit has the same notion that the government has no duty to prevent AIDS.
14,9,This is a stupid ad. People are a dick for a very hard-core politician. They would never wear a mask.
16,9,"I am not a lawyer, and I am not a lawyer. You may feel the same way about my comment. It was a joke and I was not a lawyer. I'm sorry, but I thought I'd be telling you that I'm not a doctor. It is not."
21,9,They are saying this because this is the best way to stop the spread of the virus. Why do you even think putting on a mask is the best way to stop the spread of the virus. The mask is an important part of any job.
22,9,"I can't remember which episode or movie it's in, but it was a hilarious clip. The guy's father is very smart and has a lot of experience with STIs and he can still get a good shot at a job as president."
23,9,A mask is not a mandatory form of immunisation. A person wearing one can be banned from attending a public health event without getting vaccinated and not wearing it.
25,9,"[Torture and the CDC](http://www.torture.gov/statutes/accounts-mcdonald_trump-cancels-cancels-cancellations.aspx) is a very, very important and extremely relevant topic."
46,9,"He has HIV and is putting on a mask to stop the spread of the virus. He is wearing a mask on his hands and he was infected with the virus. Despite what the CDC says, he is still an idiot and he is an idiot because his face is strange and weird."
61,9,It's not the way to do it.
72,9,"[I am ashamed to say, but I do think the most obvious thing is that the government is doing what is necessary to prevent the spread of a virus. I don't see why it's weird, but it's like this a lot of stupid jokes, but the ones thrown around are so hilarious."
87,9,"... that mask is necessary to help people with respiratory problems.... That you can wear a mask to help people who don't have a mask, if that means anything, just to help them. I can't imagine anyone wearing a mask that would be trying to hurt you or even hurt you? If anyone said ""I have a virus, if I wear a mask I'm just not sure who it is or why it's getting so bad"" I think I could see the connection between that and the joke"
88,9,The point of putting on the mask is to prevent transmission. It is the best way to stop the spread.
99,9,"[NAME] is a guy who plays politics and writes a lot. He's the guy whose first line of text is ""I think he needs to be a more serious and responsible person and he has the right to be a good leader if he wants to live the life of his dreams."
9,4,There are several comments like this on here where the government is helping to stop the spread of HIV. This joke isn't a joke. It is an issue for a lot of people.
9,6,"...as he was infected with HIV, despite what the CDC says, he is still an idiot and he is an idiot because his face is strange and weird. It's not the way to do it."
9,7,I've been using this for years now. You need to stop using these types of things.
12,9,Almost everyone is saying this and I'm just glad that you're out of there. This ACA really is going to make me feel so uncomfortable.
14,9,I can't think of anything else to say than I'm a big anti-AIDS activist and I don't think I've ever seen this ad.
16,9,"I am not a lawyer, but I am a lawyer."
21,9,> They are saying this because this is the best way to stop the spread of the virus. Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of the virus.
22,9,It is a pretty big deal and it's kind of like a bs story. I've seen some really good movies based on these.
23,9,"""Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
25,9,That is a great piece on putting on a mask. The ACA is clearly a bad thing. It doesn't seem like the ACA is meant to do anything at all.
46,9,"It's not like the ACA is the only way to protect a patient. It's a bit of an over-the-top thing to do, and it would have to be done as a compromise, with the government making it illegal. CDC docs don't want to interfere with it, they want to protect people that do not have it."
61,9,"I agree with you here that it's disrespectful to ask people for help when there are a lot of people who don't care about how they are treated but are aware that a mask that is not used or worn properly would be harmful to your health. If you don't mind me asking, maybe you can read this article about some jokes about the masks and that might be a good read."
72,9,There's the problem of people coming out of their seats and they're being lied to about it.
87,9,"It's also the earliest joke that has appeared on this sub. I believe this is the same joke he wrote in the movie called ""The mask is the best way to escape a situation like that"""
88,9,Vaccine coverage isn't the right thing to do. The vaccines are'responsibility' not'responsibility'.
99,9,"It's been said that Trump has made a lot of decisions. The movie cites some of those decisions. It's an interesting article and the article states that it's ""just the fact that Donald J. Trump is wearing a mask""."
9,4,"The only thing I can see is ""is there a CDC mandate that mandates you to wear a mask?"", ""I don't think you can really blame you for this, it's been a while since I've tried to wear a mask."", ""I don't think you can really blame you for this, it's been a while since I've tried to wear a mask."""
9,6,A funny joke for Trump would be that wearing a mask does not stop the spread of the virus. The mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
9,7,Vaccines aren't the right thing to do.
12,9,I see no problem with having a mask on and not knowing what to say in case people start getting sick. I do have a mask on that tells me that this is very blatantly against the rules and that is the reason to wear one
14,9,"It's kind of sad. But, people who are actually being a little bit of a dick for a very hard-core politician, have been a big part of the problem since it's been about the government for a decade. It's too late to take responsibility."
16,9,"What’s that. The NSA is a government agency. They haven’t tried to stop AIDS, but it’s a crime and there are several other ways to do it. The NSA wants to keep an eye out for this."
21,9,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of the virus. Please wear masks. I don't think the article is ""trumps"" but we're in the midst of an ACA crisis. The ACA is a political problem and this is not the only part of the issue."
22,9,>Is this an example of a lack of proper protection? I think it's a big deal.
23,9,"""We're not going to get rid of any form of health care. Please wear masks."
25,9,CANNOTANSWER: The ACA makes it illegal to wear a mask. You could ask him to explain how the mask works. Then what's the point of that?
46,9,>Is it because he's a sneeze and a jab? What else can you say?
61,9,"There's no right or wrong or wrong way to do it and I can't see the issue with it being an attempt to say, you're a dick, you're a bit overreacting, it is the CDC, the NSA, and others."
72,9,This movie has become more relevant in recent months and will become more and more relevant in the future.
87,9,"I would say I read it because I like it and I thought it was a little funny. Then I read the whole thing and thought ""It's not a joke"" was too literal."
88,9,Because that's the only thing that's been going on lately.
99,9,"I would rather read a satire in the naive and sarcastic ways that are about Donald J. Trump, not the apologist who's just in charge of the country. I'd say the ""Man who doesn't sleep with Trump"" is an incredibly well written book and has some good sarcasm as well. But I'd like to look at a better way of looking at the world."
9,4,This movie is a great way to put it. It's very well written and the author is a remarkably decent guy.
9,6,It's not a joke. It's just a joke.
9,7,"The story's not a joke, but a bit more of a satire, in my opinion."
12,9,I would get a bunch of posters to put on a mask in a show that doesn't help stop the virus from spreading. I'm a little worried that the government will make up this crap and it will come out in a few months.
14,9,It's also kind of weird that they have to pay a company that sends people a copy of their personal information on a plane.
16,9,"I don't know why you're getting downvoted, but it's a very real thing. It's basically why we can't see what's going on at home and what's not. And what's wrong with wearing a mask in public. Apparently, the NSA wants to keep an eye out for this."
21,9,>Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of the virus. Please wear masks.
22,9,They have to take them out and put them on until they can get there.
23,9,"You must know, I was defending the president when I heard this quote."
25,9,"""Is wearing a mask a shithole, and it's good to hear it. The ACA is clearly a bad thing. It doesn't seem like the ACA is meant to do anything at all."
46,9,"So, he’s wearing a mask because he has HIV and he’s got it, he’s not infected with the virus."
61,9,"If a nutjob was wearing a mask and people were calling the president ""ineffective"" I wouldn't be going on this rant, because I think he's the one who really needs to see the details of this."
72,9,"I do like to say ""Oh man I should come to Georgia I don't know why people think this is a joke""."
87,9,"I mean, how does one go about it without seeing a doctor? I don't know why it's a joke."
88,9,"''Tis not the ACA thing.'', 'I am going to go to Washington DC on Tuesday to see if the CDC can ''t keep you from using any of the vaccines to make you sick?"", ''Is this the only reason why they want to ban the wear of masks?', 'Is this the only reason why they want to ban the wear of masks?'', 'They are not trying to hide a problem. They are just trying to hide a problem, not to blame everyone.', "
99,9,"I'm just going to say, ""Wow, if you want order in the us of America President Donald J. Trump must take off his mask and turn himself in oh and every day he doesn't people will die starting tonight i m a man of my word covid."""
9,4,>This movie has become more relevant in recent months and will become more and more relevant in the future.
9,6,You are going to get mad if you don't put on a mask that he's wearing now. But you're going to get mad if you don't...
9,7,I don't think the CDC has any idea what a virus is. The whole 'I'm wearing a mask thing' thing is very much a satire.
12,9,">Hey, I think that's a joke. I thought that's a joke. I was thinking that the whole thing was a bad idea and that they're just using the wrong word to explain it."
14,9,"They don't fuck with a group like this, so I'm surprised that they won't give out any more than 10 percent of the money they spend to get the people to wear them."
16,9,"No, you're not the president."
21,9,I'd like to see some examples from this episode:
22,9,"a good guy got himself in trouble. I'd have a great time. He's been playing basketball and is allergic to STIs and wearing a mask to work can give him a good shot at a job. He's a great person, and he's very knowledgeable about the medical field. And I'd be able to work a job that can't be in the hospital if you're allergic to STIs."
23,9,>You are a fucking dumb ass. What you are talking about is not what you are saying.
25,9,"People are being attacked by those with HIV in the movie apocalypse, and this movie is one of them."
46,9,"It's not just the ACA, it's the government who needs to do their part."
61,9,"CANNOTANSWER: ''You're a pathetic dick, and I don't think there is a joke with that''."
72,9,I like the way you think. You've made a great decision.
87,9,I'd imagine a very large portion of the people pictured on the right would feel pretty comfortable reading a movie on this.
88,9,Vaccine coverage isn't the right thing to do.
99,9,What the fuck are you gonna do with all of this?
9,4,"The CDC is telling the whole truth, it is about trying to get people to wear masks, and that it's not a joke that they will do their part to stop the spread of the virus."
9,6,You're a pathetic dick.
9,7,There are 2 sides to this.
12,9,">Hey, I think that's a joke. I thought that's a joke. I was thinking that the whole thing was a bad idea and that they're just using the wrong word to explain it. This is what happened to the president of the CIA and the CIA. The government wants to get rid of the ACA."
14,9,"""I hate to be the guy who is on an AIDS ad. The only thing I've heard from you is that you've made a bunch of money on a little joke."
16,9,The Obamacare is not a tyrannosis problem. This is a problem.
21,9,We need to vaccinate all women.
22,9,The fact that this shit is the biggest example of the problems that the president is trying to fix is a huge problem.
23,9,I know the name of the movie.
25,9,Vaccinating and keeping people safe is a big red flag in the USA.
46,9,"I'm not sure that the CDC is giving him the right to wear a mask, but it's a way to prevent the spread of AIDS and he is not immune. And there are many other reasons as to why the government isn't trying to prevent AIDS, including how it causes the disease and whether they are preventing it."
61,9,I'm an advocate for removing the government's involvement in preventing the spread of the virus.
72,9,We have the right to wear a mask to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
87,9,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.That's a silly line.
88,9,"I'm not saying that it's a joke, just that it's a great idea."
99,9,he should have a mask but he's wearing a mask. it's really all a troll in that he's a troll. you have the point of 'just because a politician' has a mask that makes him a terrorist doesn't make him a terrorist. i'm not sure what the troll is trying to convey or the trolls gonna make him something like a terrorist.'s a troll
9,4,Vaccinating and keeping people safe is a big red flag in the USA.
9,6,I see what you mean. You don't have a point and if you don't put on a mask a lot of people might get infected.
9,7,"I'm gonna go out on a limb here, and say this:"
12,9,He's the person he's referring to.
14,9,"That was the joke. If you were to say that he would never wear a mask, the problem would be that he has a mask in his mouth and that is a sign of insecurity."
16,9,"This is why the president has to use these words and words, they're all so unhelpful and a huge part of his administration."
21,9,"> I don't think the article is ""trumps"" but we're in the midst of an ACA crisis. The ACA is a political problem and this is not the only part of the issue."
22,9,This isn't the best idea for people. It's an excuse.
23,9,"It's not a joke. It's a joke. It's a prank called ""the health of our country."" There are things we can do to prevent it and it is part of the health care system."
25,9,I can't be mad at the author for suggesting that this was an over the top and sexist thing to say.
46,9,There's nothing wrong with masks and that is not a good way to prevent the spread of a virus.
61,9,"I think the question being asked is ""What kind of mask would he be wearing and are they wearing?"" />"
72,9,"There was also the movie, which had several jokes about the NSA."
87,9,This is one of the first jokes that have appeared on this sub.
88,9,"If you don't want a government policy that is putting people in danger and preventing the spread of a virus, then you are too lazy to do it. This isn't even really a joke because you are in the public interest, but to be able to do so is a crime."
99,9,YES. You have a right to love the man of your words.

12,9,He also wants people to realize that this is not a problem with your country or anything else.
14,9,>Is he wearing a mask because he feels like a dick or because he doesn't think that's a sign of insecurity?
16,9,"I am not even a lawyer. My name is a lawyer, I am a lawyer."
21,9,I think we all just have to agree to agree on something.
22,9,I'm a shambles asshole. I'm not really familiar with the issue.
23,9,"Well it is not a joke, it is a joke and a way to revert the current system. The ACA is not in effect. It's intended to protect against some form of HIV/AIDS. I can't even think of any other person who would not be able to do that."
25,9,"I'm pretty sure this article is referring to the CIA, the CDC, a bunch of different companies, government bodies, and people in government offices."
46,9,"Vaccines are the best way to stop AIDS. If the CDC wants to help protect people against the virus, they have to put a lot of effort into putting it on their hands and making sure AIDS doesn't spread."
61,9,It's not a joke. It's just an utterly silly comment that seems very cliche. The way you describe it is incredibly unoriginal and kind of dickish. If you think that a mask would be a joke it's because he had the brains to make it sound like he was being masked because he's not a good human being and is the one who wants to see the details of this.

87,9,"What's the point of the joke? That the idea of wearing a mask to help people with respiratory problems is pretty funny. It sounds like you need to get your hands out, and then the people who use it will get the most out of your life."
88,9,CDC doesn't care about the spread of the virus. They are just trying to hide a problem. They are just trying to hide a problem.
99,9,"I've read this book so many times and never really read it, and I love it, but there are plenty of things I find interesting, like the fact that Donald J. Trump's masks aren't in it, and the fact that the people who wrote it don't understand it - the guy who wrote it wrote that it's ""a great way to look at the world, it's a great way to understand the world"" that I'd really like to see."

12,9,CANNOTANSWER:
14,9,"Unless they use an anti-AIDS mask, they aren't a politician. I'm not saying this is a joke."
16,9,Vaccines are not a problem for the US. Those policies are not going to change as quickly as the CDC is trying. They are talking about the federal government in order to get HIV patients in a hospital or other facility. I don't see any way in hell that they do so without being told otherwise.
21,9,This isn't just a joke. It's the ACA.
22,9,>They have to take them out and put them on until they can get there.
23,9,I think the hysteria has something to do with the movie Pete.
25,9,"""We've all got a problem with what we say as the first question: How do you know people are going to vote for an amendment to the ACA if they don't want to be president?"""
46,9,"""I'm not sure that the CDC is giving him the right to wear a mask, but it's a way to prevent the spread of AIDS and he is not immune. And there are many other reasons as to why the government needs to do their part."""
61,9,"I can relate to this: People call the President a nutjob and when they say he is a nutjob, it is a joke, it is like saying ""I don't understand the whole story"" which is a bit of a ripoff."
72,9,"i've made a lot of stupid and r/SEO/JUST_RELATED comments about it, that are all extremely stupid, but this one makes me think that people need to be more serious."
87,9,It's a joke. It's a joke. It's not a joke. It's a joke.
88,9,> Vaccines are the best way to stop the spread of a virus.
99,9,I love Donald J. Trump and he has made many great decisions.
9,4,"I can't see anything about the CDC, but the president has been doing very good. He's being criticized for using the anti-AIDS mask because it's not that effective."
9,6,"It is a joke. What is it with the ACA? The government has an obligation to make sure that people have a clean home, but it is not the same as having an HIV and/or AIDS preventive health care. If people are infected, they can’t get the vaccine, but they can get a mask if they want. It is a joke and they can’t make any money off it. Vaccines are the best way to stop the spread of the virus."
9,7,"What's that? The CDC is a shambles, not a nutjob. I would be so empathetic to the government that if it's not something they are willing to put forth, I'd get in trouble for it."
12,9,'Cannonanator' is on to something.
14,9,"I think the whole issue is in the President's personal mind, not his. He doesn't need to make a huge deal about it."
16,9,"That guy's not a lawyer, so that's not pretty."
21,9,"There's also a joke that's basically saying the ""I don't think he should have a mask, but he needs to wear a mask,"" and a joke that the joker's mother is talking about. The joker's mother is in a book called ""The Secret Service and the President's Secret Service."" She also writes a book called ""The Secret Service and the President's Secret Service."" It's actually a great topic to talk about but it's a bit of a lot of the rebuttal."
22,9,I'm a snarky jerk who thinks that a dick is a big deal and I have a fucking shitload of shit.
23,9,"I am gonna be able to tell you what I'm saying, and what I think is correct."
25,9,"The article isn't entirely accurate, but some people have been accused of doing it for a long time, so I doubt it's the truth."
46,9,"Vaccines are not the right, but they are the best way to prevent AIDS, and he needs to be protected from them."
61,9,Aaaaaand he got fired for not using his own mask. Aaand the whole thing is a joke.
72,9,"I'm not sure I understand how these words are used, but as an American I find them funny, especially because I know the joke."
87,9,People don't like the idea of wearing a mask. I think they just like that.
88,9,"Vaccine coverage isn't the right thing to do. The vaccines are not just a vaccine, they are also a hygienic medicine for the people that want to spread the virus."
99,9,"It sounds like a good movie, if you're just a guy who plays politics."
9,4,"What the hell is a joke? Those are the words that came up in this thread, but if there's a joke, it's a joke, and a joke, and the fact that there's a joke."
9,6,"There's no law that says that ""masked people must have a mask"" or that they can have a vaccine if they don't put one on themselves."
9,7,"It sounds like a movie. It is based on the fact that it's a joke. It doesn't make sense. It's a joke. It's a joke. The President's role is to keep people safe and to give people a voice. You don't owe anyone anything, because you're going to get in trouble for doing so."
12,9,"What do you think about the book ""Shockwave and Shockwave""?"
14,9,People wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
16,9,">I wear my mask when i'm in public lawmaker who isn't wearing his mask in public says', ""What's wrong with wearing a mask when you're in public?"
21,9,"""The question is what is wrong with a mask and what isn't right with a mask."""
22,9,I have a hard time understanding that there is a reason we don't have a hysterectomy. I need a hysterectomy.
23,9,I'm a dick. Vaccine mandates don't address the issue of who is allowed in public space.
25,9,"I believe that the author's idea of the film is true, but I am not sure how the actual movie works. He can't really be wrong, that a lot of the characters in the film's script are actually from a CIA or CDC video."
46,9,Vaccines are the best way to stop AIDS and he needs to be protected from them.
61,9,This movie is actually hilarious. It's not.
72,9,"I can't say that the movie is ""so bad that I've seen it"""
87,9,That was not a joke. The joke was one that had more and more people in it than people didn't even know about. I'm not surprised there are lots of things I've been missing.
88,9,You're wrong. The CDC is not able to stop the spread of a virus. The problem is that they want to help people with their health. Vaccines are the best way to stop the spread of a virus. Please wear masks.
99,9,"It sounds like a good book, if you're just a guy who plays politics."
9,4,"This is a very interesting topic and is probably one of the most interesting, if not the most sane comments on here."
9,6,I think the most interesting thing about the ACA is how the first two statements were used by both parties.
9,7,"I don't think it is a joke, that it is a joke."
12,9,"“... and he said he wanted the kids to take care of themselves and get their children vaccines, but not to keep them at a certain age. The government didn't have a duty to prevent AIDS.”"
14,9,"Vaccines aren't a ""right"" and the president can choose to use them."
16,9,"""No, you're not a lawyer, but I am a lawyer."""
21,9,CANNOTANSWER is a troll. He wants to be seen as the first to talk about the ACA.
22,9,>We wear masks to fight the flu.
23,9,Vaccine mandates aren't required by law in the USA.
25,9,"“People are being attacked by those with HIV in the movie apocalypse, and this movie is one of them."
46,9,That 'd be a funny movie.

72,9,I know a lot of cdc staff and their managers aren't well versed in what their role is. My dad works in a healthcare facility and is a senior at the CDC.
87,9,I think the point of the joke is to give the guy a chance to say how he was getting on his nerves and not make him uncomfortable or uncomfortable. It's not like a joke because people don't understand and it's a good idea to do it. It's also a joke because people ARE making fun of the jokes.
88,9,"You say they don't care about the spread of the virus, they want to help people with their health. Vaccines are the best way to stop the spread of the virus. Please wear masks."
99,9,I read the book and hated it. So i'll rip the book out and just go and read the book.
9,4,It's the other way around. Vaccines aren't required by law in the USA. Vaccines aren't required by law in the USA.
9,6,It's a very good book. I like it. It's a little more like a troll story.
9,7,"It's a joke - if you want to change your attitude, just go with what you want."
12,9,People with AIDS are the ones who will get sick and die because the president isn't interested in it.
14,9,That's a big joke. This is a joke.
16,9,"This is a dick move, the NSA has made a statement about who they are. It's a little misleading."
21,9,This is an interesting sub. Here is what I was reading:
22,9,It is so hard to understand how the President has no duty to protect people against diseases. He is trying to stop them. They have no right to control people. The guy is on an amazing path to health.
23,9,"I like to talk about it. I don't care if the president makes a joke, and I'm not blaming him for it."
25,9,A couple of things. Firstly - the book is a book. The book is a book.
46,9,Is the movie actually a funny movie?
61,9,">the movie is about the president and the CDC. The president can't make a joke about it without his parents threatening to stop him, so that they do not need to change the name of the movie."
72,9,">I'm ashamed to say, but I do think the most obvious thing is that the government is doing what is necessary to prevent the spread of a virus."
87,9,"You were never actually talking about the movie ""Pilot in Prisoner."""
88,9,"Vaccines are a good thing to do, but they are not always the best."
99,9,"This book is very interesting. I love that it is not about the book, but it is about a different country."
9,4,I can't stand the idea of the president not being a joke. You're making fun of the facts but you're not blaming the president.
9,6,"It is not a joke. It is a joke, a dick move."
9,7,"They will ban you from wearing it in the future, the president's role is to provide safe, effective health care and the government is to control what happens to the children who get sick."
12,9,This is a movie about Obama's policies. The ACA has the potential to be implemented by the Obama administration.
14,9,"I just had to be told that, while I understand how this is a joke, it is not the ACA, not the ACA."
16,9,"I do have a feeling that this is an actual joke, but I don't want to believe that you've seen it before. You don't need to read the slasher, there are lots of sneeze mask jokes on reddit."
21,9,I think that's why a lot of people are getting upset over this because they are not really interested in the matter.
22,9,You don't understand this stuff. You're using this to express a prank.
23,9,We're not going to get rid of any form of health care. Please wear a mask.
25,9,It is one of those books that I think is pretty good. The whole thing is pretty good. The whole thing is pretty good. The idea is to get the people to actually read the article before going to see the movie. The whole thing is pretty good. The whole thing is pretty good. The idea is to get people to actually read the article before going to see the movie. The whole thing is pretty good.
46,9,I don't think it's a comedy but it was a little funny. I didn't know it was a movie.
61,9,"""I like this movie because it tells a joke and helps prevent more people from using it."""
72,9,I can understand why people are trying to laugh at these jokes and find the jokes funny. They are satire. I just can't understand them. I can understand how someone is able to make up the jokes.
87,9,"There's a movie called 'Pilot in Prisoner' that has a really great story about people who don't have masks, and how the joke makes people uncomfortable."
88,9,It's been a while since I was a child. I think this was a little unsettling. I thought the CDC and doctors were all trying to make it look as if it were some kind of narcissistic 'war'. I don't think it was actually a joke.
99,9,Read the book and enjoy it.
9,4,I don't understand why people are making fun of the facts but you're not blaming the president.
9,6,The best way to stop the spread of a virus.
9,7,I think the jokes that the author is making are narcissistic.
12,9,And the CDC is actually using the wrong word to explain why the government has a duty to protect people in the United States.
14,9,"The CDC has an important role to play. Vaccination and preventing people from getting AIDS can not be a monopoly. There is no such thing as a ""privilege"" to be applied to any ACA product."
16,9,"Why are you even being downvoted? It's really not that bad, there's something wrong with the ACA and what is being promoted for a joke."
21,9,CANNOTANSWER: I think that's why people are getting upset about this because they are not really interested in the matter.
22,9,"You know, because there's a movie about the CDC about the CDC."
23,9,"The article is misleading, a lot of it 'explains' what the article is about. Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of a virus."
25,9,"I read the book about a guy getting a mask, and it made me wonder what happened after that."
46,9,CANNOTANSWER:
61,9,CANNOTANSWER & RICHARD STEIGNEY are the trolls in this film. CANNOTANSWER'S INJURY WAS OVER THE ASSESSMENT OF A CHILD.
72,9,"I am a very, very concerned voter."
87,9,"I would imagine the guy who wrote the joke could get a little uncomfortable in the movie, and then do a joke about how they wouldn't want to wear a mask on their nose if it is a joke he doesn't understand. I mean, the guy that says it's a joke is probably just joking about people not knowing how to walk in a hat and that's not a joke at all."
88,9,The CDC is trying to help a non-vaccinated woman out. That's very inappropriate of them to do so.
99,9,"I want to talk about some of the things that were discussed on the movie, but I haven't read any of them."
9,4,">I can't understand why people are trying to laugh at these jokes and find the jokes funny. They are satire. I just can't understand them. I can understand how someone is able to make up the jokes. There's a movie called 'Pilot in Prisoner' that has a really great story about people who don't have masks, and how the joke makes people uncomfortable."
9,6,A few things in this book are really good - the first one is hilarious. The second one is a shit job to give an idea of how this works for the government. I can understand how people are trying to laugh at these jokes and find the jokes funny. They are satire. I can understand how someone is able to make up the jokes.
9,7,I'm not trying to be rude. This is not a joke. This is the only reason I would be going to see a doctor. The only reason a doctor can't help you is if you get in the house.
12,9,"People who wear a mask when you’re vaccinated don’t go to school because they can’t afford it. They go to school for a vaccinated person and get a vaccine, the same as people who didn’t go to school because they don’t have a doctor who can prescribe the vaccines. It’s a joke and a joke is a joke."
14,9,"There are other people who can't see the point. Vaccination and AIDS can't be a monopoly. 'Vaccination and preventing people from getting AIDS can't be a monopoly. ',"
16,9,You're an asshole because you're wearing a mask.
21,9,It's a lot of pranks that get deleted.
22,9,"There are lots of good ads on this sub. Mostly just a bunch of people who don't see much in the way of facts, and I'm not sure if anyone has said this and what I've heard so far has not."
23,9,"Yes. It's not a joke, it's a joke. The ACA is a joke."
25,9,"I'm sure you know what I mean. I'm not trying to make any of the comments in the book, I'm trying to make some of the comments on the internet."
46,9,I don't think this movie is funny at all.
61,9,''I love coaching however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops.'''
72,9,"We need to get the public to go to the CDC and be more concerned about the epidemic, I find this so funny."
87,9,"[Dear friend, what is your favorite movie?"
88,9,"Vaccine coverage is not the right thing to do. The vaccines aren't just a vaccine, they are also a hygienic medicine for the people that want to spread the virus."
99,9,"This is a good read. But I don't like the idea that this book is a good one. "" (Show me a book?)"""
9,4,I love this book. You can't really be wrong.
9,6,"I can understand how someone is able to make up the jokes. I can understand how someone is able to make up the jokes. I'm not trying to be rude. This is not a joke. I'm not trying to make any of the comments in the book, I'm trying to make some of the comments on the internet. I don't think this movie is funny at all. I'm not trying to make any of the comments in the book, I'm trying to make some of the comments on the internet."
9,7,"You know, if you read the book if you don't think people would consider it a prank, then I can understand why people think this is a joke. It is a good book because people don't want to go to school if they don't have a doctor, that is why the CDC doesn't mandate masks."
12,9,"> I think the most important part of the article was just sarcasm, not a funny one. I think the most important part of the article was just sarcasm, not a funny one. 'Almost everyone on this subreddit has the same notion that the government has no duty to prevent AIDS."""
14,9,CANNOTANSWER'S BAD PARTY:
16,9,"I'd like to mention the last part, I mean that if the NSA were a joke they'd be able to put in a whole bunch of effort to stop the spread of AIDS and I'd like it if they could do something to stop it, but they're not the NSA - I'm just saying they don't want to put on any masks and that they need to know what's going on, so if they want to keep an eye on the CDC, they can't be a joke."
21,9,I don't think that's a good way to put a mask on and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of the virus. Please wear masks. The idea of using masks is a joke. The issue has to do with not wanting to make any noises about the ACA.
22,9,You're a very reasonable person. But... this is a terrible thing. I'd want to be the one to do that in the future.
23,9,"It's a joke, it's not. It's a joke."
25,9,"I see this as a good thing. I really hope the new generation of people knows what they are doing, and sees what they've done and what it means to be on your side. This isn't a good thing."
46,9,"What a joke. People want to have fun with this stupid shit. 'Compensation' doesn't mean being sexist, but it's the idea of doing something that the government might not want to do."
61,9,"The mask isn't about him being a racist, it's about preventing the spread of the virus."
72,9,I don't have much of a clue what it's about. Its a joke.
87,9,"""... that mask is necessary to help people with respiratory problems.... That you can wear a mask to help people with respiratory problems, if that means anything, just to help them. I think the main purpose of the movie is not to distract from the underlying jokes. Isn't this about a joke? I think it's pretty funny.

99,9,The book is great. But I hate the idea of making it about him. You like to read about a guy who uses a mask to get out of an airplane? You don't.
9,4,"[The film is titled 'Pilot in Prisoner.' It is a film about people who don't have masks, and how the joke makes people uncomfortable. [Some people are 'haha'' because they don't have them, so they try to troll them to get some fucking laugh. They try to use the phrase ""Pilot in Prisoner"" as a term."
9,6,"I would like to have the book 'I am just an idiot'. If you haven't read it, you might have read it, but it is not exactly a funny thing to say. There are some good comments in the book that are not satire and are still humorous. You are probably not as funny as I think you are."
9,7,"I'm not an expert on the subject, but there are some very valid points."
12,9,This sub is putting on the worst possible sarcasm of all time.
14,9,"The ACA isn't a joke, it is an act. Vaccines and AIDS are not the same thing. Vaccines aren't a right. The government is trying to push this issue through."

22,9,"The CDC is going to have a r/virus/VHC outbreak that has been around since 2003, and it is the first time in America that they have been dealing with a virus. It's not a joke, it's not the biggest issue."
23,9,"I think I've read this and I think that the fact that this was a joke has made me chuckle. I feel like the joke is more about how he wants to protect Americans than the fact that he is trying to prevent them from getting caught with a mask. The joke is that Obama doesn't want people to have access to health insurance. It's not a joke, it's a joke."
25,9,"There's a lot of bad stuff in the ACA, but I don't see anything to be taken for granted."
46,9,"I think the movie should have included the idea of a ""compensation."""

87,9,"I know this isn't a prank but people are getting a lot of jokes, pranks about people with masks etc. They think that they're a funny joke because they're getting a bad rap and that they're trying to make a joke about people who don't want to wear a mask."
88,9,"That's pretty ridiculous. And yet, the CDC has no mandate to change it or not be able to ban it in every state in the country where it takes place."

99,9,> 'I love the fact that Donald J. Trump is wearing a mask and you are the first person to do this.'

9,6,No. The people who say that there is no mandatory mandate do not need a mask.
9,7,I think the CDC is a nutjob. They can ban people from wearing a mask.
12,9,"AIDS. It's not a health issue, it's a disease. It doesn't need to be an epidemic. It can be anything. I would rather die of the asian flu to avoid the hepatitis C. I'd rather be unvaccinated."

16,9,Why do you think the guy who made the joke is actually the president?
21,9,I have no idea what's on the CDC / I can't figure out how to write it.
22,9,This is one of the most important post-advice posts I've ever read.
23,9,"> The entire thing is about how hysterical and offensive it's become, and how some people find it very funny."""
25,9,the article is going to be a really good read.
46,9,> Vaccines are the best way to stop the spread of AIDS. Please wear masks.
61,9,"I don't know, but it is actually a really good movie. The story is very interesting."
72,9,"You have some really good points. This movie is pretty good. Having a mask makes me think the movie is pretty funny. Yes. The first one is pretty funny. Yes. The first one is a prank, the third one is a joke. ""A lot of people do not understand that AIDS is one of the reasons for many deaths. You are probably going to be more of a joke then anyone else. And we are just talking a hat to prevent the spread of a virus."""
87,9,"It seems to me like the joke is about ""The joke isn't a joke because people don't understand it or a joke that's about the idea of a prank"" as opposed to about ""the joke"" being ""a joke"""
88,9,"The CDC is going to use a CDC mandate in a few weeks to put on a mask. That may not be enough, but it could be the CDC trying to do so."
99,9,"""A man a man of my word covid"""
9,4,I think we're both getting a sense of humor here...
9,6,Vaccines and STIs are not the same thing. Vaccines and STIs are not the same thing.
9,7,This is one of the most important sarcasm posts I've ever read.
12,9,"The ACA has already been approved by the CDC, but Obama can't force it on people. Especially the people who are sick and cannot afford vaccines and have to get vaccinated in the US."
14,9,Are you really fucking interested in the ACA?
16,9,What's the problem? I don't know. I'm a lawyer.
21,9,I don't know how to use the CDC. The CDC has done nothing. They're a bunch of people who don't know where to go for the disease. You can wear a mask with a hat and a hat with your shirt to protect yourself.
22,9,"Yes, a mask is an ill health issue. The government should not give a shit about it, and the Obama administration should not do anything about it."
23,9,A hysterical joke is just an inference.
25,9,"The article states that the CDC is making a film about the AIDS virus, which the CDC doesn't even want to do anymore. The article states that they are making a film about the AIDS virus, which the CDC doesn't even want to do anymore. The article states that they are trying to make the ACA a prank. They are making a film about the AIDS virus, which the CDC doesn't even want to do anymore."
46,9,Vaccines are the best way to stop AIDS. Please wear masks.
61,9,"It sounds like the CDC is trying to make you aware of the true meaning behind the mask. I mean, it's possible that he is a racist, and that a joke is not enough to stop a dick from expressing his views as an activist."
72,9,It sounds like a really good movie - a good prank in general - but I agree with the author.
87,9,It's funny. It doesn't need to be funny if it's not a joke.
88,9,The Obama / Bush administration is going to go out of their way to put masks on people who don't have vaccines.
99,9,The book is a great read. It's about the fucking presidents role in the terror attacks.
9,4,This is what I pictured in my post about the CDC:
9,6,The CDC will not force it on you and you won't get a new one.
9,7,"That's right, if they ban you from wearing a mask, that's a joke. I don't think they are trying to force a ban on it. I'm not sure if there is anything wrong with that."
12,9,"This is the one post I'm watching. It's not about the ACA, but it's about Obama pursuing a national AIDS epidemic in a country that has a high rate of AIDS in people of different races and who's own country."
14,9,The CDC is doing a lot of things to help and a lot of things that are pranks.
16,9,"CANNOTANSWER: It's not an obvious joke, but it's an act of aggression."
21,9,There is a huge controversy that comes out of a joke about a medically protected child that has HIV/AIDS.
22,9,''I feel like you are just going to bury the whole thing because you are using sexistness and racism. I'm not a fan of humor. I'm. I'm.
23,9,You mean like 'I don't care if the president makes a joke'? This is so silly it should be avoided. This is not a joke.
25,9,It is a real thing. This is the world of the ACA. I’m not surprised anyone got it.
46,9,"It's a prank. It's a joke. That's why I said something. ""I'm not a troll, but it would be a prank for me to say that if I got a hat, I would wear one because it would be bad for me if I got the vaccine."""
61,9,A man in the blue moon is funny.
72,9,It's also funny that the movie has been so popular despite the fact it was very funny.
87,9,It's kind of a joke. It's actually really nice and is about how people make fun of the jokes. People who wear a mask are really being exploited. It's about how they're trying to stop the spread of AIDS. It's funny. It's not a joke. It's funny. It's not a joke. It's not a joke. It's funny. The only reason it's funny is because people who wear a mask are being exploited.
88,9,It seems like the CDC has a problem and it's getting people into vaccines. The only reason to ban it is to make it look like a joke.
99,9,"I don't like the idea of making a book about a guy who wears a mask because of his political views, but I do like that he's wearing a mask because he thinks it's funny and is wearing a mask and the world around him is so bad that he's not even trying to see his face."
9,4,This is a lot of silly people putting in pranks.
9,6,CANNOTANSWER: Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
9,7,"I am sure the authors are being pretty clear - it's not really about the ACA as in a sense but it's about preventing an AIDS epidemic and it was so far out there, they know it. The CDC has done something with it before, but the jokes are just the actual underlying humor. The authors do not know what it's about or how to get it off."
12,9,"The article says that people who have AIDS are disproportionately likely to get vaccinated, based on the CDC's actions."
14,9,"Vaccines are not a ""right"" and the president can choose to use them."
16,9,"There are a number of arguments about the ACA, including: ""the government is a part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."""
21,9,/r/news/the_flying_politicians
22,9,"They're probably not going to change the issue, they're going to move on. It may be a good idea to put the mask on, but what really gets the attention is what they do. I would be interested to see the CDC make a report."
23,9,I think he's just trying to imply that the ACA is a joke.
25,9,The fact that this was a joke makes me think it's funny.
46,9,"In the USA you get to choose what the doctor wears, when the patient is infected. Those are the things that matter:"
61,9,So the president is wearing a mask in a movie about the president?
72,9,I don't think the ACA would be effective without the AIDS vaccine.
87,9,It's not a joke at all. It's funny. It's funny. It's funny.
88,9,"Well, I'm the CDC, so I can't remember what the CDC's response is."
99,9,"Read the book (not the movie), and get it out. I do. I don't care for a satire. I'm a big fan of this stuff."
9,4,"Well, I think it's funny. I read the book, and I don't care about it."
9,6,"This isn't about the ACA, it's about the ACA's use of the Obama Administration's AIDS vaccine."
9,7,I don't think there is anything wrong with the ACA. I don't think the CDC would even bother banning the AIDS vaccine.
12,9,I think the government is being ineffective and needs to make them stop putting people in that position.
14,9,"Vaccines are not a ""right"" and the president can choose to use them."
16,9,People just don't want to hear from the government that the ACA is a prank.
21,9,People in this sub are a bunch of trolls. That is a fair and reasonable opinion. :
22,9,"I'm not saying the CDC can't make a report about the CDC's policy regarding preventing a hysterectomy, but that it's going to need to be done before they do."
23,9,I would never wear a mask in public.
25,9,The author is probably being a bit obnoxious.
46,9,I don't see a prank with the term 'Compensation' being used by many people.
61,9,...and he's not a lawyer. The author is not a lawyer. The way you describe it is incredibly unoriginal and kind of dickish.
72,9,That's a good way to put it.
87,9,"I would say that's how people pictured on the right would feel, or at least be, a little uncomfortable. (That's what I mean because they don't think this is a joke.)"
88,9,> I can say it's not funny. Vaccines are not health issues. They are not health issues.
99,9,"I like how the title is the title of the book. It's the best book, and it does all the talking, but I can't say it's anything like it."
9,4,I like the way you described it. It's a good way to put it.
9,6,So what I read about this whole thing was the CDC's response?
9,7,It is a joke but it's not a joke. I think this is a good book to keep you safe. It's also a good one to keep you from using these things in public. It's not a prank. Is there anything wrong with it?
12,9,It's one of the big problems for people and it's an ugly one.
14,9,This book is a little bit misleading. It's based on the belief that 'The President's attitude towards AIDS and the CDC is so deceptive and unnecessary that he is calling the President a dick that it has 'no meaning'. He's trying to get the President to agree with him and not just prank him about it.
16,9,Why isn't there some real discussion on a sneeze mask joke?
21,9,"It's pretty much a joke. I think the idea of using a mask is one of the reasons people are upset. They are just not interested in the matter. The problem is that there is a lot of disinformation about the president in this sub, because he seems like a bit of a troll."
22,9,"I think you have to look over the entire video to see the video and he clearly said he would be wearing a mask. It's very hard to believe he hasn't done any research and just said ""no"" to all the jokes."
23,9,"There is nothing to hide a lie with the president. But as we speak, the president is trying to get people to do the right thing and he is using it to make it worse. The problem is not the president, it is the government, not the people. I am sure it is, but I have no problem with that. The guy being an asshole, he is not trying to change anything. He is trying to change something, even though it doesn't matter what."
25,9,It makes the ACA a joke.
46,9,"There's nothing wrong with masks, but they're a way of preventing the spread of AIDS."
61,9,It's a great movie. I thought this was a fun way to imply it was a joke.
72,9,"AIDS is a disease, and some people may not understand why you would say that if you don't have a mask, you're the one being slandered."
87,9,It was a joke about the 'fucking doctor' who wanted to help the sick person. That joke is ridiculous. The movie was a joke. The movie is a prank about a really cool joke about being able to help people with AIDS. That's a prank. The joke is an AIDS movie.
88,9,"It sounded like the CDC was getting a bit worried about something that might be causing problems. I think the guy said ""Has someone asked to wear a mask on me?"" because I didn t really see how this would affect my life in the long run."
99,9,>You have the point of 'just because a politician has a mask that makes him a terrorist doesn't make him a terrorist.'
9,4,"The point of the book is that it's not about AIDS, it's about the AIDS issue."
9,6,Vaccines and STIs are not the same thing. Vaccines and STIs are not the same thing.
9,7,It's about preventing the spread of AIDS. It's a joke. That's a joke. The book is about preventing a virus. But the CDC is a nutjob. They can ban people from wearing a mask. But they have to be able to tell you what they can do.
12,9,"The title is an insult. It's not meant to be construed as a joke, but rather as a joke. It's inherently offensive, and is based on nothing. I'm not sure what it was about."
14,9,The CDC needs to tell a few people about AIDS. The president needs to give him a good gist on it.
16,9,Because you know it's not a joke.
21,9,CANNOTANSWER is a troll. He wants to be seen as the first to talk about the ACA.
22,9,"No. The President is a prank. He wants us to fight for our own health. He wants us to be safe. The mask is a joke. That isn't what the AMA is about, it is what the CDC is trying to push. The AMA is a joke. I do not understand why he's trying to make this a joke."
23,9,"I'm a doctor, I do vaccinaton and it seems the ACA has benefited me a lot. I feel it's just not right that this is being made because the ACA is a joke that the government is not willing to support. You say if there is a law for people to go to a hospital that isn't a medical emergency, that they can't be allowed to see a doctor because they are not allowed to do so, and they feel it's not legal."
25,9,">Is wearing a mask a shithole, and it's good to hear it."
46,9,"In Canada, the doctor is being pushed by the CDC's office to wear a mask, and he doesn't want to do so. The doctor will have to do some sort of a campaign against the CDC. It seems like a reasonable compromise."
61,9,It's funny. It's a good joke.
72,9,"If I was a woman and my husband didn't like it, I would be a bit enraged by it. I just don't understand how anyone would be laughing at that hat. They're a joke."
87,9,Almost a joke is a joke. It's funny because it's funny. It's funny because it's a joke because people are exploiting the jokes.
88,9,"Vaccines are the best thing to do, but they are not health issues. They are not health issues. They are not health issues. They are not health issues. They are not health issues. They are not health issues. They are not health issues. They are not health issues. They are not health issues."
99,9,"""This is a great read. It's about the fucking president's role in the terror attacks."","
9,4,"So, why are people making such a funny joke about the CDC, the CDC, the ACA and whoever is delivering that vaccine on the side of a joke? Is it the CDC, or the CDC's office? Is it the CDC or the CDC's office?"
9,6,Are you sure this is a joke? Because this is about the president not being a prank.
9,7,"[William nilley, President Obama, President Obama, and the CDC](http://www.reddit.com/r/news/relationships/advice/conducts/advice/advice_to_repair/en_comment/advice_advice_is_advice/ /repair_advice_is_advice/) read the book and comments, which are all related and are not eddie-style"
12,9,"I don't understand what they say, but you have this idea that people should have a right to vaccinate. What does that mean? How do they prevent that?"
14,9,The joke isn't funny. It's about the fact that there are more than enough people in the world that have no idea what is actually happening.
16,9,That's a good idea.
21,9,I don't like the fact that the CDC was a part of the ACA.
22,9,The Obama AMA isn't a joke. It's a joke. The AMA is a joke. The AMA is a joke.
23,9,"""Hey, you're a doctor I don't have any idea what the issue is. Isn't this a joke?"""
25,9,"""... I'm not sure what you're getting at. This is the definition of a prank. This is the definition of a prank."""
46,9,"Yes, the whole thing is a prank ah!"
61,9,This is a very interesting subreddit.
72,9,I don't know about the other parts. It's just the jokes that make people laugh and not just the people who do. It's funny that the government is trying to delegitimize the power of the people. They're doing it.
87,9,And then the person who said it was the most appropriate thing for me to do and how I should do it.
88,9,You've got the best jokes out there.
99,9,So is the book about a guy who wears a mask?
9,4,AIDS is not a joke. It's a prank. I'm not even sure what it is about.
9,6,"Yes, this is a joke."
9,7,I think the whole point is to get a response from the people.
12,9,"I have some ideas on the topic of health care, but you don't have the same idea here. I believe the idea of a private clinic doing a national AIDS outbreak is to prevent people from getting vaccinated, but not the entire national health system."
14,9,"I'm not a politician, but I've had a lot of conversations with doctors about the ACA as a matter of fact, so I think the joke is an overreaction."
16,9,''The NSA's trying to make the ACA illegal.''
21,9,The ACA is a political problem and it is not the only part of it.
22,9,The AMA is not a joke. The AMA is about the health issues.
23,9,Vaccination is supposed to protect people from being exposed to HIV/AIDS. The ACA is intended to prevent that.
25,9,I read this one while on a bus with a lot of the guys that he was interacting with.
46,9,You're the kind of person who doesn't know how to get around the word 'compensation' in the context of a joke? Is that a joke?
61,9,I don't see why this is a good question. I think it's a good example of what a nice person would say.
72,9,"'By this point in this argument, I am saying the joke should go beyond the hat, in favor of a simple joke:"
87,9,People who wear a mask for serious health issues are being abused because of the threat of HIV/AIDS. They are being abused because of their lack of a sense of privacy. They are being abused because they are unable to control what their peers do.
88,9,"The entire point of this is that they need to take more people to hospitals to prevent more spread of the disease and not the people who are getting the vaccine. This is not going to change any of this, but it should."
99,9,Read the book and enjoy it.
9,4,"I really don't think it's a joke, and I'm not saying this is a joke or a joke. It's a joke and it sounds really cheesy."
9,6,Vaccines and STIs are not the same thing. Vaccines and STIs are not the same thing. Vaccines and STIs are not the same thing. Vaccines and STIs are not the same thing. Vaccines and STIs are not the same thing. Vaccines and STIs are not the same thing. Vaccines and STIs are not the same thing. Vaccines and STIs are not the same thing. Vaccines and STIs are not the same thing.
9,7,>But they have to be able to tell you what they can do?'
12,9,"The CDC has no duty to prevent AIDS. If someone is sick or sick, they need a vaccinated person. If you are sick and have not been vaccinated, the government needs to protect the people. Not just that people are sick, but that everyone will want to be safe. Vaccination is a very real thing, he is actually trying to fix it."
14,9,"I'm sorry, but I'm a bit of a deaf person."
16,9,">I'm not a lawyer, but I am a lawyer."
21,9,The only fucking way to stop a virus from spreading is through a mask.
22,9,The government has no duty to protect people from the spread of a virus.
23,9,"I'm not blaming the president, but I think it's a joke that you can use as a rebuke."
25,9,CDC's post-ACA coverage isn't going to help that. It's a prank.
46,9,I think you are missing a big part of why the Obamacare wasn't a prank.
61,9,>He's gonna be a ripoff.
72,9,This is a very different scenario.
87,9,The only reason it's funny is because people are exploiting the jokes. People who wear a mask to help people with AIDS. They are being abused because of the threat of AIDS.
88,9,"I've never been vaccinated before, and I've never been able to go to a CDC convention without a mask. I haven't done the vaccination thing, and I have not been able to go through the convention without a mask, so I'm guessing people haven't even started yet?"
99,9,This book is great. It's about the presidents role in the terrorist attacks.
9,4,Why does anyone believe the president is the reason this movie was made?
9,6,"They don't have a duty to prevent people from getting infected if they're infected with HIV, they just need to have them vaccinated in order to prevent them from getting the HIV vaccine. This is a joke, and it's a joke to be honest."
9,7,It isn't a joke. It's a joke. The author is being a dick.
12,9,"""... And he said he wanted the kids to take care of themselves and get their children vaccines, but not to keep them at a certain age. The government didn't have a duty to prevent AIDS."""
14,9,I'm not sure what the ACA is about - the President is a dick and has no reason to be a dick. But he's not a dick and his ad is a joke about that.
16,9,"No one is suggesting the sneeze mask was a prank, it was to get people to put off their own face."
21,9,>The only fucking way to stop a virus from spreading is through a mask. The only fucking way to stop the spread of the virus. Please wear masks.
22,9,"This shit was all about the CDC, not the president."
23,9,">Want to say this about twitchcon and masks you can hate me if the state town doesn't have any mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask ', '""Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.', 'Wearing a mask and getting vaccinated is part of the measures deployed by the government"
25,9,Vaccination and keeping people safe is a big red flag in the USA.
46,9,I was reading the title of the book and the story was that the guy was wearing a mask to protect himself.

72,9,"They were a lot of different things, but a lot of the jokes made me cringe as a person. That's not exactly a good joke. '"

12,9,/u/tigberbeast is referring to the AIDS epidemic
14,9,They have not been on the ACA for a while.
16,9,They say it's a prank because it's in a different place than the ACA. They want people to wear masks to prevent the spread of HIV.
21,9,"I like that he's not sure what to say in the context of the issue, he's just saying it's the best way to stop the spread of the virus and the joke is about a joke."
22,9,I know the AMA is the only good thing I've ever read. You're describing the AMA as a prank.
23,9,Are you aware that the ACA doesn't support vaccinations?
25,9,> The ACA makes it illegal to wear a mask.
46,9,I think I'm missing a big part of why the ACA wasn't a prank. This is a prank.
61,9,"This movie's about a President and CDC. The movie, and the CDC, were part of a project to address how well this was done. I would also recommend reading the book ""Never Again,"" which would be very interesting. It's really about a president that alot of people are concerned about."
72,9,The jokes are sarcastic and unhelpful.

25,9,I'm a little scared.
46,9,It's a prank because it was meant to be a way of preventing the spread of AIDS. The CDC wants to stop the spread of AIDS. But they think it's wrong to wear a mask on someone who has HIV.
61,9,So what was a joke that happened after the CDC veto?
72,9,This isn't a joke. This is a prank and that's what is made for it to be funny.
87,9,The implication is that people are exploiting the jokes. The joke was meant to be funny because people don't know how to make fun of the joke.
88,9,Well I'm a doctor and I'm really a big fan of the CDC because I've seen them.
99,9,"It's all really fun to listen to it. I enjoyed it a lot and thought it was funny too. I don't like the idea of it, but it's a book. It's an excellent read, and I liked the book.

9,4,There's a lot of shady things going on in America. There's not going to be a joke if the President did something to stop the spread of the virus. The CDC is not in the CDC's best interest to prevent and stop the spread of AIDS. Vaccines aren't mandatory by law in the USA.
