25,24,I ain tinker with the facts.
27,25,You need a cnn story to show how much of this topic is relevant to this thread.
31,25,I am so very surprised how many of us have never read the article. I wonder if the media thinks 'wearing a mask' is a legitimate cause of the spread of a virus?
58,25,I do not think I am a political member of the United States military.

31,25,>I don't think the idea of wearing a mask means that one can't take off his mask. It's a bit like saying that the best way to protect yourself is to let someone put on a mask in the middle of a restaraunt.

27,25,I have had my doctors say that the mask is illegal and it is the best thing to do.
31,25,My dad is in Georgia and he is allergic to HIV and the government has a mandate on his head. I remember seeing the guy's fucking face and he was in the middle of the restaraunt.

63,25,"That's one of the things that I find very funny about the government, though, but I know how it works. It's kinda like how it's a big thing to say to your son that you need a mask, i.e. ""Don't wear it because the mask doesn't work"" because it's not very obvious to the people who actually do it."
82,25,CANNOTANSWER (r-cdc): The ACA makes it illegal to wear a mask. You could ask him to explain how the mask works.

25,9,That is a great piece on putting on a mask. The ACA is clearly a bad thing. It doesn't seem like the ACA is meant to do anything at all.
25,14,I think that the ACA is a major mistake because it is a shithole and a big issue.
25,17,"A few months ago the article said in one of the citations that if the government has a mandate on the head, it is illegal. Basically, the CDC has just given it the authority to do so. I was just making a joke about it."

58,25,"... and the government isn't in charge of it, they are in charge of the problem. This isn't a joke, it's a good joke."
63,25,"I know some people who've done that, but it seems like the NSA is being spied on for doing it, and I'm not sure what to say."

89,25,"I really like this movie because it is funny, funny and explains why the government is really trying to make people sick."
90,25,Are there any examples from the movie referring to the government getting into a mask?

27,25,Is the ACA a law? The CDC will not provide protection for people without a mask?

82,25,"The idea that a mask is a useful tool to protect people against AIDS is what has been putting down the issue in the past. Probably to prevent people from getting AIDS and getting treatment, or to make the medical costs less and reduce health problems."
89,25,"I'm just like you in the movie. It was actually a joke. There was no rhyme or reason to it, just that it was a funny thing to say. I still think it's a bit ridiculous to not say it to a movie audience, as I don't like the way it's told, because it sounds like a dick joke to me."
90,25,"I'm a medical professional. My doctor had a virus. It was a common problem with people, and I believe it wasn't because it was more a result of my mask. The doctor in the movie was a good example of how to prevent it. I can't think of any other possible examples. The person wearing the mask could be doing something for the ACA. You can see a movie about the ACA and the way that a man could get an HIV infection by dressing up. Certainly the ACA is a good example. I do think it would be "

25,14,"The only problem is that the guy that said the joke was 'hey if I'm not wearing a mask when I'm not in bed, I will just put on my mask'. He isn't really saying it was an ACA joke. That's a joke."
25,17,The best way to protect the country is to not have a government.
25,24,>You could ask him to explain how the mask works. Then what's the point of that?
27,25,"I think it's crazy that there's not one person who is actually legally free to vote, and the ACA will prevent people from getting HIV if they have a mask. And I think the ACA's supposed to prevent people from getting HIV and it is illegal. And that doesn't seem to apply to him."
31,25,The problem with these cases is that a lot of the comments are sexist and inaccurate. This has nothing to do with the US ACA. The article is about a guy who slammed his post into his head. The only thing that can be done about it is to put it on.
58,25,"I'm going to call the NSA the ""Nazi machine"" for a moment and let you know that I'm not sure what that is."

82,25,"So basically, it's not really the ACA, it's the one that allows people to live in countries that have HIV — that is, that is, the only one that can't use drugs?"
89,25,"There's a lot of people who are using this as a joke, but you don't understand why they are using this as a joke. I'm going to have to see it."
90,25,"It is a great book about the people and the government helping protect the people and making the problem worse. I think it is a great movie, and I love it."
95,25,I know I do. I am not the greatest fan of the book. It does not interest me. I enjoy watching movies that are good or bad and I don't like the books. It just doesn't interest me. It's a very good movie.

90,25,What is this movie about? That is a bad example of how the government isn't attempting to change the health care system. The movie isn't about helping the people. It's about the government helping those people who are sick to be able to access basic medical care. You aren't being a sexist asshole unless you're an expert in public health.
95,25,"I love the movie, but I don't like snarky stuff."
99,25,"The whole thing is actually quite good. The movie is really funny, and the author seems to be saying a lot. You'll like it, but I'll just say something about the author and what he's said. The article is a satire on the movie and does seem to be very naive."

63,25,"I see where you're coming from. I would suggest the NSA or something like that. You could just say, I really like your movie. It's not exactly ""fake"" evidence. The NSA is able to help, but I think it isn't the ""freedom"" issue that's coming up. They can't stop people wearing the mask if they don't want to.

27,25,We've all got a problem with what we say as the first question: How do you know people are going to vote for an amendment to the ACA if they don't want to be president?
31,25,It says that the people in the video were talking about a guy who slammed his post into his head. The only thing that can be done about it is to put it on.

25,9,"The article states that the CDC is making a film about the AIDS virus, which the CDC doesn't even want to do anymore. The article states that they are making a film about the AIDS virus, which the CDC doesn't even want to do anymore. The article states that they are trying to make the ACA a prank. They are making a film about the AIDS virus, which the CDC doesn't even want to do anymore."
25,14,"Unless they make a movie about it, I don't think the ACA is a joke."
25,17,"As someone who has been in government, I can tell you it's a bit out of line: ""The CDC has no authority to do so. The ACA has no authority to do so. The CDC has no authority to do so."", ""The CDC has no authority to do so. The ACA has no authority to do so. The ACA has no authority to do so. The CDC has no authority to do so. The ACA has no authority to do so. Basically, the CDC has just given it the authority to do so. If you don't care"
25,24,a lot of people have come to accept the existence of a state government. This is a huge red flag. The fact that someone can be a troll is a red flag. There are plenty of things people can do.
27,25,I was in my 30's when I decided to change jobs because a mask is the best way to prevent the spread of HIV. This is my first time having to wear a mask as I couldn't stand the whole virus thing.
31,25,"I am so surprised how many of us have never read the article. I wonder if the media thinks 'wearing a mask' is a legitimate cause of the spread of a virus?"", ""They can't just just put it on or wear it on, it's just a way to get people to put on a helmet on a VERY small part of their face, and wear a mask on their head."", ""I think you are blown away by the idea of a movie that's a joke"""
58,25,"There is no such thing as a joke. It's only about how the government is doing things that are bad, not that they will get rid of them. It's like saying we're going to go get sick again to try and get the virus under control."
63,25,"There's a bit more than one way. If you wear a mask to help stop the spread of a virus in your community, it's going to be a bit more of a prank than it was in the film. It's basically a mockery of the fact that the NSA has done nothing wrong and that they're trying to scare the CDC into doing it."
82,25,"The ACA doesn't apply in Australia as of yet, as the government wants people to live in countries where the AIDS epidemic has spread."
89,25,This subreddit is a joke to some people. It's just an attempt to make people laugh. This is one of the most important things that I think people do in real life. It doesn't make sense to me at all.
90,25,The book and movie are terrible examples of how the government is being sexist and trying to influence the health care system.
95,25,"I read this in his voice, and it is very good advice. Apparently, the movie was meant as a prank. It has more humor in it than the book, and that is the reason it was so funny."
99,25,"This movie is about a guy who's going to be killed by terrorists. It's a very well-informed book and it's very funny and has great examples of the terrorists taking out the masks of themselves to save people from dying. I think it is pretty interesting, I would say it's interesting that he's been in a movie about a guy that's going to be killed by terrorists in the US, but it's really not very funny. I think there's some of the people he's been in on the movie, who"
101,25,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
25,1,It's also about how government wants to do good things. I'm surprised many of us have not read the article.
25,9,It is a real thing. This is the world of the ACA. I’m not surprised anyone got it.
25,14,"A prank is a joke, not a joke."
25,17,... and you know that this article - not a wiki article - is an attempt at bringing up the ACA. This is a big red flag.
25,24,"“ I am in my 30’s and I’m not a fan of the ACA. I want to be a good leader. If people don’t care about their views, I will quit voting for the ACA.”"
27,25,> I'm just going to be the first to say that I'm not sure what you're trying to say in this situation.
31,25,"What's the deal with the article? I haven't read the article, and I've never read the article. It's not exactly about the ACA. It's more about the ""no"" and ""I don't think this is a joke"". I haven't read the article and have never read it, but I find this article a bit misleading. I mean, the article is basically saying: ""We should get a bunch of jokes if we don't read this article.""  ""There's a big problem with the ACA"
58,25,"It's a joke, but it is a joke."
63,25,"""The only difference in a person's experience is their ability to think on his feet and he is not a very good player. I would suggest the NSA or something like that."""
82,25,"It was made public in Australia and the government did not want it to be passed, so they are not against it, but rather not against it."
89,25,I'm in a similar position and the guy is going to take a little of his dick on his nose and make people laugh.
90,25,"The problem with the ACA is that you are the one being pushed for the ACA. It is a huge problem with the administration. The ACA is a major issue for the health care system, and the government is trying to make it work."
95,25,"You seem very mean. I was trying to give a sarcastic response: I think OP was just being a prankster. I was being very cynical, in the sense that I don't think you were being funny at all."
99,25,i think that he needs to be a more serious and responsible person and he has the right to be a good leader if he wants to live the life of his dreams.
101,25,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
25,1,There's a big problem with it.
25,9,The fact that this was a joke makes me think it's funny.
25,14,"If the author is going to take a joke on a joke, how does that sound? The joke is in the book, and not the article, which is the joke."
25,17,"> I think it is time to do something with our society, to keep the government off the hook.', """
25,24,I'm sorry. There's a lot of information in the article. I'm not sure which one of those shit is a joke.

31,25,"[no citation], [no citation].

58,25,"It's just that the US government isn't going to let the kids do what they want without it, so the CDC wants to take a joke away from the game."
63,25,That's really sad and a little sexist. I can't imagine the world that I am living in.
82,25,Is this an opinion article that you wrote about the current health care system?
89,25,The only good prank I see on here is that I wear a mask to make a friend's dog laugh. I don't know why anyone would wear a hat.
90,25,"It doesn't sound like you're being serious. You're not, and there are a lot of pranksters and idiots and even the scumbags seem to be expressing their opinion on the topic. The only real problem with the ACA is the fact that it is trying to push the ACA through."
95,25,> I read the book and was amazed by what the sarcastic comments say.
99,25,I think the author sounded like someone that read the book.
101,25,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
25,1,It's like 'The movie is an excellent example of the government doing good things.
25,9,The author is probably being a bit obnoxious.
25,14,"It's called an ""Action against the State"". It's an attack on the gov't because the gov't wants to force gov't to do it. It's not like they want it."
25,17,"I think a lot of people have forgotten that ""the ACA is the first solution to an epidemic and this is a disaster that no one wants to deal with."""
25,24,"This article is a joke. The only joke is ""I have never read that book,"" and the actual sarcastic stuff is really just a shit about the problem."
27,25,The article is not a joke.
31,25,"I'm sorry, but I really don't have the motivation or the time to read it."
58,25,"It's not about the ACA, it's about the CDC."
63,25,"I've always found that the NSA is a very dangerous thing to put on. This is one of the things that is largely not the cause of the problem, and has been known to be quite effective. It is one of the first things that come to mind for my day-to-day life, and it was very effective in preventing the spread of AIDS. The only problem is preventing the spread of AIDS. It is very hard to stop people from doing it and is hard to stop people from doing it."
82,25,They are not being made to believe. Is it possible that the Obamacare law is not intended to be passed and does not allow the government to make health care decisions that they may not be able to get?
89,25,"It's a joke, but it's not."
90,25,"There are several comments on here about this, and the first one makes me look like I am trying to rephrase my post a little bit. I'm just going to chime in."
95,25,You were being a prankster. You are a prankster.
99,25,The book is about a guy who is going to die by terrorists in the US. It's a very well-informed book and it's very funny and has great examples of the terrorists taking out the masks of themselves to save people from dying. I love the book. The whole thing is pretty good.
101,25,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
25,1,Is it a joke?
25,9,It makes the ACA a joke.
25,14,So you're saying you're going to die in a prank?
25,17,"I think the whole idea is that the president is taking the ACA by his own aspirations, and allowing him to choose his own health, and not by the people, he's allowed to decide. He is a very active part of it, so he doesn't have to use the ACA for the sake of his own health. He's not an expert, but he has to decide how he's going to handle it and tell everyone about his hat. He will have to give up smoking and have the freedom to get rid of the ACA and the ACA"
25,24,"He didn't even read the book, it's his opinion that was irrelevant."
27,25,You should be very careful with your words. It's not racist to try to keep a prank on people.
31,25,I’ve never actually read the article. I had to.
58,25,"So a doctor can't wear a mask, he should only wear a mask when he is sick?"
63,25,I'm in a wheelchair - I can't make it. It's a thing. I've never seen a prank so I've never had a choice.
82,25,I think it's probably a good idea to be more careful of what you're saying.
89,25,The movie makes the movie sound funny and funny to me.
90,25,The title just implies that we are not 'the first person' to put a prank on the ACA.
95,25,I'm not sure what you're getting at. This is the definition of a prank. This is why you see the movie as a prank.
99,25,"I'm sorry to be rude, but I didn't say it in a way that made it seem like it was an insult or anything."
101,25,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
25,1,Is the ACA a joke? Because I am. Is this not an ACA joke?
25,9,">Is wearing a mask a shithole, and it's good to hear it."
25,14,"I mean, the joke is really good. Its a fun movie. Thats just a great one."
25,17,"I am not even saying that 'he's going to die' is a joke, 'I don't even know what he's getting at.' But a doctor must be willing to put some effort into the health care plan so that a person with HIV can get sick. He doesn't need to be sick."
25,24,You're being a prankster. 'The ACA' is not a joke.
27,25,"The article also points out that the ACA, like the movie, is actually about the ACA, a prank on the American public. And that it is a joke, not a joke."
31,25,"The article doesn't mention anything about a virus so the question is ""Why would people care about the spread of a virus?"" It is an example of how the government wants to reduce public exposure and restrict the use of helmets."
58,25,"And you know what I mean, he's just playing a dick. I mean you've never seen an epidural with a mask if you are not a doctor."
63,25,"This is a sexist remark. I don't know why people would disagree with you about it. There are a lot of other rebuttals, but that's not what the title says. I mean I see you've made this point many times and I think that a lot of people who do this do it to be pranks, but I think it's not really an effective rebuttal. It seems a little more rebuttal to your point. I don't think the truth is a prank, but it just"
82,25,"""It sounds like the author has some bias, which has a lot to do with it. But I feel the question is where are you getting it?"

90,25,I think the point of the article was to show the government's ability to slander people by having a negative word with them.
95,25,I'm going to get into the movie.
99,25,The book is pretty good. The whole thing is pretty good. The idea is to get the people to read the book before going to see the movie.
101,25,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
25,1,I think the ACA is a joke. It's not a joke at all. I'm not a big fan of this.
25,9,"""... I'm not sure what you're getting at. This is the definition of a prank. This is the definition of a prank."""
25,14,"So you think that wearing a mask is a prank, I thought the title was simply an insult?"
25,17,I think I would rather be a doctor than be an anti-vaccination prankster.
25,24,A big part of this is that people have come to accept that the government is not a good solution and are doing it to prevent the spread of the virus.
27,25,I'd say to the people that are attempting to prank on the US the first time they mention the ACA.
31,25,">'If you wear a mask outside or in your car alone your gullible and submissive not traits you want to project', 'If you wear a mask outside or in your car alone your gullible and submissive not traits you want to project', 'I’ve never actually read the article."
58,25,"The CDC is going to censor the game and take away a lot of valuable information that is not needed for ACA adherence and in some places, it is going to hurt the economy and society."
63,25,"I think the'momentum' rebuttal was very inappropriate, and I thought it was funny."
82,25,CANNOTANSWER (r-cdc) is describing a piece of information from the ACA that has been made public by the state. You could ask him to explain how the mask works.
89,25,OP is joking...
90,25,The guy in the movie is trying to convince the public that he is a prankster.
95,25,"The film is good. I like a lot of the humor and the film satire, and I like the movie and the book, but I dislike a lot of the sarcasm and sarcasm. I read a book and drew a comparison to the movie and the book but drew no comparison."
99,25,I read the book and I really loved it.
101,25,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
25,1,"The guy is trying to convince the public that he is a prankster, because they don't think it's a joke."

25,24,The ACA makes it illegal to wear a mask in the US. It is one of the most extreme and ridiculous policies of any country. It is just too big a deal.
27,25,"I don't know about all of these, but a lot of people I know who can't stand the ACA would feel that the ACA is a joke."
31,25,A lot of the comments are sexist and inaccurate. This has nothing to do with the US ACA.
58,25,It sounds like the US government is trying to stop the spread of the virus.
63,25,"I can tell you that when it comes to people wearing masks, the most people in my state don't actually wear them, so I think this would be an issue for them."
82,25,"'Masking a mask to stop the spread of AIDS is a way of trying to stop the spread of AIDS in the US and are a way of making sure it's not HIV. They know that's a problem, but they do not care if it's an anti-semitic act. People who wear masks aren't the worst but the most dangerous ones. So I’m sorry but not an expert."
89,25,"if people wear hats to make people laugh, it makes them laugh, but i think it's a joke."
90,25,The president is trying to make a new thing a prank. They've put this up as a prank and it's about the ACA. This was a prank. They are trying to push this stuff.
95,25,Then you'll be able to get a movie and a book in your head.
99,25,I read this and I don't understand what you're saying.
101,25,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
25,1,I'd say the most obvious one is the one where he goes to the doctor to see how the mask works. It's just a joke.
25,9,CDC's post-ACA coverage isn't going to help that. It's a prank.
25,14,>(a lot of people I know who can't stand the ACA.

27,25,"I can't think of any hat joke that the author has ever written on my behalf. That is blatantly racist and it is not ""common"" that a prank is so stupid it has a real meaning."
31,25,"I read an article about an ACA-related joke, and I've found it to be a pretty good read."
58,25,I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

82,25,A lot of people have come to accept the existence of a state government.

90,25,I think you're right.
95,25,">A lot of people are a little off topic, but how can you tell who's an asshole. Why did you write the quote? The guy said it's pretty funny because the movie was about a prankster, and not about an idiot who tries to stop the spread of a virus."

25,9,Vaccination and keeping people safe is a big red flag in the USA.
25,14,"It sounds like you're just an asshole. I don't think the ACA is a joke. I think the ACA is a joke, because the people who believe it aren't people."
25,17,"The CDC has no authority. That means if you want to put an apologies on the Obamacare act, you need to be able to do so, and in most cases, do so."
25,24,"I'm not sure what you mean. Is there a gif of a guy who will say this and say something like, ""He is not in the right and the person who is trying to make the decision is wrong."""
27,25,"In other words, the ACA has no legal meaning at all. They're not the reason to do it. They're the reason people want to be able to eat in public, and a way to prevent people from getting HIV is not the reason the ACA is being fucked up."

58,25,I have a couple of things in common.
63,25,"CANNOTANSWER, as well as his subreddit friends, is very vocal about his concern for a virus. He said the vaccine problem is very prevalent in the US. A CDC spokesman told him that the CDC is working with a ""medical provider"" who isn't the only one in the country that is actively preventing the spread of the disease. So, I am not sure where he is getting his point from."
82,25,CANNOTANSWER: The ACA makes it illegal to wear a mask. You could ask him to explain how the mask works.
89,25,The article says that the 'Pante to be like a baby' movie prank is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
90,25,"So, it's time to do something with our society. To keep the government off the hook."
95,25,CANNOTANSWER:
99,25,In the article I have included:
101,25,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
25,1,"I'm not sure who's getting it, but it's a great example of how government is doing good things."
25,9,> The ACA makes it illegal to wear a mask.
25,14,This is a great movie. It is an excellent read.
25,17,"CANNOTANSWER is a big, fat, narcissistic troll who is not good at stumbling onto the table with an anti-vaccination joke."
25,24,> I am a big fan of the ACA.
27,25,"It is a joke. I'm a bit confused because I can't remember the first time i wore a mask, but after reading this, it sounds like I should take a stab at it..."
31,25,"“I don’t think the idea of wearing a mask means that one can’t take off his mask,” says the piece about a guy wearing a mask in the middle of a restaraunt. “The article states that they are trying to make the ACA a joke, and not the CDC. They were putting on a mask.”"
58,25,I don't really understand the question why the NSA is a joke. The government is trying to stop AIDS spreading.
63,25,"Is it any more cynical than the CIA trying to scare people into doing it? They know it is a prank, they know its a joke. And I know that is pretty normal, idk what's sexist but when it comes to the CDC it is not the CDC and its not an official thing. It's just something to keep you on top of."
82,25,The first person comment I saw to confirm that this is the biggest issue in Australia?
89,25,"It sounds like there is more to a joke than the actual joke, but a lot of people don't understand what a prank is."
90,25,The ACA and the Obama Administration are not a single issue. They are a major problem with the healthcare system. The ACA is a major issue for the health care system.
95,25,"I can't think of a better way to start my conversation than by letting you know you liked the movie, but I don't think I want to be a prankster. I'd like to start a new conversation with you on how to prank people, unless you were trying to get your mind off of the pranks."
99,25,He's probably not a fan of the film.
101,25,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
25,1,That's an excellent read. I couldn't agree more.
25,9,"I don't think we'll get along, because I'm sure there are plenty of people who will."
25,14,The most important issue of the American government is that the CDC is not an official body. It's the best example of a government that wants to be able to prevent diseases like HIV and other diseases. That's why they made the movie a joke.
25,17,"Vaccinating and keeping people safe is a big red flag in the USA. I think it is time to do something with our society, to keep the government off the hook.'"
25,24,People are being too harsh here. It is one of the most extreme and ridiculous policies of any country. It is just too big a deal.
27,25,I think we should stop making jokes about 'the president' and the ACA.
31,25,[I think the problem with these cases is that a lot of the comments are sexist and inaccurate.

89,25,"It's a joke because the people wearing the mask don't actually know how to walk. People wear hats because they think they can walk, and it makes them laugh, but it's a joke because it makes people laugh."
90,25,The idea of wearing a mask is what's keeping people from getting the ACA.
95,25,I don't know if this is true. I think this is a really good example of what a prank is.
99,25,"I'd take your word for it. It sounds like the premise is so bad. It doesn't really sound like a good book. The book seems very good, but it tries to make things more interesting."
101,25,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
25,1,"The movie is written by one of the skeptics, and it's about Obamacare."

25,9,I'm a little scared.
25,14,"The ACA is not a joke, it's an AIDS joke."
25,17,It's a bit ironic that someone criticized Obamacare and the fact it was voted on because it would be too much to do.
25,24,It's a joke.
27,25,"I’m gonna leave you out of the discussion, unless I’m right. I thought the post was good. It’s a really fun place to be."
31,25,It seems a bit of an understatement. It's really not a joke.
58,25,This is actually the book you're reading. I'm not a doctor. I'm a professional therapist.
63,25,"""Sometimes a movie is more prank than a book. Sometime a joke comes off as a joke. Sometime a joke comes off as a joke. Sometime a joke comes off as a joke. Sometime a joke comes off as a joke."
82,25,"As of right now, you are not allowed to wear a mask. You are free to wear a mask and it is not allowed to affect the health of a person. The ACA and a lack of health insurance coverage are some examples."
89,25,Why did you take the hat off? Because that's exactly what she said. You can't stand how the people doing it are so concerned.
90,25,"It seems like everyone seems to be expressing their ideas on the ACA, not their personal experiences and experience."
95,25,The prankster in question is also a prankster.
99,25,"OP, you are not being a twat, OP, you are a twat. This is a good thing to talk about, not a bad thing."

25,9,"oh my god, I can't stand it. I know what the internet is talking about : AIDS. Vaccination is NOT a prank. They are in danger."
25,14,''I'm not saying it's a joke. I am saying it's a joke.''
25,17,There is a lot of shit about this.

31,25,There are some very good stories.
58,25,"I was reading about how a mask was made to protect people from AIDS. It's very common, and it's very relevant, especially since it's a joke about how the government is trying to protect the people from the AIDS epidemic."
63,25,Yes. No. It's a problem. It's not a joke. It's a joke. It's a problem. The NSA can do it. It's a problem. It's a problem. It's a problem. It's a problem. It's a problem. It's a problem.

101,25,Wearing masks and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the virus. Please wear masks.
25,1,i'm not a sexist asshole
25,9,Vaccination and keeping people safe is a big red flag in the USA.
25,14,"The author has stated it is the best way to prevent HIV, and the CDC is an official body."
25,17,"So I think a lot of people have forgotten about the ACA. A little ironic, but a good one. The guy who is trying to convince people that he is a prankster is not in the right and the person who is trying to make the decision is wrong."
25,24,You don't read the book. You read it by Stephen King?
27,25,It makes me pause the discussion a bit. I think that this is a little odd as I am a doctor.
31,25,"It is a joke. It seems like they are trying to convince people to snoop out for a joke. They're trying to convince people that they are not doing the right thing, and then the government is actually doing the right thing. They are trying to convince people that they are not doing the right thing, but they are trying to get people to listen to the facts."
58,25,This is so confusing! You know the word prankster is the most important person on the planet.
63,25,The NSA is really a troll. It is trying to scare people into doing it. It's a problem. It's a problem. It's a problem. It's a problem. It's a problem. It's a problem.
82,25,"The ACA is illegal in Australia and does not apply there. ""The ACA prohibits the use of drugs and prevents people from getting AIDS."""
89,25,They are trying to make a joke about a disease that has already spread in the us.
90,25,"I think the most important thing is that people realize that the ACA is not a prank, it is about changing the healthcare system."
95,25,"I don't have a clue if that's true, but I don't have a clue whether it's. I'm more interested in the fact that you were asking for it and you have said you don't want to see it."

25,1,"So I see this as a very good example of the ACA, and I see that the author of the book is a prankster."
25,9,I was able to tell you that the ACA was just a joke.
25,14,A prank isn't a joke. It's about being able to prevent a virus from spreading around the country and to give it to people that aren't in it.
25,17,"> I think it is time to do something with our society, to keep the government off the hook."
25,24,It makes me so angry that I can't even remember the name of the book.

31,25,"I am in a similar situation. I was in a medical school where there was a huge outbreak of HIV/AIDS and I felt the need to do it. I think the media misled me and it was very sad. They acted sexist and wrong, but I'm not sure what they're doing, and they're just trying to make it clear that they do not care. They're trying to have people listen to the facts. It's really a funny and interesting thing."
58,25,"I think you're pretty well informed, not that we've learned anything new."
63,25,"Yes, that's a lot."
82,25,The author is also an anti-Semite who is still opposed to ACA.
89,25,I'm a bit confused about what the joke is based on.
90,25,"No one wants to be a prankster because a prankster is a real prankster, which is the problem. That's why you have to be a fucking fool for a reason, and the gov't must be a prankster."

25,1,The movie was really good. I don't think it's too funny at all.
25,9,The movie is about a prankster getting a AIDS vaccine from a friend. The CDC is bringing it up because a doctor from a hospital has already been diagnosed with a disease called HIV/ AIDS and they have an official announcement coming up soon about this.
25,14,The book says it is a prank and is called an AIDS joke.
25,17,"It doesn't really matter whether or not the government is involved in the fight or not. There is nothing illegal about the ACA. Moreover, there is nothing illegal about the fact that it was voted on."
25,24,This isn't a joke. It is the best way to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS in a country.
27,25,I think you should write something about people's opinions.
31,25,"I was in a similar situation. I was in a medical school where there was a huge outbreak of HIV/AIDS and I felt the need to do it. I was in a similar situation. I read the article.

25,1,It’s really sad that people still want to wear masks to prevent an outbreak of AIDS and it’s a pretty obvious retaliation.
25,9,"As someone who has a history of AIDS (who's actually trying to spread the AIDS virus) and was diagnosed with HIV-like disease, the story really made me laugh and cry."
25,14,The movie was a good read.
25,17,"In the US a prankster is a dick, you need to read the wikipedia article, and the wikipedia article says they need a reason to change their stance on the matter."
25,24,This book is a little bit of an oxymoron.

82,25,That's one of the big concerns I have.
89,25,The resemblance between the hat and a hat isn't what a prank is.
90,25,I think the best solution to the problem is to cut the government's contribution to health care while keeping everyone in line to get something better. The problem is people that want to work to keep them in line and get a better treatment - people that are not in the best shape - are sick of it and need to move on with their lives because of that.

31,25,The article is about a guy who slammed his post into his head. The only thing that can be done about it is to put it on.
58,25,So the article is about the ACA and the CDC. It's about how the ACA is supposed to stop the spread of the virus. I'm talking about the one where I would be comfortable putting on my helmet if the CDC wanted to stop the spread of AIDS.
63,25,The only hs is getting an ms and then a ms and then a ms. I don't think you'll see how that makes any sense.
82,25,The whole point of the ACA is to prevent people from getting sick. It's a way of helping prevent people from getting sick.
89,25,I'm not a fan of the film because it's not funny. It's a good movie because of the way it's told.

25,24,"The problem with the ACA is that it allows people to be free to go through with their lives without having to wear a mask.

63,25,> I'm not sure what's sexist but when it comes to the CDC isn't the CDC and its not an official thing. It's just something to keep you on top of.
82,25,The issue is that Americans don't know where to get medical advice to prevent the spread of HIV and how to effectively prevent people from getting AIDS. [The ACA is not a big issue in Australia. It's just a tidbit. The people who pushed for the ACA are the ones who made it illegal.

25,24,A lot of people are ignoring the fact that a prank is a joke and don't know how to explain it. Mostly because there's a reason for it.
27,25,It is very strange that the CDC has been making a film about this shit. I am not sure why you would be so upset. It's a joke and a joke is not really a joke.

31,25,I think this whole thing isn't going to change any time soon.
