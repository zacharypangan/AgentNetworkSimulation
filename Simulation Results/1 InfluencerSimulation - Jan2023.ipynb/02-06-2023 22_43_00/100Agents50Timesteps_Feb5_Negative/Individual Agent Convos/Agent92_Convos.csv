92,8,They're just part of the measure used by the government to stop the spread of a virus.
92,18,How does a mask make his breath come out of the back of his head?
92,37,"Why don't you wear your mask if it is a health problem? The most important thing to do is to take care of your health, not your health."
92,57,We have two censorship measures:
92,59,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
92,77,That's how you make the most out of a mask.

93,92,What are they doing right now?
92,8,The best way to get the most out of a mask is to not have any health care options.
92,18,You can't tell whether a mask is actually helping with the spread of a virus.
92,37,Unless you know what this means:
92,57,You are actually referencing a recent video showing a man with a face mask.
92,59,There isn't a symphony in the US government that stops the spread of a virus. There's more to the situation.
92,77,"Well you are right, but the majority of this thread isn't going to be on reddit. It was on a discussion about censorship, not how it's affecting the economy. This was one of my big concerns when I first read it."
92,82,"When you get sick, you have to put on a mask..."
92,85,"As an Australian I am not sure that a proper mask makes a person breath or breathe, but a mask can actually help to stop the spread of a virus."
92,86,It's just one of those things that make the world a better place. The majority of people here are not going to change that.
93,92,They should be able to pick their fights.
92,8,"I don't know what your point is, but here's what I can tell you: The most important thing to do is to take care of your health, not your health."
92,18,The censorship measures are the best thing they have to do.
92,37,What a fucking hypocrite. It's like saying you have to be a scientist or a political scientist to get your fucking heads in a sailor's hat. What a fucking hypocrite.
92,57,The biggest problem I have with censorship in Australia is the health care and access to medical care. In the US there is no system to stop the spread of diseases so he can't take care of it.
92,59,"My guess is that because you're an Australian, you didn't learn that ""Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. They're just part of the measure used by the government to stop the spread of a virus."
92,77,"When a person is sick, they need to wear a mask to prevent it, and they need to get sick as well. There is a whole new way of expressing these thoughts."
92,82,IANAL. This is the most downvoted post of all time.
92,85,I am a huge fan of people who believe in masks in Australia. And I am pretty sure they've seen a lot of them. And I can't tell if you have a mask or not but I think it helps us make a better world. We are getting into some very serious situations.
92,86,">They're just part of the measure used by the government to stop the spread of a virus. Why don't you wear your mask if it is a health problem? The most important thing to do is to take care of your health, not your health."
93,92,I don't know if a doctor or hospital is specifically authorized to prevent HIV infection or whether or not the ACA is mandated by law. They should be able to pick their fights.
92,8,"Having a mask is one of the first steps to keeping your health from getting worse, and the one that has caused the most health problems in the past ten years."
92,18,I don't think the people who believe in masks are trying to change what they see about HIV.
92,37,There is a large number of countries that are doing the same thing as you. Most of the places aren't really so far away.
92,57,"I feel like I need to move to the US, and I don't think we need to change this."
92,59,The government has done little to help. I'm a very active part of the government.
92,77,"They are not supposed to prevent sick people from being able to pick up a virus if it isn't in the bloodstream of their body. You just have to take care of it. The biggest problem they have is the healthcare system. It's all about the people. And if it does help you get sick in a healthy way, you should do it. The most important thing to do is to take care of your health and health, not your health. The censorship measures are the best thing they have to do."
92,82,When I was a kid I was given this as an idea to use as a tool to prevent the spread of HIV infections by using a mask and the people here wanted it to be used to keep people from stealing it.
92,85,CANNOTANSWER: 'They're just part of the measure used by the government to stop the spread of a virus.'
92,86,People here are asking me if I have anything wrong with my mask. What is wrong with my mask? Why can't I wear a mask on myself?
93,92,As a public health expert I can say this as a hugely important fact:
92,8,I don't think you're a troll. I do not have any knowledge of what's going on here.
92,18,I would buy a hat with a mask. I'm pretty sure you're a very active part of the government.
92,37,This is true for most of the people. It seems the people are just trying to manipulate you.
92,57,There's a big difference between people with a mask and people without. I live in the US. I think it's not really an issue with the censorship but rather the fact that most people in a similar position aren't using it in any way.
92,59,"Despite their hunching over there, they've been the reason for so many HIV cases."
92,77,People here are asking me if I have anything wrong with my mask. What is wrong with my mask? Why can't I wear a mask on myself?
92,82,That's a really weird question for the people in the US who have been exposed to the virus. The same thing with HIV infections in the US: They are not supposed to stop the spread of a virus. Why don't they wear a mask to prevent it? Because you can't do it.
92,85,"""Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
92,86,IANAL. I'm a huge fan of people who believe in masks in Australia. And I'm pretty sure they've seen a lot of them.
93,92,"This is about the health care system. A person that wants to work, be forced to participate in work, etc. and then become an active member of the society, have a right to a job, not just to the government, and who should work. The only thing I really do is vote for someone who wants to work."
92,8,I'm an expert on the US healthcare system and I can tell you this: I have a huge amount of respect for a good health care system and I have a lot of respect for my fellow citizens. There's very little I can do about it.
92,18,"I want to tell you that the best way to prevent the spread of HIV is to get out a mask. It's the same thing as the one in New Zealand, because it's supposed to be something people use as a tool to prevent it."
92,37,"The first paragraph of this post is a bit vague, I think it's part of the whole thing that the government is trying to change, and the government has been trying to do so for quite some time. It's not an issue that the government is just trying to change what it sees about the HIV. The government is trying to change the health care system, not the person they censor."
92,57,A great point is that some things have an unrelated effect on the health and safety of some people. So it's not a big deal.
92,59,"IANAL. I'm a huge fan of people who believe in masks in Australia. And I'm pretty sure they've seen a lot of them. This is about the health care system.

93,92,Is the whole article titled 'We are all against vacks mandates and this is one example of a government being opportunistic?'?
92,8,You can get the right mask in Australia. The federal government will be able to implement a new system and then put you on a list. They will be able to decide what's going on in Australia.
92,18,"People are in the US and I've seen some interesting stuff about them here. I can say for the record, I can't remember what the author was talking about, but I could not remember the part about the mask."

92,77,There are a number of things that the censorship measures are not supposed to stop :
92,82,Is there anything wrong with my mask? I'm not sure what I'm doing in this situation.
92,85,I don't think we are a troll because we're a troll because we're against vacks mandates.

92,37,I don't know the source but I'm from Australia.
92,57,"The US has a bad health care system. It makes me wonder what the cost of a mask is in relation to being an active member of society. The US can be so big that you're really surprised they're such a big deal, considering how big the health care cost is."
92,59,"I don't really understand how you can be anti vacks or anti-virals if you have to work and vote alot, you don't need a mask."

92,85,"I'm against them because I think that they are trying to reduce the rate of adolescence, not prevent AIDS."
92,86,I have to have that shit right now.
93,92,"The guy is not an idiot, the whole article is about him trying to change the health care system. The president is a tyrant, the article is about the government wanting to change the health care system."
92,8,"> The guy is not an idiot, the whole article is about him trying to change the health care system. The president is a tyrant, the article is about the government wanting to change the health care system."
92,18,The American people are not against the ACA.
92,37,"I had to be on a bus for two weeks and I can't go to work now because the only place I can go is into the US for a few months, and I can't go anywhere for a month. I'm going to be doing work right now but I have to do business now."
92,57,"A lot of the censorship measures were implemented in Australia, I'm surprised there's a large population in Australia."
92,59,I don't think you understand the concept of masks.
92,77,People are looking for a more attractive way to have a safe workplace.
92,82,The mask has been removed from the system several times in the last 10 years. It's still the same in many countries.
92,85,"I can't be the only one who does this, but it is an excellent article that explains how the government is trying to change the system. This has been a lot of work for the government so the fact that he has to live with his illness and not the ACA makes him a troll."
92,86,...I don't think the US is a troll because it is not going to change the healthcare system.
93,92,"We are against them. Its not just the government, but also the healthcare system itself."

92,82,"I grew up in Canada and it was a tough time, and I have to say, in Australia it is difficult to find a health insurance. You have to go to the hospital every day or you can't go to the doctor's office every week to get a diagnosis. Then, on the other hand, when I went to school, it was difficult to find a doctor, so my opinion was that that's the one problem. It has a good chance of saving me money and helping me with a few months, but you don't have to be able to see"
92,85,"It is a shame that these things are being criticized, even in Australia."
92,86,I don't really understand that's really important' is the correct word for the phrase.
93,92,There's a lot of confusion here if it's a discussion about the fact that the Obama Administration is pushing the ACA.
92,8,"It's not a big deal, considering how big the health care cost is."
92,18,Is it true that the government is trying to make the healthcare system more convenient for people with HIV?
92,37,"What is the ACA? The fact that this was a very interesting article, is a great way to put it."
92,57,What's the deal with the tyrant?
92,59,Is it true that the US is not the only country with this kind of stuff?
92,77,People in the US aren't against the ACA. I think the US is against it.
92,82,I'm from the US and I'm talking about the US.
92,85,"I was actually going to say that in my article I said I had to be on a bus for two weeks and I couldn't go anywhere for a month, and I couldn't even go to the doctor's office because I didn't have the time to find a doctor in time for work."
92,86,"No, the guy is not an idiot, the whole article is about him trying to change the health care system."
93,92,Those are all examples of what a government is opportunistic to pass without the permission of a doctor.
92,8,"I've never read a lot of ""How to get the best out of a mask."" It's about the government trying to change the healthcare system, not about the medical system."
92,18,I think that you're describing the US and not the country.
92,37,The problem is that they are going to have to make it a problem to keep you out of the healthcare system and in some ways it will keep you out of the healthcare system.
92,57,Is it any consolation that the tyrant is an American or something?
92,59,"The fact that you can't find a doctor in time for work, and you don't have to visit the doctor is irrelevant."
92,77,We are very concerned about the ACA and that the government is invading the country. It is the worst thing to happen to us.
92,82,...and then we see these words that seem to come across as being blatantly false.
92,85,What is the word for a mask? Because we are not allowed to use it in a public place. That's a question that's incredibly irrelevant.
92,86,"As you see in other articles, it's not clear that the bill was introduced in the last Congress, it was in place when it came out."
93,92,The article that started it seems to indicate that Obama has been acting in a way that is the right one.
92,8,"[It makes me wonder what the cost of a mask is in relation to being an active member of society.

The problem is that they are going to have to make it a problem to keep you out of the healthcare system and in some ways it will keep you out of the healthcare system."
92,18,I just wanted to say that I'm an expert on the US healthcare system and I can tell you this:
92,37,"I'm so terribly sorry that your doctor was not there. If you are looking to go to the doctor, I'd ask about insurance."
92,57,"The Obamacare bill is in effect. It was adopted in October, 2005."
92,59,"No, I don't have to use a mask for health care, but you can use it in public places if you want."
92,77,It's because the person who is complaining is expressing a different viewpoint than the other comments.
92,82,"The mask is not even in use now that we've got a health care system, that we are now unable to abide by."
92,85,I think it’s really interesting that the Australian government has essentially ignored the issue.
92,86,You're probably confused here.
93,92,"There is a lot of confusion here if it's a discussion about the fact that the Obama administration is pushing the ACA without the consent of a doctor, the people who pushed for it and the President who did not have the consent of a doctor. The whole article is about the government wanting to change the health care system."
92,8,"The article isn't about Obamacare, it's about the Obamacare system. It's about the government trying to change it."
92,18,I think that the lack of a doctor is a bad thing. But I think we should focus on the 'healthy' part of things more than the health.
92,37,"The Obamacare bill is in effect. It was adopted in October, 2005. No, I don't have to use a mask for health care, but you can use it in public places if you want. It's because the person who is complaining is expressing a different viewpoint than the other comments."
92,57,I don't see a way to get a troll in Australia. The people who are making the complaints are using an unproven system that's essentially being abused.
92,59,"No, I don't have to use a mask for health care."
92,77,I thought it was interesting that a bunch of people got a piece like that. I don't even know why the shit people seem to be voicing is so irrelevant.
92,82,"Exactly this. [What is the issue here, in terms of the ACA? The mask is not even in use](http://www.hcc.gov.au/public-health-and-medicine/whatisthe-advice/hhr/fbi/fbi/a/hcc/health-care/care/soc/cm/hhb/index.html)"
92,85,There is an article about a politician who is ineffective at trying to change the health care system.
92,86,That's a great name.
93,92,"The point of the article is to bring the issue of the President and its agenda into line with the agenda of the administration - which in my opinion, has no place in the policy of the Obama administration."
92,8,There are a lot of factors that can make the issue of Obamacare. :)
92,18,You seem to think the most important thing to us as a society is to avoid a disease where it causes you to not be comfortable enough to exercise physical exertion. It's a horrible idea to say a good idea without even being aware of the situation. But it's a great idea to take the message out of the article.
92,37,"... or you could say, ""It's a tyrant. It's like saying you have to be a scientist or a political scientist to get your fucking heads in a sailor's hat. What a tyrant.""."
92,57,The article states that the government censored the coverage and access to health care as a way to save money and reduce the risk of causing diseases. It's also important to note that a lot of comments from the article are misleading and I would ask the obama administration for further explanation.
92,59,The article is not about the US health care system. The article is about the US government wanting to change the health care system.
92,77,"It's a shame that the article isn't citing the health care reform bill that was the last one, but that the Australian government wants to change the system. It's also sad that the ACA was brought in for Congress to pass despite the fact that the current administration has essentially ignored the issue."
92,82,It seems like the government is trying to get rid of the stigma of masking.
92,85,"As a US citizen, I am glad that I have to deal with this."
92,86,... I think the government is a troll because it is not going to change the health care system.
93,92,I'm sure you know that the wording in this article is very true.
92,8,I think that the 'future medicine' issue here is so much more shit than the current system. But it is far more fun to watch than the current ones.
92,18,We want to make sure the people who use this as an instrument of treatment or to prevent their children from being infected to be able to get some help or help. And it's something we can all be more concerned about.

92,77,I think this is why they want to ban the use of masks in public. I think it is because people who have no idea what they are doing are using masks.
92,82,"So the question is, is the mask what is necessary to have a cure for HIV?"
92,85,We've already seen the full story on a BBC documentary in which there's a woman claiming she is wearing a mask to stop a virus.
