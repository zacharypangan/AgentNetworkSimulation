41,19,People with masks don't really need help. Its just a law I use at home. If I don't know people with masks I can leave or I can find someone - I just know I can't - but it's still a problem.
41,24,i didn't say that i would like to be a member of any state appoint people for their community senate
41,25,So you are going to have to come to the govt and put up a ballot in the next two years to uphold a mask ordinance? Or do you just want to help people that are already in the area?
41,27,The ACA is a constitutional amendment for putting masks in the ballot.
41,29,"I had the same issue as you: I am in the middle of a battle to change my stance in the past but have been able to get a mask. I am an angry man, the mask ordinance has to be good enough for me to be able to hold it. My stance and I am currently in a shambles. I have a right to ask a question from an honest and helpful person (I know it is a small community), but it is not a good way for me to know when I inevitably come out on a positive change that would"
41,30,i have done this with the people who are in charge and i know how it goes. you gotta make your own masks

50,41,I found this in my inbox the other day.

41,12,"No, we don't. The ACA is a constitutional amendment for putting masks in the ballot."
41,18,"The California State Reps are running the election. If people are out of town, the state rep is not in town. So yeah, the California Democrats are running the election."
41,19,"yup, and i like them for it. They get their fucking heads kicked in the back and that makes me sick."
41,24,"As a Republican, I do not think that the Constitution actually states that the people with masks cannot be a member of a state senate.

41,30,Is this a thing in America? It's called the California Fair Election. Is it possible that this would be a thing in California?
41,35,"The question was - are we really allowed to do something like this without an approval process? We need to get rid of people who have used their masks to make an impact. We need to get rid of the idea that if there are no restrictions for them, they will have to be put up with them. If they aren't allowed to do it, we can't expect to get any benefit from them. So no if there are restrictions. This is why you need to ask how it is gonna be."

41,30,It sounds like he's not a racist because he's not a racist because he's a racist because it seems like you're an idiot for calling it a problem. This is a fucking bigot. He's just trying to prove that this isn't a problem. Ultimately he's doing it out of hate.
41,35,"The same way the law was written in 2009, if it could be repealed, would be ""An Amendment"" which means people need to find out what kind of mask they use."

41,2,"I know this is funny, but if the question is, is it really a legal issue to let a teen guy pick up a sleeve on a public street? Or is it a political issue that needs to be addressed. I'd say the idea is simple: let's not keep all sex drives to a street, let's have one to go if we have to and then let them choose the best option they can and will get away with. You don't have to change the sleeve in my opinion. I would go"
41,4,"We could have gotten rid of the mask ordinance without an approval process. It doesn't sound racist at all, but it definitely feels racist in the sense that it has been slammed down, but it is the one that will bring about change."
41,7,"I don't think it's ok to be in the mood to put up with a racist racist stance. You want a sex drive, you want a sex drive, you want to do something to keep your sex drive going. Then you have a sex drive. You want to have sex with your sex drive."
41,8,"When the proposed law for the ACA was repealed in 2009, it would be a state law that prohibits people from wearing masks. The current law wouldn't be slammed down without an approval process. So there's a little reason why they should not use it in a lawsuit."
41,12,This is what I'm thinking of.
41,18,It's not that racism is a problem it's that there is a problem that exists in the US.
41,19,People with masks are not racists. That's the real thing.
41,24,"This isn't about racism, it's about the lack of equality of opportunity for people, and the lack of equality for whites. That is just what I'm asking you to do. If it makes you feel any better about a person, then no."
41,25,"In all seriousness, if this were any other issue, then you are a victim of a racist, anti-Semetic, anti-constitutional, anti-asian, anti-asian, anti-racist, anti-American sentiment. I would have jumped to the conclusion that it would be racist for people to have sex with someone who does that."
41,27,"I know I've been to some of the most racist places on the planet and people in my town are all incredibly racist, but what I do have to say is, it sounds like the people in my town were not allowed to wear masks, and that is what they were allowed to wear. I had a very nice sex drive in a town where there are some of the most racist places on the planet."

Her mother was a racist, but the current law that is essentially a constitutional amendment to put in masks in the ballot isn't even as restrictive as it used to be.

41,4,What is the purpose of the law?
41,7,What's the name of the article and why?
41,8,"The article says the legislation is just a new amendment, it wasn't written in 2009 to repeal it, and it doesn't say that a government can still put restrictions on the use of masks. It's just something you have to find out in your mind, if you want to use it and if you need to change it then the law isn't a problem."
41,12,"So if you think you're not racist because you didn't know who he was, you shouldn't have been involved? Why do you think it's racist?"

41,27,"""I would be a little surprised if the law didn't change because it wasn't so controversial. IANAL. But I'm a Texan and a member of the ACA party."
41,29,The article discusses how a man with a mask is being treated as a white person by the ACA party.
41,30,It's pretty much a federal law.
41,35,The only reason a black man can put a mask on public sanity is because he isn't a black man.
50,41,I'm not being sarcastic. I'm being sarcastic. The way you phrased it made me realize that I didn't do any more research on his story and that I should probably do it again. And that is exactly why I'm trying to reassure you I've just been reading his post.

41,27,"The issue isn't about whether the ACA is a national issue, it's about how the laws are being applied to the American people and their cultural heritage."

41,30,Why should you use the word 'as a man with a mask'?
41,35,The people with a mask aren't just being racist and a problem in themselves. They are doing it as a social experiment that aims to prevent it.

41,2,Is this a nutter or a smear campaign?
41,4,It's really funny that CANNOTANSWER has come to the conclusion that the fact that the ACA is a racist one means that the current congress is a Republican Party. I think the question is whether the issue is about how the government is applied to the US and how it's making the country's people feel?
41,7,''What a fucking idiot to say.
41,8,It sounds like a lot of people don't understand what is'sexist' when it comes to how people define themselves. It's 'not just a question that needs to be addressed'. It's not really about the ACA itself.
41,12,>I'm a conservative. I'm a Texan and a member of the ACA party.

41,19,"As a Texan, I think the ACA is racist. That is the reason it's a problem."
41,24,I don't think it's racist because it's the only issue that needs to be addressed. But the ACA isn't racist because it's racist because it's not a national issue.
41,25,"So there is a problem with the ACA, you need to start with the ACA or at least take a step back from the ACA."
41,27,"The other part of the question is: ""Isn't it a big issue? It's not about whether the ACA is a national issue, it's about how the laws are being applied to the American people and their cultural heritage."

41,2,So what's the big deal? This is the reason they don't have the ability to change the laws.
41,4,"I'm not really a conservative, but a Republican."
41,7,"If you really do want to do something about that, then you need to get a job as a lawyer. If you want to try to get rid of the law, do it by the way. I don't see the need to repeal it. If not, then there is no problem. The problem isn't racism, but the issue that exists is the idea of the bill, which is a problem."
41,8,It's a good idea a little controversial to ignore and not completely sexist. Basically that is a bad idea. There is a big problem with the ACA because of the state of California.
41,12,I thought he was joking and I thought that was a bit of a joke based on the comment

41,29,It's a big issue. What does the ACA even mean by that?

41,8,Are you in California? Because I have a bunch of people in there who don't understand why people wear masks. I have had to buy one of these for a couple of years.
