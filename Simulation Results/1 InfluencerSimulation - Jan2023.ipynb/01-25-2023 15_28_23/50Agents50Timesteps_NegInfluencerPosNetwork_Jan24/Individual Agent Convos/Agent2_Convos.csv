11,2,truth is there s a lot of differing opinions and plenty of studies that say they do help the real problem is that most of the people who are anti mask are just doing it to be jackasses instead of trying to be considerate

3,2,i wonder how many times he's gotten sick and got sick. i wonder if that's something he's going to want to avoid being around people because it's a big deal
11,2,"i can't believe it was an actual post, as i don't really read it much. i read a whole book about the mask that isn't real and that i think is pretty fucked up though"
12,2,I can relate to the feeling of being a scumbag if I have to go out with you.
13,2,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
17,2,"i hate that people have to go wearing masks to keep the virus from getting in their system. that's like saying something stupid that could happen in a movie, but a lot of people aren't."

17,2,You're assuming that they aren't a good movie for the whole situation and the story is about how a woman's face mask causes someone's cock tattoo to show they aren't a good person.
25,2,"The more you look into this, the more likely it's a good idea to start looking at the pros and cons of having a mask."
31,2,"Basically, the reason for the mask mandate was because the law doesn't apply to him. It is not a law and it was actually signed by a governor in the past. So they went ahead with it."
37,2,I was a little bit confused at the beginning of this post because I sat through the entire thing and started to reread it in my head. I was able to put it in my head and think that it was a nice thing to do. My bad.
41,2,I'm from texas and this is pretty standard. We do not have to uphold the rules but we have to support the laws that we put up.

3,2,You have no idea how he is describing this situation.
11,2,oh and in all honesty I don't really think we've done anything about it. There is a lot of talk of getting a private mask because it's not worth the hassle and effort to get it.
12,2,Isn't the idea that people should wear masks if they can't afford it.
13,2,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
17,2,"i have a lot of shady friends and wear masks. I don't think I need to be a medic to wear a mask, but I want to wear a mask if i have to and I don't want to go to the doctor. i'm gonna be scared of the virus that is going to get in my system. i don't want to go outside because i have nothing to be concerned about. i want my mask to work for me and not just cause the virus to get in the way."
25,2,"OP isn't stating that wearing a mask does help, but that people should be aware that the face isn't exposed to the virus. He's saying that the virus is something people don't actually know about. IMO, a mask is just an accessory that people can put on their face."

37,2,"He's obviously using the word anti-mask to describe the type of a mask. It's the opposite of what people like to call the ""Mask protect me"". The difference is that wearing a mask doesn't prevent or prevent the virus (it's like that)."
41,2,"This is what is called a ""shame."""
42,2,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
45,2,Is there anything wrong with this?
46,2,This is not about the mask.

11,2,That is exactly how my husband got me into a relationship he got me into a contract with covid and it made me think about the situation as a whole.
12,2,This was in a Republican county. I'd be happy to see him out of the town of San Diego who lives in a conservative county in a conservative county.

I've been diagnosed with cancer twice so I've had several times because of the covid vaccine and my covid. That's because I had a covid vaccine with my dad. I can't wait for my doctor to check out."
46,2,Thats not a good idea. Thats why you get a mask that doesnt let you out of the room. Then try to get out of the room. I'd like to get a mask that doesn't let you out of the room. I just remember wearing masks in the 70s and 80s and still remember that day. What is the mask mask protecting?
3,2,> Is there any sort of way I can get a job without a mask?
11,2,"He can't get a mask while sanitizing anyone without a mask? I wouldn't call it the ""fucking worst case scenario"", just a joke. I don't know why he'd wear a mask, but he needs a mask and he needs to get a helmet and he's in need of it."
12,2,"The word ""mamma"" does not apply to this post. Unless you're talking about the ACA that is being passed, it's a state law and you can't have an amendment that makes a law not working."
13,2,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
17,2,That's a good idea. The idea is to prevent health care from being provided at a level where people do not have a proper right to complain or worry about things.

37,2,It is wrong for people to think masks are useful.
41,2,"I know this is funny, but if the question is, is it really a legal issue to let a teen guy pick up a sleeve on a public street? Or is it a political issue that needs to be addressed.

46,2,It's hard to tell if the fact that someone could be exposed to this virus because of the lack of masks does actually change the fact that people actually want to know about the virus. It just doesn't make them that able to be exposed.
3,2,It's also something that's pretty much illogical.
11,2,"The fact that your husband has not been wearing a mask or a mask while sanitizing people is a sign that it may not work in a safe environment. A mask is a means of preventing infection, and it may not necessarily be necessary, but it may not be necessary. In a private clinic or an office, it's not mandatory.

31,2,I've been through several episodes of this movie and it's so revealing that people who are more than a bit repressed and smug are a bit more apathetic than other guys. My first reaction was that I wasn't really aware of how stupid the guy was. Then I remembered the fact that the guy stayed out of his mind and got a mask in his face instead of just going to the dentist. I felt as if I was in the wrong place. I just didn't know how stupid a doctor was.
