37,2,I was a little bit confused at the beginning of this post because I sat through the entire thing and started to reread it in my head. I was able to put it in my head and think that it was a nice thing to do. My bad.
37,32,I'm sure the other comments would have been much better.
37,36,"I don't think I've ever heard anyone say this before, but a lot of people are."
38,37,You're wearing a mask and it doesn't help you.
39,37,">You don't really get the virus if you don't wear a mask. You can wear a mask on your face if you can, and if you can't, you're fine with that. I'd look him in the eye, I mean he's gotta show up to this test and you're gonna have to pull this shit Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
46,37,"I've seen the entire article - from the first time I put it on, it was a picture of a guy that's been wearing a mask for 4 years and he was wearing one for a year after that. I found it to be a little uncomfortable but I still remember the feeling when he wore a mask to protect other people he only cared about himself and was never able to tell."
49,37,I would have been sucked into it if it hadn't happened in my area i would have been sucked into it in my area.
51,37,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
37,2,"He's obviously using the word anti-mask to describe the type of a mask. It's the opposite of what people like to call the ""Mask protect me"". The difference is that wearing a mask doesn't prevent or prevent the virus (it's like that)."
37,32,"i can't see why a person who uses a mask would wear a mask in front of another person, but I can see why the person wearing a mask would think it was better to wear it while still wearing it as an actual thing."
37,36,You're wearing a mask and it doesn't help you.
38,37,i don't like the idea of a mask. I think I will take some of the same advice as you.
39,37,">You don't really get the virus if you don't wear a mask. You can wear a mask on your face if you can, and if you can't, you're fine with that."
46,37,"What was it like when it happened? Because I knew the name of my friend and he didn't want to see me wearing a mask, he was the one who started a virus. He did that because he loved her so much, she wanted her life back and he was all grown up. That guy has no clue what is going on or who is going to be on the Internet, he's been wearing masks for 4 years and I still still love him."
49,37,If you can't see his face you need to call the police.
51,37,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
37,2,"[(In this context, I'm not referencing any of the articles in this thread) I just wanted to say that a lot of people (not just people) who are anti-masking just try to keep in mind that the facts and results of this article are more reliable than some of the articles. It is misleading to say that masks do not prevent the virus, it is misleading."
37,32,"I've already said the same thing to a friend. This isn't a good idea. This is not the kind of situation I want to be in. I'd like to be in a relationship with someone who doesn't have the virus. This is not going to work, but there is a huge stigma surrounding it."
37,36,">You don't really get the virus if you don't wear a mask. You can wear a mask on your face if you can, and if you can't, you're fine with that."
38,37,Why is that the case? It would help if he were to have a job.
39,37,"I'm trying to be as nice as possible, but I think I'm gonna do what I have to do, and I'm going to do what I want, and that I'm going to do what I have to do."
46,37,"I'm gonna try the ""mask protect other people he only cares about himself"" one. That's just like saying ""What is the mask mask protecting?""."
49,37,It is very appropriate that he is going to get you to get him to give you a 'I'm late and he's got me wearing my mask everywhere and my area is spiking hard right now just signed up to get him to drive you and the wife a drive up test come saturday i was late but i gotta hand it to he s got me wearing my mask everywhere and my area is spiking hard right now just signed up to get him and the wife a drive up test
