16,3,Is there a medical reason why some people are not vaccinated?
16,4,> It is actually a good idea. I think it’s not appropriate to give it a chance or even say anything negative.
16,8,I think the best way to prevent the sick is to wear a mask.
16,11,Vaccines are for people who are more in the medical field than they are for people who have to get sick to become a septic.

26,16,No wonder it's in the headline
30,16,"It is a satire. You can make jokes about it, but it's a satire."
31,16,"I read an article about this and the CDC is denying the mandate. They do not give the mandate to people based on their experience. If they do, the mask mandate would be a bad idea if they had the experience. You can't ask the doctor for a mask if he does not have an experience in the health care field."
36,16,My wife has a right to wear a mask and I can't wear it.
44,16,They are only being used to protect people from a disease that they have no information on.
16,3,"Why can't you take this to the CDC and ask them what's a ""good idea"" to do in this situation?"
16,4,It's a joke. I'm not sure I'm even on the board on this.
16,8,The CDC says that when people are vaccinated the CDC is saying that they don't have to have a mask on them so that they are vaccinated.
16,11,A virologist needs to be trained in HIV / syphilis prevention and not masks. If the doctor cannot get a vaccine that's not a good idea.

I think you need a health - care professional that genuinely knows about the benefits and benefits to the patient. It's a big question, no matter how you define it."
30,16,CANNOTANSWER:
31,16,CANNOTANSWER. This is a very unhelpful and stupid question. It's a joke that it's meant to protect anyone. They're not meant to protect anyone. Vaccines aren't intended for people with a specific type of disease. Vaccines aren't intended to prevent a specific type of disease. Vaccines aren't intended to prevent a specific type of disease. Vaccines aren't intended to protect anybody. Vaccines aren't intended to prevent infection.

16,3,"I don't understand your question. You have no idea what you are talking about. You have no idea how you can use a mask and how to stop people from getting sick? This is a very complex problem. The reason why you don't have a mask is because your responsibilities are so clear. You don't do this and you have no information about what the CDC says, and you don't understand how it is being used in your community. Vaccines are intended to protect people from getting sick."
16,4,In a very big way:

24,16,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
26,16,I think I just found out that a joke came out about someone wearing a mask and he didn't think it was good for a jobless man. They have no reason to think it's a joke if people haven't been on the road and have no idea how to drive around there. They're telling the truth that they can't go outside without the mask on.

31,16,It's not a joke. The idea is to put people in a mask. This isn't about infecting others. This is about how to spread the virus from the government to whoever is in need.
36,16,"The problem with what. ""We don't really get the virus if you don't wear a mask."

16,4,"[Vicinaries are not meant to stop the virus, but they are used to prevent it from spreading. Vaccines are the most likely culprit."
16,8,It's not racist at all.
16,11,"The CDC has never tried to make them work. They are simply denying anyone's right to make a joke if they do. It is simply not a joke and is not going to work. Rather they have a right to make an official statement stating that they are not doing anything wrong or trying to make a joke, but it's not the right thing to do."
19,16,"CANNOTANSWER: I'm sorry you're experiencing this as well. I just think it's a shame, and I don't understand what is going on. I just think it's a joke. They are going to change its policies so that it is a joke."
24,16,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
26,16,In that scenario a person can't afford to go to a doctor or get their job. There are no other benefits for the person without a mask.
30,16,"This is not racist. This is a joke about how people can't think for themselves, and also why we don't have insurance."
31,16,"That's a really good idea. I can see that you think the idea of going to a party with the mask mandate is a joke, but I feel like this sucks, especially if you're not a conservative. You're not a fan of the CDC and you're more of a Republican."
36,16,The issue is that people feel that if they get in trouble then they're doing a better job of hiding the virus from the public.
44,16,You are an idiot. Not even once.

31,16,I think a lot of people are just misinterpreting the text. The headline seems to be misleading and I'm just being polite and honest.
36,16,>I’m in a situation where I was clinging to a mask and got into trouble.

16,3,"I'm very sure that we have some common issues. You could say something along the lines of if you didn't get a good vaccination or if you didn't need a mask because of the situation? Then again, the CDC will probably have to take a different approach if they try and use the CDC to prevent people from getting sick in any situation."
16,4,"I'm sorry this happened to you. I hope it was a joke. I don't know how to go around it. I don't think it's a joke. But if you're a doctor and you don't have a right to get a job, then yes, it is. You're a doctor is what's going to happen. I know the CDC, so it would be a little difficult to understand if they were a legal entity."

26,16,You're going to get a message. This is a good sign. I’m afraid he’s joking because he isn’t going to answer that questions.
30,16,How... How does it make you feel?
31,16,The first two parts of the article are misleading. There's no such thing as a mandate.

44,16,"It seems that a lot of the people who are on the CDC are inherently idiots and they can't be treated with a vaccine. They can't be treated with a vaccine, and that's a huge waste of money."

16,11,I was talking to a young girl who had a syphilis virus. She said that the CDC had a medical issue with it. So I guess I should just tell her a story about this so that she can continue with the conversation.
