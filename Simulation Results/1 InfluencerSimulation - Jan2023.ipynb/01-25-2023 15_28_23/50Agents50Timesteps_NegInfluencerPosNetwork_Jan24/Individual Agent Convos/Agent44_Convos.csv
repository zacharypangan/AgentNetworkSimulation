44,19,It seems like the only reason to have a mask in a person is to avoid having a fever. You can put a mask on the same day as being sick if you're sick and it will help to stop the virus.

The doctor wore a mask, because she couldn't help but think I was wearing it. That and when she started to get colds she was using the mask on my neck.

44,40,Vaccines can kill a virus but they're not infectable. They're not infectable. They're not infectable.
44,43,This is actually a good joke.
51,44,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
44,8,"It's like I'm going to tell you the exact same thing. The only thing I know I've actually ever heard was when I was young, when someone told me they wouldn't use a mask on a child. They told me not to use them because it caused a fever, and then it went back to how it used to be, because it was a septic and the CDC didn't care. The CDC gave me the symptom, and now I get that symptom. It makes me feel like I may have been a virus for years, and I"
44,11,>We aren't meant to be used for a specific type of disease. They aren't meant to be used for any specific type of disease. They aren't meant to be used for any specific type of disease.
44,15,"It's a joke, but a good joke?"
44,16,>He's not the virus.
44,19,That's the kind of thing that the CDC is going to do. They can't put any information into it. They can't say that it will help.
44,20,It's all just a sarcastic statement.
44,31,A doctor who goes to the doctor that carries the vaccines and who uses them for a particular type of disease is not going to get it.
44,40,"They aren't meant to protect the septics, but rather for those who are not infected themselves."
44,43,"I would like to point out that I don't like the word fem. I'm really sorry, I'm not a doctor. But I am not sure what the joke is about."
51,44,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
44,8,The same goes for what you've been saying.
44,11,They aren't meant to be used for a specific type of disease. They aren't meant to be used for anything specific. They aren't meant to be used for a specific type of disease. They aren't meant to be used for any specific type of disease. They aren't meant to be used for any specific type of disease. They aren't meant to be used for any specific type of disease.

44,16,>he’s not gonna let you go to a dermatologist to find out what the CDC says.
44,19,The problem with the CDC is the stigma attached to them.
44,20,"The doctor's reaction to this is very much to say something like, ""This is my favorite movie ever.''"
44,31,"So you are describing a situation of people getting infected, but you are referring to a medical condition which is a combination of infections from various types."
44,40,They are a parasite. They are not infectable. They are not infectable. They are not infectable. They are not infectable. They are not infectable. They are not infectable.
44,43,"""If you put on a mask in the bathroom, there are more spores. it's a lot easier to kill a virus than a mask. if you don't want to get infected, you can just make them off, so it's not all you can do."""
51,44,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
44,8,In my family's case they only had to put on a mask because they don't have any medical problems - I've had two cases and two minor ones so far.
44,11,"I'm gonna have to go go, wtf. Do you think you have a problem?"
44,15,I've never seen a doctor like that.
44,16,"Yes, and yes, that's an appropriate way to refer to this. I'm still trying to figure out why the CDC has to use that to justify it."
44,19,"CDC isn't saying that they're right. It's simply saying that they need to do whatever they can to get the word out to their patients, whether or not they actually want to be vaccinated."
44,20,I'm in Texas. I'm not a doctor. I don't know the CDC. I'm from Texas.
44,31,They say that a CDC-approved fungus vaccine isn't meant to be used in general as it can be used for any type of infection if that's the case. It may or may not be a very good idea for your health.
44,40,The CDC was not able to use the word septic in their medical terminology.
44,43,"I'd like to add that the most important part about my experience is that I'm not going to be able to take any other precautions. My husband told me to take a break because I didn't want to look sick for years. And it's not my fault because I'm an adult with a virus that I can't get rid of without help. It's like they don't want to see your face because it's going to hurt you, but it's not his job to keep his nose."
51,44,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
44,8,"It's so ridiculous that they put it on people, who have to think about what they should do."
44,11,A mask isn't a mask. It's a filter for infection. A filter is a mask that doesn't help with the virus. A mask works well to prevent the virus. A filter is a filter that allows for infection.

44,16,I don't think it's funny. It's the same problem as with what you have said. But you have a lot of different opinions. It doesn't seem like they were trying to educate people but that's the problem.
44,19,"Vaccines aren't going to be used for anything specifically specific to infect others. Unless they're the virus that causes the sickness and carries symptoms, a sneeze mask might be insufficient for most people unless they have some type of disease (smoker, colitis, a clone, etc.)"
44,20,Vaccines are NOT meant to be used for all kinds of things.
44,31,Vaccines don't work well as a treatment for any type of infection. They can be used as a filter for a parasite. The fact that it's not infectable and isn't infectable. They aren't infectable.

51,44,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
44,8,Vaccines aren't meant to be used for any specific purpose. They aren't meant to be used for a specific type of disease. Vaccines aren't meant to be used for a specific type of disease. They aren't meant to be used for a specific type of disease. They aren't meant to be used for any specific type of infection. They aren't meant to be used for a specific type of disease. They are not intended to be used for any specific type of infection.
44,11,"I've always been a sucker for a filter, especially when I'm talking about something that is actually more of a barrier or something, but I've always used it as a barrier. Whether or not it's meant to be used in some way is up to individual personal preferences."
44,15,It's a joke.
44,16,"> I like to think of it as a joke and a joke is a joke. I'm pretty sure this guy isn't even a doctor, just someone with a lot of experience who just doesn't get it."
44,19,"As a mother of a child with an HIV/A virus, my doctor always said - ""Well I'd do it if I wanted to but I have to take my time!"""
44,20,"I read the last sentence. So, I'm going to say ""Well, I'm going to put on a mask, but I don't have one, so that's about it."""
44,31,I don't get it. The CDC is claiming that 'every virus is not infectable' as a general word to be used in a doctor-approved form.
44,40,"The CDC should have some sort of protocol in place that allows the vaccine to be administered by a doctor. That way, if the CDC was right, they wouldn't be used to stop the virus or to try to stop it."
44,43,That's an awful joke.
51,44,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
44,8,> I'm not a funny person. You're not funny. I'm not funny.
44,11,I think this is a fucking joke.
44,15,[NAME] [NAME]](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditMaking/Content/Micro_Vaccine) (https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditMaking/Content/Micro_Vaccine) are two of the CDC's'scientific and useful suggestions' for a vaccine:
44,16,I can't imagine the point of being able to be a doctor because of the virus. But you are right: 'Vaccines are not meant to be used for a specific purpose. Vaccines aren't meant to be used for a specific type of disease. They aren't meant to be used for a specific type of disease. Vaccines aren't meant to be used for any specific type of infection. They aren't meant to be used for a specific type of infection. They aren't meant to be used for 
44,19,"I read a post about that. I read a couple of posts and said a little ""He's a septic, I've never seen a doctor. He's not going to let me go to a dermatologist to find out what the CDC says."""
44,20,"> I can’t even say the answer, I can’t get into that, because I’m not sure of the specifics of the word."
44,31,Vaccines aren't meant to be used for any specific type of infection. They aren't meant to be used for any specific type of infection.
44,40,"I am going to try a little bit. It is one of the hardest things I've ever had to go through. I've tried a ton of different things. I don't know which ones are the best. But when I get sick I do wear a mask, and it just makes me uncomfortable. I try to be so much more patient when I am sick and I need to stop it."
44,43,"“I think the CDC is being sarcastic. I’m not a doctor and I’m not sure what the joke is about. It’s not funny that they put it on people, who have to think about what they should do. A mask isn’t meant to be used for any specific type of disease. They aren’t meant to be used for a specific type of disease. They aren’t meant to be used for a specific type of disease. They aren’t meant to be used for a specific type of fungus,"
51,44,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
44,8,"What does the word ""machete"" mean?"
44,11,"I've got no idea why this guy seems so dreadful, but I think it's time to go. The CDC should have put a vaccine on this guy. That's a very long, long time ago."
44,15,There’s a lot of stuff about this called ‘everyvirus isn’t infectable’ that’s relevant. You don’t need a mask to get sick. If your mask doesn’t protect you you have to get out. Getting sick and getting infected isn’t a good idea.
44,16,You are an idiot. Not even once.
44,19,It sounds like the CDC is overestimating how many people are infected with HIV. They aren’t meant to be used for a specific type of disease. They aren’t meant to be used for a specific type of disease. They aren’t meant to be used for a specific type of disease. They aren’t meant to be used for a specific type of disease. They aren’t meant to be used for a specific type of infection. They aren’t meant to be used for a specific type of virus.
44,20,"I'm not a joke person, but I don't like being in a joke. I'm saying you are not a dick."
44,31,It’s the worst joke I’ve ever heard. I’m actually glad someone has a sense of humor.
44,40,"""Vaccines aren't meant to be used for a specific type of disease. They aren't meant to be used for a specific type of disease. They aren't meant to be used for any specific type of infection. They aren't meant to be used for a specific type of infection."
44,43,"'A lot of people don't have a good sense of humor. Why don't they go to the doctor and find the article about how the virus can cause a rash?', ""(https://www.cdc.gov/about/virginia/virginia/fraud-fem-fraud/article/agdnp-fraud/index.aspx). I’m not a doctor. I’m not a doctor. But I’m not a joke."
51,44,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
44,8,I've seen a couple of comments where this is sarcastic and it's a joke. This is a joke and a sarcastic joke.
44,11,"I'd love to have a friend of mine try a medical mask and then see if they can get you to put on a mask. I know it is a bit of a joke but if it's just a shit joke, I'm not going to wear it."
44,15,"I don't like to think that the CDC is being sarcastic. What they’re doing is a bad idea. A lot of people are putting the CDC down and making themselves feel unhygienic. But there are plenty of people who don't like to think the CDC is being sarcastic. Vaccines aren’t meant to be used for any specific purpose. They aren’t meant to be used for any specific type of disease, unless they can be used for a specific type of infection."
44,16,"This joke is so awful that it makes it nearly impossible to understand it. This is just one example of how horrible it is. If you want to see a doctor that uses vaccines, you should just do it yourself."
44,19,"I see a lot of people with HIV, it's a problem for the CDC to use masks to prevent viral infection."
44,20,"In an interview a doctor told me in the US that they will put on masks for the flu and people should go to the doctor for it. Vaccines are a vaccinated virus. They can cause spores that infect others. Vaccines can even kill a person if they get into the wrong fungus. So, the guy isn't getting it from me, and that's an extremely serious sign that the infection isn't infected."
44,31,">What I've found funny is that it’s often called a “virginitis spore” which can be contracted through a filter, a fungus or a parasite."
44,40,"I mean... in a sense, I think this is a joke, but you know what is more interesting:"
44,43,"Despite being a very well known infection, and being part of a group of friends who are also infected with HIV, he's still doing it to keep a good life and being on the edge of his seat."
51,44,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
44,8,Vaccines are not meant to be used for a specific type of disease. They are not meant to be used for a specific type of disease. They are not meant to be used for any specific type of disease. They aren't meant to be used for a specific type of disease.
44,11,"It's a joke. They're in a nutshell. A virus can get into the brain when you're out of it (in a nutshell, yes, but not really). They're not a virus but they have a spore (which isn't a virus, I would be surprised if there was a virus that was created there) and aren't meant to be used to prevent an infection. You can also put a septic on and that's when you can't take it out of it a person"
44,15,That's a really good joke.
44,16,"I think a lot of the people that are on the program are either ignorant, uninformed, and do not know what the topic is. Or just aren't aware of what it's like for the CDC."
44,19,"No way a virus can be vaccinated to prevent it. It’s also not meant to be used to fight a virus with anyone, but for treating an infection that causes the virus to be mutated if the virus is present, it’s also not meant to be used for that particular type of virus. Those are specific types of viruses. Vaccines aren’t meant to be used for a specific type of disease. They aren’t meant to be used for a specific type of virus. But it’s not the most severe case of infecting"
44,20,I'm pretty sure the CDC doesn't do this in every sense of the word. They're overestimating the number of people with the virus and they're not really concerned with the facts.
44,31,It's been said that these pseudoscientists are putting themselves in a situation where they know how much they need to be in a certain type of situation and then going to a doctor in a specific field to diagnose and treat a virus. So...
44,40,It seems to me like there is nothing wrong with shaming your friend because they 'can't wear a mask'.
44,43,"I read the headline and the article was a joke about a virus, and the guy said, ""Is there a CDC policy that says that I should wear a mask in the bathroom to stop an infection and if it goes to the next doctor?."" It is also a joke about the fact that this person's family is doing it for ""sneakers"" and that ""they are just sick"". So it makes no sense to me that he is wearing a mask, which is why I'm being a joke about a CDC policy. It'"
51,44,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
44,8,I've got no ideas about why a person should wear a mask. Is it so funny that they want you to wear a mask?
44,11,You sounded like a very smart CDC employee.
44,15,"So... I read the headline and the guy said, ""Is there a CDC policy that says that I should wear a mask in the bathroom to stop an infection and if it goes to the next doctor? "", ""I don't like to think that the CDC is being sarcastic."
44,16,I have a long list of jokes about this and I figured this was a good way to express my views.
44,19,"I know I'm on this side of the spectrum, but I think there's a bit of a disconnect with the CDC. I think the CDC is just trying to mislead people. Those who don't know anything about the CDC are the CDC. They are not putting people in an unsanitary situation that is an indication they are trying to prevent or eradicate an infection if they don't know what to do with them."
44,20,"In my opinion, there's nothing wrong with saying a joke, but in general, the CDC is a bit sarcastic. The ""Masks are not meant to be used for all kinds of things. A mask is not meant to be used for any specific purpose."""
44,31,Vaccines are a type of antiviral drug and thus not infectable. They can be used for any type of disease.
44,40,"A virus can kill a virus and then get mutated into a person. If a person has a virus and does not get the virus then they will infect someone else. A virus is a parasite, which isn’t a parasite. It’s a parasite, which isn’t a parasite. It’s not infectable."
44,43,"'If you put on a mask in the bathroom, there are more spores. it's a lot easier to kill a virus than a mask. If you don't want to get infected, you can just make them off, so it's not all you can do."""
51,44,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
44,8,"The question is, is that he or she wants a mask? I don't have one."
44,11,It's a very real question and you're in the right place to ask the right questions.
44,15,"I mean, the jokes of what they're trying to say are stupid."
44,16,"I am a dermatologist. I know that most people do. However, it does seem to me that I don't get that I'm going to be a doctor. I'm not a doctor, I want to be a doctor because I am not going to be a doctor. I just want to be a doctor. I'm not a doctor, just a patient. I want to be able to give you the answers you're looking for. I need to figure out how I can best protect you, but I don't understand this terribly."
44,19,"It's just one of those jokes. It's not that I've always said, ""Have you heard of that?"" I just want to say a few things:"
44,20,I've learned some new stuff from a friend in the US he's referring to. It's a pretty common misconception that vaccines aren't meant to be used for all kinds of things.
44,31,">It’s just like the only thing that’s funny is a doctor. I’m not so much a doctor, but I’m a doctor. I’ve been with people who haven’t had a very good sense of humor."
44,40,The CDC is the one that is putting the CDC in a position to try and prove that the CDC does not have the resources to prevent the treatment of viral infections.
44,43,Vaccines are not meant to be used for a specific type of disease. They are not meant to be used for any specific type of disease. They aren’t meant to be used for any specific type of disease. They aren’t meant to be used for any specific type of disease. They aren’t meant to be used for any specific type of disease. They aren’t meant to be used for any specific type of disease.
51,44,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
44,8,'Viscosa' is used by the same people that use 'Vosa' to protect against various types of viruses.
44,11,I think he should go see the CDC because he wants to get it figured out.

Vaccines are not meant to be used for any particular type of disease."
44,16,They're making out with the fact that the people who shit all over themselves are very obnoxious and rude and cling to their opinions. They want to know what's up and when the people who shit about a person are going to get sick or get sick.
44,19,"I can't think of a better term. It's in the sense that we don't use the word ""sneeze"", which refers to the same thing that vaccines have been used for in the past, and not specific to HIV (or any other types of infection, in general), or to the word ""sneeze."" Obviously, it doesn't translate to ""infect."" In other words, the CDC can't give you that. Rather, they should take your advice. They're in no way making a mask. There are very few that"
44,20,"People are going to be dicks, but I'll get it! I don't know if there is a point that says ""I don't want to wear a mask, but I do want to wear a mask,"" or if it's the joke that's making the joke, but I'll say ""Hey, no need for you to make a joke!"""
44,31,Is there a reason to wear a mask to stop an infection? The CDC says so.
44,40,"""If I put on a mask in the bathroom, there are more spores. it’s a lot easier to kill a virus and then get mutated into a person.

44,43,"I've read that people don't have good sense of humor. (I am referring to a joke that was made up and then made up again when I heard this). But I'm not sure if the joke is valid. It's not because I don't like it, it's because I don't like it and I'm not sure what to say."

44,43,"No, it's not meant to stop the spread of HIV, and I'm sorry, but I do think it's a good idea."
51,44,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
44,8,"If it's a joke, you should stop using it. It's not intended to be a joke. It's just an opinion."
44,11,"The CDC's advice is to get your skin clean and sterilized before the test is even done. And for that reason, if you're going to go to a dermatologist, do not use any kind of mask."
44,15,"As you can see, many of these words are not intended to be used in the context of a joke. Some are too extreme. The phrase ""I'm not a doctor"" is a bit misleading and has been overused."
44,16,">I want to be a doctor so I can take the time to do it because it's a bit of a waste of my time, which is ok. I'm really, really into the field of dermatology. So ohhhhh, ohhhhhhh."
44,19,"Vaccines aren't meant to be used for any specific type of disease, unless they are specifically designed to protect against it. Vaccines aren't meant to be used for a specific type of infection. They aren't meant to be used for a specific type of disease."
44,20,I don't think you are the joke or the joke is the thing about the joke.
44,31,"Vaccines aren't meant to be used for any specific type of disease,"
44,40,I’m a cdc volunteer.
44,43,"You are not a doctor, and I am not a doctor, and I cannot do anything for you. I'm not a doctor, and I cannot do anything for you."
51,44,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
44,8,"I've been to a few, mostly positive ones and a few bad ones that I was not sure about, and if you want to know more about the terminology, you can google that and then look up the Wikipedia article. It's a joke, not a joke, but a joke."
44,11,"He was not supposed to wear a mask when he was infected, he was supposed to wear one, and he ended up getting into a bunch of situations, and it wasn't his job to do so. I can't remember what that was, but I was just trying to be a little more thoughtful."
44,15,Vaccines are not meant to be used for a specific type of disease.
44,16,"It seems that a lot of the people who are on the CDC are inherently idiots and they can't be treated with a vaccine. They can't be treated with a vaccine, and that's a huge waste of money."
44,19,It sounds like they're overestimating how many people are infected with HIV.
44,20,It's not a joke. It's a joke.
44,31,"I think people aren't gonna think that vaccines are for viruses, but for any disease. If they can be used for other types of infections, they won't need a specific type of vaccine."
44,40,"It's just that there are people that don't know about viruses. It's not that the CDC is putting the CDC in a position to stop the spread of viruses. It's that people don't know that viruses and parasites aren't parasites. And that there is nothing wrong with shaming your friend for having a virus if you don't have any viruses. It's like saying: ""If you have a virus and do not want to get infected then you're not infected."""
44,43,"""It's not funny that the CDC, the U.S. Health Service, the US Department of Defense, the Department of Defense, and other organizations had a similar position. The CDC, the National Cancer Institute and the Department of Defense have a similar position."
51,44,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
44,8,"People will inevitably end up in a lot of different situations. I'm a doctor, a CDC volunteer, so a CDC article can be of great assistance to you."
44,11,"I don't really have any specific information but I don't have any idea about any type of vaccines, and a CDC/Dir. who is involved is a CDC/Dir. in that regard."
44,15,"Vaccines are not meant to be used for any specific type of disease, unless they can be used for a specific type of disease. They are not meant to be used for any specific type of disease. They are not meant to be used for any specific type of disease. Vaccines are not meant to be used for any specific type of disease. They are not meant to be used for a specific type of disease, unless they can be used for any specific type of disease, like a virus, infect others, or a parasite."
44,16,"I think that is a big problem in this context and that there is a lot of disagreement between the two of them. The wording of the article is simply too insensitive, sexist, etc. I just think the whole thing seems a bit absurd. The joke itself isn't that 'it's a joke,' but rather, the fact that the joke is so arbitrary that it doesn't matter if it was just intended to be a joke."
44,19,You're being naive! They're trying to do things to benefit you.
44,20,You're not a doctor.
44,31,"I’m not a doctor, but I do not want to be a doctor. I want to do the things that will help me. I just have the courage to work through what I want to do."
44,40,"In Texas it's considered a parasite. A parasite, a fungus, and no more than a parasite. It's a parasite."
44,43,Vaccines aren't meant to be used for any specific type of disease. They aren't meant to be used for any specific type of disease.
51,44,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
