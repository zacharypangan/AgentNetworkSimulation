40,10,I think you deserve a fair share of that.
40,15,Is it a joke?
40,17,Yeah but he has to stop. he can do something so that people can just ignore him and keep them in their life.
40,22,I think he s not trying to make you look bad by getting a mask and you looking like you stink so bad you just look bad with the mask
40,24,i was at a party today and he brought my car and got a smile on my face when i said that he wore his mask everywhere
40,27,"The fact that I don't wear a mask on day one doesn't mean I don't want to wear one. I mean, you're only trying to get me in this situation as quickly as possible. You're not going to wear a mask on day two, right?"
40,30,Honestly it would be a huge surprise if I were him he'd have to wear the same mask with the face mask instead of a face mask. Especially if I saw you wearing your face mask for a day and had no idea you were a man so he doesn't even have to take it off because he thinks you can fuck him

40,15,You're having the same reaction to his comment (you're not going to let him put on a face mask).
40,17,He's just making a point. He can stop. He needs to stop. He can do something so that people can just ignore him and keep them in their life.
40,22,It's pretty clear that he's going to be a snob if he doesn't want to show up to a drive-up test. But he's trying to do so in a way that you think he'll be a snob if you start with this and you can't take it off?

40,30,"OP, this is a stupid one... I don't like the ""I cant stop. I want to make you look bad. I want you to stop giving me fucks. I don't need a fuck."""
40,35,"And then when he says you don't twitch, he says that you do. It's a shame he hasn't done this before, because he isn't in the right."
40,38,If you're not willing to take the mask off to make sure he's using it as a safety precaution then he's going to want you to wear it. I don't think he's being that stupid or anything. I think it's time for him to talk himself out of it.
40,39,I'm sorry he can't do it in a funny way.
