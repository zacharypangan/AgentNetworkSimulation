15,8,IANAL but i agree with this.. it is completely ok.. there should be a 'complaint' with the department..

15,8,> (Is it a joke?)
16,8,So you don't have a lot of time to spend on a car?
27,8,This is a misunderstanding. It's one of those things that people seem to think is ridiculous and unwarranted by the Constitution. And it's something that many are surprised about. That's why the amendment is so controversial that it doesn't matter what the ACA says or how people wear them. They don't make the right decision and I would like to see the video as a ploy to keep everyone informed of how much is being spent and how much is being spent and not being able to vote a good one.

30,8,...I am sorry but I don't see how any of your other posts are relevant.
41,8,"When the proposed law for the ACA was repealed in 2009, it would be a state law that prohibits people from wearing masks. The current law wouldn't be slammed down without an approval process. So there's a little reason why they should not use it in a lawsuit."

12,8,I have a a feeling this is the first time I've heard something about that. What if I'm wearing a mask? How would I know that you're putting on a mask?
15,8,That's just a bad idea.
16,8,"You are just as smug as the people in this thread. I've been here for 4 years. But now I don't need the af, but I still don't need the af."
