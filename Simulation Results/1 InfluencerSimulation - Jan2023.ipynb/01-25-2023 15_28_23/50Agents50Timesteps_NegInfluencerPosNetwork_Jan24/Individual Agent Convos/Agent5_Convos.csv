40,5,The funny thing is the last time he asked me if my boyfriend should wear a face mask I got in a car accident.

Firstly, I was really just getting ready to leave work and the last day i was at a job fair and I was being told I was on vacation so that I could stay up all night and not get stuck in the snow while I was riding my bike to work. Secondly, I have the same question, and this is why I'm ignoring it."
40,5,I can't understand why he's in this situation. He's just a dick.
15,5,Is this your mother? Is this your husband?
40,5,This guy is such a dick. He wants to make you look bad - he wants to make you look bad - but he wants people to understand.

40,5,"I'm so sorry, but I thought it was very obvious that this person reacted the way you did.
