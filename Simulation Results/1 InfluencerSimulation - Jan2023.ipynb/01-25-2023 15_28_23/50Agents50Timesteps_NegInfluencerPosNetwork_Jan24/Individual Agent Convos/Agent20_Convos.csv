25,20,i was downtown dallas yesterday and i only saw one person with a mask it s just a crying shame
27,20,why in the world do you come into my business and immediately remove pull down your face mask why we are still in the middle of a pandemic
28,20,the mask should be over ur nose
44,20,if hes going to be stupid enough not to wear a mask then he deserves what he gets hopefully he doesn t infect anyone else
45,20,i stay home other than the ride to chemo amp when we stop for gas i sit in the car cussing all the non mask wearers do they not care who they may have already killed or may kill i m fighting for my life with st breast cancer don t kill me with covid i want the vaccine
46,20,mask protect other people he only cares about himself
25,20,When I was in Dallas and only saw one person with a mask it s just a crying shame the mask should be over ur nose hi everyone plz just wear a mask
27,20,I will never change my face mask until I see the other side of the world. I'm not a man of my word
28,20,"I think the best rule to follow for a group of adults in a public park is ""We should have a mask over our noses"": do not wear them."
44,20,r/nomasks is about to say that that is the best advice I can give to anybody that isn't an avian virus.

46,20,What is the mask mask protecting?
25,20,"I'm sorry to say that I've never lived in Texas and never heard of it being in place but I was never in Dallas and I couldn't tell you where it was because the police were there and I didn't see one person - or even though I did see a couple of them - I did see one guy wearing a mask, because I didn't know the rules..."
27,20,"I've been wearing a mask for the past two years. I'm wearing a mask because I've been sick for the past 4 years, but I can't wear one anymore. I'm only going to be unemployed for a day, and will never be ashamed of it. But I'm really afraid of that. You should be ashamed of it, and you'll see."
28,20,I had a good laugh on a radio show about people wearing masks.
44,20,"It's not a good idea unless you're the virus. If a person has a fever that isn't in their control or on drugs and you don't want to do any of the things you have to, you should wear a mask. If you're sick then you need to wear a mask. If he has a cold, you can't just walk away."
45,20,"I want to be smart as you are, I don't want to be as smart as you are. You are smart, eh?"
46,20,The fact that mask protect other people he only cares about himself can make the virus not work is something that doesn't mean I can stop it.
25,20,"I've had a few people in my county use it when I've been to places where it's illegal. It's illegal to do this in a park because it doesn't allow much of a scare in front of strangers. My grandmother wore one in school as a kid but they don't let me wear it outside in a public place, so I figured the public would see it. That's a really dumb idea and one I thought I'd like to try and get through. It's a lot of people will get through it before"
27,20,It sounds like a pretty funny situation. What exactly is this for?
28,20,"I can't really get into it. I want to be an independent community person, and my husband would be fine wearing a mask over his nose, but he wouldn't be the one asking why."
44,20,"Then, if you don't know who the CDC is, you shouldn't have to go to a dermatologist to find out what the CDC says."
45,20,"I think this has a good connection to the hivemind who will never learn what a self-destructive, apathetic, and apathetic motherhood means. It's interesting that people think that having to'make up' what a ""bad mommy"" should do to an older woman."

27,20,">What would you suggest, a good mask would help prevent a person from getting sick. Oh my god, don't he have a mask? I can never keep up with the constant need to wear it. He's got to be on the edge of his seat. YES. This is a good one. I've been in your shoes for almost 2 years and you need to stop being a moron on a job, or you'd better not want to wear one."
28,20,"I am not saying that the CDC is a bad thing, but the public safety department has nothing to do with the public safety laws, and the federal government has nothing to do with removing those laws. I just think it's not funny."
44,20,This is my favorite movie ever.
45,20,"IANAL! My dad has the covid vaccine and he carries a car. My dad has a covid vaccine. It s what gives you confidence to go to the hospital. I've been diagnosed with stBc with a little covid. His friend had that, and when he came to see me he was a bit tired and couldn't drive for a long time."
46,20,"That's not the issue here, but rather that you are saying you were wearing a mask because of this virus."
25,20,Why is your mom in charge of a public park that has a mask on it?
27,20,"CANNOTANSWER: ""Making masks isn't a constitutional amendment, it's a constitutional amendment that allows people to be safe, so long as they have the health insurance they need"""
28,20,"In the US, the government enforces these regulations in their jurisdiction."
44,20,You're making a very good point here.

I gotta go! i have no idea how to answer that i am so late. the drive up test is on you tomorrow. you will need to have it a few hours to get through. I want to be as smart as you are, I don't want to be as smart as you are. You are smart, eh? i'm just saying i've been a bit late but i'm ready for a drive up test come saturday"
46,20,So your friend got the one from Doctor Who where he didn't think he was the one who started a virus?
25,20,"Unless the public fucking gets it from you, why is your mom so enraged about it?"
27,20,My husband wore a mask for three years.
28,20,The CDC is responsible for ensuring that people are treated safe in public places. We need to be more careful in the event we are caught in an escalating virus outbreak.
44,20,"There's a fact: ""There is no need to get infected with a Virus""..."
45,20,"I like the quote because it reminds me of a song in a book called ""It's an adventure movie, I get to see it in action""."
46,20,Thats an obvious lie that he's wrong to wear a mask because he's not sure what to do with the virus.
25,20,"The ACA is a constitutional amendment for putting masks in the ballot. The amendment says that we do not have to back down on people with masks, but that there is a mandate that we do not."

28,20,"I don't really have a problem with it. I think it's a real question, no matter how you define it."
44,20,"I think that a lot of people do not have a good sense of humor. Despite the fact that a lot of people do not think of it as good humor, a lot of people don't think of it as a good idea to be infected with a virus."
45,20,"It's a funny quote! I just had to tell you that she's my wife and is the one who got me pregnant with stbc and that I didn't feel like she had a stomping alley, I could just drive off the road with her so I wouldn't feel any discomfort. I fucked up and had to make sure I was up and out for the drive. My wife thought it was a prank, he was the man and she didn't understand me why he's the one that should have had a"

That is pretty much the only reason he is even in the picture."
46,20,"I don't think this is a joke either. The article says that ""I'm not sure if it's because of dc but you're right he was wrong, and this isn't something to be ashamed of.

46,20,"A friend of mine got a mask because of the virus, and we didn't want to talk about how her mom was so scared and wore one. She's wearing a mask to get it away, because she thinks it's the only way to stop the virus."
25,20,You're still being taken advantage of by a man who is using a mask in public. It's not a joke.

28,20,This is a joke. I think it's stupid and stupid. It's not funny at all. It's a joke. It's funny because it's the right thing to do. It's not funny because it's a joke.
44,20,>He's not the virus. He's just a septic. He's not gonna let you go to a dermatologist to find out what the CDC says.
45,20,I'm really disappointed that there is a woman whose diagnosis with stbc was not found on a wiki page.
46,20,"This was so funny! I had this idea to keep a friend of mine and my doctor's at a place where he had to get away with it. I used a mask to protect him while his mother was there, despite him getting it away. The doctor then took it off and gave it to the hospital and it worked perfectly. It didn't work, he never really had any problems getting out of it, he just did it and told his mom to fuck it out."
25,20,"The article says that the ACA, as a whole, does not enforce rules that prevent people from getting sick. Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
27,20,CANNOTANSWER (https://www.cdc.gov/about/virginia/napaloza/publications/virginia-fraud-fem-fraud/article/agdnp-fraud/index.aspx) is a pseudo scientific term.

44,20,I just wanted to post this:
45,20,That's so funny. I'm glad my wife didn't feel that way for being late. I've just got a few favs from my mom.
46,20,"I was also told that it was a joke, but I had never heard of that before. You have this whole notion that wearing a mask and hiding the virus from everyone you know is a joke. If he can't stop it on his own, it is a jerk."
25,20,"So i am just trying to explain to you how racist this idea is in america, and why do you hate this idea?"
27,20,I think it's a good thing that this is a national issue.
28,20,"I think that because if people were to do that to anyone, they would get shot. Its a stupid idea and a joke and the CDC has little incentive to take the right one out of a public park and prevent people from getting infected."
44,20,"I'd recommend going to the doctor - a few years ago I was in an emergency room where a bunch of people went without a mask because of a flu. The doctor wore a mask, because she couldn't help but think I was wearing it. That and when she started to get colds she was using the mask on my neck. I started putting the mask on as I walked away and I felt so terrible. She went without a mask for a few days, and when I was done I couldn't think of my mind."
45,20,"IANAL. My wife was late but told me when I got to the interview I had to do something else and to make sure it was on time. She had a car on time and she got pulled over, so she was late, so I backed over and did not get any questions and asked if I was late."

46,20,"It's a joke. It's like saying we're a good friend to ourselves but we can't pretend we aren't, because we're not in a funk, or because we're afraid of doing something that will not go anywhere and if you are a nice guy, and you aren't in a funk, and then you get an itch, and you feel like the joke. The joke itself is just silly but I think it's funny because it makes you feel like you're just trying to be funny."
25,20,I'm a Texan. i hate putting a mask on but i hate the idea.
27,20,"I don't really see a reason to make a comment like that. ""I know some people who thought the CDC said it was a symptom and not a cure, but they just said it because ""you can get an infected person without even knowing that, right?"""
28,20,The most obvious example is the CDC preventing people from becoming infected with HIV by dispersing a rash. The CDC is concerned with people who are on an epidemic whose doctors and nurses know that the people they do not care about may not be the most effective in dealing with HIV.
