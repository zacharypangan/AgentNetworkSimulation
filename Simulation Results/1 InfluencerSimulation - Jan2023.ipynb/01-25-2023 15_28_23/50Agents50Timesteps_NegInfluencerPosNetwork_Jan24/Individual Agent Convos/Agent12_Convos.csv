17,12,thanks ctl stay safe friends and wear mask if need to go out
18,12,if hes going to be stupid enough not to wear a mask then he deserves what he gets hopefully he doesn t infect anyone else
22,12,those who want to protect themselves from getting sick have every right to masks keep you more safe than no mask in tight settings everyone has the right to do whatever they want now at their discretion
24,12,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
25,12,i was downtown dallas yesterday and i only saw one person with a mask it s just a crying shame
41,12,as someone who was there this weekend who lives in a conservative county in california the residents of texas where kind respectful and upheld mask ordinance better than mins of being back in california please let s not turn our backs on people who need help
12,1,"I like to make people shit up, because people are able to do so much. I'm from dallas."
12,2,I can relate to the feeling of being a scumbag if I have to go out with you.
12,8,"No... No. No. The government is not going to pay for this, it's going to be the government doing it for them. I'm not sure if it is worth it, but in my experience it is not an enforceable law, which you should respect. It does have a bit of a moral compass to it."
17,12,This is an interesting concept. The masks are not necessary if you want to take out the virus.
18,12,"I agree with the other comments, but if the only way to prevent a pandemic is to use a mask, you don't have to wear a mask."
22,12,"The masks are for those who are wearing hoods and head masks, not the other way around."

17,12,A lot of people wear masks at a certain point in their lives.
18,12,I haven't even heard of this a sex life.
22,12,You want a mask that doesn't make you look bad?
24,12,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
25,12,"Why do you think that's the most relevant answer, but I think the most relevant answer is that there are some laws to make it a lot easier for people to wear masks. Then it becomes easier to explain to the person why it's necessary."
41,12,"No, we don't. The ACA is a constitutional amendment for putting masks in the ballot."

12,2,Isn't the idea that people should wear masks if they can't afford it.
12,8,"I thought the ""fake"" question was, ""What's the biggest issue with wearing a mask?"""
17,12,>I think a statewide mask mandate is a really illogical and bad idea.
18,12,"...and this is what happened to me last year. The only problem is the lack of airflow - it's almost unnoticeable, and I'm not sure how much we should have put a mask on in the first place."

41,12,Are there any amendments that make that change?
12,1,"So you are saying ""This mask doesn't make people look bad, it's useless and I hate it."" You can't get a sex life with a mask and you aren't going to be able to be able to wear one? That's not like a good mask, is it?"
12,2,This was in a Republican county. I'd be happy to see him out of the town of San Diego who lives in a conservative county in a conservative county.
12,8,"Well, the person that brought this up had an interesting issue. I think I'm going to go with him and say, ""Well, then why don't you just go on your own?"""
17,12,"He doesn't want to make you sick because you have no health insurance. And even if he does, he has no right to do so. That's not a good idea. I'm so glad he made you a better person."
18,12,It is not a smart decision to me.
22,12,"It's pretty clear that he's going to be a snobbish or not. It's a very simple and sensible way to do it. It's ridiculous to say something like, ""i don't really get the virus if you don't wear a mask. You can wear a mask on your face if you can, and if you can't, you're fine with that."""
24,12,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
25,12,"If you are a kid in Texas and only saw one person with a mask, you should be able to tell the police how to stop them."
41,12,"The current law is not working, and should be changed. The state would rewrite it."
12,1,It's not a law to keep it from being implemented.
12,2,"The word ""mamma"" does not apply to this post. Unless you're talking about the ACA that is being passed, it's a state law and you can't have an amendment that makes a law not working."
12,8,Yes he does. Apparently he's got an infection in his head that could easily be treated by a different type of mask that isn't actually safe for you.
17,12,What's the point of having a mask?

17,12,"There is a story where he was infiltrating police departments with a mask on him for the first 4 weeks to cover up his ""snooping"". The first ep had the first name of a shady guy I've met."

22,12,I feel like I was getting some false information as to why he's not the snob. But he's being a snob because he is causing the snob to be a snob.
24,12,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
25,12,"OP is just an 'emotional person' and it isn't a racist statement. He's just saying that there is a need for a proper response to a blatant lack of respect for the human being, because it is inappropriate for people to wear a mask or to be raped by someone else."

She wore a mask to get a snooty nose and that she wouldn't wear a mask to work in the hospital for long enough for her to not be snooty nose when she had sex. Her response was ""I don't think it's really a joke"" and said ""I think it's a snooty nose but snoo"
