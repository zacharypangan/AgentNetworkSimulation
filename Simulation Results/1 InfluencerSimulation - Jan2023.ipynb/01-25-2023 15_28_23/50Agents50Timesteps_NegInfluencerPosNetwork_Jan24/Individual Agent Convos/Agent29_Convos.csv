43,29,thanks ctl stay safe friends and wear mask if need to go out
29,22,"If it is your first time in a month, you must be okay with it. A good rule of thumb is to wear your own mask or at least you can't let it be a burden on you. Unless you are going out for a drink or something, you need to follow it to the end."
29,28,I am so sorry to hear that. 'can you clarify the mask rules and requirements for hoboken parks and playgrounds can you clarify the mask rules and requirements for hoboken parks and playgrounds'.
39,29,Why does the mask make people smell bad? Its because they are a dick and don't want to be around the people who have to wear theirs.

39,29,"The answer is: You don't really get the virus if you don't wear a mask. You can wear a mask on your face if you can, and if you can't, you're fine with that."

41,29,So you are going to have to come to the govt and put up a ballot in the next two years to uphold a mask ordinance? Or do you just want to help people that are already in the area?

29,22,"There are a ton of questions, and they're extremely difficult. I don't understand the purpose of that video and don't understand why the author was addressing those questions."

41,29,"Why is it so bad that the mask ban, even after it's been passed by congress, is still legal in many states? It's also not legal to put a mask on a public street because of a gender barrier.

Honestly, the first thing I thought about was this: ""I'm not your man. Clearly he was merely a white man."
