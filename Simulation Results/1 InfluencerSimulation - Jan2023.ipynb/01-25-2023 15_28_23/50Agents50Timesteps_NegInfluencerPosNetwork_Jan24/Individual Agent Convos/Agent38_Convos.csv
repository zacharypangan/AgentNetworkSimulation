38,30,"Unless you were working in a real job - that is not the same as working in a real job - I would not recommend the idea of an unemployed worker, because they would have some kind of mental illness."

38,17,Tell me something funny about you:
38,19,"Your username is an all-time good joke. You say that your husband is a devil, and he does not want to know what's on his face."
38,25,"I'm a guy. I don't really care how the virus spreads, but a lot of people feel that way, even if they don't want to know what's on their face."

38,27,I think your mother is being rude.
38,30,i sucked at this
38,37,i don't like the idea of a mask. I think I will take some of the same advice as you.
40,38,If you're not willing to take the mask off to make sure he's using it as a safety precaution then he's going to want you to wear it. I don't think he's being that stupid or anything. I think it's time for him to talk himself out of it.
43,38,> He's going to be stupid enough not to wear a mask then he deserves what he gets hopefully he doesn't infect anyone else.

38,26,"I think a joke is a bit funny, since it's a joke and you are a guy."
38,27,"''Um, I'm sorry'', it's not a joke, I'm talking about the mask."
38,30,"I'm not sure I'm joking about this. This is an unrelated post and i like this idea, but I think the commenting is a joke. Rather, you just threw up because you're saying he is a devil. I'm not saying he isn't a devil, but if you're wearing a mask that's one of those things that makes you look like a dead body. I'm going to tell you what if a jobless person leaves with masks on?"
38,37,Why is that the case? It would help if he were to have a job.
40,38,Is he telling you that he has a remorseful idea that will put you in an euphemism?
43,38,"I can’t believe how silly he’s been. How fucked up you were. He was a bit of a dick, but it is definitely necessary to get a mask. A good mask does not prevent a person from getting sick, it is useless and I hate it."
50,38,"I found out about this at the age of 11 I was in and I've seen the entire story. I've only heard a few of the same lines and it's funny because he said that he was'mom' and it's a bad thing that people are so ignorant. I would rather he was a better person. He said something like, ""We can't be wrong,"" I would make some bad decisions. I don't know what to do and who to follow, but it's sad that we are in fact all the way out."
51,38,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
38,4,This is the euphemism for not wanting to be in contact with a devil. You're a dick. You're being a dick.
38,17,This has been going on for a while. I don't want to be an inflammatory narcissist here. I'm sorry that he doesn't have a sex life and I don't have a job at all.

40,38,I had a friend that wore a mask and they both thought it was funny but they were not funny because it was weird. They said he only did it when he was a guy.

38,27,So...why was my wife wearing a mask when she was pregnant and she got infected?
38,30,"The problem with this is that it is so self evident and overblown that it is hard to know if he has a serious mental illness. It's that the masks are so easily obnoxious that the government can't see them from a distance.

38,26,"My husband has never tried wearing a mask, and I'm not sure it's the best solution for his problem, but it is one that makes me feel like I'm being insensitive. He's obviously been trying to elicit positive messages from his family by putting his head on a bus, and he is trying to force that by having sex with them."
38,27,"Why would he need to wear a mask while he's sick? I'm not really saying that you're being a dick, I'm saying that if he had that many sex visits before the virus had started to spread, he would've been more worried about the health of his wife, which he's not."
38,30,"I would tell him to cut off his mask for his mother's sake, or just, ""Don't try to hide it."""

38,30,I don't know about this because i just think that the way that the quote was put out seems like a dick joke. I just think it's a weird thing to ask yourself if you have any idea what's on your face and how to wear it.

38,30,I just got an email from a friend of mine who says that the idea of his husband not having a sex mask when his wife is pregnant makes it really funny unless his wife has a mental illness. The thing is that he's probably a fool as well.
38,37,"My wife's wife is in a similar situation, but she didn't really get her dick shaved off. The husband was a jerk and said he doesn't get sick by accident or have a disease.

43,38,I don't even understand what you mean. I don't understand how this is a joke.
50,38,A lot of people are upset that this is a joke.
51,38,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
38,4,"So, I just came here to get a little help..."
38,17,"Yeah, sarcasm is like a word of mouth, and if you aren't on board with the CDC you are a joke, that isn't it. I'm here to tell you, a few. I'm so sick of hearing this. You have an unending cycle of unanswered questions, if you ever need some advice or inspiration to make some jokes or jokes, I'm here to tell you, a few."
38,19,"I believe you mean that the reason the CDC said ""a good sex mask doesn't prevent people from getting sick. A mask can't prevent people from getting sick."
38,25,"CDC has a policy of not making it a joke, but its trying to get people to buy the vaccines they don't use, which is the reason the ban is a joke. They need a CDC spokesperson to work on this."
38,26,"'I have never tried wearing a mask, and I'm not sure it is the best solution for his problem, but I am more than willing to disagree with that."
38,27,This has to be an interesting topic.
38,30,"I would rather be able to have sex with a friend than with a stranger, I would get the job, but with the woman I'd want sex with is too sick. I would say, ""Is this joke a joke?"
38,37,A CDC meme is a joke.
40,38,"Vaccines aren't meant to kill a virus, and they are not meant to be used for infecting someone else. It's just a mask."
43,38,*[The joke is a joke. The joke is about the joke.
50,38,"I figured if you wanted to go on the fence you would want to do it again and know what happened to the guy you were in a relationship with. I think the question was ""Are you a jerk?""..."
51,38,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
38,4,"CDC (which is based off a myth about what a dick is, but is not actually a real person) is a joke about a sexual sex device. In other words, a mask has a very strong role in preventing infection. You’ve said it before."
38,17,This is a great joke.
38,19,"CANNOTANSWER : ""I mean, if you were a guy you would feel like a dick and if you had the ability to avoid anything like that, the guy you married could be treated much better with a mask."","
38,25,Vaccines are used to halt the spread of the STI.
38,26,"""A friend who likes the idea of a CDC meme as well. I have a friend who likes the idea of a CDC meme as well."
38,27,"> ""What if he told you he was wrong? He lied and he is not a jerk? Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it.''"""
38,30,I just don’t think a good sex mask would stop the virus. That means the mask does not make the patient look like a dead body. I have a feeling I’m just being silly in front of people.
38,37,CDC isn't a joke.
40,38,"This was interesting, but not the CDC’s job."
43,38,"""It's about a joke. It’s about a joke."
50,38,"No, he's a jerk. It's a joke."
51,38,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
38,4,"""I just don't think a good sex mask would stop the virus."""
38,17,It's not a joke. It's just a joke.
38,19,"""The mask is only used for sex. It's used in public for sex as a means of getting sick. They are not meant to prevent someone from getting sick. They are not meant to prevent anyone from getting sick."
38,25,"Yes, it's a joke. They are trying to get people to buy vaccines. But it's a joke. CDC is trying to get people to buy sex vaccinations. The mask is not a joke. The CDC is 'helping' prevent the spread of STIs and is trying to get people to buy them, which isn't the problem."
38,26,"“Hey, I have to tell you that I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I am so sorry. I am so sorry. I don’t understand the “why” part of it.”"
38,27,"""What if he told you he was wrong? He lied and he is not a jerk? Wearing a mask doesn't help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it.'"""
38,30,"I feel like the only person who has ever been to a doctor is a very well-connected guy, but this is not a one off joke."
38,37,"> The mask is for the dick, not the dick. If you were to cut it off, you could have just cut it off. I just don’t know what to do and who to follow. I’m not sure what to do and who to follow. I don’t think this is a good idea to do."
40,38,The CDC is not a septic in their medical terminology. Vaccines kill a virus and infect others. They aren’t. Vaccines aren’t. Vaccines aren’t.
43,38,You're probably on the wrong side of things.
50,38,You're only referring to his response to a joke?
51,38,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
38,4,"The CDC does not need to prevent sex from getting sick. A CDC worker should be using a sex mask. There is no point to the CDC for not doing it, or to help people with STI's."
38,17,"Yes. It's a joke. If they're not going to keep people away from the disease, then it's not a joke. It's a joke."
38,19,"It's not a joke. It's not a joke, but a joke."
38,25,It is a joke because a couple people are saying that these jokes are gonna make people feel like they're not a dick and that people are really not that stupid. But this guy sounds like a really good guy.
38,26,"It's a joke, yes, but they're trying to prevent people from getting sick."
38,27,I don't think it's a joke. Just a joke about a joke.

50,38,"*You know, I'm the only person I've read that says that I think you're being a jerk.

38,19,So basically you're trying to tell me about one of the most embarrassing mistakes I've ever made.
38,25,I think you're missing the most important point in the article:
38,26,"""What if he told you he was wrong? He lied and he is not a jerk? Vaccines aren't. Vaccines aren't. It's not a joke."
38,27,"Is it possible that he’s going to take a hit of it? Maybe, but I’m not sure, because if you had an ex-wife, you’d tell her to do it - he wouldn’t be able to snort with her - because you didn’t want to let her get sick at the same time."
38,30,"""Hey, I'm so sorry. I am so sorry. I am so sorry. I am so sorry. I'm so sorry. I am so sorry. I am so sorry. I am so sorry. I don't know what to say."" (http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/2013/06/r/reddit/)"

40,38,It's a bit funny.
43,38,I’m not sure if I can relate to the whole thing.
50,38,"I don't like that the comments sound like jokes, they just sound like jokes, and I can't stand that saying ""I am not a jerk, but I know I don't know who he was."" makes sense, but what I'm saying isn't even a joke."
51,38,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
38,4,"People wold say they never got sick from their dicks, and that they would not go through with a dick mask."
38,17,You were just reading the title. It doesn't appear that the CDC is joking.
38,19,I feel like this should be an AMA. They have been doing this for over 2 years and I feel like it's probably best that you end up asking them about it if it's going to work.
38,25,You're not being a jerk.
38,26,"It's a joke, yes, but they're trying to prevent people from getting sick."
38,27,Vaccines aren't for some type of disease (like a TB) because they aren't intended to prevent them. Apparently it doesn't give them any type of protection unless they're actually designed for a specific type.
38,30,"I don't think it's a joke. Just like what people are saying, a joke is meant to be funny, not to help people with problems that arise."
38,37,If you want to know how to do it then you've got to tell your husband.
40,38,Vaccines kill a virus but they aren't meant to kill other people. They aren't. Vaccines aren't. Vaccines aren't. Vaccines aren't. Vaccines aren't. Vaccines aren't.
43,38,People with viruses have a variety of problems and a lot of different kinds of infections.
50,38,I've got to get out of here.
