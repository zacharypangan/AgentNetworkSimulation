3,2,can you clarify the mask rules and requirements for hoboken parks and playgrounds
11,3,truth is there s a lot of differing opinions and plenty of studies that say they do help the real problem is that most of the people who are anti mask are just doing it to be jackasses instead of trying to be considerate
13,3,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
16,3,passes are solddd outtt but you can still pay at the door mask required
22,3,those who want to protect themselves from getting sick have every right to masks keep you more safe than no mask in tight settings everyone has the right to do whatever they want now at their discretion
28,3,the mask should be over ur nose
31,3,i like the part when he got covid but still had events with people and how he won t enforce a statewide mask mandate oh and the part where he cut education funding wow so great
36,3,wholeheartedly agree in the last weeks i have had a friend lose his mom to covid and other friend hospitalize with it yesterday i have quit talking to family who insist they don t believe superspreader events happen in churches and people have a right to not wear a mask

13,3,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
16,3,oh god. i just read about the state in my town. i think it is pretty stupid to a large degree afc to go into a hospital because i can't work.
22,3,"If you are sick and you are sick, it is always a good idea to wear masks. But it isn't as effective for everyone else because of the way their skin feels in the skin, so it's not a good idea to go in with people who don't like the fact that they are sick. So if you wear a mask and they don't want to be fucked then you aren't really being sick. You need to be aware that a mask can stop the virus, and if they don't want to be fucked, they"
28,3,What does the mask say about the a v h virus in the hoboken parks and playgrounds?

16,3,I don't even have a mask.
22,3,> Why does the mask make people smell bad? Its because they are a dick and don't want to be around the people who have to wear theirs. Its pretty clear that he's going to be a snob if he doesn't want to show up to a drive-up test. But he's trying to do so in a way that you think he'll be a snob if you start with this and you can't take it off?
28,3,"In NY there are many laws about people wearing masks, but I can't say I know a rule to follow for a group of adults in a public park. I think the best rule to follow for a group of adults in a public park is ""We should have a mask over our noses"": do not wear them."
