34,33,continuing to mask up amp distance reduces the transmission of the virus amp if you do get it the virus won t leave you your immune system will handle it vaccines also reduce pressure on overwhelmed healthcare systems vaccines mean more milder cases if the vaxxed do get it

34,33,I like your use of a mask. I have a friend who has been sick for 3 years and is not aware of how to do this as well. He will probably wear one. The only way to stop it is to tame it.
36,33,I have some ad hominems in my parents and I don't mind. I don't even mind wearing a mask. I also do not mind if they are wearing some sort of mask because they do not want to risk their parents dying.

33,10,So when someone wears a mask and gets sick it's not an issue with you. They're just afraid to be honest about it. If you do what's right it's going to be done for you and your wife.
33,18,"I was at a party where i was not being watched by anyone. I have no doubt that this is why people are sick. The first thing that triggered my panic reaction after my doctor told me to stop wearing my mask was that I was in an emergency. I didn't have a dr with my wife, and I didn't think about that.

He is wearing a mask because it doesn't stop the virus, it means that he shouldn't wear one to prevent it from spreading. It's the whole point of wearing a mask when he wants to be a doctor and not because he doesn't want to do it or because he wants to get a better diagnosis."
