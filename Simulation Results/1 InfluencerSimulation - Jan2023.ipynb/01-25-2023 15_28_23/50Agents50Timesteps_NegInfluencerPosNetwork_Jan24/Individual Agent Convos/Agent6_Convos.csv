43,6,"They're not intended for people with an infectious disease, they're not meant to prevent other types of infectious diseases (such as HIV, which I have no idea what that would be). So the CDC doesn't have to have a different method for treating it. The first is a joke about a doctor who has the virus that's not actually going to kill the virus. He doesn't need to be on his own to get it. Hence, his mask being on. He's wearing a mask. I don't like the CDC. ""I'm not"

6,1,"The CDC, which has a policy of not treating people with HIV, has not had the right policy in place since the early 2000s. It's not saying that it should be banned but it does say that people will have to wear a mask and they'll start working on a program of treatment for it."

31,6,It is a joke because I'm gonna point it out. You don't even have to know what a joke is. You don't know anything about how a CDC commie thinks you should put on a mask if you want to be a doctor. You don't have to tell me something or do anything for fun. It's not a joke. It's a joke.

18,6,I believe this is a legitimate and fair argument. The ACA is a ploy to eliminate a major part of the population that lives there.
28,6,"So, I don't think the CDC is doing anything wrong. They're not trying to force you to wear a mask, but they're trying to force you to wear it, which is a joke. It's a joke, it's a joke. It is a joke."

6,1,I do think it's a bit of a 'joke' to pretend you are the CDC and sexism is an acceptable thing to do.
