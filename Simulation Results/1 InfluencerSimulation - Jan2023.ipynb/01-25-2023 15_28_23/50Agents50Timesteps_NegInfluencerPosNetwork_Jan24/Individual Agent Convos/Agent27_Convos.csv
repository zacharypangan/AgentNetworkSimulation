27,8, Why in the world do you come into my business and immediately remove pull down your face mask why we are still in the middle of a pandemic why in the world do you come into my business and immediately remove pull down your face mask why we are still in the middle of a pandemic
27,9,Why do you want to be unemployed again? Why can't you just have someone that knows how to use their masks and not be embarrassed about wearing them?
27,10,My husband is currently doing it. I'm wearing a mask.
27,20,I will never change my face mask until I see the other side of the world. I'm not a man of my word
27,24,This seems like the type of thing to do for those who are afraid to do it.
38,27,You mean you like the idea of a mask?
40,27,"The fact that I don't wear a mask on day one doesn't mean I don't want to wear one. I mean, you're only trying to get me in this situation as quickly as possible. You're not going to wear a mask on day two, right?"
41,27,The ACA is a constitutional amendment for putting masks in the ballot.
43,27,I would wear masks as long as I'm not prone to sickness and/or death. It's probably better than nothing.
27,8,"I'm not saying to wear a mask, but it's a common mistake. If I had the guts to go through an ACA amendment, I'd do it."
27,9,"There's actually one in your book: ""I will never change my face mask until I see the other side of the world"""
27,10,I've always wondered why people would get embarrassed about wearing a face mask.
27,20,"I've been wearing a mask for the past two years. I'm wearing a mask because I've been sick for the past 4 years, but I can't wear one anymore. I'm only going to be unemployed for a day, and will never be ashamed of it. But I'm really afraid of that. You should be ashamed of it, and you'll see."
27,24,The ACA is a constitutional amendment for putting masks in the ballot. I would wear masks as long as I'm not prone to sickness and/or death. It's probably better than nothing.
38,27,"Yeah, if you can't wear a mask that's one of those things that makes you look like a dead body. I've seen it happen with my masks, but I know what you mean."
40,27,He wants a fuck. He wants to give you fucks. He wants a fuck.
41,27,That's exactly what this one does. I don't think it's a good idea to make this one up and put up a petition.
43,27,"Oh my god, don't he have a mask? I can never keep up with the constant need to wear it. He's got to be on the edge of his seat."
27,8,"YES. This is a good one. I've been in your shoes for almost 2 years and you need to stop being a moron on a job, or you'd better not want to wear one."
27,9,You don't think you can afford to put on a mask? That's just an insult to you.
27,10,I've been looking for a reason to avoid wearing a mask to get help from a doctor.
27,20,It sounds like a pretty funny situation. What exactly is this for?
27,24,"""Making masks isn't a constitutional amendment, it's a constitutional amendment that allows people to be safe, so long as they have the health insurance they need"""
38,27,I think your mother is being rude.
40,27,"What a fucking blunder. He's not going to get you to be able to keep you in your life. I just want to know what he thinks of what he wants to do, because I don't think it is a fucking blunder. He's getting you to accept that."
41,27,"If they do not follow the same rules, it could be considered racist."
43,27,"> What would you suggest, a good mask would help prevent a person from getting sick. Oh my god, don't he have a mask? I can never keep up with the constant need to wear it. He's got to be on the edge of his seat. That's a terrible thing to say Thanks - thank you! I'm also glad you know how to make this video. I am not a medical doctor. I am a medical professional."
27,8,"You sound like a liar. I can't explain to you why I'm going to make this video. This guy is making me slut, and you are expressing that he's a liar and you're trying to hide that fact. It's like he has a special talent for making movies like ""Sucks in a box"" or something similar."
27,9,"CANNOTANSWER: ""Making masks isn't a constitutional amendment, it's a constitutional amendment that allows people to be safe, so long as they have the health insurance they need"""
27,10,This is the same reason my wife wants to help her child with cancer

27,24,The first thing you need to know about this situation is that it seems like you've always wondered why people would get embarrassed about wearing a mask. It sounds like your mother has been going around asking for this as a way to reassure you that you're the one bringing you up and that you should stop being an asshole to her.
38,27,"''Um, I'm sorry'', it's not a joke, I'm talking about the mask."
40,27,He's like the dick of old people:
41,27,"The ACA is a constitutional amendment for putting masks in the ballot. The amendment says that we do not have to back down on people with masks, but that there is a mandate that we do not."
43,27,I want a video of me with my wife - and I want it to be more about her.
27,8,This is a misunderstanding. It's one of those things that people seem to think is ridiculous and unwarranted by the Constitution. And it's something that many are surprised about. That's why the amendment is so controversial that it doesn't matter what the ACA says or how people wear them. They don't make the right decision and I would like to see the video as a ploy to keep everyone informed of how much is being spent and how much is being spent and not being able to vote a good one.
27,9,> The first thing you need to know about this situation is that it seems like you've always wondered why people would get embarrassed about wearing a mask.
27,10,"""...I'm not a medical doctor, I am a medical professional. I just want to know what he thinks of what he wants to do, because I don't think it is a fucking blunder."""
27,20,"CANNOTANSWER: ""Making masks isn't a constitutional amendment, it's a constitutional amendment that allows people to be safe, so long as they have the health insurance they need"""
27,24,I think it's a tad creepy to point out that the masks in my video are used because they prevent people from getting sick. It is also a tad disgusting and potentially dangerous to you. It's pretty fucking ridiculous.
38,27,"This is hilarious. I mean, he did the right thing and you didn't."
40,27,">This is a symptom, not a cure, and it's incredibly annoying."
41,27,"I know I've been to some of the most racist places on the planet and people in my town are all incredibly racist, but what I do have to say is, it sounds like the people in my town were not allowed to wear masks, and that is what they were allowed to wear. I had a very nice sex drive in a town where there are some of the most racist places on the planet."
43,27,"It was the best video I've seen, and I hope it's more about her, not your husband's."
27,8,The ACA doesn't revoke the right to wear a mask.
27,9,>I want a video of me with my wife - and I want it to be more about her.
27,10,He can't afford to have a child with a medical condition in the US?
27,20,My husband wore a mask for three years.
27,24,"I think you're overreacting, especially since you've been to some of the most racist places on the planet."
38,27,"I'm not even sure what that would be about. My husband would do that. I was a bit dick about it. I didn't want to get in contact with him. He made it clear that he's not going to do this, and it's time to tell him that the masks aren't for sex or anything else."
40,27,"I think that the first sentence is ""He's like the dick of old people: I'm a young man. I was one of those people. I was a girl who liked women and wanted to have a bit of fun while she was driving. I went out and bought her some of these products (and I am so glad he's not a douche and that she wanted to wear a mask) while we were driving and she had to keep the mask on her face to get rid of the virus.

27,9,"I'd like to know what he thinks of what he wants to do, because I don't think it's a blunder."
27,10,"It is very unlikely that a patient can afford to have a child with a medical condition. Certainly not a cure. If he is going to wear a mask, he would need to be able to pay for all of it and that will come with the ACA. The fact that it will do nothing, it is completely ridiculous."
27,20,"CANNOTANSWER: ""Making masks isn't a constitutional amendment, it's a constitutional amendment that allows people to be safe, so long as they have the health insurance they need"""
27,24,"The reason for this is that the ACA doesn't do that, but that it isn't a constitutional amendment."
38,27,So...why was my wife wearing a mask when she was pregnant and she got infected?
40,27,"I don't think you know what a dick is, I think it's very simple. He's got a job, he's a douche, but it's not about keeping you safe - he's about letting his wife have sex, he's about keeping his life happy."
41,27,I think it's important to look for ways to address the situation.
43,27,">I'm not sure if it's because of my health, but it is definitely necessary to get a mask. A good mask does not prevent a person from getting sick, it is useless and I hate it."
27,8,"As someone who lives in Florida, I can say that there's a lot more to that than the ACA."
27,9,I don't think it's a blunder at all to try and talk about this. It sounds like he was making a crappy move.
27,10,"CANNOTANSWER: ""Making masks isn't a constitutional amendment, it's a constitutional amendment that allows people to be safe, so long as they have the health insurance they need"""
27,20,i'm not the dick who says this.
27,24,Why is it illegal for an adult to wear a mask because it stops a person from getting sick? Is this the one thing that made you think he needed to buy a mask?
38,27,"A mask can't prevent the infection if it is worn properly or not. The CDC, in their mandate, has to remove the mask in place of the infection."
40,27,"It's not about keeping you safe, it's about letting his wife have sex."
41,27,I wouldn't think that he would try and get a man to come to that conclusion if his own town decided not to put a sleeve on the streets in public.
43,27,I am not a doctor. I am a medical professional. I can make videos of myself with my wife.
27,8,"I'm not a lawyer. But I've been in the shoes of patients and they wear masks. The one thing they are trying to explain is they're being ""pro-choice"" when they say ACA isn't a valid solution to the issue. If they are unable to do so, that's a very bad idea and I doubt the situation would change if I had to do that."
27,9,"In my opinion, if he was making a crappy move, then the CDC is not a constitutional amendment. In the US, the government is not authorized to remove masks, but does allow an adult to wear them in public."
27,10,"i'm not sure if i know the answer, but the answer is yes, making a mask can prevent an infection but that shit does not stop anyone from getting sick"
27,20,">A good mask does not prevent a person from getting sick. Oh my god, don't he have a mask? I can never keep up with the constant need to wear it. I'm only going to be unemployed for a day, and will never be ashamed of it."

The one where the husband has a mask is really great, not to mention the one on his face is very weird and you are being a dick. I love it if you can help me, it's really great if I can help you. So...why was my wife wearing a mask when she was pregnant and she got infected."
40,27,"It's called a ""Dick"" slash, which is a very common word used in the American sense for dick-shaming. A doctor will make it clear that you aren't going to help, and it is important that you stay in your head about it."
41,27,I think that it's a good thing that this is a national issue.
43,27,">I thought you would say ""I'm not sure if it's because of my health, but it is definitely necessary to get a mask. A person who has a virus that has been infected doesn't have to wear a mask, so as to have to wear a mask when it resides in the area."
27,8,"It's like a dick on the way to work to make a doctor. He might have to buy a mask to prevent it from getting infected, but he can't. I'm sorry."

27,20,"This isn't a constitutional amendment, it's a constitutional amendment that allows people to be safe, so long as they have the health insurance they need."
27,24,I think this is one of the first comments you should take from me. You are saying something that makes me uncomfortable.
38,27,"You're a creep! A lot of people feel that masks are a sex mask. I don't understand why this guy is so resentful of his husband, but he's a creep."
40,27,"He's just a dick, not a cure. It's not about keeping you safe, it's about letting your wife have sex."
41,27,I would also take a deep breath for a minute before putting the ACA in the ballot. I'd have a pretty decent idea why you think it's racist.
43,27,CANNOTANSWER (https://www.cdc.gov/about/virginia/napaloza/publications/virginia-fraud-fem-fraud/article/agdnp-fraud/index.aspx) is a pseudo scientific term. A person who has a virus that has been infected doesn't have to wear a mask. A person who has a virus that has been infected doesn't have to wear a mask.
27,8,"I mean, we can't say how the world would be if the president of the United States did. It was a lot easier for the US to convince people to vote for an amendment to allow people to wear a mask and have people a better life than a woman, or a man or woman that had a more powerful chance of getting an ACA Amendment. And the world could use a similar amendment to make it even easier for them to go for it."

I don't think he had any rights."

27,10,"I don't think it's racist. If a person's health is compromised, a CDC audit would not be conducted by the government, so I think the ACA should be ruled on by the government to determine whether that's the case, and not by a judge."

41,27,"The first thing that came to mind is that 'Cannot believe this is a big issue'. ""The ACA isn't racist because you don't know what it is, that's not a big issue.

38,27,"Is it possible that he’s going to take a hit of it? Maybe, but I’m not sure, because if you had an ex-wife, you’d tell her to do it - he wouldn’t be able to snort with her - because you didn’t want to let her get sick at the same time."
40,27,"What do you mean ""I don't think you know what a dick is, I think it's very simple. He's got a job, he's a douche, but it's not about keeping you safe, it's about letting his wife have sex."""

38,27,Vaccines aren't for some type of disease (like a TB) because they aren't intended to prevent them. Apparently it doesn't give them any type of protection unless they're actually designed for a specific type.
40,27,"I’m so sorry about that. I know I am being misinterpreted in this way but if I am you, the point is still pretty much the same."
41,27,A Texan was a member of the ACA and the ACA is a tithing thing. The ACA was written on a sleeve to rape a girl. He was also a member of the ACA party and the ACA is legal.
43,27,A lot of people in this thread may not be qualified doctors unless their patients are suffering from a variety of different types of infections. Some people are actually very young people and would rather be treated than treated.
