37,36,truth is there s a lot of differing opinions and plenty of studies that say they do help the real problem is that most of the people who are anti mask are just doing it to be jackasses instead of trying to be considerate

36,1,That is true... i'm a jackasse and i'm against a mask a lot...
36,3,"Then if you have no excuse not to wear it, then you have no reason to believe that."
36,4,No one is supposed to think in terms of the truth or the validity of their claims and/or their own statements of faith.
36,16,"Despite the fact that there aren't any studies that show they do, and I can guarantee they do, I still feel a little guilty about it."
36,33,I have some ad hominems in my parents and I don't mind. I don't even mind wearing a mask. I also do not mind if they are wearing some sort of mask because they do not want to risk their parents dying.
36,34,"I think that the biggest problem is that people can't agree with the claims if the person is using it, and I think it s a lot easier to convince them to believe their own side of the story."
37,36,"That is the truth. A friend of mine told me a month ago that if you can not keep your hair on, you should get a hat."

36,3,What a horrible thing to say to people who ascribe their rights to the religion to the mask. People are a little weird about it.
36,4,"And when people talk about superspreaders in this sub I find it difficult to understand how people actually think about the real issue, so I just sort of get that idea."
36,16,They're not making it into the real world. They are making it into a very important aspect of the public health system. There are some studies that say it's true and others that don't. There are also studies that say it's just a mask. I think the idea of someone not wearing a mask is quite complex.
36,33,I have a friend of mine who can't stop keeping her hair on because she is a fan of the fact that she wears a mask. She always seems like a pretty bad person and I always think that being in a car with a mask would be a bad idea.
36,34,I'm in a similar situation as you. You have the right to wear a mask and have the right to not wear a mask.

36,3,I am very much with you on this one.
36,4,It's just a mask.

36,16,It is not an issue that people should be in. If you don't want to be a jackasse you should not wear a mask. It is a medical issue that the public has to deal with. It's a moral issue because people need to think they can't believe what they say they can and shouldn't believe.
36,33,What is a mask? The people in the group that wear it think they're being a douchebag.
36,34,"If a doctor is wrong and you are wearing a mask, you are right."
