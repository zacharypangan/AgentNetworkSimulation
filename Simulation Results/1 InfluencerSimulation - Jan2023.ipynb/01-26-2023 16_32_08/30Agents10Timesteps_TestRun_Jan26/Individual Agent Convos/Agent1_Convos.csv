19,1,"Yes, it's really interesting in light of people's resistance to wear a mask both the mask and the shopping cart are measurements of empathy"
26,1,"That's why my parents would always wear them and put my own hair on the back of my head. I thought it was funny, it was so cute and I like wearing it to do it when I was younger"
27,1,Definitely not a bad idea

26,1,The fatties are fun! A little bit of it
27,1,> Definitely not a bad idea I would never have gotten in the mood for one in a day with a huge covid who didn't wear a mask.
29,1,"I think in the future, we will go to a doctor to get the dang virus out of our eyes."
6,1,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
19,1,I never actually play painting games but have a real problem with the one in the park. I can see the nvp sports park being pretty popular but it would probably be more interesting to see a public park full of people who want to play instead of just having fun with one.
26,1,"It would probably be more difficult to get out of my nose if I went out in public with a fat lip in. I can't tell if it's a racial or sexual stereotype, but if it's a valid point of view for many people. A fat lip in is the sexiest thing, it's not a healthy thing to do in a day. I'm sure the guy with the fat lip in doesn't know what he's talking about."

19,1,I grew up in a city with an extremely expensive park in it and no one cared to go to it. It is not a public park and it is just a way for kids to participate and enjoy.

19,1,">I'm not a huge fan of the old man's attitude towards masks :p If you wear a mask and don't use them, you don't have enough time to wear them. I can think of a lot of good stuff on the nvp sports park - but the public park is full of people. It's too much of a stretch."
26,1,It seems like a perfect metaphor for a woman with a problem with self-esteem. This sounds like a perfect metaphor for a woman with a problem with self-esteem.

19,1,"Then, for me, I guess I just know there is no place for kids to go and I feel that I've made enough money on the art show to get into it. So, my comment is merely my personal opinion. I don't think anyone likes it if you're afraid of being exposed to an environment that's a little different than mine. It's a bit unfair to say that I love the park, but I'm sure you're very happy with the idea of a public park because there's no reason not to have a public park."
26,1,You can see the difference if you wear it as soon as possible.

19,1,"People who don't wear a mask will have trouble with it. The old man is an idiot, and if the public park has a problem, it has a problem."
26,1,"I've been told that, as a woman, you can't ""make your own sex mask"" and not ""have sex,"" and are the only women that think the ""sexy thing"" is a sex mask. There is a video on YouTube about this, but I don't want to be too hard on myself. It's funny if you ask me."
27,1,It's a shame that the title is misleading and he says it's a little bit misleading.
