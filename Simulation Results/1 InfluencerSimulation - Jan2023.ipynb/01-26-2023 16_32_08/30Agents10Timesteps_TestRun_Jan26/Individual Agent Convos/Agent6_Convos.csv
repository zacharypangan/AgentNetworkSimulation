19,6,"Its interesting that the nvp sports park is not a public park, and the people who wear them are supposed to be free. This means that there is only one open play in the park"
23,6,"Yeah if you can get vaccinated, you are one of the olympic champions."
25,6,"As a person who has a terrible attitude towards racism in the past, if you are vaccinating children, you should wear a mask as much as you can."

19,6,"My friend did this. He says that it's important to learn to be socially aware of the environment and not make it a public park a place where people can play. He said it's very much more than just a private park, but that if you have kids or don't have a family you have to learn to interact with others. He said that people are really afraid of being exposed to that environment, not that they are supposed to know what it's like to be a part of the environment."
23,6,I always thought I was being the first person to describe how my son would look if he was in a mask. I think that's a bit more wack than he thought.
25,6,"In all honesty, that's a great reminder to all my friends :)"

19,6,They should also teach a couple of people not to wear masks. The one thing they do is teach them to think with a sarcasm lens :(
23,6,"Well, it's really more of a way of teaching a child about santa's physical illness than a way of teaching a kid about vaccines."
25,6,That's hilarious. If I was your friend you would revert to a rap idiocy.

19,6,I can think of a lot of good stuff on the nvp sports park - but the public park is full of people. It's too much of a stretch.
23,6,He did the mask because of some sort of illness. His parents are a bunch of people who don't even know what santa is.
25,6,"""What would make me sad and he said I need to do the same. """

19,6,"Yes, it's really interesting in light of people's resistance to wear a mask both the mask and the shopping cart are measurements of empathy"
23,6,A mask can't stop the disease. It's called a helmet.

19,6,"I think this is one of the most tame topics in this subreddit. It's more about people trying to get a ""get out of my car"" attitude, instead of an actual ""go to the park""."
23,6,I'd be scared of having kids who were in a mask. It would make them feel like there is a real deal on their hands.
25,6,He's pretty much right about it.

23,6,"""The title is wacky. I wouldn't be scared of having kids who were in a mask. It's useless and I hate it."""
25,6,I'm a little repressed when I tell people that I'm rapping and that it sucks when they're rapping and that if I don't wear a mask it isn't something I should wear. And when I tell people that they are rapping it isn't going to hurt themselves or anything.

19,6,I'm not sure you would want a public park. I'd want a playground with a public art exhibit. But my girlfriend wouldn't like it.
23,6,"The title is just the way I describe it. I don't like that title, it's just not relevant."

19,6,The Human Paradox is a good one.
23,6,"This is the very thing that really comes to mind if you read the title, it reminds me of the joke and the idiocy."

19,6,"IANAL. It's a good film, which it is on TV, and I've read about it in other places before."
23,6,I really hope you don't read the book to the end of it. You're a rapper.
25,6,"""I don't know why you would think so."""
