29,9,I don't understand what the statement says because it varies from state to state and I don't think it's the same thing for all people
29,10,As uncomfortable as it may be especially with the conditions we work in i d rather adapt wear the mask and survive than contract the virus of what s more comfortable
29,21,I think I read that all the other people here are saying as uncomfortable as it may be especially with the conditions we work in and this one is being eloquent.
29,1,"I've been in that position for two years, and the mask was quite uncomfortable. I never felt a bit uncomfortable and I was uncomfortable with being forced to change."
29,9,Is that all the other posts of yours?
29,10,"I can't really say the words are the same as they are in the wikipedia page, but the person is saying, ""I don't understand what the statement says because it varies from state to state and I don't think it's the same thing for all people"
29,21,"CANNOTANSWER: ""as uncomfortable as it may be especially with the conditions we work in i d rather adapt wear the mask and survive than contract the virus of what s more comfortable"
29,1,"You can be uncomfortable with being forced to change, but that's not the same as being forced to change."
29,9,It's interesting that people are attempting to say something sexist because of the amount of 'traumatization' that they're making about the work environment.
29,10,"CANNOTANSWER: ""As uncomfortable as it may be especially with the conditions we work in i d rather adapt wear the mask and survive than contract the virus bc of what s more comfortable"
29,21,It makes no sense at all.
29,1,"I think the person's point is that there are still more people in the world than CANNOTANSWER, and you are not being sexist."
29,9,"So you said ""as uncomfortable as it may be especially with the conditions we work in i d rather adapt wear the mask and survive than contract the virus of what s more comfortable. """
29,10,It makes no sense at all.
29,21,And CANNOTANSWER is using this same line in a way that makes no sense at all.
29,1,">CannotanSWER: ""As uncomfortable as it may be especially with the conditions we work in i d rather adapt wear the mask and survive than contract the virus of what s more comfortable"""
29,9,When you get to the point where the word is 'confirming' it is a quote that contradicts the line. The same line eludes me.
29,10,What's the name of this guy that's making a statement about the 'traumatization' that's happening around him?
29,21,"I think the person's point is that there are still more people in the world than CANNOTANSWER, and you are not being sexist. So you said ""as uncomfortable as it may be especially with the conditions we work in i d rather adapt wear the mask and survive than contract the virus of what s more comfortable"""
