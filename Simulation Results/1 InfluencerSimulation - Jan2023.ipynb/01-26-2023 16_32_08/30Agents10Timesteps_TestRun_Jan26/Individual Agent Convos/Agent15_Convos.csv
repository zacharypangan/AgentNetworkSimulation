20,15,i m so sorry mark but i don t trust this vaccine i understand your concern for the residents of erie county i obey the mask mandate wash and sterilize my hands when returning home from work and elsewhere
15,3,My friend is a nurse and has an appointment to come with me in April so if you have the same concern then that's when the symptoms are coming back. And that's when it hurts.
15,4,I don't trust this vaccine
16,15,Please hear this please he hear this please he hear this
19,15,i don't think there is much that makes a play more appealing than a mask.
20,15,"I have had this happen to me. It's great, and I'm just a little upset that people in this country are taking a stand."
15,3,Are you sure you don't want to be taken out by a virus that isn't gone?
15,4,"They are doing a good job of cleaning up the public health care system, not the sick people. I think that people in this country are actually a bunch of nice, hardworking people and some of the most compassionate people in the country."
16,15,i'd like to say that the best way to deal with the virus is to wear a mask and not to get a savage cyborg mask
19,15,I'm not a huge fan of the old man's attitude towards masks :p
20,15,A fucking fucking man. I'm sorry but I don't believe the truth.
15,3,"It's been a week, and you've done a great job of clearing this up. People are caring about their health and they care about the fucking people who are putting up with it. I hope you find a therapist whose job you enjoy, not just a nurse, that is helping you to find a better solution to this."
15,4,"I want to be a a politician, because if I am the mayor, I can be a politician."
16,15,hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey this idiocracy in my head i am so sick of the whole joke Please hear this please he hear this please he hear this.
19,15,What's the point of having a public art exhibit in a park? Because we're all there for fun.
20,15,It's the only reason why people on this sub aren't wearing masks. They're just an excuse to be afraid of what they can't get away with.
15,3,"Well if you can't tell me about the masks, there's no better way."
15,4,I hate to say it but my friend is not a really good friend.
16,15,It's wacky. I think people need to go on their own and have the same thought process as this. I think people need to go on their own and have the same thought process as this.
19,15,"I've heard that there is a public park on the nvp sports park. So I wonder what it would be like to have a public art exhibit in a park that is not a public park, and the people who wear them are supposed to be free."
20,15,"I just wanted to yell at you for saying it but I don't want to make that sound like a big deal. I can see why people would put their face under the mask if they were gonna do it. But yea, I really don't think you can do it. Y'know, OP is the kind of person that'll change it for you if you don't wear a mask."
15,3,"I was in a hospital with a few people who were not vaccinated. Some people don't, but in my case, my friend was vaccinated. I waited for a patient to get a test and if they didn't get vaccinated, they just didn't do it."
15,4,"> I think that people in this country are actually a bunch of nice, hardworking people and some of the most compassionate people in the country."

19,15,I'm actually a fan of nvp sports and I wouldn't care about having a public park in a public park. It's a shithole shithole.
20,15,"It seems like a perfect metaphor for a woman with a problem with her self-esteem. ""Make a mask to wear it with me."""
15,3,"""They are doing a good job of cleaning up the public health care system, not the sick people. i'd like to say that the best way to deal with the virus is to wear a mask and not to get a savage cyborg mask I'm not a huge fan of the old man's attitude towards masks :p"
15,4,"> I hope you find a therapist whose job you enjoy, not just a nurse, that is helping you to find a better solution to this."
16,15,"Y'know, right? [NAP] [Sweet] **Sweet**!"
19,15,"Honestly, I find it funny that you mention this a few times. My girlfriend and I would suggest this post on I've heard that there is a public park on the nvp sports park."
20,15,I don't think it's a perfect metaphor for a woman with a problem with her self esteem.
15,3,"It's my own personal experience and I'm just a little scared of a viral infection - my life is too wacky to care enough to not have a mask, even if I don't want to."
15,4,"This is one of those post you have to check to be sure it isn't a sexist joke, but a perfect fit to make a friend feel sorry for him or her."
16,15,I was a lot older than I am and I've always known this guy and he always seems a bit like the clown.
19,15,"I've been to several public parks where you and I haven't been, I think this is where I need to get my head around."
20,15,"There's one of the worst things you can do in life. The world isn't a perfect world. People are conditioned to live. And yet, the people who say it aren't."
15,3,"Honestly, I find it funny that you mention this a few times. My girlfriend and I would suggest this post on I've heard that there is a public park on the nvp sports park."

16,15, I think people need to go on their own and have the same thought process as this.
19,15,I have a bunch of friends who like to go to museums and enjoy the beauty of the park.
20,15,"What do you mean by that? This is not like rap music, but it's a fun song, if played with the lyrics. The lyrics are very beautiful. Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
15,3,I'd say it's a perfect metaphor for a woman with a problem with her self esteem.
15,4,I don't see how that is the problem with this. There is one sexist joke you need to understand and it is a bad one.
16,15,"The world is going to be the worst place in the world for people to be so sick. You've never been to any epoch or been in a hive mind, but when you've seen the video and read it, you can't help but feel a little helpless. That's not a good way to live. That's a problem that's not being solved in your life."
19,15,I'm a fan of it. But this is just a playground.
20,15,That's what a rap music meme is.
15,3,"I have a couple of people who wear masks while in the hospital. They're my own friends and I'm one. They're a friend, and I think it's nice to see that they are wearing masks. I would be super interested in hearing about this at my friends. My friend likes to do stuff outside while he's vaccinated, and he's wearing masks when he's not vaccinated. He's a friend, and he loves me and is trying to make me feel like he's going around"
15,4,There's a bunch of different places to go when you're in a health state.
16,15,He's trying to make a joke about being the biggest faggot in the world. This guy is just getting into all the humor and making fun of people who aren't very funny. It's like rap and the video says he's trying to make it sound like he's better or better or better than anyone else.
19,15,I have a favorite movie called The Human Paradox. It's a very good movie.
20,15,"People who get sick after watching the same show about guys rapping in public isn't as bad. This is about a joke, not rap."
