16,15,please leep your mask on i don t want you to be taken out by a virus that is not gone
23,16,we keep hearing about how most kids quickly recover from covid pretty hard to recover from this wear a mask and if you can get vaccinated
24,16,please wear a mask amp bend over
27,16,huge covid fail to have santa not wearing a mask in thanksgivingdayparade would have been so powerful and such an endorsement of healthcareheroes wearamask
16,2,You mean this isn t a fake joke?
16,5,"Isn't that a joke? I was in the video and it came up with the name troll, but that was a joke."
16,7,I'd like to say that the best way to deal with the virus is to wear a mask and not to get a savage cyborg mask.
16,9,hey i'm sorry but this idiocracy in my head i am so sick of the whole joke 
16,15,Please hear this please he hear this please he hear this
23,16,"We are not immune. We are sick. You can get vaccinated, but we need to take a second look."
24,16,I agree with that. But it doesn't seem like you actually want to wear a mask. Do you think you will be more effective at it?
27,16,I would never have gotten in the mood for one in a day with a huge covid who didn't wear a mask.
16,2,"Yes, the most effective way to deal with the virus is to wear a mask and not get a savage cyborg mask."
16,5,"I don't know if you have to wear a mask, but the fact that it's a joke, and it's not something I would get over."
16,7,hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey this idiocracy in my head i am so sick of the whole joke Please hear this please he hear this please he hear this.
16,9,I think he's actually trying to be humorous and he sounds like he's trying to tell you that he's in a joke to make it look good but that the joke isn't real
16,15,i'd like to say that the best way to deal with the virus is to wear a mask and not to get a savage cyborg mask
23,16,I would be scared if the kids were gonna get vaccinated or not. I am sure it would hurt them for life and not be able to do it. I really can't believe my parents aren't all sick and sick. You might think that. It would just be a way for them to learn about the virus or something and they might just be scared of them.
24,16,"I think people need to go on their own and have the same thought process as this. I haven't done that, but I'm going to have to ask myself if there are other people out there who want to wear a mask and then give them a mask and then go home."
27,16,The name of the band is not funny enough. The song makes a lot of sense. It's called A Nightmare in the World.
16,2,"I think you really like this idea of how I would respond to this. It makes me want to go and wear a mask, but to be honest I wouldn't. I would just let my mom know I want to wear my mask and be happy."
16,5,My dad has a great joke about getting a mask and saying you'd be scared if they're not able to get one.
16,7,You don't have to wear a mask to go get vaccinated.
16,9,"It's an idiocracy in my head that makes it look silly, but I think that he just wants to make fun of people who are sick and have issues with their own skin / adolescence. The fact that he is trying to be funny is what makes it a joke."
16,15,hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey this idiocracy in my head i am so sick of the whole joke Please hear this please he hear this please he hear this.
23,16,It’s wacky. I wouldn’t be scared of kids not getting vaccinated.
24,16,"I don't have a mask. I don't wear a mask. I don't wear it as I am not working out. I am unable to walk for a while without getting a hiccup. I don't understand why people should wear a mask if they don't like wearing it, and what the point of wearing a mask in your head is."
27,16,> The only good thing I can say about this is I don't like seeing people do this in public. It helps me be safe. I'm gonna be going to a good rap festival and I will be happy that my friends and I aren't wearing the same mask.
16,2,"You do get the joke that the virus is real and not just to do a mask. The joke also makes people think about it like that but in reality, the actual joke is not."
16,5,"Yes, the best way to deal with the virus is to wear a mask and not get a savage cyborg mask. Yes, the most effective way to deal with the virus is to wear a mask and not get a savage cyborg mask."
16,7,Your friend has a new song called A Nightmare in the World that has some funny lyrics to it.
16,9,"""I think you are not immune. We are sick. You can get vaccinated, but we need to take a second look."
16,15,It's wacky. I think people need to go on their own and have the same thought process as this. I think people need to go on their own and have the same thought process as this.
23,16,"I don’t know why kids would want a helmet for santas physical illness. Regardless, I think it’s still wacky that it’s going to make people afraid."
24,16,oh man. what are you doing with the hiccup?
27,16,i think it is also very important to remind you that a lot of these people are in the same situation as you are.
16,2,I don't think that a clown or a clown would actually need to wear a mask to prevent a hiccup.
16,5,"Hey, I didn't notice you were so funny..."
16,7,"The thing is, ""I think we need to go on our own"" (http://www.r&nr_irrelevant.com/resources/default.aspx?reference=nvr/references)."
16,9,"IANAL, but that is not the only way to get vaccinated in public. I’d like to say that the best way to deal with the virus is to wear a mask and not get a savage cyborg mask."
16,15,>I think people need to go on their own and have the same thought process as this. I think people need to go on their own and have the same thought process as this.
23,16,"I know I'm not rapping, but I'm not sure that would be the proper title. The title should have been ""It's wacky. I wouldn't be scared of kids not getting vaccinated. """
24,16,In my opinion it's a lot easier to just wear a mask for fun. I spit on my skin and I am sore - and the rest of my body isn't coping well. But I can still be able to move a limb or face through it. I don't want people to see that if I do wear a mask I don't want people to think I would be better.
27,16,"OP is being rapped by someone who doesn't like rap. He's trying to be a rap artist to avoid being the one rapping about the virus and not himself, because this guy isn't even rapping."
16,2,"My favorite part of the quote was ""A Nightmare in the World."" I'm also a big fan of ""I'd rather be on my own than raped by some creepy old man with the virus"""
16,5,"I know I'm not rapping, but I'm not sure what it's called. Honestly, I think the best way to deal with the virus is to wear a mask and not get a savage cyborg mask. That's kind of like trying to figure out how to fix people in a way that would make them genuinely nervous or afraid."
16,7,hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey
16,9,"I am gonna say, ""I think it's wacky. I think people need to go on their own and have the same thought process as this."
16,15,"Y'know, right? [NAP] [Sweet] **Sweet**!"
23,16,"OP, I read the title to be clear but I wasn't aware that wear masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it. A mask can't stop the virus, it's called a helmet. I know I'm not rapping, but I'm not sure that would be the proper title. The title should have been ""It's wacky. I wouldn't be scared of kids not getting vaccinated. """
24,16,I get that all the time. I don't like to wear a mask because I want to.
27,16,"I'm not sure what the story is with this, but the title is so accurate, it seems like it's really misleading. The title is a bit too long."
16,2,"ah, the epoch. i read this post a few days ago, i didn't realize it was like this."
16,5,“If you need to get vaccinated and want to get a savage cyborg mask then I would”
16,7,I don't want people to hear my comment because it makes me feel a bit out of place or it just makes it sound like that a lot of people can't cope.
16,9,I'm gonna say this too. I think people need to have a better time having a conversation about what is right and wrong. But I don't think you can have an honest conversation about whether you're right or wrong.
16,15,I was a lot older than I am and I've always known this guy and he always seems a bit like the clown.
23,16,">YOU can get vaccinated, you are one of the olympic champions. We are not immune. We are sick. You can get vaccinated, but we need to take a second look."
24,16,So he wants a woman to wear a mask and a man to wear a mask a few times a week and he wants to wear a mask but doesn't want to spit on her face and hiccup in her head? Doesn't he just want people to think he's better or better or better? Dose.
27,16,"So the rap idiocy is that you've never heard of rap in your life before? It's the ""The guy who wears a mask gets rapped in public and I'm really happy that his friend wears it."", it's an idiocy that you just do not know it's true. I don't think I can read the book and just let him put his face down, I don't think this would be too much of a rap idiocy."
16,2,That's the kind of thing a rap artist is referring to.
16,5,"The title... ""What a funny guy!"" is exactly how he gets his life going. This guy is a faggot."
16,7,>I don't want people to hear my comment because it makes me feel a bit out of place or it just makes it sound like that a lot of people can't cope.
16,9,This is the greatest thing in the history of the internet.
16,15, I think people need to go on their own and have the same thought process as this.
23,16,"The whole thing is a bit like the movie ""The Nightmare in the World"""
24,16,HAHA. How was the article?
27,16,"It's the fact that people can be very vulnerable to virus infection, which is one of the main reasons for this."
16,2,There's a lot more to this than just rap.
16,5,"i don't know if I'd really be uncomfortable with someone wearing a mask without a mask or not a mask, but the title...? [Nope.]"
16,7,I want to be blunt here.
16,9,"That sounds like something an adolescent will never be able to understand without a mask - it sounds like he just wants to make fun of people who are sick and have issues with their own skin. That's why people can be sick and sick with masks, even when they're not wearing a mask, even when they're not. He's trying to make people feel better with his own facial expressions."
16,15,"The world is going to be the worst place in the world for people to be so sick. You've never been to any epoch or been in a hive mind, but when you've seen the video and read it, you can't help but feel a little helpless. That's not a good way to live. That's a problem that's not being solved in your life."
23,16,"A little bit of the rap idiocy: Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
24,16,"It is all about getting out of your mask. What does a hiccup even mean? ''I have a mask a few times a week, I just can't get out''? ''Ooh, I don't wear it because I don't want to. ''It is the right thing to wear to do, but it is not what we can wear to get out of my head. ''That isn't what I want to wear to do. ''"
27,16,"I know people who wear masks, but I do not know what the title of the book is."
16,2,You're a lot older than I am and I've always known this guy and he always seems a bit like the clown.
16,5,"So, what does a hiccup even mean?"
16,7,"It's a bit like the movie ""The Nightmare in the World. It's the fact that people can be very vulnerable to virus infection. It's the fact that people can be very vulnerable to virus infection."
16,9,A little bit of the rap idiocy:
16,15,He's trying to make a joke about being the biggest faggot in the world. This guy is just getting into all the humor and making fun of people who aren't very funny. It's like rap and the video says he's trying to make it sound like he's better or better or better than anyone else.
23,16,There's a book about this that just seems like a bad idea. It is so much more about being a good dad that I don't understand why people do that.
24,16,I feel like this is going to be the top post.
27,16,"A friend of mine is rapping to my friends. She says ""I don't like seeing people do this in public. It helps me be safe. I'm gonna be going to a good rap festival and I will be happy that my friends and I aren't wearing the same mask."" and then she says ""I don't like seeing people do this in public. It helps me be safe. I'm gonna be going to a good rap festival and I will be happy that my friends and I aren't wearing a mask."", ""I'm"
