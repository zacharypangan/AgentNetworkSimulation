31,25,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
25,6,"As a person who has a terrible attitude towards racism in the past, if you are vaccinating children, you should wear a mask as much as you can."
25,10,"I never had a problem with wearing a mask, and I was going to ask if I should go in there and ask him if he should wear it. That would make me sad and he said I need to do the same."
25,12,"This is an awesome video. Do you love the dreaded, ugly santa masks?"
25,20,"yea, no, that would be ridiculous, but what about you?"
27,25,"OP, I read the title to be clear but I wasn't aware that wear masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
30,25,Another friendly reminder to vaccinate your kids wear a mask don t be racist and don t support d nald tr mp'.
31,25,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
25,6,"In all honesty, that's a great reminder to all my friends :)"
25,10,"They're ugly and all that, a lot of them. The one time I looked at santa's face I thought, 'what about you?' That was all I wanted, I didn't want to wear a mask, it looked ugly."
25,12,... so you are thinking about a santa mask that's a teddy bear?
25,20,I don't really like the ugly santa masks. I don't like the santa one.
27,25,A bit of the rap idiocy:
30,25,You seem to have an innate ignorance of the facts.
31,25,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
25,6,That's hilarious. If I was your friend you would revert to a rap idiocy.
25,10,"Then, take this. I'm gonna have a rap video about this."
25,12,"I don't like the santa one. A bit of the rap idiocy: You seem to have an innate ignorance of the facts. Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
25,20,I've seen this. It's just a pretty funny one!
27,25,> I'm gonna be going to a good rap festival and I will be happy that my friends and I aren't wearing the same mask.

25,10,This is just a pretty funny one!
25,12,"The thing is, I'm a very proud rapper. I never had a problem with wearing a mask and i was going to ask if I should go in there and ask him if he should wear it. That would make me sad and he said I need to do the same."
25,20,"In all honesty, that's a great reminder to all my friends :) They're ugly and all that, a lot of them. The one time I looked at santa's face I thought, 'what about you?' That was all I wanted, I didn't want to wear a mask, it looked ugly."
27,25,"I don't think this would be too much of a rap idiocy. I think it's just a rap idiocy to say that this is a great thing to say and i agree, you guys should read the book and just let this op put his face down, I'm a huge fan of rap, and the lyrics are very beautiful."
30,25,What a prick. I don't like nald trump. He's an idiot.
31,25,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
25,6,>What would make me sad and he said I need to do the same.
25,10,It's really funny. You should listen to it! It's rap idiocy.
25,12,"> ""I'm gonna be going to a good rap festival and I will be happy that my friends and I aren't wearing the same mask."
25,20,"What if it was me, the guy who said that the whole movie is a rap idiocy?"
27,25,"""I hate it."". [In my book that's the title, OP explains it.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RacingMasks)."
30,25,How did you not find out that I'm a Republican.
31,25,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
25,6,He's pretty much right about it.
25,10,"Then, take this. I'm gonna have a rap video about this. I don't like the santa one. A bit of the rap idiocy: You seem to have an innate ignorance of the facts. Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."

27,25,"""I hate it."" I think it's probably one of those times when the rap artist has to do a lot of things to prevent their peers from using masks. The person who makes the mistake might just want to stop wearing them. It's not like they want to do anything to stop rap from a certain place in the world. They're doing it to the people who love them and have been in a rut. ""I hate it."". I think it's probably one of those times when the rap artist has to do a lot of things to prevent their peers"
30,25,You are being fucked by people who are being fucked by people who are being fucked by people who don't know the facts.
31,25,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
25,6,I'm a little repressed when I tell people that I'm rapping and that it sucks when they're rapping and that if I don't wear a mask it isn't something I should wear. And when I tell people that they are rapping it isn't going to hurt themselves or anything.
25,10,"It's funny OP. It's so fucked up. It's a bit of an idiocy. I don't understand the whole ""why don't you go get some masks, or the lack of them?"" thing."
25,12,I've just read the article.
25,20,I'm not an idiot. I hate rap. I'm not an alcoholic.
27,25,I'm sorry that this shit gets downvoted.

25,12,I don't know why you would think so.
25,20,"It seems that this is the most common kind of rap idiocy around. The guy in the video said that he isn't a huge fan of the guy, but he's just kind of weird and makes me feel really old."
27,25,I'm sure he was confused because he has no idea how to write his own idiocy. You know what I mean?

25,12,That's a really interesting title for a post about what makes it interesting:
25,20,My wife and I went to the store and we all wore masks and it didn't work out. We were on vacation in the States. I've never seen an ugly santa before so I've been looking for one.
