27,22,huge covid fail to have santa not wearing a mask in thanksgivingdayparade would have been so powerful and such an endorsement of healthcareheroes wearamask
22,9,i was so happy to see a movie where the cops got all the wrong people because they were wrong. that's pretty awesome
22,17,They didn't have an excuse for that.
22,20,...and I've had a couple of days where the whole thing is literally a gif that I just don't understand. i guess the gif is just a really good video i see
27,22,i think it is also very important to remind you that a lot of these people are in the same situation as you are.
22,9,i just thought he was trying to say that cops didn't have an excuse for that. i was so happy to see a movie where the cops got all the wrong people because they were wrong. that's pretty awesome They didn't have an excuse for that.
22,17,"It explains why people who have been wearing masks don't have air conditioning. And even in the worst circumstances, the most dangerous people don't wear masks. I would go as far to say they didn't have an excuse for that."
22,20,This guy is one of the few people that makes it through a good period to feel like he's going through a hard time.
27,22,"Wow... I could've been so wrong. I've always been a fan of rap music. I've always been a fan of rap music. OP, I read the title to be clear but I wasn't aware that wear masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
22,9,"You're not wrong about having no air conditioning, but do you have that fucked up feeling of knowing people can't have air conditioning if you are just flying around in a puffy, snot filled space like a giant spider!"
22,17,"People just aren't in any danger. If someone wasn't wearing a mask in a public place, they aren't going to be safe in that situation."
22,20,i did not know this i had to get to know the guy and have a good conversation with him i got some good info.
27,22,I don't like seeing people do this in public. It helps me be safe. I'm gonna be going to a good rap festival and I will be happy that my friends and I aren't wearing the same mask.

22,9,"I like to say I don't understand what you're saying, but you've got to ask yourself how people do it, because that's exactly what you think people would think. You figured it out before you made the video."
22,17,"He is an alcoholic, a drug addict and a psychopath. Honestly, this guy is getting a lot of traction after reading this post, and he just doesn't seem to think he knows what he's talking about."

27,22,"I can't even imagine the feeling of being in a weird, ill-feeling, insecure place with this kind of person, he's not even that stupid."
22,9,"There are other, more powerful reasons to avoid wearing a mask. Some people don't want to deal with this kind of situation."
22,17,"OP, you read the title to be clear but I wasn't aware that wear masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it.

22,20,Is he wearing the mask for the first time and doesn't seem to be doing it for any other reason?
27,22,"I think it's probably one of those 'I think you guys should read the book and just let this op put his face down, I'm a huge fan of rap, and the lyrics are very beautiful."
22,9,"What kind of people are rapping at the start of the movie? If so, it's possible that a rap fan can't deal with a rap fan's discomfort at the first moment because he can't make it. I mean, I don't think anyone else will be able to tell you how rap and a drug addict will interact in a public place."
22,17,he's wearing the mask for the first time since march and doesn't seem to be doing it for any other reason?
22,20,"I've read a few things that you'd probably want to know about the whole topic, and oh I think you're referencing some other people in this post."
27,22,"""The person who makes the mistake might just want to stop wearing them."
22,9,>The person who makes the mistake might just want to stop wearing them.
22,17,This is the most shit I've ever read!
22,20,"Why not? They are the one of the few reasons that make a person so scared to rap. If he's not going to make it, he won't want to. He doesn't want to rap, he wants to be a rapper who is also a drug addict."
27,22,I'm not sure what the issue is but I guess it's more of a joke than an actual joke.
22,9,"You're not wrong about having no air conditioning, but do you have that fucked up feeling of knowing people can't have air conditioning if you are just flying around in a puffy, snot filled space like a giant spider?"
22,17,"i don't like wearing masks, but wearing my mask over my nose and snot is just an excuse."
22,20,He's a rap fan. You shouldn't be sleeping around with a guy who's scared of it.
27,22,"I don't know if I understand the comment, but I don't think the title is misleading and he seems like he should have commented on the book."
22,9,"I'd like to say that I've heard that if you're going to a rap festival, don't you think it's worth going? Especially if you're the type of guy that raps and has a rapping crush, like it is, it's really fun to go."
22,17,">He is an alcoholic, a drug addict and a psychopath. Honestly, this guy is getting a lot of traction after reading this post, and he just doesn't seem to think he knows what he's talking about."
22,20,"OP, you read the title to be clear but I wasn't aware that wear masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
27,22,I read the book (because the title is misleading) and he said the same thing. And the rap idiocy is pretty funny.
22,9,"I've heard that a lot of people get scared of rap because they are so reliant on their own abilities. It isn't that I have to agree with him on something, but I do agree with u/DynamicRap. And I've heard that the most dangerous rap is when it goes out to party with your friends, and that even if you don't do rap, you won't be able to keep going, or get away from the crowd."

OP, you read the title to be clear but I wasn't aware that wear masks does not help in stopping the virus. Some people don't want to deal with this kind of situation."
22,20,It sounds like it's a good idea to get off the internet and not get into rap festivals just for the fun of it.
