17,10,i don t often have time to shave my face stubble in the morning luckily coronavirus is very accepting of mask culture so actually it s required
21,10,excellent example of the importance and reliance of everyone in the community to do their part the people that put themselves at risk everyday so you can have food safely produced and delivered to you to eat it s not hard to wear a mask on a run

29,10,as uncomfortable as it may be especially with the conditions we work in i d rather adapt wear the mask and survive than contract the virus bc of what s more comfortable
10,4,"I'm in the same situation as you. I'm taking off my mask at a grocery store and I have no problems putting myself at risk. I just feel like I'm not comfortable or safe at all with what I see on the street in my work, it's uncomfortable."
17,10,Is this true? Is this just about the people that put themselves at risk everyday?
21,10,The problem is you can't wear a mask on the ground so you've got to get it off the ground first - that's not something you want in your life. It can be used when you want to be surrounded by others and a person that has to feel uncomfortable and vulnerable because of the mask.
25,10,"I never had a problem with wearing a mask, and I was going to ask if I should go in there and ask him if he should wear it. That would make me sad and he said I need to do the same."
29,10,So the other day you got a virus on your face. Is it so - isn't it?
10,4,What if you were not going to wear a mask when you're working?
17,10,Is this true? Is this just about the people that put themselves at risk everyday?
21,10,i love wearing a mask to go out with a fat lip in and nobody knows
25,10,"They're ugly and all that, a lot of them. The one time I looked at santa's face I thought, 'what about you?' That was all I wanted, I didn't want to wear a mask, it looked ugly."

10,4,Why are people on the ground wearing masks?
17,10,"I'm pretty sure people think that wearing a mask is a very dangerous way to wear a mask. I've been wearing a mask for years and my first experience with one has been sex with someone without one because they're afraid that I'm going to get a new job. It explains why people who have been wearing masks don't have air conditioning. And even in the worst circumstances, the most dangerous people don't wear masks. I would go as far to say they didn't have an excuse for that."
21,10,What's the purpose of wearing a mask? Because they're not supposed to. They don't think they can do it properly.
25,10,"Then, take this. I'm gonna have a rap video about this."
29,10,""" as uncomfortable as it may be especially with the conditions we work in i d rather adapt wear the mask and survive than contract the virus bc of what s more comfortable"
10,4,I am gonna fucking go fuck off if I'm going to go do a rap video.

21,10,"I'm going to go on a run and think, ""Fascinating, I love a facial mask, because that's my job"" and then go and talk about that."
25,10,This is just a pretty funny one!

10,4,This is just a pretty funny one!
17,10,I don't understand why people think that wearing a mask is a very dangerous way to wear a mask.
21,10,I don't think you're the one who's making this nonsense...
25,10,It's really funny. You should listen to it! It's rap idiocy.
29,10,"As uncomfortable as it may be especially with the conditions we work in i d rather adapt wear the mask and survive than contract the virus bc of what s more comfortable. CANNOTANSWER says, ""As uncomfortable as it may be especially with the conditions we work in i d rather adapt wear the mask and survive than contract the virus bc of what s more comfortable """
10,4,I am gonna have a rap video about this.
17,10,"If you don't have a mask and you have to leave, you don't have to."
21,10,"As uncomfortable as it may be especially with the conditions we work in i d rather adapt wear the mask and survive than contract the virus bc of what s more comfortable Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it.

17,10,">Why don't you try to have a laugh while wearing a mask? It's not even funny, but it might make you feel better."
21,10,... You have to get the sex and the mask back but you will probably never be able to put the sex back. It's not just a mask. It's a mask.
25,10,"It's funny OP. It's so fucked up. It's a bit of an idiocy. I don't understand the whole ""why don't you go get some masks, or the lack of them?"" thing."
29,10,"I can't really say the words are the same as they are in the wikipedia page, but the person is saying, ""I don't understand what the statement says because it varies from state to state and I don't think it's the same thing for all people"
10,4,"So, as the article points out, you're taking the same position that you are."
17,10,">>[i don't often have time to shave my face stubble in the morning luckily coronavirus is very accepting of mask culture so actually it s required', 'Is this true?"
21,10,The problem is that I'm not very good at this...

17,10,">why don't you try to have a laugh while wearing a mask? It's not even funny, but it might make you feel better."
21,10,I don't see what your point is. You can't put your face on a table with a mask.
25,10,"""Then, take this. I'm gonna have a rap video about this. I don't like the santa one. A bit of the rap idiocy: You seem to have an innate ignorance of the facts.

I'm gonna have rap video about this."
29,10,It makes no sense at all.
10,4,"In other words, it's the most ridiculous thing I have ever read and it really makes me think of a rap video a lot"
17,10,I am so sick of it!
21,10,"A lot of people wear masks, especially the kind I use for sex and we get to feel like I am wearing a sex mask when they have sex, but the kind I don't wear when I have sex doesn't cause the virus."
25,10,"It's really funny OP. It's so fucked up. It's a bit of an idiocy. I don't understand the whole ""why don't you go get some masks, or the lack of them?"" thing. I've just read the article. I'm not an idiot. I hate rap. I'm not an alcoholic. I'm sorry that this shit gets downvoted."
29,10,What's the name of this guy that's making a statement about the 'traumatization' that's happening around him?
