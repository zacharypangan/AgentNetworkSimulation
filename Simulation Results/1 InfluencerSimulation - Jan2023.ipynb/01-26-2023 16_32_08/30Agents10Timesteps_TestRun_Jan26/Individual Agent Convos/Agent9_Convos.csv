16,9,please leep your mask on i don t want you to be taken out by a virus that is not gone
22,9,i flew for the first time since march it was mostly fine but some folks wore their masks as chin slings i have glasses and wore my mask over my nose for hours and they didn t fog up i also had plenty of oxygen over the nose people
28,9,really interesting in light of people s resistance to wear a mask both the mask and the shopping cart are measurements of empathy
29,9,as uncomfortable as it may be especially with the conditions we work in i d rather adapt wear the mask and survive than contract the virus bc of what s more comfortable
9,8,I don't care to put a mask on when I go in for a job interview.

16,9,hey i'm sorry but this idiocracy in my head i am so sick of the whole joke 
22,9,i was so happy to see a movie where the cops got all the wrong people because they were wrong. that's pretty awesome
28,9,"I can not help it either, but it does help stop it."

9,8,I'm so sick of the whole joke i'm so sick of the whole joke i'm so sick of the whole joke
13,9,"Hey, you're funny! This is really a good question to ask."
16,9,I think he's actually trying to be humorous and he sounds like he's trying to tell you that he's in a joke to make it look good but that the joke isn't real
22,9,i just thought he was trying to say that cops didn't have an excuse for that. i was so happy to see a movie where the cops got all the wrong people because they were wrong. that's pretty awesome They didn't have an excuse for that.
28,9,"It sounds like you are thinking of a narcissist, who was also the author of The Man Who Cries, and who thinks this is a good idea? Its a movie that started it all and had no meaning."
29,9,i don't understand the statement
9,8,"The joke is not funny. He's trying to be funny, but it's the wrong thing to think. The joke is so far off that I don't know where it comes from. I'm pretty sure it's just a joke that the person doesn't actually care about themselves. But if you're not into him being funny, you shouldn't be in his place for his idiocy. It's kinda like when people are portrayed as narcissists and want to be safe. You might like that."
13,9,i just swore by that I would wear a mask once in a while and then I stopped wearing them because I thought I was the only one who could say that and then I went home.
16,9,"It's an idiocracy in my head that makes it look silly, but I think that he just wants to make fun of people who are sick and have issues with their own skin / adolescence. The fact that he is trying to be funny is what makes it a joke."
22,9,"You're not wrong about having no air conditioning, but do you have that fucked up feeling of knowing people can't have air conditioning if you are just flying around in a puffy, snot filled space like a giant spider!"
28,9,Is there any specific person who can think of someone who doesn't want to wear a mask when they want to be alone or not? I am going to have to ask myself how I would feel about someone who wears masks. That's something I can never really figure out in my head.
29,9,"I don't understand the statement, I've come to accept that I can be uncomfortable."
9,8,"> ""Hey, you're funny! This is really a good question to ask. I think he's actually trying to be humorous and he sounds like he's trying to tell you that he's in a joke to make it look good but that the joke isn't real"

16,9,"""I think you are not immune. We are sick. You can get vaccinated, but we need to take a second look."
22,9,"I like to say I don't understand what you're saying, but you've got to ask yourself how people do it, because that's exactly what you think people would think. You figured it out before you made the video."
28,9,"OP, this is a great story. I think people should come back and have a discussion about it, because it has been covered in this article before. I'm going to make sure I understand why this is going to be the top post, because it's just what it is."
29,9,I've never been uncomfortable with this kind of experience... And that's why i say 'as uncomfortable as it may be especially with the conditions we work in i d rather adapt wear the mask and survive than contract the virus bc of what s more comfortable '
9,8,I don't think I've ever had the privilege of seeing a doctor in my life or being able to get vaccinated. I am not that good.
13,9,"How would you feel about that? If you’re wearing a mask on your BF, you should definitely think about a different mask if you don’t want to wear it."
16,9,"IANAL, but that is not the only way to get vaccinated in public. I’d like to say that the best way to deal with the virus is to wear a mask and not get a savage cyborg mask."
22,9,"There are other, more powerful reasons to avoid wearing a mask. Some people don't want to deal with this kind of situation."
28,9,">I think the first part of the article is really helpful and makes an important point: Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
29,9,As uncomfortable as it may be especially with the conditions we work in i d rather adapt wear the mask and survive than contract the virus bc of what s more comfortable
9,8,I know what you mean... I've never been able to stand wearing a mask on my husband.
13,9,The question is: What is the difference between wearing a mask and having a dog that is being made to wear a mask?
16,9,"I am gonna say, ""I think it's wacky. I think people need to go on their own and have the same thought process as this."
22,9,"What kind of people are rapping at the start of the movie? If so, it's possible that a rap fan can't deal with a rap fan's discomfort at the first moment because he can't make it. I mean, I don't think anyone else will be able to tell you how rap and a drug addict will interact in a public place."
28,9,"I'm on mobile, I'm so addicted to the internet."
29,9,I don't understand what the statement says because it varies from state to state and I don't think it's the same thing for all people
9,8,"I think the first part of the article is really helpful and makes an important point: Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
13,9,> You can wear a mask and then give them a mask and then go home. You can wear a mask but you will not be wearing it anymore.
16,9,I'm gonna say this too. I think people need to have a better time having a conversation about what is right and wrong. But I don't think you can have an honest conversation about whether you're right or wrong.
22,9,>The person who makes the mistake might just want to stop wearing them.
28,9,It's actually not that bad. And when you're on mobile you know that you're not wearing any masks. And when you're on the internet you're wearing a mask.
29,9,Is that all the other posts of yours?
9,8,"This is a great article. I think people should come back and have a discussion about it, because it has been covered in this article before."
13,9,"> I actually thought it was funny that she's wearing a mask to get the hat off her shoulder if she wants to go.... and then a special shout out goes to Ms. Latorre we loved the teachable moment of mask wearing and addressing covid questions also a very happy birthday to our vebbulldog jamya', ""Hey, you're funny! This is really a good question to ask."""
16,9,This is the greatest thing in the history of the internet.
22,9,"You're not wrong about having no air conditioning, but do you have that fucked up feeling of knowing people can't have air conditioning if you are just flying around in a puffy, snot filled space like a giant spider?"
28,9,"I'd like to be the first person to be aware that 'The Man Who Cries' is a very 'interesting and interesting' book. I would say that while I know that the book is the 'interesting' one, it's a little different from ""the Man Who Cries""; it's about an extremely difficult and dangerous virus, and the one that happens to occur in a group of strangers when they visit the same group as the other person."
29,9,It's interesting that people are attempting to say something sexist because of the amount of 'traumatization' that they're making about the work environment.
9,8,I'm sorry that you are getting downvoted. You are a rabid animal rights activist. It's not okay to be criticized for making a joke about yourself.
13,9,"This movie seems pretty ridiculous. But what if you see a mask, it’s a big deal and they will give you the full answer. It’s also a big deal."
16,9,"That sounds like something an adolescent will never be able to understand without a mask - it sounds like he just wants to make fun of people who are sick and have issues with their own skin. That's why people can be sick and sick with masks, even when they're not wearing a mask, even when they're not. He's trying to make people feel better with his own facial expressions."
22,9,"I'd like to say that I've heard that if you're going to a rap festival, don't you think it's worth going? Especially if you're the type of guy that raps and has a rapping crush, like it is, it's really fun to go."
28,9,And when you're on the internet you're wearing a mask.
29,9,"So you said ""as uncomfortable as it may be especially with the conditions we work in i d rather adapt wear the mask and survive than contract the virus of what s more comfortable. """
9,8,"[The rapping virus doesn't cause you to rap, and the use of masks as an excuse for being sexually assaulted is one of my top favorite jokes.](http://www.reddit.com/r/RapidFakeNews/FakeNews/FakeNews). This is the reason rap is such an important topic for our society."
13,9,"ahhhhh. That's the kind of thing that you want to be able to wear. unless a person has it with him (and his dog can't get it with him if he has to wear a mask). It's not even a thing to consider. It's not like it's a problem, it's just a thing."
16,9,A little bit of the rap idiocy:
22,9,"I've heard that a lot of people get scared of rap because they are so reliant on their own abilities. It isn't that I have to agree with him on something, but I do agree with u/DynamicRap. And I've heard that the most dangerous rap is when it goes out to party with your friends, and that even if you don't do rap, you won't be able to keep going, or get away from the crowd."
28,9,I don't know that I actually liked the film.
29,9,When you get to the point where the word is 'confirming' it is a quote that contradicts the line. The same line eludes me.
