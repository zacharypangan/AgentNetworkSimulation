18,14,hey i just saw you are running miles across florida right now curious if you would share what is the route im in orlando and would love to come run with you even if just for a mile i d wear a mask and keep distance
27,18,huge covid fail to have santa not wearing a mask in thanksgivingdayparade would have been so powerful and such an endorsement of healthcareheroes wearamask
28,18,really interesting in light of people s resistance to wear a mask both the mask and the shopping cart are measurements of empathy
18,14,"Why not just go with me? I don't know santa, but I would not mind if he was wearing a mask"
27,18,This isn't funny enough :) but I thought wearing a mask would have been pretty useful and useful to people.
28,18,So I just swore by that I would wear a mask once in a while and then I stopped wearing them because I thought I was the only one who could say that and then I went home.
18,14,"I hate to say it but I like the idea of santa being a santa, and having a mask for the fun. I feel like I'm the only one who can't agree with you if he's wearing a mask."
27,18,You must be so tired to be reading this. The only good thing I can say about this is I don't like seeing people do this in public. It helps me be safe. I'm gonna be going to a good rap festival and I will be happy that my friends and I aren't wearing the same mask. I think we're doing okay but I can't help but notice how bad people are.
28,18,So you cried because of this movie?
18,14,There was a scene where the crowd of people cried for no apparent reason.
27,18,Definitely not a bad idea I would never have gotten in the mood for one in a day with a huge covid who didn't wear a mask. The name of the band is not funny enough. The song makes a lot of sense. It's called A Nightmare in the World. You must be so tired to be reading this. The only good thing I can say about this is I don't like seeing people do this in public. It helps me be safe. I'm gonna be going to a good rap festival and I'm
28,18,"I don't think it's too funny. But that's only the first part. I really thought this movie was really important, that they were trying to push me towards wearing the mask and that there's no way I could stop them."
18,14,I've done this for a few years. It's not about the humor but the fact that the whole thing makes me so sad.
27,18,"If you're not wearing a mask, you're going to a bad rap festival, and you need to stop."
28,18,People who don't wear masks because they feel like they're wearing a mask when they're alone or not?
18,14,I'm still wearing a mask when I'm out. So I'm not at the mall. My friend and I are both in the mall.
27,18,Wow... I could've been so wrong. I've always been a fan of rap music. I've always been a fan of rap music.
28,18,I haven't read the full article. I'm going to have to find it now.
18,14,That is really scary. What if people don't even have a real place to run?
27,18,I can't believe that this guy is going to get rapped for some reason. I can't believe that rapped as well.
28,18,[The article is pretty much a compilation of articles in this subreddit. It doesn't have a lot of links on it.

27,18,">A bit of the rap idiocy: Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
28,18,Is this the same story I was reading about a guy who wears masks but is afraid of dressing up in a mask while he's alone?
18,14,It's the most dangerous and terrible thing I've ever read about the rap scene.
27,18,"""The best thing they could do was help their victim rap in some way."
28,18,"I'd have read the full article before deciding to read it here, because the title just makes me think that the virulent hiccup is a mental health concern, and I have a similar feeling."
18,14,It's a shame. It's a shame that there's no point in letting this people get too caught up. I think I've always been a fan of rap music.
27,18,"It's actually more like rap. Considering that the term is used by some people in everyday life, it's pretty clear that you don't wear a mask."
28,18,"I thought it was a great book, but I didn't think it was that good."
18,14,"In the middle of the movie is the ""A Nightmare in the World"": It's called a ""Patriotic Hypnotherapy"" and is a satire of the rap scene. It's pretty sure that's exactly how it started."
27,18,"""I love you, I'm so sorry I raped you."""
