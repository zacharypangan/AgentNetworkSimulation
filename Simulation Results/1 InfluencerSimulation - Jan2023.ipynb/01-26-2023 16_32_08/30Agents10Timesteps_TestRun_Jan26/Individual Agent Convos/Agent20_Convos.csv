21,20,excellent example of the importance and reliance of everyone in the community to do their part the people that put themselves at risk everyday so you can have food safely produced and delivered to you to eat it s not hard to wear a mask on a run

27,20,huge covid fail to have santa not wearing a mask in thanksgivingdayparade would have been so powerful and such an endorsement of healthcareheroes wearamask
31,20,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
20,7,"In Florida, there is a tinfoil vaccine and that's just one of many medications that help stop the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
20,14,i am just gonna tell you something about the people that put themselves at risk everyday so you can have food safely produced and delivered to you to eat
20,15,"I have had this happen to me. It's great, and I'm just a little upset that people in this country are taking a stand."
21,20,It’s not too much to ask for more. It’s just going to be hard to fit in for longer than that.
22,20,...and I've had a couple of days where the whole thing is literally a gif that I just don't understand. i guess the gif is just a really good video i see
25,20,"yea, no, that would be ridiculous, but what about you?"

27,20,This is a pretty much the only reason I’m not wearing a mask because I don’t know where to look. It’s probably because my face is a little too warm to have a full blown apologist on hand - I guess I’m just trying to make sure to avoid the virus.
31,20,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
20,7,"oh man, i troll every troll on reddit."

20,15,A fucking fucking man. I'm sorry but I don't believe the truth.
21,20,I want to tell you this:
22,20,This guy is one of the few people that makes it through a good period to feel like he's going through a hard time.
25,20,I don't really like the ugly santa masks. I don't like the santa one.
26,20,I'm sure the guy with the fat lip in doesn't know what he's talking about.
27,20,OP is a great read...
31,20,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
20,7,I'm still working on the vaccine in my head right now.
20,14,">""I'm so sorry mark but i don't trust this vaccine i understand your concern for the residents of erie county i obey the mask mandate wash and sterilize my hands when returning home from work and elsewhere',"
20,15,It's the only reason why people on this sub aren't wearing masks. They're just an excuse to be afraid of what they can't get away with.
21,20,This isn't a joke at all. It's a joke.
22,20,i did not know this i had to get to know the guy and have a good conversation with him i got some good info.
25,20,I've seen this. It's just a pretty funny one!
26,20,"Yeah... I mean, I've never been in public with a fat lip in. But I do like wearing them because they have an excellent sense of smell and it's good to look good. But I'm afraid you guys can't see the difference unless you wear them as soon as possible."
27,20,You don't have to be a huge fan of rap music to wear a mask.
31,20,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
20,7,That's one of many reasons why people on this sub aren't wearing masks. They're just an excuse to be afraid of what they can't get away with.
20,14,Why do you think you're a huge fan of rap music?
20,15,"I just wanted to yell at you for saying it but I don't want to make that sound like a big deal. I can see why people would put their face under the mask if they were gonna do it. But yea, I really don't think you can do it. Y'know, OP is the kind of person that'll change it for you if you don't wear a mask."
21,20,"There's a little bit of a r/AssociatePerson rant there, but it does look like the entire episode is a little bit too heavy."
22,20,I don't like seeing people do this in public. It helps me be safe. I'm gonna be going to a good rap festival and I will be happy that my friends and I aren't wearing the same mask. You must be so tired to be reading this.
25,20,"In all honesty, that's a great reminder to all my friends :) They're ugly and all that, a lot of them. The one time I looked at santa's face I thought, 'what about you?' That was all I wanted, I didn't want to wear a mask, it looked ugly."
26,20,I just wanted to say that it's pretty cool that I'm a woman with a problem with self-esteem. This seems like a perfect metaphor for a woman with a problem with her self-esteem.
27,20,"""Make a mask to wear it with me."""
31,20,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
20,7,"I'm a little tired, but I'm just tired. I have to leave rap music a little later, so rap is a whole different beast."
20,14,"I read the same thing and realised I was just going to put up with my husband's idea of what's good for your skin. So I swore to myself that the guy in the post was going to tell me that, but I did not say ""you have to be a huge fan of rap music."""
20,15,"It seems like a perfect metaphor for a woman with a problem with her self-esteem. ""Make a mask to wear it with me."""
21,20,[This isn't a joke at all. It's a joke. This sounds like a perfect metaphor for a woman with a problem with her self-esteem.
22,20,Is he wearing the mask for the first time and doesn't seem to be doing it for any other reason?
25,20,"What if it was me, the guy who said that the whole movie is a rap idiocy?"
26,20,A sex mask is what makes you comfortable and a sex mask is the only option to keep your skin moist. It's like wearing a new pair of jeans or a new pair of sunglasses.
27,20,"It's not as bad as rap music, but it's also a fun song, if it's played with the lyrics. The lyrics are very beautiful."

20,7,...and why is it a joke?

21,20,"* ""As uncomfortable as it may be especially with the conditions we work in i d rather adapt wear the mask and survive than contract the virus, it's useless and I hate it. What's the purpose of wearing a mask? Because they're not supposed to. They don't think they can do it properly. I'm going to say it's very scary and scary that I'm going to get a new job, and it's incredibly terrifying. It's also very uncomfortable to be exposed to a mask, and you can have a laugh"
22,20,"I've read a few things that you'd probably want to know about the whole topic, and oh I think you're referencing some other people in this post."
25,20,"Then, take this. I'm gonna have a rap video about this. I don't like the ugly santa masks. A bit of the rap idiocy: You seem to have an innate ignorance of the facts. Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it. I've seen this. It's just a pretty funny one!"

21,20,It's not funny when you don't think it's funny.
22,20,"Why not? They are the one of the few reasons that make a person so scared to rap. If he's not going to make it, he won't want to. He doesn't want to rap, he wants to be a rapper who is also a drug addict."

22,20,He's a rap fan. You shouldn't be sleeping around with a guy who's scared of it.
25,20,"This has got to be a little bit more ironic, because it's basically a way to teach you people that I'm not an idiot."
26,20,You have to wear a sex mask in the middle of a meeting to make sure your sex mask is there.
