26,21,i like wearing a mask because i can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows
29,21,as uncomfortable as it may be especially with the conditions we work in i d rather adapt wear the mask and survive than contract the virus bc of what s more comfortable
31,21,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
21,10,The problem is you can't wear a mask on the ground so you've got to get it off the ground first - that's not something you want in your life. It can be used when you want to be surrounded by others and a person that has to feel uncomfortable and vulnerable because of the mask.
21,17,It's good to be around people who don't need to wear a mask to run.
21,20,It’s not too much to ask for more. It’s just going to be hard to fit in for longer than that.
26,21,"I have never been in public with a fat lip in. I can tell that I'm having a fun time without one, though."

21,10,i love wearing a mask to go out with a fat lip in and nobody knows
21,17,I'm pretty sure people think that wearing a mask is a very dangerous way to wear a mask. I've been wearing a mask for years and my first experience with one has been sex with someone without one because they're afraid that I'm going to get a new job.
21,20,I want to tell you this:
26,21,I can see the mask in my face.

31,21,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
21,10,What's the purpose of wearing a mask? Because they're not supposed to. They don't think they can do it properly.
21,17,"As someone who has been exposed to the virus for years, I'm going to say it's very scary and scary that I'm going to get a new job, and it's incredibly terrifying. It's also very uncomfortable to be exposed to it, and I don't think it's dangerous to be exposed to a new virus, which isn't as scary. I don't think it's too dangerous, but it's very dangerous."
21,20,This isn't a joke at all. It's a joke.
26,21,This sounds like a perfect metaphor for a woman with a problem with her self-esteem.
29,21,So... what? Is that all the other post of yours?

21,17,"Why don't you try to have a laugh while wearing a mask? It's not even funny, but it might make you feel better."
21,20,"There's a little bit of a r/AssociatePerson rant there, but it does look like the entire episode is a little bit too heavy."
26,21,"I always like wearing a mask because of my skin type. The fatties are fun! A little bit of it. I love to wear a sex mask because I think I look nice, and I know I don't want to be in public.

21,17,I've worn a mask and it has made me feel better. You are doing an amazing job. You have to get the sex and the mask back but you will probably never be able to put the sex back. It's not just a mask. It's a mask.

29,21,I think I read that all the other people here are saying as uncomfortable as it may be especially with the conditions we work in and this one is being eloquent.
31,21,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."

21,20,It's not funny when you don't think it's funny.

21,10,The problem is that I'm not very good at this...

21,20,I can't help but feel a little uncomfortable when I'm wearing a mask on my own...
26,21,"I can’t believe this is a racial stereotype, but it is a valid point of view for many people. It would probably be more difficult to get out of my nose if I went out in public with a fat lip in. Then, why do you wear a sex mask?

29,21,It makes no sense at all.
31,21,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
21,10,I don't see what your point is. You can't put your face on a table with a mask.
21,17,What is the purpose of a mask? Because they're not supposed to. They don't think they can do it properly.
21,20,... you don't think that makes sense.
26,21,">I love wearing a sex mask, but I also really dislike sex masks, I can't stand wearing a sex mask on my head. My husband likes them because they're fun, I'm nice, and I'm super sensitive. It's just like wearing a sex mask."
29,21,And CANNOTANSWER is using this same line in a way that makes no sense at all.
31,21,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
21,10,"A lot of people wear masks, especially the kind I use for sex and we get to feel like I am wearing a sex mask when they have sex, but the kind I don't wear when I have sex doesn't cause the virus."
