24,13,"I am a man. I get that all the time. I don't like to wear a mask because I want to, but it's just a matter of time before I get sick of wearing a mask. And I don't think I will be more effective than the others. But i still don't feel good at it. I just feel better knowing the better. It's just something I learned to do."
28,13,You can wear a mask but you will not be wearing the mask anymore.

24,13,I am sorry to say I can't see how it would be an easy job. There's really a lot of cynicism about it. You can't change it but it will still happen. Please wear a mask and then give them a mask and then go home.

13,9,"How would you feel about that? If you’re wearing a mask on your BF, you should definitely think about a different mask if you don’t want to wear it."
24,13,I cried about it yesterday when I finally broke down.
28,13,"I think the first part is really helpful and makes an important point: Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
13,4,Yes. I'm a man with a bit of the brittle phobia.

13,4,"I can't understand a guy with a brittle phobia without some type of anti-toxin. So i just like it. And i can't stop crying about it, and that's my only thing to know. Besides, my gf isn't great at sex and doesn't really understand what the difference is. But he will understand that if you want a mask, wear a mask, but if he can't see the difference in the face, it's really hard to accept the change. It"

24,13,oh my. Ouch.

24,13,I read the title of the post after reading the title of the article.
28,13,This is going to be a very interesting story. I think people should come back and have a discussion about it. Is this the same story I was reading about a guy who wears masks but is afraid of dressing up in a mask while he's alone?

13,9,"ahhhhh. That's the kind of thing that you want to be able to wear. unless a person has it with him (and his dog can't get it with him if he has to wear a mask). It's not even a thing to consider. It's not like it's a problem, it's just a thing."
24,13,"What a jerk. I like to have my self image distorted as a face hiccup, and you like to get out of your mask?"
28,13,The 'interesting' part isn't what it is. It's that people are being so snarky about a novel because it has so little substance that it would make them resentful of it.
