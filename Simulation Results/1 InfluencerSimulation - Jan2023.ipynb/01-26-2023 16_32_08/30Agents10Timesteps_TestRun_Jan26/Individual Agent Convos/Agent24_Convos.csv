24,16,please wear a mask amp bend over
28,24,really interesting in light of people s resistance to wear a mask both the mask and the shopping cart are measurements of empathy
24,2,I don't see how that would be an easy job. There's really a lot of cynicism about it. You can't change it but it will still happen.
24,13,Please wear a mask amp bend over please wear a mask amp bend over please wear a mask amp bend over
24,16,I agree with that. But it doesn't seem like you actually want to wear a mask. Do you think you will be more effective at it?
28,24,"The fact that this is going to be the top post is a warning that is the right way to take action, but I don't think the other comments speak to that"
24,2,And thats why you wear a mask?
24,13,Please wear a mask amp bend over please wear a mask amp bend over please wear a mask amp bend over I think that's not what you want to hear.
24,16,"I think people need to go on their own and have the same thought process as this. I haven't done that, but I'm going to have to ask myself if there are other people out there who want to wear a mask and then give them a mask and then go home."
28,24,I am still trying to figure out how to stop the virulent hiccup in people.
24,2,I have the same problem. When I wear a mask it hurts. And when I do I think I can't see how it will be an easy job. I'm unable to make a positive change.
24,13,"I am a man. I get that all the time. I don't like to wear a mask because I want to, but it's just a matter of time before I get sick of wearing a mask. And I don't think I will be more effective than the others. But i still don't feel good at it. I just feel better knowing the better. It's just something I learned to do."
24,16,"I don't have a mask. I don't wear a mask. I don't wear it as I am not working out. I am unable to walk for a while without getting a hiccup. I don't understand why people should wear a mask if they don't like wearing it, and what the point of wearing a mask in your head is."
28,24,"I don't know what a virulent hiccup is, but the fact that the list of comments is up there means you're missing the part where the article was a little short on facts. That's why I read it."
24,2,"I do a lot of work as a doctor, and as a doctor, I am very aware that my doctor does not have a clue what I'm talking about and that I would never do anything I said without consulting a physician."
24,13,I am sorry to say I can't see how it would be an easy job. There's really a lot of cynicism about it. You can't change it but it will still happen. Please wear a mask and then give them a mask and then go home.
24,16,oh man. what are you doing with the hiccup?
28,24,I think the first part of the article is really helpful and makes an important point:
24,2,What did you do before wearing a mask?
24,13,I cried about it yesterday when I finally broke down.
24,16,In my opinion it's a lot easier to just wear a mask for fun. I spit on my skin and I am sore - and the rest of my body isn't coping well. But I can still be able to move a limb or face through it. I don't want people to see that if I do wear a mask I don't want people to think I would be better.
28,24,"The virulent hiccup is a mental health concern, and I have a similar feeling."
24,2,I would wear a mask and say “I don’t wear it because I want to.” I wouldn’t say “I don’t want people to see that if I do wear a mask I don’t want people to think I would be better.”
24,13,"I'm going to tell you something, but what is the point? If it doesn't make you feel better, you're a jerk."
24,16,I get that all the time. I don't like to wear a mask because I want to.
28,24,"I feel like this movie is going to become very popular. I thought it was great, but it never actually did."
24,2,"If that's what you want, how you want to change things. If you want to change a thing, just go."
24,13,oh my. Ouch.
24,16,So he wants a woman to wear a mask and a man to wear a mask a few times a week and he wants to wear a mask but doesn't want to spit on her face and hiccup in her head? Doesn't he just want people to think he's better or better or better? Dose.
28,24,"OP, this is a great story. I think people should come back and have a discussion about it, because it has been covered in this article before. I'm going to make sure I understand why this is going to be the top post, because it's just what it is. You can wear a mask but you will not be wearing it anymore. People who don't wear masks because they feel like they're wearing a mask when they're alone or not? Then I'd read some of this post."
24,2,'Here's how he got the link.
24,13,> I don't want people to see that if I do wear a mask I don't want people to think I would be better
24,16,HAHA. How was the article?
28,24,"> I'm on mobile, I'm so addicted to the internet."
24,2,"OP, the first part of this article is really helpful and makes an important point: What did you do before wearing a mask?"
24,13,I read the title of the post after reading the title of the article.
24,16,"It is all about getting out of your mask. What does a hiccup even mean? ''I have a mask a few times a week, I just can't get out''? ''Ooh, I don't wear it because I don't want to. ''It is the right thing to wear to do, but it is not what we can wear to get out of my head. ''That isn't what I want to wear to do. ''"
28,24,"I am on mobile, I'm so addicted to the internet."
24,2,I have a hiccup with no mask.
24,13,"What a jerk. I like to have my self image distorted as a face hiccup, and you like to get out of your mask?"
24,16,I feel like this is going to be the top post.
28,24,I read the title to remind me what a mask is.
