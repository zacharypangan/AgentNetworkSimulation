41,37,Even with a mask on coaching baseball practice this morning on a beautiful almost fall day was incredibly refreshing this guy is garbage and utah needs to get rid of him gitmo would be a good place for him gop sen mitt romney votes with democrats to keep masks mandate for toddlers
43,37,I’m going to go buy you a gun.
47,37,i think i'm a bit weird for having a face mask on.
48,37,IANAL but I would ask if anyone I see who doesn't wear a mask is wearing a mask for a flight on the job.
1,37,I'm gonna get on that side. I just drew a picture of myself reeking a huge awe of a mask on coaching baseball practice today. Especially when you remember how it was a beautiful day.
12,37,I'm not sure what you mean by 'even with a mask on coaching baseball practice this morning on a beautiful almost fall day was incredibly refreshing'.
20,37,"Oh, I'm not even a voter, but my friend who's a Democrat, wears a mask for his political campaigns. That's all there is to it."
28,37,Why don't you just wear a mask outside while vaccinated to prevent it?
29,37,i have to say the first two digits of the vaccinated code should be the first to say that
31,37,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
36,37,"Wait a damn min we gotta wear mask while working out at the gym i did this with one lone mask less man in a ballot recount center says the woman that wears the mask to protect herself lmao well dear the gun works the mask doesn't i m wearing a mask outside while vaccinated because people like you are in my face why does it bother you to the point that you are asking random people why they are doing something that makes them feel safe Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus,"
37,2,So I just thought it was a good idea to wear a mask while working out at the gym. Why is that not so important? It's the only way for it to work and there's no other way to make a difference when people are talking to people.

40,37,"[Billy White](https://www.nih.gov/news/events/events/events/events/events) is pretty shady and funny.

41,37,"You're going to have to get rid of him, it's not funny."
43,37,"The people who think of that aren't a threat to the public are probably a danger to the public. But that doesn't mean that the government should not be involved in this ordeal, but that if a group of people isn't involved in this ordeal they should be concerned about their safety, and not just to the public.''"
47,37,Is there a good reason to wear a mask to prevent it from happening?
48,37,"I think it's an important point that everyone should have a right to wear a mask, but if everyone wanted to, there are very very many other issues that can be overcome by wearing a mask."
1,37,Is there a group of people who don't want to be involved in this ordeal?
12,37,> Are you still interested in what the government did to stop a child from having the virus?
20,37,Wearing a mask while working out is shady and funny. What if people want to go to the doctor? Aren't they given a right to wear a mask because they are sick? I don't know but i'm an immigrant.
28,37,>How many people wear masks? How many people do you believe need to wear one?
29,37,I’m against the new mask and the way they are going.
31,37,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
36,37,What is the significance of having a face mask? Is it for the public benefit? Is it to the public interest? Or maybe even to the government to have it on you?

41,37,He should be able to explain how he is concerned about the effects of the pandemic before he becomes a terrorist.

28,37,It's really a stupid law that the government should not be involved in this ordeal. You do nt have to take your mask off until after the vote if you want to see the effects on children.
