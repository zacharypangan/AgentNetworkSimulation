48,39,I like your first sentence. I'm not going to argue that it's a good idea to not wear a mask. I want to do more research on this than I can do on the topic of vaccinations. I think that is not what he was suggesting at the time.
50,39,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
12,39,CANNOTANSWER is referring to a new law that makes a mask mandatory to the government.
15,39,"I don't want to be involved with the president. It's a good point. The government is taking a very cautious approach. It's not the ""right"" to go out there and use a mask, and it's the right to not go."

19,39,Who says that the government has the power to prevent pandemics?
21,39,I don't understand that CANNOTANSWER's point.
26,39,In this case I was going to ask if that was a common misconception among the general population.
28,39,"The issue was that [her father's face mask, which was given out as a service, was made mandatory in his state when the bill passed. Unless he has any proof that this actually caused the disease, then he was doing a great job."
34,39,"The reason for having a face mask is because it's not appropriate for a kid. The problem that is being vaccinated is the same. It's a pain in the ass, but it doesn't prevent the infection of people, and it's a problem that isn't that good for you."
39,11,"I'm a guy in my 20's, who wears a face mask all the time and I hate getting infected with virus. So I'm kind of concerned about this."
