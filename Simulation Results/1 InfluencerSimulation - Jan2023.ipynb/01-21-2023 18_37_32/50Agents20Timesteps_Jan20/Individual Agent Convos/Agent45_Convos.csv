49,45,masks are nothing but a placebo unless you have a surgical grade mask there really is no point even the sainted dr faucci admitted it at the beginning of all this i am pro vaccine my family are all cleared but the new idea that all the children need to be shot now is idiocy
1,45,I just drew a picture of myself reeking a huge awe of a mask on coaching baseball practice today. Especially when you remember how it was a beautiful day.
3,45,"It should be a choice, and people have the right to wear them."
5,45,"What did you wear? Like a mask over your nose? I mean, it really sucks a mask does it, you don't really know it if you go there and just think about it unless you're at work or just in a hot room where people are hysterical or it's just you."
15,45,Isn't the trump on it?

23,45,"You're right about the mask being headline news, but that's not what it sounds like:"
35,45,'i think it was cool to see you wearing a mask and fucking yourself a little.'
39,45,It was awesome. I wear a mask while a team is getting vaccines for a virus and when the virus spreads it's pretty cool to see.
40,45,"i agree with you that the government should not be involved in this ordeal, but you do nt have to take your mask off until after the vote if you want to see the effects on children."

15,45,"Well, I would like to say that the best thing you can do to prevent a pandemic is to help people who haven't been vaccinated."
17,45,"Yes, it is. But you do have to take your mask off until after the vote if you want to see the effects on children."
18,45,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
20,45,"Oh, I'm not even a voter, but my friend who's a Democrat, wears a mask for his political campaigns. That's all there is to it."
23,45,"Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
35,45,"No one was wearing masks while working out at the gym today. They were tamed to remove them. I don't think they're really a privilege, but they were a privilege. They were a privilege to be given a mask on practice."
39,45,I've been a baseball coach at a local university. I'm sure you're a fan of my thigh mask fetish.
40,45,"[Billy White](https://www.nih.gov/news/events/events/events/events/events) is pretty shady and funny. I like to believe that when I think about a teen that might be wearing a mask to show off the fucking virus to young adults, it can make me feel terrible about myself.

15,45,What do you think the viral infection is? Does it spread to people?
17,45,"I am not a politician, but I do get a feeling that I'm being a bitch and that the masks aren't helping my family or the government. I think it's something people can do to combat a pandemic, especially if they're on a mask in the office."
18,45,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
20,45,Wearing a mask while working out is shady and funny. What if people want to go to the doctor? Aren't they given a right to wear a mask because they are sick? I don't know but i'm an immigrant.
23,45,"I think this post is really misleading. It just echoes the shady and funny part. I think a person can be infidel by thinking that they should be allowed to wear a mask, but that's a really important part."
35,45,"I don't really have much of a problem with this, though. This is like saying that a lot of the government can do shady stuff, but at the same time it's just not the best way."
39,45,"Have you tried lowering your mask to cough? 'i think it was cool to see you wearing a mask and fucking yourself a little.' i agree with you that the government should not be involved in this ordeal, but you do nt have to take your mask off until after the vote if you want to see the effects on children."
40,45,I think they should start a campaign about it. Why are they not trying to convince a voter to get a piece of legislation to prevent this kind of thing?
45,3,People wearing masks that's not enough to stop a pandemic from spreading is going to cause a famine. The point of a pandemic is to prevent the spread. It's the reason why people have a life. It is a sign of social ineptitude.

3,45,I don't really think that there is a group of people who don't want to be involved in this ordeal. I would just ignore it and go home and look for another post for you to post in the next few days.

35,45,"As someone who's been in the military, I'd say they are a lot more responsible and responsible in their policy decisions than many people are willing to do.
