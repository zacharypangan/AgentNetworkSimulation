34,21,My brother wears a face mask at his hockey practice every day. It's so annoying and disrespectful and insecure.
48,21,IANAL but I would ask if anyone I see who doesn't wear a mask is wearing a mask for a flight on the job.
50,21,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."

17,21,"I am not a politician, but I do get a feeling that I'm being a bitch and that the masks aren't helping my family or the government. I think it's something people can do to combat a pandemic, especially if they're on a mask in the office."

16,21,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
17,21,CANNOTANSWER and his family wore masks all the time and it was uncomfortable for them.

32,21,How can someone make a teen feel horrible about having to wear a mask when they are already being vaccinated? What is the difference between having a mask and a face mask?
34,21,"Why don't you just wear a mask outside while vaccinated to prevent it? No one was wearing masks while working out at the gym today. They were tamed to remove them. I don't think they're really a privilege, but they were a privilege. They were a privilege to be given a mask on practice."
48,21,This is the sort of thing where there are a lot of ramblings about how people wear their masks to combat the pandemic and are asked to vote for changes.
