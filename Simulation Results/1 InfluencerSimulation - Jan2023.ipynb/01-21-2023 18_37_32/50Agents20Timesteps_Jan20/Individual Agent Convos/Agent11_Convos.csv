14,11,get the body i want or break out on my face from having to wear a mask at the gym
15,11,continuing to mask up amp distance reduces the transmission of the virus amp if you do get it the virus won t leave you your immune system will handle it vaccines also reduce pressure on overwhelmed healthcare systems vaccines mean more milder cases if the vaxxed do get it

42,11,i m wearing a mask outside while vaccinated because people like you are in my face why does it bother you to the point that you are asking random people why they are doing something that makes them feel safe

31,11,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
35,11,'i think it was cool to see you wearing a mask and fucking yourself a little.'
39,11,It was awesome. I wear a mask while a team is getting vaccines for a virus and when the virus spreads it's pretty cool to see.
42,11,I think I will be the first one to say this

39,11,I've been a baseball coach at a local university. I'm sure you're a fan of my thigh mask fetish.
42,11,It's really a stupid law that the government should not be involved in this ordeal. You do nt have to take your mask off until after the vote if you want to see the effects on children. I'm going to go buy you a gun. i think i'm a bit weird for having a face mask on.
43,11,"The people who think of that aren't a threat to the public are probably a danger to the public. But that doesn't mean that the government should not be involved in this ordeal, but that if a group of people isn't involved in this ordeal they should be concerned about their safety, and not just to the public.''"
8,11,It seems like Trump has a mask in his wallet that has a huge awe of it on coaching baseball practice today. Especially when you remember how it was a beautiful day. I'm gonna get on that side.

8,11,"The government shouldn't do anything about the issue if the problem is actually a societal issue that isn't addressed by the people they represent. The problem is not the mask, but the lack thereof. The problem is that the public and the federal government are trying to control them. It's not about preventing the problem.

11,30,"This is really a stupid idea, and what's more idiomatic is that when a teen is wearing a mask to show off the virus to young adults, the risk is very low, so if he isn't wearing a mask, he's not going to be very concerned about himself or the other person.

43,11,It's a joke and it's not a joke. The point is that he's a politician. What he has said is a lie.
8,11,"CANNOTANSWER is a very good politician. What he said was a lie. I guess you're right it's a big red flag."""
11,30,"I feel that, and I have heard it said, many times."
13,11,"[Im a lawyer. Iâ€™m a lawyer, not a politician.](http://www.rnr.com/rnr/wizard-definition/) that is an AMA."

31,11,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
35,11,"â€œThe people who wrote the cig donâ€™t make a good statement about that. Itâ€™s not the ""right"" to go out there and use a mask, and itâ€™s the right to not go."
39,11,"CANNOTANSWER'S characterization of this was a bit off and it wasn't his opinion, he's a defender of ""shady and funny,"" and he's a pretty cynical one."
42,11,It's a joke. What he's saying is a joke. And it sounds like it isn't a joke. And he's not a politician. He is just a clown and you should listen to him.
43,11,The person in question is in the military and I don't know what that means. It is a lie and a joke. It's a good thing that you don't like people like this. Is there something that you don't like about the guy?

15,11,"""... if you did not and acted improperly or wrongly, youâ€™ll be out of a problem. Youâ€™re not a doctor."""
16,11,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
18,11,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
19,11,I'm confused because I am a lawyer. I'm confused because I am a lawyer. I am a lawyer. I am confused because I am a lawyer.
31,11,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
35,11,[...Is it really a joke that someone isn't on the same page?

43,11,"CANNOTANSWER is a member of the American Legion of Foreign Wars, and we have to deal with this. Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
8,11,"So, I think you are implying that a mask is not a dick and it's not a dick at all? Because, yes, the president is the president."
11,30,This explains a lot about the people in charge of the military and the president.

18,11,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."

43,11,">I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. Iâ€™m a lawyer, not a politician."
8,11,The president is an idiot. We don't talk about the threat of pandemic. It's a joke.
11,30,"How many of these comments are ""the people who don't want to be involved in this ordeal?"""
13,11,"I think you have a great response. It's worth mentioning that """

31,11,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
35,11,"What are you saying about the government, a lawyer?"
39,11,That's a very difficult subject. Probably not very interesting.
42,11,"""I don't want to be involved."""

13,11,"CANNOTANSWER said that ""You're right about the mask being headline news, but that's not what it sounds like"""
14,11,What is the joke in the AMA?
15,11,"the obama administration has been a bit over-sensitive with this. His comments on vaccines are just a little gross, and he's trying to get us to see the ""Meat on the Moon"" kind of stuff, and it's a real issue here."

35,11,"I am not sure if I can be the only one who can tell you what I believe about your character. But if the remark he said was a lie, I'm afraid the rest of you aren't. It's a good start."
39,11,What are you saying about the government?
42,11,"Are you trying to say he's a politician, a doctor or something else?"
43,11,"Is the president concerned that his wife will get infected? If yes, you can be there."
8,11,Its a big red flag.
11,30,CANNOTANSWER says the president is a bad politician.
13,11,"CANNOTANSWER was referring to a new law that makes a mask mandatory to the government. You're a dick, but you are a joke. I think he's a dick."

31,11,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
35,11,A doctor isn't a lawyer. But I do believe that the government is a great politician. I think that the government should be aware of the dangers and be able to protect people and make them aware of what's happening.'
39,11,>what he said was a lie.
42,11,"The post's title has a link to a great article that mentions the current presidential situation and this comment has been upvoted down to zero because the post's title doesn't seem to suggest that the president would be able to get rid of this guy. It might not be clear to everyone else, but the main issue here is whether the president has the resources to keep his mind on the current issue and the situation. It's also a nice little joke."
43,11,He's a doctor. It's his job as a lawyer to make the right choices for the kids.
