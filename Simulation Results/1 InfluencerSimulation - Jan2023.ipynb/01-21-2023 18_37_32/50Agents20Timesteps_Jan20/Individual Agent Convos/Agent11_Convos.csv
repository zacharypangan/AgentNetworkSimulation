14,11,get the body i want or break out on my face from having to wear a mask at the gym
15,11,continuing to mask up amp distance reduces the transmission of the virus amp if you do get it the virus won t leave you your immune system will handle it vaccines also reduce pressure on overwhelmed healthcare systems vaccines mean more milder cases if the vaxxed do get it

42,11,i m wearing a mask outside while vaccinated because people like you are in my face why does it bother you to the point that you are asking random people why they are doing something that makes them feel safe

31,11,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
35,11,'i think it was cool to see you wearing a mask and fucking yourself a little.'
39,11,It was awesome. I wear a mask while a team is getting vaccines for a virus and when the virus spreads it's pretty cool to see.
42,11,I think I will be the first one to say this
43,11,I’m going to go buy you a gun.

39,11,I've been a baseball coach at a local university. I'm sure you're a fan of my thigh mask fetish.
42,11,It's really a stupid law that the government should not be involved in this ordeal. You do nt have to take your mask off until after the vote if you want to see the effects on children. I'm going to go buy you a gun. i think i'm a bit weird for having a face mask on.
43,11,"The people who think of that aren't a threat to the public are probably a danger to the public. But that doesn't mean that the government should not be involved in this ordeal, but that if a group of people isn't involved in this ordeal they should be concerned about their safety, and not just to the public.''"
8,11,It seems like Trump has a mask in his wallet that has a huge awe of it on coaching baseball practice today. Especially when you remember how it was a beautiful day. I'm gonna get on that side.

14,11,"I'd like to make a point here: The fact that the government's doing that is something they should be concerned about is not the same thing as saying, ""You're not a pandemic. You're a pandemic. Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it.

They can't just ignore the fact that you don't care about the outcome of their conversation. They can't even really stop thinking about the issue, either."
8,11,"The government shouldn't do anything about the issue if the problem is actually a societal issue that isn't addressed by the people they represent. The problem is not the mask, but the lack thereof. The problem is that the public and the federal government are trying to control them. It's not about preventing the problem. It's about preventing the problems from being discussed. If you can't control them in a respectful manner you don't have a problem with them."

39,11,There are some really great reasons to leave. It's kind of like the government wanting you to put it on their face and reclaim it as a privilege instead of an inconvenience.

11,30,"This is really a stupid idea, and what's more idiomatic is that when a teen is wearing a mask to show off the virus to young adults, the risk is very low, so if he isn't wearing a mask, he's not going to be very concerned about himself or the other person. The problem with this situation is that they are too busy being a dick to be aware of the dangers."
