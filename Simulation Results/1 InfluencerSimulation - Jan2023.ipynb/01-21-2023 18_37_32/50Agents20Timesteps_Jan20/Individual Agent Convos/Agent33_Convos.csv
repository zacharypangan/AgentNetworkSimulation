37,33,"You're the one who says that? I gotta ask the question because it's very, very difficult to say if you think I'm referring to the word pandemic. You say your business is a pandemic. But this is so ridiculous."
46,33,IANAL - but i read that and i think it was the person who was hysterical with it?
47,33,i think i'm a bit weird for having a face mask on.
48,33,IANAL but I would ask if anyone I see who doesn't wear a mask is wearing a mask for a flight on the job.
50,33,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."

37,33,So I just thought it was a good idea to wear a mask while working out at the gym. Why is that not so important? It's the only way for it to work and there's no other way to make a difference when people are talking to people.
46,33,"I think it's an important point that everyone should have a right to wear a mask, but if everyone wanted to, there are very very many other issues that can be overcome by wearing a mask."

34,33,"I don't know about you, but I've written this one before."
36,33,What is the significance of having a face mask? Is it for the public benefit? Is it to the public interest? Or maybe even to the government to have it on you?
37,33,Honestly I've never heard anyone in a way that I would be the first one to do this.
