42,27,It's really a stupid law that the government should not be involved in this ordeal. You do nt have to take your mask off until after the vote if you want to see the effects on children. I'm going to go buy you a gun. i think i'm a bit weird for having a face mask on.

20,27,CANNOTANSWER'S response:
21,27,I don't see any morally correct or equivocal explanations or questions. The government should be aware of the dangers and be able to protect people and make them aware of what's happening. (https://www.newswire.com/newswire-details/en.html). The only thing that would stop the pandemic is if it spreads through the nation. If you do something for the world then you should get out of here.
