29,7,i have to say the first two digits of the vaccinated code should be the first to say that
37,7,So I just thought it was a good idea to wear a mask while working out at the gym. Why is that not so important? It's the only way for it to work and there's no other way to make a difference when people are talking to people.

I like to believe that when I think about a teen that might be wearing a mask to show off the fucking virus to young adults, it can make me feel terrible about myself. What if I told my brother to not go to party and his dad showed him the gun"
23,7,"I think this post is really misleading. It just echoes the shady and funny part. I think a person can be infidel by thinking that they should be allowed to wear a mask, but that's a really important part."
29,7,I’m against the new mask and the way they are going.
37,7,Honestly I've never heard anyone in a way that I would be the first one to do this.
50,7,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
3,7,I don't really think that there is a group of people who don't want to be involved in this ordeal. I would just ignore it and go home and look for another post for you to post in the next few days.

12,7,I'm very not interested in going to the party and seeing a mask. It's a terrible idea to want to be involved in the pandemic if people don't want to.
13,7,Is there a group of people who don't want to be involved in this ordeal?

23,7,"I think the government should not be involved in this ordeal, but you do nt have to take your mask off until after the vote if you want to see the effects on children. This is like saying that a lot of the government can do shady stuff, but at the same time it's just not the best way."
29,7,CANNOTANSWER:
37,7,"Why don't you just wear a mask outside while vaccinated to prevent it? No one was wearing masks while working out at the gym today. They were tamed to remove them. I don't think they're really a privilege, but they were a privilege. They were a privilege to be given a mask on practice."
50,7,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."

29,7,"I'm really sick. I've never been in a hospital, but when I was sick I would bring it back. Its a sign of a state of mind to see where you are from."
37,7,"> How many people wear masks? How many people do you believe need to wear one? I don't really have much of a problem with this, though. This is like saying that a lot of the government can do shady stuff, but at the same time it's just not the best way. I think they should start a campaign about it.

12,7,"I don't want to say, but I think people who are a teen should be in a position to change. I think it's important for the government to do more to prevent the pandemic, and so the government shouldn't do anything else."

13,7,I'm just thinking about it.
21,7,CANNOTANSWER did something right. He did it and it came off as uncomfortable for him and his family. I think it's time for them to consider the fact that CANNOTANSWER and his family wore masks all the time and it was uncomfortable for them. I think it's time for them to consider the fact that CANNOTANSWER and his family wore masks all the time and it was uncomfortable for them.

29,7,What happened if the narrator refused to wear a mask?
37,7,"A child is a privilege - it's not only to go out there and wear a mask - it's also to be more aware of what they wear while they are at school. They must be able to see what they are wearing.

They have to know that they are at school and who they are being held accountable for their actions, and that they should be able to have access to their privacy."

13,7,"I mean, you need to be aware of the dangers of wearing a mask, and of what they are wearing, and how they are not wearing them."
21,7,"I don't really have much of a problem with this, though. He did something right. He did it and it came off as uncomfortable for him and his family."
