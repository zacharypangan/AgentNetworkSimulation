14,10,"I’m a big fan of the old 'I don’t want to be involved. I don’t want to be involved. But I’m very comfortable with having a face mask. But a normal face mask can never stop the virus, and that’s exactly why it can’t stop people from a pandemic. What about the guy who has been a teen who wears a mask all the time and is afraid of getting infected? What if they went in a crowded place, asked if anyone would wear a face mask?"
18,10,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
21,10,"""Then you need to explain that it's not ""the best thing to do for your health, so you can protect yourself."""

18,10,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
21,10,I don't see any morally correct or equivocal explanations or questions. The government should be aware of the dangers and be able to protect people and make them aware of what's happening. (https://www.newswire.com/newswire-details/en.html). The only thing that would stop the pandemic is if it spreads through the nation. If you do something for the world then you should get out of here.
23,10,The question is - do you have any moral issues?
27,10,"That's a pretty good question, but a little cynical at the same time. It's hard to say when you have a point here, but to me it sounds like the general stance is that people are a little bit'snobby' for having a mask, even if they aren't quite the same, if they can't really make a point in any way. It's hard to say, as a general rule, that you're a really good idea to have a mask"
