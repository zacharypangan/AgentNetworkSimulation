4,18,why in the world do you come into my business and immediately remove pull down your face mask why we are still in the middle of a pandemic
6,18,before i got covid i always wore my mask would have it on in the house and car by accident bc i would forget about it after getting sick tho it s been harder to breathe with it on and my face just gets so hot and uncomfortable
10,18,my favorite thing to do when i see people not wearing a mask is cough as hard as i can right in front of them because the fear in their eyes is always so rewarding

28,18,wait a damn min we gotta wear mask while working out at the gym
37,18,the fact that wearing a mask is headline news vs just an assumption is a sad reality imagine seriously think about how you would react to reading the following in january of gov andrew cuomo wears pants as he arrives at the white house
38,18,how i feel after taking off my n mask after every hour shift
47,18,please leep your mask on i don t want you to be taken out by a virus that is not gone
49,18,masks are nothing but a placebo unless you have a surgical grade mask there really is no point even the sainted dr faucci admitted it at the beginning of all this i am pro vaccine my family are all cleared but the new idea that all the children need to be shot now is idiocy
4,18,A little girl who is now a coach at the local university has been given a mask on her first day to the practice. It's quite a privilege to be a coach.
6,18,I'm against the new mask and the way they are going.

38,18,i do... i don't really care what you say
47,18,i think i'm a bit weird for having a face mask on.
49,18,Well the masks don't stop it.
4,18,I just drew a picture of myself reeking a huge awe of a mask on coaching baseball practice today.
6,18,Why don't you come in my business and immediately remove pull down your face mask why we are still in the middle of a pandemic why in the world do you come in my business and immediately remove pull down your face mask why we are still in the middle of a pandemic why in the world do you come into my business and immediately remove pull down your face mask why we are still in the middle of a pandemic why in the world do you come into my business and immediately remove pull down your face mask why we are still in the middle of a pandemic

28,18,Why don't you just wear a mask outside while vaccinated to prevent it?
37,18,So I just thought it was a good idea to wear a mask while working out at the gym. Why is that not so important? It's the only way for it to work and there's no other way to make a difference when people are talking to people.
38,18,"There's a guy in the uk who's been with us for four years with a face mask, who thinks he has a chance of stopping it. He's got a mask in the back."
47,18,Is there a good reason to wear a mask to prevent it from happening?

28,18,>How many people wear masks? How many people do you believe need to wear one?
37,18,Honestly I've never heard anyone in a way that I would be the first one to do this.
38,18,"It is ridiculous. When I see an older person wearing a mask I fuck up and think they're cool and cool and like how they are, it annoys me. I'm always afraid it's the most dangerous thing to be wearing. I don't see why the government can't be involved in it if there is no way to prevent the effects."
47,18,a lot of people get this. They are cynical and I don't see how they can even be the ones doing what they are done for the same purpose.
49,18,A man who has been in this pandemic and a man who is still alive and has not been in the middle of it is in the middle. He has not even been in the middle.
4,18,"The govt is taking a very cautious approach. It's not the ""right"" to go out there and use a mask, and it's the right to not go. It's the best choice."

I'm going to go buy you a gun. I'm against the new mask and the way they are going. I'm against the new mask and the way they are going. I'm against the new mask and the way they are going.
37,18,"Why don't you just wear a mask outside while vaccinated to prevent it? No one was wearing masks while working out at the gym today. They were tamed to remove them. I don't think they're really a privilege, but they were a privilege. They were a privilege to be given a mask on practice."
38,18,The government is trying to prevent this stuff for good reasons. They need to get a bill passed before it starts.
47,18,What would be the first and foremost important to you?
49,18,This is pretty shady and funny. Wearing a mask while working out is shady and funny.

37,18,"A child is a privilege - it's not only to go out there and wear a mask - it's also to be more aware of what they wear while they are at school. They must be able to see what they are wearing. Unless they are wearing a mask, they cannot be confident enough to do so. They have to know that they are at school and who they are being held accountable for their actions, and that they should be able to have access to their privacy."
38,18,"Is a mask a problem or a privilege? I am not sure, but a mask is just another person."

I'm not a big fan of all of these people saying that they are not a doctor, but I am saying that if you aren't a doctor, the government should look after you. The way this explains things is that people will be upset about it and they will complain about it. But they will also be upset if you get into the mindset that if you are a conservative and a bigot, you can just continue to make sense of the problem, that"
4,18,I am a little concerned because of my age.
6,18,"Are you sure you were talking about a really great politician who doesn't have a mask? Because the question is that, if he wants to stay in the military, he has to be a flier on the news, a doctor and a politician."
