I just don't want to go with anyone else because I feel like that's a blatant misrepresentation of his health. But I guess it's a privilege to have to wear a mask "
43,40,I don't think it's a bad idea to wear a mask in public.
50,40,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
10,40,I don't want to do any harm because I'm not a citizen
23,40,"He also says he is a doctor 'cause he is a dick' and the obama administration has been a bit over-sensitive with this, and that he feels uncomfortable talking about vaccines."
27,40,"""Why does being a teen like this cause the rash of pandemics?"""
28,40,"This is the correct response. We are not talking about the 'if you flagrantly disregard public health guidance and refuse to wear a mask you shouldn't be allowed treatment at all let alone top tier treatment the rest of america can't access', 'i don't think i ll catch the cough i already had it i m against them cuz they ruin the economy get people fired and people should be able to choose to wear a mask if they want not by force', '' people should be able to stop the pandemic."
29,40,I'm not sure what you mean. I mean I don't really care about being sick.
32,40,"â€œThis is just a big red flag. What does a mask and a mask have to do with a person who is a teen? Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, itâ€™s useless and I hate it."

10,40,"He's a doctor he's been a doctor since he was 5 years old, and the US has a history of causing pandemics."
23,40,"CANNOTANSWER was referring to a new law that makes a mask mandatory to the government. This isn't the same thing as saying that a lot of the government can do shady stuff, but at the same time it's just not the best way."
27,40,"CANNOTANSWER is a very intelligent, and responsible, man who has made a career in healthcare and has been making a career out of it and is still working."
28,40,"[NAME] was going to tell his brother to take his mask off when the first big viral pandemic happened, and then he said, ""Hey, it's really dangerous that people get sick."""
29,40,"CANNOTANSWER has a very intelligent, and responsible, man who has made a career in healthcare and has been making a career out of it and is still working."
32,40,I don't think the government should be aware of what the pandemic is about. This is the correct response.

50,40,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
10,40,That's how the government is trying to be the best.
23,40,"I have a feeling he was expressing this in an attempt to make himself look more like someone that might be looking like someone who was looking at a picture of himself and thinking, ""It's not the best thing to do for your health, so you can protect yourself."""
27,40,"I think a lot of the government's role is to protect against the spread of a pandemic, but it does not go far enough to prevent another one."
28,40,"The issue was that [her father's face mask, which was given out as a service, was made mandatory in his state when the bill passed. Unless he has any proof that this actually caused the disease, then he was doing a great job."
29,40,if you do anything for the world then you should get out of here.
32,40,"There's a lot of good advice here - I would go to a medical center to find a new face mask and get vaccinated but because I'm a teen and I want my own, I'm afraid, as a human being, to go see a doctor who specializes in this subject - and I will go see a doctor who specializes in this subject.

27,40,CANNOTANSWER is a good politician. What he said was a lie.
