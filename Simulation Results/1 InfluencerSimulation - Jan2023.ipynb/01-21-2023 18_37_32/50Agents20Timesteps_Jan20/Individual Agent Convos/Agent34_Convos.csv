42,34,It's really a stupid law that the government should not be involved in this ordeal. You do nt have to take your mask off until after the vote if you want to see the effects on children. I'm going to go buy you a gun. i think i'm a bit weird for having a face mask on.
43,34,"The people who think of that aren't a threat to the public are probably a danger to the public. But that doesn't mean that the government should not be involved in this ordeal, but that if a group of people isn't involved in this ordeal they should be concerned about their safety, and not just to the public.''"
47,34,Is there a good reason to wear a mask to prevent it from happening?
2,34,CANNOTANSWER:
5,34,"If you are serious about anything, read the headline :"

15,34,What do you think the viral infection is? Does it spread to people?

I'm always afraid it's the most dangerous thing to be wearing. I don't see why the government can't be involved in it if there is no way to prevent the effects."

47,34,a lot of people get this. They are cynical and I don't see how they can even be the ones doing what they are done for the same purpose.

43,34,"Honestly, when I hear a shitstorm over a gun, if it's not actually necessary to stop a pandemic, it's a pretty big red flag. It's really just a big red flag, and it sucks to hear it when it's actually necessary for an outbreak."
47,34,What would be the first and foremost important to you?
2,34,"It's like saying that a lot of the government can do shady stuff, but at the same time it's just not the best way."

I'm not joking, but I'm in a lot of ways not a very nice person and I want to see how he's doing in the coming weeks. I just don't want to go with anyone else because I feel like that's a blatant misrepresentation of his health. But I guess it's a privilege to have to wear a mask "
43,34,I don't think it's a bad idea to wear a mask in public.

2,34,Are there any issues with wearing a face mask?

43,34,My favorite quote from this episode:
47,34,"I'm a very conservative, I think. I'm also a very conservative, I think. I don't think people can stand the fact that the government is trying to evade the risk of pandemics."
2,34,"When the news is out, and he is on TV, how about a tv show?"

15,34,"He said they are uncomfortable, but not about it."
20,34,CANNOTANSWER and his family wore masks all the time and it was uncomfortable for them. I think it's time for you to consider the fact that CANNOTANSWER and his family wore masks all the time and it was uncomfortable for them.

43,34,That's not a joke. It's a joke.
47,34,"If they can't see people from a mask, they need to make sure that there are vaccines in place. If you don't see a person from a mask, you can't tell anyone from a face mask because that's what they think they can see."
2,34,"If it would be the proper answer, I would tell the reporter."
5,34,CANNOTANSWER is a good politician. What he said was a lie.
12,34,CANNOTANSWER is referring to a new law that makes a mask mandatory to the government.
15,34,"I don't want to be involved with the president. It's a good point. The government is taking a very cautious approach. It's not the ""right"" to go out there and use a mask, and it's the right to not go."
20,34,"[Brown, she wore a mask because she was not a doctor and was not a doctor]. It is not a'shady stuff' that she can do to fight the pandemic and a 'right' to be concerned about."
34,5,"The reason for having a face mask is because it's not appropriate for a kid. The problem that is being vaccinated is the same. It's a pain in the ass, but it doesn't prevent the infection of people, and it's a problem that isn't that good for you."

42,34,"That's a pretty good question, but a little cynical at the same time.

5,34,I don't like these quotes. I'm interested in the conversation.
12,34,Can you imagine a movie where I don't know how to explain 'Cannotanker'?
15,34,CANNOTANSWER's comment was in reference to a person on a tv show he's on for the majority of his life.
