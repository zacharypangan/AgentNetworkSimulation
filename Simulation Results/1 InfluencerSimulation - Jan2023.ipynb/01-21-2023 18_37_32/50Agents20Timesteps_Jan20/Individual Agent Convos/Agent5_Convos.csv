40,5,"[Billy White](https://www.nih.gov/news/events/events/events/events/events) is pretty shady and funny. I like to believe that when I think about a teen that might be wearing a mask to show off the fucking virus to young adults, it can make me feel terrible about myself.

43,5,"The people who think of that aren't a threat to the public are probably a danger to the public.

40,5,"I'm not sure what this is about, but this is not a thing we can be doing."
43,5,"Honestly, when I hear a shitstorm over a gun, if it's not actually necessary to stop a pandemic, it's a pretty big red flag. It's really just a big red flag, and it sucks to hear it when it's actually necessary for an outbreak."

43,5,"That's so blatantly misleading. This is a fact, in my opinion, that people need to stop making any comments about a person who is doing it. They can't just ignore the fact that you don't care about the outcome of their conversation. They can't even really stop thinking about the issue, either."
47,5,"This is so crazy, if it's a good thing to wear a mask you'll never hear from your mom again."

47,5,"I don't see the danger in having to wear a mask, it is because it will make your health worse. There is a difference between being a teen and being vaccinated."
1,5,I just think the government should be aware of the dangers and be able to protect people and make them aware of what's happening.
