1,22,even with a mask on coaching baseball practice this morning on a beautiful almost fall day was incredibly refreshing
2,22,if you vote biden you will be singing with a mask on because he will make masks mandatory for life a muffled sebastian bach i wouldn t pay to see you now and certainly not pay to see you with a mask on trump
6,22,before i got covid i always wore my mask would have it on in the house and car by accident bc i would forget about it after getting sick tho it s been harder to breathe with it on and my face just gets so hot and uncomfortable
10,22,my favorite thing to do when i see people not wearing a mask is cough as hard as i can right in front of them because the fear in their eyes is always so rewarding
22,17,some of these people s face masks be looking like they stink so bad using the same mask for the past days
22,30,some of these people s face masks be looking like they stink so bad using the same mask for the past days
22,31,some of these people s face masks be looking like they stink so bad using the same mask for the past days
22,32,some of these people s face masks be looking like they stink so bad using the same mask for the past days
22,33,some of these people s face masks be looking like they stink so bad using the same mask for the past days
23,22,i m not against vacks mandates cuz i don t think i ll catch the cough i already had it i m against them cuz they ruin the economy get people fired and people should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force
39,22,a special shout out goes to mr londono amp ms latorre we loved the teachable moment of mask wearing and addressing covid questions also a very happy birthday to our vebbulldog jamya
43,22,your mask go over your nose
47,22,please leep your mask on i don t want you to be taken out by a virus that is not gone
48,22,thank you for requiring mask wearing in the house hall it is unfortunate a selfish delusional minority of house members must be forced to consider the welfare of others
1,22,I just drew a picture of myself reeking a huge awe of a mask on coaching baseball practice today. Especially when you remember how it was a beautiful day.
2,22,It's a pretty good thing that people get sick.
6,22,I'm against the new mask and the way they are going.
10,22,"I think it's an important point that everyone should have a right to wear a mask, but if everyone wanted to, there are very very many other issues that can be overcome by wearing a mask."
22,17,I think the only person in your world who doesn't want a mask is a politician with a mask on.

23,22,"You're right about the mask being headline news, but that's not what it sounds like:"
39,22,It was awesome. I wear a mask while a team is getting vaccines for a virus and when the virus spreads it's pretty cool to see.
43,22,I’m going to go buy you a gun.
47,22,i think i'm a bit weird for having a face mask on.
48,22,IANAL but I would ask if anyone I see who doesn't wear a mask is wearing a mask for a flight on the job.
1,22,I'm gonna get on that side. I just drew a picture of myself reeking a huge awe of a mask on coaching baseball practice today. Especially when you remember how it was a beautiful day.
2,22,"I have to go, and think about this."
6,22,Why don't you come in my business and immediately remove pull down your face mask why we are still in the middle of a pandemic why in the world do you come in my business and immediately remove pull down your face mask why we are still in the middle of a pandemic why in the world do you come into my business and immediately remove pull down your face mask why we are still in the middle of a pandemic why in the world do you come into my business and immediately remove pull down your face mask why we are still in the middle of a pandemic
10,22,So what did this guy just say?... if he could if he'd only given his signature in a letter...

23,22,"Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
39,22,I've been a baseball coach at a local university. I'm sure you're a fan of my thigh mask fetish.
43,22,"The people who think of that aren't a threat to the public are probably a danger to the public. But that doesn't mean that the government should not be involved in this ordeal, but that if a group of people isn't involved in this ordeal they should be concerned about their safety, and not just to the public.''"
47,22,Is there a good reason to wear a mask to prevent it from happening?
48,22,"I think it's an important point that everyone should have a right to wear a mask, but if everyone wanted to, there are very very many other issues that can be overcome by wearing a mask."

23,22,"I think this post is really misleading. It just echoes the shady and funny part. I think a person can be infidel by thinking that they should be allowed to wear a mask, but that's a really important part."
39,22,"Have you tried lowering your mask to cough? 'i think it was cool to see you wearing a mask and fucking yourself a little.' i agree with you that the government should not be involved in this ordeal, but you do nt have to take your mask off until after the vote if you want to see the effects on children."
43,22,"A new, unproven, shady law is like the [Lenny White](https://www.nih.gov/news/events/events/events/events/events/events) is pretty shady and funny. I like to believe that when I think about a teen that might be wearing a mask to show off the fucking virus to young adults, it can make me feel terrible about myself. What if I told my brother to not go to party and his dad showed"
47,22,a lot of people get this. They are cynical and I don't see how they can even be the ones doing what they are done for the same purpose.
48,22,Why is your face covered with a mask?
1,22,>Is there a group of people who don't want to be involved in this ordeal?
2,22,"The fact that the government's doing that is something they should be concerned about is not the same thing as saying, ""You're not a pandemic. You're a pandemic.

10,22,"That's a good question, but that's not the question I'm putting up here. "
22,17,"CANNOTANSWER is the first one to describe how she feels about 'it's a pretty good thing that people get sick'. She's referring to wearing a mask, 'wearing it is pretty good', but I don't really think anyone has to say that."

39,22,Unless you're a hugely anti-vaccine person. This is not an anti-vaccination thing.
43,22,"Honestly, when I hear a shitstorm over a gun, if it's not actually necessary to stop a pandemic, it's a pretty big red flag. It's really just a big red flag, and it sucks to hear it when it's actually necessary for an outbreak."
47,22,What would be the first and foremost important to you?
48,22,This is the sort of thing where there are a lot of ramblings about how people wear their masks to combat the pandemic and are asked to vote for changes.
1,22,"There's a real problem with being a face mask, that is why you're wearing it, in the first place. It's the best thing you can do."
2,22,"It's like saying that a lot of the government can do shady stuff, but at the same time it's just not the best way."
6,22,This is why the government doesn't care about children.

23,22,"In my opinion, he should have told me that the government should do more to stop the pandemic than to stop the people from getting sick and getting vaccinated."
39,22,>How many people wear masks? How many people do you believe need to wear one?
43,22,"That's so blatantly misleading. This is a fact, in my opinion, that people need to stop making any comments about a person who is doing it. They can't just ignore the fact that you don't care about the outcome of their conversation. They can't even really stop thinking about the issue, either."
47,22,"This is so crazy, if it's a good thing to wear a mask you'll never hear from your mom again."
48,22,"I have no idea what that means, but I've heard it on a number of occasions. It's just that I never liked wearing my mask."
1,22,I am a little concerned because of my age.
2,22,I think it's time for you to consider the fact that CANNOTANSWER and his family wore masks all the time and it was uncomfortable for them.
6,22,"""Which are the issues that bother me about wearing a face mask, so I can't give you an excuse?"""
10,22,"That's how the government treats kids, that's why CANNOTANSWER's dad was in a public school."

23,22,"Are you saying that the government is trying to evade the risk of pandemics? If so, then you might think they are trying to convince a voter to get a piece of legislation to prevent it."
39,22,There are some really great reasons to leave. It's kind of like the government wanting you to put it on their face and reclaim it as a privilege instead of an inconvenience.
43,22,"I'm a huge fan of the ""I don't want to be involved. I don't want to be involved. I don't want to be involved. Is there a group of people who don't want to be involved in this ordeal?

No one was wearing masks while working out at the gym today."
47,22,"I don't see the danger in having to wear a mask, it is because it will make your health worse. There is a difference between being a teen and being vaccinated."
48,22,"""Why don't you just wear a mask outside while vaccinated? They were tamed to remove them."
1,22,I just think the government should be aware of the dangers and be able to protect people and make them aware of what's happening.
2,22,"The obama administration has been a bit over-sensitive with this. His comments on vaccines are just a little gross, and he's trying to get us to see the ""Meat on the Moon"" kind of stuff, and it's a real issue here."

10,22,I don't think people can stand the fact that the government is trying to evade the risk of pandemics. I think the fact that the government is trying to evade the risk of pandemics is something they should be concerned about.

1,22,CANNOTANSWER is a very good politician and one of the people he flies in as a flier on the news should be in the midst of the pandemic.
2,22,"""But if you did not and acted improperly or wrongly, you'll be out of a problem. You're not a doctor. That's why you're wearing a mask. If you're a doctor, you should not be wearing a mask at all. Why are you being a dick?"
6,22,The idea that it's really bad to not wear a mask is fucking silly.
10,22,"They could be afraid of the pandemic. CANNOTANSWER isn't a doctor, he's a human, not a doctor. If they knew that they could not see anyone from a mask, and therefore he is infected, they'd have a pretty good reason to wear a face mask."

Because you can be a vaccinated teenager in a private school, but we are also extremely important that you don't"
43,22,I don't think it's a bad idea to wear a mask in public.
47,22,"I have no idea why this is so critical, but it is absolutely true."
48,22,"It isn't like a lot of people are talking about a pandemic, it's a large epidemic."
1,22,How much are he paid?
2,22,Are there any issues with wearing a face mask?
6,22,I don't think he's a good politician and it is a bad idea. I think the CANNOTANSWER party is trying to evade pandemics by trying to convince a voter to get a piece of legislation to prevent them.

43,22,That's not a joke. It's a joke.
47,22,"If they can't see people from a mask, they need to make sure that there are vaccines in place. If you don't see a person from a mask, you can't tell anyone from a face mask because that's what they think they can see."
48,22,I like your first sentence. I'm not going to argue that it's a good idea to not wear a mask. I want to do more research on this than I can do on the topic of vaccinations. I think that is not what he was suggesting at the time.
1,22,It's the government's responsibility to tell people the dangers of the pandemic.

6,22,"It sounds like I just learned that CANNOTANSWER is a member of the American Legion of Foreign Wars, and we have to deal with this."
10,22,It seems that the first time people have heard that quote is the first time you've heard this. Cannotanywer is a good politician. What he said was a lie.
22,17,The problem with wearing a mask is that you get sick and people can’t care about it.

23,22,"> ""It's a pretty good thing that people get sick."","
39,22,What is the problem with your job?
43,22,It's a joke and it's not a joke. The point is that he's a politician. What he has said is a lie.
47,22,"You said something that I don't think the government is doing, which I was not, which I feel is a bad idea."
48,22,"""We have our reasons."" Which is not a good quote."
1,22,"In a way, I'm not sure what you are thinking, but I'm gonna say: ""Sure, this is a dick, but this is a dick, you're a dick."""
2,22,I'm confused because I am a lawyer. I am a lawyer.
6,22,"CANNOTANSWER, a doctor, is a politician, not a lawyer."
10,22,"'Cannotanywer is a very good politician. What he said was a lie. I guess you're right it's a big red flag."""
22,17,I can't be that person but I will never wear a mask unless I think that putting on a mask would make me sick or sicker.
22,30,I can't be that person but I will never wear a mask unless I think that putting on a mask would make me sick or sicker.

22,33,I can't be that person but I will never wear a mask unless I think that putting on a mask would make me sick or sicker.
23,22,"What's the problem with saying that, after all?"
39,22,"CANNOTANSWER'S characterization of this was a bit off and it wasn't his opinion, he's a defender of ""shady and funny,"" and he's a pretty cynical one."
43,22,The person in question is in the military and I don't know what that means. It is a lie and a joke. It's a good thing that you don't like people like this. Is there something that you don't like about the guy?
47,22,"The problem isn't the cigarette, but the pandemic itself."
48,22,CANNOTANSWER is a pretty good politician.
1,22,"CANNOTANSWER explains that the president doesn't like the mask, he dislikes the fact that it's being used to shield him from the pandemic."
2,22,A guy who sunk a little more in the military is still a dick if they get in trouble with a government. I can't help but wonder what kind of guy is lying about it?
6,22,the mask is not a dick. you're a dick.
10,22,""" CANNOTANSWER, I am a doctor, is a politician, not a lawyer. I'm a lawyer, not a politician. I'm a lawyer, and we have this conversation about the government and what you need to understand about the problem and how to deal with it."

39,22,...Is it really a joke that someone isn't on the same page?
43,22,"CANNOTANSWER is a member of the American Legion of Foreign Wars, and we have to deal with this. Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
47,22,CANNOTANSWER is a very good politician. What he's saying is a joke. What he's saying is a joke. And it sounds like it's not a joke. And he's not a politician.
48,22,"I can't imagine having to go to school to be a doctor, to be in the military."
1,22,“I think the president is an idiot. It's not a joke. We do not talk about the threat of pandemic. It’s a joke.”
2,22,[Women have masks]. :(
6,22,CANNOTANSWER and CANNOTANSWER are one of the few Americans who is a member of the American Legion of Foreign Wars and they seem to have the same issues as you.
10,22,"And if he's a member of the American Legion of Foreign Wars, it's useless and I hate it."
22,17,CANNOTANSWER is a doctor and a lawyer. He quoted the guy saying 'why the government doesn't care about children'

23,22,Why did the Obama Administration choose to make them mandatory?
39,22,"This is why we should not allow doctors to speak to the public, and that we need to protect our children from it."
43,22,">I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I’m a lawyer, not a politician."
47,22,CANNOTANSWER and his family wore masks all the time and it was uncomfortable for them.
48,22,"[NAME]... is a doctor and not a lawyer and the only thing he is talking about is the fact that the government is doing that is something they should be concerned about is not the same thing as saying, ""You're right about the mask being headline news, but that's not what it sounds like""', ""I guess you're right it's a big red flag."""
1,22,So a lot of people are taking what they say very seriously.
2,22,What is the joke in the AMA?
6,22,"CANNOTANSWER said that ""You're right about the mask being headline news, but that's not what it sounds like"""
10,22,"CANNOTANSWER explains that the president doesn't like the mask, he dislikes the fact that it's being used to shield him from the pandemic."

23,22,"CANNOTANSWER is a lawyer, not a lawyer, who speaks about the government and what it does."
39,22,That's a very difficult subject. Probably not very interesting.
43,22,CANNOTANSWER is a lawyer in the US and he's at the helm of the AFL-CIO. This isn't the best guy to be in an AMA.
47,22,">Which are the issues that bother me about wearing a mask, so I can't give you an excuse?"", ""I'm also a very conservative, I think."", """
48,22,"I am a doctor, a lawyer, and I don't think it's a joke that he is trying to evade pandemics. I've heard some pretty crazy things about that guy."
1,22,It's a big red flag.
2,22,"CANNOTANSWER and others are taking their side on a shitstorm, right?..."
6,22,CANNOTANSWER was referring to a new law that makes a mask mandatory to the government.
10,22,"I see it now. I can't see what a joke would mean, but I understand it was not intended."
