There's a lot of good advice here - I would go to a medical center to find a new face mask and get vaccinated but because I'm afraid, as CANNOTANSWER andPeter"
49,31,I think you have a good point. Is the fact that the government is trying to evade pandemics because it's hard to talk about and it's a joke to just say that's a joke?
17,31,"CANNOTANSWER is a member of the American Legion of Foreign Wars, and we have to deal with this."
22,31,The only thing that would stop the pandemic is if it spreads through the nation. If you do something for the world then you should get out of here.

49,31,I am pretty sure this is the first time this has been asked:
17,31,“You’re a pandemic. We can’t stop the virus if the people in our country don’t wear them.”
22,31,The problem with wearing a mask is that you get sick and people can’t care about it.

49,31,Why do you think that's a joke?
17,31,CANNOTANSWER and his family wore masks all the time and it was uncomfortable for them.
22,31,CANNOTANSWER:
30,31,CANNOTANSWER is a doctor and a lawyer. CANNOTANSWER quoted the guy saying 'why the government doesn't care about children'

45,31,CANNOTANSWER is a cynical politician.
49,31,"Cannotanywer is the head of the national anti-vaccine group. It's more of a political comment about the US and the military, while they can't take their own advice."
17,31,It is also common for people who say that wearing a mask in public is a bad idea because the 'Meat on the Moon' kind of stuff can be uncomfortable and you have to be careful with the timing.
22,31,CANNOTANSWER is a doctor and a lawyer. He quoted the guy saying 'why the government doesn't care about children'
30,31,"Yes, I am a lawyer. I was merely responding to one of the comments: ""Cannotanywer has a lot of facts to share with us that he might have a serious misunderstanding of this quote."
