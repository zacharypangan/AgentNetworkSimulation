99,92,huge covid fail to have santa not wearing a mask in thanksgivingdayparade would have been so powerful and such an endorsement of healthcareheroes wearamask
92,6,oh no! this is a good story

92,23,Is that the first time I've seen a python on the radio? I don't like this stuff.
92,33,i love how you have snooping and you have my hands off to keep me clean.
92,38,"i don't even like this subreddit, but i really like how it isn't as good as you've been posting, i wonder what the topic is"

93,92,> Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus
99,92,Having a mask in the snow in the snow at this time of year would have been much more powerful.
92,6,"It's a great post, I hope you enjoy it."
92,15,"You're absolutely right. There is no reason to fear a virus spreading to anyone without the health care, and it has been proven in the US to be much more effective than any other vaccine."
92,23,I have been here before but you are just saying that you think there is nothing in the newer movies that explains why you don't like these types of movies.
92,33,"In the case of an old person, I can confirm that Mark and Mark both have snooped on the same person."
92,38,"I'm sorry Mark, but this is a good story."
92,39,Having a mask in the snow in the snow at this time of year would have been much more powerful.
92,70,"I don't believe Mark is referring to that vaccine as the same vaccine as the one he had, not the one he used."
93,92,"he said ""[i like] wearing a mask on a run I like to wear a mask when I run, and I don't think it would help if I did it on Thanksgiving or Christmas Day."""
99,92,"If you don't like santa, I recommend going to Santa Claus. If you really want to see that. You don't have to wear a mask every day, because that's just another thing that's supposed to be done."
92,6,I am so sorry Mark but I don't trust this vaccine i understand your concern for the residents of erie county i obey the mask mandate wash and sterilize my hands when returning home from work and elsewhere i'm so sorry Mark but I don't trust this vaccine i understand your concern for the residents of erie county i obey the mask mandate wash
92,15,The Vaccine that helps people to live a virulent life is a good one. The reason you're so sorry for this vaccine is because of the stigma surrounding it.
92,23,"I'm also a fucking python. The problem is that a man with a mask in his mouth might go on a run, because of a virus, and he does not seem to have that confidence in him, so he wouldn't have to go out for a run unless he wanted to wear it every day."

92,38,I am assuming a number of people in this sub aren't saying the same things.
92,39,"It sounds like you're probably missing the point of this post, which I don't really understand, but that's part of a larger thread about it."
92,70,"The film does not include a warning on the public safety camera, and is written with a specific reference to the disease. The vaccine may contain the virus, but it is not the same as the one used."
93,92,"I was just reading the article and the implication is that a bit of it could be related to something else in the story, like what happens when someone screams at you, and then comes up with the excuse to tell the whole story again, but that is kind of what you're looking at here."
99,92,I really like the movie. It's very well written. But I still like it.
92,6,I'm not sure what you mean by 'not trusting the vaccine '. It's one of the parts of the vaccine that is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
92,15,"I hate to sound a little sarcastic. I don't like to snoop on the guy I actually snooped on a few times. I'm pretty sure that a lot of the facts in this article are true, so I'm going to give you a good one, though."
92,23,Having a mask in the snow at this time of year would have been much more powerful.
92,33,"What the fuck did he say to people? It's like ""Oh no, don't do it. But don't do it!"""
92,38,"You're also a python. The problem is that a man with a mask in his mouth might go on a run, because of a virus, and he does not seem to have that confidence in him, so he wouldn't have to go out for a run unless he wanted to wear it every day."
92,39,"I know a lot of people in the U.S., and there are definitely a lot of people who believe that the only way to get to a sick person is through a ""muscle mask"" and using it for a cold or an flu. I grew up watching tv and movies and it was a lot easier and quicker than the internet. And it made me really sad. I didn't want to go out to see the movie if they didn't have the same sort of mental illness as I do. I don't know what they want to do with"
92,70,There's a reason people hate this vaccine...
93,92,Exactly! The government should have a place to do whatever it is they can to protect themselves.
99,92,Wearing a mask in the holiday season makes you a less attractive human being.
92,6,Getting a mask makes you a fucking python.
92,15,"I'm not even sure what you mean. Honestly, that's not what a python can do. I can't see anything wrong with that."
92,23,"I was snooping at a party the other day. And I was like, ""Hey, have you seen this?"" It made me feel a little bit sad..."
92,33,"I'm really sorry, and I'm sorry I can't even comprehend that I have an answer to that question. This is a part of my life. I have an amazing body and the best health possible. I will do it. I will live it."
92,38,"I was going to make a quick post about why people hate the virus... but instead of going to see it, they want the public to know about it. I guess I am gonna take a long, hard hard look at it because it is actually pretty great, but the point being is that it makes the vaccine seem less harmful, and I was really wishing it would have helped me so much."
92,39,"I'm not sure about this, but I think you should read the whole thing, it's so incredibly easy to fall asleep and not believe it's a vaccine that is actually a way to prevent infection, and that you can't believe that the government uses it for that purpose."
92,70,So you're assuming that a number of people in this sub aren't saying the same things.
93,92,I didn't want to be dramatic but I'm trying to point out how a lot of people are being manipulated. There are a lot of people in the internet who don't understand why people wear masks in video game communities. It makes the joke and the joke really hard.
99,92,"...I wore a mask, and it is my favorite holiday movie, and I was able to enjoy it, and still enjoy it."
92,6,"I'd like to go a little deeper on why we need to keep our mouths clean while doing all the chores and cleaning of the houses, but not for all the reasons the doctors and docs have described."
92,15,">I was just reading the article and the implication is that a bit of it could be related to something else in the story, like what happens when someone screams at you, and then comes up with the excuse to tell the whole story again, but that is kind of what you're looking at here."
92,23,"I'm sorry. I can't understand why you're being dramatic. I'm really sorry, and I'm sorry I can't even comprehend that I have an answer to that question."
92,33,I like this video so I will start by saying what I am doing in the tv interview
92,38,"It's a terrible disease, and I can't believe it's being spread by other diseases."
92,39,"I'm sure that there's a lot of people who believe that the only way to get to a sick person is through a ""muscle mask"" and using it for a cold or an flu."
92,70,"I have a phobia about the word ""snoop"" as it relates to a lot of things. I'm pretty sure I don't really like a lot of people on the internet who like to snoop and the guy I actually snooped on has mental health issues. Apparently the vaccine is a vaccine which isn't much better. The underlying issue is that a person is being manipulated and if they don't believe it then they will continue using it."
93,92,"OP, here's the thing that I can't stand — this whole thing makes me nervous, because I'm wearing a mask, and I get the feeling that my skin is not going to be able to breathe properly. It's not a joke because you're being silly. It's an unfortunate mistake, and it's a joke."
99,92,"> I'm just glad to see that I’m wearing a mask in the holiday season and that it’s only really the same as the masks, just not the same."
92,6,"""We're gonna take a long, hard, hard look at it because it is actually pretty great, but the point being is that it makes the vaccine seem less harmful, and I was really wishing it would have helped me so much. I was gonna make a quick post about why people hate the virus... but instead of going to see it, they want the public to know about it. I guess I am gonna take a long, hard hard look at it because it is actually pretty great, but the point being is that it's a, and an, inhuman,"
92,15,"Despite the fact that that is not an opinion, there's no real reason to worry about it. A lot of people on the internet don't think that this vaccine is a viable solution and it's a way to protect people, and it's more about the government than the person's health, not whether or not it's effective."
92,23,The underlying issue is that a person is being manipulated and if they don't believe it then they will continue using it.
92,33,Why are you taking this comment as a joke?
92,38,"It's not a joke. It's a sham. I'm sorry for trolls, but they're so stupid. It's not a joke. They're not going to tell you, it's a joke. It's not the same as a joke."
92,39,"> I'm just glad to see that I'm wearing a mask in the holiday season and that it’s only really the same as the masks, just not the same."

93,92,It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
99,92,"In the beginning of the article I read an interview where people were telling people if their'santa' was wearing a mask, he was saying that his 'hat' was his way of ""preventing the spread of the virus""."
92,6,"Considering the article, I can't remember if you read the actual article, but as I recall, a lot of people in that sub are probably saying that the implication was that people don't understand the vaccine and instead of going to see it, they want the public to know about it."
92,15,What's a python? What are the implications for a human being putting in a mask? I'm sure there's a lot of the problems around a person who can't just see what they're doing in their head. What do you think?
92,23,"OP, here's the thing that I can't stand — this whole thing makes me nervous, because I'm wearing a mask, and I get the feeling that my skin is not going to be able to breathe properly."
92,33,"''I don't trust this vaccine i understand your concern for the residents of erie county i obey the mask mandate wash and sterilize my hands when returning home from work and elsewhere'', 'In the case of an old person, I can confirm that Mark and Mark both have snooped on the same person.''"
92,38,OP is right he is a python.
92,39,"I don't have a diagnosis, but I do have a vaccination. It helps the TB and my asthma symptoms. I've had multiple people sick in this world for 4 years and if it works for anyone I don't know it's not possible."
92,70,"It's also not a joke. It's a joke. I hate to say this, but it's not a joke."
93,92,ad. It doesn't make sense.
99,92,"It's a good way of making your friends feel good, but a bad way to bring up your own issues, and make friends that will be as happy as they can be."
92,6,"OP and his ""comments"" made me sad because I realized how little I respect my health. He said something like ""What's a python? What are the implications for a human being putting in a mask?"" The ""comments"" were purely a rebuke to me. It's not a joke. It's a joke. It's not a joke. Despite the fact that that is not an opinion, there's no real reason to worry about it."
92,15,"If I remember correctly, I had a mask on for my birthday. I also had a vaccine for me, but I had been having an allergic reaction to it for a year. My friend had this nastier virus. I had this nastier virus and the vaccine was causing more infections. He could not even catch a tick and I got it every week. The doctor never told me to get it."
92,23,"I think the word ""hiiiiiiiiiiit"" is the correct one. It's a joke."
92,33,"He is probably a hypocrite, but as a person with a high tolerance for the flu (the first few years of his life), it doesn't really make sense to have the snooping ad 'to the doctors' in the beginning."
92,38,[I am assuming a number of people in this sub aren't saying the same things.
92,39,The joke is a joke. It's not a joke.
92,70,"""I'm so sorry Mark but i don't trust this vaccine,"""
93,92,"I have seen this, and even though OP has made a few similar comments, I agree with the author."
99,92,I hate wearing a mask. It is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
92,6,"It's just a joke. Getting a vaccine and knowing it doesn't mean wasting your time on a python. That is not a joke, and I think you deserve to have a positive outlook on this subject."
92,15,"So, the vaccine doesn't help, doesn't it? I've got a couple years of experience as a python tampering with me, and the only thing I've ever known that irritates me is my wife's snooping mania."
92,23,"I don't know why you're being dramatic. I'm really sorry, and I'm sorry I can't even comprehend that I have an answer to that question. It's a joke."
92,33,"""That's a joke, Mark! That's a joke!"" ""That's a joke, Mark! That's a joke, Mark!"""
92,38,"No I do not care what people say or say. I do know the implication of this. If someone told me to wear the vaccine, they'd be so angry about it that I might take a long, hard look at the implication of it."
92,39,"That is a serious question. I think you should consider asking yourself ""Why the heck do you think it's possible to put a python in a mask?"". ""But I don't believe it can prevent the spread of a virus."
92,70,People make jokes about snooping. I have to agree with others who would be uncomfortable doing that. The question isn't why it's so common.
93,92,I think this could be a good idea but in my opinion the CDC is just trying to make a joke that would be easy to understand.
99,92,">I'm just glad to see that I’m wearing a mask in the holiday season and that it’s only really the same as the masks, just not the same."""
