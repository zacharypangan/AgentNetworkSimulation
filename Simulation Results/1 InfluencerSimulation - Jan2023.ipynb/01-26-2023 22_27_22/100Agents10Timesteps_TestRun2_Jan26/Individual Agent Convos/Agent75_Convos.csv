76,75,continuing to mask up and distance reduces the transmission of the virus and if you do get it the virus won t leave you your immune system will handle it vaccines also reduce pressure on overwhelmed healthcare systems vaccines mean more milder cases if the vaxxed do get it
87,75,i m wearing a mask outside while vaccinated because people like you are in my face why does it bother you to the point that you are asking random people why they are doing something that makes them feel safe
90,75,hey i just saw you are running miles across florida right now curious if you would share what is the route im in orlando and would love to come run with you even if just for a mile i d wear a mask and keep distance
100,75,really interesting in light of people s resistance to wear a mask both the mask and the shopping cart are measurements of empathy
75,1,We can't afford that. It seems like it has to be the most efficient way to get away from the fear of the pandemic.
75,2,"Wearing a mask helps prevent the spread of the virus, but at the same time, it will reduce your vulnerability to the virus if it lingers. I know a couple years ago that the government was concerned for those who did not want to run."
75,3,This seems like a joke.
75,12,"When I was in Orlando and got sick I would go to a party with a house full of people who weren't in my face. I would ask where I had the last mask I could find to get rid of them and get the rest of the people they would probably get sick at. Then again I can't seem to come back after my first bite of the papilloma, and I would wear a mask when they get sick."
75,19,Wearing a mask during a pandemic is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
75,20,"People like me don t even want to run in a pandemic. Sadly, there are other places I can t see that have a pandemic."
75,21,"A neo nazism will not be as successful in stopping a pandemic, they just want to make sure their bodies stay strong enough to survive. And to the point where they aren’t able to control their immune system in the face of the virus or other viruses."
75,23,People can be a little bit too afk and they are so afraid that they could face a full pandemic when they are not allowed to. People can be very nice and friendly and a person can help with anything else if they want.
75,26,The reason for this is the pandemic
75,34,"They aren t necessarily the problem, but they also aren t the culprit. There is always a chance there will be a pandemic or something."
75,38,"They don't have any protections from the pandemic, they just have to tell the government about the pandemic so they can spread the virus. Apparently there s an outbreak and the government is doing what they need to keep it from spreading."
75,45,"oh yea there are lots of times where people in a house full of ppl not wasting mask during a pandemic, but this isn't as effective as the people who are numb to the pandemic."
75,48,i'm going to be going to a party with a house full of ppl not wasting mask during a pandemic
75,49,Why do you think the gov't can keep the mask away?
75,55,I wouldn’t go to a party with a house full of ppl not wasting mask during a pandemic.
75,59,Go to a party with a house full of ppl not wasting mask during a pandemic don t go to a party with a house full of ppl not wasting mask during a pandemic
75,65,"If I was going to go to a party with a house full of ppl not wasting mask during a pandemic, I'd say I'd say that's the best way to go to prevent people from getting virus from your home."
75,71,he is not wrong at all and is not in the same room. do you like your way of thinking?
76,75,I know people in my local church say it is the most helpful thing ever for us to do and we all know what is wrong. Vaccination is about prevention. We need to be more proactive about preventative health.
87,75,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.i wear a mask outside while vaccinated because people like you are in my face why does it bother you to the point that you are asking random people why they are doing something that makes them feel safe i m wearing a mask outside while vaccinated because people like you are in my face why does it bother you to the point that you are asking random people why they are doing something that makes them feel safe i m wearing a mask outside while vaccina

75,1,"I think that's just the way it works, as people who have a phobia of going to a party a lot of the time, and some of them seem to be on a low note for how they would handle going to the party. You can't afford that. They just don't do it because they can't afford the time, or because they can't afford it, and their minds get blown out. But you can still go for a nice run at parties and people will run the jokes in your mouth. You're being a dissenting"
75,2,Vaccination is about prevention. We need to be more proactive about preventative health.
75,3,"I am not a doctor or doctor, but I would like to be able to show my friend what you mean. You are completely right to keep my body safe if you come down to the pandemic, and it is good to keep your friends safe. I also recommend getting a new mask that you can take off."
75,12,It is a symptom of a bad immune system because of the pandemic.
75,19,"People are sick. A pandemic is a problem. If you can't stop it by spreading the virus, you need a new one."
75,20,"In the U.S., it's mandatory to get a mask to prevent pandemics. I don't think it's a joke. I do think a mask does have a role in stopping the spread of a virus."
75,21,"I went to the party with a mask containing the people who wouldn't wear them. They didn't care what was going on. They knew that what was going to happen would happen if they didn't get their bodies to a certain level. They also said that they'd do everything possible to prevent a pandemic. In my experience a mask, and a mask, is one thing."
75,23,"You're actually getting a chuckle out of this, especially since it doesn't even include the word ""Material."""
75,26,"I can't get myself to wear a mask. So I just can't. It's kind of annoying, and I'm going to end up getting a cold and that makes me sick."
75,34,I am going to run in a pandemic. There are times when people like you are going out of their way to run a party.
75,38,"I'm not a papilloma guy, I am a papilloma person, so I'm really not sure what the difference is. Vaccination is an issue that I'm interested in but I'm not sure it's any less important than if I had the option to stay away from pandemics or if I was a huge papilloma fanatic. I also want to emphasize that people who aren't in my face are not necessarily the culprit. This is a huge problem and the biggest problem is that"
75,45,Wearing a mask while vaccinated can be a good thing.
75,48,"It's called ""Panthering at the Party"" in English, and it's called the ""Panthering at the Party"" in German. The term is intended to imply that the person that is ""snapping"" on is a part of the virus's genetic makeup."
75,49,It is the best thing ever for us to do. We need to be more proactive about preventative health. I would love to come out with my husband and have an interesting conversation about it.
75,55,I don't really like my gov't being the one putting out a pandemic and I would be going to a party with a house full of people who weren't in my face.
75,59,> Are you still wearing a mask?
75,65,"It seems like this is about being a part of the government. It's not about a pandemic, it's about being a part of the cause. It's not about stopping the spread of the virus. I'm not saying it's bad, it's the problem."
75,71,"Vaccination is a very useful, non-religious thing for children and young people. I believe it's not always enough to stop people from getting sick and dying. That's why it's the best way to protect a child from developing a child."
76,75,I love the vwiy. It's just a really good idea.
87,75,"I want to be vaccinated as well. However, I feel bad about this because I'm a doctor."
90,75,"hey i d say this if you had a mask, that would make me so sad"
100,75,The idea that the mask is required to do the entire day of the week is a problem with the way people wear their masks - a mask for example - is not as effective as a mask for the day of a major change in the environment - people actually wear masks.
75,1,"If the person you see wasn't in your face, they wouldn't be able to see you."
75,2,The definition of a 'pants at the party' is the same as 'preventative health'. That's not an option.
75,3,"[In my experience, a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I am not a doctor or doctor, but I would like to be able to show my friend what you mean."
75,12,"I like to think of the term as ""I'm not a doctor, but I would like to be able to show my friend what you mean."""
75,19,"[NAME]: ""Wearing a mask during a pandemic is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
75,20,"It's a problem. If I had to change the mask, I would wear it at all times. I don't think that's a joke. I'm just letting people know my jokes and it really makes me feel like a failure."
75,21,I think the first thing we want to do is be more proactive about the anti-vaccination movement.
75,23,"RIP ""Girlfriend"""
75,26,"The issue is that in Germany, there's a mask to prevent the spread of a viral infection."
75,34,"""I can't wear a mask"" is a word used in many different contexts. This is a fucking joke - and they should be ashamed of it. Vaccination is a very good thing, but it should be a very small part of protecting the population."
75,38,"I'm sure that's why people want to get their face checked on and to see their own bodies. There's no 'no' in there, not enough room for me to be in the party"
75,45,"It is a huge problem, and not a joke."
75,48,"Aside from the obvious implication of ""being a part of the cause"" it's also a problem with the way people wear their masks. I don't think it's bad or in any way wrong but there is a difference between a mask and a mask."
75,49,>I would love to come out with my husband and have an interesting conversation about it.
75,55,"I'm a doctor so I would be ok with this. I am getting a lot of comments on this topic from people in different walks of life, but this post seems to have a lot to do with the fact that you are trying to come up with a way to prevent a pandemic because you want to be a part of the government, not the other way around."
75,59,"The fact that they said ""the only way you'd be able to stop the spread of the virus is to get the new mask off,"" does not seem to be a joke. I would say it's more about making sure you're not wasting masks."
75,65,"My husband has a papilloma, and when I go to his party he wears a mask and is going to be going outside in a mask and drinking a glass of water to prevent someone from getting sick. This is pretty common practice."
75,71,"I want to add to this that I have a big issue with the government putting out pandemics and what's more, it's not mandatory to get a mask for everyone."
76,75,The article states that the CDC does not have a policy against people not being vaccinated.
87,75,>I'm wearing a mask outside while vaccinated... but the states still do not allow that.
90,75,">[The first paragraph was part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. I'm from Oregon. I have been there a few times. I have worn the mask several times over the years. It's a really good excuse to do the dirty work. It's exactly what a slapstick mask is supposed to do: It's an excuse to take it with you, but that's just it. That's why I wear it."
100,75,The biggest problem is not that the idea that the mask is required to do the entire day of the week is not as effective as a mask for the day of a major change in the environment - people actually wear masks.
75,1,I see a big difference in people's resentment for having to go to their party to go to a pandemic.
75,2,"If the government wants to stop the spread of a virus, it needs to have a policy on how to protect the population."
75,3,It's the only way to prevent pandemics:
75,12,"In order to save the environment, people must wear masks. They are not a substitute for the health care or a treatment for the illness. They don't require that people wear them unless they are a threat to the public. I mean, it's not as simple as this."
75,19,"It's also the joke. I like to think of the term as ""I'm not a doctor, but I would like to be able to show my friend what you mean."""
75,20,"I'm actually gonna leave my papilloma and go to a party, I am going to be the one to come in."
75,21,They say it's not a joke. You are just a stupid kid and don't know what you are talking about.
75,23,"I'm also a doctor. I've never had a papilloma, but a mask to prevent the spread of the virus has been in use for hundreds of thousands of years."
75,26,"I have a friend who has a case of pandemic virus, and he wears a mask for the day. he wants to wear it in case he needs to come out and have an interesting conversation about it. I'm a doctor so I'm ok with this."
75,34,"It's a huge problem. I'm sure that's why people want to get their face checked on and to see their own bodies. There's no 'no' in there, not enough room for me to be in the party. It is a huge problem, and not a joke."

75,55,"The first paragraph is a joke - I think the first thing we want to do is be more proactive about the anti-vaccination movement. RIP ""Girlfriend"""
75,59,What's this? I'm going to be lying to myself about the CDC and saying they need to get some health care done for the people in charge of protecting us from the papilloma.
75,65,I think the best way to prevent people from getting virus from your home is to wear a mask at all times.
75,71,"I want to add to this that I have a big issue with the government putting out pandemics and what's more, it's not mandatory to get a mask for everyone. The article states that the CDC does not have a policy against people not being vaccinated."
76,75,I like the word vwiy. It's just a really good idea. I like to wear a mask and bend over so I don't wear a mask. Wearing a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend
87,75,"I don't believe that the government is incompatible with something. They are talking about a virus, not a doctor."
90,75,I don't think they understand how to tell you. Is it a prank that you are referring to? What kind of prank is it? Is there any way to tell you anything and to make it work for you? Or is it something to tell someone else?
100,75,I don't know a lot about these things.
75,1,">They say it's not a joke. You are just a stupid kid and don't know what you are talking about. I'm also a doctor. I've never had a papilloma, but a mask to prevent the spread of the virus has been in use for hundreds of thousands of years."

75,21,I'm a doctor and wear a mask. I am a doctor.
75,23,RIP a papilloma guy. What's this?
75,26,"Apparently the government isn't incompatible with what they say, a prank. The government is trying to control that and so it's not the best course of action in the whole thing."
75,34,CANNOTANSWER: Is it a prank - what kind of prank is it? Is it a prank that you are referring to?
75,38,There are a lot of jokes about the government wanting to prevent a pandemic.
75,45,I am not a doctor and I don't want to be a papilloma guy. I just want to be a doctor.
75,48,I’m not sure what you mean by ‘no mask at all’. But it does seem like a simple word.
75,49,The CDC needs to stop putting out pandemics to stop the spread of a disease - they are not forcing people to wear a mask because they are not required to. They are doing this so they don't get caught in the act.
75,55,"RIP ""Girlfriend"" What's this? I'm going to be lying to myself about the CDC and saying they need to get some health care done for the people in charge of protecting us from the papilloma."

75,71,A papilloma is a papilloma that can be spread via direct contact with the lungs through oral contraception and /or oral injections. It's still a disease. It's just not there yet. It's a pretty common papilloma.
76,75,"I don't think it was actually a problem. I said it in an interview to the CNS: ""I'm not a troll. I'm a troll. I'm not a troll."""
87,75,"I'm trying to guess, he's going to get pissed at a certain guy for putting on a mask and not a guy for wearing it. And then someone else says, ""Have you ever tried going outside to get vaccinated?"""

It was actually used to describe a pandemic, which is a condition of the immune system that may have been linked with the pandemic. The CDC has a a program to help protect the population from pandemics because there is a lot of people can't prevent it,"
75,19,I'm gonna try to figure out what my husband has done.
75,20,I'm an AIDS patient. I have my own Papilloma and I have an annual exam to find out if a friend has it. I think you are right that it is very common to have a papilloma.
75,21,"Those are good terms to use here, but you can't be sure. They're not a joke."
75,23,Wearing a mask to prevent a pandemic is very important to prevent it.
75,26,">I don't think there is a big problem with wearing a mask, or not knowing what a papilloma virus and vaccine is not a prank."
75,34,What if you're not going to a party with a house full of pythons? Are they not having a pandemic?
75,38,There's a lot of pranks and jokes about the government wanting to prevent a pandemic.
75,45,"I would like to think of the term as ""I'm not a doctor, but I would like to be able to show my friend what you mean."""
75,48,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. You are not offended by the idea of wearing a mask, but it is the only way to prevent pandemics. You are not offended by the idea of wearing a mask, but it is the only way to prevent pandemics. You are not offended by the idea of wearing a mask, but it is the only way to prevent pandemics."
75,49,"Despite this information, I would be hesitant to answer the questions you've got. This is a lot of information to answer."
75,55,"I have a little problem with PPLS, I wear a mask in a lot of parties."
75,59,So I'm not a doctor and my family is a doctor. But I've been vaccinated and got a lot of help for this. I feel sick every time and I'd rather be vaccinated for the flu.
75,65,"I'm not really sure, in the USA, you can get a lot of the vaccinations with a mask in a day. But in general it's better than a mask in the face of something nasty."
75,71,"I'm a doctor. I'm a doctor. I know what a prank is, but I don't know what a prank is."
76,75,So why do you wear a mask?
87,75,">The CDC is going to do more than just stop the spread of the virus, they're not going to do anything about it."
90,75,You slap a face book on a prank you are not going to like and then you do it for fun.
100,75,I'd like to add a bit:
75,1,"""If the person you see wasn't in your face, they wouldn't be able to see you."""
75,2,"I just think that when you consider your remark about a ""prank"" you utterly ignore the point of your remark. And you recite the whole fucking article because you didn't give me any answer."
75,3,"The term ""Past a Mask"" was used to describe a pandemic. CDC had a program to help prevent pandemics because there is a lot of people can't prevent it, I'm gonna try to figure out what my husband has done. I'm an AIDS patient. I have my own Papilloma and I have an annual exam to find out if a friend has it."
75,12,"There is a lot of pranks. I guess your response is a little different from my previous comment. I don't think I have ever dated a CDC agent who didn't seem to know how to properly protect the public from pandemics. I think you should also mention that the CDC's program is intended to stop pandemics, and it's supposed to prevent pandemics, so you might see it as an extension of a prank, but also a prank and say what you have, I've been told before"
75,19,">People are sick. A pandemic is a problem. If you can't stop it by spreading the virus, you need a new one.',"
75,20,"""If I had to change the mask, I would wear it at all times. I don't think that's a joke."""
75,21,I think you're overly critical of CDC.
75,23,i'm so scared of being in a pandemic and not wearing a mask
75,26,"I've been told by some people that wearing a mask isn't a prank and that a lot of things aren't a prank. In my experience, a mask isn't exactly a prank if it's too loud or too loud. I can't think of any good things you could do if you were going to do it for fun."
75,34,So is this a prank? Because it's a prank. It's the government's way of ensuring the spread of a virus and whatnot.
75,38,"Virus and vaccines, including papilloma, is not a prank, it is an anti-vaccine campaign, and the CDC has a program to help prevent the spread of a pandemic."
75,45,That's what a joke is.
75,48,I think you're just being a little naive. It's not that the idea of wearing a mask isn't an ailment.
75,49,Unless you have a papilloma.
75,55,It's all a prank.
75,59,"""Don't go to a party with a house full of ppl not wasting mask during a pandemic"""
75,65,"'Can't be a doctor, but I would like to be able to show my friend what you mean'."
75,71,"You may be an idiot, but you're an idiot. The only thing I would have to worry about is whether or not you want to go to a party where people aren't vaccinated. I don't think you deserve it."
76,75,"I've been in a situation where I've been vaccinated, I've been on a daily basis and I've noticed a huge difference. I'm sure the CDC has some problems, but we can make some progress."
87,75,"It's a joke. People are wearing masks because it prevents them from being vaccinated. I don't care if the CDC does anything about that, as long as they're not doing anything 'good' to people."
90,75,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. I like a prank that's about me running a marathon, but my friends have been to Orlando and to come home to the house in the same time they run with me."""
100,75,">People who don't know what a python is. I think that ""If you get sick, you will be infected."" I think that ""[I'm not really a huge fan of that kind of thing, but what I'm interested in about this is the question of whether you should wear a mask to protect yourself?"","
75,1,"I've been told by some people that wearing a mask isn't a prank and that a lot of things aren't a prank. """
75,2,"I'm sorry, but I can't agree with you more than that, because the government isn't incompatible with something."
75,3,"I've been to a CDC conference and a guy told me that wearing a mask helps with preventing the spread of a virus, so when I was born and the flu shot I was pretty young. I had a family member who took him in when I was in his late 20s and is now a CDC employee. We had a family member who didn't have a papilloma but was very smart enough to be able to tell if he was infected. I got to a lot of things to do and I don't"
75,12,"I think it's just a joke, a bit of a prank."
75,19,"I can understand that a prank isn't a prank. And you're not the only one who wants to be offended by a prank, it's just that you want to be offended by an idea, and not be offended by a joke. That's how it should be framed."
75,20,I can tell you a lot about the papilloma joke.
75,21,">Can't be a doctor, but I would like to be able to show my friend what you mean'."
75,23,"I'm a doctor, and I've had to wear my mask all day for an extra night. I'm not sure why I would do that but I'm sure they wouldn't have any issues with a mask. If it doesn't work, I will wear my mask all day. I just won't go for it. Unless I have a papilloma, I don't know if it's a prank, because my husband has an AIDS infection, but I would like to be able to help him."
75,26,The only thing I'm interested in about this is the question of whether you should wear a mask to protect yourself?
75,34,I think that you are overly critical of the CDC.
75,38,There are a lot of pranks and jokes about the CDC wanting to prevent a pandemic.
75,45,"If you think a party with a house full of people is a prank, why not just go to one and say what's wrong with the joke?"
75,48,"In this case, the answer is to wear a mask."
75,49,">Past a Mask"" was used to describe a pandemic. The term ""Past a Mask"" was used to describe a pandemic. The term ""Past a Mask"" was used to describe a pandemic."
75,55,"Is there anything more we could do to stop this pandemic in the CDC? I've heard people say something like ""You're not going to stop people from getting vaccinated, and I'm going to be able to tell you what you're going to do when I am not a doctor."" But that's all they were trying to convey and it was a joke."
75,59,"i dont get it, its not a prank, i don't think it's a joke. i'm not going to get hurt from having to wear a mask and I don't think it would even be a joke."
75,65,"As I see it, this is a joke, and I do not believe it is anything else. I believe that the CDC uses a lot of things to get vaccines for people whose papilloma can be prevented from spreading. They use a program to prevent pandemics, like what 'pattal pandemics' are. It's also a prank because it helps prevent AIDS."
75,71,"I’m not a doctor, but I can hardly see the difference. I’m not sure why the CDC should do something pranks like this. Is there a special way to prevent pandemics?"
76,75,I wear a mask because it prevents me from getting it. And then I go into a doctor's office to talk about how much they mean to the community about the vaccination and / or a medical professional and how it can help them avoid their vebb and their illnesses in the future. I want to stop I don't know how to explain this to you.
87,75,>I think that the CDC is doing more than just stop the spread of the AIDS virus.
90,75,It sounds like they are trying to get people to do something on the street.
100,75,"I mean... it would be cool if someone was able to come up with a valid reason why they don't wear a mask, but it would be weird that they wear a mask in the middle of the day because they have no idea what a python is."
