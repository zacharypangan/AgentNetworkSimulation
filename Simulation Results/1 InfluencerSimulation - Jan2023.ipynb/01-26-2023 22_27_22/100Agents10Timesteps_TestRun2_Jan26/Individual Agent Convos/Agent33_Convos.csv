33,5,This is why some of us can't go to the doctor
54,33,I don't care. I'm trying to go and I don't want to get vaccinated because I don't want to.
58,33,The problem is that the mask isn't a tool. The problem is that the government doesn't use it in a positive way and a liar thinks it's right to do it. The problem is that it's a tool for a liar's sake.

67,33,"No, people do not want to be vaccinated. The issue is that a person has no right to be vaccinated, or any right to be vaccinated, and it's not the same as getting a vaccine in the first place."

93,33,I don't think that's what it is.
99,33,The problem is that wearing a mask in the holidays can make you look unattractive and sexist. It's basically a kind of antisemitism. It makes you look more attractive and makes you look like you're not in that category.
33,1,... I've read the whole thing. I don't like that people wear masks. But I will go.
33,5,"It's like a rape movie, where they give people an immunity test to prevent an ebola virus."
54,33,I don't like the idea of being a politician.

99,33,"CDC has been able to explain how they are working to stop a virus from spreading around the world, which is a ridiculous statement."
33,1,"'He doesn't wear a mask, he's wearing an ass suit."
33,5,Why don't we just stop using masks and see if they actually can prevent ebola? It's a huge waste of money.

65,33,"I read it as, ""...the best way to prevent people from getting virus from your home is to wear a mask at all times. I think it is nice that they are doing what the government is doing and say they are not working, but not that they are doing it anyway."
67,33,"Well, it doesn't sound like a joke to me."
84,33,"I mean, it's not a virus, it's a medical condition and the government does not want it. This is not even a question about what you think about a person doing this. It's just an expression that people take for granted."
92,33,Why are you taking this comment as a joke?
93,33,"What is this article about? You're using it as a joke, and that's really messed up. It says it's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
99,33,"In my opinion, you should get a copy of the book. You can get the one with the book as a gift for yourself."
33,1,"I'm sorry but the guy that told this was a liar, and he's being a troll."
33,5,Viruses don't spread anywhere near the human body because it's not an immunization of one's body to be immune to them. People can't just stop using their masks for a few minutes because there are so many infected people out there.
54,33,Why did you want to hear this? It's a troll post and not something to be considered.
58,33,I am a doctor. I don't know why a bunch of people don't have a mask or it's just that it makes a lot of people angry and resentful. I don't know why people would wear it.
65,33,>Is the question about whether or not the government is supposed to be concerned about the safety of the population?
67,33,I thought it was funny that a doctor was wearing a mask at Christmas.
84,33,The NSA and the NSA are robbing you of your rights in order to prevent the spread of HIV and other diseases. They are doing this to get the government out of the public health system. The NSA is acting as a big threat.
92,33,"''I don't trust this vaccine i understand your concern for the residents of erie county i obey the mask mandate wash and sterilize my hands when returning home from work and elsewhere'', 'In the case of an old person, I can confirm that Mark and Mark both have snooped on the same person.''"
93,33,a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus
99,33,"So, why don't you go out and get a mask? Because they're supposed to help stop a virus that catches in people. Why don't you get a book with the book? Because that's a good idea."
33,1,"The only thing they are doing is being a dick to people, who are afraid of being a dick. They want to keep a person out of the system, to prevent the spread of a virus."
33,5,You could get a copy of this book as a gift or a book with the book. Because that's a good idea.
54,33,What's the point of a mask?
58,33,"I like to wear my mask in the shower, if you ask me."
65,33,"So, you're talking about the prank-based treatment of a sick person, not the death penalty if the person gets a mask."
67,33,"So, a doctor being cited for not wearing a mask at Christmas."
84,33,I agree that I do not care about the government. The fact that it is acting as a big threat has me confused.
92,33,"He is probably a hypocrite, but as a person with a high tolerance for the flu (the first few years of his life), it doesn't really make sense to have the snooping ad 'to the doctors' in the beginning."
93,33,I can't even guess which side it was but I would be surprised if the one in the first part wasn't a real one. The narcissist doesn't like this. It's like the kind of people I want to be the doctor who don't understand how a joke works.
99,33,It is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
33,1,"They are acting like a troll. I don't think there's a whole lot of evidence to be held that says that they're a troll, or even really interested in what the actual article actually says."
33,5,"In the book, he claims there is ""Material"" for all of these things."
54,33,I can see a lot of people not being able to make the right choice.
58,33,"I have some strangely retorts, but that I didn't see until I read it: ""You wear a mask in the shower"""
65,33,It's a joke. The prank is a joke. You don't read it.
67,33,Yes I agree with everyone who says the government is a joke and the UK is in it. The NSA is in a bit of a bind. I'm guessing there is an American person with a bad temper who wears a mask in order to prevent the spread of HIV.
84,33,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.If you feel this way, if the NSA is a big threat then you are probably right."
92,33,"""That's a joke, Mark! That's a joke!"" ""That's a joke, Mark! That's a joke, Mark!"""
93,33,">I wear a mask on a run. It's hard to tell when my face isn't shattered by a virus. I don't know why but this is why I can't get it. I've never been to the NSA or any other government agency, but it sounds like they're talking about a 'virus' that can spread over the nation. I think it's interesting that a lot of people are being manipulated to do this. It's just a joke,"
