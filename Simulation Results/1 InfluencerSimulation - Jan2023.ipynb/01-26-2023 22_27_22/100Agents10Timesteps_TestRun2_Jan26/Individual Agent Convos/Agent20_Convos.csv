34,20,"There is not a rule that prohibits people from running in a vaccinated condition. If you wear a mask or a non-vaccinated mask, it isn't likely that you will get sick. Vaccinations can be made out of many varying types of masks, from a simple mask to one that is completely unfit."
42,20,"You know how this works? Probably just a mask, i've got one now in my car that s not visible to me so if it's in my face it can be a bit rough and rough"

97,20,ain't nobody getting sick
20,2,"This isn't even true. The CDC isn't a vaccine for the 'Sepsis', and a health care agency is putting a'sensitization' program into place for the victims."
20,5,"I just realized that if you have a helmet that comes with a mask, it needs to have a bit of an sleeve."
23,20,So you wear a mask at the movies?
32,20,I don't know if it's the problem I was trying to resolve at work.
34,20,"Vaccinations can be made out of many varying types of masks, from a simple mask to one that is completely unfit. Wearing a mask and keeping distance is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
42,20,"There are plenty of signs of cocidivism in the US (not only that it has a low chance of passing through, but also that it can suffocate your immune system), so maybe this is an averted issue."
60,20,"I'm really sorry but I also don't think people would ever be able to use the words ""medical mask"" or ""medical mask"". This seems to me to be a pretty ambiguous post."
64,20,"Apparently this can be related to the 'inhibition of public use of a mask'movement, as well as the 'inhibition of government use of a mask'movement."
65,20,"We essentially need to be wearing a mask to protect ourselves from HIV, not the spread of it. Until it becomes apparent that it is a problem with health, we just need to remember to wear masks."
75,20,"In the U.S., it's mandatory to get a mask to prevent pandemics. I don't think it's a joke. I do think a mask does have a role in stopping the spread of a virus."
84,20,he can fuck that...
86,20,"I am not a big fan of this. I do know that a bit of this stuff has a very good reason. That said, I am not really sure why you think people are over reacting to this kind of thing."
97,20,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
20,2,"I also don't think people would ever be able to use the words ""medical mask"" or ""medical mask"". This seems to me to be a pretty ambiguous post."
20,5,"That's a very good point. There are so many vaccines for a vaccinated patient with HIV. If I remember correctly, these are called'medical masks'."
23,20,"I know a good santa, but we don't have to wear masks. You can't be a patriot without a mask. If you don't get vaccinated you can't be a patriot without a mask."
32,20,I don't have the information I need to get through the government to stop a virus.
34,20,Is this the first time someone said this??
42,20,"OP, I agree with most of the commenters."
60,20,This seems to me to be a pretty ambiguous post.
64,20,The American public has never been more willing to accept a mask. It isn't an acceptable way to do it.
65,20,This is just my personal opinion. What you are saying is exactly what I'm saying.
75,20,"It's a problem. If I had to change the mask, I would wear it at all times. I don't think that's a joke. I'm just letting people know my jokes and it really makes me feel like a failure."
84,20,He can't fuck that.
86,20,"I'm sorry if I am wrong, but I don't think it would be much easier for us to break the law and act like a socialist if they didn't use it."
97,20,I haven't heard of this before.
20,2,It's a joke.
20,5,I don't care what they think about the world if I don't have a mask...
23,20,... and what do you think they think?
32,20,"Almost everyone else on this subreddit is still using ""Palm-and-Lock-and-Roll"". I think this is the correct response. Whenever someone complains about a politician, the president should call them out on the video."
34,20,"Is there a CDC-endorsed safety protocol for making your skin visible when you wear a mask? ""I can't wear a mask"" is a word used in many different contexts."
42,20,You're right. And we're not going to stop... and you're going to start the next one.
60,20,"I'm going to have to stop using it here for a second, as this is the first post I've seen."
64,20,This is all about people who are really into the world - they're so fucking brave that they can't even stand the thought of wearing a mask.
65,20,I like how it's being a part of the government.
75,20,"I'm actually gonna leave my papilloma and go to a party, I am going to be the one to come in."
84,20,"I would definitely tell her to wear a face mask, because it's a sign of a virus."
86,20,"I have to say that my favorite part of the NSA is how the media is about the NSA. I see a lot of r/news articles that say a lot of the NSA propaganda is about ""walking masks "" and the NSA is talking about it. I do not see that a lot of people are blatantly stating they're the people who are making the propaganda."
97,20,The most important thing here is to take this information seriously. It isn't a logical thing to say but it is a good point. You're gonna have to give your mask to a man you don't want to be with. And I'd wear a mask if he had a phobia about it. And I'd wear a mask if he had a phobia about it. Wearing a mask helps in stopping the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask helps in stopping the spread of a virus.
20,2,This is a joke. It's not a joke. I've seen that.

34,20,I'm sure we have some form of mask if we want to prevent the spread of viruses in the future.
42,20,> If a doctor decided to vaccinate a child they wouldn't have any problem with it.
60,20,"I read this as a person who could wear a mask if he didn't have a mask on. I thought he was saying people should wear a mask, to prevent the spread of a virus, so he said ""We should wear a mask"""
64,20,"It's a simple concept, but it's not that big of a deal. People wear masks to stop people getting sick. The problem isn't their health, it's not their ability to communicate what they know, so it's not a big deal."
65,20,[The government](http://www.mhsid.gov/) wears a mask to help prevent the spread of HIV (also known as a HIV clone) which is the symptom of HIV. That mask is the official anti-HIV mask that the government is distributing.
75,20,"It's the kind of joke a good doctor would think people who were going to have it will do and say to all a couple people if they didn't wear a mask, it's a prank that they are being silly about and it makes you feel bad for having it."
84,20,"[Hey, I just want to tell you that it’s a sign of a virus. I don’t know how anyone will be able to see how I feel without it. [It’s just a sign of a virus. [It’s really a shame they took you to a drive-up test. Then I’m late, because I’m in a hurry. I’m in a hurry. I don’t want to take a drive-up test."
86,20,"You're right, we're just blatantly stating that you're the people who are making the propaganda."
97,20,You could wear a syringe while getting a lot of ticks. It's a bit more complicated than that.
20,2,Isn't a mask a form of a mask?
20,5,"Yes. And yes, the mask is needed for the vaccine, the vaccine must be worn in a position to prevent the spread of the virus."
23,20,"Vaccinations are very important and I believe there is a lot of scientific research on how to stop the spread of mumps. It is not a good idea, it's just a good idea. You get a little bit of fun out of that. You can wear a mask, but it does not prevent any disease."
32,20,The only way to prevent a virus outbreak is to help your husband.
34,20,"I'm afraid I'm being off-balance by being a prankster. I feel bad for the CDC, and for a lot of the other things that I know from the CDC."
42,20,> If a doctor decided to vaccinate a child they wouldn't have any problem with it.
60,20,"I don't think it's anything special to wear a mask while sick, just the way you say it."
64,20,"I mean, I'm not saying it is not a big deal. My point is, it's very important to not put it to people because of the stigma associated with it and in this case, because it doesn't imply anything to them, but rather how to tell people what is in a public forum. If a commenter is saying a question to me, then I don't know if I have the right to respond."
65,20,So there's this guy who likes to wear a mask in public but you think that the best way to prevent the spread of the virus is to wear a mask?
75,20,I'm getting some new questions every day.
84,20,And he’s using the word “event” for the whole thing.
86,20,"I've always felt like this is why people feel like they have to be afraid of being stung by a virus.... And then the NSA says, ""Waving a mask or helmet that will protect us from corona and that everyone would have to wear to go outside for a month or that would allow us to open up the economy again. I don't think the government is really doing any good. They're just telling the truth. I don't think the government is really doing any good. They're just telling the truth."
97,20,I'm not sure you understand the meaning of that. Is there a difference in the meaning of it?
20,2,A prankster? Not really a joke. A prankster??
20,5,It's a very important concept.
23,20,I was a child. I'm not sure how to express myself like that. I'm just trying to express my feelings about something I didn't know I was doing. I grew up with a really serious problem with. It's almost like I'm not very good at it.
32,20,"This is what I read. Whenever someone complains about a politician, the president should call them out on the video."
34,20,It's just a prank. People have no idea what it is.
42,20,"If you're going to try to avoid an outbreak, you should definitely seek advice from someone who tries to save you and you want to help."
60,20,Vaccination is the quickest and most effective cure for a virus. It works great when you're not in the flu.
64,20,... I can tell you the thing that has happened in my life - what if I wear a mask or a hat to get me sick?
65,20,"OP - [In order to prevent HIV, the government should be wearing a mask. It will prevent a virus from entering your home or from your home."""
75,20,"Well, there is one other thing I can say, that I think a good doctor would think people who are going to have it will do. I'm not sure, in my country, people will just use a mask. I feel like if you have a papilloma, I would go to a party with a mask on and don't have it. I know there is a CDC/disease-matter-failures-and-vaccinations.html site, it's a very real problem."
84,20,"I'm sure you will agree with everyone else here, but your wife will still have to wear a mask."
86,20,They could even make the NSA remove the airspace cloak from the public eye and rename it to the new one that supposedly prevents a mass spread of virus.
97,20,"I don't like a lot of sexist jokes. I don't like a lot of sexist jokes, but I would love to be a part of the virus."
20,2,I'm a little confused.
20,5,I'm afraid my health isn't good enough.
23,20,Vaccination is not a good idea.
32,20,[NAME] was the first person to actually mention it.
34,20,[NAME]: I don't know any more. I can't believe the CDC is using the same jokes to get more people sick. I think it's a joke.
42,20,"> Vaccinating a child is a big, serious mistake. I think the way to prevent it would be to put a mask on yourself because it would be a sign that you are exposing a child to a new form of HIV."
60,20,The medical community and the government are both trying to stop the spread of this virus. A virus is inherently dangerous and we can't prevent it.
64,20,"As a person who has never been more willing to accept a mask as a joke, I can tell you the fact that there's a huge difference between wearing a mask and trying to fuck someone who isn't going to be in a very long time. Hence my dislike of the word ""empathy mask""."
65,20,>Is the question about whether or not the government is supposed to be concerned about the safety of the population?
75,20,I'm an AIDS patient. I have my own Papilloma and I have an annual exam to find out if a friend has it. I think you are right that it is very common to have a papilloma.
84,20,The NSA can't force you to wear a mask when you get sick. There's an easy reason for it - that's a medical condition and the government isn't willing to take you for a virus test.
86,20,"I want to say, 'You know what they're saying, I can't help but feel like you're telling me what I know, I think it is just telling the truth'."
97,20,... because when you put a mask on it helps stop the spread of a virus. I'm going to guess wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. I'm going to guess wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
20,2,">I'm so sorry mark but i don't trust this vaccine i understand your concern for the residents of erie county i obey the mask mandate wash and sterilize my hands when returning home from work and elsewhere', ""Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
20,5,What's this? The joke?
23,20,"Yeah, 'I was a child with a very serious problem with. It's almost like I'm not very good at it. I grew up with a really serious problem with. I'm just trying to express my feelings. I'm just trying to express my feelings about something I didn't know I was doing."
32,20,He wasn't claiming the government was a problem. It was his prank.
34,20,I think the only joke I get out of this is that the CDC has some form of safety protocol where you can be seen by a mask. I like it because it's easy to get sick and the CDC knows everything about it.
42,20,">Making me wear a mask at work can make a person sick, but it does not prevent you from catching the virus."
60,20,"I'm not a doctor, I'm an advocate for using the word ""abuse"" to make fun of the government."
64,20,"You mean the NSA has done wrong things, but op is a troll?"
65,20,It sounds like the article is misleading and a bit about the government that needs to have an anti-vaccine campaign in order to have a prank on someone.
75,20,"""If I had to change the mask, I would wear it at all times. I don't think that's a joke."""
84,20,>They are trying to stop the spread of a virus and will extort money away from the people that actually need to buy it.'
86,20,"I know this is a bit strange, but the question I want to ask is whether there is any legitimate interest in this particular kind of thing, or if this could happen. What if I were a doctor and the NSA did anything to stop the spread of a virus, that would make me an agnostic for a year. Then there would be some unwarranted, unfounded and insincere accusations of conspiracy to prevent it. I think I could see it coming."
97,20,>I'm going to guess wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
20,2,>The medical community and the government are both trying to stop the spread of this virus. A virus is inherently dangerous and we can't prevent it.
20,5,"[This is where I started looking for a way to make fun of the govt, and how they are trying to take some of this prank out on you.](http://www.mjs.com/ag/egjcf-rivt-whii.htm)."
23,20,I am sure he is a bit of a jerk because he can't be offended.
32,20,"Aye if you are a doctor and have a virus, you can still use a mask on your feet. Then it will also kill you if you are wearing it while driving."
34,20,You can't be a prankster and still get sick. We do not use masks. We need the money.
42,20,This is a lot like how the US 'proposed' to get the exemption.
60,20,"I would like to clarify. I think you mean this as ""I want to wear a mask""?"
64,20,"If that's what you mean, then it's not a joke."
65,20,"In short, it's not a joke, it's the prank that's gonna cause the people of Texas to think that they are stupid and that they can't wear them anymore."
75,20,I can tell you a lot about the papilloma joke.
84,20,"This is the first time someone in this thread has asked you to wear a mask, and you asked them to stop. That's a bit of a fucking lie."
86,20,People need to stop wearing a mask and talk about it for hours before going outside.
97,20,I know a lot of people who hate it.
