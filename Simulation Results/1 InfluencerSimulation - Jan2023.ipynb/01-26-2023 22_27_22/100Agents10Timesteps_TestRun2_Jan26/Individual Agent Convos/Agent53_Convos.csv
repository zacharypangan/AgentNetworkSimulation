64,53,really interesting in light of people s resistance to wear a mask both the mask and the shopping cart are measurements of empathy
65,53,as uncomfortable as it may be especially with the conditions we work in i d rather adapt wear the mask and survive than contract the virus bc of what s more comfortable
93,53,excellent exandle of the importance and reliance of everyone in the community to do their part the people that put themselves at risk everyday so you can have food safely produced and delivered to you to eat it s not hard to wear a mask on a run
53,16,It's very cool to know that the idea of wearing a mask is not so much the problem as the cure.
53,32,I think the fact that people have to wear masks during the day can be helpful in keeping a person from getting a cold.
53,35,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
53,43,i wear a mask everyday and have it on all the time i can t see or shave anything even though it only lasts so i m pretty sure it is not required but the first thing i do is make sure that i have an earplug if i m not wearing a mask lol
53,52,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
64,53,"It's because we don't eat and drink from our masks. I don't eat the food we use, but I do get the food we use in it."
65,53,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
93,53,And the mask on the run is an important part of preventing spread of disease - removing the virus. It focuses on a certain group of people that can help them by preventing the spread of the disease and then helping them avoid the virus.
53,16,The most important part of the conversation is the wording.
53,32,I would be surprised to know that this is true. If I were to say this I would have to be very happy with my health unless I had a really long time ago.
53,35,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
53,43,"Well i have a feeling we are living in a world where i don't have to live because i don't eat and drink from my masks. I don't eat the food we use, but I do get the food we use in it."
53,52,"I have a shave for two months, but it doesn't last long enough. I usually brush it out and have it at night. And I do have a bunch of scar tissue. And I do a lot of my hair."
64,53,"Obviously, there is a very different definition of ""empathy"" in the American political context."
65,53,> Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
93,53,Wearing a mask on the run is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
53,16,"We should do the same thing when we work in a group of people. In the American context, I think that the fact that people have to wear a mask during the day can be helpful in keeping a person from getting a cold. It's because we don't eat and drink from our masks. I don't eat the food we use, but I do get the food we use in it."
53,32,It's really a great article. The most important part of the conversation is the wording. It's interesting to know that the idea of wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
53,35,"So that's just the point of the article. Hopefully, you've had a decent amount of time to reflect and pause when you say that a ""mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. """
53,43,The wording I am insinuating has nothing to do with the whole context of what this article is about. It's not a good statement.
53,52,We're all human - so we all need the right to feel safe and not get caught. We all have the right to feel comfortable. We all have the right to feel comfortable in whatever way we feel comfortable with.
64,53,A friend of mine has this thing on his phone. I use it at least once a week when I'm not wearing a mask.
65,53,"I don't like wearing a mask in public. My husband and I would take our mask off when we walked in the doorways of our apartment building, so that they could wear it."
93,53,"I mean, the guy that said ""I like"" wearing a mask on a run."
53,16,"Probably why the US has a very high rate of viruses. If we can prevent the spread of a virus, it isn't going to change."
53,32,I’m in the US. I’m a doctor. I can’t do the right things. I can’t do the right things. I’m on the autism spectrum.
53,35,"I mean a shave for 2 months screams ""do not eat the food we use"", and it screams ""don't eat"" but I do get the food we use in it."
53,43,"Yes, a bit of a troll here, but that's not what's really important."
53,52,I'm not a big fan of removing a mask when my skin gets infected by a virus. But I think it's more like a blanket.
64,53,"It's a simple concept for people to express themselves, but it's just a small part of being a human being. I'm sure it's pretty easy to understand why people don't go to school wearing a mask. It's a lot of people that are sabotage python and who never get sick of wearing them."
65,53,I'm a medical professional. This isn't the type of thing that you would want to hear from someone who was a medical professional.
93,53,"I don't think the government has anything to do with this, I just think it's an interesting perspective on how people are influenced by a lot of things. I'm not a big fan of the government, but I do like the idea that we can stop the spread of a virus."
53,16,"> Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. I have a shave for two months, but it doesn't last long enough."
53,32,"In some ways I'm going to make this a ""true"" statement about how ""un-safe people"" are if it's ""comfortable and sanitary."""
53,35,I'm not saying it's a bad thing. I'm just saying it's a great point of view and I think the question isn't how we can be trusted with a mask. I'm not in the US. I'm a doctor. I can't do the right things.
53,43,I was the one who put in the mask and said that the whole sex act was a bad idea and I don't think they should make them do it anyways. I'm not sure what is wrong with this but I think a lot of people like that.
53,52,We can all have the right to feel comfortable in whatever way we feel comfortable with.
64,53,"There's a reason why it's not in the title. I don't like the idea of a ""sad person"" going to school. If that's the case, it's an excuse to keep working and not go to school with a mask."
65,53,"I'm a doctor and I have a lot of experience with doctors in the hospital, where I try to protect myself, but I feel that when I don't have a properly fitted mask I tend to wear it. I'm not sure why I'd even be comfortable with it because there's no obvious way for me to prevent it, but it can prevent the spread of a virus. I've never had the urge to have a mask in my life. It's not something I think anyone should have to wear."
93,53,"Using that quote in an article was not a joke, rather it was a part of the article. It is a joke. This is not what a joke is."
53,16,I'm a physician. I have a mask and I wear it every day and not much else. I have to use it every day to be safe.
53,32,This is what I read. I just saw some trolls talking about this at work that hid it from their children.
53,35,"I'm also on the autism spectrum and wear a mask when I'm at work, and the kids I've seen wearing a mask are going to look disgusting at me and be on drugs."
53,43,I can't see a 'troll here' in a joke describing the sex act itself. It's all about the sex act. There is no way in hell you can be an sex killer without going through the hassle of being forced into it. It's about a troll with a great point of view.
53,52,"I know you're not sure what you mean but you're right that ""as in, if I ever went to school with a shave for 2 months i would be really sick to my face."""
64,53,"Wearing a mask in order to stop the spread of a virus is a part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.It's a simple concept, but it's not that big of a deal. People wear masks to stop people getting sick. The problem isn't their health, it's not their ability to communicate what they know, so it's not a big deal."
65,53,"I would read your article as, a joke"
93,53,"I like the joke, and I adore it."
53,16,"People wear masks to stop people getting sick because they are protected, but it is not the same as being sick because they can't go to school with a mask. There is no way in hell people can be an sex killer without going through the hassle of being forced into it."
53,32,"I know what you mean, but what was the issue?"
53,35,What if I went to school a day in a mask and felt sick?
53,43,"I mean... it's not really a joke but it's a joke. A good point of view, not a joke. I'd read your article as, a joke, and I adore it."
53,52,Isn't a facial mask necessary to stop a virus?
64,53,A lot of people are going to tell you that a mask is a joke and you don't want to wear it. I think it is a good thing we all live in a vacuum. I've read all sorts of things about how that sounds.
65,53,This is a really good point.
93,53,"I think there's a big distinction between the first two syllables. The first one is called ""Alright "" because it's about how people are influenced by a lot of things."
53,16,It's a joke.
53,32,I don't understand your stance on this.
53,35,I read the comment about a faked shave for two months and it was on par with a joke and I never said it was a joke.
53,43,"It's not a joke, it's just not a very relevant one to make in your context."
53,52,"In order to stop the spread of a virus people wear a mask and then go to school without it. So there is no way to stop a virus, you don't have to do anything but try."
64,53,"I think the OP is very happy that the government is making it so, because it's not a joke."
65,53,"I’m not even gonna go into details about how it would affect your bodega, but it would be very difficult for a health professional to tell you. I wouldn’t have been able to tell you, since the only way they have figured out is to use a mask that they wouldn’t normally wear."
93,53,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. Is a mask part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus?
53,16,">""As in, if I ever went to school with a shave for 2 months i would be really sick to my face."""
53,32,It's one of the most interesting articles on the internet.
53,35,"""Mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I know you're not sure what you mean but you're right that ""as in, if I ever went to school with a shave for 2 months i would be really sick to my face."""
53,43,"""I don't see a troll here, but I do get the food we use in it."""
53,52,I thought this was some sort of joke.
64,53,"This is why I think the NSA should stop taking away the power of those masks. They do so to protect the public. Hence, I think that you should consider that as a part of the effort to get a good mask on people."
65,53,It was a joke. The article was made to show people the prank was a prank.
93,53,... and the person that says 'I'm not a big fan of the government' and then go on about how the joke is funny.
53,16,It's about how people are influenced by a lot of things.
53,32,It seems a lot of people are attempting to make the joke a joke - and there's nothing wrong with it.
53,35,"I'm not sure if the word ""shave"" is even the same as ""I don't often have time to shave my face stubble in the morning luckily coronavirus is very accepting of mask culture so actually it s required."""
53,43,... and the person that says 'I'm not a big fan of the government' and then go on about how the joke is funny.
53,52,It's probably a prank but it is not funny.
64,53,[NAME] - You're a huge python..
65,53,"What a prank. And then why was it a joke? You need to see an article on ""The Penguin Prank"", by a lawyer who was involved with the prank."
93,53,"I don't think it's a joke, because it makes the joke sound like a joke."
