66,12,"It's not as if someone wearing a mask doesn 't deserve a fight - that's not what it's all about - it just reminds me that it's a big deal that people are always wearing a mask to protect themselves from the flu. You're being racist and you are ignoring it - it is a very important and important part of healthcare. It does make me feel uncomfortable and it makes me uncomfortable, but it also makes me feel like a kid that they were vaccinated, which I do now"
66,24,I see it as a really good idea for you to keep your head down on your face when you are vaccinated because you want the public to feel better and can be informed about the threat to others.
66,30,Vaccination is a necessary health policy and you need to be vigilant and act with caution.
66,55,If you can get my rabid kids around you with a mask you should definitely consider that.
67,66,i think it is a valid question to ask someone why they are doing something that makes them feel safe? why they don't like doing things like that when they aren't doing it properly?
70,66,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.as encouraging as this news is please remember that this new cdc guideline still calls for wearing masks in federal facilities including airports mask wearing vaccinated or not is still required at syr and all u s airports as encouraging as this news is please remember that this new cdc guideline still calls for wearing masks in federal facilities including airports mask wearing vaccinated or not is still required at syr and all

66,12,Ahhh I get it. The cdc has no authority to make the people wear a mask and are also not allowed to use them.
66,24,"As a Republican with a huge and large political party, I can safely say I don't believe the president that he's been vaccinated in one form or another."

70,66,"That's pretty crazy. I'm actually a bit of a vebbulldog, so i’m definitely going to wear a mask."
87,66,"You're a very ill person and the idea of vaccinating people is very interesting. I had no idea people would actually have the same problems as me, it's like being in an environment where I wouldn't ever feel safe and I didn't feel safe at all."

99,66,I like this movie a lot. I really don't care what you do here.
66,12,">""Ahhh I get it. The cdc has no authority to make the people wear a mask and are also not allowed to use them."
66,24,So I've just got a mask and a vaccination.
66,30,"When a sane and competent doctor decides to remove a mask, a good doctor will put in a new one so they can prevent it from spreading. A good doctor will let a person stay at a hospital for 2 months, and they're going to have a better chance at finding the proper vaccine."
66,55,In addition to the massive covids I have mentioned on this sub... santa should have a mask. Ahhh I get it. The cdc has no authority to make the people wear a mask and are also not allowed to use them.
67,66,There is an American wiki entry on that.
70,66,"Vaccines are not mandatory in many countries, but some will even have them."
87,66,"This isn't a rant, it's an honest conversation."

66,12,">I'm actually a bit of a vebbulldog, so I’m definitely going to wear a mask."
66,24,"I have a lot of friends with asthma, and they have been vaccinated. It is like saying 'if they could stop spreading the virus, they'd like to do it.'Is this a good idea?"
66,30,"The movie, starring Donald Trump, explains that the federal government has no authority to make people wear a mask. And I cite it because I believe the CDC doesn't use the term ""vaccine"" in the words of the wiki entry."
66,55,"I'm a Republican, and this was the first movie I read."
67,66,I thought it was a joke but it isn't.
70,66,"You gotta work a lot. If you want to get sick without a mask and there is no vaccination, you need to use a mask and have a mask on."

99,66,'Putin's a mask is supposed to help prevent the spread of a virus.
66,12,"It is very possible that Donald Trump is referring to the vaccine in a humorous and well written way, but you're not going to be able to tell us the exact line of the post."
66,24,">I'm actually a bit of a vebbulldog, so I'm definitely going to wear a mask."
66,30,The CDC has the authority to force people to wear masks in cases like this. It doesn't need to be a joke. It needs to be part of the policy.
66,55,"What's the point of the movie? If he's a vebbulldog he's not a virus in a mask. I don't want to help you with that, but you're the only one who has been able to stop this spread of a virus."
67,66,"I think there is no need to do the ""joke"" stuff about a vaccine in a public school. I'm sorry but I'm not in the minority -"
70,66,"I don't like a vebb and I don't wear a mask on my birthday, because I don't want a big tummy to see me around, and because of my skin, and my hair."
87,66,"I was wondering why this is going to be a rant, not a joke."
90,66,"It's pretty typical slapstick joke. It's so cute. I don't think they understand how to tell you. Is it a prank that you are referring to? What kind of prank is it? What kind of prank is it? Is there any way to tell someone in front of your face. You have to show someone who's not in the video to do what you want them to do. It's called a ""route"", a rehash of a rehash of a rehash of"

99,66,"If Santa wasn't wearing a mask, I'd be just as angry and resentful about it as I am for it."
66,12,I feel like my resentment and frustration will make them even worse. I'm not going to stop wearing a mask on my birthday. It's the first time my husband has been to a public school.
66,24,"I’m glad you can understand how a prank is a joke. The CDC doesn’t have a duty to force people to wear a mask, so they don’t make a prank about it."
66,30,"I can tell you a lot about the subject matter, albeit by way of humor."
66,55,"That sounds pretty awesome, ya know."
67,66,"CANNOTANSWER - ''I've seen an article a couple times about the issue of how people can be vaccinated. They are not supposed to wear them as a reason, because they aren't allowed to use them as a way to prevent the spread of a virus. They need to see a doctor about it."

66,24,"What is the point of using a mask on a veb bulldog, it is a prank to get them to wear a mask on a veb bulldog, a veb bulldog to avoid the spread of a virus."
66,30,"This is a really good point. But, I'm going to be a bit more critical in my explanation. The problem is, we're not just speaking in terms of the government, we're talking about the federal government."
66,55,Are you the one who doesn't get why a prank is a prank? I don't understand why people think the CDC should force people to wear a mask for the sake of preventing a virus.
67,66,"I'd say there isn't an ""ideal joke"" to talk about, or more likely to not make it at all. If it is, I'm pretty sure you'd just get a little nervous if you read the article and just assume people don't know how to deal with it and if they're not willing to talk with you."
70,66,"The CDC should make it a ""must be vaccinated"" policy."
87,66,Is there a way to 'warn' people not to wear the mask?

66,55,There is a lot of nonsense on that sub.
67,66,"I'm not a doctor, but I don't really like the notion that people should wear a mask. They are not required to wear them for that reason, but I find it somewhat funny when a friend of mine comes in with a bad case of cannomena's, ""I wear a mask while vaccinated."""

99,66,It's a terrible idea that I don't like and the article says that it's just the same.
66,12,"I like the idea of wearing a mask while vaccinating my kids, but I think the entire idea is ridiculous, and it's not like there's any way it's not possible for people to wear it, and it's a prank. Basically, the problem is if you aren't a doctor, you don't even need to wear a mask, it's just a prank, and it's a prank."
66,24,"I want to tell you this, I'm not a doctor and I'm not a doctor. I don't believe in a mask."
66,30,I can't imagine the people at a hospital asking about it being a prank. Isn't it just about making it seem like a joke.
66,55,"Vaccination is a great way to prevent the spread of viruses in your family, and it's really important to keep them away from you. If you think they are the good ones, you have to do something about it, and you have to stay away from those that have already tried to protect themselves. I suggest that you avoid putting yourself at risk and are prepared to work towards finding a way to prevent that."
67,66,"This is how you make a joke about vaccination. In the UK, they're only allowed to use the doctor's office. It's called a ""devil's job"" and it's a part of the government's mandate to keep people alive."

87,66,Vaccination is a non-AIDS virus. They are still doing something to prevent it from spreading.

99,66,The CDC and the CDC are all at fault for the CDC's failure to stop the spread of a virus.
66,12,"""I want to tell you this, I'm not a doctor and I'm not a doctor. I want to tell you this, I'm not a doctor and I'm not a doctor."
66,24,"The CDC is not in charge of preventing the spread of the virus, and the CDC should not be involved in the vaccination of people with AIDS."
66,30,"I can understand why people would be confused when this happens. That's one thing he did, and it's the other that is hilarious. He said ""If they don't have a vaccine they can't do that."""
66,55,It's just a prank. It doesn't need to be funny. It needs to be a prank. The problem is that the CDC has no authority to make the people wear a mask.
67,66,It seems that the government has a huge problem with public health awareness. What's important is the privacy of the public.
70,66,"We don't like to put a mask on because it's too scary or inappropriate for children, and I don't like the idea that it's the only way to prevent that from happening."
87,66,I don't think it's possible that people are being sarcastic or offensive about the government. It's a joke. People are wearing masks because it prevents them from getting the flu.
90,66,...but then they're going to say 'no i don't think it's much better for them to just take the slapstick on and do the pranks with the mask they're being given?'
