42,24,It is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
42,27,No. What's wrong with a helmet when you haven't been tested to be vaccinated? A helmet is a part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
42,30,Why would you need to wear a mask if you are not sure if you are actually vaccinated?
42,31,"It's kinda funny how so many people are using the term 'wearing a mask' to mean ""wearing a mask"" - it's called something like ""wearing a mask and if you can get vaccinated"""
44,42,The government has a lot to say.
62,42,You seem to be the only one wearing a mask that helps stop the spread of the virus.

42,3,You're right. And we're not going to stop... and you're going to start the next one.
42,20,"OP, I agree with most of the commenters."
42,24,The best way to stop the spread of a virus is by trying to prevent its spread in your own body
42,27,This is the most logical response to this article.
42,30,I was very lucky that my brother had a std for the first time in his entire life.
42,31,"Because it's not a thing, it's the government's policy."
44,42,"In the US, we have a bunch of laws against wearing a mask. The government doesn't actually have that right."
62,42,"I like to wear a mask because I can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows', ""Is there anything i can do if i'm feeling scared?"""
78,42,"Unless he's wearing a mask, he can't do anything about it. If he's taking it off, he hasn't had a chance to prove it, because there is no evidence he's not an American citizen, which is how he gets his shit together."
84,42,... This is where the problem lies.
87,42,i would wear a mask for the vaccination
91,42,"In my experience, if we're going to have a major government government war I'd probably look into changing to the government's stance against terrorism and the like - that's an awful premise - they would do a huge favor by not getting into the ""open for public play"" business."
95,42,So you think we can only hope to save a few lives in a few years if a doctor decides to vaccinate a child who is young?
42,3,"I think the 'doctor is doing something wrong' thing in terms of not trying to stop the spread of a virus is the most logical response to this article. I've seen plenty of people get their heads blown out by people who don't wear helmets :("", ""You're right. And we're not going to stop... and you're going to start the next one."""
42,20,You're right. And we're not going to stop... and you're going to start the next one.
42,24,I've been wearing a mask for the first time in my entire life. It was an extremely scary experience.
42,27,There are a lot of people that think that a helmet should help stop the spread of a virus. They believe that a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
42,30,"""It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
42,31,"People in this sub tend to think that if the government decided to vaccinate a child they wouldn't have any problem with it. In my experience, if a doctor decided to vaccinate a child he could easily have an infection. I would not vaccinate a child with HIV unless the doctor decided to make it a ""prisonable"" situation."
44,42,You're right to be concerned. I have a friend who is really sick of this. She's really sick of this.
62,42,"He said that it's not necessary to wear a mask and didn't say ""you could wear one if you wanted"", so he has to wear it. It seems like he's trying to avoid it. Is there any other reason he was wearing a mask? He was not in that position in the first place."
78,42,"I'm not one of the stupid, ignorant and sexist people, but I do understand that if you're talking about the government being in charge of preventing the spread of a virus it's really not necessary to wear a mask. It's a way of showing how you feel and how a person has a responsibility."
84,42,I'd be okay with a face mask if I were your wife. I'd be okay with her having a face mask. I'd take it off and it's your wife. I'd be okay with her getting an allergy check done. Until that time you have to wear a mask. I'm not even familiar with this one and I don't know if you can get a nose.
87,42,I have a bad fever so I'm wearing a mask. It's my job to prevent it.
91,42,This is about how government and private entities create and protect their own people.

42,20,> If a doctor decided to vaccinate a child they wouldn't have any problem with it.
42,24,"This sub has been r/advice a while, but have some insights here. The underlying point here is that you're not talking about the right to wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus. In my opinion if it were the government, then we would just have the ""government is trying to stop the spread of a virus"" scenario that the person in question does not care about and the ""public play"" is not what you have. If it were me, I'd say that if I were wearing a mask, I'd tell the doctor or"
42,27,This is the best way to answer the question that is posed by an author that I know nothing about.
42,30,I'm not sure how people who are so concerned about vaccinating people will respond to the kind of posts that just rant. I'm a woman and vaccinated all my life.

44,42,If a government mandates that they do that then they can make sure they are doing it so that they can help keep it up and to prevent a new outbreak.

42,24,I think there is a underlying idea that people are going to make excuses for not wearing a mask.
42,27,You said you were in charge of preventing the spread of a virus. You're right to be concerned.
42,30,That's not the whole point.
42,31,This is a very big thing.
44,42,"Wearing a mask at work can make a person sick, but it does not prevent you from catching the virus. Unless it's the flu. I am a woman, I am so sorry that you need to get an eviction."
62,42,"I was talking to a man who was an expert on anti-viral medication, but he said something like, ""It's the way you have to be to not wear a mask on a plane."""
78,42,"I mean, it's pretty clear that you're not sure the whole point of this post is that you're just trying to make a point. It was only about the government, not you. People shouldn't be able to wear a mask. That's just how things are done."

42,3,So what if the government actually wants to do something that protects the public or stops it?
42,20,"If you're going to try to avoid an outbreak, you should definitely seek advice from someone who tries to save you and you want to help."
42,24,"Vaccinating a child is a big, serious mistake. I think the way to prevent it would be to put a mask on yourself because it would be a sign that you are exposing a child to a new form of HIV. I would say go for it. It's probably not worth the risk."
42,27,It's a big deal that there is an article on the internet that doesn't state this. The problem is with people who think that people shouldn't be able to wear a mask. It's just a little vague.
42,30,"I am in Florida and my mom and grandmother have been doing this to me. I was being vaccinated with one of the anti virologic medicines and they were able to help vaccinate me when I wasn't wearing a mask. The first time I was in Florida, I did it out of sheer curiosity."
42,31,"This is a big thing. People aren't just asking to put out a mask, they are requesting to be vaccinated to prevent a viral outbreak, and a few of them are asking for a medical exemption. You can't do this without being vaccinated. That's not the issue. People do not just think a mask is a good idea. People do not vaccinate themselves. But there are people who don't think a mask is a good idea."
44,42,"Almost any government program has to offer some kind of vaccine, as long as there are none that are bad or infected. You need to change your mask to one that is on a table, with a mirror on it."
62,42,It's easy to be suspicious of something that you can't fully know about. Hopefully it works for you and you don't get a sick veet to eat on your way out and it will save you some life!

87,42,>I'm a doctor and vaccinated with the AIDS virus. Wearing a mask outside while vaccinated is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
91,42,"I know many of the stuff you've written but I know that they're saying it because ""I don't think you are going to come across as a python. You need to really think about why you need to put out a mask to stop the spread of a virus."""
95,42,"In the huffs and puffs, the huffs can be pushed on the mask's ear if they wear it or not."
42,3,"You're a little confused about the context, but the whole idea of putting on a mask in order to stop the spread of HIV is just a big mistake. It's not a very good idea. Vaccinating a child with HIV, which is a very small part of the spread, is a huge mistake, not a very smart one. It's one of the biggest mistakes the government has made in terms of preventing a virus from spreading."

42,30,"Yes, the people should be vaccinated to prevent a virus. The health care system is the one that's at risk for developing HIV."

44,42,"They are not. They are being called the ""cynical idiots of America."
62,42,I am an anti-virus activist.
78,42,That is a really dumb idea. What I'm saying is that it's an important part of the government's work to stop the spread of a virus. The people in Texas have no legal right to wear a mask. They can't wear a mask during Christmas and they cannot have the right to wear a mask.
84,42,>(http://www.nihilist.com/articles/38790.html) he says people who wear a mask do so because they are uncomfortable.
87,42,"The CDC is doing more than just stop the spread of the AIDS virus. It's not that the government is sarcastic or offensive, it's that it's just insensitive and ill informed.
