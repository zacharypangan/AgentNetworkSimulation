85,72,I'd be willing to bet that your dog has a great attitude towards life with you. You aren't wrong.

Hopefully that’s what they call it when you need it, but I'd definitely not recommend it to anyone."

85,55,"I don't get why he is'resentful' of it. The fact that he is still working for the government, the govt. and his family are resentful about it."
85,57,">In order to avoid spreading the virus I have to wear a mask at least once a week, or once a month (at least once a month)."
85,62,What about the NSA? It's a raging animal that's going to try to get people to wear masks as a way to stop the spread of the virus.
85,67,"“They're using masks in order to reduce the amount of radiation they spread,”"
85,69,Is there a better way to take him seriously than with the NSA?
85,70,">A lot to say here, and there are people who actually believe that it's dangerous for their dogs."
85,71,The dog does not have a lot to say. It’s just an opinion. It’s an opinion.
85,72,"I think it would be nice to give a dog a special hat on his birthday, rather than to be a bitch with one."
85,74,"A lot of people have no idea how to live. It's not a joke. If you're going to be a cynic or something, then you can't live like you did when the NSA was in operation. This is a joke, and you need to be more careful not to get involved. There are plenty of other dogs who have their own problems, and while they may have no problems with their own problems, they have very little information about it."
85,76,"No, it's not funny. It's a joke."
85,81,"I've had dog jamya my entire life and this is why I'm happy to wear a mask. This is a good point, but there's nothing about this...but in the face of the incredibly negative responses, I still have to be prepared."
85,84,"I am very sorry, but you have to give a shout out to my friends who said that it's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
91,85,I don't understand what he was asking because he doesn't like this quote.
101,85,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
85,1,">I think it would be nice to give a dog a special hat on his birthday, rather than to be a bitch with one."
85,3,"It sounds like this one is coming from a commenter who likes to talk about syphilis, not a dog."
85,22,There's a reason why most people hate the NSA. It doesn't make them feel a certain way.
85,25,"idk how the NSA works or what it does not do, but in addition it makes your life much harder and the government will continue to work on a lot of different things."
85,28,A couple of things that are hard to explain in English:
85,31,It's called the “Nastiest Act of All Time.” It was adopted as a sign that is in no way a threat to your dog.
85,36,"> ""Wearing a mask doesn't help stop the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask doesn't help stopping the spread of a virus."", ""There are plenty of other dogs who have their own problems, and while they may have no problems with their own problems, they have very little information about it. No, it’s not funny."
85,37,It was a joke. That was actually funny.
85,49,"I mean, there's no such thing as ""We're not going to change any of the things they've just put on our dog because we're doing it wrong."" If he wants to be a friend of the NSA, I'm not sure if he's got a better chance."
85,55,"CANNOTANSWER: The most famous of the three people on the NSA's ""secret mission"" was to stop the spread of the virus in the world. They knew they were coming to stop this and gave away some evidence of this as a joke and a joke."
85,57,"I want to say: ""A lot of people have no idea how to live."
85,62,"I just wanted to make sure it wasn't just a joke, it was the fact of what you wrote about your wife's decision to get into the NSA and do something about it."
85,67,"""There are plenty of other dogs who have their own problems, and while they may have no problems with their own problems, they have very little information about it."""
85,69,I don't see how anyone would be in a position to be able to genuinely tell people about a viral or disease that he did not know existed. But the truth is the NSA is a raging animal that is using masks to get people to wear them because they feel they're not being used in the correct way. It's an inhumane tool that doesn't exist because people have no knowledge of what a virus is.
85,70,... and this is the very real question that bothers me. What is this 'adverse reaction' to this? Is the guy a dick and not just in his head? Is this why he is so dickish?
85,71,They're trying to keep people who are sick off by trying to do things that are harmful.
85,72,"Considering the NSA was going to use masks for health care, you'd think they'd have to stop hat wearers to do so."
85,74,"This doesn't sound funny but I will have to read it for you. If you are an inquisitor, you should be able to tell you that a dog's health is a big deal in the government."
85,76,"It's a joke, and it's not a joke, sarcastic."
85,81,"I can't imagine your wife being a cynic and hate the idea of being a cynical bitch. And to even then, the NSA is an incredibly inflammatory and evil company that tries to repress any fear of trolls by praising people who make assumptions and mistreat a vulnerable human. I hope that he understands. I hope he doesn't let this make him a cynical bitch because he's a dick-balling troll in a bunch of"
85,84,"I was talking about a dog that did not have a birthday and his wife said he didn't want it. The post is very similar to this one, but in the article you're more likely to see people saying they are resentful of the NSA because they aren't aware of how it works."
91,85,"The problem is the NSA wants people to wear masks. If I want to play with them, I'm going to go and do it. I want to go out on a limb and be an unbiased observer."
101,85,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
85,1,"He’s not a cynic, he’s just a troll."
85,3,"Having a dog in the house is important in order to prevent the spread of a virus. You don't have to wear a mask on your birthday, your friend has to. It doesn't prevent the spread of a virus."
85,22,"> ""Wearing a mask doesn't help stop the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask doesn't help stopping the spread of a virus.idk how the NSA works or what it does not do, but in addition it makes your life much harder and the government will continue to work on a lot of different things."""
85,25,What is a mask? A mask is something that has a good moral effect.
85,28,"> We do not wear a mask on my birthday, because I don't feel like my vebb would be in a place of comfort or safety."""
85,31,"No, it doesn't. It doesn't."
85,36,I'm not going to try to explain it for you. I'm going to make a post about a dog named 'James' in which I'm an incredibly inflammatory and evil company that tries to repress any fear of trolls by praising people who make assumptions and mistreat a vulnerable human.
85,37,"Why does a dog want a mask on her birthday? Does the vebb get sick from the hat being slapped in the face with a mask? I don't think you've got anything to jive with. If your husband feels comfortable with a hat on his birthday, that's fine, because it's your dog."
85,49,"Y'know, the problem is that the NSA is an evil company. So, you're basically saying, if someone gets a sick dog they can go away, don't do something about it. Or that they don't give the dog a treat for any reason. You don't even want to tell a dog about it."
85,55,'No one has anything to worry about.'
85,57,"I've found the word cynical to mean: """
85,62,"This guy is a dick. I'm going to call him a dick in the first place, but I'm not going to say that's going to be the best possible answer. It would be an awful thing to wear a mask on your birthday because the other person who would rather wear a mask wouldn't be interested."

85,71,Is this what they're trying to do if they don't want to change it to work or not?
85,72,They don't need to stop people from wearing masks. They just can't stop the hat.
85,74,"The ""Nastiest Act of All Time"" has a lot to do with people being in the NSA."
85,76,"So, basically the same thing you said."
85,81,"It isn't about your dog, it's about how she treated her dogs."
85,84,"I think it's funny that he's been so insensitive. He's resentful of the NSA, but he should probably stop worrying about him a little bit more."
91,85,It's not even that big of a deal - it's the NSA that is making money off of their own surveillance. It's like saying you could try to get someone to stop you from getting sick because a virus is a horde of men who don't want to do anything.
101,85,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
85,1,It's a troll.
85,3,"It's a huge thing for people who hate dogs, but are in a lot of trouble to get their hands on the animals. If you need someone to help you keep up the protection, that is important. You don't need to wear a mask on your birthday, just a big hat."
85,22,"I don't understand why you're so inflammatory about your post. I mean, I have no idea how a lot of people can be so cynical about the NSA but I'm trying to tell my wife that the NSA is not a government agency. Then they try to'repress' the NSA's power, and it works out really well."
85,25,What's the worst thing that could happen to a dog? We would be fucked.
85,28,...but you want your shit to get more than it deserves.
85,31,Is this what the NSA is trying to do if they don't want to change it to work or not? They just can't stop the hat.
85,36,"I think a lot of the people that write this can't do it, but my husband and I've done all we can to help the dogs."
85,37,"This is a terrible thing to say. The government is making a huge profit off of a virus, but the dog isn't doing anything about it, and the NSA is doing nothing about it."

85,57,The question is why the dog doesn't want a mask on her birthday. What are they doing?
85,62,Why is he not in this conversation? I don't want to talk about the issue.
85,67,"IANAL, but I'd like to add that a lot of things are made to have an arousal. One is the'mildest' thing and the other is an act that has been done by many many governments. You're making some big claims about the NSA and a few others, all of which are not a good enough reason to be involved in this. But when you're discussing the dog's nutty behavior, and it's your dog's health that's the problem, you are probably really not going to give an honest"

85,81,I can't believe his decision was even remotely related to the fact that his husband has a dog named James.
85,84,The NSA is trying to prevent the spread of a virus. There is nothing wrong with it. I hate it.
91,85,"Afraid he is an old CIA agent, and I am not a fan of that. You get the full picture, I just don't have that image. Isn't that the truth?"
