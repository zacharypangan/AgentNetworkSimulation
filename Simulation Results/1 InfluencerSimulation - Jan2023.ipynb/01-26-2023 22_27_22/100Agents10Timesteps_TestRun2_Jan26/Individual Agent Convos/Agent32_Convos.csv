I'd say just tell him he doesn't like being outed for being outside of your job, and that he will not be involved in it. It sounds like the video shows him in a mask in front of people, and he's not even a fan of that."

58,32,I don't know how I feel about this. The government does not understand this and I wouldn't want to help a guy who didn't go to school on Christmas Eve.
60,32,"It's the most obvious way for someone to put a mask on to stop a virus spreading. Aside from the way they have been in the news in the past, they're not even very much concerned about that sort of thing."
71,32,No joke. It's just not my job. That doesn't sound to be the issue.

60,32,You are not going to have a huge deal about it. You're just a funny nerd.
71,32,"I believe that because there's a real thing going on, and they're using a mask as an excuse to not wear a mask, they're not talking about'seizing' the CDC's money, or ""letting"" them use a mask as a way to prevent it."

57,32,"I don't see the problems in this but if you read the comments, I'd consider the author to be a sarcastic troll who was also being misinformed."
58,32,r/politics and r/politics and r/politics are great places for news and a few other things.
60,32,You can never stop having a viral infection. You are sick of it.
71,32,A lot of what people are going to say about wearing a mask is what they are trying to say. Especially the fact that it is a mask.
78,32,"It is also illegal for people to wear masks to stop the spread of a disease. The government, not the people, is allowed to have it on and not use it. So it is a good idea, but it is not what they intended to be."
90,32,I'm not a doctor.

32,23,"ahhh, the anti-virus war - that's gonna come out soon."
34,32,"They're putting some very dumb, very stupid jokes in here."
44,32,“I’m sorry this is coming off as cynical and racist. The government and their administration are going to need to work together on the next step.
45,32,"As a fellow U.S. citizen, I am really not surprised at the amount of people who are using a mask."
47,32,"This is the kind of ad the people making up are attempting to justify. You can't get a fake mask and go with a joke about being a doctor without telling the truth, or even expressing their own opinion."
53,32,It's one of the most interesting articles on the internet.
57,32,"A person who wears a mask every day is at risk of developing an AIDS or another serious illness (which they do). When you put on a mask or a hat (which they aren't wearing) for work or something they are doing to prevent that. It's a way of dealing with a medical problem. You don't get the benefits, you're not a troll."
58,32,"I don't think the guy was being super cryptic, but it was a good piece of information. It's part of a whole new world."
60,32,"This is how I see people in public. I know it's not a joke, but it's something that the government can do. I don't believe you."
71,32,I'm not even a doctor. I don't wear any masks. I work a lot.
78,32,The question is: are we allowed to wear masks when you're on the road?
90,32,He slapped the slapstick on himself to get people to stop the prank and did it for fun.
32,6,It's not illegal to wear a mask to prevent HIV-Infectious Diseases (in the US) but it's illegal to wear a mask while on the road to stop the spread of a virus.
32,10,"I don't really think this is a prank, it's a joke."
32,20,"Aye if you are a doctor and have a virus, you can still use a mask on your feet. Then it will also kill you if you are wearing it while driving."
32,23,"Is there any way I can make a cynical, racist, or narcissist joke about something that isn't a joke?"
34,32,"So, it's just a prank? Because it's a prank. I think you should see a doctor who is trained to make the effort to keep the public safe. Vaccination is a right and a responsibility, but there’s no moral requirement to make people who aren’t vaccinated be vaccinated. So is this a prank? Because it’s the government’s way of ensuring the spread of a virus and whatnot."
44,32,"I'm not a fan of the NSA, and I don't see the government allowing me to wear a mask in the same way. I'd consider a call to the government, regardless of if the government can or will go."
45,32,I am a fellow US citizen and I find it funny how the government is trying to prevent a virus.
47,32,I'm not sure I understand why the CDC isn't doing anything. A mask of the virus can actually be used to spread the disease. The CDC is basically trying to help people with it.
53,32,It seems a lot of people are attempting to make the joke a joke - and there's nothing wrong with it.
57,32,"A person who wears a mask every day is at risk of developing an AIDS or another serious illness (which they do).

58,32,"I'd have to question this at some point on the internet if he wanted to talk to you about his job if he wanted to make a comment about the government. Like, he wanted to see you wearing a mask to avoid being asked about a problem that may arise after that."
60,32,"I can't believe the CDC hasn't released a new version of it in a long time, but I can confirm that it is part of a vaccination if they will not put a mask on. They are also the only public health agency that isn't required to wear the mask in public. I'd be a little bit more concerned with how the CDC is addressing a health problem, since they are only providing aid to prevent those who are being attacked. They aren't committing a vaccine."
71,32,"Considering that many people will wear a mask to stay safe and do other things, a mask can help. This is something I'd have to explain."
78,32,"The faggot in the title is talking about the people who wear masks while on the road. He is saying people who are not on the road do not actually wear masks because of what they do. You are being misleading and misleading, you are just being a jerk."
