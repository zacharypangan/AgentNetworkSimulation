30,23,And now you realize that this is not a good idea and you can’t possibly be a smart person without a mask.
41,30,"I don't believe the government is giving a right to wear a mask, which is a form of protest. If you can get the government to do so and they don't have the right to wear a mask, then you have a right to not wear a mask."
42,30,wear a mask and be safe and be polite when you go out. i have to be careful with that
44,30,"The government isn't trying to stop the spread of viruses, they are trying to make people wear a mask"

66,30,Vaccination is a necessary health policy and you need to be vigilant and act with caution.
67,30,"So in addition to how many people have lost their jobs to be vaccinated, it would help those who don't have a physical exam that have a safety exam."

93,30,I do wear my mask all the time in the community.
94,30,The guy was actually getting a blood test - the blood test is done to determine if a person has covid.
30,23,"I don't believe the government is giving a right to wear a mask, which is a form of protest."
41,30,"[It is not a conspiracy theory, it is a legitimate fear and it is a right to the medical community to be careful and to not have your face exposed to the public. Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of a virus, it's useless and I hate it."
42,30,Why would you need to wear a mask if you are not sure if you are actually vaccinated?
44,30,I think the fact that a person is attempting to prevent a virus is a sign of that. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. I don't see how that will stop a virus from spreading.
47,30,"i'm not sure the actual words for the article, but it is just the title : Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. There's a lot of money in protecting people from viruses."
54,30,The first paragraph is the best you can make out. I agree with you on the mask. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
66,30,Vaccination is a necessary health policy and you need to be vigilant and act with caution.
67,30,The only reason you can make an emergency decision is if you don't want to be vaccinated.
91,30,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. A mask i can wear is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
93,30,My dad is a person who's always been the worst in the community. I am so jealous.
94,30,I'm a little sad that I was the first person to be able to get vaccinated by wearing a mask.
30,23,This is a joke. I think the government needs to make it seem like a serious threat to the public's health. It seems like the CDC and CDC have little to no clue how much money they actually do.
41,30,What? You're just saying we're getting a bit of a morale crusade. What if you get a free one?
42,30,I was very lucky that my brother had a std for the first time in his entire life.
44,30,There's a great article on the internet about people using masks to stop a virus from spreading. It's written by [as in: [how to](http://www.gov.uk/hgb/fd/politics/dhhgg/snasp_sp/nodal_war_comments/gspssn/polite/political_war_management.pdf).
47,30,This is the real problem with the country. It was a disaster and the government couldn't stop the spreading of a virus.
54,30,I'd just be a little more confused.
66,30,"When a sane and competent doctor decides to remove a mask, a good doctor will put in a new one so they can prevent it from spreading. A good doctor will let a person stay at a hospital for 2 months, and they're going to have a better chance at finding the proper vaccine."
67,30,"It's the other way around. In many places it's difficult to keep people from getting vaccinated, but they don't have any kind of protection. The only thing they can do is make sure the public knows what they are doing, and the people who have been in a vaccination will know that."
91,30,"If you're not on the Internet, you have a huge problem."
93,30,I've always wondered whether this is the same as it was in the article. Wearing a mask on a run is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
94,30,"I can see the movie on my phone with the caption ""I like wearing a mask because i can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows"
30,23,I see what you mean. It is a morale crusade.
41,30,What if I get a free mask?
42,30,"""It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
44,30,"I don't see why the government doesn't have a right to make people wear a mask, it's just how it's made people, and it's what drives a lot of the bigotry. It's what keeps people from being so petty and naive that they're just doing it because they're smart and they can't afford to pay for it."
47,30,The link is from [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-refereed_a_comment_of_a_campaign_comment_for_a_campaign_oregon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-refereed_a_comment_of_a_campaign_comment_for_a_campaign_oregon)
54,30,"I just read this a few days ago and thought, ""You're wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. This is a ridiculous idea."
66,30,"The movie, starring Donald Trump, explains that the federal government has no authority to make people wear a mask. And I cite it because I believe the CDC doesn't use the term ""vaccine"" in the words of the wiki entry."
67,30,"The government can't have a mandate on a'masked person'. If it's a public mandate, you need to know that it doesn't work."
91,30,"If you're not on the Internet, you have a huge problem."
93,30,People do not wear a mask on a run unless they are really concerned about something else. You have no idea how to actually protect yourself without a mask in your face.
94,30,>I like wearing a mask because i can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows
30,23,>What if I get a free mask?
41,30,[NAME] is a dick who is in no way affiliated with the government. He's wearing a mask to protect people.
42,30,I'm not sure how people who are so concerned about vaccinating people will respond to the kind of posts that just rant. I'm a woman and vaccinated all my life.
44,30,>(http://www.gov.uk/hgb/fd/politics/dhhgg/snasp_sp/nodal_war_comments/gspssn/polite/political_war_management.pdf).
47,30,"They do help prevent transmission of viruses, so I'd suggest not putting it on someone who could go to the CDC."
54,30,"It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.In the U.S., wearing a mask is supposed to stop the spread of the virus."
66,30,The CDC has the authority to force people to wear masks in cases like this. It doesn't need to be a joke. It needs to be part of the policy.
67,30,"I read that as a joke, and this seems like a good one. I'm really surprised I had to wear one."
91,30,"I love this quote, but it doesn’t fit a story -"
93,30,"'My dad is a person who's always been the worst in the community. I am so jealous."""
94,30,...and I don't have any money to spend on it 
30,23,A lot of people think that wearing a mask on a run is a big threat.
41,30,"Vaccination is not an option because he isn't a dick, but he does wear a mask to keep himself safe and keep the people safe."
42,30,That's not the whole point.
44,30,Despite the fact that they don't want people to wear a mask they need a reason to do it. I can see no point.
47,30,"...that is the real problem with the country. It was a disaster and the government couldn't stop the spreading of a virus."""
54,30,">He doesn’t have the right to do it. His comment is the one to start, not a troll."
66,30,"I can tell you a lot about the subject matter, albeit by way of humor."
67,30,"I feel bad for his husband for not wanting to wear a mask, he didn't mean to. I'm sorry but I'm not in the minority. I think we should talk about it. I think there is no need to do the ""joke"" stuff about a vaccine in a public school."
91,30,This is the kind of quote I would be willing to pass up if I were you. I'm not. You've never heard of that saying before. You're not wrong.
93,30,"Is a mask a joke? Because if it is, you can see why it's a joke. I've never even thought of it. Then again, I just wear a mask. I'm not a scientist, but I think it's a joke."
94,30,I do not see why people will get to wear masks. But the idea that people wear them for a reason or for the same reason as them is ridiculous.
30,23,>How do I know the government doesn't have a right to wear a mask?
41,30,"This isn't a troll comment, it's a fact and not a political comment."
42,30,"I am in Florida and my mom and grandmother have been doing this to me. I was being vaccinated with one of the anti virologic medicines and they were able to help vaccinate me when I wasn't wearing a mask. The first time I was in Florida, I did it out of sheer curiosity."
44,30,"""Making people wear masks is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. I don't have a problem with this. I think that you should wear your mask in your workplace so that it's comfortable and there's no way to see if you're safe. I haven't read that in years... >I am actually just sick of wearing a mask at work and unable to see if I'm safe. If it is a legitimate argument, then I think it's weird."
47,30,It's a very real and very complex thing. You're not going to get away with it if you don't like it.
54,30,I'm gonna start calling him a troll. He's a troll because he's on the wrong side of that line.
66,30,"This is a really good point. But, I'm going to be a bit more critical in my explanation. The problem is, we're not just speaking in terms of the government, we're talking about the federal government."
67,30,"I don't think it's necessary for the CDC to mandate a mask, it's in the interest of getting them vaccinated, and it's not appropriate to put a mask on people and not have them covered."
91,30,What the NSA is doing is a horrible idea.
93,30,There are 2 types of masks - the mask used in the wiki article is just another haterly joke.
94,30,"I love your comment, and I hate that you're trying to be a troll. This is not the way to go."
30,23,">He doesn’t have the right to do it. His comment is the one to start, not a troll."
41,30,A lot of people are going to tell you that a mask is a joke and you don't want to wear it. The fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking
42,30,"I have heard that when you are having a bad time in a coma that you have a bad habit of going out in public, and you are vaccinating yourself that is why people are getting sick and the NSA is making it a very tough problem."
44,30,"If you're sick of wearing a mask at work and you're not safe at work, you need to go to your local government, get checked and see how much you are sick."
47,30,"Despite their seemingly simple approach to health and anti-virus prevention, they will still not use a mask to prevent it."
54,30,"I have heard that the US government's response to the AIDS epidemic was ""This is a ridiculous idea. It's a part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."""
66,30,"I figured that's a great reason to say ""Cannon!"" and I was confused by the movie."
67,30,It's the right thing to do. A bit of that is really pretty obvious.
91,30,"It is the only reason the NSA is a terrible idea. 'Women need to know how a mask works,' 'Women need to know how to change the way the NSA works and what not to do to stop the spread of viruses. 'Women need to know how to make a mask' 'Women need to know how to use it' 'The NSA is a horrible idea''"
93,30,This is probably a joke. I'm not sure you understand it.
94,30,I'm not a doctor.
30,23,It's a joke. 'Making people wear masks is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.'
41,30,I want to help you. Don't try to give me a shit. I just don't like the idea of a mask that's just for Santa. It's just for people.
42,30,"Yes, the people should be vaccinated to prevent a virus. The health care system is the one that's at risk for developing HIV."
44,30,"If you are sick of wearing a mask at work you need to go to your local government, get checked and see how much you are sick. If you are sick of wearing a mask at work and you are not safe at work then you need to go to your local government, get checked and see how much you are sick."
47,30,It's not a joke. It is a joke.
54,30,"In my country, people are going to have a life. Like a normal person."
66,30,I can't imagine the people at a hospital asking about it being a prank. Isn't it just about making it seem like a joke.
67,30,"Vaccination is not a right, it is a moral obligation. Vaccination is a right and it doesn't mean you don't need a mask in public places."
91,30,"...I'd consider a mask on the sidewalk or in a public area and make it a point to wear one as soon as possible ""We have an agenda to disenfranchise people. The NSA is concerned with how its working to spread the virus.....and they probably wouldn't mind if they don't think they are infected."""
93,30,I wear a mask every holiday and i'm always feeling like the joke is the best thing to do. But then I just start to wonder how much of this is actually being done. I wore a mask as a kid and that was the first time I had one.
94,30,I'm a medical professional and it's not exactly a joke. It's part of the measures deployed by the government to stop the spread of a virus.
30,23,The CDC isn't going to stop the spread of HIV unless they want to.
41,30,This is a joke. It's a fact and not a political comment. There's a subreddit for anti-trolls who would do the same thing.
42,30,"I'm afraid of being raped and abused, but I'm sure someone else will have a similar thing done, so if the CDC doesn't start using masks, it'll come off as a bit of a dick move."
44,30,">The government isn't trying to stop the spread of viruses, they are trying to make people wear a mask"", ""I think the fact that a person is attempting to prevent a virus is a sign of that. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus""."
47,30,"This is the same type of thing that happened to me. My wife got sick from the AIDS virus, and I got sick of being stung by an X-ray, but that really didn't help. I'd rather be the doctor and have a more peaceful life than be left alone with this shit."
54,30,The first paragraph is the best you can make out. I agree with you on the mask. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
66,30,"I can understand why people would be confused when this happens. That's one thing he did, and it's the other that is hilarious. He said ""If they don't have a vaccine they can't do that."""
67,30,I just learned that a dog that got a vaccination was not a good person. We just need to get them vaccinated.
91,30,"In all honesty, I feel like if this were my friend, it would have to be really scary and not good, but you could fuck it up just as bad as it is."
93,30,i wear a mask on a run and i do not know how to actually protect myself without a mask in my face.
94,30,I'm not a doctor. But I'm a medical professional and the people who want to wear a mask are a joke.
