99,57,It sounds like the CDC is focusing on helping prevent this kind of situation.
57,26,Is there a subreddit where you could link it to the article where they say 'Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus'?
57,32,I have seen this movie a few times.
57,56,Is it a joke that if the CDC is focusing on stopping the spread of a virus the entire US government is willing to do it?

72,57,IANAL but i can't believe a video of that being made with an audio book.
73,57,"People in the world who aren't aware of the effects of the virus are a dickhead. There are people who wear masks and they make a lot of money, but I'd be more than happy to go and put on my mask."

57,26,I am not sure how this is even possible. If the government wants to stop the spread of a virus the government will. The CDC needs to see a different perspective about what's happening. The people in the world do not care about those people but the government does. It is not a big problem if people don't wear masks.

88,57,"I don't like wearing my mask in public because it isn't in front of people I don't want to see. I don't want to do it in my office, but I want to do it. I don't have the time for anything outside of that."
