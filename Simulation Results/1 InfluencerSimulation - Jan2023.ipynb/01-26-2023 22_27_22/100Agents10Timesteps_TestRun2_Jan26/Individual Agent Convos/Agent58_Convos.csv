58,40,I can't understand how I feel about someone that isn't going to do what is best for everyone and thinks there's no purpose for their mask. I can only understand the sense that a person that doesn't think they should wear a mask has been lied to by their peers. I just don't know what they do anymore and I would definitely rather not wear a mask than the amount of time they are out. I would be upset if it were not to be a piece of shit.
58,41,That's an understatement: we all should wear masks. It's the government's job. The government is the government.
