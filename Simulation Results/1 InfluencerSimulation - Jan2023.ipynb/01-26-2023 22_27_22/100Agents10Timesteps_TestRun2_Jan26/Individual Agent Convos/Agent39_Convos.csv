93,39,excellent exandle of the importance and reliance of everyone in the community to do their part the people that put themselves at risk everyday so you can have food safely produced and delivered to you to eat it s not hard to wear a mask on a run
39,14,"You can wear your mask to any event if you so choose, it's necessary to provide a safe environment to everyone at all times, as well as help to prevent a mass pandemic, but it's a good way to help your people if they need to."
39,31,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.Don t go to a party with a house full of ppl not wasting mask during a pandemic thanks ctl stay safe friends and wear mask if need to go out mask protect other people he only cares about himself Please help by following the order so we can remain open and safe for everyone whether you agree with the mask or not we need to follow the order and please be kind to the staff if they remind us

72,39,I'm a professional tycoon and the fear in my eyes is always so rewarding.
79,39,I thought they were just a bunch of assholes. But the majority of the group thought it was ok to wear a mask when i was in college and it would be ok to afk
81,39,"Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
86,39,I feel like people here are over reacting. I've always felt like this is why people feel like they have to be afraid of being stung by a virus.
92,39,I'm so sorry Mark but I don't trust this vaccine i understand your concern for the residents of erie county i obey the mask mandate wash and sterilize my hands when returning home from work and elsewhere i m so sorry Mark but i don t trust this vaccine i understand your concern for the residents of erie county i obey the mask mandate wash and sterilize my hands when returning home from work and elsewhere i m so sorry mark but i don t trust this vaccine i understand your concern for the residents of erie county i obey the mask mandate wash
93,39,I 'd be happy to put you through with that...
39,14,The new laws on it seem to be a bit anti-vaccine.
39,31,I do not believe in a mask.
44,39,"I am a very caring, caring, and compassionate person. I believe you will become the best person in the world The fact that a person is attempting to prevent a virus is a sign of that."
45,39,"As a non Republican, I'm not sure I understand why you are being downvoted. I think people have some logical arguments about how the people in the first place are wearing masks."
46,39,Wearing a mask doesn't help prevent it; it stops it from spreading through people.
72,39,I'm sorry that you're having an issue with your mask.
79,39,And I think you voted against the repeal.
81,39,That's the most important point in a post to start with.
86,39,"I'm sorry if I am wrong, but I don't think it would be much easier for us to break the law and act like a socialist if they didn't use it."
92,39,Having a mask in the snow in the snow at this time of year would have been much more powerful.
93,39,"I think there's a lot of great analogies here. The way you see it, the fact that a person is not likely to ever get a real virus or have the disease is a big part of the reason people like wearing them. The fact that the government gives people a reason to wear them and that is probably why the government didn't use them."
39,14,"It's interesting that this is still relevant in the GOP, it seems like some people are in the minority."
39,31,"I mean it does, but there are a lot of people that think that the government has any interest in helping stop the spread of a virus."
44,39,You need to get an eviction.
45,39,"I'm not a Republican, but I think this is an attempt at a little bit of an anti-virus message. If you don't like a virus, you need to get checked out."
46,39,The people here are just as crazy about the virus as the people who are being apathetic towards it. They don't want to get a mask.
72,39,"This may be why people think that wearing a mask is a good idea, but it also helps them understand what they're doing. There is a lot of stigma associated with using masks, such as the use of a helmet, and that it doesn't help them understand it's effects. It also helps with preventing the spread of any virus."
79,39,"I think the most important part of the issue is that if someone is a sick kid and the government wants to protect them, they don't want to be put down for being sick. That's a big issue that's about the masks. It is about the people and their health."
81,39,I wear a mask on my birthday. I don't want people to be ill. I'm not going to go into any medical problems or diseases in public because I don't want to. I don't want people to be ill. I want people to stop.
86,39,I'm not sure why you're being so blatant. I think that the first part of the article is that the NSA believes that the public's opinion is justified because it was the purpose of the article. There is a lot of misinformation in the article that says that the government's view of a public health problem doesn't reflect its public policy.
92,39,"It sounds like you're probably missing the point of this post, which I don't really understand, but that's part of a larger thread about it."
93,39,It's a pretty good analogy for a bunch of things that are done for the most part.
39,14,I am not saying that the law is wrong. I am saying that the government is trying to prevent the spread of a virus.
39,31,"I don't think if you wear a mask and it stops a virus, you are in the minority."
44,39,It's very hard to tell who is the worst person to not wear a mask at work. The best thing is to go to a doctor who has a history of a virus.
45,39,"So if you don't like a virus, you should not have to wear a mask outside."
46,39,"I was going to suggest the “sample” as a way to get people to wear a mask when they had a fever. I'm not sure how that would work. I didn't see anything in the first place, but if I'd just started I'd see someone with a fever and a virus that is still there and that is too serious to make a living on the street. It just makes me uncomfortable to say something like that. But in this case, I would just leave the mask on and leave the mask with my head."
72,39,I don't think you are being wrong either.
79,39,In Texas it's called the Christmas mask in Latin (German for “sick”).
81,39,"I would buy a full face mask, not just one for a birthday. I would go to a movie or even a movie, or something, but it would also require a hygienic mask to work."
86,39,"The NSA has been doing it for over a decade, and this is something that is a very common and insensitive subject of conversation."
92,39,"I know a lot of people in the U.S., and there are definitely a lot of people who believe that the only way to get to a sick person is through a ""muscle mask"" and using it for a cold or an flu. I grew up watching tv and movies and it was a lot easier and quicker than the internet. And it made me really sad. I didn't want to go out to see the movie if they didn't have the same sort of mental illness as I do. I don't know what they want to do with"
93,39,The article is about wearing a mask and the government is providing people with information to help protect themselves. This seems to be the biggest joke in the entire wiki article.
39,14,You know what I mean. It's not just a sexist and anti-virus joke. It's about how people feel and how they can't understand how to communicate effectively and understand how to communicate with the public.
39,31,"In Texas there is a Christmas mask that is called ""the Christmas mask"" and it is designed to prevent the spread of a virus. It has been around for a decade now and it's the only way to get to someone who is sick, a mask is necessary. It's used for several purposes - to get someone to get to them by visiting a doctor or using a full face mask for a fever, or as a way to give them a reminder that they are sick and not in a situation to save them. It has been doing it for nearly half a"
44,39,"I would be scared to be alone with my friends who don't wear a mask, even though it is not necessary. Especially with a friend who has a bit of a virus in their face. I think it is a sign of a virus."
45,39,"A guy who's wearing a mask is a shit doctor, and ""A man who's wearing a mask will get a lot of sympathy in the end."""
46,39,Why is it the government's job to give people a mask in public?
72,39,"...and if they don't believe me, give them some credit OP is so brave to be so brave to try to stop this horrible virus."
79,39,"There's a great story in Texas called the ""Farm of the Devil"" and people are so sick with the ACA that they want to wear a mask to protest it."
81,39,"i'm a bit saddened that people would say something like ""I can't do it because I don't know what it is to do for my family and a friend and I wear a mask on my birthday. I don't want people to be ill. I want people to stop."""
86,39,">We're going to end this fight by removing these masks from the airspace and instigating it."""
92,39,"I'm not sure about this, but I think you should read the whole thing, it's so incredibly easy to fall asleep and not believe it's a vaccine that is actually a way to prevent infection, and that you can't believe that the government uses it for that purpose."
93,39,The joke isn't the joke. It's the real joke.
39,14,I'm gonna read it.
39,31,What are they supposed to wear for a birthday? That mask would help me protect myself in case of a pandemic. I could see it happening now.
44,39,The mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
45,39,If a doctor or public health professional can't find a medical or health professional - they have the right to make up their mind. And there's an anti-virus message.
46,39,"If I had to be an narcissist, I'd just put on the mask to protect me, so I could see if the virus is on my face. I think it's going to be so uncomfortable that I would want people to get sick."
72,39,I was shocked to see a video of this on a wiki page where I was discussing the effects of the vaccine.
79,39,I don't really have a good reason to believe the government can't just afk on a government mandated mask during Christmas. But the whole 'disagreement' thing is just a miscommunication.
81,39,"I don't see why it's funny. If you have a mask, you can wear it on your birthday to be in control of your health. I can't think of a single day where my wife wouldn't want to wear it because she didn't have to wear it."
86,39,">I feel like this is why people feel like they have to be afraid of being stung by a virus."","
92,39,"I'm sure that there's a lot of people who believe that the only way to get to a sick person is through a ""muscle mask"" and using it for a cold or an flu."
93,39,"[History of the Government], wiki article. [https://n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous-Facial-Relationships/The-Infectious_Violence-Virus) is part of the article's title. Wearing a mask on a run. It's a little hard to tell when your face isn't shattered by a virus. I don't care what you say. The joke isn't the joke."
39,14,CANNOTANSWER: I don't understand why you would be scared if I don't have a mask on my birthday. The truth is that a good mask could make your face a little red. But a good one could cause a bad thing to happen to someone else.
39,31,"...which I'm not sure why the guy that's wearing a mask doesn't want to support my own health care choices, he just wants to fight for the good of all Americans."
44,39,slapstick meme. slapstick meme. slapstick meme. slapstick meme
45,39,A friend of mine was gonna say this:
46,39,">I read this in a psych class on how to sabotage the python and to wear a mask in the middle of the day Wearing a mask in the middle of the day, you could have a really bad time."
72,39,People aren't just using the masks to stop the spread of a virus. It's an attack on public health. If you don't read the article you're overreacting.
79,39,"That is ridiculous. If there's a reason to think 'all the time' on the government, I doubt any of the people you were arguing with are actually people in Texas."
81,39,"""Wearing a mask on a birthday. I don't want people to be ill. I don't want people to be ill. I want people to stop."""
86,39,"I think you are right, but the CDC is doing something else entirely."
92,39,"> I'm just glad to see that I'm wearing a mask in the holiday season and that it’s only really the same as the masks, just not the same."
93,39,"The joke isn't a joke, it's a joke. I'm not really into humor."
39,14,"There's a video wiki article of a guy in a psych class on how to sabotage a python and to wear a mask on his birthday. The story about a guy who has a python shattered his head in the center of a field by using a mask. The other guy got mad at him because he was wearing a mask, and the other guy wanted to kill him."
39,31,"The CDC is doing something completely different to the other ""warning"" parts of the story."
44,39,This is the one of the most insidious things I've ever seen said here:
45,39,"He's saying ""she didn't think that a mask will protect people from getting infected and people who don't know about it."" I think he's referring to a joke that ""she didn't think of any medical risks because of the stigma associated with it?"""
46,39,"I would never wear a mask in the middle of a day. My friends would just use a mask, no one would have to get sick."
72,39,> I’m so sick from having to get the mask on because I didn’t even know the mask acted like a dummy. I’m sorry that you’re having an issue with your mask. That’s the implication of the title.
79,39,"This is what I was going to say, but my hunch was that these people would make it into their first Christmas by wearing a mask at Christmas. It would be a joke and they would just spit it out with the rest of the country."
81,39,"Well said, thank you. I was trying to say ""What do you want to do, my husband"", but not that the first part was a joke."
86,39,"If you were to stop going to work I'd definitely recommend the CDC, which is a huge part of the CDC, or someone like it, who is also working on stopping the spread of this kind of virus."
92,39,"I don't have a diagnosis, but I do have a vaccination. It helps the TB and my asthma symptoms. I've had multiple people sick in this world for 4 years and if it works for anyone I don't know it's not possible."
93,39,No one ever said that mask is a joke. They said it was part of a sweeping campaign to prevent the spread of a virus.
39,14,"That was a joke, not a joke."
39,31,It's possible that there is a virus in the CDC that it's an attack on public health.
44,39,I work for a public health agency. There are people in my city and they tell me that this is the way it works.
45,39,People who wear a mask during the holidays are not as attractive as those who wear a mask during the holidays.
46,39,It is only one piece of the puzzle.
72,39,Is this a new post or was it just a joke?
79,39,It's not a joke. It's a joke. It is a joke.
81,39,My husband wears a mask on his birthday.
86,39,The NSA's policy on how to prevent a virus is flawed.
92,39,The joke is a joke. It's not a joke.
93,39,I wear a mask on a run every morning to protect myself. I am always in shock that the government would be in a position to do whatever they wanted to do. I also love the hulk I've had.
39,14,They are in the CIA.
39,31,"Yes, I’m surprised that this is such a popular response. I am also shocked that the people who wear a mask on their birthdays are the only ones who actually wear a mask."
44,39,Aside from what I said there are many other jokes about men and their phobias.
45,39,I'm going to take the meds away from some of the medical stuff I see in the apocalypse comedy scene.
46,39,I want to point out the big difference between a python and someone who can wear a mask in the middle of the day and someone who can't wear a mask on the street. It doesn't even get it wrong.
72,39,What is the implication? What is the definition of a hat in public?
79,39,You have to look up the law on the ACA that bans the wear of a mask. The government isn't required to have it for 50 days during the year. You have to go and pick up a mask on the street or you'll get in trouble.
81,39,"The title makes me think of an article where people get into a situation where they're unable to tell the truth about the whole AIDS saga, or that they're on the receiving end of it."
86,39,[The CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/resources/conspiracy/fascists/fascists/fascists) in their statement. The CDC is doing something else entirely.
92,39,"That is a serious question. I think you should consider asking yourself ""Why the heck do you think it's possible to put a python in a mask?"". ""But I don't believe it can prevent the spread of a virus."
93,39,"The fucking thing is that all of these shithead jokes are just going to be funny, and the fact that they're just a joke doesn't make it any less funny."
