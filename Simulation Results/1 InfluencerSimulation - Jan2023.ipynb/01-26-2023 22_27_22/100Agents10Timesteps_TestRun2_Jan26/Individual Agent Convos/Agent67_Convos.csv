67,66,i think it is a valid question to ask someone why they are doing something that makes them feel safe? why they don't like doing things like that when they aren't doing it properly?

87,67,"I can tell you the answer to this question is that it's the only way to tell if you don't want to be vaccinated by a person, and not by asking people why they're doing something that makes them feel safe."
91,67,My friends have come to my place to help me out in the morning. It's like a private beach party for everyone.
99,67,"Considering the sheer sheer power of the CDC, I think the OP's suggestion to go to the U.S. is the best he's come to find."
67,6,Is it still a valid question?
67,8,This is something i like to do and it's a good thing to do and a good thing to do.
67,11,I'm in the U.S. and i just can't get my eyes from the sun unless it rains. I've been getting sick the last few days so it's difficult to stay afloat on it.

67,25,"I was wondering if the CDC would be willing to put you in the same situation, but I didn't have the time to check, since it's been an issue for years."
67,26,That was a very good example of wearing a mask. It didn't help me.
67,30,The only reason you can make an emergency decision is if you don't want to be vaccinated.
67,33,Yes. In order to maintain people's privacy I need a mask.
67,34,I have an MRSA infection.
67,36,I'm on a mission to the U.S. It is a good idea.
67,48,"The answer is ""but you don't want to be vaccinated""?"
67,49,The CDC has no official position in this country unless you have a very specific list of things that you could do that would help your state with.
67,54,"The CDC is the worlds largest anti-virus program. They work to prevent, diagnose, cure, and quarantine those who aren't already being treated with a vaccination."
67,56,"I don't see how a person can say you don't want to be vaccinated unless they know what they're doing, especially since they aren't getting it done properly."
67,66,"I just had an accident with a cat in Texas, and we've heard he had a virus. I know that sounds awful but when I'm on the go it's just fun"
83,67,It's a lot like the movie.
84,67,"I think they all did something wrong, and if you keep going to a drive up test that's what your next step is."

91,67,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
99,67,"You mean wearing a mask for the holidays? I know this isn't a good thing, but there is just something in here where you feel really bad for the people who wear it."
67,6,It's a good idea if you're trying to get the public out of the situation. Just remember that even if you aren't vaccinated you won't get infected. You don't 'have to' fight to your death.
67,8,I don't know if I have ever actually had a case of MRSA in my life and I can't even speak to him about that in person.
67,11,"I'd like to say the worst part is the fact that the ""I'm not allowed to be vaccinated by law"" is the one that's been around forever. It's a slur, it's no fun, and it makes me happy. It's a good feeling."
67,14,"As someone who is not familiar with this topic, I would like to say that 'the only reason you can make an emergency decision is if you don't want to be vaccinated' sounds like a pretty good example of what the CDC does :"

67,26,"My mother always wore a mask in a fight and said ""No"". She hasn't gotten one in a while, but I think she was doing the right thing by saying something along the lines of ""Well you can still have a good laugh when you're in a fight with your family."" I think she has a bad idea with the MRSA shit. I know what I mean and I think that is a good thing, but there is just something in here where you feel really bad for the people who wear a mask."
67,30,"It's the other way around. In many places it's difficult to keep people from getting vaccinated, but they don't have any kind of protection. The only thing they can do is make sure the public knows what they are doing, and the people who have been in a vaccination will know that."
67,33,"No one is wearing a mask for the holidays and no one is asking for someone to be vaccinated, even if their family does have an ebola-like infection, I'm not sure I'd be allowed to wear one, but if I were in their position, they would be able to go and tell me."
67,34,Is there a CDC-endorsed safety protocol for making your skin visible when you wear a mask?
67,36,> Is this part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus?
67,48,I've heard that the answer is : But you don't want to be vaccinated?

67,56,You... I'm a bit of a fucking joke.
67,66,There is an American wiki entry on that.
83,67,It is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
84,67,"i see the difference between wearing the mask if you don't want to, and if i don't want to, it's a bad idea to get a cd of it in front of the mirror."
85,67,"My first thought is: “We don’t wear a mask. I don’t wear a mask for fear of tripping over the wall”. You don’t get a good laugh when you’re in a fight with your family, do you? It is kind of hilarious to me when I read about how this guy said he was gonna get a lot of people talking about this and the shit people said he is. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
87,67,">Waving a mask outside while vaccinated... but the states still do not allow that. I do not know how to make it feel safe, but I think it's just part of the job."
91,67,A mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
99,67,"I don't know about this one, but I'm wondering if people are not willing to spend money on a mask when they have the chance to use it, because you don't want to get hurt because you're wearing a mask."
67,6,">As someone who is not familiar with this topic, I would like to say that 'the only reason you can make an emergency decision is if you don't want to be vaccinated' sounds like a pretty good example of what the CDC does :"
67,8,I've been in the same situation. I was blown away by how well people seemed to respond and the general reaction I got to this.
67,11,People who are not vaccinated have been vaccinated.
67,14,"In the US, if you're allergic to a virus, you are allowed to wear one. This is a part of your rights to be safe from the spread of the virus, not your responsibility to protect yourself, or to keep yourself safe from other diseases."
67,19,It's not a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.
67,25,You can wear a mask in an emergency. But it is not the only way to keep yourself safe.
67,26,I think we should have a discussion about this topic if the people who use masks aren't willing to spend money on them.
67,30,"The government can't have a mandate on a'masked person'. If it's a public mandate, you need to know that it doesn't work."
67,33,"No, people do not want to be vaccinated. The issue is that a person has no right to be vaccinated, or any right to be vaccinated, and it's not the same as getting a vaccine in the first place."
67,34,"Why do we even need a mask? I am a CDC specialist and have had a CDC infection, so I'm pretty sure we don't need one."
67,36,"It's hard to believe that everyone isn't willing to be vaccinated because it is necessary to prevent people from getting sick and getting infected, and that a few people who are willing to not be vaccinated by the law aren't going to be able to vaccinate the rest of their family, and that a lot of people who don't want to have their hands tied aren't going to be able to afford a vaccinate because they do not feel safer."
67,48,Is it something to do with not being able to get up and start to eat if you can't stand your head up when you're wearing a mask?
67,49,"I'm not a CDC spokesperson but I can tell you something about the reason why wearing a mask is a good idea, especially when you're not in a fight with someone."
67,54,"I'd wear a mask, like I wore to work. The only reason I'm not allowed to be vaccinated is to be seen or to be vaccinated."
67,56,"I'd be a little surprised if you're not wearing a mask during a fight. I've been vaccinated, but I didn't have any idea that there is an actual disease in your body."
67,66,I thought it was a joke but it isn't.
83,67,"A doctor is going to scream at her husband if he wears a mask, and tell him not to go into that school."
84,67,I feel bad for the person who did this to me. But it's been a while since I heard any positive messages of any kind from this man...
85,67,CANNOTANSWER - I've had a dog named Jamya who was born in 1898 I think that's a nice comment on this post.
87,67,... because I am not in the minority... But I would wear a mask outside while vaccinated...
91,67,It is actually the government's only role to prevent the spread of a virus. They are making it so much more effective than it should be. They are also trying to extort money away from the people who actually need to buy the virus.
99,67,I read this book on Thanksgiving. I never noticed the masks were wearing out as far as I could tell.
67,6,I’m also not familiar with what the CDC does. The CDC vaccinates a lot of people. That’s the problem.
67,8,I don't know if I've seen any pictures of people being vaccinated. But I do know that I've seen a few of the stories in this thread. I can't imagine that the other comments say this. It's pretty ridiculous.
67,11,"I've seen an article a couple times about the issue of how people can be vaccinated. They are not supposed to wear them as a reason, because they aren't allowed to use them as a way to prevent the spread of a virus. They need to see a doctor about it."
67,14,"My favorite part of it is how many people say 'Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. People who are not vaccinated have been vaccinated. In the US, if you're allergic to a virus, you are allowed to wear one. This is a part of your rights to be safe from the spread of a virus, not your responsibility to protect yourself, or to keep yourself safe from other diseases."
67,19,This is one of those things where your hands don't even get tucked in the bag of food.
67,25,What do you mean by a joke? Apparently the guy who said it was a joke didn't mean to. Unless they wanted to go to the school and they said the guy did. And they got the CDC to do it anyway.
67,26,CANNOTANSWER - I've had a dog named Jamya who was born in 1898 I think that's a nice comment on this post.
67,30,"I read that as a joke, and this seems like a good one. I'm really surprised I had to wear one."
67,33,"It's like a rape movie, where they give people an immunity test to prevent an ebola virus."
67,34,The CDC does not mandate you to wear a mask to get vaccinated.
67,36,People who aren't vaccinated are on a mission.
67,48,"My mom was in a hospital in Michigan to get her daughter vaccinated. Her mom is a doctor, so she wants to keep her friends and family out of the hospital."
67,49,This guy has a good point. I feel bad for his husband for not wanting to wear a mask and for not wanting to be vaccinated. I'm not saying he can't get it done. If you want to know that's not going to happen then you need to go to the doctor and explain what the CDC can do.
67,54,"CANNOTANSWER: ""Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.People who are not vaccinated have been vaccinated."
67,56,"You're going to get sick, and they won't be able to stop you from eating when you don't wear a mask? That's fucking dumb. I think we should talk about it."

87,67,I was just reading this post in the mood for a joke.
91,67,"If you wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus, you will be exposed to a wide range of viruses. The problem here is the government. It does not want to make the same threats over and over, it wants to make them think that it's a symptom of a more serious problem, but it doesn't want to be the problem at all. There is no way to stop the spread of a virus without some sort of intervention from the government, and the problem is the government not letting people know that they are attempting to keep them safe and it is going to"
99,67,"Isn't it just part of the ""what I want to wear"" quote?"
67,6,It's a good idea if you're trying to get the public out of the situation. Just remember that even if you aren't vaccinated you won't get infected. You don't 'have to' fight to your death.
67,8,I don't understand this one. It's pretty ridiculous. It's really not a joke. It's a joke.
67,11,"I would love to read an article about this to see if anyone actually knows that the government has no obligation to prevent people from getting vaccinated in order to prevent people from getting sick and dying, and they need a doctor."
67,14,> My favorite part of it is how many people say 'Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
67,19,"A lot of this is funny, because the CDC isn't going to give you any reason to be offended at that. It's the best way to save the world."
67,25,"Vaccination is not a right and a responsibility, it is a duty of the person who is vaccinated."
67,26,"It's not ""just part of the"" problem, it's the ""what I want to wear"" issue."

67,33,"I know I'm not getting the vaccine here, but that's a shame the government isn't doing that."
67,34,"They said the people who have the disease and who are not vaccinated have been vaccinated, but not everyone can get it. The people who aren't vaccinated have not been vaccinated."
67,36,"In the states with the highest rates of vaccination for vaccines, vaccines and ebola vaccines are allowed at the hospital. I would recommend an outside vaccinate, if you're not vaccinated. It would be easier to do your own research and not rely on some one's judgement, which would also work in the field."
67,48,"I don't know where you're getting this from but I have no clue why it's in a US country. If it were in a US country, I would think they'd vaccinate the US in their area."

85,67,he's saying it's not funny. it's a hysterical comment and not a joke. I don't see the problem.
87,67,"This is a post that I had no reason to get excited about. I don't know if this makes sense, because I'm not the dr. That's a joke."
91,67,"I don't even know if I have ever heard this, but I will say that, since I'm not familiar with any of the NSA's methods, they have to be able to help you and keep you from feeling really embarrassed or threatened, assuming you're a little younger than me. I will also admit that I do not know if this will ever happen in the future, because I have always been a victim of the NSA and have been a part of their activities.

99,67,It is a joke. And it is a terrible idea.
67,6,"The CDC doesn't give an option, and you are not being in the minority. That is just the craziest thing ever."
67,8,You should be talking to someone about this.
67,11,So the question of whether a doctor should be in the white house is irrelevant.
67,14,"Vaccination isn't a right or a responsibility, it's a duty of the person who is vaccinated."
67,19,"We have the vaccine, so I have no problem with it. I think we should have the vaccine, too. I think it's funny that there are still people who would be offended by this, because I don't like it."

67,26,"It's not about vaccines. It's about protecting the people who do it. There are things that don't work, but they can't fix or prevent something like that, and a virulent one isn't going to work."
67,30,It's the right thing to do. A bit of that is really pretty obvious.
67,33,I thought it was funny that a doctor was wearing a mask at Christmas.
67,34,I do not believe that it's a joke. It's basically saying that someone is invading your personal health.
67,36,"Vaccination is a right and a responsibility, but there's no moral requirement to make the person who isn't vaccinated be vaccinated."
67,48,Yes. I don't care if the joke comes from an American doctor. It's a joke.
67,49,"So, a doctor being cited for not wearing a mask, who is a doctor is a big deal?"
67,54,"I'm a doctor, and I don't even know what a mask is. I don't want to hear it."
67,56,"This is my only joke, and it doesn't seem to be one of the most funny."
67,66,"I'm not a doctor, but I don't really like the notion that people should wear a mask. They are not required to wear them for that reason, but I find it somewhat funny when a friend of mine comes in with a bad case of cannomena's, ""I wear a mask while vaccinated."""
83,67,"IANAL. I’ve had my eyes open on a couple of things and I can tell you why. In the UK, this is the issue. You are allowed to use the doctor’s office. It’s called a “devil’s job,” and it is a part of the government’s mandate to keep people alive."
84,67,I don't want to have to wear a mask. But I can tell you that if you don't like the idea of that you don't want to wear a mask because it sounds uncomfortable.
85,67,"""There are plenty of other dogs who have their own problems, and while they may have no problems with their own problems, they have very little information about it."""
87,67,I have been vaccinated against the AIDS virus.
91,67,You're not going to get sick in public because you will be exposed to a large variety of viruses. You will also get sick because you will be exposed to a wider range of viruses.
99,67,It's a horrible idea.
67,6,"It's like a joke, but if you don't care for the truth, you just don't care. You're just a joke, and if you don't think that people should wear a mask, then they should never have to do it."
67,8,Is the government going to make it necessary for people to wear masks to keep people alive?
67,11,There is a government mandate for vaccination to happen. This one is just for the sake of the American public. There are no laws about that.
67,14,"In my country it's not a joke, it's a joke."
67,19,"In /r/vaccine, the article says that ""It's a joke. It's a joke, it's a lie."""
67,25,"It's a joke, not a joke. In the US, it's a joke."
67,26,"I'm in the middle of something similar. I know I had a dog named Jamya and one of my friends had cannibalism. He was not really a good person and he made a joke, but he was definitely a good guy. I was always the only person who could not believe he was a doctor."
67,30,"Vaccination is not a right, it is a moral obligation. Vaccination is a right and it doesn't mean you don't need a mask in public places."
67,33,"So, a doctor being cited for not wearing a mask at Christmas."
67,34,"I think you should see a doctor who is trained to make the effort to keep the public safe. Vaccination is a right and a responsibility, but there’s no moral requirement to make people who aren’t vaccinated be vaccinated."
67,36,"As long as you wear a mask and don't get infected by AIDS virus, that's still a good idea."
67,48,"I want to say that a doctor cited for not wearing a mask is a joke. I don't think this is a joke, it's just a prank. I'm not a doctor, but I don't really think anyone would believe that. There's a lot of stuff you can do but it's a joke. It's not a joke. It's a joke."
67,49,"I'm not sure what you mean by this, but this is in the UK."
67,54,"You have to wear a mask. I don't see it being a big deal, but a good doctor should be able to make the right decision."
67,56,I am an asshole.
67,66,"This is how you make a joke about vaccination. In the UK, they're only allowed to use the doctor's office. It's called a ""devil's job"" and it's a part of the government's mandate to keep people alive."
83,67,Getting a free mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
84,67,>The NSA and the NSA are robbing you of your rights in order to prevent the spread of HIV and other diseases.
85,67,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.idk how the NSA works or what it does not do, but in addition it makes your life much harder and the government will continue to work on a lot of different things. A couple of things that are hard to explain in English: It's called the ""Nastiest Act of All Time."" It was adopted as a sign that is in no way a threat to your dog. I mean,"
87,67,"If it makes sense for you to wear a mask outside while vaccinated, the answer is: It's useless and I hate it."
91,67,There is a lot of unintended consequences of wearing a mask. But the answer is... there's no way for this to be the same. The reason the government is so busy protecting people is because they don't have a lot of money.
99,67,"You don't feel the same. You don't wear a mask at Christmas. You wear a mask at the holidays. You don't go to the holidays at all. It doesn't stop the spread of the virus. And it wasn't for Santa, so it was made up."
67,6,I'm so sorry this is coming across this way.
67,8,This is a joke. This is a joke about a silly joke about a joke.
67,11,"It's called the ""Nastiest Act of All Time."" It was adopted as a sign that is in no way a threat to your dog. The answer is: it's useless and I hate it. There is a lot of unintended consequences of wearing a mask at the holidays. You don't go to the holidays at all. It doesn't stop the spread of the virus. And it wasn't for Santa, so it was made up."
67,14,"It's a joke, it's a joke, it's a joke."
67,19,The jokes aren't made up. They are made up.
67,25,"It's a joke, not a joke. Vaccination is a right."
67,26,"I'm a santa fan, so I'm curious as to why the santas have the right to wear masks in their houses."
67,30,I just learned that a dog that got a vaccination was not a good person. We just need to get them vaccinated.
67,33,Yes I agree with everyone who says the government is a joke and the UK is in it. The NSA is in a bit of a bind. I'm guessing there is an American person with a bad temper who wears a mask in order to prevent the spread of HIV.
67,34,"Vaccination is a right, it's a moral obligation, and I think a doctor should be able to make the right decision."
67,36,The US gov't needs to enforce the laws. I'm not sure where you're coming from.
67,48,"I'm not sure what you mean by that. I'm not sure what your meaning is, but the question you're asking isn't the 'do doctors have the right to vaccinate in a public place?'"
67,49,"I know it's a joke, but a mask in public places is a joke."
67,54,"Vaccination is a moral obligation, not a right. Vaccination is a moral obligation and it's a moral obligation to protect the public from being infected."
67,56,"If you want to say I'm an asshole, I'll bet you are. This is a joke and it's just about the fact that you're a dog lover and the whole situation makes you think it is funny. I don't think this is a good joke. But it doesn't stop the spread of the virus."
67,66,It seems that the government has a huge problem with public health awareness. What's important is the privacy of the public.
83,67,A doctor who knows how to help his patients is going to have to make a huge deal of the government to prevent their family from getting sick.
84,67,The NSA is attempting to extort money from the people that actually need to buy HIV and other diseases.
85,67,"IANAL, but I'd like to add that a lot of things are made to have an arousal. One is the'mildest' thing and the other is an act that has been done by many many governments. You're making some big claims about the NSA and a few others, all of which are not a good enough reason to be involved in this. But when you're discussing the dog's nutty behavior, and it's your dog's health that's the problem, you are probably really not going to give an honest"
87,67,My mom was vaccinated to protect me and I wore a mask outside as a reminder. I thought she might get sick or shit if she went outside and they just stopped the game. I asked her if she was okay with being vaccinated and she said yes.
91,67,"A friend of mine, [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME]"
99,67,I think wearing a mask is good for people but it's a bad idea to bring up that the anti-viral group has made it worse?
