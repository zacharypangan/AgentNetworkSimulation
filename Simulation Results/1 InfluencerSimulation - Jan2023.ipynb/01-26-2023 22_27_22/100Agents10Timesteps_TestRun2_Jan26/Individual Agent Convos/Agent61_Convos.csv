82,61,please help by following the order so we can remain open and safe for everyone whether you agree with the mask or not we need to follow the order and please be kind to the staff if they remind you they are just trying to do their job thank you all for your understanding
86,61,can we developed a mask or helmet that will protect us from corona and that everyone would have to wear to go outside for a month or that would allow us to open up the economy again
87,61,i m wearing a mask outside while vaccinated because people like you are in my face why does it bother you to the point that you are asking random people why they are doing something that makes them feel safe

87,61,Vaccines are good for you if you like people not being scared.

61,16,"When I was young, I was always scared of going into the grocery store with a large slob in my face, but it just felt so odd. I got a lot of attention from parents on the side of the street, but not enough to really have any respect for my family's safety."
61,22,I think this is the case that everyone knows there's a problem and it's a great way to help them.

62,61,A guy with a fat lip and a fat lip in wore a mask on his first flight on a flight to Canada. He threw it off because it was uncomfortable and he didn't want to wear it on a flight with a fat lip and a fat lip in. He also got pissed when he heard he was wearing a mask and was trying to be polite with everyone in the crowd. It was hilarious!
82,61,I was told I could use a mask if I was asked. I was asked to wear one so that I could do my job without them being in the way. I was told to wear a mask every day. I told my boss. I am afraid of them getting out of their way.
86,61,"I think most people are confused and confused as to why people wear a mask and then the NSA says: ""Wearing a mask or helmet that will protect us from corona and that everyone would have to wear to go outside for a month or that would allow us to open up the economy again."""
87,61,"The article is a little too sweeping, and the whole premise of this post is that some of the facts are true."
95,61,"You are too old to get vaccinated. They will be able to be vaccinated and vaccinated if you are a citizen, but they are still not able to recover from the virus."
98,61,And when you wear a mask you don't actually have to worry about losing it in the future.

61,16,I don't understand why people don't wear a mask. I don't understand why people have a bad habit of doing it.
61,22,You need to stop wearing a mask to get away from the fact that the government gave you a vaccine. This is where you get the opportunity to show your parents that they're happy to give you an option.
61,27,I don't think it's true.
61,31,I'm assuming that he is in a bad position. He is wearing a mask. But I'm not sure.
61,45,It sounds like there's a lot of pressure for people to not wear a mask when they need to get vaccinated.
61,47,Vaccination is a form of vaccination. That is the premise.
61,48,I'm a lawyer and I wore a mask. I just don't get it because it does not seem like that's the right thing to do. I just get my hands on some other thing.
61,56,This is why I feel bad for my country for being a free country.
62,61,So you wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus? That's pretty fucked up. I'd do it if it weren't for my vebbulldog. Wearing a mask in public is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
82,61,This is the most likely way to get them out of this situation.
86,61,... I feel like people here are over reacting. I've always felt like this is why people feel like they have to be afraid of being stung by a virus.
87,61,">Waving a mask outside while vaccinated... but the states still do not allow that. I do not know how to make it feel safe, but I think it's just part of the job. It's not like the health department and your government are incompatible with something. I think they think there aren't any symptom of HIV. That's why they didn't have the virus as a priority for the disease."
95,61,"In my country, you don't get a virus vaccine. You get an HIV infection vaccine, but it is also an influenza b."
98,61,"Ahhh, I figured out why I was in the first one."
100,61,>I think the real problem with wearing a mask is that it doesn't really address the issue that is spreading. I think it is more that people want to be protected from a virus.

61,13,This is pretty clear cut and I'm not sure what to get out of it.
61,16,I would go on a date with you to tell you I was a veb and I can't be here to help you. That's pretty stupid.
61,22,>I think the real problem with wearing a mask is that it doesn't really address the issue that is spreading. I think it is more that people want to be protected from a virus.
61,27,I'm not a lawyer.
61,31,"I don't understand how people can even take that as an issue that is the main issue with having a mask. The same can be said about being able to get the vaccine by wearing a mask (I'm not even sure if that's the problem) and being able to go through a quarantine. If you aren't able to get a vaccine, I feel that you would be able to get the vaccine in a way that does not allow you to take a rash or be able to fucking around with a mask."
61,45,>I feel like people here are over reacting. I've always felt like this is why people here are over reacting. I've always felt like this is why people feel like they have to be afraid of being stung by a virus.
61,47,I can’t imagine how the government would do a good job at this sort of thing. The virus is going to spread across a broad variety of countries.
