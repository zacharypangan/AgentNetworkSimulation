76,6,The CDC has not shown this problem as an excuse. It explains why Vaccination is not about prevention. It's about prevention.
78,6,> I don't know where the term for it was originally from. I know the description for it is a little bit misleading....I think the real problem with wearing a mask is that it doesn't really address the issue that is spreading. It's that it's more important than knowing a person's actual place of existence.
92,6,"Considering the article, I can't remember if you read the actual article, but as I recall, a lot of people in that sub are probably saying that the implication was that people don't understand the vaccine and instead of going to see it, they want the public to know about it."
93,6,I'm so glad that I have a new excuse to post about my friend.
6,3,"People do a lot of the same things, but they get in trouble when they don't go on the run. Typically a doctor or someone else will be able to stop them. It seems like the problem isn't the government and it's the people who can do it."
8,6,So... why does a mask cause health problems? It just seems like a prank.
9,6,I don't really care who is the victim.
15,6,OP doesn't have the right to disagree with you about anything. The government has no duty to protect. The government does not.
18,6,>I'm so stoked that you gave me the reason to stop a virus. I'm so stoked that you gave me the reason to stop a virus. Wearing a mask on a run is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask on a run is part of the measures deployed by the government. It sounds like the CDC is focusing on helping prevent this. I'm a little bit in the minority but I'm trying to make
19,6,"Wearing a mask during a pandemic is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.Vaccinations are part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.What if I were to go to the police and tell them they were going to be hacked in. Why is that joke so funny? We have the vaccine, so I have no problem with it. I think we should have the vaccine, too. I think it's funny that people are putting in their masks to help to prevent"
23,6,"OP, I read it a lot and you're right. I think people are overreacting. This is a rant, not a joke. What are you doing here? [[http://www.r/reddit.com/r/reddit/posts/2009/06/2/The-Dissistance-Band-Proved-Suppression) The underlying issue is that a person is being manipulated and if they don't believe it then they will continue using it."
32,6,"I don't even think it makes sense. The CDC has a lot of money to do that because the government has to provide it. If people don't believe it, then they should probably be prosecuted and sentenced to death."
35,6,You don't have to be vaccinated to actually get vaccines.
37,6,[((CNN))) ((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((())))))))))))))). ((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((
41,6,"Well, I don't care that you didn't..."
63,6,"It's too easy to ignore if you don't wear a mask. Almost every time people are on Thanksgiving Day, they don't really know how to wear a mask, even if you don't see it."
65,6,I believe that a lot of people aren't aware of how HIV is spread and a lot of people do not realize that a mask is necessary to protect oneself.
67,6,"It's like a joke, but if you don't care for the truth, you just don't care. You're just a joke, and if you don't think that people should wear a mask, then they should never have to do it."
73,6,"I think he's just making a joke that doesn't matter, so he's trying to make a joke."
76,6,Vaccination isn't about prevention. Vaccination is about prevention.
78,6,"Is it a prank or not, or something?"
92,6,"OP and his ""comments"" made me sad because I realized how little I respect my health. He said something like ""What's a python? What are the implications for a human being putting in a mask?"" The ""comments"" were purely a rebuke to me. It's not a joke. It's a joke. It's not a joke. Despite the fact that that is not an opinion, there's no real reason to worry about it."
93,6,Wearing a mask on a run. It's a little hard to tell when my face isn't shattered by a virus. I don't know why but this is why I can't get it.
6,3,"Honestly I'm just getting all these posts to add to the conversation, but I'm sure I'm reading about how this is going to make a difference for people."
8,6,">It seems like all the government is trying to stop the spread of the virus, and they are trying to stop it.', ""I love these stories and don't care what's going on with them because they are completely wrong and they don't really seem like it's happening."", ""I don't know what else to say here. It's not like he's the only one in this whole thing that wears a mask."", ""I love these stories and don't care what's going on with this."
9,6,"> But in the face of such things, you just have to choose between them and not get it."
15,6,I think I'm having the wrong moment to say that OP's title is misleading.
18,6,"I'm gonna be honest with you, there are a lot of sexist jokes that people say and think are a joke, I do think the whole ""Penguin Prank"" thing is a joke."
19,6,I think a lot of people here are really surprised to hear it's not part of the vaccine stance.
23,6,"I'm going to be a little cynical to start off with, but that's not the point of this article."
32,6,It's not illegal to wear a mask to prevent HIV-Infectious Diseases (in the US) but it's illegal to wear a mask while on the road to stop the spread of a virus.
35,6,> I don't think it's a prank. It's a prank. They are focusing on helping stop the spread of a virus.
37,6,The film is made by CNBC.
41,6,People wearing masks are more likely to get a virus than the government is. It's like you said...
63,6,That's the kind of thing that makes me think the CDC has a problem.
65,6,Why would people wear a mask in the face of a viral infection?
67,6,I'm so sorry this is coming across this way.
73,6,I'm going to do my part to say this:
76,6,"I've been in the situation where I've been vaccinated, I've been on a daily basis and I've noticed a huge difference. I'm sure the CDC has some problems, but we can make some progress."
78,6,"I was at a party meeting on a business trip last week. He said he thought he was a good person and that they needed to have the same attitude and respect for each other and everyone else. This is how we have been communicating with our partners and people in our lives - it's a good thing we do all that to prevent a virus."""
92,6,"It's just a joke. Getting a vaccine and knowing it doesn't mean wasting your time on a python. That is not a joke, and I think you deserve to have a positive outlook on this subject."
93,6,I don't think the CDC has anything to do with the spread of viruses. But I think the point is that the government can be manipulated and that's their job.
