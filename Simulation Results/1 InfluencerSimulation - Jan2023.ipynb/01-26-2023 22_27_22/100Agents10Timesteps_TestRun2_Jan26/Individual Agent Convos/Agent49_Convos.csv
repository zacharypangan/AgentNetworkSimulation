93,49,"I like to wear a mask when I run, and I don t think it would help if I did it on Thanksgiving or Christmas Day."
99,49,"If you're not a member of this subreddit, don't be a part of it."
101,49,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
49,5,"That's what a mask is for. When you wear it, you're addressing people."
49,48,"They also used to do it for fun when I was little. They even put up with some people who wouldn't wear their own clothes, but they wanted to help their kids."
54,49,"You're being a dick for saying something as good as ""I like wearing a mask because i can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows another friendly reminder to vaccinate your kids wear a mask "" - but you're in a similar situation. This guy is just a troll. He's so stupid he couldn't even stand that one."
67,49,The CDC has no official position in this country unless you have a very specific list of things that you could do that would help your state with.
75,49,It is the best thing ever for us to do. We need to be more proactive about preventative health. I would love to come out with my husband and have an interesting conversation about it.

93,49,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
99,49,>I'd hate to think about this for the whole time it's been written. It was my favorite movie.
101,49,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
49,5,I'm sorry but I'm not wearing a mask and I think it's very ill-intentional.
49,48,">I like wearing a mask when I run, and I don't think it would help if I did it on Thanksgiving or Christmas Day. If you're not a member of this subreddit, don't be a part of it. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
54,49,"I don't know how it's a joke. I'm not going to lie I agree with him on the subject, and I don't see why a mask is going to help a virologist. I can't imagine people wanting to get vaccinated as a medical necessity, and a simple precaution could be that they're not going to have the time to give themselves time to get vaccinated. If you really are, I'm not saying that the government is going to help prevent the spread of a virus."
67,49,"I see no reason why wearing a mask would do anything, it seems like it was a very logical choice."
75,49,>I would love to come out with my husband and have an interesting conversation about it.
85,49,"This is a really sad and ignorant way to phrase the issue. My favorite is: ""We don't wear a mask for fear of tripping over the wall."""
91,49,i think it's interesting that they are making us wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus
93,49,I think it's a pretty good analogy for a bunch of things that are done for the most part.
99,49,"I've only read it once. I've always liked a lot of santas, and I always wanted to be able to go to a santa. The only problem with a santa mask is that they're very easy to get away with."
101,49,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
49,5,">We don't wear a mask for fear of tripping over the wall."""
49,48,Wearing a mask in public and addressing people about a pandemic is not a joke at all.
54,49,This is the 'advice' for your comment.
67,49,"I'm not a CDC spokesperson but I can tell you something about the reason why wearing a mask is a good idea, especially when you're not in a fight with someone."
75,49,"Despite all this information, I would be hesitant to answer the questions you've got. This is a lot of information to answer."
85,49,"[This is a really sad and ignorant way to phrase the issue. My favorite is: ""We don't wear a mask for fear of tripping over the wall."""
91,49,>I'm obviously a huge victim of what I've described and I don't want to come across as a python. You need to really think about why you need to put out a mask to stop the spread of a virus. Those things will be abused by people with a mask if they aren't fully aware of the consequences of the misuse.
93,49,You are a troll. You are not a troll. It is a joke. It is not your fault the government is helping a virus. It's you who is trying to stop it. This is a joke that is in the cliche category of being a troll.
99,49,I think wearing a mask is a way to prevent people from being able to do things without being a little sick.
101,49,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
49,5,"In a good way, I don't care if someone is hurting my health."
49,48,I don't want to talk about this because it's just stupid to say you're being a troll.
54,49,"If you want to stop the spread of the virus and then get to the point of going out there and vaccinating your kids, you have a lot of responsibility, if you want to stop it, the people that are vaccinated should probably get the meds."
67,49,This guy has a good point. I feel bad for his husband for not wanting to wear a mask and for not wanting to be vaccinated. I'm not saying he can't get it done. If you want to know that's not going to happen then you need to go to the doctor and explain what the CDC can do.
75,49,The CDC needs to stop putting out pandemics to stop the spread of a disease - they are not forcing people to wear a mask because they are not required to. They are doing this so they don't get caught in the act.
85,49,"I think people are going to shit on him to see if this is a good idea to do, if not then they might get mad."
91,49,"I know that it's not a question of if it's worth the trouble to make yourself look like a python because it's an oxymoron, but I don't think it's a question of whether or not people have any idea what a virus is."
93,49,"If a shit head was telling me to go to a run and get my face shattered by a virus and I went to a gym, I would do so because that's a good way to avoid shit head!"
99,49,A friend of mine bought a mask for a Christmas show on Thanksgiving. He was so excited that the costume was gonna be on Christmas Eve. It was so incredibly clever. He's the only one that could say anything besides the fact that he has a mask! He's the only person I can get behind it with a hat. The guy that's wearing it is the guy who's wearing the hat. He's wearing a hat with a black sweater - what a hat
101,49,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
49,5,"Having a hat and a mask is part of a pandemic. Wearing a mask in public is a good idea, especially when you're not in a fight."
49,48,The CDC is supposed to stop putting out pandemics to stop the spread of a virus.
54,49,People who say that you are not vaccinated have been vaccinated but are not necessarily vaccinated because they don't think it's good to prevent the spread.
67,49,That guy is in the minority.
75,49,I don't think you can say I don't know what a prank is.
85,49,CANNOTANSWER - I've had a dog named Jamya who was born in 1898 I think that's a nice comment on this post.
91,49,"I didn't get the quote, but I was talking about the NSA."
93,49,"You should be wearing a mask, as the article says, when you go to the gym. If you go to a gym you can also use the bathroom."
99,49,"In my experience, people who buy masks don't even wear masks for the holidays. In fact they do make it easier to get away from the virus, which they can't avoid at all."
101,49,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
49,5,"""A friend of mine bought a mask for a Christmas show on Thanksgiving. He was so excited that the costume was gonna be on Christmas Eve. It was so incredibly clever.

49,48,I feel so bad for him.
54,49,I think people need to be informed that the government isn't doing enough to help the people who are getting sick. The CDC and NIH aren't doing enough to do enough to protect children from a virus. I think a mask is a good thing.
67,49,"I don't want to sound a little old, and I don't want to be one of the few people that knows what the CDC is."
75,49,"> I don't think there is a big problem with wearing a mask, or not knowing what a papilloma is. RIP a papilloma guy."
85,49,"A shitload of posts like this are the worst kind of antiquated. I’m sorry, but I’m sorry it was a joke."
91,49,I want to add that the article is not the actual part about the NSA and that the government is making it work. So what I said is that the idea of putting out a mask is a really good one.
93,49,Those jokes aren't cliche. They're cliche. It's just a joke.
99,49,"Unless it's something you're talking about that you can't avoid, it sounds like you should put a mask on."
101,49,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
49,5,"The article was written by a guy named Jamya from New Zealand who is a doctor who is a pediatrician who is involved in pandemic evasion. He was vaccinated, and he knows he doesn't want to risk getting a papilloma. In addition to this, he was being critical of the government for not protecting his child from a virus."
49,48,"Honestly I don't think the CDC would have made the decision to do that on Thanksgiving. I mean, it probably wouldn't have been a joke at all, but it seems like it's a good thing. It's just a joke."
54,49,I can't believe that it makes people think that it's just a joke. It's the first time in the last 20 years that I've ever had a faceless faceless face. It's like you're being the 'bad guy' out there. I don't know what they mean. The last time they told me that was in a newspaper. But they gave me one because I knew my name and had to ask.
67,49,"So, a doctor being cited for not wearing a mask, who is a doctor is a big deal?"
75,49,"Despite this information, I would be hesitant to answer the questions you've got. This is a lot of information to answer."
85,49,"I mean, there's no such thing as ""We're not going to change any of the things they've just put on our dog because we're doing it wrong."" If he wants to be a friend of the NSA, I'm not sure if he's got a better chance."
91,49,"I can't find any explanation for the NSA's ""death control"" of AIDS. That is, their own system of putting out surveillance."
93,49,[NAME] has a joke about the government trying to stop the spread of a virus (not just a joke). That's actually a good analogy.
99,49,"'The only problem with a santa mask is that they're very easy to get away with."""
101,49,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
49,5,"I've never been so embarrassed by the ''dot-dot-dot'' on my dog, nor was it a joke on me. I just want to be there for them. That's the most important thing here."
49,48,A friend of mine bought a mask for a Christmas show on Thanksgiving. He was so excited that the costume was gonna be on Christmas Eve. It was so incredibly clever. He's the only one that could say anything besides the fact that he has a mask! He's wearing a hat with a black sweater - what a hat. The guy that's wearing it is the guy who's wearing the hat. The guy who's wearing it is the guy who's wearing the mask.
54,49,"You have to be aware that people who have been vaccinated are being the bad guy out there. It's ridiculous, but it is in no way a joke."
67,49,"I'm not sure what you mean by this, but this is in the UK."
75,49,Unless you have a papilloma.
85,49,"Y'know, the problem is that the NSA is an evil company. So, you're basically saying, if someone gets a sick dog they can go away, don't do something about it. Or that they don't give the dog a treat for any reason. You don't even want to tell a dog about it."
91,49,I don't have a problem with the NSA either.
93,49,"""Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. It seems that this isn't a good joke. The article is a funny one. The whole fucking joke is a bad joke, it's not what a joke is. It's about a bunch of things. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. Is a mask part of the measures deployed by the government"
99,49,"It doesn't stop the spread of the virus. And it wasn't for Santa, so it was made up.''"
101,49,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
49,5,"It's the worst kind of joke they make, and its actually the worst."
49,48,What about if you get sick and the dog just doesn't get a chance to live? You want to live with the dog?
54,49,Its one of the reasons I'm happy to read this. I like it.
67,49,"I know it's a joke, but a mask in public places is a joke."

91,49,"In other words, [this is the kind of thing that people do that is just a weird thing for them to do.. it sounds like they have done it before. It's like there isn't a lot of money available to them, so you're going to have to be really smart to just not think about it. [Twitter has written this but I have yet to find a post with more information.](http://twitter.com/r/reddit/posts/2009/06/2/The-Dissistance-Band-"
93,49,I think it's a good analogy. I think it's funny and a little different than the 'you're not a big fan of the government' kind of joke. It's a cliche analogy about the government trying to stop the spread of a virus.
99,49,"They aren't supposed to be immune to the virus in the first place. In fact, it is a good way to prevent you from being sick."
101,49,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
