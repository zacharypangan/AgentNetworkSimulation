100,17,really interesting in light of people s resistance to wear a mask both the mask and the shopping cart are measurements of empathy
101,17,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
17,9,I don't get why people would consider the fact that they have to shave at night a sign that I don't have time to.
17,10,I shave my face when I run for work.
21,17,They actually want people to have a safer environment because they are uncomfortable.
35,17,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

47,17,[(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern's' /wiki/Eastern's 'Eastern ') is a video written by [Stanford Police Department](https://en.microsoft.com/wiki/Eastern_Police_Defense) to help prevent the spread of a virus.
48,17,A lot of people are taking the government's job as a joke and just say it. I'm not so sure about that one.
54,17,yea its interesting in light of people s resistance to wear a mask both the mask and the shopping cart are measurements of empathy
73,17,How about an organization like an anti-meat movement?
76,17,"... and in the UK, you can have a very mild infection if you wear a mask."
81,17,"This is a good one! Wear a mask at work to protect others, not yourself. That's not a nice idea."
84,17,"He said they were going to a drive up test... and he said that the public schools should also take you on the test in a couple of places where you live. he said he would take you for the test, so he has to sign the contract."
88,17,There's a funny part here. I love wearing a mask and can wear anything I want.
91,17,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
93,17,"I'm a little jealous I've only ever seen people wearing a mask in the video game community. I've always felt like people were giving me a reason to wear it, and for the same reason, I am more worried about getting infected by things that's less terrifying."
100,17,i am really curious why people don't wear masks when they are scared of being caught by a virus
101,17,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
17,9,"I'm going to rephrase that. I do like wearing my mask, but it's too uncomfortable for me to bear the fear that I'll get infected with a virus."
17,10,People wear a mask at work because they feel like it is more useful than a shirt :)
21,17,Then why is the government ignoring this as a means of stopping the spread of a virus?
35,17,"I like to wear a mask while I work in the military. My job was to give me medical advice, which I was not able to do in the field of. I just don't want to be a jerk about this."
40,17,The masks are worn for the purpose of stopping the spread of the virus.
47,17,"I like a lot of things in the media, but a lot of them are real. People don't care for the words ""sucks"" or ""dumbs"" and it seems like a lot of things are simply not meant as such."
48,17,>Isn't this a common adage?
54,17,"It's true. In the US, wearing a mask is supposed to stop the spread of a virus. Why do people use a mask, I don't see a problem with it. Wearing a mask and keeping distance is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. In the United States, wearing a mask is supposed to stop the spread of a virus."
73,17,I'm not sure why you're getting downvoted but I'm curious. You aren't talking about a statewide mask mandate.
76,17,"I don't know what's wrong with this, but I'm so sick of people trying to get me vaccinated that I don't even notice how good it is."
81,17,"No, I'm just saying that it's part of the measures deployed by the government to help stop the spread of a virus."
84,17,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
88,17,I feel like if I had a fat lip in i'd probably be the only one who could wear a mask in public.
91,17,"The only thing NSA can do about it is to make the world a more welcoming place. The same would happen to any other nation if it did not already have a public space for its citizens to play on. That said, it is a very important topic. You're not wrong to try to force everyone to play in public spaces. If you can't make people comfortable, you're wrong."
93,17,"I was also terrified of the people that tried to spread this virus through the media, but I didn't care if they could actually help anyone. So I swore to wear a mask on a run instead because the government was very concerned about spreading the virus."
100,17,"I am a little bit of a python nerd and wear masks to prevent the spread of the virus. I have found that they are the best method of preventing it because I know people who haven't tried it yet and have a feeling that a virus is spreading. In this context, it seems like one of the most effective ways to protect your child from the virus is to wear a mask. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
101,17,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
17,9,I'm a python nerd and wear masks to prevent the spread of a virus.
17,10,I love wearing masks in the US.
21,17,"It's because the government believes that public health is important in keeping a people at risk in a safe environment. But, no. I've been here. I was just going to say the same thing if you were me I would want to know how to wear a mask. Have a good day."
35,17,They aren't allowed to do it. They aren't allowed to do it.
40,17,"They don't say ""they are not wearing masks"" that's just the same as a mask."
47,17,"Yes, but if you are still a member of the government, he will not be able to legally wear a mask, as it may be a form of social security."
48,17,"I don't know if the answer is ""but you don't want to be vaccinated""? Is it, as it's usually called, ""Panthering at the Party"" in English?"
54,17,Wearing a mask to get away from the virus is part of the measures deployed by the government to stop it.
73,17,I have a python and we can't make that change because it's too big for our age group. We can't change anything if you need to.
76,17,"If you don't get vaccinated, you'll get a second shot. Vaccination is about prevention."
81,17,I don't see how wearing a mask at work does something to prevent the spread of a virus.
84,17,I don't know why he is on the road to pick the daughter up. I'm gonna go get her a face mask but I will probably be in school for a few years. Maybe if she was on that road with her boyfriend I could see the signs of her dying and what the potential is.
88,17,"Aside from being a cynical, I can say that the most hilarious and most interesting part of this whole thing is that it was an entire thread about a man who was so in love with a fat lip and wanted to be in a mask. Now we can just talk about how awesome he was and that he actually likes wearing a mask."
91,17,We're talking about the NSA.
93,17,"> Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. They also say that it's really hard to stop a virus if you don't wear a mask. So I guess that's kind of the end of the story, because I don't want to go in the first place."
100,17,I'm going to start off by saying that a python nerd isn't the only reason why people don't wear a mask and that it's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
101,17,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
17,9,I think you're in an awkward position. The only person I can believe is the government.
17,10,[It seems like one of the most effective ways to protect your child from the virus is to wear a mask. Wearing a mask at work does something to prevent the spread of a virus. I am a little bit of a python nerd and wear masks to prevent the spread of a virus. I have found that they are the best method of preventing it because I know people who haven't tried it yet and have a feeling that a virus is spreading.
21,17,"I don't think this is a good idea to say, but I do think that if a public health professional was entrusted with that job and would be able to help, they would be better off using that job instead."
35,17,"I want to make a big deal of that and have an article of that kind of story and its like, ""I want to do something more important to me than a virus."
40,17,"If you're worried about your health and health, try asking your doctor."
47,17,"There is also an official list of the federal drug programs that have the capability to put people on the front lines of the federal government to get sick - if you have any concerns, go to the state and ask to have the CDC contact you."
48,17,I don't think it's wrong to wear a mask at the party when I'm in the field.
54,17,"It is a common issue in the United States to use a mask, in a similar fashion to the Vaccines for the Infectious Diseases (Mumps). The only exception to that is in the United States where an obstructive vaccination is compulsory (in my opinion) that can be effective to prevent people from getting mumps."
73,17,"The whole problem isn't in the government's best interest, but in the people who are."
76,17,Vaccination is about prevention.
81,17,I think the funny thing here is that this sort of situation is being addressed in the article.
84,17,"Y'know, you're gonna get out of here. The other guy who's said this is just going to shit on you for being a troll, that's really a bad thing if you're going to talk about 'the public school situation' and you don't get away with it. It's really hard to see how he feels and he's only laying there in a nutshell if he's in an area with a troll or something fucking up."
88,17,I'm glad it didn't end in him falling for a new virus that he doesn't believe it's spreading.
91,17,"[Waying a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus, but the best one is to wear a face mask."
93,17,This is not what a joke is. I thought it was kind of a silly joke.
100,17,"I don't understand you, OP."
101,17,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
17,9,I’m sure the person I wrote this to probably knows more about the subject than me. I just don’t think it’s the government’s job.
17,10,"Yes, it is a joke. You're being racist."
21,17,What if I said that the doctor was a dickhead?
35,17,"The article makes a lot of sense because of the fact that the US has a lot of ways to protect sexism, but I guess the whole 'Filming a mask' thing comes up."
40,17,Why don't we just get a mask for the ebola epidemic? We are all infected. But you have to do what you can to avoid an influx of vaccines.
47,17,"Vaccination is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.There is also an official list of the federal drug programs that have the capability to put people on the front lines of the federal government to get sick. It's the main reason my wife has been to the NIH. They say she will get sick, they have to do it, I don't think the CDC is going to support it."
48,17,"In a similar vein, the joke: “I’m sorry that you’re having an issue with your mask. I’m sorry that you’re having an issue with your mask. That is the implication of the title. People use statewide masks as a campaign to prevent people from getting the virus. Apparently if the CDC and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have a law of safety around them you can wear a mask and bend over to keep your lungs open. That is the main thing to do."
54,17,Wearing a mask and keeping distance is supposed to stop the spread of the virus.
73,17,Why would you wear a mask? It isn't a good idea to try to keep a python alive. It is just so easy to do.
76,17,So you said to be wearing a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend over
81,17,"> I'm just glad to see that I’m wearing a mask in the holidays and that it’s only really the same as the masks, just not the same. It sounds like the CDC is focusing on helping prevent this. Wearing masks does not help in stopping the spread of a virus, it's useless and I hate it."
84,17,I see you've been posted about a dozen times. I'm actually looking for this link:
88,17,I've been in my 50s and I don't like wearing a mask.
91,17,I think I am in the minority.
93,17,"I'm a little jealous of the people that tried to spread this virus through the media, but I didn't care if they could actually help anyone. So I swore to wear a mask on a run instead because the government was very concerned about spreading the virus. I think this guy is really stoked that the government is not supporting this kind of stuff."
100,17,"It's the same way the US uses the word ""savage"" a lot."
101,17,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
17,9,So what was the issue when the government stopped the spread of the virus?
17,10,"""I wear a mask at work because I feel like it is more useful than a shirt :)"""
21,17,"As a child, I felt this way about getting a doctor to help me. The doctors are the only people in the community to do their part."
35,17,"My wife wears a mask because she wants to protect me. She says she gets sick, so she has to take a break from work because she’s not good at it and is not working to keep me vaccinated."
40,17,I don't think it's funny that people would make fun of him. He just did it to get the public to see he's being used to a mask.
47,17,Those who want to protect themselves from getting sick have every right to masks keep you more safe than no mask in tight settings everyone has the right to do whatever they want now at their discretion.
48,17,"Yes, I know. I'm not sure if it is a good thing. I just think it's very nice to know the first one, and then find something similar to yours, because it might get more people interested in that."
54,17,Its supposed to stop the spread of the virus. Its a part of the measures deployed by the government to help stop the spread of the virus. Wearing a mask to get away from the virus is supposed to stop the spread of a virus.
73,17,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
76,17,">He's saying that if the person in charge of this article gets a mask and bends his head and wears one, that the person will likely get infected. He's gonna go to the doctor and go to a doctor who's not doing anything to stop the spread of the virus, which may have a negative effect on him."
81,17,"I've been in the same position but in a much more conservative manner and we both said we do not like people wearing masks. I don't think that's a good idea, especially with the way it's done."
84,17,"It's not even a fucking thing. In any case, you've been overreacting."
88,17,It's been said a lot of times that the problem is that people are unaware that there is a virus in their area and have never been vaccinated.
91,17,"I can see why the NSA would want to get involved in this in any way. The NSA is always promoting a certain type of person who does not like the idea of a ""sniffball"". They aren't as open as they think."
93,17,> Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
100,17,"That's funny. I don't know how to get a life-long friend to wear a mask. I know that being scared of a virus makes me sick, but a python's not just a scare tactic, but a python costume that's worn in public makes you sick. It's the whole story of how people would be afraid of an arachnid virus if they were to be able to survive the rest of their lives without a mask and get to the same thing in a mask and"
101,17,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
17,9,"The government is using the word ""arachnid"" when its in a nutshell."
17,10,"I grew up with a very sick friend who thought this was a joke, and this is a common joke amongst children."
21,17,"Yes! And the best way to prevent the spread of the virus from being in your house is to take a mask on yourself. That's one way you can stop the spread of AIDS, and that's another way you can get some of the most expensive drugs available."
35,17,"You're not supposed to wear a mask, you should wear a mask. It's not your job to protect you or to keep you from being infected."
40,17,"The ad of the joke ""A rant"" is a joke. You may not be the most comfortable being called out for it but the majority of people will have no idea how to feel or respond to the joke. If it's all the same thing, no matter what a joke or quote is, I'll be the one to go and ban it if I see you are serious."
47,17,">I've just been going to see a video of my buddy in a mask and she has it on, so I’m pretty sure he’s going to say something like, “Hey, that would be nice to have you with me.”"
48,17,I'm a little of a feminist so I think this is a good thing to post.
54,17,"It's called'shaming', and is used by politicians, particularly in the U.S."
73,17,"You know, what a joke. I read this and it makes sense. It's funny."
76,17,"A mask is a piece of evidence that makes the claim wrong, but it is a myth that means a person cannot be immunized, especially a person with a virus in their family, and that a mask does not help stop the spread of the virus."
81,17,"""What do you want to do, my husband"", you could be the best person to do this and just ignore it, but don't tell him, ""I don't see how wearing a mask at work does something to prevent the spread of a virus."""
84,17,"This is a bit extreme, I just wanted to say that it's not too hard to understand why people are afraid to be lied to in an attempt to prevent the spread of a virus."
88,17,The truth is that a mask does not protect you from the spread of a virus. We don't know if it's spread outside of their home.
91,17,I think the NSA has the right to be a factor in the problem.
93,17,Is a mask part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus? Because I don't know the answer to that question.
100,17,A python costume is not a python costume. A python costume is a python costume.
101,17,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
17,9,So basically you have a python and a python costume...
17,10,"I've read lots of jokes about people wearing masks, but not always the best advice."
21,17,"What a joke. I was told to tell my husband to ""buy a mask""."
35,17,I have a few friends who do this and have been able to tell me they just want to have a go. I think they don't know.
40,17,"In regards to the ebola joke, the question is, how do we get people to stop being infected when the vaccines are being used to try and stop the spread of the virus?"
47,17,I'm very sorry to be of the same opinion on a bunch of topics.
48,17,"It sounds like you’re using the words, “fuck you."
54,17,">It's true. In the US, wearing a mask is supposed to stop the spread of a virus."
73,17,"I think it's a joke about how the government is inefficient, but the thing is not what's preventing AIDS. Its an act of kindness, but it's also a joke."
76,17,"They're going to need more funding, and that's going to require more smear campaigns and more awareness. You have a problem with it and can't fix it. They're going to need more money and more publicity to get your work done."
81,17,"We are in a big crisis. The CDC isn't interested in any of this stuff. I'm not a big fan of the idea, but I don't have anything against it."
84,17,*Waving a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
88,17,"I think the point is that if you have a phobia about putting on a mask in public and if you can't help it if someone is around you. I'm so sorry. That's the only way to stop a virus and also protects people, the other side is not. Wearing a mask prevents the spread of a virus. The idea that wearing a mask is needed is that we have no way to stop the spread of a virus. We don't know if it's fucking infect a "
91,17,"'We're talking about the NSA'. ''It sounds like the guy is an old CIA agent. What the NSA is doing is a horrible idea. if someone is infected by a virus, why are they so concerned about the safety of everyone in the world? I'd consider a mask on the sidewalk or in a public area and make it a point to wear one as soon as possible ''I don't think you are going to come across as a python.'', ''I don'"
93,17,It seems that this isn't a good joke.
100,17,"This seems very reasonable to me. What is the problem with it? Does it sound as if it's just an asshole thing? I don't understand what it's saying, but the way you're speaking and responding sounds quite ridiculous to me."
101,17,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
17,9,You have a python costume! It's all pretty awesome! It looks like you're really into python-like things and your face is very shiny and attractive. I like this a lot!
17,10,I don't think it's a good joke. It seems like you're trying to be clever.
21,17,"I'm not a lawyer, and I'm not a lawyer. The government is working to save the world."
35,17,"I don't see the point. It's actually pretty common. You can wear a mask on Christmas, but if you don't like the idea of being able to wear a mask when you're vaccinated, you can't wear a mask on Christmas. I have to think about that."
40,17,You don't even look at the headline right when you see the text.
47,17,"Vaccination isn't about prevention, it's about prevention."
48,17,What is the point of having a mask in a public place?
54,17,"""This is a ridiculous idea. It's a part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."""
73,17,It is not a joke. I don't really think that is an act of kindness.
76,17,Vaccination is about prevention. Vaccination is about prevention.
81,17,Those are all very valid points.
84,17,The NSA is a naive organization.
88,17,CANNOTANSWER THOSE THINGS.
91,17,> I think the NSA has the right to be a factor in the problem.'
93,17,:) I wear a mask on a run. It's a little hard to tell when my face isn't shattered by a virus. I don't know why but this is why I can't get it.
100,17,"As a python nerd myself, I like wearing masks to ward off viruses and repress the inflammatory mood, and keep the masks off my chest so I can't get sick with them."
101,17,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
17,9,"The point isn't to prevent the spread of a virus, it's to prevent a virus from spreading, it's to prevent it from spread."
17,10,This is a joke. This is an asshole joke.
21,17,There's always a place for the truth... but that's just a joke!
35,17,I believe in the truth. The US can't even make a big deal about the fact that you should not be vaccinated unless you have a helmet. This is a joke and no joke. The CDC has been doing a ton of things in the past.
40,17,>A lot of people wear masks for their health to prevent infections that don't occur.
47,17,"If someone was going to say something like, ""Hey, that would be nice to have you with me."", the CDC and the CDC could have been better off."
48,17,I just want to give you the story of my life and my husband in all circumstances.
54,17,"This is what I think is important here. It’s a ridiculous idea that everyone should use when they have a bad time in an otherwise normal life, and when people aren’t at a good time they probably have better things to do because the NSA isn’t working on it."
73,17,"Its an act of kindness, but it's also a joke. Its an act of kindness, but it's also a joke. I don't really think that is an act of kindness."
76,17,I think it's a pretty good idea to be wearing a mask. I've noticed a noticeable difference between the two.
81,17,I feel the CDC is the one that is trying to prevent the spread of AIDS.
84,17,"""I don't care about his health. He’s not telling me about it. I think it’s funny that he’s been so insensitive."""
88,17,I'm not a doctor. You need to get the flu checked out.
91,17,You are making this very explicit. It is a twisted and twisted thing to say.
93,17,"Aside from that, you could also point to something called a ""ad hominem"" or a ""reality"", which basically includes the government inventing an ad hominem as a means to stop a virus from spreading."
100,17,"It's a good idea to wear a mask because people don't like it and they're not allergic to it. I'd also consider it a very bad idea, because wearing it in the middle of a day can make a person irritable and have a lot of discomfort and will lead to an increase in self-harm."
101,17,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
