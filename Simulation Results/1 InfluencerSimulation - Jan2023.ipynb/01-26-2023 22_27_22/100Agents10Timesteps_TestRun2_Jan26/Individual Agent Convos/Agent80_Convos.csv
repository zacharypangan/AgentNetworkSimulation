80,15,oh my apologies. i don't like the mask but wearing it is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus
80,24,That's a really nice ad. Thank you for your reply!
80,40,The masks are worn for the purpose of stopping the spread of the virus.
80,62,So you are wearing a mask as part of a mask to stop the spread of a virus?
80,64,It's so creepy for people like me to be such an extreme dick.
80,71,What a nice guy he is.
82,80,>I have been doing my job for almost a decade. I need to get a life jacket on.
87,80,This is a rant about the face mask.

97,80,I'm going to guess wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
80,10,"Well, a mask has no purpose, shits a lie."
80,15,The government wants people to wear masks and not just to stop them from spreading. The government wants them to wear a mask so it's not illegal for them to do that.
80,24,"I don't understand why ctl is telling you they're working to stop a virus. There's a reason they want you to wear a mask, but the way it works is a whole lot like a hand held gun."
80,40,It's a pretty cool thing to see a bunch of people wearing a mask and then pretending to be a doctor.
80,62,This isn't a mask. It's just a mask. They're there to prevent the spread of a virus. It's supposed to stop you.
80,64,That's a great idea.
80,71,What? What do you want to do with your life?
82,80,"What is that? Your life jacket was not the first thing I thought of when I saw this, I got the feeling that if I saw this, I’d find that there’s no good in it, a new life jacket is going to be the most expensive."
87,80,A lot of people who do a r vaccination campaign are probably in the minority.

80,15,"I've heard that the government wants people to wear a mask and then pretending to be a doctor. I really think it's one of those scary things you can see on a TV show, but you can't just sit there and pretend like a doctor, you can't eat food, you can't take your life. I think you're doing a pretty good job of being an extreme dick."
80,24,The tv show /tv show / r/stfu has really good content about how people in this thread are portrayed. The tv show is about people being surrounded by people who want to protect themselves.
80,40,I wear a mask and bend over to the point where I slap on my life jacket and a mask is put in the wrong place. Having a mask and bend over to a mask will keep a virus in check while you are in the hospital. You're wearing a mask and bend over to stop a virus.
80,62,"""Have you seen this rant?"" I can't believe that I am here."
80,64,A lot of people wear masks for their health to prevent infections that don't occur. It seems like the government has an agenda.
80,71,There's not even an option for a life jacket that has the ability to be worn on the job.
82,80,"I know what you mean. But it's a fucking joke, you have a job and the government isn't really doing its job. There's no reason they shouldn't stop the fucking. The gov't is going to have a hard time ensuring their work is safe if they don't make sure they're doing their job right."
87,80,It sounds like you are an immature child who has no idea what a mask looks like.
96,80,You wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over
97,80,The most important thing here is to take this information seriously. It isn't a logical thing to say but it is a good point.
80,10,"You are a very wacky asshole. You know, you can't be a good dick."
80,15,A lot of people wear masks for their health to prevent infections that don't occur. It seems like the government has an agenda.
80,24,'I have a job and the government isn't really doing its job. There's no reason they shouldn't stop the fucking. The gov't is going to have a hard time ensuring their work is safe if they don't make sure they're doing their job right'.
80,40,People are wearing masks and pretending to be doctors in an attempt to protect themselves.
80,62,Yes. This guy is the one who lied about that.
80,64,A lot of people wear masks for their health to prevent infections that don't occur. It seems like the government has an agenda. There's not even an option for a life jacket that has the ability to be worn on the job.
80,71,I'm so sorry. I'm sorry for your loss.
82,80,> The first part of the quote was pretty bad. Then it sounded like a joke.
87,80,I'd be pretty sure you can get a face mask when you are sick without it. I just can't believe it's in the USA or anywhere.
96,80,I wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over
97,80,"""I'm going to guess wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. So what does it say? 'If I wear a mask and it doesn't stop the spread of a virus,' 'I'll not do anything else'?' Wearing a mask helps in stopping the spread of a virus."
80,10,I was thinking the same thing. A lot of people have been to that kind of medical emergency where they don't get a medical mask or even a medical device but aren't very familiar with the disease. And it is very common for people to come into the hospital without a mask or anything like that to keep their immune systems protected.

80,62,Isn't it like the government would give us some sort of excuse?
80,64,"I had a friend who was sick, so he was wearing a face mask to keep himself warm. The person was in the hospital and he couldn't find a mask, so he had to wear one. He didn't want his job to be so scary. That's why he didn't have a life jacket. It didn't protect him, just pushed him down the drain. He was in a hospital a lot. He did get a life jacket and slapped on the chest."
80,71,You look like you're in the US. That's right. The government is trying to get them to stop spreading viruses. It's not the government's job. It's the country's problem. It's not just a joke.
82,80,It's a joke and a joke.
87,80,"Vaccination is not a symptom of the virus. It is a virus that can cause people to feel more secure when they are in contact with the virus. I'd be pretty sure you can get a mask when you are sick without it. I just can't believe it's in the USA or anywhere. It's really, really, really nice of you."

97,80,"I have a friend who has a very similar problem with his mask because of a virus. She says when it's not a virus, that it will spread, or it's not safe to take off. If it's not dangerous to take off, I'll give him a good, good mask. And if he doesn't have one, I'll give him a good one. Having a good one does not prevent the spread of a virus, it's not the most effective, effective thing that actually prevents it."
80,10,I think he would have been able to get a mask and a life jacket from the hospital.
80,15,I can't believe this - you're being egregious.... you want to take the money you have to pay to live and work in the US?
80,24,I read about this on /r/stfu
80,40,This is one of the most common jokes in healthcare.
80,62,"I have never heard of a government or civilian medical device that protects you from a virus (although my husband, his doc and I still wear one). I've heard that they could just make a mask or something, or they could do it. It seems like they've only ever been able to get people to do it for one day because of the government's mandate to do so."
80,64,You're not the only one.
80,71,I have one to wear to a doctor because of this.
82,80,"There are so many ways to get money back a government contractor is just a joke, that I actually found out that the first part of the quote is actually a joke. It was a joke. A guy who hacked into a wall was a contractor, but he hacked into a wall at the government."
87,80,[Calls from the Vaccine Society to the National Committee for Disease Control & Prevention.

97,80,"It's a joke and you get a joke about a good one. But it's also a joke about how your friend can do this while you're putting on a mask. I'm not sure if he has a big phobia but he has a big phobia so it's a joke and it's a joke about a hysterical joke, but the hysterical stuff seems to be a joke. That's why the joke is the only way to stop a virus."
80,10,"I was also told the same thing about my friend who has a virus. I've never seen one. It was a joke about a man who had a'sitting down', then he put his face on the face of someone else's doctor, then a 'walking on the street', then a ""waiting for me"" for him to show up with his face on the floor when someone was in his room."

80,40,"People can wear a mask and bend over to stop the spread of a virus, because that's one of the primary reasons they get sick. The reason for that is because they believe that a mask will prevent a virus from spreading and prevents it from spreading."
80,62,A joke is a joke. A joke is a joke.
80,64,">I'm going to guess wearing a mask and it doesn't stop the spread of a virus,"
80,71,Vaccination is not a symptom of the virus. It is a virus that can cause people to feel more secure when they are in contact with the virus.
82,80,"[The first part is the omission of the quote. I'm pretty sure they are just going to give him a life jacket. I don't know the answer, but I think it's a little of both."

97,80,It says something about how this idea would be funny if I told you something that he does not have a phobia...
80,10,"I'd bet that you don't have a phobia. But then again, I don't understand how people get this way with a phobia. There's a good chance that the idea would be funny, and I think that's part of the point of the joke."
80,15,It seems like the government has an agenda. It seems like the government isn't really doing its job. There's no reason they shouldn't stop the fucking.

80,40,It's one of the most common jokes in healthcare. A lot of people wear masks for their health to prevent infections that don't occur. It seems like the government has an agenda.
80,62,I don't think that a joke is a joke. Just a joke.
80,64,I'm going to guess this is a joke about how people are getting sick and sick and sick and sick and they aren't able to get vaccines. I'm pretty sure the government isn't doing it's job. There's no reason they shouldn't stop the fucking.

97,80,People have different problems with things in different ways. Having a phobia in one or the other is a phobia and it's not useful in the other. It is a joke and it snuck in. The fact that people get sick when they wear a mask when they're at work means that they're not supposed to be sick unless they're in the hospital. I'd like to point out that masks are a fucking joke. You've never worn a mask in a phobia. But to me it's not funny
80,10,I think a lot of people who have a phobia feel a lot more secure when they are in contact with the virus. It's not a joke.

80,64,I'd rather be in the hospital than have a life jacket.
80,71,The bbq is basically just a bbq and a bbq is a bbq and a bbq is a bbq.

96,80,"I'm a big girl who grew up wearing masks, and a lot of people wouldn't wear them without a mask."
97,80,I would say that people who like sexist jokes have very different feelings. This is really sad.
