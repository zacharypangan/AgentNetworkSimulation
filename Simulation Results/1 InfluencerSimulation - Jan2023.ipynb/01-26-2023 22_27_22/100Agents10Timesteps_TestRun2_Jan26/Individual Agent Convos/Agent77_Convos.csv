77,2,"Yes, a man would love to come run with me and it will be a nice day to have a group of strangers for a second"
77,5,"YEAH, I like this!"
77,10,I can see it happening. The question is why don't you tell me what to do next if there isn't a person you care about but care about what others think you can and can't do besides play a card game and get a bunch of jokes if it was you.
77,11,"yep, they have a right to not wear a mask, but they have no right to not wear it"
77,12,"No... we don't believe there is such a thing as religion but we are here to protect us, and we aren't trying to impose our right on us based on religious beliefs."
77,29,I love running. I run for a living on a daily basis and a mask is my life.
77,35,I think I agree with him and he seems to be quite supportive.

90,77,"My friend was told to look up and make a face book. When I saw him, it was like ""Wait, now you don't have to go!"" and that he was walking along the sidewalk, doing nothing but joking, and he said ""I don't want to be seen and look out for you, I don't want to see you."" He was joking about the fact that he'd run along the sidewalk, and it was like ""But I'm running along the sidewalk, it's really hard to see me if you would wear "
100,77,r/womensis is an encyclopedia written by a man who is interested in making people understand things better.
77,2,It's a shame to scoff at people who don't like to be treated like that.
77,5,"I like a guy who runs in a mask when he runs. He's my favorite guy. But you need to get him to wear the mask! You should definitely take your family to the doctor to try it on, if you don't like it, you should stop it and get it in a box."
77,10,I think the point of wearing a mask is to allow someone to wear it. It's not like it's to keep someone able to go to work on the weekend or something like that.
77,11,"Its not a good idea to run a marathon or go to the races. If he gets attacked by a superspy, he'll wear a mask."
77,12,oh yeah it sounds kinda like a BS one. you threw a bad idea at him.
77,29,"My wife and I went to the grocery store, went to a doctor and the doctor was very rude and apologetic. He said they had a good reason to wear the mask so I was like Oh yeah I can wear a mask and be nice to you! But my friend still hid in a pj and he took it out and told me he loved him. I told him he wore the mask and he got upset, and was like ""I didn't think it was a lie"" so I knew it was a lie."
77,35,It's not a hive mind.
90,77,I'm gonna go with it. I don't think that this will get any better than the others.
100,77,"[In the current day and age of the modern technology, there are literally millions of people who are unaware that a python is alive and if you do not stop it in time your child will die. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
77,2,"I'm very sorry for your loss. My husband and I are very sorry that your friend is sick, but I know this is a really difficult situation."
77,5,I think the point of wearing a mask is to allow someone to wear it. It's not like it's to keep someone able to go to work on the weekend or something like that.

77,35,I have a friend that wears a mask.
90,77,This is where a slapstick mask should be worn.
100,77,I don't think it's so weird to think people actually wear masks.
77,2,"It's kinda cool to think this was just a nanny situation, but I guess that's how you would imagine people with HIV are treated. I do believe that the best way to protect the people is to put them in a hive mind and talk to them about what they want."
77,5,"If you go to a doctor and have someone come by to do something stupid, they'll say ""What the hell is wrong with you, buddy?"" ""I don't think it's a bad idea to be treated like that,"" ""You're a pretty clever guy."" ""I like a guy who runs in a mask when he runs. He's my favorite guy. But you need to get him to wear the mask!"" ""I think the point of wearing a mask is to allow someone to wear it. "" ""If a doctor has to go about things I would"
77,10,Using the word 'I don't think it's so weird to think people actually wear masks.'
77,11,He's a fool. What's your point. The point of wearing a mask is to let people see you.
77,12,"So you said, ""Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. I think the point of wearing a mask is to allow someone to wear it."
77,29,"That's actually pretty awesome. If I'm running, I'm going to wear a mask. My friend does. But he has to sneeze at me he needs to go to work. He also needs to wear a mask and wear a hat. He needs to wear it."
77,35,You have to wear a mask or your friend will become sick or dying.
90,77,A prank that is not about a human being is called a prank because of a fucking virus.
100,77,"I can't believe the language used to refer to this as a ""savage"" a lot."
77,2,Nope. You say it all over the Internet. What the fuck?
77,5,"I hate it when people make jokes, and then a lot of them end up using a false hoodie, and when you're the one using it in your nutjob."
77,10,"I don't think the idea of wearing a mask is a bad idea, just weird, like the way pranksters say, “Hey I think that's very cool if you think you're a pretty clever guy.”"
77,11,>He's a fool. What's your point. The point of wearing a mask is to allow someone to see you.
77,12,"I don't think the language used to refer to this as a prank is really a savage, and I'd rather not wear a mask or my health. I can't think of anything more to say. But I would say if you sneeze and then run away, it's actually pretty cool."
77,29,"It seems like a lot of people are trying to push the idea of people wearing masks and it's like people are talking about people who aren't in a position to use it. In any case, it would have to be a big deal to keep everyone from having a problem with something if people don't know what is going on in the world. So, what you just described sounds a little bit like a ""nanny situation"". You sound a lot more like an inexperienced guy."
77,35,It's pretty weird. The point of wearing a mask is to allow someone to see you.
90,77,"I'm not saying this is a prank, but if you put on a mask and a face book, it's a prank. If a mask is a prank, then it's a prank."
100,77,I like your take on this. It's not about me. It's about me. It's about the government. It doesn't make people crazy.
77,2,"I think it's really strange that the word ""prank"" is so used here."
77,5,"So, the answer to your question is ""I like a guy who runs in a mask when he runs. He's my favorite guy. But you need to get him to wear the mask!"""
77,10,"If you don't think the idea of wearing a mask is a prank, you are a nutjob."
77,11,"In a ""weird"" world, it means that there are a few things that are a prank that need to be done to stop a spread of a virus."
77,12,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. This is where a slapstick mask should be worn. I don't think it's so weird to think people actually wear masks.
77,29,"...because a prank is not a prank, it's just a prank."
77,35,"I'm not sure I'm going to be the first person to say ""I think you have to wear a mask or your friend will become sick or dying."" :("
90,77,That's the whole point of a prank.
100,77,"I think it's more like saying, ""If you get sick you will be infected."" People with a mask have no idea what a python is. They wear a mask because they have no idea what a python is. People with a mask have no idea what a python is."
77,2,The joke's part of the prank.
77,5,"""I like a guy who runs in a mask when he runs. He's my favorite guy. But you need to get him to wear the mask!"""
77,10,People with masks wear them because they want to be in the public eye and they don't want to be seen. The only way to get it off is if they see it coming and the prankster is lying.
77,11,"I love this. It's weird, but it's not a prank."
77,12,I can't get a lot of people to think that wearing a mask is a prank.
77,29,It was a prank that my friend told me about...
77,35,"I hate when people make jokes, and then a lot of them end up using a false hoodie, and when you're the one using it in your nutjob."
90,77,"> The person who wants to do it, will probably think ""a prank doesn't work"" if they're going to go and have a slapstick prank."
100,77,"I've never heard a man say, ""Potentially evil in a group, a person who loves to fuck people with a python, will be sick, and would never be able to go to a hospital and be infected,"" or a man who thinks that people who say, ""No, we don't know what a python is."" or someone who says, ""Meh, the thing is we can't protect you, but I'm not a big fan of those."""

77,5,"A prank is a prank. The purpose of a prank is not to put your face on the sidewalk, but to put on a mask."
77,10,Is it possible that they will wear a hoodie or some other costume that actually does the work? Is there a way they can put a hoodie on when the people they want to be in the public eye aren't being aware of what a python is?
77,11,"You're not the first person to say ""I don't think it's so weird that the word ""prank"" is so used here. It means ""you need to get him to wear the mask!"" It's not a prank. It's just a joke."
77,12,"In addition to all these things that were mentioned before, you also mentioned the fact that I love the word prank."
77,29,"I think I understand why you are trying to talk to me a little bit more. I mean, they're not a prank, they're a joke, you have no idea what a prank is. But they do have a right to a prank. They're not saying this is a prank, but they're being a prank. I have no idea what the problem is."
77,35,"I don't think it's a prank, but if it were, I'd think a few of the above would be a prank."
90,77,"In other words, a prank isn't supposed to work."
100,77,"The article says that if you get sick and you have no idea what a python is, if you wear a mask, you will have a really bad time."
77,2,If this were me I'd be a bit nervous about that part of a prank.
77,5,"A prank is a prank, it isn't supposed to work. A prank is a joke. It is a prank. The purpose of a prank is not to put your face on the sidewalk, but to put on a mask. Wearing a mask is a prank."
77,10,"I think that there are a lot of different versions of ""Potentially evil in a group, a person who loves to fuck people with a python, will be sick, and would never be able to go to a hospital and be infected."""
77,11,I like to run in a mask when he runs. He's my favorite guy. But now I feel like it was just a joke.
77,12,People who wear a mask will wear them because they think they're going to be abused. They're still victims of snobbery and they will be killed.
77,29,"The best way to make a prank is to put it on. In the article, if you want to make a prank, you need to get some of the things in that article - but it's really not a prank. If you have the right to do a prank, don't do it."
