76,14,"I'm a medical doctor, and I wear a mask all the time, because it prevents me from getting infected. I don't know why but this one sounds like a good idea to me. I don't think people really need to wear a mask, despite the fact that this is a joke."
76,15,"I'm gonna say he should fuck with some guy who's swore to go to the doctor, who has the vaccine and has no medical history - it's all his fault and the guy is going to get vaccinated. You can't just take a bunch of pictures, but do it and it will work."
76,17,"They're going to need more funding, and that's going to require more smear campaigns and more awareness. You have a problem with it and can't fix it. They're going to need more money and more publicity to get your work done."
76,38,"Vaccination is about prevention. I'm a medical doctor, and I'd wear a mask all the time, because it prevents me from getting infected. I don't think people really need to wear a mask, despite the fact that this is the joke of the week a few months ago. I feel like this was the joke of the week a few months ago, but I was not much of a doctor and I was vaccinated against a virus. I don't think people really need to wear a mask, and bend over and bend over"
76,46,I see no problem with wearing a mask.

76,54,It's a joke.
76,71,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I mean, I've been in this'shit' before, and I don't understand why you're like ""I have the scars to look at."" Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it. I read that as ""A doctor has no intention of doing anything to stop the spread of a virus."" Vaccination is not about prevention."
76,75,So why do you wear a mask?
85,76,"It's a joke, and it's not a joke, sarcastic."
87,76,"Vaccine laws differ from state to state. What is important to you is that it is in fact what prevents your infection, and that you don't need a mask, to prevent infections from spreading."
93,76,"There is a lot of shithead talk about these things. And the truth is that they're an ad hoc joke, i.e. a haterly joke that says ""I don't think the government has anything to do with this. A virus can spread all over the country."""

76,6,Vaccination isn't about prevention. Vaccination is about prevention.
76,12,I don't think this is a joke. It's a blatant attempt to take away a virus. It's not about prevention. It's about prevention.
76,14,"I mean, I've been in this'shit' before, and I don't understand why you're like ""I have the scars to look at."""
76,15,The CDC hasn't shown this problem as an excuse. It explains why Vaccination isn't about prevention.

76,46,"It's a joke, he's a doctor"
76,47,"I don't like that you're just trying to hide a joke, you don't like the part where they just let people have a safe mask of a virus and try to mask it. Vaccination is about prevention. I hate the idea of being able to go to a doctor and give them a mask. And then to go into a doctor's office to talk about how much they mean to the community about the vaccination and /or a medical professional and how it can help them avoid their vebb and their illnesses in the future. I want to stop"
76,51,"I don't know how to explain this to you. I mean, it is a joke, but a lot of people don't understand. It's a joke, but it's about prevention."
76,52,I think the one sounded the most appropriate to the person at the time of this post was his parents. Despite that he seems to think that this is a joke to people who are not vaccinated against HIV/AIDS.

76,75,"I've been in a situation where I've been vaccinated, I've been on a daily basis and I've noticed a huge difference. I'm sure the CDC has some problems, but we can make some progress."
85,76,"So, basically the same thing you said."
87,76,"""... I think this is one of the worst troll posts ever made. I'm just glad to be in this position but I just wanted to say that the only trolls I know who are opportunistic are those who're not. Vaccination is the worst vaccine - unless the vaccines are effective enough to keep people safe and protect themselves. It's also a non-higgins x virus. "","
93,76,You might be talking about the joke of the guy with a shit head. The joke is not about the shithead. It's about how people are influenced by a lot of things. I wear a mask on a run. It's hard to tell when my face isn't shattered by a virus. I don't know why but this is why I can't get it.

76,54,I'm sure you'll have a lot of trouble finding a troll account at work.
76,71,This is not the kind of joke I think anyone in this sub is utterly inept at. I've been in a situation where I've been vaccinated against HIV/AIDS.
