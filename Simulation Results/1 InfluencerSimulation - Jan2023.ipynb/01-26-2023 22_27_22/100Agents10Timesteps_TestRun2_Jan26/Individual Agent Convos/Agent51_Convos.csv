51,4,"I am not a lawyer, but I can tell you that you can wear a mask while vaccinated. But the difference is that the government doesn't need to provide protection for the people it's supposed to protect. He's a big gamer and a man with a mask.

73,51,I think you are being a very condescending and dick-faced person. It sounds like you have a lot to hide.
76,51,Vaccination is about prevention. We need to be more proactive about preventative health.
79,51,It seems like a very good thing for humans to not wear masks in a day. If I was on this planet I would not be able to enjoy the holiday without one of these masks.
81,51,What's wrong with wearing a mask at work to protect others?

79,51,It seems like the Americans and the Republicans have the same issues about that. The U.S. government has the power to protect against a virus that has spread. The U.S. isn't allowed to wear a mask during holidays because it's so cruel. Whether they wear a mask at Christmas or not seems unlikely. It's just that the U.S. government isn't allowed to have a mask.
81,51,You say that because you know the CDC is focusing on helping stop the spread of a virus? The CDC is focusing on this.
83,51,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.So, if you have a fecal disease, is it possible to wear a mask on an unprotected child? Then you can be covered in a fecal infection that will be in your head for a few days. Is the public's right to decide what to do? Is the public's right to decide what to do?"

51,4,A joke about wearing a mask outside isn't a joke. A joke is a joke.
51,12,"It's not an actual joke. It's a simplest form of sarcasm. The only time someone is using a mask is if they think the CDC is doing something about it, they do a joke. They should wear a mask. A mask should prevent people from getting sick from a virus. A couple of sham jokes in my post here. Why would it be a good idea to wear a mask to keep myself safe, but I don't think that is the right way to act."
51,35,"It's not an actual joke. It's a simplest form of sarcasm. The only time someone is using a mask is if they think the CDC is doing something about it, they do a joke."
51,36,So this isn't a joke.
51,41,This is not a joke.
51,50,The CDC has a policy against it. They should do that. They should do that.
52,51,">I wear a mask to keep myself safe, but I don't think that is the right way to act. In order to stop the spread of a virus, people wear a mask and then go to school without it. So there is no way to stop the spread of a virus, you don't have to do anything but try."
59,51,"The CDC has a right to say something that isn't ok. People who don't like wearing a mask are really weird. The only time I see them wearing a mask is the one I find most affable. Well, it's not an anti-virus. Vaccination isn't a health issue in a sense. People who don't like wearing a mask are really weird. The only time I see them wearing a mask is the one I find most affable."
73,51,"A mask is a tool for fighting HIV, and it is necessary for a better quality of life. You need to know this and wear a mask in a timely manner. That's why this stuff is so bad, and it should be deleted ASAP."
76,51,"I don't know how to explain this to you. I mean, it is a joke, but a lot of people don't understand. It's a joke, but it's about prevention."
79,51,This is one of the reasons they are allowed to have a mask.
81,51,"You should always wear a mask at work when sick. It protects the person who wrote it, as well as the person who wrote it, and makes people care about themselves more. This is very, very much a joke. The CDC is trying to stop it. It seems like a terribly cynical thing to do."
83,51,"As of now, we have no mandate for you to wear a mask."
84,51,A couple of sham jokes in my post here.
88,51,"I'm sorry but this story has a lot of holes. This is what I'm saying here, which is a bit strange."
91,51,">(http://www.r/reddit.com/r/reddit/posts/2009/06/2/The-Dissistance-Band-Proved-Suppression) It sounds like the guy is an old CIA agent. What the NSA is doing is a horrible idea. if someone is infected by a virus, why are they so concerned about the safety of everyone in the world?"
95,51,[Drop the mask](http://www.reddit.com/r/repair/r/repair/repair/repair/r/repair/repair_of_the_mask_and_wearing/) is a prank that was a joke.

51,4,"So, I'd say the CDC is a joke because I'm an old CIA agent."
51,12,The CDC is not a 'pill' thing.
51,35,The CDC has a policy against wearing a mask. They should do that.
51,36,A mask should prevent people from getting sick from a virus.
51,41,Vaccination is about prevention. CDC is about prevention. They should do that.
51,50,The government has a policy against it. They should do that. They should do that.
52,51,"People who wear a mask are going to have to do something for the benefit of the people who aren't vaccinated against HIV/AIDS. It's a joke. People who wear a mask while vaccinated are going to go to school without it. So there is no way to stop the spread of a virus, you don't have to do anything else, just be in a safe place, to get to know a person."
59,51,"I don't know if I agree with you on any of those, but in my country it's mandatory. I've been vaccinated for the flu. I've not even had an accident yet, but if I get sick from it, it's pretty normal. And I never wear it as a smear to avoid it. I don't feel it was necessary for me to have a vaccination. I'm not sure if you've ever thought about it but I don't even know what your talking about."
73,51,"So you're saying: It's not a joke, he's saying that because it's not an act of kindness, that he should wear a mask? It's an act of kindness, not an act of kindness. It's not a joke, but it's a joke. It's not the first time he's said ""Have fun!"" he just keeps saying it because it's not that he's doing it, it's a joke, and if he argues in this he just didn'"
76,51,"> The whole point of wearing a mask is to help prevent the spread of a virus, and that's not a joke, sarcastic. Vaccination is about prevention."
79,51,"It's a joke, isn't it?"
81,51,"I would like to see your response to smoopy little troll's ""The mask is not a joke,"" [the CDC is trying to stop the spread of a virus."
83,51,"What do you mean ""fecal disease""?"
84,51,"I cant speak for other organizations, but I've read many of the above. I think it's very true that this is a lot of work, but it's a huge concern, and is a large deal for the government. But the NSA is also doing work aimed at evicting people who need to get help."
88,51,i think i think this is one of the most important parts of the story
91,51,"The whole 'Ask me to stop a virus by doing my part' thing is a very interesting idea. I mean, if you can't stop it by making sure you can, 'Bye I'll be the one who can stop the spread of a virus by wearing my face mask' kind of pisses me off."
95,51,'Cause I'm a mask and wearing a mask and wearing a mask and wearing a mask and wearing a mask and wearing a mask and wearing a mask and wearing a mask and wearing a mask and wearing a mask and wearing a mask and wearing a mask and wearing a mask and wearing a mask and wearing a mask and wearing a mask and wearing a mask and wearing a mask and wearing a mask and wearing a mask and wearing a mask and wearing a mask and wearing a mask
