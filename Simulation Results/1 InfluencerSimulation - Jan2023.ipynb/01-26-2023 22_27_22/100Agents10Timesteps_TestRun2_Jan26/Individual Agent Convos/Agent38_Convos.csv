73,38,i like the part when he got covid but still had events with people and how he won t enforce a statewide mask mandate oh and the part where he cut education funding wow so great
75,38,don t go to a party with a house full of ppl not wasting mask during a pandemic
76,38,continuing to mask up and distance reduces the transmission of the virus and if you do get it the virus won t leave you your immune system will handle it vaccines also reduce pressure on overwhelmed healthcare systems vaccines mean more milder cases if the vaxxed do get it
82,38,please help by following the order so we can remain open and safe for everyone whether you agree with the mask or not we need to follow the order and please be kind to the staff if they remind you they are just trying to do their job thank you all for your understanding
92,38,i m so sorry mark but i don t trust this vaccine i understand your concern for the residents of erie county i obey the mask mandate wash and sterilize my hands when returning home from work and elsewhere
93,38,excellent exandle of the importance and reliance of everyone in the community to do their part the people that put themselves at risk everyday so you can have food safely produced and delivered to you to eat it s not hard to wear a mask on a run
38,2,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

38,34,I don't get a statewide mask mandate and I hate the fact that they cut education funding.
47,38,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
73,38,It seems to me that he is the first person person to have the dreadful attitude that the guy wants to make people happy if he is the one in charge of protecting people. So it s not surprising that he is doing things to support the people he's trying to be.
75,38,"They don't have any protections from the pandemic, they just have to tell the government about the pandemic so they can spread the virus. Apparently there s an outbreak and the government is doing what they need to keep it from spreading."
76,38,"This is a great idea. I want people to have a voice and do what they want to, and have a voice, because that is all that matters."

92,38,"i don't even like this subreddit, but i really like how it isn't as good as you've been posting, i wonder what the topic is"
93,38,I would say that's a good point.
38,2,"I don't see how that makes sense. He may think he's making the right choices because it's important for his government to provide basic safety for people. I think you're right that it's important, but I feel like there are a lot of people in the health care system who have to do this."
38,15,I personally know people that have gotten covid one of them past away this week please wear a mask. They have to wear a mask for this because they want to make others happy and make the people happy.
38,26,"As an ex-moldie, I can say it would be one of the most horrible things I have ever read in my life."
38,34,"I like how they seem to have a statewide mask mandate, even though the person isn't exactly on board with it. I'd say a statewide mask mandate and a statewide mask mandate are the same thing, and that doesn't necessarily make people happy."
47,38,"I see no reason why he would even consider wearing a mask. He was probably just trying to get you out of a serious situation. He is a huge part of the problem, and has nothing to do with anything."
73,38,he's a dick-faced person. I'm not even a fan of him.
75,38,"I'm not a papilloma guy, I am a papilloma person, so I'm really not sure what the difference is. Vaccination is an issue that I'm interested in but I'm not sure it's any less important than if I had the option to stay away from pandemics or if I was a huge papilloma fanatic. I also want to emphasize that people who aren't in my face are not necessarily the culprit. This is a huge problem and the biggest problem is that"
76,38,My mother has a really strong and frank opinion of vaccination in general. I do not like that people complain. She does not like me complaining about things that aren't doing anything wrong.
82,38,This is a terrible quote. The first part of the quote was quite important. Then it sounded like a joke. The first part of it was just a joke.
92,38,"I'm sorry Mark, but this is a good story."
93,38,It's really important to know that you're not the only person who wants to put yourself at risk. What do you want to protect yourself from? How do you want to protect yourself from the virus? And do you want to help people with the same symptoms? How do you want to make people care?
38,2,he's a dick faced person. I'm not even a fan of him. I'm not even a fan of him.
38,15,"i'm a big fan of these kinds of posts, but this is one of them"
38,26,"You guys are putting so much pressure on your mother, and she's being very jaded about him."
38,34,CANNOTANSWER >> I'm a papilloma guy.
47,38,"You're totally not right to call me crazy, but I've found out this week that in the last two months of the quarantine phase I have had multiple cases of a virus."
73,38,He doesn't wear a mask at work.
75,38,"I'm sure that's why people want to get their face checked on and to see their own bodies. There's no 'no' in there, not enough room for me to be in the party"
76,38,I'm a huge anti-virus fan. It's a major health issue. This is a lot more common than most people think. I like to wear my mask as a mask while running around the city and don't have it on. It's a big part of my daily life.
82,38,The first part of it was just a joke.
92,38,I am assuming a number of people in this sub aren't saying the same things.
93,38,"[NAME] [NAME]: You should wear a mask on the run to run to protect yourself, even though your mask might help you."
38,2,You know you don't want to keep yourself at risk for papilloma?
38,15,They have to wear a mask for this because they want to make others happy and make the people happy.
38,26,He is an idiot. I'm not sure if he should wear a mask or if it's not his. He should be using the same type of mask.
38,34,"""I don't get a statewide mask mandate and I hate the fact that they cut education funding."""
47,38,This is a very good idea for people with a lot of money. Is there a place to go for this type of thing?
73,38,">I'm not really that involved with his efforts to enforce that mandate, but it's nice to know that he doesn't do it. I would be wearing a mask in public but the government won't make his entire team aware of the effect."
75,38,"i'm a papilloma guy and i wear a mask, but i don't want to be a papilloma guy"
76,38,"I think he is getting a virus from wearing a mask, but it's not for the very good of him."
82,38,"I'm not sure the answer is actually 'yes' or 'no', just a nudge and a snoop. I've seen a lot of teh news outlets, and when it goes by it's always just to make people laugh, I'm sure you'll find something good. It can be a good joke, but it can also be very serious. Unless you're going to be snooping and saying, ""No you have no idea how much money's going to happen, it can be a"
92,38,"You're also a python. The problem is that a man with a mask in his mouth might go on a run, because of a virus, and he does not seem to have that confidence in him, so he wouldn't have to go out for a run unless he wanted to wear it every day."
93,38,People who don't get a mask if they get a fad are very likely to be infected with the virus. It's probably not a joke but it makes sense to be around people who don't like it.
38,2,"I know what you mean, but I can't say for sure what the answer is: ""I feel like there are a lot of people in the health care system who have to do this."" (I can't imagine how they can be putting so much pressure on the mother, and she's being very jaded about him. ) Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
38,15,"I know they are putting so much pressure on their mom, and she's being very jaded about him."
38,26,Is this the first thing that's been mentioned in this sub?
38,34,"I think it's a joke, especially because there are a lot of people whose masks they don't wear despite having a papilloma to protect themselves."
47,38,"A few days ago my wife and I were watching a game of tennis. We just started a new series on Facebook where a CDC member gave a presentation about the risks involved with putting an official virus in a people's eyes when they were at a party, and he said he was putting the mask on her face and not just in case she got sick. We're trying to be sure he doesn't mind but we're not sure what the actual situation was so they put the mask on herself. Eventually, the next time they'll have to"
73,38,"Basically they're essentially saying ""We're going to have a major government government war because the government doesn't care about the virus, that is why we need to do it!"""
75,38,There are a lot of jokes about the government wanting to prevent a pandemic.
76,38,Vaccination is about prevention. I like to wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend over
82,38,"The first part is the omission of the quote. He's not saying he's not in the US, but he's saying he's in the US and there's a lot of federal funding going into helping a government contractor."
92,38,"I was going to make a quick post about why people hate the virus... but instead of going to see it, they want the public to know about it. I guess I am gonna take a long, hard hard look at it because it is actually pretty great, but the point being is that it makes the vaccine seem less harmful, and I was really wishing it would have helped me so much."
93,38,"If the government is not using the crazies of the wiki article, I'd not say it's a joke, because I can't think of a single reason it makes a joke."
38,2,I think a lot of people in the health care system who don't get a vaccine wear one. That's part of the joke.
38,15,"I had a friend who was sick of this kind of stuff. The one person we have had a good impression of was from a guy who said, ""I've got a papilloma and I wear a mask, but I don't want to be that guy."""
38,26,They want to prevent pandemics. The fact that the CDC is in the US is probably going to get you a lot of fucking trouble.
38,34,"The first part is the omission of the quote. He's not saying he's not in the US, but he's saying he's in the US and there's a lot of federal funding going into helping a government contractor."
47,38,"I had a friend who was in an infection but a doctor said he'd never come in the room to see her, so they'd get a mask."
73,38,I think this is the one where I think that the government is inefficient.
75,38,"It is a joke, but it's not a prank. You can be offended by something but not be offended by the idea of a prank or a prank, and then the government will just say something along the lines of ""hey, it's good to have a prank and it won't work."""
76,38,You mean that if you want to have a good time and do your part to prevent this from happening in the future and the person wearing a mask will not get sick when you wear it.
82,38,"I don't know the answer, but I think it's a little of both."
92,38,"It's a terrible disease, and I can't believe it's being spread by other diseases."
93,38,Nope. You're not a troll. It's just a joke.
38,2,I am a HUGE fan of the vaccine.
38,15,I would get in trouble for wearing a mask.
38,26,My father volunteered for a vaccine program for cancer patients because he was sick of papilloma.
38,34,"I hate the government - but I would love to be able to help people who need help with things like vaccines. I think the government is inefficient and they should stop making the jokes for a better time, or at least help people who don't know about it."
47,38,"I didn't write anything about this, I didn't actually read it. It is an interesting point."
73,38,It sounds like you were insensitive. The government has nothing to do with preventing AIDS. If it is something you know that you need to stop then you have to use a mask.
75,38,papilloma virus and vaccine is not a prank.
76,38,>I wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend over
82,38,"Is the government doing their job well? There are so many ways to get money back a government contractor is just a joke. It's a joke, and a joke. It's a joke, and a joke."
92,38,"It's not a joke. It's a sham. I'm sorry for trolls, but they're so stupid. It's not a joke. They're not going to tell you, it's a joke. It's not the same as a joke."
93,38,"I'm just gonna say, ""As a doctor, I'd say wearing a mask will not be good for you, but it will be helpful for people who have a habit of using a mask to prevent or prevent a virus. I would say this isn't the correct response."""
38,2,"I'm sorry but I can't say for sure what the answer is: ""I feel like there are a lot of people in the health care system who have to do this."""
38,15,He said you're not a troll. He was joking.
38,26,I think you're just being oblivious to the fact that you're putting pressure on a friend in a prank.
38,34,Is the government doing their job well? There are so many ways to get money back a government contractor is just a joke. It's not the same as a joke.
47,38,"You've already said you don't want him to wear a mask, you've just come to realize it's been very bad for your health and the environment in general. He's in the US and should be making a real effort to help, no matter what he does. I'd not wear a mask to protect myself, but I think that he is going to make a good point, in fact, because of the way he feels about the situation."
73,38,"The guy is telling a joke. He's a dick, not a joke."
75,38,There's a lot of pranks and jokes about the government wanting to prevent a pandemic.
76,38,"Vaccination is about prevention. I'm a medical doctor, and I'd wear a mask all the time, because it prevents me from getting infected. I don't think people really need to wear a mask, despite the fact that this is the joke of the week a few months ago. I feel like this was the joke of the week a few months ago, but I was not much of a doctor and I was vaccinated against a virus. I don't think people really need to wear a mask, and bend over and bend over"
82,38,"It's a joke, and a joke. I don't think people are overreacting."
92,38,OP is right he is a python.
93,38,"I wear a mask on a run. It's hard to tell when my face isn't shattered by a virus. I don't know why, because I can't think of a single reason."
38,2,'I feel like there are a lot of people in the health care system who have to do this.''
38,15,">As a medical doctor, I'd say wearing a mask will not be good for you, but it will be helpful for people who have a habit of using a mask to prevent or prevent a virus. I think that he is going to make a good point, in fact, because of the way he feels about the situation."
38,26,I don't care who is the one who pranks. But in the same way I care who is the one who raps you.
38,34,I'd like to add that I know some people who do a mask in order to stop the spread of the virus. I don't really like that the government doesn't cut their funding either.
47,38,Vaccines and virus preventants are both extremely important and not just to save people from getting sick.
73,38,">I think it's a joke about how the government is inefficient, but the thing is not what's preventing AIDS."
75,38,"Virus and vaccines, including papilloma, is not a prank, it is an anti-vaccine campaign, and the CDC has a program to help prevent the spread of a pandemic."
76,38,"And the truth is that they're an ad hoc joke, i.e. a haterly joke that says ""I don't think the government has anything to do with this. A virus can spread all over the country."" That's a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend over"
82,38,I think he just needs to go back and get out of the wall.
92,38,[I am assuming a number of people in this sub aren't saying the same things.
93,38,I wear a mask on my run to protect myself and my friends who are infected.
38,2,"[Picture of an unvaccinated person, using a mask to protect themselves](http://www.pshwc.org/docs/repair/comments/4c-08-06/vf-cg_fcs_rpg). Vaccines are a part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
38,15,"I was a doctor for 2 years. I started wearing a mask when I had a papilloma and my mouth was broken. I didn't know what a papilloma was, but i know that it could cause me serious complications. My husband had a papilloma that was not a virus. I've never felt a virulent infection in my life, though. I just wanted to help prevent this virus, and I would wear a mask when I was infected. There are no way to help in a"
38,26,There is a joke about him not getting vaccines because he does not feel comfortable with it. It's not a joke that he needs to wear it. It's a joke that is about a lot of people complaining about the government and that he's just doing something silly. It's not the same thing as a joke.
38,34,People can get sick when they get infected.
47,38,Vaccination is one of those things.
73,38,What's the matter with the CDC? How's it treating people for the HIV virus?
75,38,There are a lot of pranks and jokes about the CDC wanting to prevent a pandemic.
76,38,"That is why it's not just a joke, it's also a joke."
82,38,There's a reason why it's so hard to understand.
92,38,"No I do not care what people say or say. I do know the implication of this. If someone told me to wear the vaccine, they'd be so angry about it that I might take a long, hard look at the implication of it."
93,38,I wear a mask every day to protect myself and my friends who are infected. It's not a joke.
