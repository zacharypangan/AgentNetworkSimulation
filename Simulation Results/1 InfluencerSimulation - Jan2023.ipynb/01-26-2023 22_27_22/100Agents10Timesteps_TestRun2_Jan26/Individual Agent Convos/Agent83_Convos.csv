83,51,"I got sick last year from wearing a mask in my car. But after I was told to shut the door, I got sick a little bit. I had to wear a helmet, put on a mask and waited a few more minutes. And I didn't want to rip myself open."
83,54,"Honestly, I agree with you on the mask, but the people in the US still don't get this message, so we're going to have to stick to them and the people in tight settings."

83,21,Is there something to be said for a person who is in a serious state and needs a medical professional to take over or is there a government mandate for people to wear a mask?
83,22,"In addition to this statement, I'm saying that a person has every right to a free mask, but the public has the right to decide what they want to do. And if there is a problem with a'safe' person wearing a mask, it's the public that needs to see it. It's not a policy that people must implement, and it's a law that a lot of people are unwilling to understand, and so we're going to need to stick to the public's safety."
83,24,So it was a mask. You didn't get the feeling that it was really scary... uh... the most important part.
83,35,"In the US, it's called a mask, and it is basically just a safety feature that is only used to keep people away from viruses. The CDC and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) aren't the only people that have been infected, and most of the people who have been infected still have the same mask."
83,37,"I've had my first child wear a mask on a regular basis, but after several days it doesn't seem to have a lasting effect."
83,43,"If you want to go to hospital, get a plastic cutoff mask. You need to go from there. Wear the mask around your nose, your mouth and ears. That is the main thing you can do, but only if you are completely covered in shit, even in hospital emergency rooms."
83,45,"My best friend wore a mask when she was sick. We went to the hospital, and went to a doctor who said they could make a mask that didn't look weird. He was so impressed that he couldn't take the tape off, so he asked her to bring a mask on in a crate. I thought she was so sick, and told her it was okay. They called the cops and tried to get him on the scene and he was actually in a doctor's office with me, but he went on to be a doctor. He"
83,47,Apparently if they have a law of safety around them you can wear a mask and bend over to keep your lungs open. I'm sure this is a good one to make sure nobody is hurt.
83,48,I’m so glad there’s one of these people who really needs a mask and it is so much fun.
83,51,"> Honestly, I agree with you on the mask, but the people in the US still don't get this message, so we're going to have to stick to them and the people in tight settings."
83,54,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
83,60,I can imagine how many people don't realize this is a standard part of government policy.
83,64,I don't know what he's talking about. He's referencing the government's commitment to prevent the spread of any new viruses. He's talking about the fact that you have a right to be able to have your brain shut and your lungs open.
83,67,It's a lot like the movie.
83,71,"It's the fucking law in that state where you get a free mask (when you can buy one) and it's illegal. I feel like I'm just a normal, nice person. It's the law in the US."
83,73,They also tell you that you should wear a mask after a lot of work. It's a good idea to wear a mask after work.
83,78,Is this part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus?

83,43,I'm just curious about the legality of the policy of using a mask. Apparently it's not a standard part of the government policy. I'm not sure why people are so skeptical about it.
83,45,"I don't see why this guy is implying ""You are a good person, but you should wear a mask and bend over to keep your lungs open."""

83,67,It is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
83,71,I think that people don't know what they're talking about when talking about it and aren't actually getting the message that's the problem.
83,73,>Is this part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus?
83,78,It’s pretty sad that someone does this as a result of a fecal disease or some other disease.
84,83,"I know it sounds harsh, but your wife sounds like the kind of person who's not in the middle of it all. I just feel bad for the person. I guess you have to go. Maybe just do it."

83,35,You can have a full-blown cold (that is why I didn’t wear it). Wearing a mask is a good idea but you don’t necessarily want to wear a mask in those settings.

83,37,"I can't see the difference in health between a mask and a fecal disease, especially if it's actually in your head. But the point is it's not a mask. It's an inhaler or air mask. The fact that a doctor will cut you out of the fecal infection can indicate that you're infected. The point is that if the doctor doesn't think there's any harm in the fecal disease, he has to have it because he knows, but that's all that matters."

83,71,Getting a free mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.It doesn't matter if it's a government mandate or not. It's a part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
83,73,IANAL. I've had my eyes open on a couple of things and I can tell you why. Isn't this part of the government's policy to stop the spread of a virus? It's not a common adage.
83,78,"Yes, wearing a mask on a child is a good idea, but not necessarily a good idea."
84,83,"I read about this on r/Raised_in_a_mamed_in_a_family_disorder and r/Raised_in_a_mamed_in_a_family-disorder and I was like ""oh, I'm tired from my job. I'm really tired from my job. I'm a little tired from my job."

83,4,[The media](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/raised_in_a_mamed_in_a_family_disorder) is trying to get people to stop wearing masks in public. The article says it is not part of the government's policy to stop the spread of a virus.
83,7,"I know the one who used to be a CDC and NIH expert, but isn't a physician?"
83,8,> The fact that a mask doesn't have any effect on the child is really scary.

83,18,I’ve heard this one before. They say they are working on this. They have an office that does not care about getting sick and only takes care of children.
83,21,So you want to protect yourself from getting sick?
83,22,It's a part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
83,24,"A lot of people in that sub are getting away with things like wearing the CDC-funded scleroderma vaccine, but are not getting away with it since it is the only way to deal with the infection."
83,35,"Wearing a mask in a very tight, tight room is what is intended to keep your family safe, and it's a good idea to protect yourself."
83,37,"It's a good idea, but it's not really the right thing to do."
83,43,If I had a fecal infection (as a result of a drug) I wouldn't wear a mask on a person without a mask.
83,45,"> The article says that ""Women who want to protect themselves from getting sick have every right to masks keep you more safe than no mask in tight settings everyone has the right to do whatever they want now at their discretion. """
83,47,"There's a lot to go around to protect people from fecal infections in general, and that's why a mask is needed."
83,48,There's also a CDC/NIH report about the safety of a man using a mask to protect his child and his family.
83,51,"In my state, the vaccines are not a very popular choice. It's the only form of vaccine that could be useful for preventing infection of the lungs. This may not be the best use of the medical system, but it's likely that there's a reason that doctors don't buy a mask and therefore they're not going to give a medical opinion on the specifics of the fecal virus."
83,54,"So, the government is not sending this information to the medical community. It's not going to stop a virus, not stop it, not stop it, but, instead, it will only keep it there until there's something worse that could possibly happen. It will be a big change in the political landscape and more powerful than a single single person who will have no recourse to the CDC and NIH. The media will continue to believe that the CDC and NIH are doing the best they can to fight for them and not stop them, which isn't necessary."
83,60,"That's why it's illegal for medical aid providers to prescribe me a fecal virus. I know that it is pretty important, but if there isn't any government mandate it's a very bad idea. I would say that it's a good idea to help protect yourself. It's not a bad idea."
83,64,IANAL. I've had my eyes open on a couple of things and I can tell you why.
83,67,"In the UK, this is the issue. You are allowed to use the doctor's office."
83,71,"It’s called a “devil’s job,” and it is a part of the government’s mandate to keep people alive. So if it’s on the government’s agenda that you don’t get sick, why not put a mask on the child? Especially if it’s the government’s mandate to prevent infection in a way that isn’t just a part of the government’s mandate."
83,73,"So a dr.? I am not sure if I'm being sarcastic or not, but if I'm not comfortable, I'd want to go to the doctor and talk to him to get the proper advice on how to use the medical aid. The guy is talking to a friend, and he just hasn't spoken to him about it."
83,78,This is just an example of what you're missing:
84,83,I would rather not wear a mask because it sounds uncomfortable.

83,4,"I mean, a doctor isn't supposed to be making money from a virus, but they are just trying to prevent it from spreading. This isn't what I would do."
83,7,I have a doctor at work who prescribes the scleroderma vaccine in our office. I want to be able to see and know how to be comfortable. But they don't have a mandate to be able to prescribe the vaccine.
83,8,"I had a friend who was sick and he tried to wear a mask and they were unable to fix it. I got a new one, I've been told to just do what I want with it, it's a pretty good idea."
83,13,"This is a lot more of a political issue, but I can see why people are not interested in what's happening and why the public isn't interested in what is happening."
83,18,"I'm not familiar with what I just read. In the US it's legal to have a scleroderma vaccination. If they've not been around for as long as I remember I'm not a doctor. In the US, there are many different kinds of medical care: opportunistic, and all kinds of medical professionals."
83,21,I've read several t-shirts and I just wanted to say you're right.

83,24,You are an idiot. You are an idiot. That's why you are the idiot.
83,35,And yet you continue to look at the facts?
83,37,In California I have a problem with my helmet. I feel so vulnerable. My dentist will give me one because I feel sick and it will cause some serious trouble if I don't know how to use a mask correctly. In my state the doctors may have to use gloves but the meds on the patients may be better suited to the person.
83,43,"It's a shame because, in the US, medical aid is not a necessity, but that's why it should be a thing, because doctors don't feel it's necessary, and a person can choose to wear whatever they want and still not be safe."
83,45,"It is legal in the US, where doctors have no rights to prescribe them and therefore they are allowed to wear any form of mask they wish to be prescribed."
83,47,"In general, we want to prevent those who don't wear masks."
83,48,I would put on a mask and I would wear a mask to prevent me from becoming sick.
83,51,They should wear a mask. A mask should prevent people from getting sick from a virus.
83,54,It's the same here with a medical bill that has to be passed by Congress.
83,60,"In the US, the only form of vaccine that can treat a virus is infected blood, so it is illegal to prescribe a vaccine to a child."

83,21,I'm not a doctor but I am a huge medical professional who has a lot of experience with the treatment of infectious disease. It is possible for anyone that is in an emergency to do what is necessary to save them.
83,22,People who want to wear a mask can wear one without a mask because they feel uncomfortable. Is that what you are saying a tv show you aren't going to be interested in?
83,24,"I don't really understand the context of the statement in question. Basically, you're right that a doctor can prescribe the scleroderma vaccine for free as long as he's willing to pay for it, so that you have the right to be able to get the scleroderma vaccination. But it seems like the law of the land is not quite as clear as we think."
83,35,My ex ex worked at a hospital with a scleroderma vaccine on his helmet. The doctor gave the rest of the family a rash. When my dad came back from the vaccination the doctor asked me to have a different mask on since the symptoms stayed with him. He would ask me to do it.
83,37,"That's really scary. There are so many things you can do that you might not feel comfortable using a mask, because the doctors are too busy treating sick people and they have to put more effort into it."
