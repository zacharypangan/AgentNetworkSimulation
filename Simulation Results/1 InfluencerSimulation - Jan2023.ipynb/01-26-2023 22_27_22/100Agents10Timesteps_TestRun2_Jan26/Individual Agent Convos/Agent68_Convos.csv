68,21,was behind a guy at eleven who was wearing his welders mask he could have just said i forgot it when he didn t have a face mask but instead he put others first you know what you call a person like that a patriot
70,68,as encouraging as this news is please remember that this new cdc guideline still calls for wearing masks in federal facilities including airports mask wearing vaccinated or not is still required at syr and all u s airports
73,68,i like the part when he got covid but still had events with people and how he won t enforce a statewide mask mandate oh and the part where he cut education funding wow so great
93,68,excellent exandle of the importance and reliance of everyone in the community to do their part the people that put themselves at risk everyday so you can have food safely produced and delivered to you to eat it s not hard to wear a mask on a run
100,68,really interesting in light of people s resistance to wear a mask both the mask and the shopping cart are measurements of empathy

70,68,It's like a CDC thing.
73,68,"I would not wear a mask in public unless i were in a private space with people on my phone, because they may see a face mask."

68,21,"Its like a CDC thing. I would not wear a mask in public unless i were in a private space with people on my phone, because they may see a face mask. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
70,68,"I'd say the problem is that if the government has a policy to prevent the spread of a virus (and I think it does, and it has a policy to help prevent it) then it's unlikely that the government will care about stopping the spread of the virus."
73,68,No. That's not a bad thing. If the masks were to stop the spread of the virus then it'd be really hard to stop.
93,68,The underlying idea that people are infected by the virus is based on the fact that a man is infected with the virus.
100,68,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
68,21,This guy is a patriot. He deserves to be seen with a face mask.
70,68,"You're saying that the CDC is trying to help the CDC keep up with the health care needs of the country. That's pathetic, too."
73,68,"I’m the one who thinks that in a perfect world, all a dick can do is put a mask on. I think that in the world a dick can’t get on a mask that’s used to remove a virus (that makes it easier to get the virus out of your body)."
93,68,"If I wanted a joke on a joke I'd just say,"
100,68,"People who don't know what a ""walking mask"" is, are really weird. I don't know what the definition of a ""walking mask"" is, but I think this is what people say. There are actually people who are so very, very strange and strange that they think they are very cool."
68,21,"Unless you want to be a patriot and it sounds like they are, then it's not a patriot."
70,68,"> We should wear a mask in every emergency, and the CDC can't make it a ""must be vaccinated"" policy. They can make it a ""must be vaccinated"" policy, but that's not the policy here."
73,68,A man has a python that he grew up with and the government does not want to enforce.
93,68,"Nope, it's really funny. I'm a nerd but I'm more of a person who wears a mask a lot because of this. I like the way you do it."
100,68,I think the biggest problem with wearing a mask is that it doesn't really address the issue that is spreading.
68,21,He's just a patriot and I don't think he can be in a position to become a patriot.
70,68,">We should wear a mask in every emergency, and the CDC can't make it a ""must be vaccinated"" policy. They can make it a ""must be vaccinated"" policy, but that's not the policy here. So you have a few choices here."
73,68,"This is not a retort, it's an etymology. It's a political thing and is not a government thing."
93,68,[(https://n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous-Facial-Relationships/The-Infectious_Violence-Virus) is part of the article's title.
100,68,"You might be looking at ""savage"" as an a python costume. That has nothing to do with wearing a mask. This is a different thing than a mask with a python tattoo."
68,21,"People that are crazy can be crazy if they wear masks. They can just look at someone as strange, but it sounds like a very simple thing to do to a crazy person."
70,68,">We have a rule that says the public is required to wear a mask to stop this. That's an idiotic rule, because they have no other right to do so. So what are you going to do with the mask?"
73,68,"The mask thing is funny because they've called it ""a retort"" and you didn't think about it."
93,68,The thing about wearing a mask is that it causes an infected person to feel nauseous. If I wanted to play a game I'd wear a mask for the same reason.
100,68,I think you just blew it off and you're being kind of weird.
68,21,"The mask thing is funny because they've called it ""a retort"" and you didn't think about it."
70,68,"That's kinda what the CDC says. And if you get sick from a virus then the CDC is trying to help keep up with the government's health care needs of the country. That's not the policy here. Rather than making the CDC a mandatory insurance agent it's more like "" If you get sick from a virus you will be infected."""
73,68,"I'm trying to put the CDC out on a mission to stop HIV. It's getting there and I want to fucking fix it, not just kill it. That's the problem. Then a bunch of people get sick of it and then die."
93,68,Wearing a mask on a run.
100,68,"I have never had a problem with wearing a mask, and it really feels like it's helping to stop the spread of a virus."
68,21,It's a political thing and is not a government thing.
70,68,I think they're going to be ok with this. They're still a pity.
73,68,"It sounds like he wants to do the CDC work, and that he's trying to stop AIDS. You are a dickhead, I'm also a doctor, and it sounds like he's working on a new HIV vaccine and a vebbulbdog."
93,68,"""Use a mask on a run"""
100,68,"I would like to say that I don't like wearing a mask because I don't know what a python is. I think that my sense of humor is based off my understanding of what a python is. However, I also have some opinions of what it means to wear a mask, so I think it's nice that you don't wear a mask."
68,21,"It has been around for a long time, and I can't stand it if we continue to see it being worn by people. It's not my opinion that we should wear a mask in every emergency or that we should prevent it from spreading."
70,68,">I thought that if you get sick from a virus you will be infected."""
73,68,"You haven't fought for this guy's health or being in a public place, hasn't it? The CDC has just been out of town for three years now and we're still battling this epidemic. They just don't want anyone in their lives to live like that, so it's not a good idea to wear one on your birthday."
93,68,This isn't a joke. This is a joke.
100,68,The thing is I wear a mask in the middle of the day and if I get sick I won't get infected.
68,21,"... and I also have some opinions of what it means to wear a mask, so I think it's nice that you don't wear a mask"
70,68,"""This is what is referred to in a bit about what is called a ""no vaccination"" response."""
73,68,I want to thank the guy for not mentioning that this shit isn't a joke or a joke. Isn't it a joke? Isn't it a joke.
93,68,"CANNOTANSWER: I'm not a nerd, but I like the way you do it. I wear a mask on a run."
100,68,The biggest problem I see in this sub is that they are attempting to make fun of the people wearing the masks.
