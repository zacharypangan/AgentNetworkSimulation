100,91,really interesting in light of people s resistance to wear a mask both the mask and the shopping cart are measurements of empathy
91,1,In the UK it's mandatory for everyone to wear a mask in public. Its only mandatory for everyone in the UK
91,2,>We are wearing a mask to prevent the spread of the virus
91,8,Yes.... we do. And you can see in the comments that we can do it.
91,9,"I'm going to go with the second best friend of the group, in a couple of weeks I'll see his mask on."
91,10,"Hey mate, it's been a few weeks since I left my house - a few days ago a woman bought a mask for me. Then I took it off and threw it on the floor. We have been going for 6 years and it was really nice to be outside but he's already a bit uninvolved, he's probably been wearing it for about 2 weeks now. It's not fun, but it's a really cool idea - so I figured it was good to come out and we can go into business together"
91,12,"Considering people are not allowed to wear a mask in public, it sounds like there may be something wrong with that. People also don't want to wear masks for a reason."

91,1,It's mandatory for everyone in the UK to wear a mask. The rest of the country doesn't even need to wear it.
91,2,It is the anti - health insurance scam. The anti - anti - HIV scam is a way to go.
91,8,That's a really good way to start the conversation.
91,9,I don't think I see the problem with this. It's the mask that the NSA is trying to solve. It's a mask you're wearing in your everyday life.
91,10,People want to wear masks.
91,12,...and I want to make sure that every person I meet and interact with at work or on the playground wears a mask.
91,15,Then get a face mask.
91,17,"The only thing NSA can do about it is to make the world a more welcoming place. The same would happen to any other nation if it did not already have a public space for its citizens to play on. That said, it is a very important topic. You're not wrong to try to force everyone to play in public spaces. If you can't make people comfortable, you're wrong."

91,67,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
91,69,You can't keep a hygienic face mask on on the table that doesn't fit on a computer.
91,71,Is it worth it to have this conversation to discuss the use of a mask by people?
91,73,"i'd rather play paintball in private rather than with someone. The most common dietary advice is to wear a mask, but the best one is to use a face mask."

91,87,I'd like to share my story with you because I don't think you're going to hear your story.
100,91,"And I have to tell you, they're not even a bunch of people with a mask. They're just a bunch of people with a mask who wear a mask and then just wear a mask and a mask, a little like a python."
91,1,The NSA is doing everything in their power to protect the public from the spread of a virus and also to stop it.
91,2,"As someone who's had a family who carries a mask since I was in school, I know this phrase - ""... I can only imagine how much this person will resent my shit in front of all the people that are just playing paintball!"""
91,8,"So I am saying that this is a kind of propaganda, like if we are to stop the spread of viruses we are to prevent them."

91,17,We're talking about the NSA.
91,19,"In terms of the NSA, there is a huge difference between this and a full-on, mass armed group that tries to destroy other groups."
91,22,i would have hated to hear this on a regular basis. this isnt so easy.
91,23,"... but the best one is to wear a face mask. In my opinion, the public needs to be better aware of what the people who play paintball like wear. If the government is able to stop it and isn't making the community aware of the effect, that's a big win."
91,25,"And the thing is that the most common dietary advice is to wear a mask, but the best one is to use a face mask."
91,30,"If you're not on the Internet, you have a huge problem."
91,36,"""...I can only imagine how much this person will resent my shit in front of all the people that are just playing paintball!"""
91,42,"In my experience, if we're going to have a major government government war I'd probably look into changing to the government's stance against terrorism and the like - that's an awful premise - they would do a huge favor by not getting into the ""open for public play"" business."
91,43,"I don't know about people who wear masks. But the only people in my life that have a mask are the ones that actually get a virus. Generally, when people are trying to get rid of the virus, they aren't going to notice them. I think they're just a bunch of people that don't need a mask."
91,47,"This is a common misconception that a person can make an attempt to prevent the spread of a virus, which is a problem that is clearly not a problem with government. If your family doesn't like the act of stealing, you can't really complain because they are not that interested in being able to help."
91,49,i think it's interesting that they are making us wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus
91,51,I can't help but think of a good way to describe the issue in general. You're obviously a huge victim of what I've described and I don't want to come across as a python. You need to really think about why you need to put out a face mask to stop the spread of a virus.
91,54,"Those things will be abused by people with a mask if they aren't fully aware of the consequences of the misuse. Its not that people are doing the right thing, it's just that they don't realize that they're doing the right thing."
91,64,"Heheh, you gotta know the fact that there are so many people in the world who don't get the message."
91,67,A mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
91,69,"I don't know the difference between ""in your mind"" and ""in your head"" but ""in your mind"" sounds more like a comparison compared to ""in my head."""
91,71,"So you guys got a big head laugh, you guys have a big head laugh. Let them laugh. I'm gonna lie, I'm laughing, I'm not even sure what I want to hear, I'm just thinking."
91,73,The government's only role is to prevent the spread of a virus.
91,84,"It would be so easy to narrate that the person in this sub isn't in the middle of the action and it seems that the people in the comment threads have just been smacked, and it's still not fully understood what this is about."
91,85,I'm a little tired of people wearing the same face mask.
91,86,"> This is my favorite part of the NSA', 'I know that my environment has very little social interaction with other people. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
91,87,"The idea of a 'protectionism' is a lie, but that's not the problem. The issue of people with a face mask, at the least, is the problem of people who don't know or care about the virus."
100,91,"""I have to tell you, they're not even a bunch of people with a mask. They're just a bunch of people with a mask who wear a mask and then just wear a mask and a mask, a little like a python."""
91,1,So he has a bad experience with the NSA and a good one of this:
91,2,"That's a great quote, it doesn't sound like it really means anything."
91,8,"I am sure that most people don't understand why people can wear a mask or what to do in order to be able to play the game, because they know that if a person is just using one and is willing to do it, then they will be more likely to respond negatively than a non-smoker."
91,9,"I think the problem with the whole ""I'm not even a bunch of people with a mask. They're just a bunch of people with a mask who wear a mask and then just wear a mask and a mask, a little like a python."" mentality is so weird and a bit strange, I'm not even gonna go and talk to you, but if you're asking my opinion, it's pretty cool."
91,10,...I can only imagine how much this person will resent my shit in front of all the people that are just playing paintball!
91,12,"I would not like to see a person wearing a face mask. I would like to see my wife wearing a face mask, or at least I would appreciate the idea. But I wouldn't want to be seen with a face mask, and would think of an example of my life being a ""waste of a face mask"" - a person with a face mask."
91,15,"I know that a lot of things are very misleading, but what if we don't get it correctly?"
91,17,"[Waying a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus, but the best one is to wear a face mask."
91,19,>We are just a bunch of people with a mask
91,22,"My father had a face mask as a kid. It was a joke, but he thought it was the best mask."
91,23,I like the way it is a part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. Its part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
91,25,"I'm not getting any of the advice but I think a lot of the op used to be like this - people with a mask can't just say ""well it's only because you're wearing a mask."" Hence the title, you're only in the beginning of it, not the middle of it."
91,30,"If you're not on the Internet, you have a huge problem."
91,36,"If you don't wear a mask that will keep the virus away from the public, don't bother, the public can't be a safe environment, and the government isn't going to get involved."
91,42,This is about how government and private entities create and protect their own people.
91,43,"It's not like a person can make an attempt to stop a virus. The virus is spreading. If it's spread by the government, it's not going to be spread to others, it's being spread to others."
91,47,"I'd like to add this to the discussion: """
91,49,>I'm obviously a huge victim of what I've described and I don't want to come across as a python. You need to really think about why you need to put out a mask to stop the spread of a virus. Those things will be abused by people with a mask if they aren't fully aware of the consequences of the misuse.
91,51,">As someone who has had a family played paintball since I was in school, i know this phrase - ""... I can only imagine how much this person will resent my shit in front of all the people that are just playing paintball!"""
91,54,"I’ve got a great question for everyone else. [There are several topics that I’d want to talk about here. There’s one thing that makes me think of it as I’m thinking of what I’m doing, but I don’t have any ideas about how I can get the conversation going and I don’t know what I’m going to say."
91,64,"The most important part is the ""avoid government intervention""."
91,67,It is actually the government's only role to prevent the spread of a virus. They are making it so much more effective than it should be. They are also trying to extort money away from the people who actually need to buy the virus.
91,69,...and the worst part of this is that the government is not interested in supporting anyone who can stop it and is attempting to stop it.
91,71,"He isn't a lawyer, nor do he have any authority over what they do. The government carries out a lot of shit and is not always forthcoming. There's only a small amount of public attention that it gets."
91,73,"I think they would say something like ""Why's that a common misconception?"", and that they want us to do the right thing. Basically they're essentially saying ""We're going to have a major government government war because the government doesn't care about the virus, that is why we need to do it!"""
91,84,"> This is my favorite part of the NSA', 'I know that my environment has very little social interaction with other people. Wearing a mask to stop the spread of a virus."
91,85,"...the idea of a 'protectionism' is a lie, but that's not the problem."
91,86,I don't think the government is really doing any good. They're just telling the truth.
91,87,"""...I can only imagine how much this person will resent my shit in front of all the people that are just playing paintball!"""
100,91,People with a mask have no idea what a python is. They wear a mask because they have no idea what a python is. They have no idea what a python is. I think this is what people say.
91,1,It's not mandatory. The NSA is doing everything in their power to protect the public from the spread of a virus. They are trying to extort money away from the people who actually need to buy the virus.
91,2,"There is a huge difference between ""I am trying to help a little bit"" and ""I can only imagine how much this person will resent my shit in front of all the people that are just playing paintball!""."
91,8,"This isn't the government. It's how they manipulate people. It's how the NSA decides the direction the government is going. They're not just talking about this issue, they're just making it up."
91,9,This is my favorite part of the NSA. I know that my environment has very little social interaction with other people. Wearing a mask to stop the spread of a virus.
91,10,"I'm so glad the NSA is putting more effort into fighting the government and is threatening to retaliate against people who don't get to help prevent the virus. The NSA has spent money on this, as well as the US government and is the only body that has fought it. You need to have some understanding of the facts and it's purpose:"
91,12,"If the government wants to go after their own people, then they should, but not for their own personal good. They would better protect their own lives. They're being pushed to do the right thing."
91,15,"When people are not really using the word ""saddle a virus"", they are using a false name that says'saddle a virus, and', which isn't exactly a lie. It's not really a good idea to say it's spreading, and then in the future you will just see it. If you wear a mask, you may as well just take it off, like a rat."
91,17,I think I am in the minority.
91,19,I don't think the best people are going to make this conversation about it.
91,22,This is really a great discussion.
91,23,That part is a good point.
91,25,"You're only in the beginning of it, not the middle of it. I'm a big fan of the NSA's use of it."
91,30,"I love this quote, but it doesn’t fit a story -"
91,36,...and the worst part of this is that the government isn't interested in supporting anyone who can stop it and is attempting to stop it.
91,42,It's not about how government and private entities create and protect their own people. It's about how they create and protect their own people.
91,43,Is there a lot you'd like to talk about?
91,47,"This is a fantastic response. It's like, well, this is a bit of a sarcastic quote from the NSA. I don't think you've ever heard the phrase ""I don't think you are going to come across as a python. You need to really think about why you need to put out a mask to stop the spread of a virus."""
91,49,"I know that it's not a question of if it's worth the trouble to make yourself look like a python because it's an oxymoron, but I don't think it's a question of whether or not people have any idea what a virus is."
91,51,"There's a big difference between a mask and a real person, and a real person can be a python to the extent that it's part of a mask, as long as you're not the one causing the disease."
91,54,I think you've got a great question for everyone else. This is about how government and private entities create and protect their own people.
91,64,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I like the way it is a part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
91,67,"If you wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus, you will be exposed to a wide range of viruses. The problem here is the government. It does not want to make the same threats over and over, it wants to make them think that it's a symptom of a more serious problem, but it doesn't want to be the problem at all. There is no way to stop the spread of a virus without some sort of intervention from the government, and the problem is the government not letting people know that they are attempting to keep them safe and it is going to"
91,69,"I want you to know that there is a big issue with a mask that people don't wear, so you're essentially saying it's necessary. You need to understand that."
91,71,'The mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
91,73,"It isn't an involuntary government war, it's an involuntary one. This isn't a conspiracy or a morally correct and inexcusable conspiracy to prevent the spread of a virus. Unless your friends are in the military, then they have no duty to try to stop it."
91,84,They are trying to stop it. They are trying to stop it. They are threatening to extort money away from the people that actually need to buy the virus.
91,85,"You guys are playing an awesome game of paintball on tv. If you're doing the right thing, you should probably wear a mask to avoid it spreading."
91,86,"[This is my favorite part of the NSA', 'I know that my environment has very little social interaction with other people. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.',"
91,87,"I was going to ask you, but I thought you said it best."
100,91,"I've been to this school, shattered a mask at the kids, dressed in a costume, I was born in the 70s, and my father always wanted us to take them for a walk. I'm still a kid though."
91,1,I read this as a kid.
91,2,Is this the kind of person who can be the most effective anti-viral. They're trying to create a social environment where we can all be the better people we can be.
91,8,[NAME] is not a political party. They are a state run organization that works with people like you to stop the spread of a virus.
91,9,"So the government is threatening to extort money from the people that actually need to buy the virus? It isn't a war, it's a conspiracy."
91,10,...and the worst part of this is that the government isn’t interested in supporting anyone who can stop it and is attempting to stop it.
91,12,People don't want to wear a mask in public. They just want people to know they're doing the right thing.
91,15,"Those were the days. The NSA isn't really the ones who are, in fact, a tool."
91,17,"I can see why the NSA would want to get involved in this in any way. The NSA is always promoting a certain type of person who does not like the idea of a ""sniffball"". They aren't as open as they think."
91,19,This is pretty much the worst thing I've read in years.
91,22,The first line is the worst part. It is not about how government and private entities create and protect their own people.
91,23,The quote from the article is actually actually a part of how the government is using the NSA's surveillance method.
91,25,"I've been in this op game a few times, and it sounds like a funny joke."
91,30,This is the kind of quote I would be willing to pass up if I were you. I'm not. You've never heard of that saying before. You're not wrong.
91,36,"I've never heard a person say this: I don't think he's a python, but I've gotten a lot of advice on how to prevent a virus."
91,42,"The NSA's ""I don't think you are going to come across as a python. You need to really think about why you need to put out a mask to stop the spread of a virus."" I think it's a great response to say it best."
91,43,"A mask helps protect you against a virus. You are in the NSA if you want to see it, so that's a good point. I know that is the whole point, but there is no such thing as a'shark' at all."
91,47,"I'm not sure if the NSA understands that or not, but what i'm asking is ""why?"""
91,49,"I didn't get the quote, but I was talking about the NSA."
91,51,There is no way to stop the spread of a virus without some sort of intervention from the government. This isn't a conspiracy.
91,54,I don't understand why you think that it's not about what's happening and what'sn't.
91,64,It's a problem that they have to take care of. Isn't that a big a problem?
91,67,"I don't even know if I have ever heard this, but I will say that, since I'm not familiar with any of the NSA's methods, they have to be able to help you and keep you from feeling really embarrassed or threatened, assuming you're a little younger than me. I will also admit that I do not know if this will ever happen in the future, because I have always been a victim of the NSA and have been a part of their activities. I don't really care enough to give up that a mask or a shirt and"
91,69,"A good example of this is the CIA being a good guy - ""The NSA is making a bomb on a family friend. So now the kids don't know what a virus is, they know that if you tell them you don't have a virus, they might be interested in having you wear a mask."" That's the part of the NSA's argument that you shouldn't be using your mask to hide a virus."
91,71,"If you wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus, you are actually doing the right thing."
91,73,"No, I was being polite, and I think you're missing the whole point of a good piece of knowledge."
91,84,">The problem here is the government. It does not want to make the same threats over and over, it wants to make them think that it's a symptom of a more serious problem, but it doesn't want to be the problem at all. There is no way to stop the spread of a virus."
91,85,"I'm actually not sure what to say about the NSA. I mean, I know that I was born in the 70s so this was something that we all knew at school, but I could never say about the NSA."
91,86,Basically saying that you can't prevent the spread of a virus by putting out a mask because it's not like you can keep your eyes closed.
91,87,I've seen a few people who are using a mask. One man has an X virus and the other a non-higgins one.
100,91,"OP's post: [In the context of the discussion, it seems like there is a ""lot"" of people that think it's a great idea, even if it isn't entirely. Wearing a mask in the middle of the day, you could have a really bad time."
91,1,"I think it would be better for the NSA to do an AMA and be more naive, with less context. The NSA has also shown that they would do the same thing in a reputable way, even without having any specific motivations."
91,2,The US government is using a NSA surveillance method to try to prevent the spread of a virus.
91,8,You mean you can't keep a gun away from people who wear a mask? That's pretty much an unwritten rule. It's like using a gun to cover the eyes of an enemy.
91,9,"So, what does the NSA stand for?"
91,10,"It's not a conspiracy, the government is a conspiracy."
91,12,">The problem here is the government. It does not want to make the same threats over and over, it wants to make them think that it's a symptom of a more serious problem, but it doesn't want to be the problem at all. There is no way to stop the spread of a virus."
91,15,NSA isn't just a tool. They are a tool of the government. It isn't a joke. The government uses the NSA's surveillance methods to help prevent the spread of a virus.
91,17,I think the NSA has the right to be a factor in the problem.
91,19,"The NSA is really trying to sabotage and suppress the spread of viruses in a bunch of places. The US is the biggest terrorist organization in history. It isn't a conspiracy, it's a reversal of the time. The government is trying to prevent viruses from getting to other places."
91,22,"''The problem here is the government. It does not want to make the same threats over and over, it wants to make them think that it's a symptom of a more serious problem, but it doesn't want to be the problem at all."

91,25,It sounds like the guy is an old CIA agent.
91,30,What the NSA is doing is a horrible idea.
91,36,"if someone is infected by a virus, why are they so concerned about the safety of everyone in the world? I'd consider a mask on the sidewalk or in a public area and make it a point to wear one as soon as possible"
91,42,"I know many of the stuff you've written but I know that they're saying it because ""I don't think you are going to come across as a python. You need to really think about why you need to put out a mask to stop the spread of a virus."""
91,43,a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. The quote from the article is actually actually a part of how the NSA is using the NSA's surveillance method.
91,47,"I would never put a mask on in public for anyone I was in the NSA with, and if that were the case, I would be a little embarrassed for not having said it, but it makes me really think that my life is good. My work and my friends go through the same, sadly. That I need to be in front of a wall, and at the same time, I'm getting in front of a TV screen."
91,49,I want to add that the article is not the actual part about the NSA and that the government is making it work. So what I said is that the idea of putting out a mask is a really good one.
91,51,"It's very important to remember that the NSA has an agenda to disenfranchise people. The government isn't interested in getting them to help you with the virus. I haven't heard the NSA saying that it's possible to stop the spread of the virus. The NSA is concerned with how its working to spread the virus.
