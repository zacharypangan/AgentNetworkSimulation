74,70,this month i personally know people that have gotten covid one of them past away this week please wear a mask
85,70,a special shout out goes to mr londono and ms latorre we loved the teachable moment of mask wearing and addressing covid questions also a very happy birthday to our vebbulldog jamya
92,70,i m so sorry mark but i don t trust this vaccine i understand your concern for the residents of erie county i obey the mask mandate wash and sterilize my hands when returning home from work and elsewhere
100,70,really interesting in light of people s resistance to wear a mask both the mask and the shopping cart are measurements of empathy

70,7,"I just thought they would be cool with a mask as long as you've been in the ER and you wear a mask in a pinch. That's the problem, not the mask."
70,15,"The U.S. government has a policy that they should wear a mask when traveling – it's used in the first place to protect people from the bacterial infection, but not in the first place."

70,68,It's like a CDC thing.
70,69,"Isn't it even remotely possible to wear a mask in the US? If so, the CDC is going to stop the spread of the virus."
74,70,"That’s really pretty crazy. I’m actually a bit of a vebbulldog, so i’m definitely going to wear a mask."

70,4,"A mask is not a health care system, it is not an emergency medical system. We should wear a mask in every emergency, and the CDC will not put any laws in place that prevent a virus from spreading. The CDC can't make it a ""must be vaccinated"" policy. They can make it a ""must be vaccinated"" policy, but that's not the policy here."

70,15,"So I think it's a bit pathetic to think that the government should require people to wear masks in any way if they need to prevent spread of a virus. If a person didn't have their hands sterilized and put on a mask, then the government should have gotten the best of both worlds - a lot of the time you can't just take a mask to prevent the spread of a virus."
70,24,"I don't know if it's as effective as a CDC thing, but I've worked in a hospital for 4 years. It took a lot of effort to change a mask."
70,48,I can confirm this is also one of the asian countries I have visited with our workers. I live in a cdc airfield and every time we use the airports to control the spread of a virus it's mandatory and you can't wear a mask because you can't vaccinate people. We need to vaccinate people.
70,59,"It is almost like a CDC thing. If you wear a mask, it is likely to spread the virus from other parts of the world."

70,66,"That's pretty crazy. I'm actually a bit of a vebbulldog, so i’m definitely going to wear a mask."
70,68,"I'd say the problem is that if the government has a policy to prevent the spread of a virus (and I think it does, and it has a policy to help prevent it) then it's unlikely that the government will care about stopping the spread of the virus."

101,70,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
70,3,You've got a lot of choices.
70,4,"I'm sure that if people don't like the CDC's plan to help vaccinate people who would do so, and they want to prevent that, they will not."
70,7,"I think the most important thing to remember here is that it doesn't'stop' the spread of a virus. If the government does, then it won't stop it. Vaccines are not mandatory."
70,15,"I like this meme so much that I don't even know if it was about me being covid but just a bit uncomfortable as the fact it makes me feel better. That’s really pretty crazy. I’m actually a bit of a vebbulldog, so i’m definitely going to wear a mask."
70,24,"In the US, the federal government is responsible for preventing or preventing the spread of any virus."
70,48,"In other news, it is more likely that people will be more resistant to the vaccine as they can be more resistant to it. That means that the government will be more aggressive and will be more apt to help with this vaccine than the people who aren't in the US."
70,59,"> We should wear a mask in every emergency, and the CDC can't make it a ""must be vaccinated"" policy. They can make it a ""must be vaccinated"" policy, but that's not the policy here."
70,60,"I’m going to say what’s interesting is that the CDC is going to put a policy into effect immediately, as the government is supposed to stop the spread of a virus."
70,66,"Vaccines are not mandatory in many countries, but some will even have them."
70,68,"You're saying that the CDC is trying to help the CDC keep up with the health care needs of the country. That's pathetic, too."
70,69,I like this meme so much that I don't even know if it was about me being covid but just a bit uncomfortable as the fact it makes me feel better.
74,70,What's your name? This is a little too obvious to say. I don't think I can help you at all.
85,70,"If we could wear the mask on our kids they would know, and would know if it's a bad thing. But they're so smart that they don't want to be in the same situation as us, and it's a bad idea for them."
92,70,"The film does not include a warning on the public safety camera, and is written with a specific reference to the disease. The vaccine may contain the virus, but it is not the same as the one used."
100,70,It is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
101,70,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
70,3,You sound like the kind of guy that will be trying to give your kids a better understanding of what a virus is and how it is spread. The CDC is ignoring this and not taking action.
70,4,My name is Kate. What are you going to do with the mask? I have to get it off now.
70,7,"We should wear a mask in every emergency, and the CDC can't make it a ""must be vaccinated"" policy."
70,15,This is a shame. I don’t care about people or their privacy. The government has no right to regulate the public health system.
70,24,This is why I work in healthcare at a hospital. We need to work together as a team to improve public health. I work on health teams to improve the quality of our work and we need to work with our volunteers to be able to help.
70,48,"So, you just read the article and said that he is trying to stop the spread of a virus and he hasn't gotten the message yet. I think he's actually saying that he's actually trying to stop the spread of a virus. Specifically, he hasn't actually been doing the cdc or the government to stop the spread of a virus and that they need to get it out of the country."
70,59,">we should wear a mask in every emergency, and the CDC can't make it a ""must be vaccinated"" policy. They can make it a ""must be vaccinated"" policy, but that's not the policy here."
70,60,"I want to go to the CDC to prevent this from happening again, but it's going to be crazy, but it's gonna change and it'll be a big step."
70,66,"You gotta work a lot. If you want to get sick without a mask and there is no vaccination, you need to use a mask and have a mask on."
70,68,"> We should wear a mask in every emergency, and the CDC can't make it a ""must be vaccinated"" policy. They can make it a ""must be vaccinated"" policy, but that's not the policy here."
70,69,So you have a few choices here. One is to make a mask and the other to wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus.
74,70,"So you don’t like the notion of “It’s funny how you wear a mask, but... I don’t like wearing a mask in public. But that’s a shame. But I can relate a bit to these memes."
85,70,"I've got a vebb and I don't wear a mask on my birthday, because I don't want a big tummy to see me around, and because of my skin, and my hair. I don't know what it feels like to be around someone without their dog, but if I did, I'd know what's the problem."
92,70,There's a reason people hate this vaccine...
100,70,"In my country, I have a python mask."
101,70,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
70,3,"And then they get the ""it's a shame"" memo. They're not doing anything unless there's some kind of mandate."
70,4,It's just an idea that I have no interest in going to the CDC and they're not going to get involved with it.
70,7,"I know that people think vaccinating your pets will make you sick. I wouldn't want my kids to get ill without a mask and I wouldn't want to feel bad for their privacy. So what is your job, Kate? You're the kind of person who doesn't want to be around other people and you have to go to the CDC to help them, you're a veb. You need to take care of your children."
70,15,"So your doctor is giving you a headache, not knowing if you're infected with a virus or if it's just one bad virus, then you're infected?"
70,24,">Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.If we could wear the mask on our kids they would know, and would know if it's a bad thing. But they're so smart that they don't want to be in the same situation as us, and it's a bad idea for them."
70,48,"We have a rule that says the public is required to wear a mask to stop this. That's an idiotic rule, because they have no other right to do so. So what are you going to do with the mask?"
70,59,I do not care what your kids wear but it’s a shame.
70,60,It's funny you say that but he's trying to stop the spread of a virus.
70,66,"I don't like a vebb and I don't wear a mask on my birthday, because I don't want a big tummy to see me around, and because of my skin, and my hair."
70,68,">We should wear a mask in every emergency, and the CDC can't make it a ""must be vaccinated"" policy. They can make it a ""must be vaccinated"" policy, but that's not the policy here. So you have a few choices here."
70,69,"So I have to get a mask. But I don’t want to be around people without their dog, but if I did, I’d have a very easy time knowing what’s the problem."
74,70,"It's a pity if it's a joke, but it's kinda creepy."
85,70,I'm an expert on the subject of masks and I've met people who say the same things. They're also very good at explaining things to us as a person.
92,70,So you're assuming that a number of people in this sub aren't saying the same things.
100,70,"I don't think it's so weird to think people actually wear masks. I don't know a lot about these things. It's more like saying, ""If you get sick you will be infected."" People with a mask have no idea what a python is. They wear a mask because they have no idea what a python is. They have no idea what a python is. They have no idea what a python is. I think this is what people say."
101,70,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
70,3,">We should wear a mask in every emergency, and the CDC can't make it a ""must be vaccinated"" policy."

70,7,"You mean ""so how do we prevent people from getting infected with a virus?"""
70,15,A person with a python mask probably doesn't know what a virus is.
70,24,I wouldn't wear a mask on my birthday.
70,48,They're not trying to stop the spread of a virus. They're trying to stop the spread of a virus.
70,59,The people who do not want to be in the same situation as you do not like wearing a mask and you do not like the CDC have a right to make that policy and it doesn't matter.
70,60,People with a mask have no idea what a python is. They wear a mask because they have no idea what a python is. They have no idea what a python is. They have no idea what a python is. They have no idea what a python is. They have no idea what a python is.

70,68,">We have a rule that says the public is required to wear a mask to stop this. That's an idiotic rule, because they have no other right to do so. So what are you going to do with the mask?"
70,69,"As long as it's not the CDC doing anything to stop the spread of the virus, you are safe. The CDC doesn't really know what a mask is. But at least the CDC can be very quick to put a stop to it because of what is actually going on with their office, not what's going on with the health department. I wouldn't worry about the safety, just do whatever it takes to keep your mouth shut."
74,70,You guys - if you have a very high understanding of the concept of a mask- have a frank conversation.
85,70,"> It's not that you didn't care about your husband's dog's health and it's not that you don't want your own. It's not the truth. In order to avoid spreading the virus I have to wear a mask at least once a week, or once a month (at least once a month). If your dog has a small belly and is unable to walk without a mask, it’s probably more likely that you’ll break it and go to a doctor."
92,70,"I have a phobia about the word ""snoop"" as it relates to a lot of things. I'm pretty sure I don't really like a lot of people on the internet who like to snoop and the guy I actually snooped on has mental health issues. Apparently the vaccine is a vaccine which isn't much better. The underlying issue is that a person is being manipulated and if they don't believe it then they will continue using it."

70,3,>We have a rule that says the public is required to wear a mask to stop this.
70,4,I don't think it's weird at all to think people actually wear a mask in emergency situations. The government isn't doing much to prevent the spread of the virus.
70,7,'If you get sick you will be infected.'
70,15,This is what the CDC and CDC should be doing with the vaccination program.

70,48,">We should wear a mask in every emergency, and the CDC can't make it a ""must be vaccinated"" policy."
70,59,So... we need to wear a mask to prevent people from getting infected with a virus. It's not a good idea to be able to have a python that's in a python.
70,60,"I don't like wearing a mask, I don't want people to think I'm a zombie. I think I'd rather just be in a wheelchair than a mask."
70,66,"The CDC should make it a ""must be vaccinated"" policy."
70,68,"That's kinda what the CDC says. And if you get sick from a virus then the CDC is trying to help keep up with the government's health care needs of the country. That's not the policy here. Rather than making the CDC a mandatory insurance agent it's more like "" If you get sick from a virus you will be infected."""
70,69,"My mom got me a mask for her birthday and we went outside and were all about it. She snooped on it with her dog while he was in the hospital. They thought I was funny, she thought I was weird and she told me that I didn't know what a python was. She just started talking about the pythons and was like ""hey, are we going to put our pythons in a mask?"" Then they said it's funny that I would tell everyone she was a bit upset. She"
74,70,"I'm a veb bulldog, and I like the concept. But I don't like wearing a mask, nor the idea of it being a joke, or a joke."

92,70,"...but instead of going to see it, they want the public to know about it. I guess I am gonna take a long, hard hard look at it because it is actually pretty great, but the point being is that it makes the vaccine seem less harmful, and I was really wishing it would have helped me so much. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, and I'm sorry I can't even comprehend that I have an answer to that question."
100,70,"I think it's a really weird thing to do. I think it's a really weird thing to do. I think the biggest problem with wearing a mask is that it doesn't really address the issue that is spreading. There isn't a big difference between wearing a mask in the middle of the day, you could have a really bad time. In the case of the virus, if you were to wear a mask in the middle of the day, you could have a really bad time."
