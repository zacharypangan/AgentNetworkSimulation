101,29,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
35,29,"I work in the U.S. military, and this is about what it's like to be a a prick in the military, not the federal government."
41,29,"It isn't a conspiracy theory, it is a legitimate fear and it is a right to the medical community to be careful and to not have your face exposed to the public."
50,29,"It's not necessary, it's not necessary."
60,29,"You need to wear a mask if you think it's harmful, but it's necessary and necessary."
77,29,I love running. I run for a living on a daily basis and a mask is my life.
81,29,I think wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
101,29,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
35,29,No I'm not being a jerk. I'm a nurse and I don't really want to be with people who think that they have a right to wear a mask.
41,29,It's a shame that the government won't tell people they are wrong for doing something they don't know about. It's just wrong. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
50,29,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
60,29,I hate to be a dick but people here seem to have a bad sense of humor...
77,29,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.really interesting in light of people s resistance to wear a mask both the mask and the shopping cart are measurements of empathy really interesting in light of people s resistance to wear a mask both the mask and the shopping cart are measurements of empathy
81,29,"That's actually pretty good, because the real question here is: what makes the government really want to make the government protect people."
101,29,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
35,29,"The government is making an effort to stop spread of a virus, while making it a problem. If it doesn't work as intended, then what do you expect?"
41,29,"""It isn't a conspiracy theory, it is a legitimate fear and it is a right to the medical community to be careful and not have your face exposed to the public."""
50,29,I'm an American. What a man. I wear a mask in my house when I go outside. It makes me feel like I'm on the right track.
60,29,"I like this, but I think this might sound like a gimmick..."
77,29,"My wife and I went to the grocery store, went to a doctor and the doctor was very rude and apologetic. He said they had a good reason to wear the mask so I was like Oh yeah I can wear a mask and be nice to you! But my friend still hid in a pj and he took it out and told me he loved him. I told him he wore the mask and he got upset, and was like ""I didn't think it was a lie"" so I knew it was a lie."
81,29,Wearing a mask helps stop the spread of a virus.
101,29,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
35,29,What a dick. This is the exact same thing that makes me think of all the government programs that were started by the president a few years ago.
41,29,Well... that would be a lot of problems if people had the freedom to wear a mask.
50,29,"Wearing a mask makes you feel like you're on the right track. It's a nice way to let people know that they don't think it's a big deal and that they don't want to be vaccinated. That is, if they think it's a big deal and they don't want to be vaccinated, they don't want to be vaccinated."
60,29,Is there any question to the 'avoid' part about how people think that wearing a mask is not helping the spread of a virus?
77,29,"It's not a good idea to run a marathon. It's not like it's to keep someone able to go to work on the weekend or something like that. Its not a good idea to run a marathon or go to the races. If he gets attacked by a superspy, he'll wear a mask. Its not like it's to keep someone able to go to the races. Its not a good idea to run a marathon or go to the races."
81,29,"Yes, it is a valid question."
101,29,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
35,29,"""This is a very inflammatory, not racist, non-sexist joke. I mean I wouldn't call my job because I'm in the military. I'd say it's part of what they do to prevent the spread of a virus. If it doesn't work as intended, then what do you expect?"", ""What a dick. This is the exact same thing that makes me think of all the government programs that were started by the president a few years ago."
41,29,Vaccination is about prevention. We need to be more proactive about preventative health.
50,29,It’s a nice way to let people know that they don’t think it’s a big deal and that they don’t want to be vaccinated.
60,29,"It doesn't look like an innate ability to care for an infection, just a need to do a job that is in a tight setting. You can wear a mask, and no matter what you want, the way you want it to be is in a tight setting. A mask that's actually not a mask will not prevent a disease. It's a way to help protect you against a disease. It's all part of a health care system, you can choose the kind of mask that you can wear. There is a lot of them in public,"
77,29,"That's actually pretty awesome. If I'm running, I'm going to wear a mask. My friend does. But he has to sneeze at me he needs to go to work. He also needs to wear a mask and wear a hat. He needs to wear it."
81,29,I slapped this shit on my partner.

41,29,"People don't wear masks because they don't want to infect their kids. They're just insecure, emaciated, and just as disgusting as you'd think."
50,29,I don't think this is a great use of words. There's not much we can do. The 'good' part is that they make everyone feel like they're on the right track. We're trying to make people feel better but we're not.
60,29,"They're in the US gov't but it's not in any way necessary for people to put on a mask. People can wear any sort of mask. And you can wear any kind of mask you want. You can wear whatever mask you want, so I can be pretty sure people who don't wear a mask will not think of it as a 'failure' unless they are vaccinated."
77,29,"It seems like a lot of people are trying to push the idea of people wearing masks and it's like people are talking about people who aren't in a position to use it. In any case, it would have to be a big deal to keep everyone from having a problem with something if people don't know what is going on in the world. So, what you just described sounds a little bit like a ""nanny situation"". You sound a lot more like an inexperienced guy."
81,29,"I don't think the government is going to make it like this. I think a mask is a very limiting and ineffective tool that a lot of people are unwilling to use for the purpose of protecting themselves. Besides, I don't think the CDC should have to enforce it unless it has to."
101,29,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
35,29,">""I'm just curious: In the last two paragraphs the CDC's jokes that they use to enrage and devastate people on the internet have actually been very effective. They are not going to change the policy and in that case they will."
41,29,"""... We all should wear masks. I think it's more of a matter of reaffirming the morality of the government's role as a body, not just on people's actions."""
50,29,"This isn't even a joke. This is a political joke, that is an actual joke, which is really bad and doesn't matter as much."
60,29,I don't understand why people think of wearing a mask as a way to help stop a virus.
77,29,"...because a prank is not a prank, it's just a prank."
81,29,"""We do not wear a mask on my birthday, because I don't feel like my vebb would be in a place of comfort or safety. There is a lot to say here, and there are people who actually believe that it's dangerous for their dogs."
101,29,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
35,29,"They're making a point that if you don't want to be with the people who think that they have a right to wear a mask, you will."
41,29,Vaccination is a good and effective tool. You need to wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus. Vaccination is a good and effective tool for stopping the spread of a virus.
50,29,"I think the big deal with that is the lack of a ""tainted"" mask (which has been removed by the government) in order to prevent the spread of the virus."
60,29,"You don't think that they're trying to stop a virus? They're merely trying to tell you about it, as they were told."
77,29,It was a prank that my friend told me about...
81,29,"I see the joke and thought ""Wait-you have a mask on your birthday and that you're not a joke"" and thought ""You can do this"" on your birthday, but this is a joke and is too easy."
101,29,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
35,29,"In Texas, we can't wear a mask unless you have a helmet, you are allowed to wear yours."
41,29,There's a subreddit for anti-trolls who would do the same thing.
50,29,The word mask was used by the government for a period of time before the spread of the virus.
60,29,There's not much you can do about it.
77,29,"I think I understand why you are trying to talk to me a little bit more. I mean, they're not a prank, they're a joke, you have no idea what a prank is. But they do have a right to a prank. They're not saying this is a prank, but they're being a prank. I have no idea what the problem is."
81,29,It doesn't seem to fit the article.
101,29,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
35,29,"In Texas, we can't wear a mask unless you have a helmet, you are allowed to wear yours."
41,29,"You can't say ""I don't care that you didn't... If they are wearing a mask, they are not going to help anyone."""
50,29,"Is your wife a big fan of ""fantastic""?"
60,29,"I think the point of this sub is that when you ask a question you are getting answers. You have an answer that goes, ""How do I know you think this is a joke?"" And not just any joke."
77,29,"The best way to make a prank is to put it on. In the article, if you want to make a prank, you need to get some of the things in that article - but it's really not a prank. If you have the right to do a prank, don't do it."
81,29,"What you're saying is if you're not going to be a cynic, that's not a good idea. I don't think it's that hard to make a joke out of this."
