87,22,"This is a common rooster apology that you'll always get from someone with autism and this is the only one who's not very fluent. That's why everyone knows, they want to know how to deal with this."
90,22,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
91,22,This is why I like the first line.
100,22,"It sounds like people want to make a change. If it doesn't work, they have a mask to wear."
22,13,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
26,22,"Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of a virus, it's useless and I hate it."
31,22,i m a nurse and I don t want to be a jerk about a topic like this.
52,22,The article was written by one of the people who said they were vaccinated. He explains the issue.
61,22,I think this is the case that everyone knows there's a problem and it's a great way to help them.
64,22,"I mean, it's like the 'Mask' and the 'Machine' meme, if you're going to use that phrase to try and explain the concept."
83,22,"In addition to this statement, I'm saying that a person has every right to a free mask, but the public has the right to decide what they want to do. And if there is a problem with a'safe' person wearing a mask, it's the public that needs to see it. It's not a policy that people must implement, and it's a law that a lot of people are unwilling to understand, and so we're going to need to stick to the public's safety."
85,22,"if she was born in 1898, the government should help her."
87,22,Are you a medical student? Because itâ€™s a major issue in the US.

91,22,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. A mask i can wear is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
100,22,People who have never heard of the ''walking mask '' and then put on a mask are actually people who had not yet seen the mask in their daily lives. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
22,13,People who have never heard of the ''walking mask '' and then put on a mask are actually people who had not yet seen the mask in their daily lives. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
26,22,I have no idea what you mean by that.
31,22,"Why are these people being jerks? I mean, that's ridiculous. But I do think the government really believes in that."
52,22,I think we're on the same page here.
61,22,You need to stop wearing a mask to get away from the fact that the government gave you a vaccine. This is where you get the opportunity to show your parents that they're happy to give you an option.
64,22,"I think it's a satire, a joke, and a lie. You didn't say what you thought. But it's true. The mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
83,22,> It's a lot like the movie. It's the fucking law in that state where you get a free mask (when you can buy one) and it's illegal.
85,22,> he was born in 1898 and has a dog named Jaad Jaad.
87,22,The fact that you are wearing a mask outside while vaccinated is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
90,22,This would be the one. I think you need to find some form of evidence that the government is working in part to stop the spread of a virus.
91,22,i would have hated to hear this on a regular basis. this isnt so easy.
100,22,"> People who don't know what a walking mask is, are really strange. I don't know what the definition of a ""walking mask"" is, but I think this is what people say. There are actually people who are so very, very strange and strange that they think they are very cool."
22,13,"If the problem isn't with a person's safety, the problem is with a person's health. Those people need to stop using their masks."
26,22,Is a good question a good question?
31,22,My father works in a hospital. He was a nurse in the hospital. He had never been in a medical emergency before. He would put on a mask to try and annoy people.
52,22,I think there's a lot more to the story than that.
61,22,>I think the real problem with wearing a mask is that it doesn't really address the issue that is spreading. I think it is more that people want to be protected from a virus.
64,22,People can be conditioned to feel they can't have a good day if they aren't doing something about it.
83,22,Is the public's right to decide what to do?
85,22,"So I want you to know why some people want you to not see a dog with a mask? I've heard it's a really fun dog and it sounds like you need a little encouragement to do the same. I mean, it sounds like a cute dog, but the other one does... it's not."
87,22,I wouldn't put my face on a mask. There are literally thousands of people in the world that are sick and don't even know how to look up and say that they're wearing masks outside.
90,22,"If you are going to do the slapstick video, read the whole book and think about how it would be fun and interesting to read."
91,22,"My father had a face mask as a kid. It was a joke, but he thought it was the best mask."
100,22,"I thought it was really weird, but this really is cool. Wearing a mask and shopping cart is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
22,13,"I have always admired how people have changed over the years. I have a mask to protect me from being killed, but that is because it can be worn to keep me from being bitten. I've seen some people with a mask before. They are also able to do things while I'm flying. They know that they are sexy, but not for a long time. That's why they put on a mask while being vaccinated. They don't think about the health of the person, that they have to change the fact that they aren'"
26,22,A good question is a good question. Does it make a good question or is it good if the answer is yes?
31,22,They're referring to the government's policy.
52,22,"This sub doesn't support the notion that they are ""just being a little bit of a dick"" because ""they think it's a big deal because they think that someone in their face would be at risk for HIV."""
61,22,I have a feeling if the government made a helmet that I would have to have had to wear because a cloak would probably be a better option. I am not a lawyer but I think a cloak would be a better choice.
64,22,"I've seen several posts about how people wear masks while working a sick job. They are called 'empathy masks' because of the way they'save' themselves. And if they're only in use a few days, that's why they are called 'empathy masks'."
83,22,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.So, if you have a fecal disease, is it possible to wear a mask on an unprotected child? Then you can be covered in a fecal infection that will be in your head for a few days. It was so bad, but not as bad. Is the public's right to decide what to do? Is it the best thing I could have done?"
85,22,"> Because I don't feel like my vebb would be in a place of comfort or safety. If I wear a mask on my birthday, I want my husband to be around, he's not my dog and I want to avoid getting sick of him in case he has a vebbb and I have problems."
87,22,"I don't think this is in any context. The point is that you should have thought that if you get sick, you'll get sick. The problem with vaccination is not that people shouldn't put their face on a mask, but that it is a way to prevent infection."
90,22,"he said he wanted to wear a mask because it was a way to hide his fear. but now that he has no idea where he is, it seems like it would be better for him to put the mask on with the e-mail that he's given out and then go with it."
91,22,This is really a great discussion.
100,22,"The fact that a man who has worn a mask and hasn't seen the mask in his daily life does not mean that he is 'cool'. There's only an issue with the perception of the people he sees in his own head, and it's not like the people who haven't seen the mask are just 'cool' because they think they are cool."
22,13,"That's just the most important part of the vaccine, but it's very simple. A mask helps fight the spread of the disease."
26,22,"That was so funny, that I wanted to laugh at this and then I realized there's no way to stop it. I didn't even try."
31,22,>They're referring to the government's policy.
52,22,"I'm afraid the word ""maske"" is pretty broad to be honest, but I'm willing to bet you that someone with HIV and a mask or an AIDS virus will not be at risk. And that's not to say the government isn't a dick."
61,22,"Is this the kind of thing where people who don't know what an HIV infection is will be offended? I don't see what a guy can't help, so I don't feel good about it."
64,22,The wording has been inconsistently misleading. It's the opposite of the phrase.
83,22,"There are still a few things you should remember from reading this article. The article says that ""wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.It doesn't matter if it's a government mandate or not. It's a part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.You're going to have to look pretty damn damn good with your doctor's help to figure out how to use a mask. The video says that because of the citations to support"
85,22,This article is full of shit and I am so sorry your husband doesn't do the right thing.
87,22,What does your friend think is the joke?
90,22,"I don't think it's a joke, it's just a bit crazy, I think the first part of this video is a complete one. I just think this is kind of funny. I do not think it's funny. The joke I think is funny is that people can be offended by that prank or they think it's a good idea. It's a prank, it's a prank, it's just that this is a prank that most people would be offended by."
91,22,The first line is the worst part. It is not about how government and private entities create and protect their own people.
100,22,"This is an apt title because the main point in this thread was that we are using ""Savage"" as a name for people who wear a mask. But since we are using ""savage"" as a term for people who are wearing a mask and don't have the knowledge to make a choice, that is not the point here. So instead, I'm saying that people who wear a mask and then put on a mask are actually people who have not yet seen the mask in their daily lives."
22,13,That's one of the reasons that he has to stop wearing it. He has to stop being in a fight with people who would like to get out of it. He is an idiot and I can't stand him in this.
26,22,"My dad had to put a mask on when I was a kid, and my mom and dad did the same thing. I never went out in public with my mom because of it, and I just thought she was pretty good. My father is a great actor. I like the fact that he's a troll."
31,22,The first part of the quote in the post is the omission of the quote. I'm pretty sure they are just going to give him a life jacket.
52,22,I wear a mask and bend my head out.
61,22,"I don't know why people are joking, but I think that the first sentence is ""I don't think it's a joke, I think it's the NSA's job to protect us from infection and he's wearing a mask."""
64,22,This is the exact type of mask that makes the virus go away?
83,22,It's a part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
85,22,You are being a man of your word. You need to be honest with your husband.
87,22,"I'm a doctor. I'm a nurse. I am a dr and it seems like I'm getting sick all the time. I'm also vaccinated against a virus and we have been vaccinated to prevent it from spreading. This is a joke and it's not a joke. It's a joke. This joke is all a joke. But, he is a troll."
90,22,I think if they said a prank on a prank and then started trying to use a different name to make the rehash of the word route that might be a joke then it's a joke.
91,22,"''The problem here is the government. It does not want to make the same threats over and over, it wants to make them think that it's a symptom of a more serious problem, but it doesn't want to be the problem at all."
100,22,I'm so sorry but it's been 2 months since I wore a syphilis mask...
22,13,It's just a prank on his health. Not a joke. ''The joke I think is funny is that people can be offended by that prank or they think it's a good idea.
26,22,">A person who wears a mask outside is a python, not a python. I don't think it's a good idea to do vaccination. I think it's a better idea to get it done."
31,22,"In the world of health care, it is mandatory that people get vaccinated."
52,22,"Wearing a mask and bend your head out. You need to be brave. The world is going to end in a few days. I've just been vaccinated with the AIDS virus. Wearing a mask outside while vaccinated is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. The whole thing is not ""complaining and being dicks and wearing a mask and wearing a mask and wearing a mask and wearing a mask and wearing a mask and wearing a mask and wearing a mask and"
61,22,I like wearing a mask to stop spreading the virus. I like wearing a mask to get away from the fact that the government gave me a vaccine.
64,22,It was not a joke.
83,22,"The article says that ""Women who want to protect themselves from getting sick have every right to a free mask, but the public has the right to decide what they want to do."", """
85,22,There's a reason why most people hate the NSA. It doesn't make them feel a certain way.
87,22,"Vaccines are still a huge issue with most doctors, but they're not mandated."
90,22,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
91,22,Is this really something you're looking for? What else are you talking about?
100,22,"I feel like this is the next episode of the ""What are we really talking about?"" series of movies."
22,13,"Vaccines are still a huge issue with most doctors, but they're not mandated. Wearing a mask while being vaccinated is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
26,22,"I don't think we're seeing a big problem here. Vaccination does not work, but it isn't a prank."
31,22,"This is a really great post, but I think there is some really useful information here. One thing that comes to mind is that a virus is not really a virus. Vaccination is used as a form of protection against most of those. There is also a big reason why people are so critical to peoples health and safety in many countries."
52,22,"The joke is, ""I'm gonna say, I don't like this. I know a lot of people who think wearing a mask is a great idea, but in my opinion I don't think the NSA understands the issue. I've gotta be honest."
61,22,"> I think the real problem with wearing a mask is that it doesn't really address the issue that is spreading. I think it is more that people want to be protected from infection. I think it is more that people want to be protected from a virus."""
64,22,I'm sure the NSA isn't doing it's job. There's no reason they should stop the fucking.
83,22,People who want to wear a mask can wear one without a mask because they feel uncomfortable. Is that what you are saying a tv show you aren't going to be interested in?
85,22,"> ""Wearing a mask doesn't help stop the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask doesn't help stopping the spread of a virus.idk how the NSA works or what it does not do, but in addition it makes your life much harder and the government will continue to work on a lot of different things."""
87,22,You're right. This is a troll.
90,22,What's it that makes you want to run a prank?
91,22,"I've been exposed to the spread of AIDS, I am not even sure where I can live without wearing a mask. I think I should make sure I'm safe, though."
100,22,"I believe ""if you get sick you will be infected."""
22,13,The point of this article is to suggest that people aren't necessarily immune to any form of health risks. The article is not about that.
26,22,"I would love for people who wear a mask to know what's up, but not a good prank or a good joke."
31,22,"I'm just trying to get a little more clear - there is a bit of an 'I'm really mad at this prank.' I'm not even sure why people are putting off this joke, I just want a bit more information, I don't think I'd make a joke about this, because I've learned to talk with my parents and their parents about it."
52,22,The part where people wear a mask in the face of a virus they are trying to protect themselves.
61,22,The NSA has been known to use the CDC as a propaganda tool to protect children from HIV. It's no wonder people are so terrified of the CDC.
64,22,"My bf wore a mask when he was sick. He went to work when he was sick. He came home in the middle of the night because he had a fever, but when he did he had a nosebleed. He wore a mask because he was sick, because his nose was on his nose, because the nose was in my mouth. And then he was in the hospital in the middle of the night and he got his nose sucked in a big blowjob. He actually has a nosebleed, but he tries to"
83,22,The federal government is a giant piece of shit.
85,22,"I don't understand why you're so inflammatory about your post. I mean, I have no idea how a lot of people can be so cynical about the NSA but I'm trying to tell my wife that the NSA is not a government agency. Then they try to'repress' the NSA's power, and it works out really well."
87,22,No. This is the only reason you can't have fun.
90,22,I'd suggest you watch the video OP wrote and explain that:
91,22, (Citizen: /oldest_in_happiness/.) (https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/posts/2009/06/2/The-Dissistance-Band-Proved-Suppression)
100,22,It was a great episode. I feel like a lot of people on a motorcycle in the 80's just started doing this and there are so many people that are genuinely really interested.
