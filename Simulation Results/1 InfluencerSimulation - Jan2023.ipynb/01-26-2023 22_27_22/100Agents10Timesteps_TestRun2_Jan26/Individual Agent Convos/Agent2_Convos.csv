101,2,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
10,2,They want everyone to wear their own mask and then they have a few weeks to vaccinate everyone with a new one.
16,2,If a hat is too much for you i m glad that i m not the only one who thinks this.
20,2,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
23,2,"We should go to the CDC and go over what happened to dnald trump at 11, he was wearing a mask and I would like to do so."

38,2,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
41,2,yea and it's not like they're doing it because they're a lot of fun
44,2,The fact that a person is attempting to prevent a virus is a sign of that.
75,2,"Wearing a mask helps prevent the spread of the virus, but at the same time, it will reduce your vulnerability to the virus if it lingers. I know a couple years ago that the government was concerned for those who did not want to run."
77,2,"Yes, a man would love to come run with me and it will be a nice day to have a group of strangers for a second"
79,2,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
91,2,>We are wearing a mask to prevent the spread of the virus
101,2,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
10,2,I do not think anyone has to worry about the mask in their face. It's just as easy to wear as a mask.
16,2,I would like to suggest that you go with an AIDS/AIDS mask and a t-shirt.
20,2,"This isn't even true. The CDC isn't a vaccine for the 'Sepsis', and a health care agency is putting a'sensitization' program into place for the victims."
23,2,I'm trying to explain why people aren't using masks.
34,2,>As encouraging as this news is please remember that this new cdc guideline still calls for wearing masks in federal facilities including airports mask wearing vaccinated or not is still required at syr and all u s airports
38,2,"I don't see how that makes sense. He may think he's making the right choices because it's important for his government to provide basic safety for people. I think you're right that it's important, but I feel like there are a lot of people in the health care system who have to do this."
41,2,They're also a threat to the security of the community.
44,2,I believe they are trying to make people wear masks for some reason. It is not their job to prevent a virus. They are trying to make people wear masks for the same reason.
75,2,Vaccination is about prevention. We need to be more proactive about preventative health.
77,2,The most important part of what I am saying is:
79,2,This isn't the new national holiday. It's a celebration of freedom.
91,2,It is the anti - health insurance scam. The anti - anti - HIV scam is a way to go.
101,2,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
10,2,I have never heard of the word'masked' in the dictionary. I do see it as the same for the rest of my life.
16,2,That is a joke about being too scared to wear a mask.
20,2,"I also don't think people would ever be able to use the words ""medical mask"" or ""medical mask"". This seems to me to be a pretty ambiguous post."
23,2,The mask isn't just used for a vaccination.
34,2,"It was a cdc memo that they have on hand. If I were in the U.S., I would wear a mask because I had a vaccinated, vaccinated, vaccinated person in my family."
38,2,he's a dick faced person. I'm not even a fan of him. I'm not even a fan of him.
41,2,"I was a little confused about the ""Santa wears a mask"" part."
44,2,"I am very very, very concerned with this and I am so sorry, my apologies, for being so rude and naive and so unresponsive to you. I am trying to stop the spread of this disease."
75,2,The definition of a 'pants at the party' is the same as 'preventative health'. That's not an option.
77,2,It's a shame to scoff at people who don't like to be treated like that.
79,2,I'm a Republican and I'm a Republican.
91,2,"As someone who's had a family who carries a mask since I was in school, I know this phrase - ""... I can only imagine how much this person will resent my shit in front of all the people that are just playing paintball!"""
101,2,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
10,2,You're only going to need one if you're a professional HIV/AIDS patient.
16,2,That is an awful joke about being too scared to wear a mask.
20,2,It's a joke.
23,2,This movie seems so much like a bad idea. You're not in a good place.
34,2,"We need a vaccine to stop the spread of viruses, right?"
38,2,You know you don't want to keep yourself at risk for papilloma?
41,2,">We all should wear masks. I think it's more of a matter of reaffirming the morality of the government's role as a body, not just on people's actions."
44,2,That's why I say you don't want to be on a roll.
75,2,"If the government wants to stop the spread of a virus, it needs to have a policy on how to protect the population."
77,2,"I'm very sorry for your loss. My husband and I are very sorry that your friend is sick, but I know this is a really difficult situation."
79,2,"A few things. 1. a mask, not a mask. 2. a mask is a mask. 4. a mask is a mask. 5. a mask is a mask. 7. a mask. 6. a mask. 7. A mask. 8. A mask. 7. A mask. 10. A mask. 9. A mask. 10. A mask. 10.

91,2,"That's a great quote, it doesn't sound like it really means anything."
101,2,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
10,2,I read a report that the government is trying to prevent the spread of a virus. I really think the government is able to stop this issue. It is a good one.
16,2,I don't understand why people don't wear a mask. People seem to like wearing a mask and not want to think about how nice it is for their health. There's a funny thing I learned from this story in a scavenger hunt. I like wearing a mask because I can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows i like wearing a mask because i can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows i like wearing a mask because i can go out in public with a fat lip in and
20,2,This is a joke. It's not a joke. I've seen that.
23,2,"[I think it's a good idea. People like me are in the minority, but I do not have a right to wear a... but the best one is to wear a face mask. In my opinion, the public needs to be better aware of what the people who play paintball like wear."
34,2,"We need a vaccine to stop the spread of viruses, right?"
38,2,"I know what you mean, but I can't say for sure what the answer is: ""I feel like there are a lot of people in the health care system who have to do this."" (I can't imagine how they can be putting so much pressure on the mother, and she's being very jaded about him. ) Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
41,2,Vaccination is about prevention. We need to be more proactive about preventative health.
44,2,"I am a woman, I am so sorry that you need to get an eviction."
75,2,I believe that this has nothing to do with the government being incompatible with something.
77,2,"It's kinda cool to think this was just a nanny situation, but I guess that's how you would imagine people with HIV are treated. I do believe that the best way to protect the people is to put them in a hive mind and talk to them about what they want."
79,2,"> ""Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. "","
91,2,"There is a huge difference between ""I am trying to help a little bit"" and ""I can only imagine how much this person will resent my shit in front of all the people that are just playing paintball!""."
101,2,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
10,2,"A lot of the people in this thread are gonna tell you the facts about why the government is being the biggest one. It isn't a good idea, it just isn't a good way to prevent the spread of the virus."
16,2,[Assuming that's what they are saying](http://www.theron.com/articles/agg/2014/04/reg/viral_replication_issue_with_a-mask_in_france.html).
20,2,Isn't a mask a form of a mask?
23,2,"""[I think it's a good idea. People like me are in the minority, but I do not have a right to wear a... but the best one is to wear a face mask."""
34,2,"If a person was a CDC Specialist and had a CDC infection, he would have been vaccinated and his husband would have had the same situation. But since this was an actual CDC memo from the early 1990s, that's just a guess."
38,2,I think a lot of people in the health care system who don't get a vaccine wear one. That's part of the joke.
41,2,"""...We all should wear masks. I think it's more of a matter of reaffirming the morality of the government's role as a body, not just on people's actions."""
44,2,I haven't read that in years...
75,2,"A lot of people with papilloma will take their masks off at a party, but this is a very general case of ""why is it the worst thing that the government could do"" and they will be all ""no masks."" I am very sorry, but I can't agree with you more than that, because the government isn't incompatible with what they say."
77,2,Nope. You say it all over the Internet. What the fuck?
79,2,It's not legal to wear a mask all the time. It's not like that is the case.
91,2,Is this the kind of person who can be the most effective anti-viral. They're trying to create a social environment where we can all be the better people we can be.
101,2,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
10,2,I don't know who this is.
16,2,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I would go on a date with you to tell you I was a Veb and I can't be here to help you. That's pretty stupid. Yes, he is wrong and is being an idiot to his vebb despite being a big nut."
20,2,A prankster? Not really a joke. A prankster??
23,2,Why does the CIA use the NSA's surveillance method? They are using the NSA and not the government.
34,2,">I don't think he knows what it is, so it's a very dumb joke."
38,2,I am a HUGE fan of the vaccine.
41,2,"Well, I don't think I was able to get a good look at the whole thing. It was a great movie."
44,2,"So what does everyone in the world do if they have a slapstick meme? It's funny and not only fucking funny. It's the most offensive thing on Earth, and yet people seem to think its really funny."
75,2,I don't get it. I don't think people wear a mask when their parents are going to a party. I think they think that's weird.
77,2,"I think it's really strange that the word ""prank"" is so used here."
79,2,"That's the joke, right? I don't see how this is a big problem. I think it's not just a joke, it's a joke."
91,2,The US government is using a NSA surveillance method to try to prevent the spread of a virus.
101,2,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
10,2,I do not think it is the best idea to have a mask. That's exactly what the government is trying to prevent. And it's not a prank to make people wear a mask.
16,2,"[[Missions in public (shaming) and deceit are not mutually exclusive, and have specific uses, if any], and all of this is a form of slander and delusion."
20,2,I'm a little confused.
23,2,"""We should go to the CDC and go over what happened to dnald trump at 11, he was wearing a mask and I would like to do so.''"
34,2,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
38,2,"I'm sorry but I can't say for sure what the answer is: ""I feel like there are a lot of people in the health care system who have to do this."""
41,2,"Is it necessary for you to wear a mask? I don't want to wear a mask, but I want you to wear a mask."
44,2,It's really funny and hilarious. You have a legitimate argument about'slapstick memes' and you don't need to argue with the government.
75,2,"The question is why is this a prank? Because it's an ill thought out thing, not a prank."
77,2,The joke's part of the prank.
79,2,"The people who complain about this are the people who complain about this being a joke, and the people who complain about it being an issue."
91,2,I'm going to say that we should just go to a doc about this...
101,2,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
10,2,"He had to leave because the government is trying to prevent HIV/AIDS, he needs to move on to a different job."

23,2,">I think people are overreacting. This is a rant, not a joke. What are you doing here?"
34,2,"The CDC has actually been telling us that as they get more vaccines, there will be more people infected by the virus."
38,2,'I feel like there are a lot of people in the health care system who have to do this.''
41,2,"What's more important is that we know that ""Santa is wearing a mask. Vaccination is a good and effective tool. You need to wear a mask, and you'll be wearing a mask soon."""
44,2,"What does a slapstick meme sound like? I was thinking about the joke evrytime I was in Texas. The joke was ""the mask isn't going to stop the spread of the virus."""
75,2,"I just think that when you consider your remark about a ""prank"" you utterly ignore the point of your remark. And you recite the whole fucking article because you didn't give me any answer."

91,2,"This guy is a CIA agent. He's not a terrorist. He's an old man. The NSA does not want his job to be a terrorist, he wants to be a citizen of the US, not a puppet. He's the one who is a puppet, and he wants the government to have their way."
101,2,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
10,2,It is a joke.... not a prank.
16,2,I haven't been told what a prank is in this thread. I don't think I would have to tell my husband to wear a mask.
20,2,>The medical community and the government are both trying to stop the spread of this virus. A virus is inherently dangerous and we can't prevent it.
23,2,That isn't funny. It's not funny.
34,2,"Isn't this actually about being a doctor? Because I don't think so, and I don't think it's a joke."
38,2,"[Picture of an unvaccinated person, using a mask to protect themselves](http://www.pshwc.org/docs/repair/comments/4c-08-06/vf-cg_fcs_rpg). Vaccines are a part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
41,2,"Vaccination is the best way to stop a virus. This is the way the US uses the word ""savage"" a lot. That means we need to stop the spread of a virus."
44,2,"If you're tired of saying things like ""I wear a mask when I don't have a job"" you have a phobia."
75,2,"I'm sorry, but I can't agree with you more than that, because the government isn't incompatible with something."
77,2,If this were me I'd be a bit nervous about that part of a prank.
79,2,">Wood is just a mask. I don't know how to get away from wearing a mask. But, yes, the government is basically saying you can't really have a meaningful and meaningful discussion about why the government isn't allowed to use the same amount of time and effort to try and prevent the spread of a virus."
91,2,It's so important for them to learn a new way to behave. The NSA doesn't want to spend money on anything else. The NSA is working on something. I'm an adult and I know it doesn't.
101,2,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
