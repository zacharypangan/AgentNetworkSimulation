100,73,really interesting in light of people s resistance to wear a mask both the mask and the shopping cart are measurements of empathy
101,73,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
73,6,That was pretty funny he got Covid. Didn't that have more to do with the vaccines he had to pay?
73,13,And it seems that his supporters seem to be embracing it and that the support for it and not the law or the government in general seems to be in place.
73,17,How about an organization like an anti-meat movement?
73,19,"I'm not really that involved with his efforts to enforce that mandate, but it's nice to know that he doesn't do it. His entire team is in a terrible position to do it. I am not aware of the whole thing. I just don't think he should be ashamed of it. He should be ashamed to wear a mask, not in the same sense he has to."
73,21,"Go for it, then come on and let me know how it goes. I'll be at the public park."
73,24,"Yes, it is the truth, but as you said, a statewide mask mandate is a statewide mandate."
73,27,I think it’s strange that he doesn’t even enforce that mandate. Maybe he just didn’t want to take out the mandate?
73,38,It seems to me that he is the first person person to have the dreadful attitude that the guy wants to make people happy if he is the one in charge of protecting people. So it s not surprising that he is doing things to support the people he's trying to be.
73,40,... I think you're being a very condescending and dick-faced person.
73,43,"I've noticed that when it comes to government policy, the government has a whole lot of power, but the government isn't doing anything to stop the spread of the virus. I don't know how you can do something like that."
73,48,Do you remember the one time when he came to the state to get Covid?
73,51,You're a very smart person who doesn't want to put your head down. He's going to be getting more and more hating on you if he doesn't put a hat on. That's the part that I'm most worried about.
73,57,"I feel a bit of a skepticism about Covid because he actually has a lot of venom, which isn't something I really care about at all."
73,68,"I would not wear a mask in public unless i were in a private space with people on my phone, because they may see a face mask."
74,73,My husband has a mask that he wears and he will wear it when he goes home.

91,73,"In my opinion, the public needs to be better aware of what the people who play Paintball like wear. If the government is able to stop it and isn't making the community aware of the effect, that's a big win."
99,73,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
100,73,"In this context, it seems like one of the most effective ways to protect your child from the virus is to wear a mask."

73,6,"If you're being condescending, you're getting a lot of people on reddit. I don't really care how your husband's skepticism is. I mean, he has the right to do whatever he wants, but in that case, you need to stop being condescending. You're right, it's just a skepticism, but it's really just a skepticism."
73,13,My husband is on a mask. He doesn't really have it. I'd rather not wear it.
73,17,I'm not sure why you're getting downvoted but I'm curious. You aren't talking about a statewide mask mandate.
73,19,It's hard to say what this guy is actually doing. I'm not the first person to have the dreadful attitude that he wants to make people happy if he is the one in charge of protecting people.
73,21,"I would wear a mask with the venom in it while vaccinating a child, but the government will not make his entire team aware of the effect. The first person person person, who is being an asshole, can never put a mask on."
73,24,"I see what you mean, but how do you think he is being condescending? The problem isn't that he doesn't enforce the mask mandate, but that he's doing things that will prevent it from spreading and that's really all he can do."
73,27,Is he actually the one in charge of the venom program? No. Is that what he is doing?
73,38,he's a dick-faced person. I'm not even a fan of him.
73,40,"I want to apologize for the words that I have said, but what I have not said was that he is a dickhead and I know he isn't a dickhead - but he isn't in any way a dickhead. He is not, in fact, being an impersonator."
73,43,Is this not part of the statewide mask mandate?
73,48,"I'm not sure if a lot of people actually care, or if it's just his attitude."
73,51,I think you are being a very condescending and dick-faced person. It sounds like you have a lot to hide.

73,68,No. That's not a bad thing. If the masks were to stop the spread of the virus then it'd be really hard to stop.
74,73,"That is a shame. But I can relate a bit to these memes. They are all really revealing. And I'm glad you guys got the idea for this one. But the people are also going to say that they can be uncomfortable. So don't wear a mask in public, don't talk about it, and don't think about it in real life."
81,73,"Wearing a mask at work to protect others, not yourself. That's not a nice idea. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
83,73,They also tell you that you should wear a mask after a lot of work. It's a good idea to wear a mask after work.
87,73,It's also an awful thing to do when it comes to vaccinating. I'm also a doctor and vaccinated with the AIDS virus.
91,73,"i'd rather play paintball in private rather than with someone. The most common dietary advice is to wear a mask, but the best one is to use a face mask."
99,73,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.The whole purpose of the campaign is to stop the spread of a virus and keep the public from using it in a way that would end the conflict between the two groups.

73,24,"I don't understand why it would be inappropriate to wear a mask on someone, because they aren't willing to share anything with the government. I'm going to say what's really strange is that the guy seems to think that it's an act of kindness and an act of kindness."
73,27,"There are no ""masks"" to keep out the spread of AIDS. They don't prevent it from spreading. The government can't keep them on the people."

73,57,"People in the world who aren't aware of the effects of the virus are a dickhead. There are people who wear masks and they make a lot of money, but I'd be more than happy to go and put on my mask."
73,68,"I’m the one who thinks that in a perfect world, all a dick can do is put a mask on. I think that in the world a dick can’t get on a mask that’s used to remove a virus (that makes it easier to get the virus out of your body)."
74,73,I'm a bit of a vebbulldog. And I like to wear a mask all the time. In my opinion the most interesting thing about the week is that the mask is wearing it to stop the spread of a virus.
81,73,"...and yet, she is wearing her mask on the day of her birthday, so... Wearing a mask on a run is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

83,73,>Is this part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus?
87,73,I'm a doctor who is also vaccinated with a HIV virus.

73,13,"Its not what it is, its what it is. AIDS is not an infectious disease. If there is a virus it can be spread very easily. Its because it's not a virus that's been shown to be prevalent."
73,17,"The whole problem isn't in the government's best interest, but in the people who are."
73,19,The government has to do something. Its not something that's a little dangerous or offensive. It's a government thing.
73,21,What did the article say? How many people is there to know that he's a dickhead?

73,51,I think the fact that it's a dickhead is a bad sign - people aren't going to tell him about that.
73,57,"Yes. If a mask were to stop the spread of a virus, then it would be really hard to stop. If you can't get rid of it, then there is a LOT of money that needs to be wasted, and it wouldn't go anywhere without a mask."
73,68,A man has a python that he grew up with and the government does not want to enforce.
74,73,"Is this an exaggeration? I'm actually a bit of a vebbulldog, so i'm definitely going to wear a mask. So I wear a mask every week and I can't believe I was there....and I like it, too."
81,73,"I'm a little bit saddened that people would say something like ""I can't do it because I don't know what it is to do for my family and a friend and I wear a mask on my birthday to protect myself. ""...and yet, her mother is wearing a mask on the day of her birthday, so.."" I'm a little saddened that no one would say anything and my family didn't tell me anything."
83,73,Is there any way that I can wear a mask with my eyes open?
87,73,Wearing a mask outside while vaccinated is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
91,73,"I think they would say something like ""Why's that a common misconception?"", and that they want us to do the right thing.

101,73,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
73,6,"Its not really a problem and it's not fair to be against the mandate. The AIDS CDC has made it very clear that they are working to stop the spread of the virus. It is also not a big deal. If he wasn't there to fight and fight the virus then no one would listen to him and he would be going to jail or in prison, and they would try to help the AIDS epidemic."
73,13,I've heard a couple of these people and their husband's wives say it isn't the right thing to do. The fact that they aren't aware of the problem is just another example of what might be happening.
73,17,Why would you wear a mask? It isn't a good idea to try to keep a python alive. It is just so easy to do.
73,19,"We have an extremely important issue to focus on. There's no way to say that a man who says he is good at being nice and wearing a mask in public doesn't do it.

83,73,"So, if you have a fecal disease, is it possible to wear a mask on an unprotected child? Then you can be covered in a fecal infection that will be in your head for a few days."
87,73,"The point of a rant is to tell you to keep it on. If your a doctor, and vaccinated, don't put on a mask, you're putting on a mask. If you're a doctor, and you want to stay away from the government, don't wear a mask outside while vaccinated. It's a joke and doesn't make it relevant."
91,73,"It isn't an involuntary government war, it's an involuntary one. This isn't a conspiracy or a morally correct and inexcusable conspiracy to prevent the spread of a virus. Unless your friends are in the military, then they have no duty to try to stop it."

I mean, I'm not going to get vaccinated, I have never been to a doctor, and I'm not even sure that I've ever been vaccinated by a doctor. Rather, I'm being a troll, I've been vaccinated with an actual vaccine. And to make the joke about that, I"
91,73,"I'm sure the whole thing makes me wonder about whether people should play paintball to make sure they are being protected, but they probably would not mind if they don't think they are infected."

100,73,"I think the whole ""if you get sick you will be infected."" thing just seems like a bad idea. It is not that strange and really a big deal."
101,73,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
73,6,"You're saying you think the government is inefficient, but you don't think they should be working to stop the spread of AIDS?"
73,13,">You know, what a joke. I read this and it makes sense. I'm not a fan of the government, but I think the problem isn't that it's not helping, but that it's just not the same as the disease. Apparently, the CDC has been doing the same thing with the HIV and THC treatment."
73,17,"I think it's a joke about how the government is inefficient, but the thing is not what's preventing AIDS. Its an act of kindness, but it's also a joke."
73,19,"It sounds like the person he's talking to is not a doctor. He said he'd just be a doctor, not that he's doing it."
73,21,"I'm not an advocate of AIDS, but a liar. If I were you, I'd give the CDC a visit. But I'm not a dickhead, I'm a veb."
73,24,"What's he trying to do about it? Tell him, the fact that you're a dick and you haven't been vaccinated has to do with that."
73,27,"I'm a doctor, so I think a bit of this is being a troll."
73,38,"The guy is telling a joke. He's a dick, not a joke."
73,40,You need to get tested to determine if it's a 'bug' or if you can't get the vaccinations.
73,43,"The government does not have any power to stop the spread of AIDS, and is unwilling to do anything about it. Those who do want to protect themselves don't have to wear a mask."
73,48,...I thought this was just a joke. It's not a big deal. But you're making a big point and he is being a troll about it.
73,51,"I think you are not being sarcastic. This is really a joke. It's just a joke. Basically this is what the CDC has been doing to stop the spread of AIDS. If it's something you know that you need to stop then you have to wear a mask. If the CDC is doing the same thing with the HIV treatment, you just don't know how to use a mask."
73,57,I want to know what that means.
73,68,"It sounds like he wants to do the CDC work, and that he's trying to stop AIDS. You are a dickhead, I'm also a doctor, and it sounds like he's working on a new HIV vaccine and a vebbulbdog."
74,73,"The only reason I am wearing a mask is because I know a woman who wore one for her birthday, and I didn't think she would ever wear it."
81,73,"The first part of this piece is essentially a joke - he says ""but you're not a joke. Wearing a mask on your birthday"" and it's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
83,73,">'Is this part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus?',"
87,73,I don't think he's saying that this is a joke or something if he's making it up. He's saying it because he wants to make fun of it.
91,73,I don't get how you think this whole situation is.
99,73,This is exactly what the comments and questions ask me. I don't care about what a mask is. I'm just not into wearing masks.
100,73,It's not really a big deal.
101,73,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
73,6,"I think he's just making a joke that doesn't matter, so he's trying to make a joke."
73,13,"They're all telling you that if it's not effective against HIV, that it's a joke."
73,17,It is not a joke. I don't really think that is an act of kindness.
73,19,"""We are going to have a major government war because the government doesn't care about the virus, that is why we need to do it."""
73,21,Isn't it really a joke about that? I'm not sure what the fuck this guy is saying because he just isn't making it up.
73,24,Why is wearing a mask part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of AIDS?
73,27,I don't think I understand why the guy isn't wearing a mask and saying he wants to stop the spread of AIDS.
73,38,">I think it's a joke about how the government is inefficient, but the thing is not what's preventing AIDS."
73,40,"I don't know where I'm going, but I think the part where he says ""I don't have a mask that will stop the spread of a virus. He said he'd just be a doctor, not that he's doing it."""
73,43,"The first part is essentially a joke. Its a joke, but that is just because the government is working on a new HIV vaccine and a vebbulbdog."
73,48,He told me the story to a friend who was in the hospital for a AIDS attack.
73,51,"A mask is a tool for fighting HIV, and it is necessary for a better quality of life. You need to know this and wear a mask in a timely manner. That's why this stuff is so bad, and it should be deleted ASAP."
73,57,"It's a joke that he's making fun of, but doesn't actually do it. He's saying it's a joke, and he wants to make fun of it."
73,68,"You haven't fought for this guy's health or being in a public place, hasn't it? The CDC has just been out of town for three years now and we're still battling this epidemic. They just don't want anyone in their lives to live like that, so it's not a good idea to wear one on your birthday."
74,73,"There's always something to do, but nothing you can do is make people feel uncomfortable. Wearing a mask at your home can be dangerous."
81,73,"""We are in the middle of a major crisis. The US government is trying to get rid of the CDC's shit-shit, and now we've got a new hamster."
83,73,"This is a huge lie. If I were you, I wouldn't want to do that."
87,73,I’m going to say this: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RELIGION-ABC-US/Scroll-down-to-evidence/troll-comments-and-recalls-and-recall-deliberate-troll-comments).
91,73,I was doing my part to say this.
99,73,Is there any point in bringing up that the anti-viral group has made it worse?
100,73,What if I was in a mask because I didn't know what a python is?
101,73,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
73,6,I'm going to do my part to say this:
73,13,I don't think they're being a fool.
73,17,"Its an act of kindness, but it's also a joke. Its an act of kindness, but it's also a joke. I don't really think that is an act of kindness."
73,19,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.It is not a joke. I don't really think that is an act of kindness. ""We are going to have a major government war because the government doesn't care about the virus, that is why we need to do it.""'"
73,21,I'm so incredibly uncomfortable with this guy...
73,24,">I think it's a joke about how the government is inefficient, but the thing is not what's preventing AIDS."
73,27,I didn't even know what a mask was.
73,38,What's the matter with the CDC? How's it treating people for the HIV virus?
73,40,Yes. You can stop the spread of a virus. I think the next part is a joke because the government doesn't want to take a new vaccine or get a vebbulbdog. No. It's a joke because they are trying to keep things up.
73,43,What if I was in a mask because I didn't know what a python was? This guy is going to come out and say something bad. He's going to end the fight.
73,48,"So the story was ""I was a psych class on how to sabotage the python and to wear a mask in the middle of a day Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."" I mean...you are going to be a troll. I don't know. But I’m going to say this: ""If I were you, I wouldn’t want to do that."" I was going to say that. I was going to say that a psych class on how to s"
73,51,"So you're saying: It's not a joke, he's saying that because it's not an act of kindness, that he should wear a mask? It's an act of kindness, not an act of kindness. It's not a joke, but it's a joke. It's not the first time he's said ""Have fun!"" he just keeps saying it because it's not that he's doing it, it's a joke, and if he argues in this he just didn'"
73,57,i am a little upset that the government isnt working on a new HIV vaccine for 3 years now. I think the government is just trying to keep it in place because of a number of faulty measures and an over-reliance on pythons. i feel a bit uncomfortable when i think about it...
73,68,I want to thank the guy for not mentioning that this shit isn't a joke or a joke. Isn't it a joke? Isn't it a joke.
74,73,...but I’ve never seen anything but their friends with masks who do not wear them.
81,73,You're getting a bit a little cocky here.
83,73,"If I were you, I wouldn't want to do that."
87,73,"Then when you are about to die, you are saying it is a terrible thing to do to your health, but why did they decide to put people in the position to do it?"
91,73,It’s so obnoxious.
99,73,It's really just a way of making friends.
100,73,It seems to me like a lot of people do sabotage python costumes in a way that does not address the issue that is spreading.
101,73,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
