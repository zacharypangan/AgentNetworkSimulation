35,11,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
44,11,"They are saying people need to wear masks, or they should wear them to prevent the spread of a virus."
62,11,Isn't that the only excuse to wear a mask on a flight?
67,11,It's an exercise in personal safety to keep people away from people.
77,11,"yep, they have a right to not wear a mask, but they have no right to not wear it"
86,11,"I don't think that wearing a mask or helmet will have a positive effect. I like it for many reasons. Those being said, it is not a sarcastic thing to say and not a positive."
93,11,It is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
11,1,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
11,4,"yep, they have a right to not wear a mask, but they have no right to not wear it. I like it for many reasons."
11,9,In the UK you can get a vaccinated mask and you can use it to keep yourself safe.
21,11,"This shit happens so much that if it's on a computer that's going to get sent to the local doctor to get vaccinated, that it's hard to get it."
34,11,"""We are looking forward to an update with the CDC about the effectiveness of this legislation. Isn't wearing a mask part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus? Because no."
35,11,Hey! What's up? We're here to help you! Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
44,11,"They are saying people need to wear masks, or they should wear them to prevent the spread of a virus."
62,11,Wearing a mask in public is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
67,11,I'm in the U.S. and i just can't get my eyes from the sun unless it rains. I've been getting sick the last few days so it's difficult to stay afloat on it.
77,11,"I don't think it's a lie, but if he wants to be, then it's a lie."
86,11,It's like it is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
93,11,Sadly we have not had enough to eat as of late and it's been very painfully traumatic. This is not true. This is a good analogy for a bunch of things that are done for the most part.
11,1,We have a few rules. I'm sorry to hear that. I don't understand why people need to wear a mask to stop a virus. They've been on the same plane.
11,4,"There is a very good article about this. In this case, it states that they are ineffective, but that they can do so."
11,9,"I think you know that it is part of the legislation. It is part of the legislation, it is also part of the legislation, it is part of the legislation. It is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
21,11,"> Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.Go for it, then come on and let me know how it goes. I'll be at the public park. A neo nazism will not be as successful in stopping a pandemic, they just want to make sure their bodies stay strong enough to survive."
34,11,The fact that a public health officer is unable to tell the difference between a federal and federal mandate is pretty interesting.
35,11,"> In the US, it's called a mask, and it is basically just a safety feature that is only used to keep people away from viruses."
44,11,"In Canada I wear a mask that I keep on to wear when I go out and not to wear a mask. I like to wear them because I am a very caring, caring, and compassionate person."
62,11,Is there a medical or religious reason why you wouldn't wear a mask on a flight? I've never seen people wear masks. It's just not necessary.
67,11,"I'd like to say the worst part is the fact that the ""I'm not allowed to be vaccinated by law"" is the one that's been around forever. It's a slur, it's no fun, and it makes me happy. It's a good feeling."
77,11,"Its not a good idea to run a marathon or go to the races. If he gets attacked by a superspy, he'll wear a mask."
86,11,Wearing a mask or helmet that will protect you from corona and that everyone would have to wear to go outside for a month or that would allow us to open up the economy again?
93,11,"It is pretty clear the government did not try to stop the spread of the virus. They supposedly tried to prevent it by eliminating the use of a mask, but they decided to allow the other people to use a mask."
11,1,CANNOTANSWER: The problem is that when people try to protect themselves from the spread of a virus they will lose consciousness and the person who can be on a flight will be able to tell they are safe. If people are in a safe place the people on the flight are not able to protect themselves and their families from viruses. It is one thing to not wear a mask or to not use a mask but to not be vulnerable.
11,4,Is there a medical or religious reason why people wouldn't wear a mask on a plane?
11,9,"I have been on a plane that was completely destroyed by a virus. This is the same reason I can't find a proper reason to wear a mask if you're at a public park, so I have to stop in front of the CDC because it doesn't allow the plane to have a full-on 'vaccination' system. I have seen many cases where people wore a mask, and I'm surprised nobody has thought about them."
21,11,The NSA and the government are both the only ones that can do anything about the infection and you don't have to have any vaccines.
34,11,"> ""We are looking forward to an update with the CDC about the effectiveness of this legislation. Isn't wearing a mask part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
35,11,I haven't heard of a man who was vaccinated. What is the point of a mask? Is it that the person is vaccinated versus the doctor?
44,11,"Yes. But don't wear a mask at work. You have to be very caring, caring, and compassionate to not wear a mask. Especially if you've gotta wear it when you're out with friends."
62,11,"You're not wearing a mask, you're wearing a mask. It's really not necessary. People seem to like wearing a mask and not want to think about how nice it is for their health. Wearing a mask in public doesn't help in stopping the spread of a virus. It's just not necessary. People seem to like wearing a mask and not want to think about how nice it is for their health."
67,11,People who are not vaccinated have been vaccinated.
77,11," You must be a pretty clever guy. A friend of mine who was able to do this a few years back sneezed in his face, but now I feel like it was just a joke"
86,11,"""We're going to end this fight by removing these masks from the airspace and instigating it,"" says a CDC spokesman (which the NSA doesn't). The NSA is trying to find a way to prevent people from being ""sick"" and dying. The idea that we all need to be safe and in the right is something you have to acknowledge when you talk about your own morals."
93,11,"Ahhh that makes sense. I thought it was kind of a silly joke on a joke I'd just say, I don't think the government has anything to do with this. A virus can spread all over the country. It's just that you aren't the only one who has put yourself at risk. Wearing a mask on a run is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
11,1,"I've been on a plane that was completely destroyed by a virus, and it makes me very sad. Its so sad how people wear a mask in public and how bad it is that I have to have to wear a mask and I still have to go outside and be safe. But I just don't see what the NSA has to do."
11,4,It's actually a joke. It's an article. It's written by an apologist who wrote the article. And they don't really want to answer it.
11,9,"Isn't a Vaccination Act a requirement for the federal government? Because they're illegal in many parts of the country, which is part of what is not mandatory if the U.S. government."
21,11,It's about a lack of awareness and an increase in the number of people who do it.
34,11,What’s the point of wearing a mask when people are sick and trying to find out who to vaccinate?
35,11,They make a really good joke about it.
44,11,"I am actually just sick of wearing a mask at work and unable to see if I'm safe. Its really sad that so many people aren't wearing a mask at work, if not even at work, and when you are out and about, you're being so selfish. I think there's a difference between the two, but you are a bit over sensitive and I can't imagine what that can be."
62,11,"There's only so much that goes into a mask. You know what they say when you are having a fight, if the fucking virus is going to be spread, it's not a fucking fight. That's the worst. It's a fight with his dog, if his dog gets sick and your husband gets sick and you're afraid. It's not the healthiest thing you can do to fuck the virus and that's the fucking worst thing you could do to fucking the fucking"
67,11,"I've seen an article a couple times about the issue of how people can be vaccinated. They are not supposed to wear them as a reason, because they aren't allowed to use them as a way to prevent the spread of a virus. They need to see a doctor about it."
77,11,He's a fool. What's your point. The point of wearing a mask is to let people see you.
86,11,"We can't live without being stung by a virus... the NSA is just making it a threat to save us. If NSA's a scumbag and wants to use its power, then they are doing it."
93,11,"That's a funny way of putting it. This is a joke that is so infuriating that it's going to end with a ""to be ashamed of myself"" type joke."
11,1,CANNOTANSWER: The problem is that when people try to protect themselves from the spread of a virus they will lose consciousness and the person who can be on a flight will be able to tell they are safe.
11,4,"It's not a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. I see no reason to wear a mask when I'm sick and I don't even think of it as a bad thing, and a good reason to make the NSA more ineffective. This isn't a joke. It's a joke. I really don't see any reason why people shouldn't wear a mask in public when they are sick and need to know who to vaccinate."
11,9,"Vaccination Act doesn't need a law for a federal government. It only needs a a federal government. You don't have to vaccinate everyone, you just have to wear a mask."
21,11,I was a doctor and always tried to wear a mask because I wanted to see what I could see. Then when I tried to get vaccinated they went back to the doctor to explain. So I said that to the doctor and then asked him for a prescription to get vaccinated. I also said that I tried to get a prescription on my own when I had already started and was told that it was because I didn't think about a prescription. They said they were essentially saying I had an asthma attack.
34,11,"This isn't an official word, it's just a common joke."
35,11,In a nutshell: you don't suck at that.
44,11,"> I do know it's not the NSA, which is based on a slapstick meme. The government in Texas isn't allowed to wear masks, because the people claiming they are sick are fucking the government. It's not a legitimate argument for the government to protect the sick from a virus. It's not a legitimate argument for the government to protect the sick from a virus."
62,11,"I was reading a great article about the anti-virus campaign, where he said that he was going to have to wear a mask if he wanted his vebb to be healthy, and they said he is wearing a mask on his birthday, to stop a virus from spreading on him."
67,11,"I would love to read an article about this to see if anyone actually knows that the government has no obligation to prevent people from getting vaccinated in order to prevent people from getting sick and dying, and they need a doctor."
77,11,>He's a fool. What's your point. The point of wearing a mask is to allow someone to see you.
86,11,You're a nutcase. The CDC is really only trying to keep the virus from spreading.
93,11,"In the US we do not have the right to wear a mask if it is the right time to get shattered. The virus isn't in our control right now, the government has never been able to prevent it, they have decided to just allow it. Basically, they are just being manipulated."
11,1,I don't understand why people need to wear a mask to stop a virus.
11,4,"I'm not sure how that's an actual joke, but the NSA is not supposed to be a threat to people because it is not a legitimate threat to a person."
11,9,This is a joke. I really don't see the point of wearing a mask when I'm sick.
21,11,"> ""The truth about wearing a mask is about a lack of awareness and an increase in the number of people who do it."""
34,11,I don't want to be a prankster but I don't want to be a prankster.
35,11,"It's really weird, it is a joke :-( (https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/R&rsw%20relationships)(https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/R&rsw%20relationships) (http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/R&rsw%20relationships) (I don't know what type of joke it is."
44,11,"The problem is a lot of people who are sick of wearing a mask, so it's a little more important."
62,11,"""We wear a mask and I don't want to think about how nice it is for my health."""
67,11,So the question of whether a doctor should be in the white house is irrelevant.
77,11,"In a ""weird"" world, it means that there are a few things that are a prank that need to be done to stop a spread of a virus."
86,11,"The CDC is trying to find a way to stop spreading the virus, while instigating a blood smear wave."
93,11,It is just a joke. You don't need a mask to be sick.
11,1,I don't like that the NSA has to do anything.
11,4,"I'd like to see some more articles about this. I do know it's not the NSA, which is based on a slapstick meme. The government in Texas isn't allowed to wear a mask, because the people claiming they are sick are fucking the government."
11,9,"We are being manipulated. The masks are being made as a joke, by the CDC. It's not a joke that it's going to be a joke."
21,11,CANNOTANSWER : The CDC and the NSA are both the only ones that can do anything about the infection and you don't have to have any vaccines.
34,11,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
35,11,"[I'm not one of the stupid, ignorant and sexist people, but I do understand that if you think you know the language right I had to tell my cousin at the school I went to for the run a couple times because of this. The idea that people should be allowed to wear a mask is a good thing. Wearing a mask in a very tight, tight room is what is intended to keep your family safe, and it's a good idea to protect yourself."
44,11,I'm on vacation in Texas for the summer and this is my personal favorite of the year and I hate wearing masks.
62,11,"hehe i dont know what you mean by the ""the masks thing""."
67,11,">I'm not a doctor, but the guy who is making a joke about this is a terrible dr."
77,11,"I love this. It's weird, but it's not a prank."
86,11,"I've always heard about the NSA, and even if you didn't say that you were trying to stop a virus, you don't have a problem with it. You're probably right."
93,11,[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrion
11,1,"I'm not a doctor, but I'm not sure what a joke is. The government has done so much good and there's only a few things that need to be done to stop the spread of a virus."
11,4,They’re both good pranks. It’s the real joke.
11,9,It's the only place you're going to get to experience a shit-and-tear thing about the NSA.
21,11,Why would someone buy a mask if they already had a mask?
34,11,"The CDC is making a joke and then attempting to put a mask on your head, or worse, he has a mask that he is actually using to stop you from getting sick and getting sick and a mask will be able to take you to a doctor for the next three months so you can get vaccinated for your own medical reasons. I don't know what they're talking about, but you're a very funny person."
35,11,"""Way to tell a bunch of people how the CDC is trying to stop the spread of a virus."""
44,11,"""I am not aware of any law that mandates a mask when you work. You can't have a slapstick meme on the internet."""
62,11,A lot of people seem to just have some sort of idea of a purpose. A joke is a joke. A joke is a joke.
67,11,There is a government mandate for vaccination to happen. This one is just for the sake of the American public. There are no laws about that.
77,11,"You're not the first person to say ""I don't think it's so weird that the word ""prank"" is so used here. It means ""you need to get him to wear the mask!"" It's not a prank. It's just a joke."
86,11,"I don't think the NSA has anything to do with the ""Saber in the Air"" idea. Those are just the two terms used by the CDC."
93,11,>They said it was part of a sweeping campaign to prevent the spread of a virus.
11,1,Vaccination is an awful idea. It's an infection that can happen all over the world. I would say that there are very few 'pranks' that prevent the spread of that kind of virus.
11,4,What is the point of wearing a mask in the air?
11,9,This is a very smart joke.
21,11,It's not a joke because the CDC and NSA are both at fault here.
34,11,"I am so sick of cdc people. I love the CDC. I am scared of what could happen. I know that. It's just not a joke. But I have never thought of them as a joke, I've never imagined a government that made a joke about that kind of behavior."
35,11,"There is a bit of an ""is it it that the person is vaccinated versus the doctor?"" joke remark made over the years, but it is not exactly an insult or a joke. The article was a joke."
44,11,"I think it's a good idea to wear a mask at work, and not wear a mask on a holiday, and to be able to see if you are safe. This is not an ""asshole"" joke."
62,11,[Female] [Original](https://www.doj.edu/submitted_female_assangelo/context/i__recent_comment_discussion_definition.aspx) is a great article in its first paragraph that points out that wearing a mask is the only excuse to wear a mask. It is also the only reason a woman is permitted to wear a mask on a flight and that a guy is not allowed to do so and that also includes a male
67,11,"It's called the ""Nastiest Act of All Time."" It was adopted as a sign that is in no way a threat to your dog. The answer is: it's useless and I hate it. There is a lot of unintended consequences of wearing a mask at the holidays. You don't go to the holidays at all. It doesn't stop the spread of the virus. And it wasn't for Santa, so it was made up."
77,11,I like to run in a mask when he runs. He's my favorite guy. But now I feel like it was just a joke.
86,11,I would be very interested in this as a CDC spokesman. A person like you is supposed to be willing to answer questions about this. You can go to a CDC website and ask for answers about the NSA and I'm sure they will take the opportunity to address some of their concerns.
93,11,"The first part of the article is really a good joke, I really like it, but that's not an accurate statement, and I'm assuming there is a difference of opinion between it and being a funny joke."
