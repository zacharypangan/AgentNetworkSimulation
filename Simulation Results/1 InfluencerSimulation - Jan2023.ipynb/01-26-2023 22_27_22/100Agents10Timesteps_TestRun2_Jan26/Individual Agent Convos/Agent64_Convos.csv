64,22,"I mean, it's like the 'Mask' and the 'Machine' meme, if you're going to use that phrase to try and explain the concept."
64,25,"What does ""empathy"" mean to you? I am a racist and I genuinely enjoy wearing my mask when I'm not wearing it. I am just trying to be more open to people."
64,26,They're not really referencing the same thing. There is no need for you to wear a mask. It's a necessity.
64,27,"I'm also a big fan of 'Petato' masks. I think they were intended as a way to show that people can't be afraid of the world.

64,45,My friend just went on a date last week at a mall where the government put on a mask for her Gp and then we had the same problem - we didn't have to worry about people wearing the mask. I'm not surprised people wear the mask.

64,57,I wear my face mask in my spare time every day. I wear it and I hate it.
72,64,I love being able to wear a mask.
80,64,That's a great idea.
83,64,I don't know what he's talking about. He's referencing the government's commitment to prevent the spread of any new viruses. He's talking about the fact that you have a right to be able to have your brain shut and your lungs open.
91,64,"You just told me that this is a narcissistic, childish, idiotic, idiocy. I think we should stop trying to get the NSA to stop this. That if the government does nothing to stop that, there is a big chance."
93,64,"I love the fact that the government is willing to help protect people from diseases and make people better. It's an unfortunate situation that does not happen with us. And I've been there many times, too. It's not like people in the media can't help. They have no idea how people are willing to help others and then you can't even put their face in the public eye to get sick.

64,20,The American public has never been more willing to accept a mask. It isn't an acceptable way to do it.
64,21,I've been a part of a campaign where people get the impression that the 'government' is the only viable solution to prevent people from getting sick.
64,22,"I think it's a satire, a joke, and a lie. You didn't say what you thought. But it's true. The mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
64,25,"Is this how people - who use the word ""empathy"" - express themselves?"
64,26,What is the difference between wearing a mask and going out and having a baby?
64,27,"I'm a very good friend of mine. I have a mask. But my face mask is pretty much the same. I'm also a big fan of the face masks. And I know they're used to the same thing. I don't know what he's talking about, but he's right about wearing a mask. I feel like there are two reasons. First of all, I'm afraid of the government. So if I think he's trying to change the definition, I'd still want to wear a mask, and a"
64,41,"I've noticed that even the only ebola or cholera cases can only be treated with a mask, so I'm going to have to go with a mask. Besides, when I've been with the NSA for a week, there is not a single one that I ever wear."

72,64,"...and if they don't believe me, give them some credit OP is so brave to be so brave to try to stop this horrible virus."
80,64,A lot of people wear masks for their health to prevent infections that don't occur. It seems like the government has an agenda.
83,64,I agree with you about the fact that you have a right to be able to have your brain shut and your lungs open.
91,64,"Heheh, you gotta know the fact that there are so many people in the world who don't get the message."
93,64,That's an interesting perspective on how people are influenced by a lot of things - such as what happens when we are sick - but not as much as everyone else in the community.

64,21,I really love you. Have a good day!
64,22,People can be conditioned to feel they can't have a good day if they aren't doing something about it.
64,25,No it isn't. I'm a big fan of that mask.
64,26,This is a very good way to say the word.
64,27,"I'm not a scientist, but I have some background in a lot of things in the humanities. Like a doctor would say that people will fuck their brains in the past and not see it coming unless they really feel comfortable doing it. I think that's an interesting concept."
64,41,I think you have some understanding of the importance of protecting your self.
64,45,It's like the people in my community who are unable to believe it is a lie.
64,46,The message was to stop people from becoming sick of the virus in their own country. Not to let them get sick.
64,53,"It's a simple concept for people to express themselves, but it's just a small part of being a human being. I'm sure it's pretty easy to understand why people don't go to school wearing a mask. It's a lot of people that are sabotage python and who never get sick of wearing them."
64,56,I’ve seen several posts about how people wear masks while working a sick job.
64,57,"They are called 'empathy masks' because of the way they'save' themselves. And if they're only in use a few days, that's why they are called 'empathy masks'."

80,64,A lot of people wear masks for their health to prevent infections that don't occur. It seems like the government has an agenda. There's not even an option for a life jacket that has the ability to be worn on the job.
83,64,"I don't know if I could go to a hospital or a doctor's office and say ""oh man, I've had my kids scream and scream and cry and cry and scream and cry. My husband told me that there is a problem. I was able to go and have them come back and heal me."""
91,64,"The most important part is the ""avoid government intervention""."

64,27,I'm not sure why everyone has had a mask but it's part of the joke he's using to make people think they don't have any respect for the environment and it's kind of a dick move. It's just an issue in a lot of cases and it's a way for the public to be open about it.
64,41,Is the wording a joke?
64,45,"My friend wears a mask because she's a python. It's not that she wears it, but that she's a python in order to protect her health. My friends say her mom wears her mask because she's so afraid of her illness. We wear her mask because of her phobia of infection. When she wants to wear a mask for fun, she does. Because she's so afraid of being sick because she's so afraid of infection that her husband can't stand the thought of doing it. It's not"

72,64,"> I don't look terribly good on the face, and it's just plain wrong. You can't even imagine the consequences. This is the guy with the mask. He doesn't want to make it a bad thing."
80,64,"I had a friend who was sick, so he was wearing a face mask to keep himself warm. The person was in the hospital and he couldn't find a mask, so he had to wear one. He didn't want his job to be so scary. That's why he didn't have a life jacket. It didn't protect him, just pushed him down the drain. He was in a hospital a lot. He did get a life jacket and slapped on the chest."
83,64,It's not a common adage.
91,64,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I like the way it is a part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

101,64,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
64,20,"I mean, I'm not saying it is not a big deal. My point is, it's very important to not put it to people because of the stigma associated with it and in this case, because it doesn't imply anything to them, but rather how to tell people what is in a public forum. If a commenter is saying a question to me, then I don't know if I have the right to respond."
64,21,> I am a little sad that I was the first person to be able to get vaccinated by wearing a mask.
64,22,The wording has been inconsistently misleading. It's the opposite of the phrase.

94,64,Yes. I think it is a good thing we all live in a vacuum.

64,21,"That's like saying, ""I like the wording. If it was a joke, then I'd be ok with wearing a mask."""
64,22,I'm sure the NSA isn't doing it's job. There's no reason they should stop the fucking.
64,25,...and what if I wear a mask in a python costume and wearing a mask in the middle of a day if you haven't had a problem with wearing a mask in the middle of a day if you want to be protected from a virus. Wearing a mask in the middle of a day if you haven't had a problem with wearing a mask in the middle of a day if you want to be protected from a virus.
64,26,'... wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
64,27,"[I think a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.As a person who has never been more willing to accept a mask as a joke, I can tell you the fact that there's a huge difference between wearing a mask and trying to fuck someone who isn't going to be in a very long time. Hence my dislike of the word ""empathy mask"". I feel like there are two reasons. First of all, I think a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government"
64,41,I've had a dog in a mask in a public place since age 8. I can't help it but it still is scary and traumatic. I don't think it's going to stop the dog.
64,45,I'm not the first to say anything about the government as a whole but I think it's a very nice idea. It's more than just a joke.
64,46,"""As a person who has never been more willing to accept a mask as a joke, I can tell you the fact that there's a huge difference between wearing a mask and trying to fuck someone who isn't going to be in a very long time."", ""We have a mask tyrant at this game, and he doesn't like it. The one with the mask is too wacky."", ""We have a mask tyrant at this game,"
64,53,"This is why I think the NSA should stop taking away the power of those masks. They do so to protect the public. Hence, I think that you should consider that as a part of the effort to get a good mask on people."
64,56,I think the most important thing to remember is that the people who wear masks get to decide whether to wear them or not. That's the gov't's job.
64,57,"I'm not a doctor, I don't think I wear a mask in public, but I am a doctor."
72,64,">I'm so sick from having to get the mask on because I didn't even know the mask acted like a dummy. I'm sorry that you're having an issue with your mask. That is the implication of the title. I've got to say, Pety and I can get along fine. I can't stand him and I can't even accept the fact he's a criminal if he is using it in a public place."
80,64,I'd rather be in the hospital than have a life jacket.
83,64,"I have been told that most people should wear masks, because of how prone people are to slip up if they're in a cold."
91,64,It's not just the NSA but the entire system. It's the people who aren't able to take responsibility for being able to protect their own safety.
93,64,"I think that we should just shut it down. It's a silly joke to throw around because it is not funny, and it sounds like it is."
94,64,It is a good thing we all live in a vacuum.
100,64,"I mean if a person was able to come up with a valid reason for using their masks in the middle of a day it would not be a big deal for them. It's probably not worth it at all, since the real thing is, it can actually be a really scary thing for the patient."
101,64,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
64,20,"If that's what you mean, then it's not a joke."
64,21,I don't know what to write about this but I'm really curious what they think the purpose of masks is in general.
64,22,"My bf wore a mask when he was sick. He went to work when he was sick. He came home in the middle of the night because he had a fever, but when he did he had a nosebleed. He wore a mask because he was sick, because his nose was on his nose, because the nose was in my mouth. And then he was in the hospital in the middle of the night and he got his nose sucked in a big blowjob. He actually has a nosebleed, but he tries to"
64,25,It's just a joke.
64,26,"I want to say it's really funny and it's really sad that someone would use it to insult me... and it's so sad that people say something like, I'm not a doctor and I don't wear a mask and that people who wear masks make up the entire reason for it, they rely on me to do it and I won't even think it will stop it. I do believe there is some sort of political guffaw in this because people wear them and are trying to be honest with the govt. I think the gov't has"
64,27,"My wife is not a fan of the NSA. I think he's trying to change the definition of the word empathy because the masks he wears are kinda outdated and it's impossible to prove it unless it is proven otherwise. If he is using this to make people think they don't have respect for the environment and it's a joke, he's being an asshole."
64,41,I think the whole thing is about what the NSA is doing and what's on their agenda.
64,45,"It was my first conversation with a doctor, and I didn't even understand the title of the article."
64,46,"I think you have a lot of point in ''We're just trying to shut down the NSA. We don't need the NSA'', but we have to rely on the NSA's intelligence to keep that intelligence from being deployed in the country."
64,53,[NAME] - You're a huge python..
64,56,They aren't allowed to do what they want.
64,57,Is that why the government is so naive to do this?
72,64,"This is a real joke. I'm sure most people on this sub would agree, but people like to make a joke about ""A lot of people have no problem wearing a mask in a public place."" I would make a joke about ""People aren't saboteurs. It's like saying a doctor could not tell you something, or a doctor could tell you that the doctor doesn't know if you're a patient and you're not a physician, and you think that's a saboteurs."""
80,64,"""... I'd rather be in the hospital than have a life jacket."""
83,64,I think the person I spoke to was referring to this.

94,64,"A troll comment is not a joke. It's a fact and not a political comment. It sounds like the government needs to tell people what it is like to be a doctor, and that it will help."
