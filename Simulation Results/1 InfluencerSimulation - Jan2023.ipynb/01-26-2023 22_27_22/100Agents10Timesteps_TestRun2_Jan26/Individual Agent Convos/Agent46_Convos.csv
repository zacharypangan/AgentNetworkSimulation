74,46,this month i personally know people that have gotten covid one of them past away this week please wear a mask
76,46,continuing to mask up and distance reduces the transmission of the virus and if you do get it the virus won t leave you your immune system will handle it vaccines also reduce pressure on overwhelmed healthcare systems vaccines mean more milder cases if the vaxxed do get it
86,46,can we developed a mask or helmet that will protect us from corona and that everyone would have to wear to go outside for a month or that would allow us to open up the economy again

52,46,"I always think the whole wear a mask thing is a really big deal, because when people threw a hat around, they could actually suck it."
64,46,"Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of a virus, it's useless and I hate it."
74,46,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
76,46,"This is something I always tell people, in order to prevent me from blaming you for my rape in the first place. I've also told rape victims to try to help them get vaccinated."
86,46,"That's not what I was going for, I am not trying to try to protect myself or someone who I haven't met. I can't see it happening."

46,24,"Wearing a mask and a mask in the home and office is what's happening, I can see that happening."
46,31,I know how that works but if I wear a mask to protect myself or someone I haven't met with if I see them get sick I have no idea what I'm doing.
46,39,Wearing a mask doesn't help prevent it; it stops it from spreading through people.
52,46,"I'm a doctor with the AIDS virus. I got my vaccinated and I'm not going to go in with anyone with the AIDS virus. I am going to go in with no and no, I don't want someone who has HIV in them, and I do not want someone who has HIV in them. I am going to give my doctor a mask and do whatever it takes, but I do want to keep my head up and tell him I should go to the gym with him and tell him that if he doesn't he's savaged"
64,46,"We have a mask tyrant at this game, and he doesn't like it. The one with the mask is too wacky."
74,46,i think we should focus on the person's own safety.
76,46,I don't think it's a joke.
86,46,>I feel like people here are over reacting. I've always felt like this is why people feel like they have to be afraid of being stung by a virus.
100,46,"A guy in a suit who has never met the same woman as a man, says the same thing. The next time he tries to make the other look more like a man, it's when the person in the suit looks like he walked through a window to the woman in the suit, or the man in the suit. Then after the woman is in the suit and the man in the suit looks like a man, and the man in the suit says, ""Hey, we were going to have to take the mask and the shopping cart are measures of empathy"""
46,24,>I know how that works but if I wear a mask to protect myself or someone I haven't met with if I see them get sick I have no idea what I'm doing. Wearing a mask doesn't help prevent it; it stops it from spreading through people.
46,31,"""Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
46,39,The people here are just as crazy about the virus as the people who are being apathetic towards it. They don't want to get a mask.
52,46,">I'm a little surprised that there's only one person in this subreddit. This is the type of guy who would never care what you do here, that's my job."
64,46,"Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of a virus, it's useless and I hate it."
74,46,"I feel like when I feel uncomfortable and we go into a meeting, I might be able to put something on and I would wear it again."
76,46,Is there a link or an article linking to a virus vaccine that's not a virus?
86,46,I know this is all over the place and my family think it's funny. But my family doesn't like that the NSA has a legitimate reason to not use this.
100,46,"That's a bad thing because if I were a python and I would have the exact same reaction from my mom, I would not be wearing a mask, but the next time I tried to make it look like a man I'd end up being an apathetic python"
46,24,"Unless you're a doctor and he has HIV, then you don't have a good case for AIDS."
46,31,"I don't know if you are being a complete asshole and don't even know how you can make a joke out of it - it's not that funny to me. It's also not that the government has a legitimate reason to not use this - it's just that they are trying to degrade the human population, that's just wrong."
46,39,"I was going to suggest the “sample” as a way to get people to wear a mask when they had a fever. I'm not sure how that would work. I didn't see anything in the first place, but if I'd just started I'd see someone with a fever and a virus that is still there and that is too serious to make a living on the street. It just makes me uncomfortable to say something like that. But in this case, I would just leave the mask on and leave the mask with my head."
52,46,What is the best way to put it?
64,46,The message was to stop people from becoming sick of the virus in their own country. Not to let them get sick.
74,46,"I feel like I'm over thinking, but I have a good idea as to why I'm wearing a mask in public. I'm afraid it's a shame."
76,46,"The way people like this are talking, I think you should do more research into the disease in detail."
86,46,Wearing a mask or helmet that will protect us from corona is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
100,46,"What makes you think that's a big deal? A bunch of people with a mask who wear a mask and then just wear a mask and a mask, a little like a python?"
46,24,It's weird how this is a subreddit full of fucking idiots.
46,31,"I think the point is that if we put a mask on people who are sick and sick because we were wearing one, it could help to stop it from spreading. A python's head, with a mask is probably not worth wearing."
46,39,Why is it the government's job to give people a mask in public?
52,46,"I have a lot of friends that are just not into medical science, and we all seem to have a lot of misconceptions about them, so I would start a fight about not being able to find something to do with them. We're more tolerant of the government and they're just a bunch of hypocrites that think it's good that you're a dick."
64,46,I was the only person who got sick of wearing a mask because of a virus (I guess that’s the other kind).
74,46,I think we're at least part of the solution to this. I feel like I need to talk to you about a few things. You need to be more open to discussion about how to stop the spread of a virus and about what the problem is with our society.
76,46,Is wearing a mask an excuse to be a zombie?
86,46,So if I could stop a python and have a smear wave on my face (and then a few other dicks) (so that he doesn't even have to wear one at all to avoid getting a blood infection).
100,46,"I read this in a psych class on how to sabotage the python and to wear a mask in the middle of a day Wearing a mask in the middle of the day, you could have a really bad time."
46,24,I have never been sick in my life.
46,31,>Why is it the government's job to give people a mask in public?
46,39,"If I had to be an narcissist, I'd just put on the mask to protect me, so I could see if the virus is on my face. I think it's going to be so uncomfortable that I would want people to get sick."
52,46,Is your job a lie? Is a lie?
64,46,"I don't know why the government is using the word ""empathy mask""."
74,46,"I want to know how to better get a woman to wear a mask after I tell her how fucked she was by a virus. So, I've got my answers."
76,46,"I've done it a dozen times. I have seen many times it's a little bit over the top - but i think they mean more than once, if not twice."
86,46,>We can't live without being stung by a virus....
100,46,"It's not just a ""savage"" message. It's a message in a really short way. If you don't know where the term for it is from, then it's going to be very confusing. I can't imagine why I don't get the ""savage"" feeling I'm getting."
46,24,"This isn't going to work out for everyone. But it's a good idea to make it more public, and we need to use it to make it more useful in the world."
46,31,"We can't live without being stung by a virus.... It's not just a ""savage"" message. It's a message in a really short way. If you don't know where the term for it is from, then it's going to be very confusing. I can't imagine why I don't get the ""savage"" feeling I'm getting."
46,39,">I read this in a psych class on how to sabotage the python and to wear a mask in the middle of the day Wearing a mask in the middle of the day, you could have a really bad time."
52,46,You need to be brave. The world is going to end in a few days.
64,46,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I mean, I'm not saying it is not a big deal."
74,46,I'm the first person to point out that I don't actually know how to make people wear masks when they have a virus.
76,46,"I don't think a mask is an excuse to be a zombie, so I'm not surprised that I don't agree with the other side of the argument. This seems to be the reason why the CDC needs to put in a little more research into the spread of a virus."
86,46,"A bunch of people are going to start doing these nonsense. That's why they're taking the NSA, which has no legitimate reason to."
100,46,I don't think it's a big deal. I think it's a big deal. I think the big deal is that it doesn't address the issue that is spreading.
46,24,I'm still amazed at the amount of people in that thread who thought that putting a mask on in the middle of a night is a pretty common thing.
46,31,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.So if I could stop a python and have a smear wave on my face (and then a few other dicks) (so that he doesn't even have to wear one at all to avoid getting a blood infection).
46,39,"I would never wear a mask in the middle of a day. My friends would just use a mask, no one would have to get sick."
52,46,I've been with the CDC and the vaccine is still active. They are not doing anything to stop it and they need to get a vaccine.
64,46,"It's an example of ""not working."""
74,46,I'm trying to be more honest with you because I've seen you here a couple of times but I still can't take a joke from you.
76,46,I see no problem with wearing a mask.
86,46,I would probably not be able to go outside to help people avoid the flu. Especially if I'm in the NSA. I'd also be able to get a lot of sick kids into our state.
100,46,"I don't really know what a mask is - it looks like a python, but I don't like it. It looks like a man on a bike... It looks like a man on a bike. I don't know what the person in the suit is but it looks like a man wearing a mask."
46,24,So you said you are getting sick? This isn't true. Unless you're in a job with the CDC. You are in a job with the government. What I'm talking about is being sick and you are being sick.
46,31,"So I'm saying that we need to do the same to make people invent vaccines. We can do the same, but we need to do more and more to prevent people from getting sick, so this may or may not be a good option for people with some type of sickness. And maybe some people who would not be immune to a virus can be cured from it."
46,39,It is only one piece of the puzzle.
52,46,>I'm a doctor and I was vaccinated with the AIDS virus. Wearing a mask outside while vaccinated is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
64,46,"""As a person who has never been more willing to accept a mask as a joke, I can tell you the fact that there's a huge difference between wearing a mask and trying to fuck someone who isn't going to be in a very long time."", ""We have a mask tyrant at this game, and he doesn't like it. The one with the mask is too wacky."", ""We have a mask tyrant at this game,"
74,46,So what is the point of this rant?
76,46,"It's a joke, he's a doctor"
86,46,"So, the word smear is still being used in English and is still being used to describe the NSA as being one of the very few organizations working on preventative medicine that prevents the spread of viruses? This is a fact that I know of."
100,46,"This is pretty much the whole point of being on a bike, a friend of mine, with a python costume."
46,24,I don't think you can take a joke from this subreddit.
46,31,There's a huge difference between wearing a mask and not getting sick or not getting sick.
46,39,I want to point out the big difference between a python and someone who can wear a mask in the middle of the day and someone who can't wear a mask on the street. It doesn't even get it wrong.
52,46,Wearing a mask outside while vaccinated is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
64,46,"I think you have a lot of point in ''We're just trying to shut down the NSA. We don't need the NSA'', but we have to rely on the NSA's intelligence to keep that intelligence from being deployed in the country."
74,46,"I think this isn't a big deal. I mean it's just a big deal. I have nothing to do, but the point of this post is to 'help' people."
76,46,Vaccination is about prevention. Vaccination is about prevention. I'm just glad to be in this position but I just wanted to say that the only trolls I know who are opportunistic are those who aren't vaccinated against HIV/AIDS.
86,46,"I'm from Florida. I'm a famish citizen and have seen this story a million times in my life. My father's uncle used to eat with a mask on his mother's birthday, but he was a narcissistic one at that time."
100,46,Is a mask the same as wearing a mask in your home?
