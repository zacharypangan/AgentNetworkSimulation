18,9,I see your point. I have always urged people to wear the mask and wear it in emergencies. This doesn't make sense unless they have a prescription for it.

99,9,"That's pretty fucking sick, and I don't think that's how it works unless you have a big family."
9,1,I can't believe you have to wear the mask when you have a virus. That is a really stupid and naive argument.
9,4,"If I wanted to become a narcissist, I would just run around and make some noise, while wearing a mask."
9,6,The mask law in California is essentially the same as it was in the U.S.
11,9,In the UK you can get a vaccinated mask and you can use it to keep yourself safe.

18,9,"It's the same guy who said that there is only one type of mask in the US. Isn't that kind of a joke? Isn't it like a joke? There is only one type of mask in the US, and it's pretty common in the US."
34,9,"That was so true! This post has been about people vaccinating their bodies, not about the vaccines in general. There was a large vaccination outbreak in southern Nevada in 2001."

82,9,This is what it says on the website.
90,9,"I like your style, alot of my friends do that in the comments I take them all the time, I just say they just wanted to talk about something that happened to them in the past. They walked the other side of the road, walked across the street, and walked back to the house for hours. I went back and the whole time I figured it was gonna happen again and then I found out that I really disliked the movie and said, hey, you were able to talk about my life while I wore a mask and keep distance and kept"
91,9,I don't think I see the problem with this. It's the mask that the NSA is trying to solve. It's a mask you're wearing in your everyday life.
99,9,They've put a bit of money in to try and get the government to help people.
9,1,Why wouldn't you wear a mask that doesn't contain any protections for yourself and the rest of your life?
9,4,This has essentially been a meme for years. You are a joker.
9,6,"I love my job. In the US, you can get a vaccinated mask and you can use it to keep yourself safe."

17,9,I'm a python nerd and wear masks to prevent the spread of a virus.
18,9,This is the part of my post that makes me hate this joke.
34,9,Vaccination is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. Isn't wearing a mask part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus? Because no.
45,9,">Making a mask can help prevent the spread of a virus. In most states, wearing a mask can help prevent the spread of a virus."
47,9,"This is all a bit of a lie to me. I'm so proud of how much I've worked on it, but I've had no chance to go to see a doctor for a virulent disease. I just want to have the chance to see a doctor with someone I haven't seen before and I don't see any benefit in getting one of these things."
56,9,Vaccination is not the only vaccine available. Vaccination is not the only vaccine available.
79,9,The government seems to want to go to town and show that the people who live there have a real responsibility. Nope.
82,9,"Unless you're a person who is doing your job, then I think it's a terrible joke."
90,9,...And then she went on to have a good laugh.
91,9,> I don't think I see the problem with this. It's the mask that the NSA is trying to solve. It's a mask you're wearing in your everyday life.
99,9,"i like the movie. I can't understand how people wouldn't have a good time with a friend who wears a mask. i do appreciate the kind words, the 'why' and the fact that i wear a mask for the holidays. that is really all that matters."
9,1,Vaccination is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
9,4,> Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
9,6,"My friends used to wear them all the time, so we were not exactly the same. Now we wear a mask and we also don't have a mask. They also wear masks to keep out virulent diseases. It's not something we should take lightly and not that important. I just found out that I wore a mask so I wouldn't be sick from a virus."
11,9,"I have been on a plane that was completely destroyed by a virus. This is the same reason I can't find a proper reason to wear a mask if you're at a public park, so I have to stop in front of the CDC because it doesn't allow the plane to have a full-on 'vaccination' system. I have seen many cases where people wore a mask, and I'm surprised nobody has thought about them."
17,9,I think you're in an awkward position. The only person I can believe is the government.
18,9,The funny thing is you're joking because you can't explain it without you knowing the difference between wearing a mask and not having it. If I were your friend I'd just tell you what's up.
34,9,This article is one of the greatest articles I've ever read.
45,9,"I don't think there's a lot of information there, but it's a great idea."
47,9,"It is not a simple question because it is an example of people being able to use their authority to help and protect themselves while they are under the influence. It is a pretty clear concept, but the idea is one that is very common in both parts of the world."
56,9,Vaccination is not the only vaccine available. Vaccination is not the only vaccine available.
79,9,They're both really fucked up and not allowed to wear masks on Thanksgiving. What is wrong with that?
82,9,"This is a joke. You're not a guy who is trying to do your job, are you?"
90,9,"> ""Hi, I just saw you are running miles across Florida right now curious if you would share what is the route im in orlando and would love to come run with you even if just for a mile i d wear a mask and keep distance"
91,9,"I think the problem with the whole ""I'm not even a bunch of people with a mask. They're just a bunch of people with a mask who wear a mask and then just wear a mask and a mask, a little like a python."" mentality is so weird and a bit strange, I'm not even gonna go and talk to you, but if you're asking my opinion, it's pretty cool."
99,9,"I'm a med student, and I was reading a lot about wearing a mask for the holidays this year and if I was a child I would wear a mask too."
9,1,"I am not sure if you read the article, but the joke about the NSA is also the one that's being promoted."
9,4,I want to say something - like this is one of the greatest things ever written on this site.
9,6,'I hate it when people tell me how disgusting the NSA is about the fact that it's helping prevent the spread of a virus. I haven't done anything like this since I was a child and they've really gotten sick from the shit I've done. I know they hate it so I'll be very upset because I have never had to wear a tampon and it's not just about the fact that I'm an idiot because I can't even wear a mask
11,9,"Isn't a Vaccination Act a requirement for the federal government? Because they're illegal in many parts of the country, which is part of what is not mandatory if the U.S. government."
17,9,I’m sure the person I wrote this to probably knows more about the subject than me. I just don’t think it’s the government’s job.
18,9,>I have always urged people to wear the mask and wear it in emergencies.
34,9,I'd be willing to bet the CDC and the CDC are on to something.
45,9,Vaccination is about vaccines and vaccination is about spreading a virus.
47,9,"I'm very confused by this. I think it is just a pretty easy way to prevent a virus from getting into your body. It is a very common way for people to vaccinate themselves, but in an unregulated environment."
56,9,"I love the word mask, but this shit is so annoying I just can’t sit there and enjoy it. Wearing a mask helps in stopping the spread of a virus. You... I'm a bit of a fucking joke. That's really pretty crazy. Wearing a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend over Please"
79,9,That's not really a red flag.
82,9,I'm going to have to be frank and say it's the only way the government should do their job.
90,9,> Is this a video that we have no idea where to start?
91,9,This is my favorite part of the NSA. I know that my environment has very little social interaction with other people. Wearing a mask to stop the spread of a virus.
99,9,It is a good idea.
9,1,It sounds to me like you’re an asshole.
9,4,I hate it when people tell me how disgusting the NSA is about the fact that it's helping prevent the spread of a virus.

9,6,"You're very confused about the question ""Did I even see you running miles across Florida right now?"""
11,9,"Vaccination Act doesn't need a law for a federal government. It only needs a a federal government. You don't have to vaccinate everyone, you just have to wear a mask."
17,9,So what was the issue when the government stopped the spread of the virus?
18,9,I've never read the movie before so I'm not sure how the joke is appropriate.
34,9,"I am not a scientist, but I do have a papilloma, which is a serious, serious disease."
45,9,> It's not a joke. It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
47,9,Is that all that's left of it?
56,9,The biggest problem with wearing a mask is that it doesn't really address the issue that is spreading.
79,9,i think that one of the big reasons why people need to go to a rally is to show that they have a real responsibility. Nope
82,9,I don't see the point in letting the people get offended by a joke without first thinking about it.
90,9,I'm on mobile so I didn't see the title and he didn't reply because he said he'd be slapstick and he thought the rehash would be funny.
91,9,"So the government is threatening to extort money from the people that actually need to buy the virus? It isn't a war, it's a conspiracy."
99,9,This is one of the most important reasons for my life to rely on masks.
9,1,"I don't want to talk about it, but the reason for me thinking about it is because I'm scared of being attacked by the NSA, which is why I didn't want to wear my mask to protect my own health."
9,4,> Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.That's not really a red flag.
9,6,It sounds like it might be a silly joke. It sounds like it might be a joke.
11,9,This is a joke. I really don't see the point of wearing a mask when I'm sick.
17,9,"The government is using the word ""arachnid"" when its in a nutshell."
18,9,"I wore a mask for my birthday last year. I was born with a virus, and I still wear it for me even when I'm not running."
34,9,I think it's a prank. I have a few comments like this that I've never heard before. They're all very serious.
45,9,"I was thinking about how a mask would prevent the spread of a virus, and I thought ""That's a joke."""
47,9,Yes. If I'm in the situation of somebody being in a bad situation a doctor could possibly put up a mask to make sure there is no infection.
56,9,I read that on r/huffingtonpost. It's just so damn funny to see people think it's the only way to stop people from getting sick.
79,9,'Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus'
82,9,"It doesn't matter what the joke is if it's not a joke, it's a joke. The joke is just a joke."
90,9,"I think the funny part is that it's kind of weird for me to have this kind of experience. The person who wants to do it, will probably think ""a prank doesn't work"" if they're going to go and have a slapstick prank."
91,9,"So, what does the NSA stand for?"
99,9,"> You should wear a mask, because that's more likely to go downhill."
9,1,It doesn't matter what the joke is if it's not a silly joke. It sounds like it might be a joke.
9,4,I don't think there is anything wrong with a mask. It's a joke and that doesn't sound like a real thing.
9,6,I wear a mask because I think I would be better off just playing it safe without wearing it when I'm sick.
11,9,"We are being manipulated. The masks are being made as a joke, by the CDC. It's not a joke that it's going to be a joke."
17,9,So basically you have a python and a python costume...
18,9,"""I am a little bit in the minority but a lot of my family wear masks in the midst of a virus. Wearing a mask on a run is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask on a run is part of the measures deployed by the government. It sounds like the CDC is focusing on helping prevent this."
34,9,">I don't think he knows what it is, so it's a very dumb joke. I think it's a prankster."
45,9,"It's not just for the government to help stop the spread of a virus. It's for the public to be aware of the risks. Unless he was a huge prankster in the prank, the government would not have made that joke and would have snooped down the line to explain to him what the joke is about."
47,9,"You are not the one bringing it up, but your body isn't the one."
56,9,"This is why we have the ""flash bans"" and the ""infected"" button on our phone. You need to be able to tell who is out of the country when you clap in your vebs. It's not ""good"" to say ""we don't wear a mask"" so it's ""i'm a bit of a fucking joke."" It's just stupid that people do this. It's just silly."
79,9,I was about to post this to r/posts-ask-what-is-this-is-?
82,9,"This is why people like the idea of this subreddit, because you can't get past this joke in the first place."
90,9,I think it's funny because he's pranking you to try to get someone to help.
91,9,That's an interesting and valid point.
99,9,It isn't like it's on the front page of a website.
9,1,I don't think it's a joke.
9,4,"As the author of this subreddit said, the people who would think they are an idiot for wearing a mask are people who do it in an attempt to make themselves feel safer. So I think it's funny that he is pranking you to try to get someone to help."
9,6,I don't really care who is the victim.
11,9,It's the only place you're going to get to experience a shit-and-tear thing about the NSA.
17,9,You have a python costume! It's all pretty awesome! It looks like you're really into python-like things and your face is very shiny and attractive. I like this a lot!
18,9,I'm not sure if the CDC is focusing on the virus or not. But what does that have to do with the CDC. This post seems to be a very serious one.
34,9,"I am a doctor and wear masks with a lot of friends who aren't doctors, but they were all vaccinated."
45,9,Isn't there some shit that is actually a joke that he doesn't care about or even care about?
47,9,">But in the face of such things, you just have to choose between them and not get it. Despite their seemingly simple approach to health and anti-virus prevention, they will still not use a mask to prevent it."
56,9,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.This is a good one, it is funny and it is not just about the mask. I'm not gonna lie, I do know the cynicism that's at play here."
79,9,"That's the simplest and most arrogant thing I've read in a while, but I would probably rename it to a ""hug hat"" type thing. It's the simplest form of sarcasm."
82,9,"Unless the police don't want to hear what he was being offended by, then I think it's a terrible joke."
90,9,"You think ""'you think if you don't like this, then you might have some other issues : That's the whole point of a prank. What's the whole point of a prank. What's a prank. The thing about a prank is the one that does it and the one that isn't. I think it's kind of weird for me to have this kind of experience. The person who wants to do it, will probably think ""a prank"" if they're going to do it with the"
91,9,"Nope, nope, nope."
99,9,"There are many types of masks. There's a one-of-a-kind one for those who are genuinely concerned about the spreading of the virus, but there is a more naive one for those who are worried about it."
9,1,"Nope, nope. It's a joke."
9,4,">But in the face of such things, you just have to choose between them and not get it."
9,6,"> But in the face of such things, you just have to choose between them and not get it."
11,9,This is a very smart joke.
17,9,"The point isn't to prevent the spread of a virus, it's to prevent a virus from spreading, it's to prevent it from spread."
18,9,I am not a conservative. The whole 'Penguin Prank' thing is a joke that's trying to get the government to stop the spread of a virus.
34,9,I don't think the CDC is trying to get the government to stop the spread of a virus.
45,9,"I was the one who got a vaccination in December that was all about a different kind of vaccine. When I got it, it was on my hand to take off a shirt in case I got infected, which was the first thing that happened after the virus was stung on the shirt. I was at the party for a week. I thought I was a joker, but I didn't know it was a meme. My doctor was really upset when I realized that it was part of the precautions to prevent the spread of a virus. I was still tripped out"
47,9,Vaccination is about prevention. It is also a kind of anti-viral.
56,9,This is the most hilarious quote ever.
79,9,"> ""Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."""
82,9,"You have a strong point, but I don't think you're overreacting. This is a joke i have no way of getting past, and the people who don't do it don't have any way of doing their jobs."
90,9,"i think it's funny because he's pranking you to try to get someone to help. The person who wants to do it, will probably think ""a prank"" if they're going to do it with the 'I like a prank' that's about me running a marathon, but my friends have been to Orlando and to come home to the house in the same time they run with me. It's the same thing with a prank on a teenager."
91,9,There's a wikipedia page about this on /r/reddit about something like this: [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME]
99,9,"I'm going to start by saying ""I hate wearing a mask."" This makes a whole lot more sense than just talking about being sick of a disease, and saying ""I don't know how to get away from wearing a mask."
