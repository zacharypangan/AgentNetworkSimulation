84,1,You can't fuck that. You've got a face mask. That's the real problem with that.
84,5,It seems like the best thing to do is to sign up and sign the contract - then get the test.
84,7,The problem with that is that people haven't realized how important wearing a mask is in the health and safety of others. This is why people have such huge issues. It's not about the mask it's about how big and obnoxious it is to have a mask.

84,33,I'd also say that your wife is in the middle of the action.
84,42,I'd be okay with a face mask if I were your wife. I'd be okay with her having a face mask. I'd take it off and it's your wife. I'd be okay with her getting an allergy check done. Until that time you have to wear a mask. I'm not even familiar with this one and I don't know if you can get a nose.

84,10,I'm sorry to say that you've been overreacting and I hope you don't feel a lot of pain.
84,14,"I've been in the NSA and the NSA has a bad habit of putting on a mask - it's just the mask and is a nuisance. It's not like he's trying to try to sell the mask, it's a sign that he's doing something wrong."

84,20,"I'm sure you will agree with everyone else here, but your wife will still have to wear a mask."
84,21,I don't even know why the first paragraph is downvoted. I really need to read that. And you know what?
84,33,"I mean, it's not a virus, it's a medical condition and the government does not want it. This is not even a question about what you think about a person doing this. It's just an expression that people take for granted."
84,42,"And what about your wife. The fact that she doesn't even want to know what to do or why he doesn't? Is she still sick? Is she a sick person? If she's just trying to make a mental connection that doesn't work, I don't know what to do."
84,51,This seems to be a serious thing if your husband is getting this kind of bad attention for not giving you a good reason to wear a mask.
84,59,So it's a good idea to get the NSA out of the system. That's what they're doing.
84,63,"So, when I was a kid, I could tell you that if I ever needed a mask or a vaccine, I'd go through some sort of pre-natal screening. The same would apply to vaccines. This is a sort of test that I wouldn't want to take, so I'd be wearing some sort of antimicrobial mask for my work. And, on the other hand, you can wear a mask for no apparent reason."
84,67,It's the government and not your dog.
84,71,"I would like to add that you think the mask is helpful, but not a necessity based on his experience and the fact that he would rather be in a job that involves a bit of work, or doing a bit of social interaction? Because that is the sort of thing that would help you be an effective and effective agent of a virus. So that you can keep a safe and happy life with a doctor who is trained to treat you like a patient."
84,72,"I don't think he's a big nutjob but, he's not a lawyer, and you guys are not a lawyer. I'm a lawyer, and you're a nutjob."

84,5,'They are trying to stop the spread of a virus and will extort money away from the people that actually need to buy it.'
84,7,I don't get the point of wearing a mask at all.
84,10,i don't think this makes sense. I just think it seems like a really bad joke to me.
84,14,">I know my friend, the guy who asked me if I could wear a face mask, is kind of an asshole and I have no idea why I don't. I'm just afraid I could get in there."","
84,17,*Waving a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
84,20,The NSA can't force you to wear a mask when you get sick. There's an easy reason for it - that's a medical condition and the government isn't willing to take you for a virus test.
84,21,">You guys are not a lawyer, and you guys are not a lawyer."
84,33,The NSA and the NSA are robbing you of your rights in order to prevent the spread of HIV and other diseases. They are doing this to get the government out of the public health system. The NSA is acting as a big threat.

84,51,A couple of sham jokes in my post here.
84,59,This is a bit naive.
84,63,I am not a lawyer.
84,67,I don't want to have to wear a mask. But I can tell you that if you don't like the idea of that you don't want to wear a mask because it sounds uncomfortable.
84,71,"I think a lot of people are overreacting. And a lot of people are making a bad argument that he's ""a nutjob."""
84,72,"Those are a lot of common ""facts"" people make on this sub, like ""Staying the NSA safe for people that are sick"" and ""Do not revoke consent for those who are sick"" as the words used by the NSA are."
84,83,>[...I'm sorry about your rant and I hope you don't feel a lot of pain. He doesn't care about his health. He's not telling him about it. He's talking about his wife 'fear' and then using the word 'event' for the whole thing.
85,84,"I was talking about a dog that did not have a birthday and his wife said he didn't want it. The post is very similar to this one, but in the article you're more likely to see people saying they are resentful of the NSA because they aren't aware of how it works."
90,84,It is one of the things that makes me uncomfortable.
91,84,I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

84,21,"The most annoying part of the joke is that people on reddit are still not allowed to wear masks, which is probably a big enough issue to make this sub sub feel like it's a joke."
84,33,I agree that I do not care about the government. The fact that it is acting as a big threat has me confused.
84,42,>(http://www.nihilist.com/articles/38790.html) he says people who wear a mask do so because they are uncomfortable.

I think the problem isn't your health, but the fact that I've done a lot of 'events' while not working. I don't think the whole point of having a mask is the problem, but the problem is you.

84,1,The idea of a 'financial nutjob' is one I'm not interested in.
84,5,I read a lot of things relating to the NSA and the fact that it's an organization. I’m not sure where you came from. It seems like an organization that works on behalf of the public.
