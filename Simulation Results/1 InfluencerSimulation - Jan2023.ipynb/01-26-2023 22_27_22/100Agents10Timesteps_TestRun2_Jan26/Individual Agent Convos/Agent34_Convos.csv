34,20,"There is not a rule that prohibits people from running in a vaccinated condition. If you wear a mask or a non-vaccinated mask, it isn't likely that you will get sick. Vaccinations can be made out of many varying types of masks, from a simple mask to one that is completely unfit."

34,23,"So what are you wearing, and what is going to happen to those people with this virus? Are you not afraid to wear a mask for that much or your friends will just look out the window and see how you are feeling or if they can be uncomfortable?

34,32,"I'm actually going to go write a letter to whoever read it, not to me and then leave it at that. Is it the new federal rule you are talking about?"
38,34,"I like how they seem to have a statewide mask mandate, even though the person isn't exactly on board with it. I'd say a statewide mask mandate and a statewide mask mandate are the same thing, and that doesn't necessarily make people happy."
47,34,You have a good point and your friend is the one who made it.
54,34,"IMO you should wear a mask for a long run, because you can do it with a lot of help, not for the whole run. If you're not comfortable with it, then wear a mask."

67,34,I have an MRSA infection.

34,12,"That's pretty funny and the fact that you are comparing a woman to a man is telling me you are a naive man and have a problem, not a woman to go to the party."
34,20,Is this the first time someone said this??
34,21,You should be wearing a mask and using the same slack that the CDC is using to stop the spread of a virus.
34,23,"A bit of background, yes. I am the only one who would be uncomfortable in a mask because I don't wear it. I also have a bad experience running on dirt and being a mess."
34,24,"This is what I always wore when I was young. It was a huge deal for me, especially considering my skin wasn't completely protected until a certain point."

47,34,> I've just been going to see a video of my buddy in a mask and she has it on
54,34,You are using a different version of the post than you were using the other version of the article.
60,34,Wearing a mask and bend over means you are trying to stop it from spreading.
67,34,Is there a CDC-endorsed safety protocol for making your skin visible when you wear a mask?
75,34,"""I can't wear a mask"" is a word used in many different contexts. This is a fucking joke - and they should be ashamed of it. Vaccination is a very good thing, but it should be a very small part of protecting the population."
100,34,"Its like saying ""you're a man and I want to know the answer to your question. I'm just going to give you some examples of what I am thinking: I am a man, and I am a man."""
34,2,"We need a vaccine to stop the spread of viruses, right?"
34,9,This article is one of the greatest articles I've ever read.
34,11,"> ""We are looking forward to an update with the CDC about the effectiveness of this legislation. Isn't wearing a mask part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
34,12,[We should be wearing a mask and using the same slack that the CDC is using to stop the spread of a virus.
34,20,"Is there a CDC-endorsed safety protocol for making your skin visible when you wear a mask? ""I can't wear a mask"" is a word used in many different contexts."
34,21,That is exactly what the article was supposed to say.
34,23,We need a better solution to a disease like papilloma.
34,24,"So, I can understand how you're saying this."
34,32,"I think it's called the ""Pretty Important Rule."""
38,34,"""I don't get a statewide mask mandate and I hate the fact that they cut education funding."""
47,34,"So what's the point of wearing a mask when people are sick and trying to find out who to vaccinate? 'As long as you can stay in contact, then we're done.'"
54,34,"He doesn't have the right to do it. His comment is the one to start, not a troll."
60,34,You've got your own reason for this.
67,34,"Why do we even need a mask? I am a CDC specialist and have had a CDC infection, so I'm pretty sure we don't need one."
75,34,"It's a huge problem. I'm sure that's why people want to get their face checked on and to see their own bodies. There's no 'no' in there, not enough room for me to be in the party. It is a huge problem, and not a joke."
100,34,I walked around wearing a mask.
34,2,"We need a vaccine to stop the spread of viruses, right?"
34,9,I'd be willing to bet the CDC and the CDC are on to something.
34,11,What’s the point of wearing a mask when people are sick and trying to find out who to vaccinate?

34,20,I'm sure we have some form of mask if we want to prevent the spread of viruses in the future.

34,23,"I don't know how you feel about this comment. I think it's called the ""Pretty Important Rule."""
34,24,"I'm gonna come out on top a few years ago and say that ""You have a problem,"" and you should go talk to the CDC about how to help the situation. That's just not true."
34,32,They want a vaccine that prevents the spread of a virus. They want a statewide mask mandate to stop the spread.
38,34,"I think it's a joke, especially because there are a lot of people whose masks they don't wear despite having a papilloma to protect themselves."
47,34,"As a guy who wore a mask when he travelled to visit a hospital (or even just at his house) he was referring to a man who would wear a mask to get infected while traveling. The ""covi"" is the one that's the biggest saboteurs (and therefore, the fucking ones who are saboteurs)."
54,34,Is a mask not part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus?
60,34,I'm in the Army and I do have a rash every time I'm out in public i'll go out and do stuff like that. Wearing a mask and bend over means you are trying to stop it from spreading.
67,34,The CDC does not mandate you to wear a mask to get vaccinated.
75,34,CANNOTANSWER: Is it a prank - what kind of prank is it? Is it a prank that you are referring to?
100,34,I think a mask is one of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
34,2,"If a person was a CDC Specialist and had a CDC infection, he would have been vaccinated and his husband would have had the same situation. But since this was an actual CDC memo from the early 1990s, that's just a guess."
34,9,"I am not a scientist, but I do have a papilloma, which is a serious, serious disease."
34,11,"This isn't an official word, it's just a common joke."
34,12,I'm not a doctor.
34,20,"I'm afraid I'm being off-balance by being a prankster. I feel bad for the CDC, and for a lot of the other things that I know from the CDC."
34,21,"There are a lot of pranks that are in the CDC, they do not use them, and there are people who do."
34,23,"So I... have a bunch of people like this talking about the government making a mask to fight off the spread of viruses, right?"
34,24,"I believe it's a joke, I'm a CDC Specialist, but it's not a prank. I think it's not even a prank."
34,32,"You know that you've been in this position since it first aired and you're currently the director of public health and this doc is not going to get a full job. It's a joke. It's a joke.... and you are saying ""We need a vaccine to stop the spread of viruses,"" and you are not being serious."
38,34,"The first part is the omission of the quote. He's not saying he's not in the US, but he's saying he's in the US and there's a lot of federal funding going into helping a government contractor."

60,34,I can't wear a mask on a day. It feels like a huge deal.

75,34,"I don't think he knows what it is, so it's a very dumb joke."
100,34,I have no clue how to interpret that.
34,2,">I don't think he knows what it is, so it's a very dumb joke."
34,9,I think it's a prank. I have a few comments like this that I've never heard before. They're all very serious.

34,12,"They are a joke. They said that people with the disease, and not everyone can get it, have been vaccinated and therefore not vaccinated, so it's a very dumb joke."
34,20,It's just a prank. People have no idea what it is.
34,21,"This is a lot like the CDC's memo that says, ""We need a vaccine to stop the spread of viruses."" It says, ""We need a vaccine to stop the spread of viruses."" But there is nothing to the joke that says ""Pah-ph-ah-ph-h-ph-ph-md."
34,23,You aren't being a prankster.
34,24,"""We are looking forward to an update with the CDC about the effectiveness of this legislation."""
34,32,I can’t believe this article is misleading...
38,34,"I hate the government - but I would love to be able to help people who need help with things like vaccines. I think the government is inefficient and they should stop making the jokes for a better time, or at least help people who don't know about it."
47,34,The NSA's inaction has nothing to do with the fact that the CDC doesn't actually have a way of stopping the spread of a virus. They're going to use this idea as a smear campaign to get more people sick. That's why they do things like that.
54,34,You guys are shady.
60,34,"Wearing a mask while sick and breaking a skin barrier, and bending it over, is really the only way to get a vaccine."
67,34,"The guy says that the NSA is trying to help me and that the guy is just trying to help me, but he's not letting you do whatever he wants."
75,34,What? We're talking about the CDC.
100,34,"... I think it is more like saying, ""If you get sick you will be infected."""

34,11,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
34,12,"This is a lot like the CDC's memo that says, ""We need a vaccine to stop the spread of viruses."" It says, ""We need a vaccine to stop the spread of viruses."""
34,20,[NAME]: I don't know any more. I can't believe the CDC is using the same jokes to get more people sick. I think it's a joke.
34,21,I like how they're going to make this a lot of jokes because it's like they have been using a mask for so long that they will never get a response.
34,23,"I think this one is a little less funny than others, because I'm pretty sure the guy in the middle said he's never worn a mask, or even thought it was the only way to stop the spread of this illness."
34,24,"I'm trying to figure out what the CDC and their staff would like to hear if it is a prank. This is just a joke, they aren't making the jokes they're making."
34,32,It's a joke and you are not being serious.
38,34,Is the government doing their job well? There are so many ways to get money back a government contractor is just a joke. It's not the same as a joke.
47,34,"This is an interesting point. I’ve just been vaccinated with a CDC vaccination, and I was fine, as long as it wasn’t wearing a mask and infected with it, I wasn’t even able to wear a mask at all."
54,34,A mask can be used to stop people from spitting viruses and even to try to spread them through the feces and blood vessels.
60,34,I have no idea what it is or how it works. I'm a little bit in the minority but a lot of my family wear a mask in the midst of a virus. Vaccination is the quickest and most effective cure for a virus. It works great when I'm not in the flu. I'm a doctor. The Doctor knows I'm a doctor and has an issue with it. The Doctor will tell you that you want to wear a mask.
67,34,I do not believe that it's a joke. It's basically saying that someone is invading your personal health.
75,34,What if you're not going to a party with a house full of pythons? Are they not having a pandemic?
100,34,You're a very funny person.
34,2,"The CDC has actually been telling us that as they get more vaccines, there will be more people infected by the virus."
34,9,"I am a doctor and wear masks with a lot of friends who aren't doctors, but they were all vaccinated."
34,11,"The CDC is making a joke and then attempting to put a mask on your head, or worse, he has a mask that he is actually using to stop you from getting sick and getting sick and a mask will be able to take you to a doctor for the next three months so you can get vaccinated for your own medical reasons. I don't know what they're talking about, but you're a very funny person."
34,12,This is a joke based on the fact that you are trying to get the government to stop the spread of a virus.
34,20,I think the only joke I get out of this is that the CDC has some form of safety protocol where you can be seen by a mask. I like it because it's easy to get sick and the CDC knows everything about it.
34,21,"If someone has a sick person in their family, it is a prank."
34,23,">I think it's called the ""Pretty Important Rule."""
34,24,I like how the CDC is using the same jokes to get more people sick. I think it's a joke.
34,32,"They're putting some very dumb, very stupid jokes in here."
38,34,I'd like to add that I know some people who do a mask in order to stop the spread of the virus. I don't really like that the government doesn't cut their funding either.
47,34,"I feel like I could have made this joke just fine. I don’t care for masks and don’t like wearing one. But if I could, I would."
54,34,There's nothing in this article about how a mask works - that it's a good idea but not what people actually want.
60,34,This is just a joke and the doctor isn't a politician. He's talking about a doctor's question.
67,34,"I think you should see a doctor who is trained to make the effort to keep the public safe. Vaccination is a right and a responsibility, but there’s no moral requirement to make people who aren’t vaccinated be vaccinated."
75,34,So is this a prank? Because it's a prank. It's the government's way of ensuring the spread of a virus and whatnot.

34,2,"Isn't this actually about being a doctor? Because I don't think so, and I don't think it's a joke."
34,9,I don't think the CDC is trying to get the government to stop the spread of a virus.
34,11,"I am so sick of cdc people. I love the CDC. I am scared of what could happen. I know that. It's just not a joke. But I have never thought of them as a joke, I've never imagined a government that made a joke about that kind of behavior."
34,12,>I think the only joke I get out of this is that the CDC has some form of safety protocol where you can be seen by a mask. I like it because it's easy to get sick and the CDC knows everything about it.
34,20,You can't be a prankster and still get sick. We do not use masks. We need the money.
34,21,I know a lot of people who wear masks but they don't want to get into the hands of the people they want to prevent a pandemic.
34,23,The CDC is making a joke. They are putting this joke in this thread because they think people are using it as a way to stop the spread of a virus.
34,24,"I think I'm going to have to give the CDC a call, but I would have to give it to you if I thought it was a joke."
34,32,"So, it's just a prank? Because it's a prank. I think you should see a doctor who is trained to make the effort to keep the public safe. Vaccination is a right and a responsibility, but there’s no moral requirement to make people who aren’t vaccinated be vaccinated. So is this a prank? Because it’s the government’s way of ensuring the spread of a virus and whatnot."
38,34,People can get sick when they get infected.
47,34,"Yeah, you're being very clever here, but I want you to know this:"
54,34,I think that it's a very small part of the problem and why people think it's funny.
60,34,I’m not a doctor. I’m a doctor. I’m a doctor.
67,34,"Vaccination is a right, it's a moral obligation, and I think a doctor should be able to make the right decision."
75,34,I think that you are overly critical of the CDC.
100,34,"This isn't just a joke - this is a story about someone who actually wears a mask in order to hide their identity. I have heard of this story too. This is not a joke, but this is a story about one of our kids. It is in the title and it is actually a joke, but its also not a joke, and it is a joke. It is a joke and not a joke. It is not a joke, but a joke. And it is also a shit joke for the people around it to say"
