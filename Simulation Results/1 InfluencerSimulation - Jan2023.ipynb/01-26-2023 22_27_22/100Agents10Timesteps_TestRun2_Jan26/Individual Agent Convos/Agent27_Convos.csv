27,16,The video is the best in the world for a joke
42,27,No. What's wrong with a helmet when you haven't been tested to be vaccinated? A helmet is a part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

27,5,It's not exaggeration. The point of a mask is not to make the government think they should stop the spread of a disease. It's to be used in ways that prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS. I've come to the conclusion that the government is making it more appropriate to prevent the spread of a virus by smearing them on people who do not think they need to.
27,16,"Apparently the government is trying to bring out a new definition of ""mask"", and the government is trying to push back against it."

63,27,"A lot of doctors, doctors, and researchers have a cult of religious delusion that can't seem to keep up with their science because of the CDC, but don't think that's what it is. The government uses masks to stop the spread of a virus."
64,27,I'm not sure why everyone has had a mask but it's part of the joke he's using to make people think they don't have any respect for the environment and it's kind of a dick move. It's just an issue in a lot of cases and it's a way for the public to be open about it.
73,27,> The government isn't doing anything to stop the spread of AIDS. It sounds like that's the biggest issue on the planet with this.
74,27,I have a very high understanding of the concept of a mask. I've always believed that if someone had a mask they would actually wear it. I have not felt anything like that since being a person without a mask - they've seen nothing but their friends with masks who do not wear them.

78,27,It is really a good idea.
99,27,"I like the quote ""A guy wearing a mask isn't going to do anything good."" It is not something I'd want to do but rather it's something I have to do. Hopefully, that's what happens if he wears a mask on Christmas Eve or at Christmas."

73,27,You're probably going to be a little more confused about these.
74,27,Is it possible that people are wearing masks? I don’t see why you would wear a mask in public. I just want to let people know you’re not trying to stop the spread of a virus.
78,27,I shave my head while on the road and never use the word shave.
99,27,I don't know what I could do without a mask on the night of Christmas if someone is in the hospital. Then I guess I'm wearing a mask for the holidays instead.
