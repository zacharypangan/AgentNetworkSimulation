83,37,those who want to protect themselves from getting sick have every right to masks keep you more safe than no mask in tight settings everyone has the right to do whatever they want now at their discretion
85,37,a special shout out goes to mr londono and ms latorre we loved the teachable moment of mask wearing and addressing covid questions also a very happy birthday to our vebbulldog jamya
95,37,we keep hearing about how most kids quickly recover from covid pretty hard to recover from this wear a mask and if you can get vaccinated
100,37,really interesting in light of people s resistance to wear a mask both the mask and the shopping cart are measurements of empathy
37,6,i hate that the whole world isn't sane enough for the government to cut education funding.
37,10,He has a pretty awesome attitude towards the kids that he tries to push through a mask mandate.
37,12,What’s that “We have the right to do whatever we want in tight settings everybody has the right to do”?
37,13,"This has a whole slew of sexy connotations, even in the context of politics and political rhetoric. The one thing that people say is I don't think he's in the state he lives in is that he's not wearing a mask when there is a virus."

37,26,I was a doctor that was the only person in the state I knew who had a virus. I never got to see him for anything except a mask. I thought I was the first to ask him about that but then he told me he needed a statewide mask and I was fine with it.
37,36,"There is not much they can do about the cost of vaccines, but it does give you a lot of information about statewide mask mandates."
56,37,"Yes, I agree with you. There are a lot of ways to protect yourself in America. I would have to work harder for myself."
83,37,"I'm in a small hospital right now, and wearing a mask doesn't have any effect on your safety."
85,37,"And yet, she is wearing her mask on the day of her birthday, so..."

100,37,"I believe in a lot of things, people who have never heard of the ''walking mask '' and then put on a mask are a bunch of people who didn't even understand what was going on, and people who never saw the mask were actually people who had not yet seen the mask in their daily lives."
37,6,"I agree with the whole post, but I'm going to argue it's only because of that. The best way to protect yourself is to get vaccinated."
37,10,I don't know. I'm trying to be very honest about this - I was just wondering if you know what I mean by that. I gotta be real!
37,12,i don’t know. i don’t know what the statewide mask mandate actually means. they’re just laws.
37,13,[NAME] is a lawyer.
37,16,"Basically this guy is going to have to be vaccinated by the time he's cured, but that's just my opinion and doesn't really matter to the person."
37,26,"I had this question before, how does it work? How is it the government that mandates the masks?"
37,36,"And yet, she is wearing her mask on the day of her birthday, so..."
56,37,"I hate to be an agnostic and anti-vaccination anti-virus advocate, but I know it's a very important thing."
83,37,"I've had my first child wear a mask on a regular basis, but after several days it doesn't seem to have a lasting effect."
85,37,Almost like people are going to buy a hammer that can just be worn on their birthday. I had a friend come out and say that they wear a mask all the time and it is actually actually kind of a joke.
95,37,"I like to put on a mask and bend over to prevent someone else from putting on a mask. Vaccination, and a mask can be very effective in preventing a virus in humans from causing cancer in humans. I don't like to wear a mask and bend over to prevent a virus from being transmitted."

Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
37,6,It's like the government is the government's boss when it comes to getting a new mask in the country.
37,10,I cried last week because I wore a mask in my bathroom and walked down the hallway. I don't like to wear a mask.
37,12,"Is the state government liable for the cost of the statewide mask mandate? Or is it a law, like the state of Tennessee?"
37,13,"In this case, the person is going to have to be vaccinated for a month before she can begin to develop a virus."

37,26,"I am not a lawyer, I am a lawyer. It is not. I am not a lawyer, but I can help you."
37,36,"It sounds like you need to go to your doctor and see if your child is getting vaccines or not. This is not a government-funded initiative, it is part of the government-funded initiative. It's more like a federal health care system, or a state based one."
56,37,">I don't see how a person can say you don't want to be vaccinated unless they know what they're doing, especially since they aren't getting it done properly. I’m just glad to see that I’m wearing a mask in the holidays and that it’s only really the same as the masks, just not the same."
83,37,"I've had a patient on the same list for years, and only had one infection (the CDC and NIH), and then I was on it, for weeks at most, and it's been all over the place for two years. They said I have no issue with it, but I don't think I've ever been hurt in anything."
85,37,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. The vebb has a lot of problems with its behaviour.

You can't help it, do it and have fun. You can't help it when you have to, but you can help it when you need to."
100,37,...I think the real problem with wearing a mask is that it doesn't really address the issue that is spreading. It's that it's more important than knowing a person's actual place of existence.
37,6,Vaccination is a very important and important component in preventing an infection and preventing the spread of the virus.
37,10,>I don't like to wear a mask and bend over to prevent someone else from putting on a mask.
37,12,"You know, I've been sick and immobile since I was 11."
37,13,"I'm a lawyer, so it's important to understand that it doesn't matter that your child isn't getting the vaccine. There is no mandate to vaccinate her as soon as possible. In addition, if she doesn't get vaccinated, she won't be able to get the vaccine."
37,16,"It's the right thing to do, and I don't think it's worth it to have a person in a hospital, because you can't make people say their health is better. I don't think the person who wears a mask is the person that is getting sick."
37,26,You're not a lawyer. It's a law. You're not an anti-virus advocate.
37,36,"The statewide mask mandate seems very important to me. I'm not a lawyer, but my wife's mother is."
56,37,It's not just a joke. It's the truth.
83,37,"It's a big deal, but it's important that the CDC and the NIH know how to use a mask and make sure they don't damage someone else's health."
85,37,Wearing a mask on your birthday doesn't prevent the spread of a virus. It's a temporary solution that people find inappropriate for their pets and may end up with an even larger problem than a normal dog.
95,37,We do not have a new policy against wearing a mask. We have a new policy against wearing a mask. It's a big one and we will do it soon.

37,12,I'm a lawyer. I can help you.
37,13,"It's just a big problem, and it's going to be pretty hard to see how things are going to get more dangerous in a short amount of time. I'm not a lawyer, but I'm sure people will want to try to harrass them."
37,16,"This is a good point, but one of the main points is that you've blown it out of proportion with what they've said in the past."
37,26,This is the same'mandate' that Obama used in his presidential campaign. That's when he decided to go to the government instead of the doctors. That's when the NIH would do their own thing to block everyone who wears masks.
37,36,It sounds like he's trying to help people get vaccines and not do it. He's trying to help people get the vaccine. He's trying to get the vaccines but he's not a lawyer. He's trying to work on a project that involves working on a vaccine but doesn't really help a little.
56,37,"In my country, you don't get a virus vaccine. You get an HIV infection vaccine, but it is also an influenza b.

83,37,"I can't see the difference in health between a mask and a fecal disease, especially if it's actually in your head. But the point is it's not a mask. It's an inhaler or air mask. The fact that a doctor will cut you out of the fecal infection can indicate that you're infected. The point is that if the doctor doesn't think there's any harm in the fecal disease, he has to have it because he knows, but that's all that matters."
85,37,"> We don't wear a mask on my birthday, because I don't feel like my vebb would be in a place of comfort or safety. If I wear a mask on my birthday, I want my husband to be around, he's not my dog and I want to avoid getting sick of him in case he has a vebbb and I have problems."
95,37,Vaccination and a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
100,37,"People who don't know what a walking mask is are weird. I know some people who do that, but I don't know where the term for it is from. I know the description for it is a little bit misleading....I think the real problem with wearing a mask is that it doesn't really address the issue that is spreading. It's that it's more important than knowing a person's actual place of existence. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
37,6,I have a big vesical infection.
37,10,"What's going on here is not to mention how sick the country is, it is to prevent the spread of disease, and to try to prevent other people from doing it."
37,12,"I don't know what I mean, but I know some people who wear a mask on their birthday. And some that wear a mask on their family to protect themselves, and some who have the money to buy a mask."
37,13,Isn't it the fact that you have to wear a mask while you are in the hospital? Because that's a bad idea.
37,16,"I'm not sure how many people could have done this before. I just think the entire situation is pretty bad. I've heard that even if I have a job, I don't think it's a good idea for me to do that. I don't have a lot of experience with it, but I also don't think it's worth it to have a job in a state that's the least dangerous place I can find that I know is safe."
37,26,"This is why we have a statewide mask mandate. I'm assuming he's not a doctor, but a doctor who hasn't given any medical advice to you. The whole ""I am not a lawyer, I am a lawyer. It is not. I am not a lawyer, but I can help you."" quote came from [N.Y.C.]. The point is that it's a big deal, but it's important that the CDC and the NIH know how to use a mask and make sure they don't"
37,36,It doesn't address the issue. It's more important than knowing someone's actual place of existence.
56,37,I love the word mask. This is why a mask is a joke.
83,37,"The CDC and NIH have already implemented a system that requires the use of a mask on an unprotected patient, and then sends them to the hospital to be re-certified to wear a mask after a fever comes up. The fact that a mask doesn't have any effect on the child is really scary."
85,37,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

100,37,You're talking about the problem of wearing a mask when you're trying to talk about people wearing a mask in order to show them that they have a valid point of view on the matter. I've never understood that.
37,6,"This is the real question, and it is not a question about if they want to or do not have a proper policy on how to handle it."
37,10,I'm really sorry but that's not my situation. Having a bad day isn't a bad thing and I really feel like I have to go to the doctor.
37,12,He’s trying to stop a virus from spreading. It’s not about what to say. The people who wear it are trying to protect themselves and their family from viruses.
37,13,"Yes, it's a bad idea. Vaccination and masks are part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
37,16,It is not really the same thing as a medical advice.
37,26,"I like you for this. Basically speaking a lot of people don't even know what a mask is. It sounds like you're trying to help people get a vaccine, and you don't know what it's about. That's a great way to deal with a rash and be able to have a conversation with people about how to prevent it. This is a good way to have people talk about the rash, but the point is that it's more important than knowing someone's actual place of existence."

56,37,People want to be protected from diseases. They want the right to die.
83,37,"It's a good idea, but it's not really the right thing to do."
85,37,"I'm really sorry to hear this, but I was able to get away with a nice one:"

100,37,"Wearing a mask in the middle of the day, you could have a really bad time."
37,6,Vaccination isn't what the CDC or NIH wants to do. They've already done it. A mask can prevent a virus.
37,10,"It was a joke! I love it. It’s so easy to have it wrong, but it doesn’t help at all. The only reason I ever do that is to protect my family and get them to wear a mask. It has no idea what it means or what it means or what the government wants them to do. I just don’t care about what the public is seeing and what the government needs for that. It’s more important than knowing someone’s place of existence. I just don’t like it. I’m sure he doesn’t want to give him the benefit"

37,13,I would love to hear how the CDC and NIH are not going to protect a child from HIV and it is a great idea. They are going to want a mask of a vaccine that stops the spread of a virus. That's all.
37,16,"There's a difference between a simple sex ad, a rash ad and a rash ad in general."
37,26,You can tell the difference between a doctor with a mask and a doctor with a mask. You just tell the difference between a doctor and a doctor. There is no difference between the two.
37,36,I'm not sure how people get away with a nice one:
56,37,"[CNN] (http://www.cnn.gov/public/topics/dicks/dicks-comments-seniors-to-infectious-virus) has found an interesting, and often disproven, way to prevent sickening the people living in these areas."
83,37,In California I have a problem with my helmet. I feel so vulnerable. My dentist will give me one because I feel sick and it will cause some serious trouble if I don't know how to use a mask correctly. In my state the doctors may have to use gloves but the meds on the patients may be better suited to the person.
85,37,It was a joke. That was actually funny.
95,37,There is a movie called Mask and Wearing. It combines the two parts of a 'Mask and Wear'.
100,37,"I read that as ""if you get sick you will be infected."""
37,6,[((CNN))) ((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((())))))))))))))). ((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((
37,10,That's hilarious. I've heard this one before:
37,12,I'm not a doctor. I'm a doctor. It's an opinion. And a joke. I have no idea what the CDC is talking about. Is it possible that a doctor is trying to keep people from getting HIV because of a vaccine? Is that a joke? Is this a joke? Does it make any sense that the person that's promoting HIV is wearing a mask to help keep people from getting HIV because of it? Or is there some sort of thing they're talking about?
37,13,"A good point, but one of the main points is that you've blown it out of proportion with what they've said in the past."
37,16,"I've never heard a doctor say ""I don't think it's worth it to have a person in a hospital, because I don't think the person who wears a mask is the person that is getting sick."""

37,36,[Did a doctor ever give you a mask in his home state?](https://www.cnn.gov/public/topics/dicks/dicks-comments-seniors-to-infectious-virus) is a great piece of shit.
56,37,"The first sentence is a joke. The second sentence is not a joke. The first sentence is a joke. It sounds like there's some kind of ""serious"" point of view in there but I don't think that's an obvious point."
83,37,"That's really scary. There are so many things you can do that you might not feel comfortable using a mask, because the doctors are too busy treating sick people and they have to put more effort into it."
85,37,"Why does a dog want a mask on her birthday? Does the vebb get sick from the hat being slapped in the face with a mask? I don't think you've got anything to jive with. If your husband feels comfortable with a hat on his birthday, that's fine, because it's your dog."

37,12,If someone wears a mask on their birthday they will get sick. If they're not using a mask to protect themselves they'll get sick too. If they don't they will get sick. If they're not using a mask they'll get sick.
37,13,"In a different story, the doctor who wore the mask blew it out of proportion."
37,16,"Despite this joke, I don't think any of it is valid. There is something in here where a doctor is not doing anything to stop the spread of a virus. And then I hear that the mask is not a joke because the people that are infected are the ones that aren't infected."
