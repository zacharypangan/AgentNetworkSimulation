98,16,I think that is a great answer :)
16,1,"My grandfather wears the mask to protect against viral infections, but after a while I did not wear a mask. He was a doctor and was probably cured of it. I don't think he ever took any precautions to prevent it."
16,2,I would like to suggest that you go with an AIDS/AIDS mask and a t-shirt.
16,10,"I've seen the documentary 'The Infectious Disease Crisis,' which starred Brad Pitt and John Stewart. I like how you're in for a surprise here."
21,16,I would want to know how to wear a mask.

48,16,The NSA has an awful reputation for making mistakes and ignoring them.
52,16,I have been having trouble swallowing a banana since childhood.
53,16,The most important part of the conversation is the wording.
61,16,"When I was young, I was always scared of going into the grocery store with a large slob in my face, but it just felt so odd. I got a lot of attention from parents on the side of the street, but not enough to really have any respect for my family's safety."
62,16,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
93,16,"If you put yourself at risk for some kind of disease, you have a good chance of getting a virus."
98,16,The other half is the one with Jack starring Michael Bay.
16,1,>He explains how to do this.
16,2,That is a joke about being too scared to wear a mask.
16,10,I think the wording on the film is pretty misleading. I'm not sure how he's going to get the AIDS/AIDS virus a long time after the movie came out. I would like to know how to wear a mask. A great way to show that we love our neighbors so they have enough compassion for our friends to do so.
21,16,"It's also part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.Go for it, then come on and let me know how it goes."

53,16,"We should do the same thing when we work in a group of people. In the American context, I think that the fact that people have to wear a mask during the day can be helpful in keeping a person from getting a cold. It's because we don't eat and drink from our masks. I don't eat the food we use, but I do get the food we use in it."
61,16,I don't understand why people don't wear a mask. I don't understand why people have a bad habit of doing it.
62,16,People seem to like wearing a mask and not want to think about how nice it is for their health.
93,16,There's a funny thing I learned from this story in a scavenger hunt.

35,16,">I mean I wouldn't call my job because I'm in the military. I'd say it's part of what they do to prevent the spread of a virus. So it's an important safety feature. And you think people have a right to wear a mask. I've got a mask on and I need to go up to it, I'm not wearing it because it doesn't look nice. It is a security issue."
37,16,"It's the right thing to do, and I don't think it's worth it to have a person in a hospital, because you can't make people say their health is better. I don't think the person who wears a mask is the person that is getting sick."
41,16,"'Making a mask to stop the spread of a virus is very disrespectful to the public and the public, so if I were you I'd have to put off wearing one."
48,16,> I'm a lawyer and I wore a mask. I've heard that the answer is : But you don't want to be vaccinated?
52,16,"""I had a hammer on my face before I got it in the first place."

27,16,"Apparently the government is trying to bring out a new definition of ""mask"", and the government is trying to push back against it."
35,16,I'm in the army and I'm not sure what is going on here.
37,16,"This is a good point, but one of the main points is that you've blown it out of proportion with what they've said in the past."
41,16,I don't think I could do this without the government doing it. I'm a doctor and don't wear masks for the holidays and I'd love to get the Vaccine for my kids.
48,16,"This guy has got some issues he could have had in his life, like when he had to get a full set of clothes from his friends, and had to wear a mask and a vest to get around his work on the job. This is also where he got to get his job in a few months."
52,16,"I think the best way to stop that is to keep a hat on, like a santa and wearing a mask together."

21,16,">I think it is a good idea to wear a mask, especially if you don't have any experience with it."
26,16,I like to see all of the comments about the CDC and Obama on there. It's amazing that the people of the United States have a policy that only prevents people from having vaccines. They aren't all the same.
27,16,I'd like to think it's funny that a government movie doesn't say anything about the idea of a mask that might have some effect.
35,16,...but I don't know how to get a doctor or a doctor to say I wear a mask?
37,16,"I'm not sure how many people could have done this before. I just think the entire situation is pretty bad. I've heard that even if I have a job, I don't think it's a good idea for me to do that. I don't have a lot of experience with it, but I also don't think it's worth it to have a job in a state that's the least dangerous place I can find that I know is safe."
41,16,Vaccination is about prevention. We need to be more proactive about preventative health.
48,16,People should be safe as long as they aren't going to get HIV in their bodies.
52,16,What's it all about? You haven't been around a virus - you aren't going to get a virus.
53,16,I'm a physician. I have a mask and I wear it every day and not much else. I have to use it every day to be safe.
61,16,"""I'm not sure if you've heard this before or not, but I have always been scared of getting a cigarette to help with my hives. I can't help you, because if you're going to be with a girl with a slob on the front I'm going to be afraid of being eaten on the back of the car and a slob in my face. I can't really speak to that, but I've never been around the cockroaches that I have no clue what's going on."
62,16,"It seems that some people do like to wear masks, but some people don't even care about them. The government and the people themselves should be able to help prevent or eliminate this problem, if that's what you want to hear."

61,16,"It's one of those things I don't understand why people don't wear a mask. I don't know if it's a joke or not, but I can't really explain why people wouldn't wear it in any way, just a bunch of other things."

27,16,It seems like there's a lot of disagreement here - and I'm just pointing out that I don't know the answer to the first few. You're not a doctor.

52,16,"A big piece of advice I learned in college was to never wear a mask, it can actually help prevent infection.
