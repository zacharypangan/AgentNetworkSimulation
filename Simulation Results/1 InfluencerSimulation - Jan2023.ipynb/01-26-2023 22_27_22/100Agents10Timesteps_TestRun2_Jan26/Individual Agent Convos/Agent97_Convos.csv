101,97,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
97,10,It's not that easy to tell if a virus is infected or not. What the government does is pretty useless. And I would not wear a mask if I was infected :)

97,88,"Wearing a mask can actually help stop a virus. So it's the only way for someone to go through this, and is also very useful."
101,97,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
97,10,Wearing a mask helps prevent the spread of a virus.
97,18,"In a sense, the idea of a mask as the protective mechanism of defense against viruses that have spread has been brought up."
97,19,I think that is a really good point. I think it also means that you have to wear a mask. That's not just wearing a mask but actually going from one person to another.
97,20,You could wear a syringe while getting a lot of ticks. It's a bit more complicated than that.
97,44,"I'm a man and I wear a mask, but I still wear a mask. I don't wear a mask anymore, so I'm not a part of it."

If it's not dangerous to take off, I'll give him a good, good mask. And if he doesn't have one, I'll give him a good one. Having a good one does not prevent the spread of a virus, it's not the most effective, effective thing that actually prevents it."
97,88,"The idea that wearing a mask is needed is that we have no way to stop the spread of the virus. We don't know if there is something infected, we know when it is infected and if it's infected."

97,19,I thought it was a pretty good point.
97,20,I'm not sure you understand the meaning of that. Is there a difference in the meaning of it?
97,44,So I can say that this is a pretty good point.
97,47,"""When you put a mask on, it helps stop the spread of a virus,"""
97,60,It can even be a good idea to wear a mask with an open mouth.
97,80,"It's a joke and you get a joke about a good one. But it's also a joke about how your friend can do this while you're putting on a mask. I'm not sure if he has a big phobia but he has a big phobia so it's a joke and it's a joke about a hysterical joke, but the hysterical stuff seems to be a joke. That's why the joke is the only way to stop a virus."
97,88,I don't think this is a good place to start with.
101,97,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
97,10,"When I was a kid, I wore a mask to fight infections, and I had no idea it was a thing."
97,18,I'm so stoked that you gave me the reason to stop a virus.
97,19,... I don't know the meaning of it.
97,20,"I don't like a lot of sexist jokes. I don't like a lot of sexist jokes, but I would love to be a part of the virus."
97,44,I am going to assume that you are talking about a joke about a virus.
97,47,A lot of people don't care about what a virus looks like. The only thing that isn't useful is the virus.
97,60,I wore a mask to prevent a viral infection. Usually when I'm going to get sick. I went to a pharmacy and told them to bring up a mask to prevent the virus and tell them I was having an infection. They brought it up because I was scared that I would get it from someone else.
97,80,It says something about how this idea would be funny if I told you something that he does not have a phobia...
97,88,Wearing a mask prevents the spread of a virus.
101,97,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
97,10,"It is the idiomatic part, but the point here is that the government is a tyrant. This means that you must put up with the sexist jokes that they give you."
97,18,"As a fellow sexist joker, I would always be surprised when a person gets a viral infection and I try to bring up what they have and what they are saying. That's a big thing. But that does not mean they don't have an opinion."
97,19,"I think that is a really good point. I think it also means that you have to wear a mask. That's not just wearing a mask but actually going from one person to another."", ""... I don't know the meaning of it."""
97,20,... because when you put a mask on it helps stop the spread of a virus. I'm going to guess wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. I'm going to guess wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
97,44,Why are you not sure you're an idiot if your friend comes on with a joke about a virus.
97,47,"Whenever a person says that their friends don't care about what a virus looks like, they're saying, ""It's a joke and the only thing that isn't useful is the virus."""
97,60,"I don't want to go into details but this is a great place to start with. It's a joke. I have a phobia of anything that looks like a virus, and it's a joke that has little or no meaning."
97,80,People have different problems with things in different ways. Having a phobia in one or the other is a phobia and it's not useful in the other. It is a joke and it snuck in. The fact that people get sick when they wear a mask when they're at work means that they're not supposed to be sick unless they're in the hospital. I'd like to point out that masks are a fucking joke. You've never worn a mask in a phobia. But to me it's not funny
97,88,"I think the ""I'm going to guess wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."""
101,97,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
97,10,"So what do you mean ""I want to wear a mask and the sexist jokes that they give me?"""
97,18,"If you sexist jokes come up in front of your family, you get them. They are not funny. They are absurd. People that are sexist have no reason to like jokes."
97,19,I've learned a lot about the difference between a joke about people who like a joke and a joke about someone who hates it. It's very sad.
97,20,>I'm going to guess wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
97,44,"Aside from what I said there are many other jokes about men and their phobias. In my experience, the only thing a phobia has in common with women is that they don't know the purpose of the word'sick' or'sick' because they don't know if they can tell a lie. It's just one. A mask prevents the spread of a virus. A mask helps prevent the spread of a virus."
97,47,"You're going to need to stop hating a virus. I'm not going to give you a warning, but you're going to need to stop hating it."
97,60,"""Wearing a mask helps prevent the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask helps prevent the spread of a virus. It does not help in stopping the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask helps prevent the spread of a virus."""
97,80,The joke that masks are a joke has no meaning and is an idiomatic part of the lexicon.
97,88,I've been told it's a joke and it's not true.
101,97,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
97,10,"So you're saying that when you're on the street and you're thinking ""Well, I don't know why people wear a mask. But I think I'm going to go on and on and on and on. I just want to be on my knees and say I want to go on and on and on."""
97,18,"I mean, it's one of the sexist jokes. It's like if someone is going to pick up a sock and say something that doesn't even mean they're sexist, I can't believe a bunch of people actually know what a virus is. A virus doesn't look like it ain't even on it."
97,19,This is something I'm interested in learning about. It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
97,20,I know a lot of people who hate it.
97,44,"""This is quite a bit of talking nonsense, oh, no, this is just a random line from a movie."
97,47,The joke that masks are a joke has no meaning and is an idiomatic part of the lexicon.
97,60,"I'm going to say if you sexist jokes are funny in front of your family, you're not an idiot. You're going to have to make yourself uncomfortable."
97,80,I would say that people who like sexist jokes have very different feelings. This is really sad.
97,88,I hate all these sexist jokes...
101,97,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
