21,12,"I know this is kind of sad, but the message from this article is that, while you can't keep yourself protected, you still have to wear a mask.

34,12,This is a joke based on the fact that you are trying to get the government to stop the spread of a virus.
37,12,I'm not a doctor. I'm a doctor. It's an opinion. And a joke. I have no idea what the CDC is talking about. Is it possible that a doctor is trying to keep people from getting HIV because of a vaccine? Is that a joke? Is this a joke? Does it make any sense that the person that's promoting HIV is wearing a mask to help keep people from getting HIV because of it? Or is there some sort of thing they're talking about?
44,12,People have a huge problem with the government. They are not the solution. People want to be more vigilant and protect themselves. It's a good idea.
51,12,"It's not an actual joke. It's a simplest form of sarcasm. The only time someone is using a mask is if they think the CDC is doing something about it, they do a joke. They should wear a mask. A mask should prevent people from getting sick from a virus. A couple of sham jokes in my post here. Why would it be a good idea to wear a mask to keep myself safe, but I don't think that is the right way to act."
54,12,">The reason people are not getting vaccinated is because they think it is. If they are, then it is not a good idea."
58,12,I don't think they understand the issue. It sounds like a logical conclusion.
66,12,"I like the idea of wearing a mask while vaccinating my kids, but I think the entire idea is ridiculous, and it's not like there's any way it's not possible for people to wear it, and it's a prank. Basically, the problem is if you aren't a doctor, you don't even need to wear a mask, it's just a prank, and it's a prank."
75,12,"There is a lot of pranks. I guess your response is a little different from my previous comment. I don't think I have ever dated a CDC agent who didn't seem to know how to properly protect the public from pandemics. I think you should also mention that the CDC's program is intended to stop pandemics, and it's supposed to prevent pandemics, so you might see it as an extension of a prank, but also a prank and say what you have, I've been told before"
76,12,I don't think this is a joke. It's a blatant attempt to take away a virus. It's not about prevention. It's about prevention.
77,12,"In addition to all these things that were mentioned before, you also mentioned the fact that I love the word prank."
79,12,"This is how we keep up the ""mistakes""."
86,12,It's very possible that the anti-semetic drugs and anti-viral medications are to prevent the spread of these drugs.
89,12,"I think you need to read ""Dr. Johns, you will have to talk to the other guy and make a good decision about the mask,"" then you will have to say something along the lines of ""I like your idea of wearing a mask and how to do it."""
91,12,There's no one who wants to talk about the NSA and isn't going to listen.
93,12,"My boyfriend is doing a similar thing to me - he wears a mask on the run. It's hard to tell when a virus is spreading and it has a pronounced negative effect on him, which is why I'm worried about him. I don't think the government is responsible for the spread of viruses. I would rather not be wearing a mask."
96,12,[Did a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over...
21,12,That is a joke. It is about a lack of awareness and an increase in the number of people who do it. It is not a joke.
34,12,>I think the only joke I get out of this is that the CDC has some form of safety protocol where you can be seen by a mask. I like it because it's easy to get sick and the CDC knows everything about it.
37,12,If someone wears a mask on their birthday they will get sick. If they're not using a mask to protect themselves they'll get sick too. If they don't they will get sick. If they're not using a mask they'll get sick.
44,12,I'm in Texas and I have a very serious phobia of people.
51,12,The CDC is not a 'pill' thing.
54,12,"I don't want to think about the whole ""sapping virus"" thing, but I think that it is really ridiculous. You know, what's the point of a mask?"
58,12,"> I'm going to throw a funny joke in the mud: You shouldn't wear a mask on a run. It's a little hard to tell when your face isn't shattered by a virus."", ""You shouldn't wear a mask on a run. It's a little hard to tell when your face isn't shattered by a virus. The problem isn't the mask. It's the innuendo."
66,12,"""I want to tell you this, I'm not a doctor and I'm not a doctor. I want to tell you this, I'm not a doctor and I'm not a doctor."
75,12,"I think it's just a joke, a bit of a prank."
76,12,Wearing a mask helps to protect yourself. This is why I'm a big person.
77,12,People who wear a mask will wear them because they think they're going to be abused. They're still victims of snobbery and they will be killed.
79,12,"I'm so sorry, but I'm not a conservative. I am a Republican."
86,12,"The NSA is doing a lot of wrong things, but it isn't a great idea."
89,12,"It's a good way of making your friends feel good, but a bad way to bring up your own issues, and make friends that will be as happy as they can be."
91,12,The NSA does not want to eat up the time they need to have a problem with public space. They do have a problem with having people outside of their room without being allowed to wear their masks.
93,12,"If you're trying to prevent a Virus outbreak with a mask, you're actually a nutjob. The joke isn't funny, the joke isn't funny. The joke isn't funny."
