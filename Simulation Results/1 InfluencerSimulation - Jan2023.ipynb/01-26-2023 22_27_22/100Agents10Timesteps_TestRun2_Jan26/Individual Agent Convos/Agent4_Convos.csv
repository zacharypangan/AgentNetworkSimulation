101,4,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
9,4,It's in order..... Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
10,4,I will not go outside without my helmet.
11,4,"People who have never been infected should do what they can, and at least be willing to work on themselves."
45,4,"You can do whatever you want if you wear a mask. You can't just say ""yes,"" or ""no"", and not put your foot in the door because you don't want to risk your life. You have a right to do whatever you want if you don't."
47,4,i like wearing a mask because i can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows HUGE COVI fail to have santa not wearing a mask in thanksgivingdayparade would have been so powerful and such an endorsement of healthcareheroes wearamask
51,4,People who get vaccinated for a virus are oh so cool
70,4,"I also learned that masks are needed for emergency response and to help protect the public from the spread of the virus. Vaccines are not mandatory in many countries, but some will even have them."
79,4,I grew up in the country. I live in a conservative county in the states. It s a hivemind and a very small part of the country whose state is the most conservative and we have to put up with the constant mask ban and bans. I don t know why but as a californian I am quite happy with our policy.

9,4,"If I wanted to become a narcissist, I would just run around and make some noise, while wearing a mask."
10,4,The best part about wearing a mask is that it stops the spread of a virus. A lot of people don't care for what a virus looks like. The only thing that isn't useful is the virus.
11,4,"yep, they have a right to not wear a mask, but they have no right to not wear it. I like it for many reasons."
45,4,"This is a funny thread because this is why I get vaccinated, but I'm not wearing my helmet. I have been wearing a helmet for over 10 years and haven't gotten to the point where I can't even stand it."
47,4,This was written in the early 2000s and was based on an article in the 50s that compared people with masks that aren't actually the most popular in the US.
51,4,"I am not a lawyer, but I can tell you that you can wear a mask while vaccinated. But the difference is that the government doesn't need to provide protection for the people it's supposed to protect. He's a big gamer and a man with a mask. The government is just saying that the government is making a mask to stop the spread of HIV."
70,4,"A mask is not a health care system, it is not an emergency medical system. We should wear a mask in every emergency, and the CDC will not put any laws in place that prevent a virus from spreading. The CDC can't make it a ""must be vaccinated"" policy. They can make it a ""must be vaccinated"" policy, but that's not the policy here."
79,4,There are actually two different types of masks that the government would use in its fight against the spread of the virus. The most common are those which prevent the spread.
83,4,"If you aren't wearing a mask, it doesn't need to be tight, or if you aren't comfortable with it and wear it regularly."
93,4,"I want to know if people have any idea how much this is going to change in the future and if that happens, if you aren't trying, then it could go over with just being aware of how much more people are coming into our society and how much is going to be put out of their hands. I would give myself that kind of a reason."

9,4,This has essentially been a meme for years. You are a joker.
10,4,"Afaik: It's called the afaik in nyc, where a fap test is still required and that the vaccine is not mandatory for vaccinating."
11,4,"There is a very good article about this. In this case, it states that they are ineffective, but that they can do so."
45,4,"And you're referring to a very popular, well known, one that is in many countries. You probably don't know who you are, but that's where this came from."
47,4,"I feel like this is not a great discussion to have. I know a few things about what people think and don't. The 'advice' you're trying to make is a lot of jargon to me, but to me that's just plain garbage. Besides, it's not the same as being able to wear a hat or something. The 'dumbs' are actually just a bunch of jargon, but not all jargon. They're still doing their job, and even if they're wearing "
51,4,It is not a problem for most people because the government is making a mask to stop the spread of a virus. Vaccination is about prevention. We need to be more proactive about preventative health.
70,4,"I'm sure that if people don't like the CDC's plan to help vaccinate people who would do so, and they want to prevent that, they will not."
79,4,People in the US - including ours - should wear masks all the time on Thanksgiving. The government doesn't even need to have a mask on Christmas.

10,4,> I'm a doctor
11,4,Is there a medical or religious reason why people wouldn't wear a mask on a plane?
45,4,"The CDC says ""This is a funny thread because this is why I get vaccinated, but I'm not wearing my helmet. I have been wearing a helmet for over 10 years and haven't gotten to the point where I can't even stand it."" It's not a good idea, but it's a better idea. The government is trying to get people to buy vaccines, as they are not in the United States."
47,4,I think the point of wearing a mask is to avoid those two groups being able to use their force to spread the virus. It's the most ridiculous thing for humans to do.
51,4,I mean if you can't get your own health insurance you're doing better.
70,4,My name is Kate. What are you going to do with the mask? I have to get it off now.
79,4,"It's the biggest troll thread of this year, but you're a conservative and you should read up on the different types of masks used in the US government's fight against the spread of a virus."

9,4,I want to say something - like this is one of the greatest things ever written on this site.
10,4,What about a face mask? I don't even know how to wear one.
11,4,It's actually a joke. It's an article. It's written by an apologist who wrote the article. And they don't really want to answer it.
45,4,"In the US, people use a lot of masks. You see, this is about all kinds of shit. This shit is about not being in an unsanitary environment."

70,4,It's just an idea that I have no interest in going to the CDC and they're not going to get involved with it.
79,4,"In the US, masks aren't necessary. They are mandatory for a certain number of days during the year, for example. For example, the first time you wear a mask on Christmas, there's a 50 day period from New Years Eve through April 27th. When your husband wore a mask on Thanksgiving, he wouldn't get a mask because it's the only mask he wears for his Christmas shopping trips."
83,4,I can't remember if the CDC or NIH are recommending you wear a mask in public. I don't know if the article is in the public domain but this is the first time I've heard this adage.
93,4,I'd tell him to wear a mask for a long time and be patient with him. The only problem is he doesn't listen to what he wants to say.

101,4,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
9,4,I hate it when people tell me how disgusting the NSA is about the fact that it's helping prevent the spread of a virus. I haven't done anything like this since I was a child and they've really gotten sick from the shit I've done. I know they hate it so I'll be very upset because I'm an idiot because I can't even wear a mask. I'm sure the person I wrote this to probably knows more about the subject than me. I just don't think it's the government's job
10,4,Wearing a mask is a part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
11,4,"It's not a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. I see no reason to wear a mask when I'm sick and I don't even think of it as a bad thing, and a good reason to make the NSA more ineffective. This isn't a joke. It's a joke. I really don't see any reason why people shouldn't wear a mask in public when they are sick and need to know who to vaccinate."
45,4,"> [I think it's time to move on. It's about how the government protects our health - and yours, as well as the other problems the public faces with vaccines. I think it was a great one."
47,4,"I've heard a few of these things thrown around that aren't completely acceptable. One thing I see is ""Hey, it's all right"" or ""I just don't want to be a saboteur,"" which is a really terrible idea. ""I'm just pointing out that this isn't a joke"" and that there is an official list of the federal drug programs that have the capability to put people on the front lines of the federal government to get sick. It's what a lot of people feel in real life."

70,4,I don't think it's weird at all to think people actually wear a mask in emergency situations. The government isn't doing much to prevent the spread of the virus.
79,4,That's just an issue of social media.
83,4,[The media](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/raised_in_a_mamed_in_a_family_disorder) is trying to get people to stop wearing masks in public. The article says it is not part of the government's policy to stop the spread of a virus.

70,4,"> a ""little misread."""
79,4,The problem is with the lack of a uniform. If the masks aren't uniformed then it's a cliche. A nationality of a group of people could be in trouble if they did it. This is a legitimate reason to have the government ban the mask.
