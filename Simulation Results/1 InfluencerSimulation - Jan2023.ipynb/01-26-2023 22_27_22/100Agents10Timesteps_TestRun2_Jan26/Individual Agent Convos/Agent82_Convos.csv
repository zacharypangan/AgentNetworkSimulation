82,61,You know the government has had it out on you for a while.
82,80,>I have been doing my job for almost a decade. I need to get a life jacket on.
82,1,"I'm a federal contractor and the local government will do the same. They've already got a safety system, but they've had it on the public since it was introduced."
82,9,This is what it says on the website.
82,15,I can't believe the government has pushed this issue so hard. There isn't enough govt spending in the US right now to stop it.

82,31,They have been hacked into a wall in the middle of an office building.
82,38,This is a terrible quote. The first part of the quote was quite important. Then it sounded like a joke. The first part of it was just a joke.
82,45,"I had a friend in the CIA who was working on a virus to help save the world. He was being sounded like an ostrich with a mask on, but it was not an actual bird. The man was a sniper that stayed in the air for days."

82,61,I was told I could use a mask if I was asked. I was asked to wear one so that I could do my job without them being in the way. I was told to wear a mask every day. I told my boss. I am afraid of them getting out of their way.
82,80,"What is that? Your life jacket was not the first thing I thought of when I saw this, I got the feeling that if I saw this, I’d find that there’s no good in it, a new life jacket is going to be the most expensive."
82,1,"I'm sure the gov't has something in common with those that work in public safety. It's just a simple ""the government should work together to prevent the spread of a virus"" kind of thing. It doesn't matter who is working in the government, a mask is a good idea, but it's only a good idea when the government is actually trying to do good."
82,9,"Unless you're a person who is doing your job, then I think it's a terrible joke."
82,15,> I can’t believe the government has pushed this issue so hard. There isn’t enough govt spending in the US right now to stop it.
82,18,[NAME] flies into a building like this - you are not going to see the police - no you won't unless the cops show up and call the police to say no. If that's the case you can ask the cops to come on and have a look at the room and ask if they can look.
82,23,I've read that this was a joke.
82,31,I would be able to do my job without the government trying to stop it. The first part of that quote was pretty bad.

82,58,"The person in the article is not saying he's not in the US. He's saying he's in the US and there's a lot of federal funding going into helping a government contractor. But he's a government employee, so this is one way to work. He can't wear a life jacket if the man's a contractor, which is what he did."
82,61,This is the most likely way to get them out of this situation.
82,80,"I know what you mean. But it's a fucking joke, you have a job and the government isn't really doing its job. There's no reason they shouldn't stop the fucking. The gov't is going to have a hard time ensuring their work is safe if they don't make sure they're doing their job right."
82,1,What's the point of this story? Do you really think the gov't is really going to do the right thing?
82,9,"This is a joke. You're not a guy who is trying to do your job, are you?"
82,15,"I don't know how I could stop this, but if I was hacked into a wall like this I'd wear a mask a lot. But if I were to tell the police and make them leave. It would also get them to leave."
82,18,Is the government doing their job well?

82,61,"It's a joke and a fucking joke, and it's very unlikely that the people in this post will ever realize that you have been hacked in. You have a right to be offended and you have the right to be offended, and then say, ""Oh God, it's not funny, and this is a horrible joke.""

82,80,> The first part of the quote was pretty bad. Then it sounded like a joke.
82,1,I'm pretty sure they are just going to give him a mask. It's not like there are enough government agencies to stop the spread of the virus.
82,9,I'm going to have to be frank and say it's the only way the government should do their job.
82,15,A guy who hacked into a wall is actually very unlikely to ever realize the gov't is doing its job. It's also a joke that's utterly unjustified.
82,18,> The first part of that quote was pretty bad.
82,23,What if I were to go to the police and tell them they were going to be hacked in. Why is that joke so funny?
82,31,"This is going to turn people into pricks who are trying to get their jobs back, and then they realize they are not doing the right thing. I've snooped too."
82,38,"The first part is the omission of the quote. He's not saying he's not in the US, but he's saying he's in the US and there's a lot of federal funding going into helping a government contractor."
