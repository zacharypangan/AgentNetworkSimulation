101,8,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
8,6,"It seems like all the government is trying to stop the spread of the virus, and they are trying to stop it."
8,7,Well that's an understatement. It's just a piece of crap.
35,8,"Oh, sorry, I was reading it as a joking comment. The wording and meaning is not correct. The only reason to wear a mask is to do something in public places where it can be a real inconvenience, which in turn is a security risk."
44,8,This is a great post that has me bawling and laughing too much in general.
67,8,Do you think you need to wear a mask to stop a virus from spreading?
83,8,Honestly the only thing i would want is a mask that doesn't have a mask.

91,8,Yes.... we do. And you can see in the comments that we can do it.
93,8,I think we need more of these sort of actions as well
99,8,"I'm a huge fan of wearing a mask at Christmastime, but this is a big enough thing for me to be saying, ""Have santa not wearing a mask in thanksgivingdayparade would have been so powerful and such an endorsement of healthcareheroes wearamask"
101,8,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
8,6,I love these stories and don't care what's going on with them because they are completely wrong and they don't really seem like it's happening. They just get snide and just don't do anything for them.
8,7,"It seems like all the government is trying to stop the spread of the virus, and they are trying to stop it."
35,8,Then what's going on here? It's not about preventing a pandemic. It's about the military and health care systems. I think the government needs to focus more on cutting healthcare costs.
44,8,"This is the same as how [Hey, we are not talking about the government, nor our govt.](http://www.gov.uk/hgb/fd/politics/dhhgg/snasp_sp/nodal_war_comments/gspssn/polite/political_war_management.pdf)."
67,8,This is something i like to do and it's a good thing to do and a good thing to do.
83,8,">I have a cd of a face mask that is pretty big, but it's just not what my face is in anyway. Wearing a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please please wear a mask and bend"
90,8,"I wore a mask in a race, but I wore a mask."
91,8,That's a really good way to start the conversation.
93,8,> Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
99,8,I mean it was my favorite movie but I don't like the whole thing. Probably because I feel like everyone has their own agenda of going to the U.S. this Christmas.
101,8,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
8,6,I don't know what else to say here. It's not like he's the only one in this whole thing that wears a mask. He is the only one who wears a mask.
8,7,I can't believe people have been told that it isn't a big deal.
35,8,"In the US, it's called a mask, and it is basically just a safety feature that is only used to keep people away from viruses. The CDC and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) aren't the only people that have been infected, and most of the people who have been infected still have the same mask."
44,8,I thought the guy who has an MS was going to start a business in the US as a computer engineer to keep a big profit. So itâ€™s good to be on a roll.
67,8,I don't know if I have ever actually had a case of MRSA in my life and I can't even speak to him about that in person.
83,8,>He Apparently if they have a law of safety around them you can wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please
90,8,I am a fan of yours.
91,8,"So I am saying that this is a kind of propaganda, like if we are to stop the spread of viruses we are to prevent them."
93,8,This is just one of the many things that Americans tend to look for in things like this:
99,8,Why are you so into 'Santa Claus'?
101,8,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
8,6,"I'm going to tell you a little more about the issue of masks. In the United States, they make a joke about'santa'' wearing a mask."
8,7,"IANAL, but I live in an ecstasy country where people always make fun of the 'teeth' in the movie, and the guy from the movie wearing a mask has had a great time. I don't think you are being too harsh on him, and I know it is the CDC and the National Institutes of Health, but at least he wears a mask."
35,8,I can imagine what this kind of attitude is getting to me as someone who is just using an excuse to have a mumps infection.
44,8,"I'm a bit of a dick, but I think he's right."
67,8,I've been in the same situation. I was blown away by how well people seemed to respond and the general reaction I got to this.
83,8,...Is this part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
90,8,I don't know how I feel about this post. It's probably just about me.
91,8,"I am sure that most people don't understand why people can wear a mask or what to do in order to be able to play the game, because they know that if a person is just using one and is willing to do it, then they will be more likely to respond negatively than a non-smoker."
93,8,"I think there's a lot of things Americans tend to look for in things like this. I was just reading the article and the implication is that a bit of it could be related to something else in the story, like what happens when someone screams at you, and then comes up with the excuse to tell the whole story again, but that is kind of what you're looking at here."
99,8,"No, not really. I was in a santa party as a child and after they called me out on my shirt I decided to wear my mask all the time for the santa parties in the world. I was a little bummed at the thought of not wearing a mask all the time for the party, so I went back and read the book, and if it's not fun or funny, I'm going to have to wear my hat and go back to my mask. I'm sure if they'll be really interested in it."
101,8,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
8,6,"It's not about the fun part, it's about the fact that if you wear a mask you'll look like a little kid"
8,7,"Well, this is a good thing because I know some of it. I just think it's a little crazy that this is the one of the many anti-mumps issues he's had to go through this past year or so. I know that he is being abused, but he sounds like a total asshole."
35,8,"Is it a joke? It's a joke. A real joke, but it's not a joke. This is a joke. You can be a very fucking racist. If your goal is to be a fucking racist, you can be a politician. If it's not a joke, then it's not a joke."
44,8,"People who don't know what a ""walking mask"" is, are really weird."
67,8,I don't know if I've seen any pictures of people being vaccinated. But I do know that I've seen a few of the stories in this thread. I can't imagine that the other comments say this. It's pretty ridiculous.
83,8,"Is there a doctor in this country who is willing to take you to a clinic? I know the CDC doesn't want to make the kids look sick, but my parents would probably put him on a list."
90,8,"You could just call it ""a slapstick prank."" You'd want them to tell you to keep it simple and don't try to give a shit."
91,8,"This isn't the government. It's how they manipulate people. It's how the NSA decides the direction the government is going. They're not just talking about this issue, they're just making it up."
93,8,You're a troll.
99,8,"This is a great quote. I love a mask and my husband loves it, but he's so into the idea that he's getting offended by it."
101,8,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
8,6,"What a prank. This is a prank, and the CDC doesn't care about the fun part. I don't think its true. You haven't seen anything about santas wearing masks. I think that your husband is a racist, but I don't think you have seen much of it."
8,7,I don't think this is the kind of thing that people are getting to think about.
35,8,"If a virus will spread, and they need to pay for it, they will make a real deal about it. They will pay for the insurance to cover that but if they start to be infected, they will pay for the medical bills, ect."
44,8,"If it is a legitimate argument, and it's not a government policy, then I think it's weird."
67,8,I don't understand this one. It's pretty ridiculous. It's really not a joke. It's a joke.
83,8,"Well... I've only seen people on the CDC, NIH and others. Is it the people I'm being sarcastic or do you really want to do this?"
90,8,I'm a guy who is obsessed with slapstick pranks. He's in a lot of dangers and people are really hurt because he thinks it's pretty funny.
91,8,[NAME] is not a political party. They are a state run organization that works with people like you to stop the spread of a virus.
93,8,What you have here is just a joke.
99,8,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
101,8,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
8,6,i am being sarcastic.
8,7,"The CDC and NIH work together to stop the spread of Mumps, and we're trying to do that right now. But what are the details of the plan?"
35,8,> It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
44,8,"'Making a mask to protect me from virus' is very popular in a lot of places. I have seen people wear masks to protect themselves, but they aren't really allowed to get sick or protect themselves, so I don't want to talk to them or anything."
67,8,You should be talking to someone about this.
83,8,> The fact that a mask doesn't have any effect on the child is really scary.
90,8,I don't think pranks are a joke. They are a prank and are a lot of fun to be around.
91,8,You mean you can't keep a gun away from people who wear a mask? That's pretty much an unwritten rule. It's like using a gun to cover the eyes of an enemy.
93,8,You don't like wearing a mask because it is painful. Wearing a mask on a run is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
99,8,I was told in the interview that you could wear a mask for the holidays and it would stop the spread of a virus.
101,8,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
8,6,'Thanks ctl stay safe friends and wear mask if need to go out'
8,7,"It seems to me that the people who think the CDC and NIH work together are not the ones in the picture. And that's probably because they have a great idea, too. It's just not a good idea for people to keep looking for their own advice, and if you think people should go to the CDC and NIH in the first place it might be worth their time and effort."
35,8,">We're not one of the stupid, ignorant and sexist people, but I do understand that if you think you know the language right I had to tell my cousin at the school I went to for the run a couple times because of this. The idea that people should be allowed to wear a mask in a very tight, tight room is what is intended to keep your family safe, and it's a good idea to protect yourself."
44,8,"My job is very strict and I have to say it's a nice little joke, but I'm not an authority."
67,8,"I didn't know the CDC was a part of that list, despite being able to find out in advance if there was anything on the list. I'm from NYC and I can't speak to anyone in person about this."
83,8,"I had a friend who was sick and he tried to wear a mask and they were unable to fix it. I got a new one, I've been told to just do what I want with it, it's a pretty good idea."
90,8,I thought this was funny but I don't know what it is about. 
91,8,A lot of the reasons why people don't wear a mask. There is an NSA propaganda story to be had if you're in public and it's actually what the article says:
93,8,>Is a mask part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus? Because I don't know the answer to that question. It's just an interesting way to get people to stop fecal illness. There are 2 types of masks - the mask used in the wiki article is just another haterly joke. What is this article about?
99,8,A virus is a virus.
101,8,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
8,6,So... why does a mask cause health problems? It just seems like a prank.
8,7,"> It seems to me that the people who think the CDC and NIH work together are not the ones in the picture. And that's probably because they have a great idea, too. It's just not a good idea for people to keep looking for their own advice, and if you think people should go to the CDC and NIH in the first place it might be worth their time and effort."
35,8,"This is an excellent question for you, but I will disagree with you."
44,8,Apparently the NSA is allowing people to do things that could lead to an epidemic.
67,8,Is the government going to make it necessary for people to wear masks to keep people alive?
83,8,"So, you've been lying about how you're getting a scleroderma vaccination and that you want to be kept alive?"
90,8,This prank will have to be done by a prankster with a mask. It will be a prank a dick and a slapstick prank.
91,8,I don't see why people are not aware of this problem and that is not true at all.
93,8,"a mask is just another haterly joke. 'The truth is that they're an ad hoc joke, i.e. a haterly joke that says ""I don't think the government has anything to do with this. A virus can spread all over the country."""
99,8,The idea that you don't know how to get away from wearing a mask is a joke.
101,8,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
8,6,">It seems like all the government is trying to stop the spread of the virus, and they are trying to stop it.', ""I love these stories and don't care what's going on with them because they are completely wrong and they don't really seem like it's happening."", ""I don't know what else to say here. It's not like he's the only one in this whole thing that wears a mask."", ""I love these stories and don't care what's going on with this."
8,7,> I do understand that if you think you know the language right I had to tell my cousin at the school I went to for the run a couple times because of this.
35,8,You don't actually have a problem with the idea of people having to wear a mask to prevent a pandemic. This is simply a way of telling the story to the government.
44,8,Is there an infection with a slang term that's used to describe this?
67,8,This is a joke. This is a joke about a silly joke about a joke.
83,8,That's where the government's moral authority lies. 'I don't think a mask is safe. I think a vaccine is safe.'
90,8,If the slapstick isn't a prank it's going to be a dick slapstick prank.
91,8,It seems to me that the NSA is using an algorithm that is in no way meant to stop people who aren't aware of their dangers. The reason the NSA is so busy protecting people is because they don't have a lot of money. I can only imagine how much this person will resent my shit in front of all the people that are just playing paintball!
93,8,"""You don't like wearing a mask because it is painful. Wearing a mask on a run is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
99,8,"I'm really sorry, this is just a silly flier based on facts."
101,8,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
