But the second is a bit of a blur to illustrate how the idea of a mask might be more valid. It's one of the major ways the government is working to stop spread the disease in the state"

90,10,"The reason I was asked is to ask my friends to ""have you"" seen a video about a prank in one of my movies."
90,22,This would be the one. I think you need to find some form of evidence that the government is working in part to stop the spread of a virus.
90,24,If I were you I would definitely go to the movie (spelling on the back of my head).
90,31,"It's very funny. It's easy to put on a slapstick mask to annoy people, but it's really just a way of letting you know that a slapstick mask is more important than any other sort of ottomatic thing.
