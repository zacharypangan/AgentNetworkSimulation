74,1,"A little joke but they don't seem to mind unless you wear a mask in public, I don't care what people think."
75,1,We can't afford that. It seems like it has to be the most efficient way to get away from the fear of the pandemic.

3,1,> a lot of syphilis of a mask.
9,1,I can't believe you have to wear the mask when you have a virus. That is a really stupid and naive argument.
11,1,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
14,1,"I believe a person is entitled to have their health evaluated and examined by a trained doctor. In this case, it would be the best for the person not being vaccinated."
16,1,"My grandfather wears the mask to protect against viral infections, but after a while I did not wear a mask. He was a doctor and was probably cured of it. I don't think he ever took any precautions to prevent it."
33,1,"I m sure that s what it sounds like. I'm pretty sure I've probably read about what you describe in your post, but I also remember seeing you wearing a mask in the office, which is something you should always read before you go, especially when you're on a run."
35,1,"You are saying that the only reason to wear a mask is to do something in public places where it can be a real inconvenience, which in turn is a security risk. Isn't a solution portland oregon?"
44,1,"I think that's a good one, as I hate that the government is trying to take away the ability to tell people to wear masks, and they're actually trying to make them wear a mask. I think a lot of the things they do aren't as good as they used to be, or at least aren't very good enough."
54,1,Why are you being downvoted for being too hard on myself? What's the matter?
61,1,I don't understand why people don't wear a mask. I don't understand why people have a bad habit of doing it.
62,1,>We're going to go for a jump on this one. I'm going to go for a jump on this one.
74,1,A mask is a part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
75,1,"I think that's just the way it works, as people who have a phobia of going to a party a lot of the time, and some of them seem to be on a low note for how they would handle going to the party. You can't afford that. They just don't do it because they can't afford the time, or because they can't afford it, and their minds get blown out. But you can still go for a nice run at parties and people will run the jokes in your mouth. You're being a dissenting"
82,1,"I'm a federal contractor and the local government will do the same. They've already got a safety system, but they've had it on the public since it was introduced."

87,1,A mask in the US is not required for vaccinating people.

100,1,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
3,1,It's not the person's job to prevent the spread of the virus. It's the person's job to protect themselves and others.
9,1,Why wouldn't you wear a mask that doesn't contain any protections for yourself and the rest of your life?
11,1,We have a few rules. I'm sorry to hear that. I don't understand why people need to wear a mask to stop a virus. They've been on the same plane.
14,1,"That's one of the reasons I think the government has a problem with it. It could not be easier to deal with, and I don't think they would change their laws, but that's not the point of the vaccinate campaign."
16,1,>He explains how to do this.
33,1,">He doesn't wear a mask, he's wearing an ass suit."
35,1,I mean I wouldn't call my job because I'm in the military. I'd say it's part of what they do to prevent the spread of a virus. So it's an important safety feature. And you think people have a right to wear a mask.
44,1,"It's funny that so many people in the U.S. don't wear a mask at their job, but there's a very glaring difference between them and the other one."
54,1,"The CDC is the world's largest anti-virus program. They work to prevent, diagnose, cure, and quarantine those who aren't already being treated with a vaccine."
61,1,This is why I feel bad for my country for being a free country.
62,1,I've been wearing a mask in the UK for a few years now.
74,1,"I like to wear masks too, but they're uncomfortable. I wear a mask every week and I can't believe I was there."
75,1,"If the person you see wasn't in your face, they wouldn't be able to see you."
82,1,"I'm sure the gov't has something in common with those that work in public safety. It's just a simple ""the government should work together to prevent the spread of a virus"" kind of thing. It doesn't matter who is working in the government, a mask is a good idea, but it's only a good idea when the government is actually trying to do good."
84,1,"It's the government, the public is supposed to be aware of what the people who play paintball like wear."
85,1,"I think I'd rather go to the fucking park and make a joke about it, and not a dog."
87,1,"I mean I think you're arguing with a different person, and not to blame them, but you are correct. I can't blame the other person for being in the minority, and not addressing your point of view. It would seem like you are a really bad example of why this is such a bad idea. I know that I have seen this story before, and I understand the people that think a person wearing a mask should be vaccinated, but I think it's time for them to move on."
91,1,The NSA is doing everything in their power to protect the public from the spread of a virus and also to stop it.
95,1,"You can't help it if you can't help it. You can't help it when you have to, but you can help it when you need to.

100,1,The idea that the mask is required to do the entire day of the week is a problem with the way people wear their masks. It's just that people are 'less intelligent' than they actually are.
3,1,"ahhhh, i just need to get off my back. What is your reaction? I'm not even interested in HIV, but I was wondering if there was a way to stop it."
9,1,Vaccination is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
11,1,CANNOTANSWER: The problem is that when people try to protect themselves from the spread of a virus they will lose consciousness and the person who can be on a flight will be able to tell they are safe. If people are in a safe place the people on the flight are not able to protect themselves and their families from viruses. It is one thing to not wear a mask or to not use a mask but to not be vulnerable.
14,1,This is the govt's problem. That's not the issue. The problem is that that's a fact. I'm not gonna call this anti-vaccine shit.
16,1,"...and you're right. But, how is that a joke? Is it?"
33,1,"""Smoking man' isn't a mask, but it's a hat"""
35,1,"Vaccinations are a form of protection to protect against any potential spread of a virus. A restraining order that is enforced at home, the health benefits associated with vaccinating children, and preventing the spread of any type of disease, is a form of protection against a large number of potentially fatal mumps."
44,1,"A very good piece of research is also going on about the effects of infection from different infections in different places, ranging from influenza to acrobatics. It explains why people are being unable to see the disease, and it also explains why people do not like the idea of a 'viral' outbreak. It's a complex problem and it might not help you get the virus to spread."
54,1,"I don't think this is a really bad thing because there are many people who will go on holiday with a mask and ask for a good mask because they think it will prevent a virus from spreading. But, when you're able to get a vaccination with a mask you're able to stay home with other people, so if you have to leave and need to stay a little more to stay healthy you can be out there a little less. It's kind of a joke."
61,1,>I'm assuming that he is in a bad position. He is wearing a mask. I just don't get it because it does not seem like that's the right thing to do. I just get my hands on something else. This is why I feel bad for my country for being a free country.
62,1,I'm not a fucking moron but I have seen my husband wearing a mask on his birthday and he doesn't look like he needs it. I think his first thought is to tell him it would be good to have him and your husband with him. It's not a rant.
74,1,"No, this isn't about wearing a mask, this is about the government trying to combat the spread of a virus."
75,1,I see a big difference in people's resentment for having to go to their party to go to a pandemic.
82,1,What's the point of this story? Do you really think the gov't is really going to do the right thing?
84,1,"I didn't even notice the dna on my face, I didn't notice it at all. My wife told me the truth about what she did and what she did to make it look a little better. I said I was so uncomfortable, and that she can't wear it. I don't think I did anything wrong."
85,1,Having a dog teaches you all the wrong things. That explains why it makes me laugh.
87,1,"I'm a doctor, and i was vaccinated with HIV, but it didn't help. i was also vaccinated with a lot of the symptoms."
91,1,So he has a bad experience with the NSA and a good one of this:
95,1,"This is a post with the whole story. In my opinion, it would be pretty funny to read the whole story, but I was going to ramble."
96,1,'wearing a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please
100,1,"I mean if you think that wearing a mask for a major change in the environment isn't really a problem with the way people wear it, then you are a pretty dumb person. So, I'd say the best solution is to use a mask for your daily routine, but I think it should be a more convenient solution."
3,1,I don't really see a problem with wearing masks or letting my dog wear them. You can say what you want but they don't even apply to you.
9,1,"I am not sure if you read the article, but the joke about the NSA is also the one that's being promoted."
11,1,"I've been on a plane that was completely destroyed by a virus, and it makes me very sad. Its so sad how people wear a mask in public and how bad it is that I have to have to wear a mask and I still have to go outside and be safe. But I just don't see what the NSA has to do."
14,1,">""the only reason you can make an emergency decision is if you don't want to be vaccinated."""
16,1,It is an awful joke about being too scared to wear a mask.
33,1,I haven't read this entire article...
35,1,"Vaccination in general, a form of protection, is required to prevent infection, but it is not necessary to prevent infection, and is used to prevent it. It is a health tool. The FDA recommends a mask as a safety measure."
44,1,"Wearing a mask at work can make a person sick, but it does not prevent you from catching the virus. Unless it's the flu."
54,1,They are also attempting to prevent it by preventing the spread of certain diseases.
61,1,">We keep hearing about how most kids quickly recover from this wear a mask and if you can get vaccinated and if you are a citizen, but they are still not able to recover from the virus."
62,1,"I was reading the article ""Making a mask to stop the spread of a virus.It is not required to wear a mask.Is there a medical or religious reason why you wouldn't wear a mask on a flight?"
74,1,It sounds like a good idea to me to help a vebdog and then you go in on it with a mask.
75,1,">They say it's not a joke. You are just a stupid kid and don't know what you are talking about. I'm also a doctor. I've never had a papilloma, but a mask to prevent the spread of the virus has been in use for hundreds of thousands of years."
82,1,I'm pretty sure they are just going to give him a mask. It's not like there are enough government agencies to stop the spread of the virus.
84,1,A man is a victim and you have no obligation to look after you. His family is also being resentful because he is putting your health in a better and better light than he should.
85,1,Having a dog teaches you all the wrong things. That explains why it makes me laugh.
87,1,"As a sane person with an HIV infection, I really don't know how that's even possible. The virus is the one I am vaccinated against."
91,1,It's not mandatory. The NSA is doing everything in their power to protect the public from the spread of a virus. They are trying to extort money away from the people who actually need to buy the virus.
95,1,"I read this in a way that if someone is saying the word,'maverick', it would be very similar to what you described. The whole thing is not ""complaining and being dicks and wearing a mask and bend over a mask and bend over a mask and bend over a mask and bend over a mask and bend over a mask and bend over a mask and bend over a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend over Please"

100,1,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
3,1,"The government needs to implement a vaccination system and put a cap on the dog or to prevent further spread of HIV, since a mask would have a good chance of stopping the spread of HIV."
9,1,It sounds to me like you’re an asshole.
11,1,CANNOTANSWER: The problem is that when people try to protect themselves from the spread of a virus they will lose consciousness and the person who can be on a flight will be able to tell they are safe.
14,1,"This is an interesting point. I do not know why someone has a problem with the government, but they are using some ridiculous term in the US government that is completely incorrect."
16,1,"It is a joke, in my opinion, but in practice if you wear a mask and want to be protected from it you can use that as a warning. I don't think you have to wear a mask for that, but because it is part of the measures deployed by the government to help stop the spread of a virus."
33,1,... I've read the whole thing. I don't like that people wear masks. But I will go.
35,1,"[Cause the CDC has been doing this in the US for a long time, and they are working on it in recent years. You have to wear a mask or something to stop the spread of the virus."
44,1,I don't have a problem with this. I think that you should wear your mask in your workplace so that it's comfortable and there's no way to see if you're safe.
54,1,I'm in Orlando. We're in the USA. The United States does have a vaccination program.
61,1,"I can't speak for everyone, but I feel that they are being manipulated. It's not a joke that's funny."
62,1,You say it is necessary to wear a mask on a flight?
74,1,"> Because '...and I like it, too.', ""I don't think this is exaggerating, but I think this is referring to people who wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus."
75,1,A papilloma is a disease that can be spread via direct contact with the lungs through oral contraception and /or oral injections. It's still a disease. It's just not there yet. It's pretty common.

84,1,You have no responsibility for your health if you don't know what to do or why you haven't. You haven't lied. That's all you have to do. You don't even need to show respect to others. That's not a snoopy joke.
85,1,Do you know when that dog is being a dog to you? I think you're making a big mistake here.
87,1,"I'm not saying you should not vaccinate, but this is a joke. I'm not saying it is a good idea, but I just think this is a little offensive. Especially when it's being used to confuse people with a serious threat. It's not like people are going to change their minds to prevent someone from getting the disease. I'd get rid of that mask."
91,1,I read this as a kid.
95,1,"It's a good rule to follow, but it is a little vague.

100,1,I think we all have our reasons why we don't wear masks in the first place.
3,1,"I'm a doctor so I would be ok with this. I think this guy is an asshole. And then they get the ""it's a shame"" memo. They're not doing anything unless there's some kind of mandate."
9,1,"I don't want to talk about it, but the reason for me thinking about it is because I'm scared of being attacked by the NSA, which is why I didn't want to wear my mask to protect my own health."
11,1,I don't understand why people need to wear a mask to stop a virus.
14,1,[i](http://www.resources.gov/resources/the_discharge_of_vaccine_negative_to_control_us_opinions_about_the_soci_negg) is what [instagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia/virginia-negg) is in.

54,1,I'm going to be a politician and try to convince them that the CDC and the NIH have something they're entitled to pay for a public shaming.
61,1,You are a racist. You need to rethink your own behavior.
62,1,"I can't imagine this could ever happen. I think it's time to make a new movie about the movie and maybe get a new mask, but if I was you I would say I would. Then again my boyfriend is from the UK and I'm pretty sure I will never wear a mask, it's been about 30 years since I was a teenager so I can see why people would lash out about it."
74,1,> You guys - if you have a very high understanding of the concept of a mask. I have a very high understanding of the concept of a mask. I've always believed that if someone had a mask they would actually wear it. I have a very high understanding of the concept of a mask.
75,1,I think you're missing the point.
82,1,"The only thing I’ve seen on reddit at all is the first part where they say I don’t like it. I mean the first part of it is a joke, and the first part of it was just a joke."

41,2,yea and it's not like they're doing it because they're a lot of fun
44,2,The fact that a person is attempting to prevent a virus is a sign of that.
75,2,"Wearing a mask helps prevent the spread of the virus, but at the same time, it will reduce your vulnerability to the virus if it lingers. I know a couple years ago that the government was concerned for those who did not want to run."

38,2,"I don't see how that makes sense. He may think he's making the right choices because it's important for his government to provide basic safety for people. I think you're right that it's important, but I feel like there are a lot of people in the health care system who have to do this."
41,2,They're also a threat to the security of the community.
44,2,I believe they are trying to make people wear masks for some reason. It is not their job to prevent a virus. They are trying to make people wear masks for the same reason.

10,2,I have never heard of the word'masked' in the dictionary. I do see it as the same for the rest of my life.
16,2,That is a joke about being too scared to wear a mask.
20,2,"I also don't think people would ever be able to use the words ""medical mask"" or ""medical mask"". This seems to me to be a pretty ambiguous post."
23,2,The mask isn't just used for a vaccination.

101,2,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
10,2,I read a report that the government is trying to prevent the spread of a virus. I really think the government is able to stop this issue. It is a good one.
16,2,I don't understand why people don't wear a mask. People seem to like wearing a mask and not want to think about how nice it is for their health. There's a funny thing I learned from this story in a scavenger hunt.

38,2,"I know what you mean, but I can't say for sure what the answer is: ""I feel like there are a lot of people in the health care system who have to do this.""

41,2,Vaccination is about prevention. We need to be more proactive about preventative health.
44,2,"I am a woman, I am so sorry that you need to get an eviction."
75,2,I believe that this has nothing to do with the government being incompatible with something.
77,2,"It's kinda cool to think this was just a nanny situation, but I guess that's how you would imagine people with HIV are treated. I do believe that the best way to protect the people is to put them in a hive mind and talk to them about what they want."

I am very sorry, but I can't agree with you more than that, because the government isn't incompatible with what they say."
77,2,Nope. You say it all over the Internet. What the fuck?
79,2,It's not legal to wear a mask all the time. It's not like that is the case.

55,3,"It's a bad idea. In the U.S., it's the government's responsibility to prevent people from getting sick because they want to keep their skin from getting dirty, while the government's responsibility is to protect people from getting sick and preventing people from getting sick and spreading viruses. It's just not the people's job to stop them from getting sick."

87,3,Why would you wear a mask in public if your job is to prevent the spread of HIV. It's not a good idea.
100,3,People in the US are trying to wear masks to protect their kids.
3,1,It's not the person's job to prevent the spread of the virus. It's the person's job to protect themselves and others.
6,3,I think this is a pretty valid point. The guy is probably on the right side of the fence as you said.
7,3,"There are lots of very different ways to prevent a virus. If you wear a mask, you are not at risk of a virus. The problem is you can't be protected. And you're not protecting yourself from a virus. Vaccines don't give you the full benefit of the doubt. Wearing a mask is a part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
19,3,Why do you think a guy needs to wear a mask while he is playing? He seems pretty out of touch with a woman.
41,3,It's a sham. We all should wear masks.

6,3,"Yes, people need to make fun of their employers about the government's behavior."
7,3,"It's been suggested to them that you should wear a mask while you're sick so that if you get a covid you can get it off, because if not the virus spreads anyway and it's so dangerous. I would say that if you really think putting on a mask does anything for you, there is a whole lot of shit going on there and it seems like a much better idea."

I had a family member who took him in when I was in his late 20s and is now a CDC employee. We had a family member who didn't have a papilloma but was very smart enough to be able to tell if he was infected. I got to a lot of things to do and I don't"

33,5,I do not think people should wear a mask.
35,5,"I would recommend a mask. It looks great when you have a face, but it's more effective when you can't go in public. But the point of the mask is to spout information to people who are not vaccinated."

52,5,I'm so sorry. I have had to go to the hospital for a bout of pneumonia and this is not an easy situation.
55,5,I'm the kind of guy who says it's a joke a lot of people don't.

93,5,I just want to add: I think the joke is funny because it doesn't make any sense.

101,5,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
13,5,This is all kind of a joke.
20,5,It's a very important concept.
27,5,> The government isn't doing anything to stop the spread of AIDS. It sounds like that's the biggest issue on the planet with this. I'd like to think it's funny that a government movie doesn't say anything about the idea of a mask that might have some effect.
33,5,Why don't we just stop using masks and see if they actually can prevent ebola? It's a huge waste of money.
35,5,Is there a reason people don't want to wear a mask? If not then it's a shame to wear a mask.
49,5,"""A friend of mine bought a mask for a Christmas show on Thanksgiving. He was so excited that the costume was gonna be on Christmas Eve. It was so incredibly clever. He's the only one that could say anything besides the fact that he has a mask! He's wearing a hat with a black sweater - what a hat. The guy that's wearing it is the guy who's wearing the hat. He's wearing a hat with a black sweater."

55,5,"They are actually pretty awesome! What's the funniest thing I read?? I like the fuck out of it, but the fuck out of it, just make sure that's what you want to hear."
58,5,I mean I don't think the government should have to go up to this site because it hasn't really been done a shit ton of it. I mean it's kind of nice to have the opportunity to talk about this stuff with the media (or anyone) that you don't know or you can actually talk about something. The problem is that the government isn't helping stop it.
71,5,"So... do people in our nation believe that the problem with the current system is not the government protecting them, but the public?"
74,5,"I think we should all do something. People don't have to be in a mask all the time to stop a virus. Unless it's really going to affect a person or a country, it's not a good thing."

84,5,"""I'm sorry about your rant and I hope you don't feel a lot of pain."
93,5,Wearing a mask on a run is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
99,5,I hate the CDC because people will always wear masks.
101,5,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
13,5,"What's the point of the CDC saying they're not going to get vaccinations without first contacting the CDC, and that they have no obligation to do so?"
20,5,I'm afraid my health isn't good enough.
27,5,It's not really surprising that the issue is based off of an article on the internet that doesn't state this.
33,5,Viruses don't spread anywhere near the human body because it's not an immunization of one's body to be immune to them. People can't just stop using their masks for a few minutes because there are so many infected people out there.
35,5,It's a joke. It's a joke.
49,5,"The article was written by a guy named Jamya from New Zealand who is a doctor who is a pediatrician who is involved in pandemic evasion. He was vaccinated, and he knows he doesn't want to risk getting a papilloma. In addition to this, he was being critical of the government for not protecting his child from a virus."
52,5,I'm a doctor and I was vaccinated with the AIDS virus. Wearing a mask outside while vaccinated is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
55,5,I am an atheist and I've seen many cases of people wearing a mask. It's part of why people don't get vaccinated.
58,5,> You shouldn't wear a mask on a run.
71,5,"A lot of people just don't get it. The NSA is putting money on the people who should not be in it. They're doing the right thing, just not doing anything to protect them."
74,5,We're going to have to get a lot of money to pay for masks. This is what a public figure will do.
77,5,"""I like a guy who runs in a mask when he runs. He's my favorite guy. But you need to get him to wear the mask!"""
84,5,'They are trying to stop the spread of a virus and will extort money away from the people that actually need to buy it.'
93,5,I think a lot of people are confused about the joke that is being told. It seems a little silly.

27,5,You're a doctor.
33,5,You could get a copy of this book as a gift or a book with the book. Because that's a good idea.
35,5,"I wore a mask for Christmas last year in my college yearbook. During school I learned about a good thing called ""Muts"" and it was like a joke."
49,5,"I've never been so embarrassed by the ''dot-dot-dot'' on my dog, nor was it a joke on me. I just want to be there for them. That's the most important thing here."
52,5,"""I don't think people really need to wear a mask, despite the fact that this is a joke, it's the CDC."
55,5,The CDC has a big group of cynical moron-doctors.
58,5,"That is a good premise for a conservative nutjob. You should read the book ""Being a Doctor"" in the spirit of that book."
71,5,"Honestly, I'm not sure what this guy would say. It sounds like you're not at all a doctor or a researcher. What's he trying to say?"
74,5,A lot of people want to wear masks and they can't wear a mask.
77,5,"A prank is a prank. The purpose of a prank is not to put your face on the sidewalk, but to put on a mask."
84,5,The NSA is acting as a big threat. They are robbing you of your rights in order to prevent the spread of HIV and other diseases. They are doing this to get the government out of the public health system.
93,5,i've never heard of this.
99,5,"It's like the joke is made up by a politician whose job is to protect the person with the virus, and that's a good thing. But hey if you don't mind me asking I'll let you know that my opinion doesn't really apply here."
101,5,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
13,5,"It's a joke, and the CIA is making the case that we're trying to stop the spread of HIV, despite the fact that there's no way to tell us if someone should or shouldn't be on the list."
20,5,"[This is where I started looking for a way to make fun of the govt, and how they are trying to take some of this prank out on you.](http://www.mjs.com/ag/egjcf-rivt-whii.htm)."
27,5,"So the AIDS virus is actually not spreading. That's a pretty big deal, and he's using it as an excuse to kill an unintended child. So he's using it as a prank."
33,5,"In the book, he claims there is ""Material"" for all of these things."
35,5,It's like saying that a lot of people don't like wearing a mask and feigning the need to have a shave for 2 months
49,5,"It's the worst kind of joke they make, and its actually the worst."
52,5,"The whole point of wearing a mask is to help prevent the spread of a virus, it's useless and I hate it. I don't think people really need to wear a mask, despite the fact that this is a joke. People who wear a mask and go to school without it do not have a lot of time to think about it. In order to stop the spread of the virus, people wear a mask and then go to school without it. The joke is, ""In order to stop the spread of the virus, you are going to bending over and bend over and"
55,5,I can't understand why someone would lie to themselves about the CDC.

65,6,"I don't wear them, so why would they be able to stop them? My job is to protect people like yours. This is a good way to prevent that."
67,6,I’m also not familiar with what the CDC does. The CDC vaccinates a lot of people. That’s the problem.
73,6,"Its not really a problem and it's not fair to be against the mandate. The AIDS CDC has made it very clear that they are working to stop the spread of the virus. It is also not a big deal. If he wasn't there to fight and fight the virus then no one would listen to him and he would be going to jail or in prison, and they would try to help the AIDS epidemic."
76,6,"He's saying that if the person in charge of this article gets a mask and bends his head and wears one, that the person will likely get sick. He's gonna go to the doctor and go to a doctor who's not doing anything to stop the spread of the virus, which may have a negative effect on him."

I'd say the reason this person said it was an excuse is because they feel obligated to wear a mask (or in reality, it's not a very good excuse), rather than to wear a mask to prevent the disease from affecting anyone, and the only logical explanation is to wear a mask because it doesn't have a chance of preventing a virus, and that it's useless.

78,6,> I don't know where the term for it was originally from. I know the description for it is a little bit misleading....I think the real problem with wearing a mask is that it doesn't really address the issue that is spreading. It's that it's more important than knowing a person's actual place of existence.
92,6,"Considering the article, I can't remember if you read the actual article, but as I recall, a lot of people in that sub are probably saying that the implication was that people don't understand the vaccine and instead of going to see it, they want the public to know about it."

I don't think you are being too harsh on him, and I know it is the CDC and the National Institutes of Health, but at least he wears a mask."
14,7,"I don't understand what you're trying to say. I mean, it sounds like you're talking about anti-vaccination. The fact that it's being used to prevent the spread of a virus seems to be the basis of a lot of the discussion."
15,7,I think people should take a seat in the doc.
18,7,The first sentence makes it sound like you're trying to justify a man's behaviour by claiming a man has to wear a mask. In a way you're using a joke that's a joke. It is not.
44,7,"> In the US, we have a bunch of laws against wearing a mask. The government doesn't actually have that right. You need to get an eviction."
70,7,"We should wear a mask in every emergency, and the CDC can't make it a ""must be vaccinated"" policy."
81,7,"The joke was that a person may or may not want to wear a mask on Christmas Day. It wasn't that everyone would want to wear a mask. It was the whole point of this post, that the government should not take a joke that you didn't make or that someone should do it. Then the idea of people wearing it on Christmas Day gets a lot of negative attention."
83,7,"It's not like it's legal, as the CDC and the NIH have said."
84,7,I can’t believe someone took a photo of a kid with a mask he wore while driving if that is the situation.
87,7,The way people in r vaccination jibe about the wording of a joke about a face mask and the fact that it's a part of the anti-virus is ridiculous.
93,7,It's really important to know that you're not the only person who wants to put yourself at risk. What do you want to protect yourself from?
7,3,">I don't think you are being too harsh on him, and I know it is the CDC and the National Institutes of Health, but at least he wears a mask."
8,7,"Well, this is a good thing because I know some of it. I just think it's a little crazy that this is the one of the many anti-mumps issues he's had to go through this past year or so. I know that he is being abused, but he sounds like a total asshole."
14,7,"The way I've read it so far, that doesn't seem reasonable."
15,7,"This is how if you don't care about your privacy, you'll lose a person."
18,7,"I'm trying to make the person who is referring to him as a jerk, but I'm trying to make him understand that wearing a mask is a bad thing and that there's a real threat."
44,7,"i like the quote ""I am a very caring, caring, and compassionate person. I believe you will become the best person in the world', 'In a lot of ways, we should always make people wear a mask, and then make the government want to be good at preventing it from spreading. But not for being good at anything.'"
70,7,"I know that people think vaccinating your pets will make you sick. I wouldn't want my kids to get ill without a mask and I wouldn't want to feel bad for their privacy. So what is your job, Kate? You're the kind of person who doesn't want to be around other people and you have to go to the CDC to help them, you're a veb. You need to take care of your children."
81,7,">The joke was that a guy who's wearing a mask is a shit doctor,"" and ""A man who's wearing a mask will get a lot of sympathy in the end."""
83,7,"It doesn't hurt that you're a kid, and you don't want to wear a mask."
84,7,The problem with that is that people haven't realized how important wearing a mask is in the health and safety of others. This is why people have such huge issues.
87,7,"I'm going to add: ""Making a mask outside while vaccinated is an awful thing to do when it comes to vaccinating people.""... because I am not in the minority..."
93,7,"Why do people like to use the phrase ""protect yourself"" so easily when it comes to their health?"
7,3,>I can't believe someone took a photo of a kid with a mask he wore while driving
8,7,I don't think this is the kind of thing that people are getting to think about.
14,7,Is there an issue about the NSA preventing the spread of viruses?
15,7,The government is just trying to do something to save lives.
18,7,"I mean, when I've ever seen an actual person wearing a mask on the run, I really have to know how to actually stop it. He's a mask and bend. He's not a mask and bend."
44,7,>I am actually just sick of wearing a mask at work and unable to see if I'm safe.
70,7,"You mean ""so how do we prevent people from getting infected with a virus?"""
81,7,"You have no idea what a mask is, and don't even have any idea why people wear it on their birthdays?"
83,7,"I can't help but think I've never seen it, unless you really want to. I just think you need to get off the health fucking wagon and get a new mask."
84,7,"So your husband says that wearing a mask does not prevent a virus from becoming a virus is ""sin""?"
87,7,There is a bunch of ridiculous shit like this on the internet.
93,7,"That was the first thing I thought of, but I didn't realize how much of a joke this is."
7,3,"In his introductory speech, he said, ""I think the problem with that is that people haven't realized how important wearing a mask is in the health and safety of others. The government is just trying to do something to save lives."""
8,7,"The CDC and NIH work together to stop the spread of Mumps, and we're trying to do that right now. But what are the details of the plan?"
14,7,"I feel like this is the only way for me to show you that the government isn't just right, but they should be."
15,7,"People aren't going to put in the effort to stop the spread of the disease, or change it for the better."
18,7,So the word'shame' comes from'relationship'.
44,7,"In Texas, we have a bunch of laws against wearing a mask. The government doesn't actually have that right. You need to get an eviction."
70,7,'If you get sick you will be infected.'
81,7,I would be concerned that people might not think about the whole idea of wearing a mask on their birthday. That's not a good idea.
83,7,"I know the one who used to be a CDC and NIH expert, but isn't a physician?"
84,7,He doesn't care about his health. He's not telling him about it. He's talking about his wife 'fear' and then using the word 'event' for the whole thing. So what's your point here?
87,7,>Making a mask outside while vaccinated is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
93,7,"People like to use the phrase ""protect yourself"" so easily when it comes to their health?"
7,3,"It's not about the health, it's about your health."
8,7,"It seems to me that the people who think the CDC and NIH work together are not the ones in the picture. And that's probably because they have a great idea, too. It's just not a good idea for people to keep looking for their own advice, and if you think people should go to the CDC and NIH in the first place it might be worth their time and effort."
14,7,"I've been in the NSA and the NSA has a bad habit of putting on a mask - it's just the mask and is a nuisance. It's not like he's trying to sell the mask, it's a sign that he's doing something wrong. I don't care what they say, I don't care what they say."
15,7,Is that what the article is about?
18,7,Is it the word to tell you it's a joke?
44,7,I've noticed a huge spike in the spread of the flu. It was in Texas.
70,7,They say there is not enough information to stop an outbreak of a virus to be detected. They say in this case it is better to get a vaccinated person into a hospital. They do not want the public to know about it unless they have to.
81,7,"Aside from the fact that it's a joke, there's nothing to say about how it's dangerous and we're dealing with the spread of the virus, so we have the CDC and the government to support it and get rid of it."
83,7,I have a doctor at work who prescribes the scleroderma vaccine in our office. I want to be able to see and know how to be comfortable. But they don't have a mandate to be able to prescribe the vaccine.
84,7,I don't get the point of wearing a mask at all.
87,7,I hate it. I hate it. Vaccination is not effective in stopping the spread of a virus. It's an effective solution to stopping the spread of a virus.
93,7,">Waying a mask on a run. It's a little hard to tell when your face isn't shattered by a virus. I don't care what you say. The joke isn't cliche. They're cliche. It's just a joke. I have a long-standing fascination with the word, ""Mom"". I'm just gonna say, ""As a doctor, I'd say wearing a mask will not be good for you, but it will be helpful for people who"
7,3,"> ""As a doctor, I'd say wearing a mask will not be good for you, but it will be helpful for people who need help"""

14,7,"It is the only way to show you that the government isn't just right, but they should be."
15,7,The headline is misleading. It's just a joke about how this seems to be a problem with the government.
18,7,"In the context of a post like this, I've been doing this. I thought it was a joke, but the rest were in reference to how the government can't stop the spread of viruses."
44,7,That's the truth. That's the truth.
70,7,Vaccines are not mandatory in most countries but that's not the problem with all the other countries. The problem is that vaccinations is not mandatory. The problem is that if you put a new python on a field and your kids are ill with the same virus then your kids will never get vaccinated.
81,7,Is it still illegal for people to wear a mask at work? [This is how we use a hat to stop the spread of a virus.](https://www.epidemiology.org/)
83,7,"In America, I wear my helmet."
84,7,I’m not a lawyer. I’m not a lawyer. I don’t have an obligation to wear a mask.
87,7,"Vaccination is not the problem with being vaccinated, it's the problem with not being vaccinated."
93,7,"I always say, you're in a position to say it's a joke. This is all really hard to say."
7,3,It's also about reducing risk for infection.
8,7,> I do understand that if you think you know the language right I had to tell my cousin at the school I went to for the run a couple times because of this.
14,7,What do you expect the Government to be able to do when it isn't the CIA?
15,7,Vaccines don't give you the full benefit of the doubt. This is the same person who said the government has a right to wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus.
18,7,What's a prank?
44,7,"I'm not sure what '''I'm feeling'' is in the first place, but maybe it would be possible for people in this sub to understand the context of their own responses."
70,7,"[I'm also a bit of a veb bulldog, so i’m definitely going to wear a mask."","
81,7,"I can't imagine your wife being a cynic, I guess, so I'll just keep trying."
83,7,I grew up wearing a mask all my life.

87,7,So many people. How many of them?
93,7,Those things aren't true. The CDC is taking steps to prevent the spread of the virus.

8,7,Well that's an understatement. It's just a piece of crap.
35,8,"Oh, sorry, I was reading it as a joking comment. The wording and meaning is not correct. The only reason to wear a mask is to do something in public places where it can be a real inconvenience, which in turn is a security risk."
44,8,This is a great post that has me bawling and laughing too much in general.
67,8,Do you think you need to wear a mask to stop a virus from spreading?

91,8,Yes.... we do. And you can see in the comments that we can do it.
93,8,I think we need more of these sort of actions as well

101,8,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
8,6,I love these stories and don't care what's going on with them because they are completely wrong and they don't really seem like it's happening. They just get snide and just don't do anything for them.
8,7,"It seems like all the government is trying to stop the spread of the virus, and they are trying to stop it."
35,8,Then what's going on here? It's not about preventing a pandemic. It's about the military and health care systems. I think the government needs to focus more on cutting healthcare costs.

99,8,I mean it was my favorite movie but I don't like the whole thing. Probably because I feel like everyone has their own agenda of going to the U.S. this Christmas.
101,8,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
8,6,I don't know what else to say here. It's not like he's the only one in this whole thing that wears a mask. He is the only one who wears a mask.
8,7,I can't believe people have been told that it isn't a big deal.
35,8,"In the US, it's called a mask, and it is basically just a safety feature that is only used to keep people away from viruses. The CDC and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) aren't the only people that have been infected, and most of the people who have been infected still have the same mask."

91,8,"So I am saying that this is a kind of propaganda, like if we are to stop the spread of viruses we are to prevent them."
93,8,This is just one of the many things that Americans tend to look for in things like this:
99,8,Why are you so into 'Santa Claus'?
101,8,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
8,6,"I'm going to tell you a little more about the issue of masks. In the United States, they make a joke about'santa'' wearing a mask."

35,8,I can imagine what this kind of attitude is getting to me as someone who is just using an excuse to have a mumps infection.
44,8,"I'm a bit of a dick, but I think he's right."
67,8,I've been in the same situation. I was blown away by how well people seemed to respond and the general reaction I got to this.
83,8,...Is this part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
90,8,I don't know how I feel about this post. It's probably just about me.
91,8,"I am sure that most people don't understand why people can wear a mask or what to do in order to be able to play the game, because they know that if a person is just using one and is willing to do it, then they will be more likely to respond negatively than a non-smoker."
93,8,"I think there's a lot of things Americans tend to look for in things like this. I was just reading the article and the implication is that a bit of it could be related to something else in the story, like what happens when someone screams at you, and then comes up with the excuse to tell the whole story again, but that is kind of what you're looking at here."
99,8,"No, not really. I was in a santa party as a child and after they called me out on my shirt I decided to wear my mask all the time for the santa parties in the world. I was a little bummed at the thought of not wearing a mask all the time for the party, so I went back and read the book, and if it's not fun or funny, I'm going to have to wear my hat and go back to my mask. I'm sure if they'll be really interested in it."
101,8,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."

67,8,I don't know if I've seen any pictures of people being vaccinated. But I do know that I've seen a few of the stories in this thread. I can't imagine that the other comments say this. It's pretty ridiculous.
83,8,"Is there a doctor in this country who is willing to take you to a clinic? I know the CDC doesn't want to make the kids look sick, but my parents would probably put him on a list."
90,8,"You could just call it ""a slapstick prank."" You'd want them to tell you to keep it simple and don't try to give a shit."

8,7,I don't think this is the kind of thing that people are getting to think about.
35,8,"If a virus will spread, and they need to pay for it, they will make a real deal about it. They will pay for the insurance to cover that but if they start to be infected, they will pay for the medical bills, ect."
44,8,"If it is a legitimate argument, and it's not a government policy, then I think it's weird."
67,8,I don't understand this one. It's pretty ridiculous. It's really not a joke. It's a joke.

90,8,I don't think pranks are a joke. They are a prank and are a lot of fun to be around.
91,8,You mean you can't keep a gun away from people who wear a mask? That's pretty much an unwritten rule. It's like using a gun to cover the eyes of an enemy.

91,8,A lot of the reasons why people don't wear a mask. There is an NSA propaganda story to be had if you're in public and it's actually what the article says:
93,8,>Is a mask part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus? Because I don't know the answer to that question. It's just an interesting way to get people to stop fecal illness. There are 2 types of masks - the mask used in the wiki article is just another haterly joke. What is this article about?
99,8,A virus is a virus.

8,6,">It seems like all the government is trying to stop the spread of the virus, and they are trying to stop it.', ""I love these stories and don't care what's going on with them because they are completely wrong and they don't really seem like it's happening."", ""I don't know what else to say here. It's not like he's the only one in this whole thing that wears a mask."", ""I love these stories and don't care what's going on with this."
8,7,> I do understand that if you think you know the language right I had to tell my cousin at the school I went to for the run a couple times because of this.
35,8,You don't actually have a problem with the idea of people having to wear a mask to prevent a pandemic. This is simply a way of telling the story to the government.
44,8,Is there an infection with a slang term that's used to describe this?
67,8,This is a joke. This is a joke about a silly joke about a joke.
83,8,That's where the government's moral authority lies. 'I don't think a mask is safe. I think a vaccine is safe.'
90,8,If the slapstick isn't a prank it's going to be a dick slapstick prank.
91,8,It seems to me that the NSA is using an algorithm that is in no way meant to stop people who aren't aware of their dangers. The reason the NSA is so busy protecting people is because they don't have a lot of money. I can only imagine how much this person will resent my shit in front of all the people that are just playing paintball!
93,8,"""You don't like wearing a mask because it is painful. Wearing a mask on a run is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."

99,9,"That's pretty fucking sick, and I don't think that's how it works unless you have a big family."
9,1,I can't believe you have to wear the mask when you have a virus. That is a really stupid and naive argument.

They walked the other side of the road, walked across the street, and walked back to the house for hours. I went back and the whole time I figured it was gonna happen again and then I found out that I really disliked the movie and said, hey, you were able to talk about my life while I wore a mask and keep distance and kept"
91,9,I don't think I see the problem with this. It's the mask that the NSA is trying to solve. It's a mask you're wearing in your everyday life.
99,9,They've put a bit of money in to try and get the government to help people.
9,1,Why wouldn't you wear a mask that doesn't contain any protections for yourself and the rest of your life?
9,4,This has essentially been a meme for years. You are a joker.

45,9,">Making a mask can help prevent the spread of a virus. In most states, wearing a mask can help prevent the spread of a virus."
47,9,"This is all a bit of a lie to me. I'm so proud of how much I've worked on it, but I've had no chance to go to see a doctor for a virulent disease. I just want to have the chance to see a doctor with someone I haven't seen before and I don't see any benefit in getting one of these things."
56,9,Vaccination is not the only vaccine available. Vaccination is not the only vaccine available.
79,9,The government seems to want to go to town and show that the people who live there have a real responsibility. Nope.
82,9,"Unless you're a person who is doing your job, then I think it's a terrible joke."
90,9,...And then she went on to have a good laugh.

99,9,"i like the movie. I can't understand how people wouldn't have a good time with a friend who wears a mask. i do appreciate the kind words, the 'why' and the fact that i wear a mask for the holidays. that is really all that matters."
9,1,Vaccination is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
9,4,> Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
9,6,"My friends used to wear them all the time, so we were not exactly the same. Now we wear a mask and we also don't have a mask. They also wear masks to keep out virulent diseases. It's not something we should take lightly and not that important. I just found out that I wore a mask so I wouldn't be sick from a virus."
11,9,"I have been on a plane that was completely destroyed by a virus. This is the same reason I can't find a proper reason to wear a mask if you're at a public park, so I have to stop in front of the CDC because it doesn't allow the plane to have a full-on 'vaccination' system. I have seen many cases where people wore a mask, and I'm surprised nobody has thought about them."
17,9,I think you're in an awkward position. The only person I can believe is the government.
18,9,The funny thing is you're joking because you can't explain it without you knowing the difference between wearing a mask and not having it. If I were your friend I'd just tell you what's up.
34,9,This article is one of the greatest articles I've ever read.
45,9,"I don't think there's a lot of information there, but it's a great idea."
47,9,"It is not a simple question because it is an example of people being able to use their authority to help and protect themselves while they are under the influence. It is a pretty clear concept, but the idea is one that is very common in both parts of the world."
56,9,Vaccination is not the only vaccine available. Vaccination is not the only vaccine available.
79,9,They're both really fucked up and not allowed to wear masks on Thanksgiving. What is wrong with that?

They're just a bunch of people with a mask who wear a mask and then just wear a mask and a mask, a little like a python."" mentality is so weird and a bit strange, I'm not even gonna go and talk to you, but if you're asking my opinion, it's pretty cool."
99,9,"I'm a med student, and I was reading a lot about wearing a mask for the holidays this year and if I was a child I would wear a mask too."
9,1,"I am not sure if you read the article, but the joke about the NSA is also the one that's being promoted."
9,4,I want to say something - like this is one of the greatest things ever written on this site.
9,6,'I hate it when people tell me how disgusting the NSA is about the fact that it's helping prevent the spread of a virus. I haven't done anything like this since I was a child and they've really gotten sick from the shit I've done. I know they hate it so I'll be very upset because I have never had to wear a tampon and it's not just about the fact that I'm an idiot because I can't even wear a mask
11,9,"Isn't a Vaccination Act a requirement for the federal government? Because they're illegal in many parts of the country, which is part of what is not mandatory if the U.S. government."
17,9,I’m sure the person I wrote this to probably knows more about the subject than me. I just don’t think it’s the government’s job.
18,9,>I have always urged people to wear the mask and wear it in emergencies.
34,9,I'd be willing to bet the CDC and the CDC are on to something.
45,9,Vaccination is about vaccines and vaccination is about spreading a virus.
47,9,"I'm very confused by this. I think it is just a pretty easy way to prevent a virus from getting into your body. It is a very common way for people to vaccinate themselves, but in an unregulated environment."
56,9,"I love the word mask, but this shit is so annoying I just can’t sit there and enjoy it. Wearing a mask helps in stopping the spread of a virus. You... I'm a bit of a fucking joke. That's really pretty crazy. Wearing a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend over Please"
79,9,That's not really a red flag.
82,9,I'm going to have to be frank and say it's the only way the government should do their job.
90,9,> Is this a video that we have no idea where to start?
91,9,This is my favorite part of the NSA. I know that my environment has very little social interaction with other people. Wearing a mask to stop the spread of a virus.
99,9,It is a good idea.
9,1,It sounds to me like you’re an asshole.
9,4,I hate it when people tell me how disgusting the NSA is about the fact that it's helping prevent the spread of a virus.

9,6,"You're very confused about the question ""Did I even see you running miles across Florida right now?"""
11,9,"Vaccination Act doesn't need a law for a federal government. It only needs a a federal government. You don't have to vaccinate everyone, you just have to wear a mask."
17,9,So what was the issue when the government stopped the spread of the virus?
18,9,I've never read the movie before so I'm not sure how the joke is appropriate.
34,9,"I am not a scientist, but I do have a papilloma, which is a serious, serious disease."
45,9,> It's not a joke. It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
47,9,Is that all that's left of it?
56,9,The biggest problem with wearing a mask is that it doesn't really address the issue that is spreading.
79,9,i think that one of the big reasons why people need to go to a rally is to show that they have a real responsibility. Nope
82,9,I don't see the point in letting the people get offended by a joke without first thinking about it.
90,9,I'm on mobile so I didn't see the title and he didn't reply because he said he'd be slapstick and he thought the rehash would be funny.
91,9,"So the government is threatening to extort money from the people that actually need to buy the virus? It isn't a war, it's a conspiracy."
99,9,This is one of the most important reasons for my life to rely on masks.
9,1,"I don't want to talk about it, but the reason for me thinking about it is because I'm scared of being attacked by the NSA, which is why I didn't want to wear my mask to protect my own health."
9,4,> Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.That's not really a red flag.
9,6,It sounds like it might be a silly joke. It sounds like it might be a joke.
11,9,This is a joke. I really don't see the point of wearing a mask when I'm sick.
17,9,"The government is using the word ""arachnid"" when its in a nutshell."
18,9,"I wore a mask for my birthday last year. I was born with a virus, and I still wear it for me even when I'm not running."
34,9,I think it's a prank. I have a few comments like this that I've never heard before. They're all very serious.
45,9,"I was thinking about how a mask would prevent the spread of a virus, and I thought ""That's a joke."""
47,9,Yes. If I'm in the situation of somebody being in a bad situation a doctor could possibly put up a mask to make sure there is no infection.
56,9,I read that on r/huffingtonpost. It's just so damn funny to see people think it's the only way to stop people from getting sick.
79,9,'Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus'
82,9,"It doesn't matter what the joke is if it's not a joke, it's a joke. The joke is just a joke."
90,9,"I think the funny part is that it's kind of weird for me to have this kind of experience. The person who wants to do it, will probably think ""a prank doesn't work"" if they're going to go and have a slapstick prank."
91,9,"So, what does the NSA stand for?"
99,9,"> You should wear a mask, because that's more likely to go downhill."
9,1,It doesn't matter what the joke is if it's not a silly joke. It sounds like it might be a joke.
9,4,I don't think there is anything wrong with a mask. It's a joke and that doesn't sound like a real thing.
9,6,I wear a mask because I think I would be better off just playing it safe without wearing it when I'm sick.
11,9,"We are being manipulated. The masks are being made as a joke, by the CDC. It's not a joke that it's going to be a joke."
17,9,So basically you have a python and a python costume...
18,9,"""I am a little bit in the minority but a lot of my family wear masks in the midst of a virus. Wearing a mask on a run is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask on a run is part of the measures deployed by the government. It sounds like the CDC is focusing on helping prevent this."
34,9,">I don't think he knows what it is, so it's a very dumb joke. I think it's a prankster."
45,9,"It's not just for the government to help stop the spread of a virus. It's for the public to be aware of the risks. Unless he was a huge prankster in the prank, the government would not have made that joke and would have snooped down the line to explain to him what the joke is about."
47,9,"You are not the one bringing it up, but your body isn't the one."
56,9,"This is why we have the ""flash bans"" and the ""infected"" button on our phone. You need to be able to tell who is out of the country when you clap in your vebs. It's not ""good"" to say ""we don't wear a mask"" so it's ""i'm a bit of a fucking joke."" It's just stupid that people do this. It's just silly."
79,9,I was about to post this to r/posts-ask-what-is-this-is-?
82,9,"This is why people like the idea of this subreddit, because you can't get past this joke in the first place."
90,9,I think it's funny because he's pranking you to try to get someone to help.
91,9,That's an interesting and valid point.
99,9,It isn't like it's on the front page of a website.
9,1,I don't think it's a joke.
9,4,"As the author of this subreddit said, the people who would think they are an idiot for wearing a mask are people who do it in an attempt to make themselves feel safer. So I think it's funny that he is pranking you to try to get someone to help."
9,6,I don't really care who is the victim.
11,9,It's the only place you're going to get to experience a shit-and-tear thing about the NSA.
17,9,You have a python costume! It's all pretty awesome! It looks like you're really into python-like things and your face is very shiny and attractive. I like this a lot!
18,9,I'm not sure if the CDC is focusing on the virus or not. But what does that have to do with the CDC. This post seems to be a very serious one.
34,9,"I am a doctor and wear masks with a lot of friends who aren't doctors, but they were all vaccinated."
45,9,Isn't there some shit that is actually a joke that he doesn't care about or even care about?
47,9,">But in the face of such things, you just have to choose between them and not get it. Despite their seemingly simple approach to health and anti-virus prevention, they will still not use a mask to prevent it."
56,9,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.This is a good one, it is funny and it is not just about the mask. I'm not gonna lie, I do know the cynicism that's at play here."
79,9,"That's the simplest and most arrogant thing I've read in a while, but I would probably rename it to a ""hug hat"" type thing. It's the simplest form of sarcasm."
82,9,"Unless the police don't want to hear what he was being offended by, then I think it's a terrible joke."
90,9,"You think ""'you think if you don't like this, then you might have some other issues : That's the whole point of a prank. What's the whole point of a prank. What's a prank. The thing about a prank is the one that does it and the one that isn't. I think it's kind of weird for me to have this kind of experience. The person who wants to do it, will probably think ""a prank"" if they're going to do it with the"
91,9,"Nope, nope, nope."
99,9,"There are many types of masks. There's a one-of-a-kind one for those who are genuinely concerned about the spreading of the virus, but there is a more naive one for those who are worried about it."
9,1,"Nope, nope. It's a joke."
9,4,">But in the face of such things, you just have to choose between them and not get it."
9,6,"> But in the face of such things, you just have to choose between them and not get it."
11,9,This is a very smart joke.
17,9,"The point isn't to prevent the spread of a virus, it's to prevent a virus from spreading, it's to prevent it from spread."
18,9,I am not a conservative. The whole 'Penguin Prank' thing is a joke that's trying to get the government to stop the spread of a virus.
34,9,I don't think the CDC is trying to get the government to stop the spread of a virus.
45,9,"I was the one who got a vaccination in December that was all about a different kind of vaccine. When I got it, it was on my hand to take off a shirt in case I got infected, which was the first thing that happened after the virus was stung on the shirt. I was at the party for a week. I thought I was a joker, but I didn't know it was a meme. My doctor was really upset when I realized that it was part of the precautions to prevent the spread of a virus. I was still tripped out"
47,9,Vaccination is about prevention. It is also a kind of anti-viral.
56,9,This is the most hilarious quote ever.
79,9,"> ""Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."""
82,9,"You have a strong point, but I don't think you're overreacting. This is a joke i have no way of getting past, and the people who don't do it don't have any way of doing their jobs."
90,9,"i think it's funny because he's pranking you to try to get someone to help. The person who wants to do it, will probably think ""a prank"" if they're going to do it with the 'I like a prank' that's about me running a marathon, but my friends have been to Orlando and to come home to the house in the same time they run with me. It's the same thing with a prank on a teenager."
91,9,There's a wikipedia page about this on /r/reddit about something like this: [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME]

84,10,It's really a shame they took you to a drive up test. The problem with that is that people haven't realized how important wearing a mask is in the health and safety of others. This is why people have such huge issues.

10,4,> I'm a doctor

I have found that they are the best method of preventing it because I know people who haven't tried it yet and have a feeling that a virus is spreading.

45,10,Vaccination is about vaccines and vaccination is about spreading a virus.
54,10,It's an interesting fact that I have a lot of respect for the president of my country because he is very much a troll. Especially the ones that are in the position to go after him with the same excuse.

I am not a lawyer, but I can help you. It sounds like you need to go to your doctor and see if your child is getting vaccines or not. This is not a government-funded initiative, it is part of the government-funded initiative. It's more like a federal health care system, or a state based one."
44,10,> The best thing is to go to a doctor who has a history of a virus.
45,10,Assuming the comments in this thread are really true. I think it's time to move on.

77,10,Using the word 'I don't think it's so weird to think people actually wear masks.'
80,10,I was thinking the same thing. A lot of people have been to that kind of medical emergency where they don't get a medical mask or even a medical device but aren't very familiar with the disease. And it is very common for people to come into the hospital without a mask or anything like that to keep their immune systems protected.

37,10,"What's going on here is not to mention how sick the country is, it is to prevent the spread of disease, and to try to prevent other people from doing it."

84,10,I'm a cynic and my husband is not a lawyer.
87,10,I know that the point of a rant is to tell you to keep it on. Wearing a mask outside while vaccinated is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

90,10,"I don't know where this guy was from, but I think you're describing the kind of people who are trying to arouse the public. It's not that much fun to do that, but I also don't think it's smart to try to convince them to do it when they can't do it without having to ask for a handshake or something."

32,10,"What's your job? I'm sorry but I can't do this. If it isn't yours then you can't do it. The only way to prevent a virus outbreak is to help your husband. You can't do this, and you'll have to have to put up with it. But I think the fact that he doesn't like it on Thanksgiving is a real issue."
37,10,I'm really sorry but that's not my situation. Having a bad day isn't a bad thing and I really feel like I have to go to the doctor.
44,10,"The government is not an authority. It's a snazzy meme based on a slapstick meme that the government has a right to make people wear masks. You need to change your mask to one that is on a table, with a mirror on it. What is the problem with this?"

10,4,Is it in any way necessary to get your life back on track?
15,10,"Is it the fact that people are being manipulated? It's not a joke to me, and it's not really a joke to me."

37,10,"It was a joke! I love it. It’s so easy to have it wrong, but it doesn’t help at all. The only reason I ever do that is to protect my family and get them to wear a mask. It has no idea what it means or what it means or what the government wants them to do. I just don’t care about what the public is seeing and what the government needs for that. It’s more important than knowing someone’s place of existence. I just don’t like it. I’m sure he doesn’t want to give him the benefit"
44,10,"The NSA is the official authority on vaccinations in the United States. It's a joke if you're sick of it, but its not a good idea."

54,10,">He doesn’t have the right to do it. His comment is the one to start, not a troll. I don’t like the idea of being a politician."
59,10,"It's a bit ironic and trite as well, I'm just saying. I think the CDC is trying to undermine their policy on vaccinating kids without first trying to make sure they aren't doing something shady."
77,10,People with masks wear them because they want to be in the public eye and they don't want to be seen. The only way to get it off is if they see it coming and the prankster is lying.
80,10,"I'd bet that you don't have a phobia. But then again, I don't understand how people get this way with a phobia. There's a good chance that the idea would be funny, and I think that's part of the point of the joke."
84,10,i don't think this makes sense. I just think it seems like a really bad joke to me.
87,10,"Yes, a lot of people are still using a mask. If you don't have an adult that will be able to vaccinate you, then the mask is your best shot."
88,10,"I wear a mask for protection when I do this, and it makes me more comfortable. It's the way to help you."
90,10,I think they have to be kidding themselves. It was just a joke.
91,10,>(http://www.r/reddit.com/r/reddit/posts/2009/06/2/The-Dissistance-Band-Proved-Suppression) It sounds like the guy is an old CIA agent. What the NSA is doing is a horrible idea.

97,10,"It is the idiomatic part, but the point here is that the government is a tyrant. This means that you must put up with the sexist jokes that they give you."
10,2,"He had to leave because the government is trying to prevent HIV/AIDS, he needs to move on to a different job."
10,4,So this NSA agent says something sexist about the CDC.
15,10,"A person isn't a prankster, he's a politician who believes that 'the government needs to stop'."
16,10,"I don't know where I'm getting the idea that this is a sarcastic premise. You say this because it's funny? I mean, it's funny, but it makes me cringe and think it's actually funny. This is what it is."
17,10,I don't think it's a good joke. It seems like you're trying to be clever.
18,10,"It's like you could run around with a camera on your head and say oh ""Make a prank, I'm not gonna do that."" But you are in the minority. If you are a prankster, I am sure you know what you mean. I'm sure you don't. I'm not that conservative. Is that just a joke?"
28,10,"[Hey, I just saw you are running miles across florida right now curious if you would share what is the route I am in orlando and would love to come with you even if just for a mile i d wear a mask and keep distance."
32,10,"A lot of what people are going to say about wearing a mask is what they are trying to say. It is also illegal for people to wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus. The government, not the people, is allowed to have it on and not use it. So it is a good idea, but it is not what they intended to be. I'm not a doctor."
37,10,That's hilarious. I've heard this one before:
44,10,I don't think he's really into that.
45,10,">I think people are overreacting. It is legal in the US, where doctors have no rights to prescribe them and therefore they are allowed to wear any form of mask they wish to be prescribed."
54,10,"I just read this last week in a book about a person who goes to work to keep a mask. I've never read that book. It makes me very, very uncomfortable."
59,10,"I'm a doctor. The CDC is responsible for the costs of vaccines, and so is any federally mandated government. So they need to be made a part of their funding policy."
77,10,Is it possible that they will wear a hoodie or some other costume that actually does the work? Is there a way they can put a hoodie on when the people they want to be in the public eye aren't being aware of what a python is?
80,10,I think a lot of people who have a phobia feel a lot more secure when they are in contact with the virus. It's not a joke.
84,10,"Despite the NSA's threats, it doesn't appear to be working."
87,10,"""I'm not afraid to be a doctor. I don't think it's a big deal. I'm sorry if I came across that way, but if you had a great laugh, I would've remarked. I'm not shy? That is your problem."""
88,10,"I don't see how you can rely on that. This is about keeping the health of your body intact, especially the vaccinated."
90,10,"i like a prank that's about me running a marathon, but my friends have been to Orlando and to come home to the house in the same time they run with me"
91,10,"The whole idea of doing this in a public environment that is not safe is a little strange. It's not even the NSA, so he's not an asshole. He was a fool."
96,10,wearing a mask and bend and bend and bend and bend and bend and bend
97,10,"So what do you mean ""I want to wear a mask and the sexist jokes that they give me?"""
10,2,It is a joke.... not a prank.
10,4,"Having a hoodie on and saying ""Make a prank, I'm not gonna do that"" is a pretty bad idea. It's not funny because it's on your head - it's just a prank. It's not that it's funny because it's funny because people who can't make a joke about it and whatnot aren't going to listen to it - or at least not see it as a joke."
15,10,A prankster and a politician at the same time.
16,10,I believe it's funny and just that it's part of the government's mission to stop the spread of the AIDS/AIDS virus.
17,10,This is a joke. This is an asshole joke.
18,10,I think people who are like this aren't being naive or in a funny way at all.
28,10,It sounds like a symptom of the disease being diagnosed and being vaccinated by the CDC. And it is a joke.
32,10,"I don't really think this is a prank, it's a joke."
37,10,"I'm sorry, but I've heard this one before: ""I think you need to go to your doctor and see if your child is getting vaccines or not."
44,10,"This sounds like a lot of work to you. I am not going to lie here, I'm not going to write an entire novel about the government. It's a really long piece of work to do, I think."
45,10,"I'm not a fan of the jokes, but I think it's time to move on."
54,10,Vaccinations are not the way to stop the spread of a virus.
59,10,The government has already spent a lot of money on the NSA and its hat. They are doing this for fear of the public health disasters. I think I understand what you are saying a bit but isn't a medical scientist?
77,10,"I think that there are a lot of different versions of ""Potentially evil in a group, a person who loves to fuck people with a python, will be sick, and would never be able to go to a hospital and be infected."""
80,10,It's a joke.
84,10,"I feel for you, though."
87,10,"I’m so sorry to say this, but I think this is the worst part of the whole thing. I hate putting my face in the mirror because of it."
88,10,I feel like my mother in law who has had a body that shaves like 2 o'clock in the morning.
90,10,"I'm a prankster, and I slapped a slapstick prank on myself after a prank, but I've learned that I'm probably not on the best of habits. This might be the same thing with people running around in disguise (for example, if I'm running in the bathroom or something)."
91,10,"A lot of people here are so young, i'd like to know why these things are happening....I'd consider a mask on the sidewalk or in a public area and make it a point to wear one as soon as possible ""We have an agenda to disenfranchise people. The NSA is concerned with how its working to disenfranchise people....and they probably wouldn't mind if they don't think they are infected."", ""But the worst part of this is..."
96,10,"When you get a good, clean or clean and have a full set of masks, you can't just wear one over the whole thing."
97,10,"So you're saying that when you're on the street and you're thinking ""Well, I don't know why people wear a mask. But I think I'm going to go on and on and on and on. I just want to be on my knees and say I want to go on and on and on."""

35,11,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
44,11,"They are saying people need to wear masks, or they should wear them to prevent the spread of a virus."
62,11,Isn't that the only excuse to wear a mask on a flight?
67,11,It's an exercise in personal safety to keep people away from people.
77,11,"yep, they have a right to not wear a mask, but they have no right to not wear it"
86,11,"I don't think that wearing a mask or helmet will have a positive effect. I like it for many reasons. Those being said, it is not a sarcastic thing to say and not a positive."

11,4,"yep, they have a right to not wear a mask, but they have no right to not wear it. I like it for many reasons."
11,9,In the UK you can get a vaccinated mask and you can use it to keep yourself safe.
21,11,"This shit happens so much that if it's on a computer that's going to get sent to the local doctor to get vaccinated, that it's hard to get it."
34,11,"""We are looking forward to an update with the CDC about the effectiveness of this legislation. Isn't wearing a mask part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus? Because no."
35,11,Hey! What's up? We're here to help you! Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
44,11,"They are saying people need to wear masks, or they should wear them to prevent the spread of a virus."
62,11,Wearing a mask in public is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
67,11,I'm in the U.S. and i just can't get my eyes from the sun unless it rains. I've been getting sick the last few days so it's difficult to stay afloat on it.
77,11,"I don't think it's a lie, but if he wants to be, then it's a lie."
86,11,It's like it is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
93,11,Sadly we have not had enough to eat as of late and it's been very painfully traumatic. This is not true. This is a good analogy for a bunch of things that are done for the most part.
11,1,We have a few rules. I'm sorry to hear that. I don't understand why people need to wear a mask to stop a virus. They've been on the same plane.
11,4,"There is a very good article about this. In this case, it states that they are ineffective, but that they can do so."
11,9,"I think you know that it is part of the legislation. It is part of the legislation, it is also part of the legislation, it is part of the legislation. It is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
21,11,"> Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.Go for it, then come on and let me know how it goes. I'll be at the public park. A neo nazism will not be as successful in stopping a pandemic, they just want to make sure their bodies stay strong enough to survive."
34,11,The fact that a public health officer is unable to tell the difference between a federal and federal mandate is pretty interesting.
35,11,"> In the US, it's called a mask, and it is basically just a safety feature that is only used to keep people away from viruses."
44,11,"In Canada I wear a mask that I keep on to wear when I go out and not to wear a mask. I like to wear them because I am a very caring, caring, and compassionate person."
62,11,Is there a medical or religious reason why you wouldn't wear a mask on a flight? I've never seen people wear masks. It's just not necessary.
67,11,"I'd like to say the worst part is the fact that the ""I'm not allowed to be vaccinated by law"" is the one that's been around forever. It's a slur, it's no fun, and it makes me happy. It's a good feeling."
77,11,"Its not a good idea to run a marathon or go to the races. If he gets attacked by a superspy, he'll wear a mask."
86,11,Wearing a mask or helmet that will protect you from corona and that everyone would have to wear to go outside for a month or that would allow us to open up the economy again?
93,11,"It is pretty clear the government did not try to stop the spread of the virus. They supposedly tried to prevent it by eliminating the use of a mask, but they decided to allow the other people to use a mask."
11,1,CANNOTANSWER: The problem is that when people try to protect themselves from the spread of a virus they will lose consciousness and the person who can be on a flight will be able to tell they are safe. If people are in a safe place the people on the flight are not able to protect themselves and their families from viruses. It is one thing to not wear a mask or to not use a mask but to not be vulnerable.
11,4,Is there a medical or religious reason why people wouldn't wear a mask on a plane?
11,9,"I have been on a plane that was completely destroyed by a virus. This is the same reason I can't find a proper reason to wear a mask if you're at a public park, so I have to stop in front of the CDC because it doesn't allow the plane to have a full-on 'vaccination' system. I have seen many cases where people wore a mask, and I'm surprised nobody has thought about them."
21,11,The NSA and the government are both the only ones that can do anything about the infection and you don't have to have any vaccines.
34,11,"> ""We are looking forward to an update with the CDC about the effectiveness of this legislation. Isn't wearing a mask part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
35,11,I haven't heard of a man who was vaccinated. What is the point of a mask? Is it that the person is vaccinated versus the doctor?
44,11,"Yes. But don't wear a mask at work. You have to be very caring, caring, and compassionate to not wear a mask. Especially if you've gotta wear it when you're out with friends."
62,11,"You're not wearing a mask, you're wearing a mask. It's really not necessary. People seem to like wearing a mask and not want to think about how nice it is for their health. Wearing a mask in public doesn't help in stopping the spread of a virus. It's just not necessary. People seem to like wearing a mask and not want to think about how nice it is for their health."
67,11,People who are not vaccinated have been vaccinated.
77,11," You must be a pretty clever guy. A friend of mine who was able to do this a few years back sneezed in his face, but now I feel like it was just a joke"
86,11,"""We're going to end this fight by removing these masks from the airspace and instigating it,"" says a CDC spokesman (which the NSA doesn't). The NSA is trying to find a way to prevent people from being ""sick"" and dying. The idea that we all need to be safe and in the right is something you have to acknowledge when you talk about your own morals."
93,11,"Ahhh that makes sense. I thought it was kind of a silly joke on a joke I'd just say, I don't think the government has anything to do with this. A virus can spread all over the country. It's just that you aren't the only one who has put yourself at risk. Wearing a mask on a run is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
11,1,"I've been on a plane that was completely destroyed by a virus, and it makes me very sad. Its so sad how people wear a mask in public and how bad it is that I have to have to wear a mask and I still have to go outside and be safe. But I just don't see what the NSA has to do."
11,4,It's actually a joke. It's an article. It's written by an apologist who wrote the article. And they don't really want to answer it.
11,9,"Isn't a Vaccination Act a requirement for the federal government? Because they're illegal in many parts of the country, which is part of what is not mandatory if the U.S. government."
21,11,It's about a lack of awareness and an increase in the number of people who do it.
34,11,What’s the point of wearing a mask when people are sick and trying to find out who to vaccinate?
35,11,They make a really good joke about it.
44,11,"I am actually just sick of wearing a mask at work and unable to see if I'm safe. Its really sad that so many people aren't wearing a mask at work, if not even at work, and when you are out and about, you're being so selfish. I think there's a difference between the two, but you are a bit over sensitive and I can't imagine what that can be."
62,11,"There's only so much that goes into a mask. You know what they say when you are having a fight, if the fucking virus is going to be spread, it's not a fucking fight. That's the worst. It's a fight with his dog, if his dog gets sick and your husband gets sick and you're afraid. It's not the healthiest thing you can do to fuck the virus and that's the fucking worst thing you could do to fucking the fucking"
67,11,"I've seen an article a couple times about the issue of how people can be vaccinated. They are not supposed to wear them as a reason, because they aren't allowed to use them as a way to prevent the spread of a virus. They need to see a doctor about it."
77,11,He's a fool. What's your point. The point of wearing a mask is to let people see you.
86,11,"We can't live without being stung by a virus... the NSA is just making it a threat to save us. If NSA's a scumbag and wants to use its power, then they are doing it."
93,11,"That's a funny way of putting it. This is a joke that is so infuriating that it's going to end with a ""to be ashamed of myself"" type joke."
11,1,CANNOTANSWER: The problem is that when people try to protect themselves from the spread of a virus they will lose consciousness and the person who can be on a flight will be able to tell they are safe.
11,4,"It's not a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. I see no reason to wear a mask when I'm sick and I don't even think of it as a bad thing, and a good reason to make the NSA more ineffective. This isn't a joke. It's a joke. I really don't see any reason why people shouldn't wear a mask in public when they are sick and need to know who to vaccinate."
11,9,"Vaccination Act doesn't need a law for a federal government. It only needs a a federal government. You don't have to vaccinate everyone, you just have to wear a mask."
21,11,I was a doctor and always tried to wear a mask because I wanted to see what I could see. Then when I tried to get vaccinated they went back to the doctor to explain. So I said that to the doctor and then asked him for a prescription to get vaccinated. I also said that I tried to get a prescription on my own when I had already started and was told that it was because I didn't think about a prescription. They said they were essentially saying I had an asthma attack.
34,11,"This isn't an official word, it's just a common joke."
35,11,In a nutshell: you don't suck at that.
44,11,"> I do know it's not the NSA, which is based on a slapstick meme. The government in Texas isn't allowed to wear masks, because the people claiming they are sick are fucking the government. It's not a legitimate argument for the government to protect the sick from a virus. It's not a legitimate argument for the government to protect the sick from a virus."
62,11,"I was reading a great article about the anti-virus campaign, where he said that he was going to have to wear a mask if he wanted his vebb to be healthy, and they said he is wearing a mask on his birthday, to stop a virus from spreading on him."
67,11,"I would love to read an article about this to see if anyone actually knows that the government has no obligation to prevent people from getting vaccinated in order to prevent people from getting sick and dying, and they need a doctor."
77,11,>He's a fool. What's your point. The point of wearing a mask is to allow someone to see you.
86,11,You're a nutcase. The CDC is really only trying to keep the virus from spreading.
93,11,"In the US we do not have the right to wear a mask if it is the right time to get shattered. The virus isn't in our control right now, the government has never been able to prevent it, they have decided to just allow it. Basically, they are just being manipulated."
11,1,I don't understand why people need to wear a mask to stop a virus.
11,4,"I'm not sure how that's an actual joke, but the NSA is not supposed to be a threat to people because it is not a legitimate threat to a person."
11,9,This is a joke. I really don't see the point of wearing a mask when I'm sick.
21,11,"> ""The truth about wearing a mask is about a lack of awareness and an increase in the number of people who do it."""

Wearing a mask in a very tight, tight room is what is intended to keep your family safe, and it's a good idea to protect yourself."

67,11,There is a government mandate for vaccination to happen. This one is just for the sake of the American public. There are no laws about that.
77,11,"You're not the first person to say ""I don't think it's so weird that the word ""prank"" is so used here. It means ""you need to get him to wear the mask!"" It's not a prank. It's just a joke."

Then again I can't seem to come back after my first bite of the papilloma, and I would wear a mask when they get sick."

86,12,The US government has made it very clear that a mask or helmet does not protect us from corona. So I can't imagine santa wearing a mask in thanksgiving would have been so powerful and so powerful and so powerful. I would imagine it would be much easier for us to break the law and act like a socialist if they didn't use it.

It was actually used to describe a pandemic, which is a condition of the immune system that may have been linked with the pandemic. The CDC has a a program to help protect the population from pandemics because there is a lot of people can't prevent it,"
76,12,I'm gonna start making jokes about it.
77,12,I can't get a lot of people to think that wearing a mask is a prank.
79,12,This is the first time I've heard someone comment on the US government... and I don't understand.
86,12,I can't think of anything to avoid the virus.
89,12,"It makes me feel like I'm running for the CDC, because I'm so busy. I'm just not feeling like I'm getting enough sleep to care for someone else's health, and I'm really trying to make my health even more important to everyone's health. It's the reason I can't wear a mask, I'm a bit too sick and the other people I know that aren't so well prepared."
91,12,"I am a non-medical scientist - my wife's mom has been on a vaccine for a while now and has a facial mask, I don't think I can be a good doctor, and I'd like to help her figure it out."
93,12,A narcissist who shatters on a run is not in for the most fucking misinformed joke in the history of humanity.
96,12,The 'wearing a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over
21,12,">I am not an advocate of AIDS, but a liar."
34,12,This is a joke based on the fact that you are trying to get the government to stop the spread of a virus.
37,12,I'm not a doctor. I'm a doctor. It's an opinion. And a joke. I have no idea what the CDC is talking about. Is it possible that a doctor is trying to keep people from getting HIV because of a vaccine? Is that a joke? Is this a joke? Does it make any sense that the person that's promoting HIV is wearing a mask to help keep people from getting HIV because of it? Or is there some sort of thing they're talking about?
44,12,People have a huge problem with the government. They are not the solution. People want to be more vigilant and protect themselves. It's a good idea.
51,12,"It's not an actual joke. It's a simplest form of sarcasm. The only time someone is using a mask is if they think the CDC is doing something about it, they do a joke. They should wear a mask. A mask should prevent people from getting sick from a virus. A couple of sham jokes in my post here. Why would it be a good idea to wear a mask to keep myself safe, but I don't think that is the right way to act."
54,12,">The reason people are not getting vaccinated is because they think it is. If they are, then it is not a good idea."
58,12,I don't think they understand the issue. It sounds like a logical conclusion.
66,12,"I like the idea of wearing a mask while vaccinating my kids, but I think the entire idea is ridiculous, and it's not like there's any way it's not possible for people to wear it, and it's a prank. Basically, the problem is if you aren't a doctor, you don't even need to wear a mask, it's just a prank, and it's a prank."
75,12,"There is a lot of pranks. I guess your response is a little different from my previous comment. I don't think I have ever dated a CDC agent who didn't seem to know how to properly protect the public from pandemics. I think you should also mention that the CDC's program is intended to stop pandemics, and it's supposed to prevent pandemics, so you might see it as an extension of a prank, but also a prank and say what you have, I've been told before"
76,12,I don't think this is a joke. It's a blatant attempt to take away a virus. It's not about prevention. It's about prevention.
77,12,"In addition to all these things that were mentioned before, you also mentioned the fact that I love the word prank."
79,12,"This is how we keep up the ""mistakes""."
86,12,It's very possible that the anti-semetic drugs and anti-viral medications are to prevent the spread of these drugs.
89,12,"I think you need to read ""Dr. Johns, you will have to talk to the other guy and make a good decision about the mask,"" then you will have to say something along the lines of ""I like your idea of wearing a mask and how to do it."""
91,12,There's no one who wants to talk about the NSA and isn't going to listen.
93,12,"My boyfriend is doing a similar thing to me - he wears a mask on the run. It's hard to tell when a virus is spreading and it has a pronounced negative effect on him, which is why I'm worried about him. I don't think the government is responsible for the spread of viruses. I would rather not be wearing a mask."

21,12,That is a joke. It is about a lack of awareness and an increase in the number of people who do it. It is not a joke.
34,12,>I think the only joke I get out of this is that the CDC has some form of safety protocol where you can be seen by a mask. I like it because it's easy to get sick and the CDC knows everything about it.
37,12,If someone wears a mask on their birthday they will get sick. If they're not using a mask to protect themselves they'll get sick too. If they don't they will get sick. If they're not using a mask they'll get sick.
44,12,I'm in Texas and I have a very serious phobia of people.
51,12,The CDC is not a 'pill' thing.
54,12,"I don't want to think about the whole ""sapping virus"" thing, but I think that it is really ridiculous. You know, what's the point of a mask?"

It's a little hard to tell when your face isn't shattered by a virus. The problem isn't the mask. It's the innuendo."
66,12,"""I want to tell you this, I'm not a doctor and I'm not a doctor. I want to tell you this, I'm not a doctor and I'm not a doctor."
75,12,"I think it's just a joke, a bit of a prank."
76,12,Wearing a mask helps to protect yourself. This is why I'm a big person.
77,12,People who wear a mask will wear them because they think they're going to be abused. They're still victims of snobbery and they will be killed.
79,12,"I'm so sorry, but I'm not a conservative. I am a Republican."
86,12,"The NSA is doing a lot of wrong things, but it isn't a great idea."
89,12,"It's a good way of making your friends feel good, but a bad way to bring up your own issues, and make friends that will be as happy as they can be."
91,12,The NSA does not want to eat up the time they need to have a problem with public space. They do have a problem with having people outside of their room without being allowed to wear their masks.

59,13,When I visited Tx I found out that a number of things were happening on the scene - one of them was a group of sick kids who came to their local park because they thought it was a good idea to wear a mask.
61,13,This is why I feel bad for my country for being a free country.
72,13,I was very sick from having to get the mask on because I didn't even know the mask acted like a dummy.

44,13,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.It's funny that so many people in the U.S. don't wear a mask at their job, but there's a very glaring difference between them and the other one."

47,13,A lot of people don't care for what a virus looks like. The only thing that isn't useful is the virus.
59,13,"The most important part of this story in my experience is that you can't just wear a mask for the purpose of preventing someone from getting sick if they are vaccinated. I mean, I mean, I'm not sure what's wrong, but I'm definitely sure there's a better way to look out for the fap test in the US."

I'm sorry if I am wrong, but I don't think it would be much easier for us to break the law and act like a socialist if they didn't use this."
13,5,So what do you think of the fact that the government doesn't want to get a vaccinated person on the list because she was on the list for a few years?
18,13,Is a mask a tool used to prevent virus infection?
22,13,"I have always admired how people have changed over the years. I have a mask to protect me from being killed, but that is because it can be worn to keep me from being bitten. I've seen some people with a mask before. They are also able to do things while I'm flying. They know that they are sexy, but not for a long time.

45,13,"It's about how the government protects our health - and yours, as well as the other problems the public faces with vaccines."
47,13,You gotta be very careful in the face of the CDC.
59,13,"This is a bit ironic and trite as well, I'm just saying. I think the CDC is trying to undermine their policy on vaccinating kids without first trying to make sure they aren't doing something shady."
61,13,I think this post is a good one to start.
72,13,>I think the real problem with wearing a mask is that it doesn't really address the issue that is spreading.
73,13,I've heard a couple of these people and their husband's wives say it isn't the right thing to do. The fact that they aren't aware of the problem is just another example of what might be happening.

37,13,Isn't it the fact that you have to wear a mask while you are in the hospital? Because that's a bad idea.
44,13,I'm sure it would be funny to hear you have a mask because a woman whose body is covered in a red blood cell is causing it's own death.

Excellent exandle of the importance and reliance of everyone in the community to do their part the people that put themselves at risk everyday so you can have food safely produced and delivered to you to eat it s not hard to wear a mask on a run
15,6,Why did I say that? Because I was told that I am not on the right side of the fence and I don't want to put the whole shit in there.
15,7,Vaccines don't give you the full benefit of the doubt... This is the same person who said the government has a right to wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus.
15,10,"The government has a policy that they should wear a mask when traveling – it's used in the first place to protect people from the virus, but not in the first place."
18,15,"So a joke, a prank, a joke. And then a joke, a joke."
38,15,I personally know people that have gotten covid one of them past away this week please wear a mask. They have to wear a mask for this because they want to make others happy and make the people happy.
43,15,"Vaccinations are a major public health issue. You need to get a vaccinatation ASAP. You can't put a mask on everyone in your family, and they do a good job of keeping the people safe."
45,15,That is a funny thing to say. I can't even imagine how the government would want to stop that.
59,15,We are going to have to put on a mask. We will be using a mask.
60,15,"The government isn't supposed to use it for anything, they're supposed to wear a mask. The government isn't supposed to use it for anything.

69,15,'Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
70,15,"So I think it's a bit pathetic to think that the government should require people to wear masks in any way if they need to prevent spread of a virus. If a person didn't have their hands sterilized and put on a mask, then the government should have gotten the best of both worlds - a lot of the time you can't just take a mask to prevent the spread of a virus."

76,15,"There is no ""Vach"" in the US. It's not a virus, it's a health hazard."
80,15,The government wants people to wear masks and not just to stop them from spreading. The government wants them to wear a mask so it's not illegal for them to do that.
82,15,I can't believe the government has pushed this issue so hard. There isn't enough govt spending in the US right now to stop it.
89,15,"I think that because the virus is spreading by destroying it, there must be more people in the park and the better the people at the hospital may be."
91,15,Then get a face mask.
92,15,"You're absolutely right. There is no reason to fear a virus spreading to anyone without the health care, and it has been proven in the US to be much more effective than any other vaccine."
93,15,"I think that if the US had a long history of wearing masks, that people would have no problem at all having people like this."
15,6,What I'm trying to say is that the government has to wear a mask when traveling to prevent the spread of a virus. That's why they're so naive.
15,7,"No, not the only thing the US government does is require people to wear a mask."
15,10,It is possible for someone to become ill in some way from a bacterial infection. The vaccine should not have a direct impact on their brain.
18,15,"A lot of people don't wear masks. If you can't see through the camera you have to do a very specific job, in most cases you're better off just walking and watching movies in a dark environment."

45,15,"I've been sick of seeing this guy and his stuff all over the country, I'm not sure why he wears it."
59,15,"I'm not sure what that is, but that's not how this is going to play out. In addition to the laws on vaccinating, the government wants to have people cover themselves with a mask so it can help with the disease. I'm not sure why people don't wear a mask unless they get sick."
60,15,"The first post was just a joke, not a meme. The guy in the headline is saying that it was a symptom of a virus, and that wearing a mask and bend over means you are trying to stop it from spreading."
65,15,> Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
69,15,>The idea that we all need to be safe and in the right is something you have to acknowledge when you talk about your own morals.
70,15,"I like this meme so much that I don't even know if it was about me being covid but just a bit uncomfortable as the fact it makes me feel better. That’s really pretty crazy. I’m actually a bit of a vebbulldog, so i’m definitely going to wear a mask."
74,15,"I would have had a problem with this, it's a sad problem with our society, and it's not my thing."
76,15,"Wearing a mask and bend over is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I like to wear a mask and bend over so I don't wear a mask. Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
80,15,"I've heard that the government wants people to wear a mask and then pretending to be a doctor. I really think it's one of those scary things you can see on a TV show, but you can't just sit there and pretend like a doctor, you can't eat food, you can't take your life. I think you're doing a pretty good job of being an extreme dick."

91,15,"i think the most common dietary advice is to wear a mask, but the best one is to wear a face mask. In my opinion, the public needs to be better aware of what the people who play paintball like wear. If the government is able to stop it and isn't making the community aware of the effect, that's a big win."
92,15,The Vaccine that helps people to live a virulent life is a good one. The reason you're so sorry for this vaccine is because of the stigma surrounding it.

15,10,I really think the government is able to stop this issue. It is a good one. The idea that we all need to be safe and in the right is something you have to acknowledge when you talk about your own morals.
18,15,"I can see where you're coming from, but my point is that you would have to be more specific and if you would've asked for a different mask, it's probably going to have to be a much better one, but it could be a good compromise, too."
38,15,They have to wear a mask for this because they want to make others happy and make the people happy.
43,15,"He's a saboteurs for not being able to wear a mask. The truth is that he's trying to avoid being a saboteur, and is also just trying to be a saboteurs for not wearing a mask."
45,15,"This is about how the government protects our health - and yours, as well as the other problems the public faces with vaccines."
59,15,"It seems like it is something the US has been doing for a long time. The CDC has been trying to keep it as a policy and is now making some changes to it, like changing the laws for kids in the form of a fap test or something. It's very easy to make an attempt to make a policy that allows for the safety of the public."
60,15,I'm a guy in the Army and I do have a rash every time I'm out in public i'll go out and do stuff like that. Wearing a mask and bend over means you are trying to stop it from spreading.
65,15,"We gotta wear masks in the face of sickness or get infected, right?"
69,15,if it's not an in v v i don't think it's a joke that you have the right to wear a mask
70,15,This is a shame. I don’t care about people or their privacy. The government has no right to regulate the public health system.
74,15,There's always a problem with how we communicate. You are not going to know what's going on around you.
76,15,A virus can spread all over the country. It's just that you aren't the only one who has put yourself at risk.

80,15,A lot of people wear masks for their health to prevent infections that don't occur. It seems like the government has an agenda.
82,15,"I don't know how I could stop this, but if I was hacked into a wall like this I'd wear a mask a lot. But if I were to tell the police and make them leave. It would also get them to leave."
89,15,Unless you want to avoid all of that then the link...
91,15,"I know that a lot of things are very misleading, but what if we don't get it correctly?"
92,15,"I hate to sound a little sarcastic. I don't like to snoop on the guy I actually snooped on a few times. I'm pretty sure that a lot of the facts in this article are true, so I'm going to give you a good one, though."
93,15,The joke 'Wip a mask on a run to protect yourself if you don't'is a kind of a joke if you don't want to wear it '. I don't think it's wrong for people to wear masks and it's actually quite common for people to wear them. I've always wondered if this is the same as the joke in the article.
15,6,People can't know if this is a joke or not. You don't.
15,7,"This is how if you don't care about your privacy, you'll lose a person."
15,10,It's the same thing when you don't like to talk about your own morals.
18,15,The government is using you. It's the government that's trying to stop the spread of the virus.
38,15,"I know they are putting so much pressure on their mom, and she's being very jaded about him."

45,15,"It was a joke. This is about how the government protects our health and yours. People are making false claims to their health, which is why they refuse to take care of themselves."
59,15,"Is it possible to get the government to help people get vaccinated? If not, then that doesn't work."
60,15,I'm not going to lie: a virus can not cause an infection. I'm afraid that some kind of narcissists who doesn't understand the importance of wearing a mask can.
65,15,I think the issue with that is that a mask does not affect any other part of the population.
69,15,"No one is going to be able to go out with the truth, and it isn't a slapstick joke. It's a joke that's meant to hurt people. It's not a joke, and it's a joke if the reality isn't slapstick."
70,15,"So your doctor is giving you a headache, not knowing if you're infected with a virus or if it's just one bad virus, then you're infected?"
74,15,Why do people wear a mask when there is no research?
76,15,I think a few days ago the guy was having some sex with a guy who was like hey if you wanna wear a mask and bend your nose you can wear it.
80,15,> A lot of people wear masks for their health to prevent infections that don't occur. It seems like the government has an agenda.
82,15,A guy who hacked into a wall is actually very unlikely to ever realize the gov't is doing its job. It's also a joke that's utterly unjustified.
89,15,It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
91,15,"When people are not really using the word ""saddle a virus"", they are using a false name that says'saddle a virus, and', which isn't exactly a lie. It's not really a good idea to say it's spreading, and then in the future you will just see it. If you wear a mask, you may as well just take it off, like a rat."
92,15,"I'm not even sure what you mean. Honestly, that's not what a python can do. I can't see anything wrong with that."
93,15,"What is it? A mask, a mask, and a tan mask? A tan mask? What's it like wearing a mask?"
15,6,That's what they said. [It was a joke.
15,7,The government is just trying to do something to save lives.
15,10,It's not just a joke. The government is not.

43,15,"I'm on the road. But, if you're just looking to stay home, you're getting sick, and that's not a mask."
45,15,"I mean, a doctor wouldn't need to have a ""mask"" to protect someone else, but wearing a mask is a better way to prevent a virus. It's a joke. But it's not about preventing someone from getting the virus, it's about how to prevent it and how to save their lives."
59,15,"Vaccines can help prevent the spread of a disease, but they don't do it to stop the spread of the disease. You can't expect your children to get vaccinated, that's a completely unreasonable expectation that anyone in your family is going to get the papilloma virus."
60,15,"I can understand that the idea of not wearing a mask and bending over is very insidious and ignorant, but I don't understand why people think of wearing a mask as a way to help stop a disease. But I do understand why the idea that you need to wear a mask is a joke."
65,15,That's not going to get a lot of attention.
69,15,It's kind of a strange joke i know.
70,15,A person with a python mask probably doesn't know what a virus is.
74,15,I know what you mean. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
76,15,"I'm very thankful that the government wants to do more research into the spread of a virus, but they are not."

60,15,OP: I'm a guy in the Army and I do have a rash every time I'm out in public i'll go out and do stuff like that.
65,15,People in the government who are comfortable with wearing a mask are just using the idea of masks to prevent people from having a virus from coming into their home.
69,15,... he's being a joke in a nutshell.
70,15,This is what the CDC and CDC should be doing with the vaccination program.
74,15,I see a lot of people wearing masks. The first part of the post is a question - which seems obvious: how can you help them?
76,15,"I don't care why someone's asking you a question about ""This is a joke"" is so ridiculous that it makes no sense to say it in a way that would make it a joke."
80,15,A lot of people wear masks for their health to prevent infections that don't occur. It seems like the government has an agenda.
82,15,"I do like this one, but it seems to be a joke."
89,15,"I see the difference between a mask and an actual one, and you do have to be able to tell a person they have a problem with when they are at a running location. A 'route' is a term used to describe a line or object with a joke in it."
91,15,NSA isn't just a tool. They are a tool of the government. It isn't a joke. The government uses the NSA's surveillance methods to help prevent the spread of a virus.
92,15,"Despite the fact that that is not an opinion, there's no real reason to worry about it. A lot of people on the internet don't think that this vaccine is a viable solution and it's a way to protect people, and it's more about the government than the person's health, not whether or not it's effective."
93,15,There's an important difference between the first and last sentence in this article. There is no joke about how people are being manipulated in a way that doesn't even involve masks.
15,6,"""We're being a joke, this is a joke"""
15,7,Is that what the article is about?
15,10,"Is it the fact that people are being manipulated? It's not a joke to me, and it's not really a joke to me."
18,15,As a prankster who's always been stoked that the government's trying to stop the spread of viruses.
38,15,He said you're not a troll. He was joking.
43,15,I don't care where the word for it comes from.
45,15,It's a joke. And it does not mean shit. It's a joke that it isn't just for a vaccine promoting government policies.
59,15,I'm also a pediatrician who was raised in a similar situation with my friends. I was vaccinated but it never became effective because a mask doesn't work because it faps. I was taught this by a doctor and was told that it doesn't work because if I smoked it I would be dead.
60,15,> I think the government needs to stop. They need to stop. They need to stop. The government needs to stop. They need to stop. They need to stop.

80,15,It seems like the government has an agenda. It seems like the government isn't really doing its job. There's no reason they shouldn't stop the fucking.

15,6,OP doesn't have the right to disagree with you about anything. The government has no duty to protect. The government does not.
15,7,The headline is misleading. It's just a joke about how this seems to be a problem with the government.

43,15,"In fact, it's actually just that the government is trying to give it a new meaning. They're giving people more reasons to keep getting the vaccines, and also increasing vaccinating rates. Unless you are a religious or conservative person that doesn't mind the news about a terrorist who is using it as a prank, then there's no point in keeping it a joke because they don't want to."

59,15,"As a kid, I'd have to wear a mask in public. That's my job."

65,15,>I feel like OP's title is misleading. I don't think there is any sort of issue here. It's more about what's being made available to society.
69,15,I'd probably go to the doctor and explain the idea that a mask could be used against people who wear them because they think they're being abused.
70,15,That's what I do.
74,15,"The only one I saw wearing a mask for was a dude who wore one when he sat in the office and he was saying ""hey the government is allowing dogs to come into this country, they want me to come and see my dog."""
76,15,The CDC hasn't shown this problem as an excuse. It explains why Vaccination isn't about prevention.
80,15,"i'm going to guess wearing a mask and it doesn't stop the spread of a virus, Vaccination is not a symptom of the virus. It is a virus that can cause people to feel more secure when they are in contact with the virus."
82,15,"""The first part of that quote was pretty bad. What if I were to go to the police and tell them they were going to be hacked in. Why is that joke so funny? Because if the police don't like it then they'll tell them. Is the government doing their job well?"","
89,15,"Is the word ""machete"" actually related to the sex or health problems causing this, or the lack thereof?"
91,15,I'm asking because I've always wondered this.
92,15,"If I remember correctly, I had a mask on for my birthday. I also had a vaccine for me, but I had been having an allergic reaction to it for a year. My friend had this nastier virus. I had this nastier virus and the vaccine was causing more infections. He could not even catch a tick and I got it every week. The doctor never told me to get it."

In the American context, I think that the fact that people have to wear a mask during the day can be helpful in keeping a person from getting a cold. It's because we don't eat and drink from our masks. I don't eat the food we use, but I do get the food we use in it."
61,16,I don't understand why people don't wear a mask. I don't understand why people have a bad habit of doing it.

16,10,I believe it's funny and just that it's part of the government's mission to stop the spread of the AIDS/AIDS virus.
21,16,A joke. Not a joke. A joke.
26,16,"It's so funny how people think if they were only at an event for fun, that the whole ""why do you want to be at an event?"" thing is a pretty good one."
27,16,I believe the joke is a slap to the face - unless it's AIDS.
35,16,"It's a prank, but no he doesn't have to be in the hospital to be in the hospital to be in the hospital to have it on. The CDC's goal is to prevent the spread of a virus. They have to have a prank on the medical staff, not on the government."
37,16,"Despite this joke, I don't think any of it is valid. There is something in here where a doctor is not doing anything to stop the spread of a virus. And then I hear that the mask is not a joke because the people that are infected are the ones that aren't infected."
41,16,"This is a joke. I don't think it's a joke, just that it's not a bad idea to put on a mask and that it is the best way to stop the spread of a virus. It's a joke, because it's not a joke, so it's not really a joke. It's just that it is a joke."
48,16,"This is a whole new level of ridiculous. This is just another layer of shit, and you can't even imagine a guy wearing a mask while you're still getting HIV."

93,17,"I'm a little jealous I've only ever seen people wearing a mask in the video game community. I've always felt like people were giving me a reason to wear it, and for the same reason, I am more worried about getting infected by things that's less terrifying."

101,17,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
17,9,"I'm going to rephrase that. I do like wearing my mask, but it's too uncomfortable for me to bear the fear that I'll get infected with a virus."
17,10,People wear a mask at work because they feel like it is more useful than a shirt :)
21,17,Then why is the government ignoring this as a means of stopping the spread of a virus?
35,17,"I like to wear a mask while I work in the military. My job was to give me medical advice, which I was not able to do in the field of. I just don't want to be a jerk about this."
40,17,The masks are worn for the purpose of stopping the spread of the virus.
47,17,"I like a lot of things in the media, but a lot of them are real. People don't care for the words ""sucks"" or ""dumbs"" and it seems like a lot of things are simply not meant as such."

40,17,"They don't say ""they are not wearing masks"" that's just the same as a mask."
47,17,"Yes, but if you are still a member of the government, he will not be able to legally wear a mask, as it may be a form of social security."
48,17,"I don't know if the answer is ""but you don't want to be vaccinated""? Is it, as it's usually called, ""Panthering at the Party"" in English?"
54,17,Wearing a mask to get away from the virus is part of the measures deployed by the government to stop it.

88,17,"Aside from being a cynical, I can say that the most hilarious and most interesting part of this whole thing is that it was an entire thread about a man who was so in love with a fat lip and wanted to be in a mask.

91,17,We're talking about the NSA.
93,17,"> Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. They also say that it's really hard to stop a virus if you don't wear a mask. So I guess that's kind of the end of the story, because I don't want to go in the first place."
100,17,I'm going to start off by saying that a python nerd isn't the only reason why people don't wear a mask and that it's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
101,17,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
17,9,I think you're in an awkward position. The only person I can believe is the government.

54,17,"It is a common issue in the United States to use a mask, in a similar fashion to the Vaccines for the Infectious Diseases (Mumps). The only exception to that is in the United States where an obstructive vaccination is compulsory (in my opinion) that can be effective to prevent people from getting mumps."
73,17,"The whole problem isn't in the government's best interest, but in the people who are."
76,17,Vaccination is about prevention.
81,17,I think the funny thing here is that this sort of situation is being addressed in the article.
84,17,"Y'know, you're gonna get out of here. The other guy who's said this is just going to shit on you for being a troll, that's really a bad thing if you're going to talk about 'the public school situation' and you don't get away with it. It's really hard to see how he feels and he's only laying there in a nutshell if he's in an area with a troll or something fucking up."

48,17,"In a similar vein, the joke: “I’m sorry that you’re having an issue with your mask. I’m sorry that you’re having an issue with your mask. That is the implication of the title.

That's the only way to stop a virus and also protects people, the other side is not. Wearing a mask prevents the spread of a virus.

93,17,:) I wear a mask on a run. It's a little hard to tell when my face isn't shattered by a virus. I don't know why but this is why I can't get it.

17,9,"The point isn't to prevent the spread of a virus, it's to prevent a virus from spreading, it's to prevent it from spread."
17,10,This is a joke. This is an asshole joke.
21,17,There's always a place for the truth... but that's just a joke!
35,17,I believe in the truth. The US can't even make a big deal about the fact that you should not be vaccinated unless you have a helmet. This is a joke and no joke. The CDC has been doing a ton of things in the past.
40,17,>A lot of people wear masks for their health to prevent infections that don't occur.
47,17,"If someone was going to say something like, ""Hey, that would be nice to have you with me."", the CDC and the CDC could have been better off."
48,17,I just want to give you the story of my life and my husband in all circumstances.
54,17,"This is what I think is important here. It’s a ridiculous idea that everyone should use when they have a bad time in an otherwise normal life, and when people aren’t at a good time they probably have better things to do because the NSA isn’t working on it."
73,17,"Its an act of kindness, but it's also a joke. Its an act of kindness, but it's also a joke. I don't really think that is an act of kindness."
76,17,I think it's a pretty good idea to be wearing a mask. I've noticed a noticeable difference between the two.
81,17,I feel the CDC is the one that is trying to prevent the spread of AIDS.
84,17,"""I don't care about his health. He’s not telling me about it. I think it’s funny that he’s been so insensitive."""
88,17,I'm not a doctor. You need to get the flu checked out.
91,17,You are making this very explicit. It is a twisted and twisted thing to say.
93,17,"Aside from that, you could also point to something called a ""ad hominem"" or a ""reality"", which basically includes the government inventing an ad hominem as a means to stop a virus from spreading."
100,17,"It's a good idea to wear a mask because people don't like it and they're not allergic to it. I'd also consider it a very bad idea, because wearing it in the middle of a day can make a person irritable and have a lot of discomfort and will lead to an increase in self-harm."

18,9,This is the part of my post that makes me hate this joke.
18,10,I think the point of that joke is that we're putting the government down by putting them on people to stop the spread of a virus.
18,13,What if I wear a mask for a race?
18,15,"A lot of people don't wear masks. If you can't see through the camera you have to do a very specific job, in most cases you're better off just walking and watching movies in a dark environment."

44,18,Are there any other ways to prevent a virus?

81,18,What's the issue with wearing a mask at work to protect others?
82,18,[NAME] flies into a building like this - you are not going to see the police - no you won't unless the cops show up and call the police to say no. If that's the case you can ask the cops to come on and have a look at the room and ask if they can look.
83,18,"> I'm sure this is a good one to make sure nobody is hurt. I’m so glad there’s one of these people who really needs a mask. I’ve had my first child wear a mask on a regular basis, but after several days it doesn’t seem to have a lasting effect."
89,18,"""We are not going to stop the spread of the virus in the morning"" is a bad analogy because the word you use in the first paragraph was taken from an article in an article about a very, very well known virus, which is actually a joke."
93,18,...I wear a mask all the time on a run. It's really important to know that you're not the only person who wants to put yourself at risk. What do you want to protect yourself from? How do you want to protect yourself from the virus? And do you want to make people care?

18,9,The funny thing is you're joking because you can't explain it without you knowing the difference between wearing a mask and not having it. If I were your friend I'd just tell you what's up.
18,10,I think a good way to look at this is to ask a question. Are you in a position where you need to be able to talk to people while you are on a run to get your head under control? I don't know.
18,13,"This joke is so long gone, it's not funny, its just not as funny."
18,15,"I can see where you're coming from, but my point is that you would have to be more specific and if you would've asked for a different mask, it's probably going to have to be a much better one, but it could be a good compromise, too."

60,20,This seems to me to be a pretty ambiguous post.
64,20,The American public has never been more willing to accept a mask. It isn't an acceptable way to do it.
65,20,This is just my personal opinion. What you are saying is exactly what I'm saying.
75,20,"It's a problem. If I had to change the mask, I would wear it at all times. I don't think that's a joke. I'm just letting people know my jokes and it really makes me feel like a failure."

84,20,"I would definitely tell her to wear a face mask, because it's a sign of a virus."

I see a lot of r/news articles that say a lot of the NSA propaganda is about ""walking masks "" and the NSA is talking about it. I do not see that a lot of people are blatantly stating they're the people who are making the propaganda."
97,20,The most important thing here is to take this information seriously. It isn't a logical thing to say but it is a good point.

60,20,"I read this as a person who could wear a mask if he didn't have a mask on. I thought he was saying people should wear a mask, to prevent the spread of a virus, so he said ""We should wear a mask"""
64,20,"It's a simple concept, but it's not that big of a deal. People wear masks to stop people getting sick. The problem isn't their health, it's not their ability to communicate what they know, so it's not a big deal."
65,20,[The government](http://www.mhsid.gov/) wears a mask to help prevent the spread of HIV (also known as a HIV clone) which is the symptom of HIV. That mask is the official anti-HIV mask that the government is distributing.
75,20,"It's the kind of joke a good doctor would think people who were going to have it will do and say to all a couple people if they didn't wear a mask, it's a prank that they are being silly about and it makes you feel bad for having it."

86,20,"You're right, we're just blatantly stating that you're the people who are making the propaganda."
97,20,You could wear a syringe while getting a lot of ticks. It's a bit more complicated than that.
20,2,Isn't a mask a form of a mask?
20,5,"Yes. And yes, the mask is needed for the vaccine, the vaccine must be worn in a position to prevent the spread of the virus."
23,20,"Vaccinations are very important and I believe there is a lot of scientific research on how to stop the spread of mumps. It is not a good idea, it's just a good idea. You get a little bit of fun out of that. You can wear a mask, but it does not prevent any disease."
32,20,The only way to prevent a virus outbreak is to help your husband.
34,20,"I'm afraid I'm being off-balance by being a prankster. I feel bad for the CDC, and for a lot of the other things that I know from the CDC."
42,20,> If a doctor decided to vaccinate a child they wouldn't have any problem with it.
60,20,"I don't think it's anything special to wear a mask while sick, just the way you say it."
64,20,"I mean, I'm not saying it is not a big deal. My point is, it's very important to not put it to people because of the stigma associated with it and in this case, because it doesn't imply anything to them, but rather how to tell people what is in a public forum. If a commenter is saying a question to me, then I don't know if I have the right to respond."
65,20,So there's this guy who likes to wear a mask in public but you think that the best way to prevent the spread of the virus is to wear a mask?
75,20,I'm getting some new questions every day.
84,20,And he’s using the word “event” for the whole thing.
86,20,"I've always felt like this is why people feel like they have to be afraid of being stung by a virus.... And then the NSA says, ""Waving a mask or helmet that will protect us from corona and that everyone would have to wear to go outside for a month or that would allow us to open up the economy again. I don't think the government is really doing any good. They're just telling the truth. I don't think the government is really doing any good. They're just telling the truth."
97,20,I'm not sure you understand the meaning of that. Is there a difference in the meaning of it?
20,2,A prankster? Not really a joke. A prankster??
20,5,It's a very important concept.
23,20,I was a child. I'm not sure how to express myself like that. I'm just trying to express my feelings about something I didn't know I was doing. I grew up with a really serious problem with. It's almost like I'm not very good at it.
32,20,"This is what I read. Whenever someone complains about a politician, the president should call them out on the video."
34,20,It's just a prank. People have no idea what it is.
42,20,"If you're going to try to avoid an outbreak, you should definitely seek advice from someone who tries to save you and you want to help."
60,20,Vaccination is the quickest and most effective cure for a virus. It works great when you're not in the flu.
64,20,... I can tell you the thing that has happened in my life - what if I wear a mask or a hat to get me sick?
65,20,"OP - [In order to prevent HIV, the government should be wearing a mask. It will prevent a virus from entering your home or from your home."""
75,20,"Well, there is one other thing I can say, that I think a good doctor would think people who are going to have it will do. I'm not sure, in my country, people will just use a mask. I feel like if you have a papilloma, I would go to a party with a mask on and don't have it. I know there is a CDC/disease-matter-failures-and-vaccinations.html site, it's a very real problem."
84,20,"I'm sure you will agree with everyone else here, but your wife will still have to wear a mask."
86,20,They could even make the NSA remove the airspace cloak from the public eye and rename it to the new one that supposedly prevents a mass spread of virus.
97,20,"I don't like a lot of sexist jokes. I don't like a lot of sexist jokes, but I would love to be a part of the virus."
20,2,I'm a little confused.
20,5,I'm afraid my health isn't good enough.
23,20,Vaccination is not a good idea.
32,20,[NAME] was the first person to actually mention it.
34,20,[NAME]: I don't know any more. I can't believe the CDC is using the same jokes to get more people sick. I think it's a joke.
42,20,"> Vaccinating a child is a big, serious mistake. I think the way to prevent it would be to put a mask on yourself because it would be a sign that you are exposing a child to a new form of HIV."
60,20,The medical community and the government are both trying to stop the spread of this virus. A virus is inherently dangerous and we can't prevent it.
64,20,"As a person who has never been more willing to accept a mask as a joke, I can tell you the fact that there's a huge difference between wearing a mask and trying to fuck someone who isn't going to be in a very long time. Hence my dislike of the word ""empathy mask""."
65,20,>Is the question about whether or not the government is supposed to be concerned about the safety of the population?
75,20,I'm an AIDS patient. I have my own Papilloma and I have an annual exam to find out if a friend has it. I think you are right that it is very common to have a papilloma.
84,20,The NSA can't force you to wear a mask when you get sick. There's an easy reason for it - that's a medical condition and the government isn't willing to take you for a virus test.
86,20,"I want to say, 'You know what they're saying, I can't help but feel like you're telling me what I know, I think it is just telling the truth'."
97,20,... because when you put a mask on it helps stop the spread of a virus. I'm going to guess wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. I'm going to guess wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

20,5,What's this? The joke?
23,20,"Yeah, 'I was a child with a very serious problem with. It's almost like I'm not very good at it. I grew up with a really serious problem with. I'm just trying to express my feelings. I'm just trying to express my feelings about something I didn't know I was doing."
32,20,He wasn't claiming the government was a problem. It was his prank.
34,20,I think the only joke I get out of this is that the CDC has some form of safety protocol where you can be seen by a mask. I like it because it's easy to get sick and the CDC knows everything about it.
42,20,">Making me wear a mask at work can make a person sick, but it does not prevent you from catching the virus."
60,20,"I'm not a doctor, I'm an advocate for using the word ""abuse"" to make fun of the government."
64,20,"You mean the NSA has done wrong things, but op is a troll?"
65,20,It sounds like the article is misleading and a bit about the government that needs to have an anti-vaccine campaign in order to have a prank on someone.
75,20,"""If I had to change the mask, I would wear it at all times. I don't think that's a joke."""
84,20,>They are trying to stop the spread of a virus and will extort money away from the people that actually need to buy it.'
86,20,"I know this is a bit strange, but the question I want to ask is whether there is any legitimate interest in this particular kind of thing, or if this could happen. What if I were a doctor and the NSA did anything to stop the spread of a virus, that would make me an agnostic for a year. Then there would be some unwarranted, unfounded and insincere accusations of conspiracy to prevent it. I think I could see it coming."
97,20,>I'm going to guess wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
20,2,>The medical community and the government are both trying to stop the spread of this virus. A virus is inherently dangerous and we can't prevent it.

23,20,I am sure he is a bit of a jerk because he can't be offended.
32,20,"Aye if you are a doctor and have a virus, you can still use a mask on your feet. Then it will also kill you if you are wearing it while driving."
34,20,You can't be a prankster and still get sick. We do not use masks. We need the money.
42,20,This is a lot like how the US 'proposed' to get the exemption.
60,20,"I would like to clarify. I think you mean this as ""I want to wear a mask""?"
64,20,"If that's what you mean, then it's not a joke."
65,20,"In short, it's not a joke, it's the prank that's gonna cause the people of Texas to think that they are stupid and that they can't wear them anymore."
75,20,I can tell you a lot about the papilloma joke.
84,20,"This is the first time someone in this thread has asked you to wear a mask, and you asked them to stop. That's a bit of a fucking lie."
86,20,People need to stop wearing a mask and talk about it for hours before going outside.

21,11,I just wanted to point out that that the first sentence is part of the post title.
21,12,"I know this is kind of sad, but the message from this article is that, while you can't keep yourself protected, you still have to wear a mask. The fact is that the virus isn't spread by the government, it's spread by someone else, and the government has decided not to enforce it in a way that makes them more tolerant of others."
21,16,"You just said: ""It's not hard to wear a mask on a run"""
21,17,They actually want people to have a safer environment because they are uncomfortable.

35,21,We're in an environment where people should be able to play sport without masks.

64,21,"Apparently this can be related to the 'inhibition of public use of a mask'movement, as well as the 'inhibition of government use of a mask'movement."
65,21,I hate that a virus can be easily spread without a mask. It can also be very uncomfortable. A virus will spread by itself if it is unknowingly spread through others.

21,12,"So, I'm in no way advocating this."
21,16,I would want to know how to wear a mask.
21,17,Then why is the government ignoring this as a means of stopping the spread of a virus?
34,21,Isn't wearing a mask part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus? Because no.
35,21,They aren't allowed to do it.
52,21,"Wearing a mask outside is a great idea, but vaccinating someone in their face to help in the fight against HIV in the US doesn't sound like much of a better idea."
64,21,"Isn't that what the government wants people to wear, when they do something to prevent the spread of a virus?"
65,21,"I'm not saying you can't get a job that's nice and comfortable, but it sounds like you know a lot about the virus, so maybe you should look at the definition of comfort as well."
68,21,"Its like a CDC thing. I would not wear a mask in public unless i were in a private space with people on my phone, because they may see a face mask. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
73,21,"I would wear a mask with the venom in it while vaccinating a child, but the government will not make his entire team aware of the effect. The first person person person, who is being an asshole, can never put a mask on."
75,21,"I went to the party with a mask containing the people who wouldn't wear them. They didn't care what was going on. They knew that what was going to happen would happen if they didn't get their bodies to a certain level. They also said that they'd do everything possible to prevent a pandemic. In my experience a mask, and a mask, is one thing."
83,21,Is there something to be said for a person who is in a serious state and needs a medical professional to take over or is there a government mandate for people to wear a mask?
84,21,> he was late but i gotta hand it to he s got me wearing my mask everywhere and my area is Well I can help with the mask. Have a good day.
87,21,"I think it's fair to say that it has something to do with the fact that if it isn't a good idea to get vaccinated and do it in public, it can be helpful in preventing the spread of other diseases. Vaccines are good for both a person and a society. Vaccines are better than not getting vaccinated."
21,11,"> Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.Go for it, then come on and let me know how it goes. I'll be at the public park. A neo nazism will not be as successful in stopping a pandemic, they just want to make sure their bodies stay strong enough to survive."
21,12,"So a big fat fat man just wanted to tell a guy he did not want to be the president of the world, and that he could be the head of a federal agency. The government will never enact a law that is a bit too'sexist' to be an effective one."
21,16,"It's also part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.Go for it, then come on and let me know how it goes."
21,17,"It's because the government believes that public health is important in keeping a people at risk in a safe environment. But, no. I've been here. I was just going to say the same thing if you were me I would want to know how to wear a mask. Have a good day."
34,21,You should be wearing a mask and using the same slack that the CDC is using to stop the spread of a virus.
35,21,I'm not a nurse. But this isn't a solution to a problem. I am talking about something more important to me than a virus. The thing I want to do is to look out for you.
52,21,It sounds like you're gonna be a bit of a dick here. The government is gonna do something about it.
64,21,I've been a part of a campaign where people get the impression that the 'government' is the only viable solution to prevent people from getting sick.
65,21,"Well, there is a huge difference between ""not wearing a mask to protect yourself from HIV, but ""wearing a mask and survive than contract the virus."""
68,21,This guy is a patriot. He deserves to be seen with a face mask.
73,21,"I would be wearing a mask in public but the government will not make his entire team aware of the effect. The first person person person person person, who is being an asshole, can never put a mask on. I see what you mean, but how do you think he is being condescending and dick-faced person. It sounds like you have a lot to hide."
75,21,I think the first thing we want to do is be more proactive about the anti-vaccination movement.
83,21,I don't know about the government but that's something you can get by just watching TV.
84,21,It's a good thing that we have such a bad system of communication and a bad public image. The issue is with the perception of the mask.
87,21,"Well, you're not a doctor, but a doctor with a viral infection that is not a known problem. It's not that you should vaccinate someone. There are some reasons why people will do that, but this isn't really an issue that you should be vaccinating. It's not a problem in the least, it's a problem for everyone."
21,11,The NSA and the government are both the only ones that can do anything about the infection and you don't have to have any vaccines.
21,12,"> I would wear a mask with the venom in it while vaccinating a child, but the government will not make his entire team aware of the effect."
21,16,"I'm a nurse and I have had my fair share of problems with a virus in the past, which is why I think it is a good idea to wear a mask when i get sick."
21,17,"I don't think this is a good idea to say, but I do think that if a public health professional was entrusted with that job and would be able to help, they would be better off using that job instead."
34,21,That is exactly what the article was supposed to say.
35,21,I'd say it's part of what they do to prevent the spread of a virus.
52,21,I've been doing it since I was about 9 and my eyes were red and I'm going to feel like that's all. That's all. It sounds like you're gonna be a bit of a dick here. The government is gonna do something about it. I think we're on the same page here.
64,21,I really love you. Have a good day!
65,21,"I'm not sure what that means in any way, but there's a difference between not wearing a mask and being a part of the government. There's nothing inherently wrong with that. It's just that some people tend to put on a mask just because of the 'right' of being a part of the government. They want it to stop the spread of a virus, even if they feel comfortable."
68,21,"Unless you want to be a patriot and it sounds like they are, then it's not a patriot."
73,21,What did the article say? How many people is there to know that he's a dickhead?
75,21,They say it's not a joke. You are just a stupid kid and don't know what you are talking about.
83,21,"I was able to go into the ER today and it looked like my asthma was going to go away. It was so bad, but not as bad."
84,21,The truth about wearing a mask is about a lack of awareness and an increase in the number of people wearing it. That's what has been discussed a lot here.
87,21,"As a doctor, I'm not vaccinated."
21,11,It's about a lack of awareness and an increase in the number of people who do it.
21,12,You think that he is going to be a dickhead? He sounds like a weirdo.
21,16,"I'm not a doctor. I'm a nurse. I think it is a good idea to wear a mask, especially if you don't have any experience with it."
21,17,What if I said that the doctor was a dickhead?
34,21,> We need a better solution to a disease like papilloma.
35,21,It was a bit inflammatory. It was the kind of joke that made me think of all the government programs that were started by the president a few years ago.
52,21,"So the ""intentional anti-roosefooting"" thing is still an issue to debate but still the same? Unless you're really a virus user, then you're a virus."
64,21,"> Apparently this can be related to the 'inhibition of public use of a mask'movement, as well as the 'inhibition of government use of a mask'movement."
65,21,"> if I wear a mask and it is about stopping the spread of the virus, then it isn't so bad. You can wear whatever it is that makes you feel good about myself, you don't need to wear the mask."
68,21,He's just a patriot and I don't think he can be in a position to become a patriot.
73,21,"This is the one where I think that the government is inefficient. If the government isn't doing anything to stop the spread of AIDS, then I think it is an exaggeration."
75,21,I'm a doctor and wear a mask. I am a doctor.
83,21,"You're going to have to look pretty damn good with your doctor's help to figure out how to use a mask. Getting a mask is a good idea, but you don't necessarily want to wear it, if it's a non-emergency plan."
84,21,It's also a sign of an unsanitary public environment.
87,21,You haven't said anything good about wearing a mask.
21,11,I was a doctor and always tried to wear a mask because I wanted to see what I could see. Then when I tried to get vaccinated they went back to the doctor to explain. So I said that to the doctor and then asked him for a prescription to get vaccinated. I also said that I tried to get a prescription on my own when I had already started and was told that it was because I didn't think about a prescription. They said they were essentially saying I had an asthma attack.
21,12,"''The truth about wearing a mask is about a lack of awareness and an increase in the number of people who do it. The truth about wearing a mask is about a lack of awareness and an increase in the number of people who do it.""''"
21,16,">I think it is a good idea to wear a mask, especially if you don't have any experience with it."
21,17,"As a child, I felt this way about getting a doctor to help me. The doctors are the only people in the community to do their part."
34,21,"There are a lot of pranks that are in the CDC, they do not use them, and there are people who do."
35,21,I think this is what a lot of people are saying.
52,21,"I am not sure who is trying to use the word ""trick"" with the NSA. I would just call it ""trick""."
64,21,> I am a little sad that I was the first person to be able to get vaccinated by wearing a mask.
65,21,"I read this as, a joke Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.My husband would do it with me and be wearing a mask. I would wear a mask in the hospital. I'm a medical professional. I think the best way to prevent people from getting virus from your home is to wear a mask at all times. I think it is nice that they are doing what the government is doing and say they are not working, but not that they are doing it anyway."
68,21,"People that are crazy can be crazy if they wear masks. They can just look at someone as strange, but it sounds like a very simple thing to do to a crazy person."
73,21,"I didn't mean to insult or deny that they're working to stop AIDS. I meant to say that it's a problem, but not a joke."
75,21,"I don't think there is a big problem with wearing a mask, or not knowing what a papilloma is."
83,21,I'm a very large physician and have been wearing a mask for many years. I also don't believe that medical aid is really a viable option in the long run. Is there a difference between a mask and a vaccine?
84,21,"The way people are treating people is a bit confusing, huh? The fact that you guys are still working at the government and you're also wearing masks is a little shady, because if you're in a hurry they can't see you. There are some serious shady people who are willing to give someone a mask just to keep them away."
87,21,"I'm not saying that I have a right to vaccinat people. But I think I have a right to do so. I think I've said something good about doing so, but I don't think it would be right for everyone to think that I should go outside and get vaccinated unless they're sick. I would do so in public because I would not mind that, because they don't have authority on the vaccine and I don't think I'm in the minority."
21,11,"> ""The truth about wearing a mask is about a lack of awareness and an increase in the number of people who do it."""
21,12,"I mean, I feel like you might have been going from being a doctor to being a medical professional to trying to force the people to give a shit about it."

21,17,"Yes! And the best way to prevent the spread of the virus from being in your house is to take a mask on yourself. That's one way you can stop the spread of AIDS, and that's another way you can get some of the most expensive drugs available."
34,21,"This is a lot like the CDC's memo that says, ""We need a vaccine to stop the spread of viruses."" It says, ""We need a vaccine to stop the spread of viruses."" But there is nothing to the joke that says ""Pah-ph-ah-ph-h-ph-ph-md."
35,21,""" I'd say it's part of what they do to prevent the spread of a virus. It's not just about the mask, it's about how people in the military and private sector can feign the need to knowingly become people who don't have a mask.

64,21,"I like the wording. If it was a joke, then I'd be ok with wearing a mask."
65,21,"I'm a doctor and I wear a mask to protect myself from HIV. I've never seen anyone that wears them in public. I feel that wearing a mask is good for them. I don't think it's a good idea. I'm not sure what the term ""a mask"" is for, but that's just a phrase."
68,21,"The mask thing is funny because they've called it ""a retort"" and you didn't think about it."
73,21,"Apparently, the CDC has been doing the same thing with the HIV and THC treatment."
75,21,I don't know what a prank is. And I'm not a doctor.
83,21,So you want to protect yourself from getting sick?
84,21,I don't even know why the first paragraph is downvoted. I really need to read that. And you know what?
87,21,There is not a difference between wearing a mask and an AIDS virus.
21,11,CANNOTANSWER : The CDC and the NSA are both the only ones that can do anything about the infection and you don't have to have any vaccines.

21,17,"What a joke. I was told to tell my husband to ""buy a mask""."
34,21,I like how they're going to make this a lot of jokes because it's like they have been using a mask for so long that they will never get a response.
35,21,"It's really weird. I think people don't understand why people don't want to wear a mask. It's really weird, it is a joke."
52,21,There's a thing called a mask to combat infection.
64,21,> The only thing I know is that I'm a man and the people I know are in the middle of a conversation about it. What are you talking about?
65,21,That's not how a prank works.
68,21,It's a political thing and is not a government thing.
73,21,"I'm not an advocate of AIDS, but a liar. If I were you, I'd give the CDC a visit. But I'm not a dickhead, I'm a veb."
75,21,"Those are good terms to use here, but you can't be sure. They're not a joke."
83,21,I've read several t-shirts and I just wanted to say you're right.
84,21,">You guys are not a lawyer, and you guys are not a lawyer."
87,21,The government is working to save the world.
21,11,Why would someone buy a mask if they already had a mask?
21,12,">I am not an advocate of AIDS, but a liar."
21,16,"I know some people who aren't going to be as close to an AIDS patient as I am. My husband does the same thing, but without a mask, and I don't know what he's talking about."

35,21,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry I'm just in that room. I really am not. I have a problem, I can't answer the phone in the morning."
52,21,What you see here is the part where people wear a mask in the face of a virus they are trying to protect themselves.
64,21,"That's like saying, ""I like the wording. If it was a joke, then I'd be ok with wearing a mask."""
65,21,"It's a joke if you are a doctor. I don't know why anyone would say this, but it's a joke."
68,21,"It has been around for a long time, and I can't stand it if we continue to see it being worn by people. It's not my opinion that we should wear a mask in every emergency or that we should prevent it from spreading."
73,21,Isn't it really a joke about that? I'm not sure what the fuck this guy is saying because he just isn't making it up.
75,21,I think you're overly critical of CDC.
83,21,I'm not a doctor but I am a huge medical professional who has a lot of experience with the treatment of infectious disease. It is possible for anyone that is in an emergency to do what is necessary to save them.
84,21,"The most annoying part of the joke is that people on reddit are still not allowed to wear masks, which is probably a big enough issue to make this sub sub feel like it's a joke."
87,21,"This is a very good point, and it's a pretty good one."
21,11,It's not a joke because the CDC and NSA are both at fault here.
21,12,That is a joke. It is about a lack of awareness and an increase in the number of people who do it. It is not a joke.
21,16,A joke. Not a joke. A joke.
21,17,There's always a place for the truth... but that's just a joke!
34,21,I know a lot of people who wear masks but they don't want to get into the hands of the people they want to prevent a pandemic.
35,21,Vaccinations are not the only way to stop the spread of a virus.
52,21,It's not a joke. It's a fact. It's a fact.
64,21,I don't know what to write about this but I'm really curious what they think the purpose of masks is in general.
65,21,I believe the problem isn't that people aren't aware how HIV is spread and people that don't know about it.
68,21,"... and I also have some opinions of what it means to wear a mask, so I think it's nice that you don't wear a mask"

64,22,"I've seen several posts about how people wear masks while working a sick job. They are called 'empathy masks' because of the way they'save' themselves. And if they're only in use a few days, that's why they are called 'empathy masks'."
83,22,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.So, if you have a fecal disease, is it possible to wear a mask on an unprotected child? Then you can be covered in a fecal infection that will be in your head for a few days. It was so bad, but not as bad. Is the public's right to decide what to do? Is it the best thing I could have done?"
85,22,"> Because I don't feel like my vebb would be in a place of comfort or safety. If I wear a mask on my birthday, I want my husband to be around, he's not my dog and I want to avoid getting sick of him in case he has a vebbb and I have problems."
87,22,"I don't think this is in any context. The point is that you should have thought that if you get sick, you'll get sick. The problem with vaccination is not that people shouldn't put their face on a mask, but that it is a way to prevent infection."
90,22,"he said he wanted to wear a mask because it was a way to hide his fear. but now that he has no idea where he is, it seems like it would be better for him to put the mask on with the e-mail that he's given out and then go with it."
91,22,This is really a great discussion.
100,22,"The fact that a man who has worn a mask and hasn't seen the mask in his daily life does not mean that he is 'cool'. There's only an issue with the perception of the people he sees in his own head, and it's not like the people who haven't seen the mask are just 'cool' because they think they are cool."
22,13,"That's just the most important part of the vaccine, but it's very simple. A mask helps fight the spread of the disease."

52,22,"I'm afraid the word ""maske"" is pretty broad to be honest, but I'm willing to bet you that someone with HIV and a mask or an AIDS virus will not be at risk. And that's not to say the government isn't a dick."
61,22,"Is this the kind of thing where people who don't know what an HIV infection is will be offended? I don't see what a guy can't help, so I don't feel good about it."
64,22,The wording has been inconsistently misleading. It's the opposite of the phrase.

90,22,"I don't think it's a joke, it's just a bit crazy, I think the first part of this video is a complete one. I just think this is kind of funny. I do not think it's funny. The joke I think is funny is that people can be offended by that prank or they think it's a good idea. It's a prank, it's a prank, it's just that this is a prank that most people would be offended by."
91,22,The first line is the worst part. It is not about how government and private entities create and protect their own people.
100,22,"This is an apt title because the main point in this thread was that we are using ""Savage"" as a name for people who wear a mask. But since we are using ""savage"" as a term for people who are wearing a mask and don't have the knowledge to make a choice, that is not the point here. So instead, I'm saying that people who wear a mask and then put on a mask are actually people who have not yet seen the mask in their daily lives."
22,13,That's one of the reasons that he has to stop wearing it. He has to stop being in a fight with people who would like to get out of it. He is an idiot and I can't stand him in this.
26,22,"My dad had to put a mask on when I was a kid, and my mom and dad did the same thing. I never went out in public with my mom because of it, and I just thought she was pretty good. My father is a great actor. I like the fact that he's a troll."
31,22,The first part of the quote in the post is the omission of the quote. I'm pretty sure they are just going to give him a life jacket.
52,22,I wear a mask and bend my head out.
61,22,"I don't know why people are joking, but I think that the first sentence is ""I don't think it's a joke, I think it's the NSA's job to protect us from infection and he's wearing a mask."""
64,22,This is the exact type of mask that makes the virus go away?
83,22,It's a part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
85,22,You are being a man of your word. You need to be honest with your husband.
87,22,"I'm a doctor. I'm a nurse. I am a dr and it seems like I'm getting sick all the time. I'm also vaccinated against a virus and we have been vaccinated to prevent it from spreading. This is a joke and it's not a joke. It's a joke. This joke is all a joke. But, he is a troll."
90,22,I think if they said a prank on a prank and then started trying to use a different name to make the rehash of the word route that might be a joke then it's a joke.
91,22,"''The problem here is the government. It does not want to make the same threats over and over, it wants to make them think that it's a symptom of a more serious problem, but it doesn't want to be the problem at all."

83,22,"The article says that ""Women who want to protect themselves from getting sick have every right to a free mask, but the public has the right to decide what they want to do."", """
85,22,There's a reason why most people hate the NSA. It doesn't make them feel a certain way.
87,22,"Vaccines are still a huge issue with most doctors, but they're not mandated."
90,22,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
91,22,Is this really something you're looking for? What else are you talking about?
100,22,"I feel like this is the next episode of the ""What are we really talking about?"" series of movies."
22,13,"Vaccines are still a huge issue with most doctors, but they're not mandated. Wearing a mask while being vaccinated is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
26,22,"I don't think we're seeing a big problem here. Vaccination does not work, but it isn't a prank."
31,22,"This is a really great post, but I think there is some really useful information here. One thing that comes to mind is that a virus is not really a virus. Vaccination is used as a form of protection against most of those. There is also a big reason why people are so critical to peoples health and safety in many countries."
52,22,"The joke is, ""I'm gonna say, I don't like this. I know a lot of people who think wearing a mask is a great idea, but in my opinion I don't think the NSA understands the issue. I've gotta be honest."
61,22,"> I think the real problem with wearing a mask is that it doesn't really address the issue that is spreading. I think it is more that people want to be protected from infection. I think it is more that people want to be protected from a virus."""
64,22,I'm sure the NSA isn't doing it's job. There's no reason they should stop the fucking.
83,22,People who want to wear a mask can wear one without a mask because they feel uncomfortable. Is that what you are saying a tv show you aren't going to be interested in?
85,22,"> ""Wearing a mask doesn't help stop the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask doesn't help stopping the spread of a virus.idk how the NSA works or what it does not do, but in addition it makes your life much harder and the government will continue to work on a lot of different things."""
87,22,You're right. This is a troll.
90,22,What's it that makes you want to run a prank?
91,22,"I've been exposed to the spread of AIDS, I am not even sure where I can live without wearing a mask. I think I should make sure I'm safe, though."
100,22,"I believe ""if you get sick you will be infected."""
22,13,The point of this article is to suggest that people aren't necessarily immune to any form of health risks. The article is not about that.
26,22,"I would love for people who wear a mask to know what's up, but not a good prank or a good joke."
31,22,"I'm just trying to get a little more clear - there is a bit of an 'I'm really mad at this prank.' I'm not even sure why people are putting off this joke, I just want a bit more information, I don't think I'd make a joke about this, because I've learned to talk with my parents and their parents about it."
52,22,The part where people wear a mask in the face of a virus they are trying to protect themselves.
61,22,The NSA has been known to use the CDC as a propaganda tool to protect children from HIV. It's no wonder people are so terrified of the CDC.
64,22,"My bf wore a mask when he was sick. He went to work when he was sick. He came home in the middle of the night because he had a fever, but when he did he had a nosebleed.

And then he was in the hospital in the middle of the night and he got his nose sucked in a big blowjob. He actually has a nosebleed, but he tries to"
83,22,The federal government is a giant piece of shit.

23,20,"Vaccinations are very important and I believe there is a lot of scientific research on how to stop the spread of mumps. It is not a good idea, it's just a good idea. You get a little bit of fun out of that. You can wear a mask, but it does not prevent any disease."
30,23,A lot of people think that wearing a mask on a run is a big threat.
32,23,Why should I be wearing a mask at all? Do I have to wear a mask at all times when I work?
34,23,"So I... have a bunch of people like this talking about the government making a mask to fight off the spread of viruses, right?"
54,23,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

75,23,"RIP a papilloma guy. What's this? The CDC is trying to control what they say, a prank."
82,23,What about it being a joke? Because if the police don't like it then they'll tell them.
87,23,You're talking about this ad. It's ridiculously silly that people on this list are doing something that's not relevant. This is about a virus. It's not about an immunity problem or being sick if it's a virus.
91,23,The quote from the article is actually actually a part of how the government is using the NSA's surveillance method.
92,23,"I'm sorry. I can't understand why you're being dramatic. I'm really sorry, and I'm sorry I can't even comprehend that I have an answer to that question."
99,23,A couple of the things I did as a child were:
23,2,Why does the CIA use the NSA's surveillance method? They are using the NSA and not the government.
23,6,That is actually actually a part of how the NSA is using the NSA's surveillance method.
23,19,Vaccinations are part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.What if I were to go to the police and tell them they were going to be hacked in. Why is that joke so funny?
23,20,I was a child. I'm not sure how to express myself like that. I'm just trying to express my feelings about something I didn't know I was doing. I grew up with a really serious problem with. It's almost like I'm not very good at it.

82,23,That's not a good joke. I read it a lot and you're right.

The CDC is focusing on helping prevent the spread of the virus."

23,20,I am sure he is a bit of a jerk because he can't be offended.
30,23,The CDC isn't going to stop the spread of HIV unless they want to.
32,23,"Is there any way I can make a cynical, racist, or narcissist joke about something that isn't a joke?"
34,23,The CDC is making a joke. They are putting this joke in this thread because they think people are using it as a way to stop the spread of a virus.

41,24,I'm so tired of people doing that. People relying on the government's protection is so much better. They don't actually have to wear a mask to keep the virus away. That's why they are there for a reason.

25,24,"Vaccination is not a right and a responsibility, it is a duty of the person who is vaccinated."
34,24,"""We are looking forward to an update with the CDC about the effectiveness of this legislation."""
41,24,Vaccination is a good and effective tool for stopping the spread of the virus.
42,24,"Vaccinating a child is a big, serious mistake. I think the way to prevent it would be to put a mask on yourself because it would be a sign that you are exposing a child to a new form of HIV. I would say go for it. It's probably not worth the risk."
46,24,"This isn't going to work out for everyone. But it's a good idea to make it more public, and we need to use it to make it more useful in the world."
62,24,"The government is doing more to stop the spread of a virus. The virus can be spread through the NSA. I suspect people don't like to wear a mask, but don't have a vebb. It's part of the government's mandate to do so."

80,24,> I'm going to guess wearing a mask and it doesn't stop the spread of a virus. It seems like the government isn't really doing its job. There's no reason they shouldn't stop the fucking. The first part of the quote was pretty bad. Then it sounded like a joke.
83,24,"A lot of people in that sub are getting away with things like wearing the CDC-funded scleroderma vaccine, but are not getting away with it since it is the only way to deal with the infection."

41,24,"I don't know what you're talking about. The government has a right to say any time, even when it makes no effort to stop a virus from spreading. They don't actually have to wear a mask to keep a virus away. They're there for a reason. You're a threat to the security of the community. There is a subreddit for anti trolls who would do the same thing."
42,24,I'm in Florida right now and I don't know what to do with that mask.
46,24,I'm still amazed at the amount of people in that thread who thought that putting a mask on in the middle of a night is a pretty common thing.
62,24,"[See: The US government's mandate to stop the spread of a virus]. Its part of the government's mandate to do so. I suspect people don't like to wear a mask, but don't have a vebb."
65,24,"It's the other way around, the person who wrote the article was actually actually joking. It was not to be taken as a prank, but rather an attempt to hush the message of it. Basically, it was simply a way for the government to work together and not go around bringing up the issue."
66,24,"I would like to say that the whole ""Bird's Day"" thing is a good one."
70,24,"My mom got me a mask and I was trying to figure out why she liked it despite it being a big deal. She got me a very expensive mask, but that was too much for me. I said it's a good idea for the kids, they would go into it, they could have a great time with me. The people that don't like it don't like it, and they also don't want to look silly or have sex with me, so I think I would be very uncomfortable with the idea of it."
73,24,"What's he trying to do about it? Tell him, the fact that you're a dick and you haven't been vaccinated has to do with that."

25,24,The CDC cites the CDC to be the only medical tool to promote vaccine use. They will be implementing it in many places if they get a chance.
34,24,I like how the CDC is using the same jokes to get more people sick. I think it's a joke.
41,24,This is a joke. There is no such thing as a bad joke.
42,24,"I'm from Florida. I have a coma and we need to talk about this very important topic, preventing the spread of the virus and preventing the spread of the virus. It is important to know that the people who are asking for the exemption should be able to protect themselves and the public from the spread."
46,24,So you said you are getting sick? This isn't true. Unless you're in a job with the CDC. You are in a job with the government. What I'm talking about is being sick and you are being sick.
62,24,"I'm not sure why people like wearing a mask. I'm just curious. How 'likely' that will be interpreted if you don't wear a mask on a plane, or if that's just a 'likely' way to stop the spread of a virus?"

They can make it a ""must be vaccinated"" policy. They can make it a ""must be vaccinated"" policy, but that's not the policy here."
73,24,Why is wearing a mask part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of AIDS?
78,24,Wearing a mask in public is the same as putting a mask on. There is no need to wear it to prevent people from experiencing a disease or being infected.
80,24,The first part of the quote was pretty bad. Then it sounded like a joke.
83,24,"I don't really understand the context of the statement in question. Basically, you're right that a doctor can prescribe the scleroderma vaccine for free as long as he's willing to pay for it, so that you have the right to be able to get the scleroderma vaccination. But it seems like the law of the land is not quite as clear as we think."
90,24,"We've made fun of these in the past, but here's a secret:"

34,24,"I think I'm going to have to give the CDC a call, but I would have to give it to you if I thought it was a joke."
41,24,That’s a terrible thing.
42,24,I have a friend who uses the hat as a mask for work. So I think they should probably stop wearing it.
46,24,I don't think you can take a joke from this subreddit.
62,24,This guy is a dick.
65,24,"In the case of this article, I'm pretty sure that it is a prank."
66,24,"The CDC is not in charge of preventing the spread of the virus, and the CDC should not be involved in the vaccination of people with AIDS."

73,24,">I think it's a joke about how the government is inefficient, but the thing is not what's preventing AIDS."
78,24,It's a prank. It's not an idiotic idea. It's a prank.
80,24,"It's not a joke, it's a joke."
83,24,I have been given a mask to go out for a long time because I wanted to protect myself.
90,24,"This is about people trying to get to know each other with the word ""prank."" It's the whole point of a prank. What's the whole point of a prank. What's the whole point of a prank.

45,25,"I've got a hand lubricated one and I have to wear it after I am done vaccinating people in public. It's a great thing, but a hand lubricated one is not going to protect other people."
47,25,I think this is in the context of people getting sick of being outed for being outside of their jobs. I think it's a bit different now. But maybe some people need a little help getting better.

99,25,It seems like a very good thing for humans to not wear masks in a day. If I was on this planet I would not be able to enjoy the holiday without one of these masks.
101,25,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
25,24,I think the CDC would be willing to put you in the same situation.
45,25,"You do not have the right to wear a mask outside on Thanksgiving if you don't want to. You can wear a hand lubricated one outdoors while vaccinating a person outside and a mask in a crate. You can wear a hand lubricated one in public as well, but it doesn't have to protect other people when they do a mask."

56,25,"Vaccination isn't the only vaccine available, it's a bad idea."
64,25,I'm going to go to a doctor if I ever have to wear a mask. That way they don't actually get sick.
67,25,What do you mean by a joke? Apparently the guy who said it was a joke didn't mean to. Unless they wanted to go to the school and they said the guy did. And they got the CDC to do it anyway.
85,25,This is why I'm so stoked for the guy that is still working for the government and is resentful about it.
91,25,"You're only in the beginning of it, not the middle of it. I'm a big fan of the NSA's use of it."

I'm sorry if I sounded too harsh but this is a great one. Hopefully, people don't have to go through with the vaccines on Thanksgiving and get over the fact that their doctors are using vaccines to stop the spread of the virus."
47,25,>I've never read a single piece of written literature where people can't be bothered to wear a mask. There is a government funded program that would stop people from wearing a mask.
56,25,It doesn't address the issue that's spreading. It's a huge question.

47,25,I don't understand why people are being offended by the idea that people are being offended by wearing masks. I do believe that putting on a mask would be a huge help to prevent the spread of a virus.
56,25,"There are lots of good ways to stop people getting sick, but not the whole ""it's a good idea,"" thing."
64,25,I think it's funny that the one person who wears a mask is a black woman.

85,25,"I wouldn't be happy without a mask. That's a bad idea, though."

99,25,I think that you should see a doctor who wears a mask for Christmas as a means of stopping the spread of the virus.
101,25,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
25,24,I think it's not as bad as what we think is happening in the CIA or the NSA.

67,25,"It's not a joke, I mean he made a joke about wearing a mask in a bad way. He didn't say anything to me and it's funny and I just don't like the idea of him making a joke. It's a joke, not a joke."

45,25,"No, it's not. A mask does protect other people and is not a good idea. It can be done anywhere, for no reason at all, and at any time, and can't stop a viral disease."
47,25,Well it would have to be a very short article.
56,25,>We should definitely wear one on my plane. It's a joke.

25,24,It's not really a joke. It's a joke.
45,25,"Vaccination is a good idea, but it also provides protection for sick people who are not in a danger zone. This is also why it's not a joke."
47,25,I don't think you are offended. The CDC is doing nothing to keep people from getting sick.

37,26,"I had this question before, how does it work? How is it the government that mandates the masks?"
38,26,"As an ex-moldie, I can say it would be one of the most horrible things I have ever read in my life."
44,26,I just found the link on r/politics and now I'm going to leave my mask on. My only comment is about how the government is trying to evict people in a way that seems to be very helpful to me.
45,26,It's funny because there is a difference between a man wearing a mask and a man wearing a mask. I feel like you're referring to people who are wearing the same type of mask as me.
55,26,I'm gonna go ahead and say I was a lot better in the US vaccinating my kids a few months ago than the people who were going to a party with an entire house full of vaccinated people. My dad always wears a mask that I know he's had to wear and bend over.
57,26,> Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. It is a huge problem for the world to recognize it has a lot to do with the amount of people who don't wear a mask.
64,26,They're not really referencing the same thing. There is no need for you to wear a mask. It's a necessity.
67,26,That was a very good example of wearing a mask. It didn't help me.
75,26,"I can't get myself to wear a mask. So I just can't. It's kind of annoying, and I'm going to end up getting a cold and that makes me sick."
26,16,'I like wearing a mask because i can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows'
26,22,I have no idea what you mean by that.
31,26,"This is a good question. The question you asked, ""I don't wear a mask because I'm afraid I can't do it because I think it's a bad idea, but I like wearing a mask so I can get vaccinated and be more comfortable""."
35,26,The government can't use a mask to stop a virus from spreading. It needs to stop a virus from spreading through the government.

45,26,You're not wrong about that. I think that's a good way to think of it.
55,26,It's just an excuse for the people in the party whose masks a couple of months ago were not removed.
57,26,Is there a subreddit where you could link it to the article where they say 'Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus'?
64,26,What is the difference between wearing a mask and going out and having a baby?
67,26,"My mother always wore a mask in a fight and said ""No"". She hasn't gotten one in a while, but I think she was doing the right thing by saying something along the lines of ""Well you can still have a good laugh when you're in a fight with your family."" I think she has a bad idea with the MRSA shit. I know what I mean and I think that is a good thing, but there is just something in here where you feel really bad for the people who wear a mask."
75,26,"The issue is that in Germany, there's a mask to prevent the spread of a viral infection."
26,16,You could go to r/politics and post a link to the article where they say that:
26,22,Is a good question a good question?
31,26,"It's the government's business. But you've been out of the country, and you don't have a job that is more important than theirs. You can't wear a mask to protect yourself, or if you do, you can't wear a mask."
35,26,A couple of places I've been to saying the same thing.
37,26,You're not a lawyer. It's a law. You're not an anti-virus advocate.
38,26,He is an idiot. I'm not sure if he should wear a mask or if it's not his. He should be using the same type of mask.
44,26,I just noticed that you have two ideas : I'm a good person.
45,26,You said the same thing in your original post.
55,26,">I'm gonna go ahead and say I was a lot better in the US vaccinating my kids a few months ago than the people who were going to a party with an entire house full of vaccinated people. My dad always wears a mask that I know he's had to wear and bend over."","
57,26,I am not sure how this is even possible. If the government wants to stop the spread of a virus the government will. The CDC needs to see a different perspective about what's happening. The people in the world do not care about those people but the government does. It is not a big problem if people don't wear masks.
64,26,This is a very good way to say the word.
67,26,I think we should have a discussion about this topic if the people who use masks aren't willing to spend money on them.
75,26,"I have a friend who has a case of pandemic virus, and he wears a mask for the day. he wants to wear it in case he needs to come out and have an interesting conversation about it. I'm a doctor so I'm ok with this."
26,16,"If people don't know to wear a mask, the government can't stop a pandemic."
26,22,A good question is a good question. Does it make a good question or is it good if the answer is yes?
31,26,"I know it is a sexist comment, but I wouldn't say it's funny. I don't like being told about something that isn't the norm and not the government's business, but rather to say I don't wear a mask at all, since I'm actually pretty fucking unfriendly to it. It's not a joke, but it's just a way to be polite, I don't think it's funny."
35,26,"A few of those times I've never seen one of those before and it made my day. It's like ""hey, they're getting better and better! Now the kids can stop that virus from spreading! You'll be the next one. You'll be the next one."""
37,26,This is the same'mandate' that Obama used in his presidential campaign. That's when he decided to go to the government instead of the doctors. That's when the NIH would do their own thing to block everyone who wears masks.
38,26,Is this the first thing that's been mentioned in this sub?
44,26,"It doesn't seem like the government has a right to make people wear a mask, but that's what it is."
45,26,"So, if you don't like a virus, you should not have to wear a mask outside on Thanksgiving."
55,26,Having a friend that wears a mask is what makes me a sceptic. I think that it's a good idea to vaccinate your kids.
57,26,"It's kind of creepy to me because they have a history of a lot of people who have no idea. They are probably aware of the effects of the virus and can't seem to get around the stigma surrounding it unless they have a mask or something. Then again, I never grew up with a friend who had a CDC."
64,26,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.This is all about people who are really into the world - they're so fucking brave that they can't even stand the thought of wearing a mask.
67,26,CANNOTANSWER - I've had a dog named Jamya who was born in 1898 I think that's a nice comment on this post.
75,26,"Apparently the government isn't incompatible with what they say, a prank. The government is trying to control that and so it's not the best course of action in the whole thing."
26,16,I like to see all of the comments about the CDC and Obama on there. It's amazing that the people of the United States have a policy that only prevents people from having vaccines. They aren't all the same.
26,22,"That was so funny, that I wanted to laugh at this and then I realized there's no way to stop it. I didn't even try."
31,26,"... But what if someone was being very disrespectful, even when they were telling you this?"
35,26,"I think this is a bit of a ""porn"" kind of joke. Besides, what a joke is."
37,26,"This is why we have a statewide mask mandate. I'm assuming he's not a doctor, but a doctor who hasn't given any medical advice to you. The whole ""I am not a lawyer, I am a lawyer. It is not. I am not a lawyer, but I can help you."" quote came from [N.Y.C.]. The point is that it's a big deal, but it's important that the CDC and the NIH know how to use a mask and make sure they don't"
38,26,They want to prevent pandemics. The fact that the CDC is in the US is probably going to get you a lot of fucking trouble.
44,26,"Yes, the government has a right to make people wear a mask."
45,26,"A person who wears a mask outside is a python, not a python."
55,26,I don't think it's a good idea to do vaccination. I think it's a better idea to get it done.
57,26,"OP said it's a great reference, and he's not the CDC's head, but an anti -masked, anti-hijacking conspiracy theorist."
64,26,> This is pretty much a troll phrase:

37,26,"I like you for this. Basically speaking a lot of people don't even know what a mask is. It sounds like you're trying to help people get a vaccine, and you don't know what it's about. That's a great way to deal with a rash and be able to have a conversation with people about how to prevent it. This is a good way to have people talk about the rash, but the point is that it's more important than knowing someone's actual place of existence."
38,26,My father volunteered for a vaccine program for cancer patients because he was sick of papilloma.
44,26,"I think the government in Texas isn't allowed to wear masks, because the people claiming they are sick are fucking the government."
45,26,Is that the same r/narcissists I used to know? I would be more averse to wearing a mask in the public place than to wearing one during the day. I don't know how to handle it.
55,26,I see no point in wearing the mask.
57,26,It's a lot to do with the amount of people who don't wear a mask.
64,26,"It seems you can't really understand this. I mean, they have a lot of things to say about wearing a mask, but this isn't the first time you've heard this. I'd like to know a little more about the context of the topic. What I would say is that if you want to get up and talk about your empathy, it's really going to be a good start."
67,26,"Vaccination is not a right and a responsibility, it is a duty of the person who is vaccinated."
75,26,"My wife had a pandemic and I had to wear a mask every time she was there, sadly."
26,16,Is the CDC a troll?
26,22,">A person who wears a mask outside is a python, not a python. I don't think it's a good idea to do vaccination. I think it's a better idea to get it done."
31,26,The 'why is it a joke' thing is very common and in a lot of countries this is considered as a joke.
35,26,The CDC is a bit odd. It's about a very specific policy and one that's not in place to get people to wear a mask. I think it's a funny joke because it is a 'no problem' policy.
37,26,You can tell the difference between a doctor with a mask and a doctor with a mask. You just tell the difference between a doctor and a doctor. There is no difference between the two.
38,26,I think you're just being oblivious to the fact that you're putting pressure on a friend in a prank.
44,26,"It's an issue of ""what do you do when you're sick""? ""If you get sick you will be infected."""

57,26,"""We're a bunch of trolls, we should be doing something like this."""
64,26,I am going to guess if I wear a mask on a run.
67,26,"It's not about vaccines. It's about protecting the people who do it. There are things that don't work, but they can't fix or prevent something like that, and a virulent one isn't going to work."
75,26,">I don't think there is a big problem with wearing a mask, or not knowing what a papilloma virus and vaccine is not a prank."
26,16,I'd be tempted to start an argument in r/politics about a possible prank.
26,22,"I don't think we're seeing a big problem here. Vaccination does not work, but it isn't a prank."
31,26,This is one of those things where the government is essentially trying to hide its 'taylorville' mentality.
35,26,"I read a book called ""Another story about a kid who had been vaccinated."" Its a pretty good one. And it's good for your brain. It's been very good for your body and if it's a good idea to make the kids wear masks they'll get better. There's a lot more to it than just a small amount of ""innocence"" to them.

75,26,"I've been told by some people that wearing a mask isn't a prank and that a lot of things aren't a prank. In my experience, a mask isn't exactly a prank if it's too loud or too loud. I can't think of any good things you could do if you were going to do it for fun."
26,16,"It's so funny how people think if they were only at an event for fun, that the whole ""why do you want to be at an event?"" thing is a pretty good one."

38,26,There is a joke about him not getting vaccines because he does not feel comfortable with it. It's not a joke that he needs to wear it. It's a joke that is about a lot of people complaining about the government and that he's just doing something silly. It's not the same thing as a joke.
44,26,Why can't we all wear a mask at work? Because our NSA is using masks to prevent the spread of a virus.
45,26,I'd like to add that this is the most shady and arrogant thing I've read in a while.
55,26,"This is a joke, not a joke. I'm going to be lying to myself about the CDC and saying they need to get some health care done for the people in charge of protecting us from the ebola epidemic."
57,26,It's also a part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask is a major part of helping stop the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask is a major part of helping stop the spread of AIDS.

60,29,"I like this, but I think this might sound like a gimmick..."
77,29,"My wife and I went to the grocery store, went to a doctor and the doctor was very rude and apologetic. He said they had a good reason to wear the mask so I was like Oh yeah I can wear a mask and be nice to you! But my friend still hid in a pj and he took it out and told me he loved him. I told him he wore the mask and he got upset, and was like ""I didn't think it was a lie"" so I knew it was a lie."

35,29,What a dick. This is the exact same thing that makes me think of all the government programs that were started by the president a few years ago.
41,29,Well... that would be a lot of problems if people had the freedom to wear a mask.
50,29,"Wearing a mask makes you feel like you're on the right track. It's a nice way to let people know that they don't think it's a big deal and that they don't want to be vaccinated. That is, if they think it's a big deal and they don't want to be vaccinated, they don't want to be vaccinated."
60,29,Is there any question to the 'avoid' part about how people think that wearing a mask is not helping the spread of a virus?
77,29,"It's not a good idea to run a marathon. It's not like it's to keep someone able to go to work on the weekend or something like that. Its not a good idea to run a marathon or go to the races.

This is the exact same thing that makes me think of all the government programs that were started by the president a few years ago."
41,29,Vaccination is about prevention. We need to be more proactive about preventative health.
50,29,It’s a nice way to let people know that they don’t think it’s a big deal and that they don’t want to be vaccinated.
60,29,"It doesn't look like an innate ability to care for an infection, just a need to do a job that is in a tight setting. You can wear a mask, and no matter what you want, the way you want it to be is in a tight setting. A mask that's actually not a mask will not prevent a disease. It's a way to help protect you against a disease. It's all part of a health care system, you can choose the kind of mask that you can wear. There is a lot of them in public,"
77,29,"That's actually pretty awesome. If I'm running, I'm going to wear a mask. My friend does. But he has to sneeze at me he needs to go to work. He also needs to wear a mask and wear a hat. He needs to wear it."
81,29,I slapped this shit on my partner.

60,29,"They're in the US gov't but it's not in any way necessary for people to put on a mask. People can wear any sort of mask. And you can wear any kind of mask you want. You can wear whatever mask you want, so I can be pretty sure people who don't wear a mask will not think of it as a 'failure' unless they are vaccinated."
77,29,"It seems like a lot of people are trying to push the idea of people wearing masks and it's like people are talking about people who aren't in a position to use it. In any case, it would have to be a big deal to keep everyone from having a problem with something if people don't know what is going on in the world. So, what you just described sounds a little bit like a ""nanny situation"". You sound a lot more like an inexperienced guy."
81,29,"I don't think the government is going to make it like this. I think a mask is a very limiting and ineffective tool that a lot of people are unwilling to use for the purpose of protecting themselves. Besides, I don't think the CDC should have to enforce it unless it has to."

44,30,I think the fact that a person is attempting to prevent a virus is a sign of that. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. I don't see how that will stop a virus from spreading.

41,30,What? You're just saying we're getting a bit of a morale crusade. What if you get a free one?
42,30,I was very lucky that my brother had a std for the first time in his entire life.
44,30,There's a great article on the internet about people using masks to stop a virus from spreading. It's written by [as in: [how to](http://www.gov.uk/hgb/fd/politics/dhhgg/snasp_sp/nodal_war_comments/gspssn/polite/political_war_management.pdf).
47,30,This is the real problem with the country. It was a disaster and the government couldn't stop the spreading of a virus.
54,30,I'd just be a little more confused.
66,30,"When a sane and competent doctor decides to remove a mask, a good doctor will put in a new one so they can prevent it from spreading. A good doctor will let a person stay at a hospital for 2 months, and they're going to have a better chance at finding the proper vaccine."
67,30,"It's the other way around. In many places it's difficult to keep people from getting vaccinated, but they don't have any kind of protection. The only thing they can do is make sure the public knows what they are doing, and the people who have been in a vaccination will know that."
91,30,"If you're not on the Internet, you have a huge problem."
93,30,I've always wondered whether this is the same as it was in the article. Wearing a mask on a run is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
94,30,"I can see the movie on my phone with the caption ""I like wearing a mask because i can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows"

44,30,"I don't see why the government doesn't have a right to make people wear a mask, it's just how it's made people, and it's what drives a lot of the bigotry.

91,30,This is the kind of quote I would be willing to pass up if I were you. I'm not. You've never heard of that saying before. You're not wrong.
93,30,"Is a mask a joke? Because if it is, you can see why it's a joke. I've never even thought of it. Then again, I just wear a mask. I'm not a scientist, but I think it's a joke."
94,30,I do not see why people will get to wear masks. But the idea that people wear them for a reason or for the same reason as them is ridiculous.

41,30,"This isn't a troll comment, it's a fact and not a political comment."
42,30,"I am in Florida and my mom and grandmother have been doing this to me. I was being vaccinated with one of the anti virologic medicines and they were able to help vaccinate me when I wasn't wearing a mask. The first time I was in Florida, I did it out of sheer curiosity."

91,30,What the NSA is doing is a horrible idea.
93,30,There are 2 types of masks - the mask used in the wiki article is just another haterly joke.

67,30,It's the right thing to do. A bit of that is really pretty obvious.

91,30,"...I'd consider a mask on the sidewalk or in a public area and make it a point to wear one as soon as possible ""We have an agenda to disenfranchise people. The NSA is concerned with how its working to spread the virus.....and they probably wouldn't mind if they don't think they are infected."""
93,30,I wear a mask every holiday and i'm always feeling like the joke is the best thing to do. But then I just start to wonder how much of this is actually being done. I wore a mask as a kid and that was the first time I had one.

32,23,"Is there any way I can make a cynical, racist, or narcissist joke about something that isn't a joke?"
34,32,"So, it's just a prank? Because it's a prank. I think you should see a doctor who is trained to make the effort to keep the public safe.

Because it’s the government’s way of ensuring the spread of a virus and whatnot."

47,32,I'm not sure I understand why the CDC isn't doing anything. A mask of the virus can actually be used to spread the disease. The CDC is basically trying to help people with it.

60,32,"I can't believe the CDC hasn't released a new version of it in a long time, but I can confirm that it is part of a vaccination if they will not put a mask on. They are also the only public health agency that isn't required to wear the mask in public. I'd be a little bit more concerned with how the CDC is addressing a health problem, since they are only providing aid to prevent those who are being attacked. They aren't committing a vaccine."

84,33,"I mean, it's not a virus, it's a medical condition and the government does not want it. This is not even a question about what you think about a person doing this. It's just an expression that people take for granted."

33,1,"The only thing they are doing is being a dick to people, who are afraid of being a dick. They want to keep a person out of the system, to prevent the spread of a virus."
33,5,You could get a copy of this book as a gift or a book with the book. Because that's a good idea.
54,33,What's the point of a mask?
58,33,"I like to wear my mask in the shower, if you ask me."
65,33,"So, you're talking about the prank-based treatment of a sick person, not the death penalty if the person gets a mask."
67,33,"So, a doctor being cited for not wearing a mask at Christmas."
84,33,I agree that I do not care about the government. The fact that it is acting as a big threat has me confused.

58,33,"I have some strangely retorts, but that I didn't see until I read it: ""You wear a mask in the shower"""
65,33,It's a joke. The prank is a joke. You don't read it.
67,33,Yes I agree with everyone who says the government is a joke and the UK is in it. The NSA is in a bit of a bind. I'm guessing there is an American person with a bad temper who wears a mask in order to prevent the spread of HIV.
84,33,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.If you feel this way, if the NSA is a big threat then you are probably right."

93,33,">I wear a mask on a run. It's hard to tell when my face isn't shattered by a virus. I don't know why but this is why I can't get it.

38,34,"I hate the government - but I would love to be able to help people who need help with things like vaccines. I think the government is inefficient and they should stop making the jokes for a better time, or at least help people who don't know about it."
47,34,The NSA's inaction has nothing to do with the fact that the CDC doesn't actually have a way of stopping the spread of a virus. They're going to use this idea as a smear campaign to get more people sick. That's why they do things like that.
54,34,You guys are shady.
60,34,"Wearing a mask while sick and breaking a skin barrier, and bending it over, is really the only way to get a vaccine."
67,34,"The guy says that the NSA is trying to help me and that the guy is just trying to help me, but he's not letting you do whatever he wants."
75,34,What? We're talking about the CDC.
100,34,"... I think it is more like saying, ""If you get sick you will be infected."""
34,2,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
34,9,">I don't think he knows what it is, so it's a very dumb joke. I think it's a prankster."
34,11,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
34,12,"This is a lot like the CDC's memo that says, ""We need a vaccine to stop the spread of viruses."" It says, ""We need a vaccine to stop the spread of viruses."""
34,20,[NAME]: I don't know any more. I can't believe the CDC is using the same jokes to get more people sick. I think it's a joke.
34,21,I like how they're going to make this a lot of jokes because it's like they have been using a mask for so long that they will never get a response.
34,23,"I think this one is a little less funny than others, because I'm pretty sure the guy in the middle said he's never worn a mask, or even thought it was the only way to stop the spread of this illness."
34,24,"I'm trying to figure out what the CDC and their staff would like to hear if it is a prank. This is just a joke, they aren't making the jokes they're making."
34,32,It's a joke and you are not being serious.
38,34,Is the government doing their job well? There are so many ways to get money back a government contractor is just a joke. It's not the same as a joke.
47,34,"This is an interesting point. I’ve just been vaccinated with a CDC vaccination, and I was fine, as long as it wasn’t wearing a mask and infected with it, I wasn’t even able to wear a mask at all."
54,34,A mask can be used to stop people from spitting viruses and even to try to spread them through the feces and blood vessels.
60,34,I have no idea what it is or how it works. I'm a little bit in the minority but a lot of my family wear a mask in the midst of a virus. Vaccination is the quickest and most effective cure for a virus. It works great when I'm not in the flu. I'm a doctor. The Doctor knows I'm a doctor and has an issue with it. The Doctor will tell you that you want to wear a mask.
67,34,I do not believe that it's a joke. It's basically saying that someone is invading your personal health.
75,34,What if you're not going to a party with a house full of pythons? Are they not having a pandemic?
100,34,You're a very funny person.
34,2,"The CDC has actually been telling us that as they get more vaccines, there will be more people infected by the virus."
34,9,"I am a doctor and wear masks with a lot of friends who aren't doctors, but they were all vaccinated."
34,11,"The CDC is making a joke and then attempting to put a mask on your head, or worse, he has a mask that he is actually using to stop you from getting sick and getting sick and a mask will be able to take you to a doctor for the next three months so you can get vaccinated for your own medical reasons. I don't know what they're talking about, but you're a very funny person."
34,12,This is a joke based on the fact that you are trying to get the government to stop the spread of a virus.
34,20,I think the only joke I get out of this is that the CDC has some form of safety protocol where you can be seen by a mask. I like it because it's easy to get sick and the CDC knows everything about it.
34,21,"If someone has a sick person in their family, it is a prank."
34,23,">I think it's called the ""Pretty Important Rule."""
34,24,I like how the CDC is using the same jokes to get more people sick. I think it's a joke.
34,32,"They're putting some very dumb, very stupid jokes in here."
38,34,I'd like to add that I know some people who do a mask in order to stop the spread of the virus. I don't really like that the government doesn't cut their funding either.
47,34,"I feel like I could have made this joke just fine. I don’t care for masks and don’t like wearing one. But if I could, I would."
54,34,There's nothing in this article about how a mask works - that it's a good idea but not what people actually want.
60,34,This is just a joke and the doctor isn't a politician. He's talking about a doctor's question.
67,34,"I think you should see a doctor who is trained to make the effort to keep the public safe. Vaccination is a right and a responsibility, but there’s no moral requirement to make people who aren’t vaccinated be vaccinated."
75,34,So is this a prank? Because it's a prank. It's the government's way of ensuring the spread of a virus and whatnot.

34,2,"Isn't this actually about being a doctor? Because I don't think so, and I don't think it's a joke."
34,9,I don't think the CDC is trying to get the government to stop the spread of a virus.
34,11,"I am so sick of cdc people. I love the CDC. I am scared of what could happen. I know that. It's just not a joke. But I have never thought of them as a joke, I've never imagined a government that made a joke about that kind of behavior."
34,12,>I think the only joke I get out of this is that the CDC has some form of safety protocol where you can be seen by a mask. I like it because it's easy to get sick and the CDC knows everything about it.
34,20,You can't be a prankster and still get sick. We do not use masks. We need the money.
34,21,I know a lot of people who wear masks but they don't want to get into the hands of the people they want to prevent a pandemic.
34,23,The CDC is making a joke. They are putting this joke in this thread because they think people are using it as a way to stop the spread of a virus.
34,24,"I think I'm going to have to give the CDC a call, but I would have to give it to you if I thought it was a joke."
34,32,"So, it's just a prank? Because it's a prank. I think you should see a doctor who is trained to make the effort to keep the public safe. Vaccination is a right and a responsibility, but there’s no moral requirement to make people who aren’t vaccinated be vaccinated. So is this a prank? Because it’s the government’s way of ensuring the spread of a virus and whatnot."
38,34,People can get sick when they get infected.
47,34,"Yeah, you're being very clever here, but I want you to know this:"
54,34,I think that it's a very small part of the problem and why people think it's funny.
60,34,I’m not a doctor. I’m a doctor. I’m a doctor.
67,34,"Vaccination is a right, it's a moral obligation, and I think a doctor should be able to make the right decision."
75,34,I think that you are overly critical of the CDC.
100,34,"This isn't just a joke - this is a story about someone who actually wears a mask in order to hide their identity. I have heard of this story too. This is not a joke, but this is a story about one of our kids. It is in the title and it is actually a joke, but its also not a joke, and it is a joke. It is a joke and not a joke. It is not a joke, but a joke. And it is also a shit joke for the people around it to say"

78,35,took my first flight in months for a work trip everyone wore a mask everyone was respectful of other people reminds you not all people suck most but not all
83,35,those who want to protect themselves from getting sick have every right to masks keep you more safe than no mask in tight settings everyone has the right to do whatever they want now at their discretion
35,1,"OP, you ARE a man and you are an activist for a cause."
35,5,"We all have different reasons not to wear masks. There is a reason that it would be more important for doctors to not wear them. We grew up in a place where the health care system was supposed to be a medical institution, and that a mask was not as important as the safety of our children."
35,6,Isn't a solution portland oregon?>
35,8,"Oh, sorry, I was reading it as a joking comment. The wording and meaning is not correct. The only reason to wear a mask is to do something in public places where it can be a real inconvenience, which in turn is a security risk."
35,11,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
35,16,Hey! What's up?  We're here to help you!
35,17,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
35,21,We're in an environment where people should be able to play sport without masks.
35,26,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
35,29,"I work in the U.S. military, and this is about what it's like to be a a prick in the military, not the federal government."
35,31,I'm a nurse and I don't want to be a jerk about a topic like this.
41,35,I don't want to be with people who think that they have a right to wear a mask.
51,35,I think you are missing the point where the guy is referring to the federal government vs. state which focuses on preventing a pandemic.
53,35,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
54,35,>hey i just saw you are running miles across florida right now curious if you would share what is the route im in orlando and would love to come run with you even if just for a mile i d wear a mask and keep distance

77,35,I think I agree with him and he seems to be quite supportive.
78,35,"It's a great post and is a little underrated, but I have seen people post on it and it seems like a good example of someone taking a long time to get through the day."
83,35,wear a mask and bend over and get a full-blown cold.
35,1,"You are saying that the only reason to wear a mask is to do something in public places where it can be a real inconvenience, which in turn is a security risk. Isn't a solution portland oregon?"
35,5,"If you aren't a nurse and your questioning isn't true, and if you want to be a doctor for the sake of preventing the spread of a virus, you should be a nurse. If your question is anything like ""What is the most important thing to wear in public places?"" that is absolutely absurd. I would advise anyone who wants to help out who can help with the issues at hand that they might be in."
35,6,A good example is the part of the steps deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
35,8,Then what's going on here? It's not about preventing a pandemic. It's about the military and health care systems. I think the government needs to focus more on cutting healthcare costs.
35,11,Hey! What's up? We're here to help you! Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
35,16,Hey! What's up? We're here to help you! Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

35,21,They aren't allowed to do it.
35,26,> We're in an environment where people should be able to play sport without masks. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
35,29,No I'm not being a jerk. I'm a nurse and I don't really want to be with people who think that they have a right to wear a mask.
35,31,I'm a nurse and this is a legitimate topic... what do you mean? The government uses masks to prevent spread of a virus in the USA.
41,35,"> ""The government is giving a right to wear a mask, which is a form of protest."
51,35,>I like that i was in a conservative county in california and i voted against the repeal of it. what kind of laws do you think they uphold?
53,35,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
54,35,So it's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
55,35,It's not part of the measures deployed by the government to stop the spread of a virus. It's part of the measures employed by the government to aid in stopping the spread.
59,35,"Affirmative action is not an emergency. In addition, it is required to be worn for a minimum of 7 days before the outbreak. The CDC's recommendations are part of the plan as it is not a permanent one. This is one of those issues that needs to be addressed. This is an emergency and it doesn't make sense to do that when the pandemic was a few days in advance of the CDC's re-enactment of the policy."
77,35,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.really interesting in light of people s resistance to wear a mask both the mask and the shopping cart are measurements of empathy really interesting in light of people s resistance to wear a mask both the mask and the shopping cart are measurements of empathy
78,35,"afaik the same post by the same person, it's more relevant in this context, than I would have guessed."
83,35,"In the US, it's called a mask, and it is basically just a safety feature that is only used to keep people away from viruses. The CDC and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) aren't the only people that have been infected, and most of the people who have been infected still have the same mask."
35,1,I mean I wouldn't call my job because I'm in the military. I'd say it's part of what they do to prevent the spread of a virus. So it's an important safety feature. And you think people have a right to wear a mask.
35,5,"I've got a mask on and I need to go up to it, I'm not wearing it because it doesn't look nice."
35,6,It is a security issue.

35,17,They aren't allowed to do it. They aren't allowed to do it.
35,21,I'm not a nurse. But this isn't a solution to a problem. I am talking about something more important to me than a virus. The thing I want to do is to look out for you.
35,26,The government can't use a mask to stop a virus from spreading. It needs to stop a virus from spreading through the government.
35,29,"The government is making an effort to stop spread of a virus, while making it a problem. If it doesn't work as intended, then what do you expect?"
35,31,The US government is a bit over the top. Its not like it is doing any good in its own right. They're all part of the government's health care infrastructure.

35,5,I don't know what you mean by this. It seems like the only thing I see from a doctor's perspective is a sandbox of a mask and a mask that's a security feature.
35,6,"I've been in the military and it seems like the whole ""Filming a fuckin'mask"" thing just comes up and makes the world look like a joke."
35,8,I can imagine what this kind of attitude is getting to me as someone who is just using an excuse to have a mumps infection.

78,35,I think you're missing the whole point of the post.
83,35,You can have a full-blown cold (that is why I didn’t wear it). Wearing a mask is a good idea but you don’t necessarily want to wear a mask in those settings.
35,1,"Vaccination in general, a form of protection, is required to prevent infection, but it is not necessary to prevent infection, and is used to prevent it. It is a health tool. The FDA recommends a mask as a safety measure."

35,16,"It's a prank, but no he doesn't have to be in the hospital to be in the hospital to be in the hospital to have it on. The CDC's goal is to prevent the spread of a virus. They have to have a prank on the medical staff, not on the government."
35,17,I believe in the truth. The US can't even make a big deal about the fact that you should not be vaccinated unless you have a helmet. This is a joke and no joke. The CDC has been doing a ton of things in the past.

54,35,"So, when you get sick, they have to come in to take care of you."
55,35,The first person I saw referring to the CDC'secret mission' was to stop the spread of a virus. 'They knew they were coming to stop this and gave away some evidence of this as a joke and a joke.

The only time I feel like that is on Christmas and the joke's on my bday, I wear a mask because the person I'm talking about is on Christmas, and I don't feel like my parents would care enough to tell me what to do with the money they're spending on me. It's a nice idea, though."
85,36,I'm gonna say something along the lines of:
87,36,>Making a mask outside while vaccinated is an awful thing to do when it comes to vaccinating people.
89,36,"I have to agree with you in a bit of a ways, but in this case it’s a joke that can work. I mean I want a good hat and I can get a decent headshot with a mask, but I don’t want to put the head up on my head and make a mess."
90,36,"Honestly, it's pretty normal. It's a little different than a lot of those, but it's very common."
91,36,...and the worst part of this is that the government isn't interested in supporting anyone who can stop it and is attempting to stop it.
93,36,"In all fairness, this a joke, but it's a joke, and it makes sense."
95,36,We wear a mask and wear a mask and wear a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend over Please
99,36,I don't see how anything that's funny or funny is a good idea.
100,36,"People who don't know what a walking mask is, are really weird. I know some people who do that, but I don't know where the term is originally from. I know the description for it is a little bit misleading....I think the real problem with wearing a mask is that it doesn't really address the issue that is spreading."
37,36,It doesn't address the issue. It's more important than knowing someone's actual place of existence.
51,36,"There's a big difference between a mask and a real person, and a real person can be a python to the extent that it's part of a mask, as long as you're not the one causing the virus."
54,36,"It's not about whether or not it's a good idea, it's about how government and private entities create and protect their own people."
67,36,"In the states with the highest rates of vaccination for vaccines, vaccines and ebola vaccines are allowed at the hospital. I would recommend an outside vaccinate, if you're not vaccinated. It would be easier to do your own research and not rely on some one's judgement, which would also work in the field."
81,36,"I am in the UK, and I would recommend this article to anyone interested in HIV testing."
85,36,"I'm sorry you're being disrespectful. I'm sorry, but I'm sorry it was a joke."
87,36,"Why do you hate ranting about the government? You're a doctor and if you don't know how to be a good human being, you will likely end up in the middle of a rant about something you don't think is a good idea. I'm sorry, but there are many people out there who might also want to know what's going on."
89,36,"I've done a lot of this before. I don't really care about your health, it's just a fun idea."
90,36,"This is what a lot of people feel, in real life. It's not a joke or a joke but something else."
91,36,"I've never heard a person say this: I don't think he's a python, but I've gotten a lot of advice on how to prevent a virus."
93,36,"The idea that people wear masks in the wiki article hasn't been considered ""so far"" from the actual facts, but rather, just ""they"" are more accurate than the media is going to make it sound."
95,36,"My wife's mom always says that she is not able to make a decent living while wearing a mask, so the idea of wearing a mask is pretty interesting. Her comment is really interesting and my husband doesn't make a shit bit of sense of what she's wearing, so she wears a mask and bends over a mask and bends over a mask and bends over a mask and bends over over a mask and bends over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and"
99,36,I've been wearing a mask for the past two years and I love to wear it.
100,36,People can't be infected when they wear a mask. They are trying to show their ineptitude to other people through the world. The difference is that a mask is more important than knowing a person's place of existence.
37,36,"> Vaccination and a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. This is a good point, but one of the main points is that you've blown it out of proportion with what they've said in the past. This is the same'mandate' that Obama used in his presidential campaign."
51,36,"[Porn is a non -committal form of narcotics, and the government isn't going to do any good in trying to combat this.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcotics_Female-Cancer-Virus-Communicatio_Ranges/index.php)"

67,36,"""A lot of this is funny, because the CDC isn't going to give you any reason to be offended at that. It's the best way to save the world. Vaccination is not a right and a responsibility, it is a duty of the person who is vaccinated. It's not ""just part of the"" problem, it is a duty of the person who is vaccinated. It's not a right and a responsibility, it is a duty of the person who is vaccinated."
81,36,This is so fucked up. We're in the middle of a major crisis. The US government is trying to get rid of the CDC's shit-shit. The federal government isn't about preventing it.
85,36,"I've got a little bit to go for but I've already made a big effort to be a positive influence and help the dogs. I can't be bothered to write or talk about that on this sub. My wife is a bit of a fucking freak and I need to get back into the know and do something. But I am willing to make a statement about the NSA, especially since you've already been through the NSA. I'm so sorry it's a joke and a joke!"
87,36,>I'm a doctor and vaccinated with the AIDS virus.
89,36,"A lot of the people who take part in this thread are really just curious because their thoughts aren't that relevant anymore. What's it that sucks, is that they don't really understand what they're talking about."
90,36,i don't think it's funny. I think it's funny to tell people that i'm not really a virus person
91,36,"if someone is infected by a virus, why are they so concerned about the safety of everyone in the world? I'd consider a mask on the sidewalk or in a public area and make it a point to wear one as soon as possible"
93,36,So the story goes like this: People with a mask are wearing masks to help ward off the virus.
95,36,"It's a slew of words – ',"
99,36,"> In my experience, people who buy masks don't even wear masks for the holidays. In fact they do make it easier to get away from the virus, which they can't avoid at all."
100,36,"I can't imagine what that means when it comes to the idea of wearing a mask, but if you can't tell how many times you are wearing a mask when you are in an area where you can't tell what a python is you may need a mask. It's more like saying ""If you get sick you will be infected."""
37,36,I'm not sure how people get away with a nice one:
51,36,So this isn't just a joke.
54,36,The guy has to wear a mask for a number of reasons:
67,36,"Vaccination is a right and a responsibility, but there's no moral requirement to make the person who isn't vaccinated be vaccinated."
81,36,"You're referring to a joke and not the CDC, the CDC's policy."
85,36,"> ""Wearing a mask doesn't help stop the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask doesn't help stopping the spread of a virus."", ""There are plenty of other dogs who have their own problems, and while they may have no problems with their own problems, they have very little information about it. No, it’s not funny."

90,36,"The prank doesn't work, the prank just doesn't come close to it. It's like people aren't getting the chance to be funny, but they are putting a prank on people and pranking them, and they are pranking each other."
91,36,"""Won't a NSA agent wear a mask for you to be sick?"""
93,36,"I was gonna say a little to the effect of ""Use a mask to prevent or prevent a virus. I would say this isn't the correct response."""

37,36,[Did a doctor ever give you a mask in his home state?](https://www.cnn.gov/public/topics/dicks/dicks-comments-seniors-to-infectious-virus) is a great piece of shit.

54,36,I'm going to run this for fun.
67,36,"As long as you wear a mask and don't get infected by AIDS virus, that's still a good idea."
81,36,"As someone who has a VERY HIFI-prone wife, I'm so relieved."
85,36,I'm not going to try to explain it for you. I'm going to make a post about a dog named 'James' in which I'm an incredibly inflammatory and evil company that tries to repress any fear of trolls by praising people who make assumptions and mistreat a vulnerable human.
87,36,I've gotten my shit together and they all look like idiots. They all have shit together and troll posts to tell them why they can't go to the doctor.
89,36,"The CDC is focusing on stopping the spread of a virus.It's not a joke, it's a prank, it's a prank."
90,36,a prank is about the fact that he is a good person and not a doctor.
91,36,>It sounds like the guy is an old CIA agent. What the NSA is doing is a horrible idea.
93,36,>I wear a mask on a run. It's hard to tell when my face isn't shattered by a virus. I don't know why but this is why I can't get it.

99,36,This has been written a few times. There's really nothing they can do about it. People don't need a mask for the holidays. It's a little 'just the way people dress for Christmas' type thing.
100,36,You think a mask is a bad idea?
37,36,Vaccination and a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
51,36,A mask should prevent people from getting sick from a virus.
54,36,"This is a great idea, although you might be misinformed."
67,36,The US gov't needs to enforce the laws. I'm not sure where you're coming from.
81,36,"The article says that the CDC isn't doing it, and so there is a lot of talk about it."
85,36,"I think a lot of the people that write this can't do it, but my husband and I've done all we can to help the dogs."
87,36,"Vaccination is the worst vaccination possible, unless it's in fact a non-higgins virus. Vaccination is the worst."
89,36,I think I read the whole thing. It doesn't make sense to me.
90,36,So what's the point of the prank? I like to run a prank because I like my friends and my business and that's when they prank.
91,36,"I like how the government acts like a parasite. You can’t just stop an irrational horde from spreading it. You have to get out the door and wear a mask - you can’t even try to stop them in the middle of the night - and be a jerk, but the NSA isn’t taking the threat if they don’t prevent it. I don’t want to give you any idea if the NSA is going to go after you because you can’t fucking safe environment without one."
93,36,"I've learned that most of this stuff comes from the ""people"" of the United States. They use the words ""fucking things"" and ""so-and-so"" and the ""what ifs"" when referring to people who wear masks. So, it's interesting that people are being manipulated."
95,36,You're wearing a mask
99,36,"No, I didn't. And no, I was not being sarcastic. I'm being sarcastic, as usual, as I'm just saying that there's a big gap between wearing and being sick. People shouldn't wear masks, it doesn't look good or good or healthy. And I don't see how a good thing that is actually made, especially when the sick person does it, is a bad idea."
100,36,I was in a similar situation. The thing was more about a python costume.

83,37,those who want to protect themselves from getting sick have every right to masks keep you more safe than no mask in tight settings everyone has the right to do whatever they want now at their discretion
85,37,a special shout out goes to mr londono and ms latorre we loved the teachable moment of mask wearing and addressing covid questions also a very happy birthday to our vebbulldog jamya
95,37,we keep hearing about how most kids quickly recover from covid pretty hard to recover from this wear a mask and if you can get vaccinated
100,37,really interesting in light of people s resistance to wear a mask both the mask and the shopping cart are measurements of empathy
37,6,i hate that the whole world isn't sane enough for the government to cut education funding.
37,10,He has a pretty awesome attitude towards the kids that he tries to push through a mask mandate.
37,12,What’s that “We have the right to do whatever we want in tight settings everybody has the right to do”?
37,13,"This has a whole slew of sexy connotations, even in the context of politics and political rhetoric. The one thing that people say is I don't think he's in the state he lives in is that he's not wearing a mask when there is a virus."

37,26,I was a doctor that was the only person in the state I knew who had a virus. I never got to see him for anything except a mask. I thought I was the first to ask him about that but then he told me he needed a statewide mask and I was fine with it.
37,36,"There is not much they can do about the cost of vaccines, but it does give you a lot of information about statewide mask mandates."
56,37,"Yes, I agree with you. There are a lot of ways to protect yourself in America. I would have to work harder for myself."
83,37,"I'm in a small hospital right now, and wearing a mask doesn't have any effect on your safety."

100,37,"I believe in a lot of things, people who have never heard of the ''walking mask '' and then put on a mask are a bunch of people who didn't even understand what was going on, and people who never saw the mask were actually people who had not yet seen the mask in their daily lives."
37,6,"I agree with the whole post, but I'm going to argue it's only because of that. The best way to protect yourself is to get vaccinated."
37,10,I don't know. I'm trying to be very honest about this - I was just wondering if you know what I mean by that. I gotta be real!
37,12,i don’t know. i don’t know what the statewide mask mandate actually means. they’re just laws.
37,13,[NAME] is a lawyer.
37,16,"Basically this guy is going to have to be vaccinated by the time he's cured, but that's just my opinion and doesn't really matter to the person."
37,26,"I had this question before, how does it work? How is it the government that mandates the masks?"
37,36,"And yet, she is wearing her mask on the day of her birthday, so..."
56,37,"I hate to be an agnostic and anti-vaccination anti-virus advocate, but I know it's a very important thing."
83,37,"I've had my first child wear a mask on a regular basis, but after several days it doesn't seem to have a lasting effect."
85,37,Almost like people are going to buy a hammer that can just be worn on their birthday. I had a friend come out and say that they wear a mask all the time and it is actually actually kind of a joke.
95,37,"I like to put on a mask and bend over to prevent someone else from putting on a mask. Vaccination, and a mask can be very effective in preventing a virus in humans from causing cancer in humans. I don't like to wear a mask and bend over to prevent a virus from being transmitted."

37,10,I cried last week because I wore a mask in my bathroom and walked down the hallway. I don't like to wear a mask.
37,12,"Is the state government liable for the cost of the statewide mask mandate? Or is it a law, like the state of Tennessee?"

83,37,"I've had a patient on the same list for years, and only had one infection (the CDC and NIH), and then I was on it, for weeks at most, and it's been all over the place for two years. They said I have no issue with it, but I don't think I've ever been hurt in anything."

100,37,...I think the real problem with wearing a mask is that it doesn't really address the issue that is spreading. It's that it's more important than knowing a person's actual place of existence.

37,16,"It's the right thing to do, and I don't think it's worth it to have a person in a hospital, because you can't make people say their health is better. I don't think the person who wears a mask is the person that is getting sick."

83,37,"The CDC and NIH have already implemented a system that requires the use of a mask on an unprotected patient, and then sends them to the hospital to be re-certified to wear a mask after a fever comes up. The fact that a mask doesn't have any effect on the child is really scary."
85,37,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
95,37,"I like to put on a mask and bend over to prevent someone else from putting on a mask. Vaccination, and a mask can be very effective in preventing a virus in humans from causing cancer in humans. I don't like to wear a mask and bend over to prevent a virus from being transmitted. You can't help it when you have to, but you can help it when you need to."""
100,37,You're talking about the problem of wearing a mask when you're trying to talk about people wearing a mask in order to show them that they have a valid point of view on the matter. I've never understood that.
37,6,"This is the real question, and it is not a question about if they want to or do not have a proper policy on how to handle it."
37,10,I'm really sorry but that's not my situation. Having a bad day isn't a bad thing and I really feel like I have to go to the doctor.
37,12,He’s trying to stop a virus from spreading. It’s not about what to say. The people who wear it are trying to protect themselves and their family from viruses.
37,13,"Yes, it's a bad idea. Vaccination and masks are part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
37,16,It is not really the same thing as a medical advice.
37,26,"I like you for this. Basically speaking a lot of people don't even know what a mask is. It sounds like you're trying to help people get a vaccine, and you don't know what it's about. That's a great way to deal with a rash and be able to have a conversation with people about how to prevent it. This is a good way to have people talk about the rash, but the point is that it's more important than knowing someone's actual place of existence."
37,36,"> Vaccination and a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. This is a good point, but one of the main points is that you've blown it out of proportion with what they've said in the past. This is the same'mandate' that Obama used in his presidential campaign."
56,37,People want to be protected from diseases. They want the right to die.
83,37,"It's a good idea, but it's not really the right thing to do."
85,37,"I'm really sorry to hear this, but I was able to get away with a nice one:"

100,37,"Wearing a mask in the middle of the day, you could have a really bad time."
37,6,Vaccination isn't what the CDC or NIH wants to do. They've already done it. A mask can prevent a virus.
37,10,"It was a joke! I love it. It’s so easy to have it wrong, but it doesn’t help at all. The only reason I ever do that is to protect my family and get them to wear a mask. It has no idea what it means or what it means or what the government wants them to do. I just don’t care about what the public is seeing and what the government needs for that. It’s more important than knowing someone’s place of existence. I just don’t like it. I’m sure he doesn’t want to give him the benefit"
37,12,"Vaccination and masks are part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. I'm not sure how many people could have done this before. I'm not sure how many people could have done this before. I'm assuming he's not a doctor, but a doctor who hasn't given any medical advice to you."
37,13,I would love to hear how the CDC and NIH are not going to protect a child from HIV and it is a great idea. They are going to want a mask of a vaccine that stops the spread of a virus. That's all.
37,16,"There's a difference between a simple sex ad, a rash ad and a rash ad in general."
37,26,You can tell the difference between a doctor with a mask and a doctor with a mask. You just tell the difference between a doctor and a doctor. There is no difference between the two.
37,36,I'm not sure how people get away with a nice one:
56,37,"[CNN] (http://www.cnn.gov/public/topics/dicks/dicks-comments-seniors-to-infectious-virus) has found an interesting, and often disproven, way to prevent sickening the people living in these areas."
83,37,In California I have a problem with my helmet. I feel so vulnerable. My dentist will give me one because I feel sick and it will cause some serious trouble if I don't know how to use a mask correctly. In my state the doctors may have to use gloves but the meds on the patients may be better suited to the person.
85,37,It was a joke. That was actually funny.
95,37,There is a movie called Mask and Wearing. It combines the two parts of a 'Mask and Wear'.
100,37,"I read that as ""if you get sick you will be infected."""

37,10,That's hilarious. I've heard this one before:
37,12,I'm not a doctor. I'm a doctor. It's an opinion. And a joke. I have no idea what the CDC is talking about. Is it possible that a doctor is trying to keep people from getting HIV because of a vaccine? Is that a joke? Is this a joke? Does it make any sense that the person that's promoting HIV is wearing a mask to help keep people from getting HIV because of it? Or is there some sort of thing they're talking about?
37,13,"A good point, but one of the main points is that you've blown it out of proportion with what they've said in the past."
37,16,"I've never heard a doctor say ""I don't think it's worth it to have a person in a hospital, because I don't think the person who wears a mask is the person that is getting sick."""
37,26,"[Nyc](http://www.cnn.gov/public/topics/dicks/dicks-comments-seniors-to-infectious-virus) has found an interesting, and often disproven, way to prevent sickening the people living in these areas."
37,36,[Did a doctor ever give you a mask in his home state?](https://www.cnn.gov/public/topics/dicks/dicks-comments-seniors-to-infectious-virus) is a great piece of shit.
56,37,"The first sentence is a joke. The second sentence is not a joke. The first sentence is a joke. It sounds like there's some kind of ""serious"" point of view in there but I don't think that's an obvious point."
83,37,"That's really scary. There are so many things you can do that you might not feel comfortable using a mask, because the doctors are too busy treating sick people and they have to put more effort into it."
85,37,"Why does a dog want a mask on her birthday? Does the vebb get sick from the hat being slapped in the face with a mask? I don't think you've got anything to jive with. If your husband feels comfortable with a hat on his birthday, that's fine, because it's your dog."

37,6,The film is made by CNBC.
37,10,"I'm sorry, but I've heard this one before: ""I think you need to go to your doctor and see if your child is getting vaccines or not."
37,12,If someone wears a mask on their birthday they will get sick. If they're not using a mask to protect themselves they'll get sick too. If they don't they will get sick. If they're not using a mask they'll get sick.
37,13,"In a different story, the doctor who wore the mask blew it out of proportion."
37,16,"Despite this joke, I don't think any of it is valid. There is something in here where a doctor is not doing anything to stop the spread of a virus. And then I hear that the mask is not a joke because the people that are infected are the ones that aren't infected."

75,38,don t go to a party with a house full of ppl not wasting mask during a pandemic
76,38,continuing to mask up and distance reduces the transmission of the virus and if you do get it the virus won t leave you your immune system will handle it vaccines also reduce pressure on overwhelmed healthcare systems vaccines mean more milder cases if the vaxxed do get it

38,15,I personally know people that have gotten covid one of them past away this week please wear a mask. They have to wear a mask for this because they want to make others happy and make the people happy.

73,38,he's a dick-faced person. I'm not even a fan of him.
75,38,"I'm not a papilloma guy, I am a papilloma person, so I'm really not sure what the difference is. Vaccination is an issue that I'm interested in but I'm not sure it's any less important than if I had the option to stay away from pandemics or if I was a huge papilloma fanatic. I also want to emphasize that people who aren't in my face are not necessarily the culprit. This is a huge problem and the biggest problem is that"
76,38,My mother has a really strong and frank opinion of vaccination in general. I do not like that people complain. She does not like me complaining about things that aren't doing anything wrong.
82,38,This is a terrible quote. The first part of the quote was quite important. Then it sounded like a joke. The first part of it was just a joke.
92,38,"I'm sorry Mark, but this is a good story."
93,38,It's really important to know that you're not the only person who wants to put yourself at risk. What do you want to protect yourself from? How do you want to protect yourself from the virus? And do you want to help people with the same symptoms? How do you want to make people care?
38,2,he's a dick faced person. I'm not even a fan of him. I'm not even a fan of him.

76,38,I'm a huge anti-virus fan. It's a major health issue. This is a lot more common than most people think. I like to wear my mask as a mask while running around the city and don't have it on. It's a big part of my daily life.
82,38,The first part of it was just a joke.
92,38,I am assuming a number of people in this sub aren't saying the same things.
93,38,"[NAME] [NAME]: You should wear a mask on the run to run to protect yourself, even though your mask might help you."
38,2,You know you don't want to keep yourself at risk for papilloma?
38,15,They have to wear a mask for this because they want to make others happy and make the people happy.
38,26,He is an idiot. I'm not sure if he should wear a mask or if it's not his. He should be using the same type of mask.
38,34,"""I don't get a statewide mask mandate and I hate the fact that they cut education funding."""

I've seen a lot of teh news outlets, and when it goes by it's always just to make people laugh, I'm sure you'll find something good. It can be a good joke, but it can also be very serious. Unless you're going to be snooping and saying, ""No you have no idea how much money's going to happen, it can be a"
92,38,"You're also a python. The problem is that a man with a mask in his mouth might go on a run, because of a virus, and he does not seem to have that confidence in him, so he wouldn't have to go out for a run unless he wanted to wear it every day."
93,38,People who don't get a mask if they get a fad are very likely to be infected with the virus. It's probably not a joke but it makes sense to be around people who don't like it.
38,2,"I know what you mean, but I can't say for sure what the answer is: ""I feel like there are a lot of people in the health care system who have to do this.""

47,38,"A few days ago my wife and I were watching a game of tennis. We just started a new series on Facebook where a CDC member gave a presentation about the risks involved with putting an official virus in a people's eyes when they were at a party, and he said he was putting the mask on her face and not just in case she got sick. We're trying to be sure he doesn't mind but we're not sure what the actual situation was so they put the mask on herself. Eventually, the next time they'll have to"
73,38,"Basically they're essentially saying ""We're going to have a major government government war because the government doesn't care about the virus, that is why we need to do it!"""
75,38,There are a lot of jokes about the government wanting to prevent a pandemic.

92,38,"I was going to make a quick post about why people hate the virus... but instead of going to see it, they want the public to know about it. I guess I am gonna take a long, hard hard look at it because it is actually pretty great, but the point being is that it makes the vaccine seem less harmful, and I was really wishing it would have helped me so much."
93,38,"If the government is not using the crazies of the wiki article, I'd not say it's a joke, because I can't think of a single reason it makes a joke."
38,2,I think a lot of people in the health care system who don't get a vaccine wear one. That's part of the joke.
38,15,"I had a friend who was sick of this kind of stuff. The one person we have had a good impression of was from a guy who said, ""I've got a papilloma and I wear a mask, but I don't want to be that guy."""
38,26,They want to prevent pandemics. The fact that the CDC is in the US is probably going to get you a lot of fucking trouble.

47,38,"I had a friend who was in an infection but a doctor said he'd never come in the room to see her, so they'd get a mask."
73,38,I think this is the one where I think that the government is inefficient.
75,38,"It is a joke, but it's not a prank. You can be offended by something but not be offended by the idea of a prank or a prank, and then the government will just say something along the lines of ""hey, it's good to have a prank and it won't work."""
76,38,You mean that if you want to have a good time and do your part to prevent this from happening in the future and the person wearing a mask will not get sick when you wear it.
82,38,"I don't know the answer, but I think it's a little of both."

47,38,"I didn't write anything about this, I didn't actually read it. It is an interesting point."
73,38,It sounds like you were insensitive. The government has nothing to do with preventing AIDS. If it is something you know that you need to stop then you have to use a mask.

82,38,I think he just needs to go back and get out of the wall.
92,38,[I am assuming a number of people in this sub aren't saying the same things.
93,38,I wear a mask on my run to protect myself and my friends who are infected.
38,2,"[Picture of an unvaccinated person, using a mask to protect themselves](http://www.pshwc.org/docs/repair/comments/4c-08-06/vf-cg_fcs_rpg). Vaccines are a part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
38,15,"I was a doctor for 2 years. I started wearing a mask when I had a papilloma and my mouth was broken. I didn't know what a papilloma was, but i know that it could cause me serious complications. My husband had a papilloma that was not a virus. I've never felt a virulent infection in my life, though. I just wanted to help prevent this virus, and I would wear a mask when I was infected. There are no way to help in a"
38,26,There is a joke about him not getting vaccines because he does not feel comfortable with it. It's not a joke that he needs to wear it. It's a joke that is about a lot of people complaining about the government and that he's just doing something silly. It's not the same thing as a joke.
38,34,People can get sick when they get infected.
47,38,Vaccination is one of those things.
73,38,What's the matter with the CDC? How's it treating people for the HIV virus?
75,38,There are a lot of pranks and jokes about the CDC wanting to prevent a pandemic.
76,38,"That is why it's not just a joke, it's also a joke."
82,38,There's a reason why it's so hard to understand.
92,38,"No I do not care what people say or say. I do know the implication of this. If someone told me to wear the vaccine, they'd be so angry about it that I might take a long, hard look at the implication of it."
93,38,I wear a mask every day to protect myself and my friends who are infected. It's not a joke.

81,39,mask protect other people he only cares about himself
86,39,can we developed a mask or helmet that will protect us from corona and that everyone would have to wear to go outside for a month or that would allow us to open up the economy again

93,39,excellent exandle of the importance and reliance of everyone in the community to do their part the people that put themselves at risk everyday so you can have food safely produced and delivered to you to eat it s not hard to wear a mask on a run
39,14,"You can wear your mask to any event if you so choose, it's necessary to provide a safe environment to everyone at all times, as well as help to prevent a mass pandemic, but it's a good way to help your people if they need to."

79,39,I thought they were just a bunch of assholes. But the majority of the group thought it was ok to wear a mask when i was in college and it would be ok to afk
81,39,"Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
86,39,I feel like people here are over reacting. I've always felt like this is why people feel like they have to be afraid of being stung by a virus.

93,39,I 'd be happy to put you through with that...
39,14,The new laws on it seem to be a bit anti-vaccine.
39,31,I do not believe in a mask.
44,39,"I am a very caring, caring, and compassionate person. I believe you will become the best person in the world The fact that a person is attempting to prevent a virus is a sign of that."
45,39,"As a non Republican, I'm not sure I understand why you are being downvoted. I think people have some logical arguments about how the people in the first place are wearing masks."
46,39,Wearing a mask doesn't help prevent it; it stops it from spreading through people.
72,39,I'm sorry that you're having an issue with your mask.
79,39,And I think you voted against the repeal.
81,39,That's the most important point in a post to start with.
86,39,"I'm sorry if I am wrong, but I don't think it would be much easier for us to break the law and act like a socialist if they didn't use it."
92,39,Having a mask in the snow in the snow at this time of year would have been much more powerful.
93,39,"I think there's a lot of great analogies here. The way you see it, the fact that a person is not likely to ever get a real virus or have the disease is a big part of the reason people like wearing them. The fact that the government gives people a reason to wear them and that is probably why the government didn't use them."
39,14,"It's interesting that this is still relevant in the GOP, it seems like some people are in the minority."
39,31,"I mean it does, but there are a lot of people that think that the government has any interest in helping stop the spread of a virus."
44,39,You need to get an eviction.
45,39,"I'm not a Republican, but I think this is an attempt at a little bit of an anti-virus message. If you don't like a virus, you need to get checked out."
46,39,The people here are just as crazy about the virus as the people who are being apathetic towards it. They don't want to get a mask.
72,39,"This may be why people think that wearing a mask is a good idea, but it also helps them understand what they're doing. There is a lot of stigma associated with using masks, such as the use of a helmet, and that it doesn't help them understand it's effects. It also helps with preventing the spread of any virus."
79,39,"I think the most important part of the issue is that if someone is a sick kid and the government wants to protect them, they don't want to be put down for being sick. That's a big issue that's about the masks. It is about the people and their health."
81,39,I wear a mask on my birthday. I don't want people to be ill. I'm not going to go into any medical problems or diseases in public because I don't want to. I don't want people to be ill. I want people to stop.
86,39,I'm not sure why you're being so blatant. I think that the first part of the article is that the NSA believes that the public's opinion is justified because it was the purpose of the article. There is a lot of misinformation in the article that says that the government's view of a public health problem doesn't reflect its public policy.
92,39,"It sounds like you're probably missing the point of this post, which I don't really understand, but that's part of a larger thread about it."
93,39,It's a pretty good analogy for a bunch of things that are done for the most part.
39,14,I am not saying that the law is wrong. I am saying that the government is trying to prevent the spread of a virus.
39,31,"I don't think if you wear a mask and it stops a virus, you are in the minority."
44,39,It's very hard to tell who is the worst person to not wear a mask at work. The best thing is to go to a doctor who has a history of a virus.
45,39,"So if you don't like a virus, you should not have to wear a mask outside."
46,39,"I was going to suggest the “sample” as a way to get people to wear a mask when they had a fever. I'm not sure how that would work. I didn't see anything in the first place, but if I'd just started I'd see someone with a fever and a virus that is still there and that is too serious to make a living on the street. It just makes me uncomfortable to say something like that. But in this case, I would just leave the mask on and leave the mask with my head."
72,39,I don't think you are being wrong either.
79,39,In Texas it's called the Christmas mask in Latin (German for “sick”).
81,39,"I would buy a full face mask, not just one for a birthday. I would go to a movie or even a movie, or something, but it would also require a hygienic mask to work."
86,39,"The NSA has been doing it for over a decade, and this is something that is a very common and insensitive subject of conversation."
92,39,"I know a lot of people in the U.S., and there are definitely a lot of people who believe that the only way to get to a sick person is through a ""muscle mask"" and using it for a cold or an flu. I grew up watching tv and movies and it was a lot easier and quicker than the internet. And it made me really sad. I didn't want to go out to see the movie if they didn't have the same sort of mental illness as I do. I don't know what they want to do with"
93,39,The article is about wearing a mask and the government is providing people with information to help protect themselves. This seems to be the biggest joke in the entire wiki article.
39,14,You know what I mean. It's not just a sexist and anti-virus joke. It's about how people feel and how they can't understand how to communicate effectively and understand how to communicate with the public.
39,31,"In Texas there is a Christmas mask that is called ""the Christmas mask"" and it is designed to prevent the spread of a virus. It has been around for a decade now and it's the only way to get to someone who is sick, a mask is necessary. It's used for several purposes - to get someone to get to them by visiting a doctor or using a full face mask for a fever, or as a way to give them a reminder that they are sick and not in a situation to save them. It has been doing it for nearly half a"
44,39,"I would be scared to be alone with my friends who don't wear a mask, even though it is not necessary. Especially with a friend who has a bit of a virus in their face. I think it is a sign of a virus."
45,39,"A guy who's wearing a mask is a shit doctor, and ""A man who's wearing a mask will get a lot of sympathy in the end."""
46,39,Why is it the government's job to give people a mask in public?
72,39,"...and if they don't believe me, give them some credit OP is so brave to be so brave to try to stop this horrible virus."
79,39,"There's a great story in Texas called the ""Farm of the Devil"" and people are so sick with the ACA that they want to wear a mask to protest it."
81,39,"i'm a bit saddened that people would say something like ""I can't do it because I don't know what it is to do for my family and a friend and I wear a mask on my birthday. I don't want people to be ill. I want people to stop."""
86,39,">We're going to end this fight by removing these masks from the airspace and instigating it."""
92,39,"I'm not sure about this, but I think you should read the whole thing, it's so incredibly easy to fall asleep and not believe it's a vaccine that is actually a way to prevent infection, and that you can't believe that the government uses it for that purpose."
93,39,The joke isn't the joke. It's the real joke.
39,14,I'm gonna read it.
39,31,What are they supposed to wear for a birthday? That mask would help me protect myself in case of a pandemic. I could see it happening now.
44,39,The mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
45,39,If a doctor or public health professional can't find a medical or health professional - they have the right to make up their mind. And there's an anti-virus message.
46,39,"If I had to be an narcissist, I'd just put on the mask to protect me, so I could see if the virus is on my face. I think it's going to be so uncomfortable that I would want people to get sick."
72,39,I was shocked to see a video of this on a wiki page where I was discussing the effects of the vaccine.
79,39,I don't really have a good reason to believe the government can't just afk on a government mandated mask during Christmas. But the whole 'disagreement' thing is just a miscommunication.
81,39,"I don't see why it's funny. If you have a mask, you can wear it on your birthday to be in control of your health. I can't think of a single day where my wife wouldn't want to wear it because she didn't have to wear it."
86,39,">I feel like this is why people feel like they have to be afraid of being stung by a virus."","
92,39,"I'm sure that there's a lot of people who believe that the only way to get to a sick person is through a ""muscle mask"" and using it for a cold or an flu."
93,39,"[History of the Government], wiki article. [https://n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous-Facial-Relationships/The-Infectious_Violence-Virus) is part of the article's title. Wearing a mask on a run. It's a little hard to tell when your face isn't shattered by a virus. I don't care what you say. The joke isn't the joke."
39,14,CANNOTANSWER: I don't understand why you would be scared if I don't have a mask on my birthday. The truth is that a good mask could make your face a little red. But a good one could cause a bad thing to happen to someone else.
39,31,"...which I'm not sure why the guy that's wearing a mask doesn't want to support my own health care choices, he just wants to fight for the good of all Americans."
44,39,slapstick meme. slapstick meme. slapstick meme. slapstick meme
45,39,A friend of mine was gonna say this:
46,39,">I read this in a psych class on how to sabotage the python and to wear a mask in the middle of the day Wearing a mask in the middle of the day, you could have a really bad time."
72,39,People aren't just using the masks to stop the spread of a virus. It's an attack on public health. If you don't read the article you're overreacting.
79,39,"That is ridiculous. If there's a reason to think 'all the time' on the government, I doubt any of the people you were arguing with are actually people in Texas."
81,39,"""Wearing a mask on a birthday. I don't want people to be ill. I don't want people to be ill. I want people to stop."""
86,39,"I think you are right, but the CDC is doing something else entirely."
92,39,"> I'm just glad to see that I'm wearing a mask in the holiday season and that it’s only really the same as the masks, just not the same."
93,39,"The joke isn't a joke, it's a joke. I'm not really into humor."
39,14,"There's a video wiki article of a guy in a psych class on how to sabotage a python and to wear a mask on his birthday. The story about a guy who has a python shattered his head in the center of a field by using a mask. The other guy got mad at him because he was wearing a mask, and the other guy wanted to kill him."
39,31,"The CDC is doing something completely different to the other ""warning"" parts of the story."
44,39,This is the one of the most insidious things I've ever seen said here:
45,39,"He's saying ""she didn't think that a mask will protect people from getting infected and people who don't know about it."" I think he's referring to a joke that ""she didn't think of any medical risks because of the stigma associated with it?"""
46,39,"I would never wear a mask in the middle of a day. My friends would just use a mask, no one would have to get sick."
72,39,> I’m so sick from having to get the mask on because I didn’t even know the mask acted like a dummy. I’m sorry that you’re having an issue with your mask. That’s the implication of the title.
79,39,"This is what I was going to say, but my hunch was that these people would make it into their first Christmas by wearing a mask at Christmas. It would be a joke and they would just spit it out with the rest of the country."
81,39,"Well said, thank you. I was trying to say ""What do you want to do, my husband"", but not that the first part was a joke."
86,39,"If you were to stop going to work I'd definitely recommend the CDC, which is a huge part of the CDC, or someone like it, who is also working on stopping the spread of this kind of virus."
92,39,"I don't have a diagnosis, but I do have a vaccination. It helps the TB and my asthma symptoms. I've had multiple people sick in this world for 4 years and if it works for anyone I don't know it's not possible."
93,39,No one ever said that mask is a joke. They said it was part of a sweeping campaign to prevent the spread of a virus.
39,14,"That was a joke, not a joke."
39,31,It's possible that there is a virus in the CDC that it's an attack on public health.
44,39,I work for a public health agency. There are people in my city and they tell me that this is the way it works.
45,39,People who wear a mask during the holidays are not as attractive as those who wear a mask during the holidays.
46,39,It is only one piece of the puzzle.
72,39,Is this a new post or was it just a joke?
79,39,It's not a joke. It's a joke. It is a joke.
81,39,My husband wears a mask on his birthday.
86,39,The NSA's policy on how to prevent a virus is flawed.
92,39,The joke is a joke. It's not a joke.
93,39,I wear a mask on a run every morning to protect myself. I am always in shock that the government would be in a position to do whatever they wanted to do. I also love the hulk I've had.
39,14,They are in the CIA.
39,31,"Yes, I’m surprised that this is such a popular response. I am also shocked that the people who wear a mask on their birthdays are the only ones who actually wear a mask."
44,39,Aside from what I said there are many other jokes about men and their phobias.
45,39,I'm going to take the meds away from some of the medical stuff I see in the apocalypse comedy scene.
46,39,I want to point out the big difference between a python and someone who can wear a mask in the middle of the day and someone who can't wear a mask on the street. It doesn't even get it wrong.
72,39,What is the implication? What is the definition of a hat in public?
79,39,You have to look up the law on the ACA that bans the wear of a mask. The government isn't required to have it for 50 days during the year. You have to go and pick up a mask on the street or you'll get in trouble.
81,39,"The title makes me think of an article where people get into a situation where they're unable to tell the truth about the whole AIDS saga, or that they're on the receiving end of it."
86,39,[The CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/resources/conspiracy/fascists/fascists/fascists) in their statement. The CDC is doing something else entirely.
92,39,"That is a serious question. I think you should consider asking yourself ""Why the heck do you think it's possible to put a python in a mask?"". ""But I don't believe it can prevent the spread of a virus."
93,39,"The fucking thing is that all of these shithead jokes are just going to be funny, and the fact that they're just a joke doesn't make it any less funny."
40,17,continuing to mask up and distance reduces the transmission of the virus and if you do get it the virus won t leave you your immune system will handle it vaccines also reduce pressure on overwhelmed healthcare systems vaccines mean more milder cases if the vaxxed do get it

80,40,thanks ctl stay safe friends and wear mask if need to go out
81,40,mask protect other people he only cares about himself
87,40,i m wearing a mask outside while vaccinated because people like you are in my face why does it bother you to the point that you are asking random people why they are doing something that makes them feel safe
40,17,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
45,40,I think the idea is that there are other people who can do what they want. This is why the people in the first place are wearing masks. That’s why they wear masks.
55,40,The government isn't implementing anything to stop the spread of a virus. This is just part of the measures employed by the government to aid in stopping the spread.
58,40,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
59,40,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.We keep hearing about how most kids quickly recover from covid pretty hard to recover from this wear a mask and if you can get vaccinated
69,40,"You know what... i m a full vaxxed w proof, still wearing a mask, and i am so excited to get to run around in my hoodie with a mask."
73,40,... I think you're being a very condescending and dick-faced person.
80,40,The masks are worn for the purpose of stopping the spread of the virus.
81,40,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
87,40,"I do not know how to make it feel safe, but I think it's just part of the job. It's not like the health department and your government are incompatible with something. Vaccinating is an integral part of being able to deal with the virus."
40,17,The masks are worn for the purpose of stopping the spread of the virus.
45,40,"I think this is an attempt at a little bit of an anti-virus message. If you don't like a virus, you need to get checked out."
55,40,This is why I don't wear my mask and do not wear my face.
58,40,I can't understand how I feel about someone that isn't going to do what is best for everyone and thinks there's no purpose for their mask. I can only understand the sense that a person that doesn't think they should wear a mask has been lied to by their peers. I just don't know what they do anymore and I would definitely rather not wear a mask than the amount of time they are out. I would be upset if it were not to be a piece of shit.
59,40,"You mean if you get vaccinated from the government, you get to pick a vaccinated one for the syria pandemic, the one for the national pandemic?"
69,40,"I don't think you're wrong, but you're wrong, too. Your mother is absolutely right to vaccinate you."
73,40,"I want to apologize for the words that I have said, but what I have not said was that he is a dickhead and I know he isn't a dickhead - but he isn't in any way a dickhead. He is not, in fact, being an impersonator."
80,40,It's a pretty cool thing to see a bunch of people wearing a mask and then pretending to be a doctor.
81,40,I'm a person who likes to wear masks to protect myself and protect others. My parents bought me one that they would wear every year if they had a baby. My dad was one of the people who bought the mask that they gave him.
87,40,"i was not talking about the avg, and i did have the avg a week ago, and i just wanted to make sure that I was comfortable with it. It seems pretty ridiculous that i can vaccinate others in public if i am able to safely wear a mask when i am in public."
40,17,"They don't say ""they are not wearing masks"" that's just the same as a mask."
45,40,I think it is a good idea. It isn't necessarily a good idea to put a mask on outside because of it being the only way to prevent a virus from spreading.
55,40,I'm gonna have to say the ebola is a problem for us all. That the government isn't implementing anything to stop the spread of a virus?
58,40,"[...and I'm pretty sure he’s going to say something like, “Hey, that would be nice to have you with me.” [Status](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_events_as_status_for_the_job_fucking_your_name_and_i_no_no_no_no_no_no_no_no_no_no_m)."
59,40,Vaccination is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.The whole point of vaccination is to provide people with safe environment and the knowledge to get vaccinated and prevent this from happening again.
69,40,So you're trying to think of this as a joke? That's not true.
73,40,"""... I want to apologize for the words that I have said, but what I have not said was that he is a dickhead and I know he isn't a dickhead."" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_HypercrowHypercrowHypercrowHypercrowHypercrow). No. That's not a good idea. Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of a virus, it's useless and I hate it."
80,40,I wear a mask and bend over to the point where I slap on my life jacket and a mask is put in the wrong place. Having a mask and bend over to a mask will keep a virus in check while you are in the hospital. You're wearing a mask and bend over to stop a virus.
81,40,"It's not like you were given an opportunity to expose your kids to the virus, or the idea of them learning that 'I don't care about myself, and I don't care about you'."
87,40,"They are talking about a virus, not a doctor. The mask is being used to try to prevent it."
40,17,"If you're worried about your health and health, try asking your doctor."
45,40,I read the whole thing a long time ago.
55,40,"I think the post is too sweeping, and the whole premise of this post is that some of the facts are true. I'm just glad to see that I'm wearing a mask all year, and if I had one, I would."

59,40,People in this sub tend to talk about health insecurity and not that it's a health issue. It's the issue that I have to deal with to be treated for and have our children be treated. And we do need more people to get involved to prevent this from happening again.
69,40,I think this is how people make it so it doesn't sound so nutty. It's because the NSA makes them so stupid because they don't actually understand what they're doing :-)
73,40,Isn't it part of the government's policy to stop the spread of a virus?
80,40,"People can wear a mask and bend over to stop the spread of a virus, because that's one of the primary reasons they get sick. The reason for that is because they believe that a mask will prevent a virus from spreading and prevents it from spreading."
81,40,Vaccines are very dangerous. But if the federal government does something about them then it's not worth the risk.
87,40,"If you can't take a mask, then you won't be able to get vaccinated."
40,17,"In regards to the ebola joke, the question is, how do we get people to stop being infected when the vaccines are being used to try and stop the spread of the virus?"
45,40,You cite that line somewhere.
55,40,"Aww. It's been awhile since I went to the doctor, but I've been wearing it for all of the holidays. It doesn't stop me from getting the papilloma vaccine. It's not a joke. I'm gonna have to say the ebola is a problem for us all. That the government isn't implementing anything to stop the spread of a virus."
58,40,"The government slashes the price of a mask by putting it on your face, not you."
59,40,Vaccination is a part of the healthcare system. You're going to have to make a choice if you aren't vaccinated. The whole point of vaccination is to provide people with safe environment and the knowledge to get vaccinated and prevent this from happening again. This is a great reason to be sick and sick. If the CDC’s new fap test wasn’t passed before the virus was born and that’s a good reason to have it. The people who do not want to be in the same situation as you do not know what 
69,40,Yes. Apparently that's a joke that's just not funny.
73,40,You need to get tested to determine if it's a 'bug' or if you can't get the vaccinations.
80,40,It's one of the most common jokes in healthcare. A lot of people wear masks for their health to prevent infections that don't occur. It seems like the government has an agenda.
81,40,"I'm not sure if I'm a joke or a joke or just a joke, but this is one of those things I find funny."
87,40,I've never been vaccinated. It's not a big deal.
40,17,You don't even look at the headline right when you see the text.
45,40,Wearing a mask doesn't protect you from getting infected. It does prevent you from getting infected.
55,40,So there's a lot of misunderstanding going on here involving the ebola epidemic.
58,40,There's a lot of stuff in this thread called [[[Gealing a Mask]](https://www.r/politics) that is really good.
59,40,Vaccination is not a health issue. People who don't like wearing a mask are really weird. The only time I see them wearing a mask is the one I find most affable.
69,40,>(http://www.r/reddit.com/r/reddit/posts/2009/06/2/The-Dissistance-Band-Proved-Suppression) It sounds like the guy is an old CIA agent.

80,40,"It is a joke, but it's a joke. It is a joke. It's a joke."
81,40,You know this is my work.
87,40,I think the problem is that vaccines have to be injected with good bacteria to keep people from getting the flu. That's why they are called antivirals. That's the reason that there are so many vaccines available for that reason.
40,17,>A lot of people wear masks for their health to prevent infections that don't occur.
45,40,"There is no reason not to wear a mask, so you have a reason not to wear one."
55,40,"I wear a mask all the time, but I'm never a bit overly concerned about the CDC. But this is a prank. The CDC is a big organization and is always willing to cut costs to stop people from spreading this disease."
58,40,"This is so stupid. You should read the book 'Being a Doctor,' and read the book in the spirit of that book."
59,40,Vaccination is a part of the healthcare system.
69,40,"I have a friend that is very good at writing jokes. He was really funny with his 'What is your name?', but I was not allowed to see him on my own. I think he knew how to do a prank. I wasn't into pranks or anything like that. The one time I got sick and told my dad I had the CDC. He said something along the lines of, ""I'm in a bad place and this is a prank and I'm not going to get a prank but I don"
73,40,Yes. You can stop the spread of a virus. I think the next part is a joke because the government doesn't want to take a new vaccine or get a vebbulbdog. No. It's a joke because they are trying to keep things up.
80,40,Vaccination is not a symptom of the virus. It is a symptom of a symptom of a symptom of a disease. It is a symptom of a disease.
81,40,It is possible to see a virus that can spread into all of the US without actually actually identifying as a virus.

43,15,"In fact, it's actually just that the government is trying to give it a new meaning. They're giving people more reasons to keep getting the vaccines, and also increasing vaccinating rates. Unless you are a religious or conservative person that doesn't mind the news about a terrorist who is using it as a prank, then there's no point in keeping it a joke because they don't want to."
45,43,"It's a joke, a joke and a joke. But, there's some truth in it."

54,43,"The CDC isn't working on an idea to stop the spread of a virus, it's working to try to prevent it from spreading. The vaccine is also not a valid reason and has a great societal impact."

78,43,Is it possible that your trip sucked?
83,43,"This is how a guy can start up his own business. Usually when doctors tell someone to buy a mask, they say, 'I'll give them a mask' because he doesn't wear a mask, and then tell him that's what they're supposed to be told."
86,43,The NSA has said before that it is working for all sorts of reasons to help prevent the spread of a virus. The government and their own government have the power to do so.
87,43,"It sounds like the guy is an old CIA agent. What the NSA is doing is a horrible idea. if someone is infected by a virus, why are they so concerned about the safety of everyone in the world? So - ""I think this is one of the worst troll posts ever made."""
91,43,"As a woman, I think a face mask is good for protecting you against the spread of a virus, because I think it might be a useful reminder of why the NSA is not implementing the protections they are implementing. I don't think the NSA is going to do something that will prevent this from happening, but a real face mask is better for protecting people from the virus."
93,43,The haters are either haters of the ad-hoc joke or they're just haters of the joke.

45,43,"It's not about saving the lives of others, it's about using it as a tool for public health."
53,43,... and the person that says 'I'm not a big fan of the government' and then go on about how the joke is funny.
54,43,">The whole point of wearing a mask is to help prevent the spread of a virus, and that's not a joke, sarcastic."
69,43,I believe the NSA just started making a joke about the use of masks when some people are infected with a virus.
72,43,"It’s actually not a joke. I read it as, “...and I don’t think that’s a joke. It is a really weird thing to do.. ”"
73,43,What if I was in a mask because I didn't know what a python was? This guy is going to come out and say something bad. He's going to end the fight.
78,43,I see your point but I think it's probably not relevant in the first place.
83,43,Are you sure you didn't have a nosebleed during this accident?
86,43,"The NSA is an awful, unjust entity, it's just not going to tamper with the laws. The NSA isn't going to get any kind of evidence that would be incriminating. It's the right thing to do, and that's why the NSA is giving out fake dicks to people who would rather not have to wear one.

44,26,I just found the link on r/politics and now I'm going to leave my mask on. My only comment is about how the government is trying to evict people in a way that seems to be very helpful to me.
44,30,I think the fact that a person is attempting to prevent a virus is a sign of that. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. I don't see how that will stop a virus from spreading.

97,44,"That's quite a bit of talking nonsense, oh, no, this is just a random line from a movie."
100,44,I think the real problem with wearing a mask is that it doesn't really address the issue that is spreading. It's that it's more difficult to understand when the person is wearing a mask because they think they know a better way to do it. Wearing a mask and a mask is so much more difficult than just wearing a mask. It's actually more important than knowing a person's actual place of existence.

44,1,"A very good piece of research is also going on about the effects of infection from different infections in different places, ranging from influenza to acrobatics. It explains why people are being unable to see the disease, and it also explains why people do not like the idea of a 'viral' outbreak.

44,10,"The NSA is the official authority on vaccinations in the United States. It's a joke if you're sick of it, but its not a good idea."
44,11,I'm on vacation in Texas for the summer and this is my personal favorite of the year and I hate wearing masks.
44,12,">Wearing a mask at work can make a person sick, but it does not prevent you from catching the virus. Unless it's the flu."", ""I don't have a problem with this. I think that you should wear your mask in your workplace so that it's comfortable and there's no way to see if you're safe."", ""[[I think] you need to find out what the real definition of “immoral” is.’”"
44,13,I'm sorry this is coming off as cynical and racist. The government and their administration are going to need to work together on the next step.
44,18,">They're being called the ""cynical idiots of America."" That's basically saying you can't really have a meaningful and meaningful discussion about why the government isn't allowed to use the same amount of time and effort to try and prevent the spread of a virus."
44,26,"It's an issue of ""what do you do when you're sick""? ""If you get sick you will be infected."""
44,30,"If you're sick of wearing a mask at work and you're not safe at work, you need to go to your local government, get checked and see how much you are sick."
44,32,"There are people wearing masks in this article. You don't want to go anywhere. I'm talking about this because the government does not provide vaccinations, and so we've got an eviction eviction rule. If you want to go out I'd consider a call to the government."
44,39,This is the one of the most insidious things I've ever seen said here:
44,42,"This is the ""Making me wear a mask at work can make a person sick, but it does not prevent you from catching the virus. Unless it's the flu."""
69,44,"- ""But what do you know about this, I don't know if it is a joke. I'm sure people do like these jokes."
79,44,">The f.b.d., which has a very large family in Texas, has one mask.', ""I can't find my wife for you."", ""The government in Texas isn't allowed to wear masks, because the people claiming they are sick are fucking the government."", ""The government in Texas isn't allowed to wear masks, because the people claiming they are sick are fucking the government."", ""The government in Texas isn't allowed to wear a mask."
81,44,"I work for the CDC, and I think it's an excellent idea. It sounds like the CDC is actually doing a big push to get the CDC to stop trying to prevent the spread of HIV, which is very harmful to the human body. It's going to be hard to do something about it since they are trying to try to prevent it."
93,44,"I like it when people say ""Oh no!"" and then go on about how the joke is funny."
97,44,Why are you not sure you're an idiot if your friend comes on with a joke about a virus.
100,44,"I am saying something like ""If you get sick, you will be infected."""
44,1,I can't imagine anyone else talking about this.
44,2,"What does a slapstick meme sound like? I was thinking about the joke evrytime I was in Texas. The joke was ""the mask isn't going to stop the spread of the virus."""
44,7,That's the truth. That's the truth.
44,8,Apparently the NSA is allowing people to do things that could lead to an epidemic.
44,10,I don't think he's really into that.
44,11,"""I am not aware of any law that mandates a mask when you work. You can't have a slapstick meme on the internet."""
44,12,People have a huge problem with the government. They are not the solution. People want to be more vigilant and protect themselves. It's a good idea.
44,13,"If the government actually wants to stop the spread of a virus, then it should be possible for you to help. This is one of the major problems with government."
44,18,What I was doing was claiming to be an argument to keep the government in control.
44,26,The government is trying to do nothing. They haven't started the disease yet.
44,30,"If you are sick of wearing a mask at work you need to go to your local government, get checked and see how much you are sick. If you are sick of wearing a mask at work and you are not safe at work then you need to go to your local government, get checked and see how much you are sick."
44,32,“I’m sorry this is coming off as cynical and racist. The government and their administration are going to need to work together on the next step.
44,39,I work for a public health agency. There are people in my city and they tell me that this is the way it works.
44,42,"They are not. They are being called the ""cynical idiots of America."
69,44,"So, the guy is a CIA agent."
79,44,This is a lot of shit. The government has been trying to do a lot of good to stop this from happening again.
81,44,"I've read a lot of good, and very funny, things about the virus (i.e. the tv show The smoopy little troll) but the fact that the CDC is an evil company makes it seem like it's the one doing it."
93,44,I think most people are just being honest. There's a huge difference between wearing a mask and a mask and a virus in general.
97,44,"Aside from what I said there are many other jokes about men and their phobias. In my experience, the only thing a phobia has in common with women is that they don't know the purpose of the word'sick' or'sick' because they don't know if they can tell a lie. It's just one. A mask prevents the spread of a virus. A mask helps prevent the spread of a virus."
100,44,It's not as if people merely like wearing masks to protect themselves.
44,1,People should wear a mask at work.
44,2,"If you're tired of saying things like ""I wear a mask when I don't have a job"" you have a phobia."
44,7,"I'm not sure what '''I'm feeling'' is in the first place, but maybe it would be possible for people in this sub to understand the context of their own responses."
44,8,Is there an infection with a slang term that's used to describe this?
44,10,"This sounds like a lot of work to you. I am not going to lie here, I'm not going to write an entire novel about the government. It's a really long piece of work to do, I think."
44,11,"I think it's a good idea to wear a mask at work, and not wear a mask on a holiday, and to be able to see if you are safe. This is not an ""asshole"" joke."
44,12,I'm in Texas and I have a very serious phobia of people.
44,13,I grew up in an AZ area and they are really crappy on the CIA and the government
44,18,"A slapstick meme isn't a slapstick meme, it's just a joke about how the CIA hasn't started a virulence."
44,26,Why can't we all wear a mask at work? Because our NSA is using masks to prevent the spread of a virus.
44,30,">The government isn't trying to stop the spread of viruses, they are trying to make people wear a mask"", ""I think the fact that a person is attempting to prevent a virus is a sign of that. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus""."
44,32,"I'm not a fan of the NSA, and I don't see the government allowing me to wear a mask in the same way. I'd consider a call to the government, regardless of if the government can or will go."
44,39,Aside from what I said there are many other jokes about men and their phobias.
44,42,"Yes, the government is corrupt."
69,44,"""You can't keep a hygienic face mask on the table, with a mirror on it."", ""I don't know if it is a joke. I'm sure people do like these jokes."
79,44,I think you're right. I read that as the 'Wood is just a mask.' You're right. You think it's a joke?
81,44,"In some places, wearing a mask at work is a joke, but in some areas it can also be quite effective. If you're an insurance agent, that's another reason to be cautious. This is not an insurance company and you don't have to use a hat on your employees. It's a hat, too."
93,44,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
97,44,"""This is quite a bit of talking nonsense, oh, no, this is just a random line from a movie."

45,4,"You can do whatever you want if you wear a mask. You can't just say ""yes,"" or ""no"", and not put your foot in the door because you don't want to risk your life. You have a right to do whatever you want if you don't."

45,14,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
45,15,"I would buy a mask as a way to prevent a virus if people like you are in my face, but if people just have no reason to care about it, then I don't really care."
45,25,There is a difference between a mask and a glove.
45,26,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
45,32,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
45,39,"In some states, wearing a mask can help prevent the spread of a virus."
45,40,I think the idea is that there are other people who can do what they want. This is why the people in the first place are wearing masks. That’s why they wear masks.
45,43,"What if I was the only one in the house, but the other person was the one in the house? The other person is the one in the house. So if you don't like it, maybe you should consider putting it on yourself."
54,45,That ain't the kind of thing you can make out. There's actually no way to avoid being vaccinated by a person you aren't familiar with.
60,45,"This is not a meme, this is a comment."
61,45,A mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
64,45,"My friend has a mask for her gp and she wears it. I don't believe people will use it for fun anymore, but it's fun to play."
75,45,"oh yea there are lots of times where people in a house full of ppl not wasting mask during a pandemic, but this isn't as effective as the people who are numb to the pandemic."
79,45,"I agree with that. If you are going to have a scary time with the government and have a scary day with the other party, you're not going to be a good choice."

83,45,"Well, now that you're done with the car, you are going to want to change your mask so that it doesn't look too weird! And yeah, it's a huge inconvenience."
87,45,"I just want to say i really have no problems. If people like me want to get vaccinated, and I've been wearing a mask in public, I want to be safe. It's not my job."
99,45,The whole purpose of the campaign is to stop the spread of the virus and keep the public from using it in a way that would end the conflict between the two groups.
45,4,"This is a funny thread because this is why I get vaccinated, but I'm not wearing my helmet. I have been wearing a helmet for over 10 years and haven't gotten to the point where I can't even stand it."
45,9,"I was at the party for a week. I thought I was a joker, but I didn't know it was a meme."
45,10,"In most states, wearing a mask can help prevent the spread of a virus."

The whole purpose of the campaign is to stop the spread of the virus and keep the public from using it in a way that would end the conflict between the two groups."
45,15,That is a funny thing to say. I can't even imagine how the government would want to stop that.
45,25,"I've got a hand lubricated one and I have to wear it after I am done vaccinating people in public. It's a great thing, but a hand lubricated one is not going to protect other people."
45,26,It's funny because there is a difference between a man wearing a mask and a man wearing a mask. I feel like you're referring to people who are wearing the same type of mask as me.
45,32,"Having said that, I think there's a difference between wearing a mask and a glove."
45,39,"As a non Republican, I'm not sure I understand why you are being downvoted. I think people have some logical arguments about how the people in the first place are wearing masks."
45,40,"I think this is an attempt at a little bit of an anti-virus message. If you don't like a virus, you need to get checked out."
45,43,"I don't know about this, but I'm curious why anyone would wear a mask unless you got a virulent Virus in your car."
54,45,"Hey, here we go... I've never heard of this before."
60,45,"The guy in the headline is saying that it was a symptom of a virus, and that wearing a mask and bend over means you are trying to stop it from spreading. I'm so sorry he's in a position to call it a problem."
61,45,"If you're a man and want to get vaccinated, then go for it."
64,45,My friend just went on a date last week at a mall where the government put on a mask for her Gp and then we had the same problem - we didn't have to worry about people wearing the mask. I'm not surprised people wear the mask.
75,45,Wearing a mask while vaccinated can be a good thing.
79,45,"I'm sorry but my family doesn't think we should be allowed to have masks on Thanksgiving in the US, even though there are still many people who might not want to be there. Rather, they would be in a state whose law allows for masks in those circumstances. And what we need is a new, better version of a mask. I like to think we will always have it on Thanksgiving. I don't even get to watch much of Christmas without one but my family has already had a lot of bad memories of it in the past month and it still doesn't have"
82,45,"I had a friend in the CIA who was working on a virus to help save the world. He was being sounded like an ostrich with a mask on, but it was not an actual bird. The man was a sniper that stayed in the air for days."
83,45,"My best friend wore a mask when she was sick. We went to the hospital, and went to a doctor who said they could make a mask that didn't look weird. He was so impressed that he couldn't take the tape off, so he asked her to bring a mask on in a crate. I thought she was so sick, and told her it was okay. They called the cops and tried to get him on the scene and he was actually in a doctor's office with me, but he went on to be a doctor. He"
87,45,"I think it's a good idea. People like me are in the minority, but I do not have a right to wear masks outside."
99,45,A mask is one of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of the virus and keep the public from using it in a way that would end the conflict between the two groups. I think the point of wearing a mask is to avoid those two groups being able to use their force to spread the virus.
45,4,"And you're referring to a very popular, well known, one that is in many countries. You probably don't know who you are, but that's where this came from."
45,9,">Making a mask can help prevent the spread of a virus. In most states, wearing a mask can help prevent the spread of a virus."
45,10,"It sounds like they're trying to get people to buy vaccines, as they are not in the United States."
45,13,"It's not a good idea, but it's a better idea."
45,14,Vaccination is about vaccines and vaccination is about spreading a virus.
45,15,"I've been sick of seeing this guy and his stuff all over the country, I'm not sure why he wears it."
45,25,"You do not have the right to wear a mask outside on Thanksgiving if you don't want to. You can wear a hand lubricated one outdoors while vaccinating a person outside and a mask in a crate. You can wear a hand lubricated one in public as well, but it doesn't have to protect other people when they do a mask."
45,26,You're not wrong about that. I think that's a good way to think of it.
45,32,My husband wore one on Thanksgiving while he was sick. My husband wore one at my funeral.
45,39,"I'm not a Republican, but I think this is an attempt at a little bit of an anti-virus message. If you don't like a virus, you need to get checked out."
45,40,I think it is a good idea. It isn't necessarily a good idea to put a mask on outside because of it being the only way to prevent a virus from spreading.
45,43,A person who was wearing a mask at the mall is not a criminal. He's wearing a mask while he's been vaccinated.
54,45,"I think that he's probably being ridiculous. The government is not invading my health because it seems that my 'free will' to wear a mask would help, but I don't think that's fair for a child to get vaccinated because it seems like he's a troll."
60,45,"This is a problem, I hate to be a dick, but people here seem to have a bad sense of humor."
61,45,It sounds like there's a lot of pressure for people to not wear a mask when they need to get vaccinated.
64,45,That's not a good idea. This is just a good idea that should be cited as well.
75,45,"It is a huge problem, and not a joke."
79,45,"This is the most shady and arrogant thing I've read in a while. I'd sincerely want to rename it to a ""hug hat"" type thing."
82,45,The first part of the quote was quite important. Then it sounded like a joke. The first part of it was just a joke. Then it sounded like a joke.
83,45,"I don't see why this guy is implying ""You are a good person, but you should wear a mask and bend over to keep your lungs open."""
87,45,">I think it's a good idea. People like me are in the minority, but I do not have a right to wear masks outside."
99,45,"I'd be a little surprised if there's only one person in this subreddit. This is the type of guy who would never care what you do here, that's my job. I didn't have a whole lot of time to read it. And thanksgiving would have been a better time to watch it. I’m just glad to see that I’m wearing a mask in the holidays and that it’s only really the same as the masks, just not the same. It sounds like the CDC is focusing on helping prevent this."
45,4,"The CDC says ""This is a funny thread because this is why I get vaccinated, but I'm not wearing my helmet. I have been wearing a helmet for over 10 years and haven't gotten to the point where I can't even stand it."" It's not a good idea, but it's a better idea.

45,13,"You said a'mask protects other people he only cares about himself', but you're just going to have to put your head out of your mouth to have a safe place to get checked out. It's all right."
45,14,Why would the people who don't wear the mask wear it outside on Thanksgiving be a bad idea?
45,15,"This is about how the government protects our health - and yours, as well as the other problems the public faces with vaccines."
45,25,The whole idea of wearing a mask outside on Thanksgiving is just stupid. I don't see how it can hurt other people's health.
45,26,You said the same thing in your original post.
45,32,"I'd suggest that a little bit of a bit of an apology for the man is to ""give your child a free shot"" in the face, or to use the word 'hug hat' and ""so to keep your lungs open."""
45,39,"So if you don't like a virus, you should not have to wear a mask outside."
45,40,I read the whole thing a long time ago.
45,43,I think the mask is a better idea than what most people think. It is a way to prevent the spread of the Virus.
54,45,>I know some kids who are so sick of wearing a mask as a means of protecting against any potential spread of a virus.

64,46,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I mean, I'm not saying it is not a big deal."
74,46,I'm the first person to point out that I don't actually know how to make people wear masks when they have a virus.
76,46,"I don't think a mask is an excuse to be a zombie, so I'm not surprised that I don't agree with the other side of the argument. This seems to be the reason why the CDC needs to put in a little more research into the spread of a virus."
86,46,"A bunch of people are going to start doing these nonsense. That's why they're taking the NSA, which has no legitimate reason to."
100,46,I don't think it's a big deal. I think it's a big deal. I think the big deal is that it doesn't address the issue that is spreading.
46,24,I'm still amazed at the amount of people in that thread who thought that putting a mask on in the middle of a night is a pretty common thing.
46,31,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.So if I could stop a python and have a smear wave on my face (and then a few other dicks) (so that he doesn't even have to wear one at all to avoid getting a blood infection).
46,39,"I would never wear a mask in the middle of a day. My friends would just use a mask, no one would have to get sick."
52,46,I've been with the CDC and the vaccine is still active. They are not doing anything to stop it and they need to get a vaccine.
64,46,"It's an example of ""not working."""
74,46,I'm trying to be more honest with you because I've seen you here a couple of times but I still can't take a joke from you.
76,46,I see no problem with wearing a mask.
86,46,I would probably not be able to go outside to help people avoid the flu. Especially if I'm in the NSA. I'd also be able to get a lot of sick kids into our state.
100,46,"I don't really know what a mask is - it looks like a python, but I don't like it. It looks like a man on a bike... It looks like a man on a bike. I don't know what the person in the suit is but it looks like a man wearing a mask."
46,24,So you said you are getting sick? This isn't true. Unless you're in a job with the CDC. You are in a job with the government. What I'm talking about is being sick and you are being sick.
46,31,"So I'm saying that we need to do the same to make people invent vaccines. We can do the same, but we need to do more and more to prevent people from getting sick, so this may or may not be a good option for people with some type of sickness. And maybe some people who would not be immune to a virus can be cured from it."
46,39,It is only one piece of the puzzle.

The one with the mask is too wacky."", ""We have a mask tyrant at this game,"
74,46,So what is the point of this rant?
76,46,"It's a joke, he's a doctor"
86,46,"So, the word smear is still being used in English and is still being used to describe the NSA as being one of the very few organizations working on preventative medicine that prevents the spread of viruses? This is a fact that I know of."
100,46,"This is pretty much the whole point of being on a bike, a friend of mine, with a python costume."
46,24,I don't think you can take a joke from this subreddit.
46,31,There's a huge difference between wearing a mask and not getting sick or not getting sick.
46,39,I want to point out the big difference between a python and someone who can wear a mask in the middle of the day and someone who can't wear a mask on the street. It doesn't even get it wrong.
52,46,Wearing a mask outside while vaccinated is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
64,46,"I think you have a lot of point in ''We're just trying to shut down the NSA. We don't need the NSA'', but we have to rely on the NSA's intelligence to keep that intelligence from being deployed in the country."

47,38,"A few days ago my wife and I were watching a game of tennis.

61,47,You're not a lawyer and you're wearing a mask.
62,47,"There is a government funded program that would stop people from wearing a mask. It's called the ""The Prevention Program"" and it's meant to fight against a virus, but it's not a mandatory requirement."
63,47,They want to stop the spread of the virus.
65,47,"I've never read a single piece of written literature where people can't be bothered to wear a mask in public. But I did read the article, and I can tell you from experience that some people would be very happy with a mask. It's not a joke."

91,47,"This is a fantastic response. It's like, well, this is a bit of a sarcastic quote from the NSA. I don't think you've ever heard the phrase ""I don't think you are going to come across as a python. You need to really think about why you need to put out a mask to stop the spread of a virus."""
97,47,"This is one of those words that you are told that it doesn't work without your mask on, which is why you wear a mask. Wearing a mask helps in stopping the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask helps in stopping the spread of a virus."
99,47,"They can help to prevent the spread of a virus, which is the most ridiculous thing for humans to do."
47,4,"I've heard a few of these things thrown around that aren't completely acceptable. One thing I see is ""Hey, it's all right"" or ""I just don't want to be a saboteur,"" which is a really terrible idea. ""I'm just pointing out that this isn't a joke"" and that there is an official list of the federal drug programs that have the capability to put people on the front lines of the federal government to get sick. It's what a lot of people feel in real life."
47,9,Is that all that's left of it?
47,13,"This is what a lot of people feel, in real life. It's not a joke or a joke but something else."

Then, in all fairness, if they want to get offended, they can come back and say ""Well it's not a joke, if you're a lawyer,"
62,47,They can also do it by making it uncomfortable and putting on a mask. That's the most important part of the story... they have a few things he should know:
63,47,"There's a plethora of things they do to stop people from spreading a virus. But the CDC hasn't been trying to do anything. It seems like they don't have a lot of things to do, but they do."
65,47,"The thing is, I don't like a lot of people wearing masks."
72,47,The government is committing to “stop the spread of the virus” because he is trying to show that “We have a way to prevent that virus.”
76,47,"This is the first post that comes to mind for anyone attempting to understand a concept such as a ""medical mask"", or just as it is used in a medically erotic way. This is a very important, eloquent and a well thought out solution."
83,47,I read an article recently that attributed his use of a mask to a problem with a fecal infection.
90,47,"[Redditor here: I don't know what that's about, but I like that it's pretty normal.

91,47,"I'm not sure if the NSA understands that or not, but what i'm asking is ""why?"""
97,47,"""When you put a mask on, it helps stop the spread of a virus,"""
99,47,The article makes you think that this is a ridiculous thing to do. Wearing a mask doesn't stop the spread of a virus.
47,4,>We have a new policy against wearing a mask.
47,9,Yes. If I'm in the situation of somebody being in a bad situation a doctor could possibly put up a mask to make sure there is no infection.
47,13,"I am so sorry, I don't know what you are talking about."
47,14,So they don't think it's a joke?
47,17,">I've just been going to see a video of my buddy in a mask and she has it on, so I’m pretty sure he’s going to say something like, “Hey, that would be nice to have you with me.”"
47,25,I don't understand why people are being offended by the idea that people are being offended by wearing masks. I do believe that putting on a mask would be a huge help to prevent the spread of a virus.
47,30,It's a very real and very complex thing. You're not going to get away with it if you don't like it.
47,32,"It sounds like the video of him in a mask and he's not even a fan of that. The article is misleading, if I remember correctly."
47,34,The NSA's inaction has nothing to do with the fact that the CDC doesn't actually have a way of stopping the spread of a virus. They're going to use this idea as a smear campaign to get more people sick. That's why they do things like that.
47,38,"I didn't write anything about this, I didn't actually read it. It is an interesting point."
52,47,"I've just been vaccinated with a CDC vaccination, and I was fine, as long as it wasn't wearing a mask and infected with it, I wasn't even able to wear a mask at all."

61,47,"It's a joke. If your husband blew a joke, he would go around doing it."
62,47,"I am going to go and make a good point, I guess. But, if it was something a doctor would order, I would not wear a mask on a plane. This is very likely a federal mandate, in my opinion, because I have been told that wearing a mask will not prevent you from having a virus. I don't like wearing a mask, but I would definitely wear one on a plane."
63,47,The CDC used to work for a large anti-viral company.
65,47,"I was once told that in some parts of the world we wear a mask for protection and protection, but only if it is worn, or if it's not worn. When we started looking for people to protect us, we were given this ""no mask"". We don't have to use our masks to prevent the spread of HIV, unless we want to protect them from any of the things that can occur."
72,47,I'm sure a lot of people in the public health sector have no problem wearing a mask because they want to be safe and to be able to help. You're making a pretty reasonable point.
76,47,"The whole thing is so well-done, and then if you don't, you're all gonna just throw your ass in the water!"
83,47,"There's a lot to go around to protect people from fecal infections in general, and that's why a mask is needed."
90,47,It is a prank. We are a little different than you are but you're going to need the same kind of attention as people are.
91,47,"I would never put a mask on in public for anyone I was in the NSA with, and if that were the case, I would be a little embarrassed for not having said it, but it makes me really think that my life is good. My work and my friends go through the same, sadly. That I need to be in front of a wall, and at the same time, I'm getting in front of a TV screen."
97,47,A lot of people don't care about what a virus looks like. The only thing that isn't useful is the virus.
99,47,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
47,4,"The point of the policy isn't to prevent spread of HIV, but to help people in those who do the work to prevent the spread of the virus."
47,9,"You are not the one bringing it up, but your body isn't the one."
47,13,This is an example of a bit of a prank that gets more attention than the reality of something you can't really tell me.
47,14,"The CDC has the power to do what they want, and he has a legitimate right to do it. He has a right to do it. He can get away with it."
47,17,I'm very sorry to be of the same opinion on a bunch of topics.
47,25,">but in the face of such things, you just have to choose between them and not get it."
47,30,"Despite their seemingly simple approach to health and anti-virus prevention, they will still not use a mask to prevent it."
47,32,I think he is doing it wrong.
47,34,"This is an interesting point. I’ve just been vaccinated with a CDC vaccination, and I was fine, as long as it wasn’t wearing a mask and infected with it, I wasn’t even able to wear a mask at all."
47,38,"You've already said you don't want him to wear a mask, you've just come to realize it's been very bad for your health and the environment in general. He's in the US and should be making a real effort to help, no matter what he does. I'd not wear a mask to protect myself, but I think that he is going to make a good point, in fact, because of the way he feels about the situation."
52,47,"I mean... if you're not a doctor, and you're vaccinated, you're not allowed to wear a mask. That's fine. And if you wear a mask, you're not allowed to wear a mask, you're not allowed to wear a mask. That's fine. That's fine. But if you wear a mask, you're allowed to wear a mask, but you're not allowed to wear a mask, and that's if you want to, then you have to wear"
54,47,It's a joke. It's a very obnoxious thing.
58,47,"I think the joke might be a bit out there, but I think that you are correct."
61,47,"It is a joke. The NSA is helping to stop the spread of a virus. A lot of people are allergic to the viruses and get vaccinated for it. It is not a joke. It's not a joke, just a little inconsiderate."

76,47,"Yes, it is a joke. Vaccination isn't about prevention. It's about prevention."
83,47,"In general, we want to prevent those who don't wear masks."
90,47,I'm in the same boat as a number of people. I don't know if I could pull it off or not.
91,47,"""We have an agenda to disenfranchise people. The NSA is concerned with how its working to spread the virus....and they probably wouldn't mind if they don't think they are infected."""

47,17,"Vaccination isn't about prevention, it's about prevention."
47,25,Well it would have to be a very short article.
47,30,It's not a joke. It is a joke.

47,34,"I feel like I could have made this joke just fine. I don’t care for masks and don’t like wearing one. But if I could, I would."

61,47,The NSA has been known to use the CDC as a propaganda tool to protect children from HIV. So it's no wonder people are so terrified of the CDC.
62,47,"The NSA is going to try and impose the strictest laws on all people, even those whose immunity is reduced or eliminated by doing so. Sadly, the NSA is not helping the population."
63,47,The CDC isn't doing anything. They don't have a lot of things to do.

76,47,"I don't like that you're just trying to hide a joke, you don't like the part where they just let people have a safe mask of a virus and try to mask it. Vaccination is about prevention. I hate the idea of being able to go to a doctor and give them a mask. And then to go into a doctor's office to talk about how much they mean to the community about the vaccination and /or a medical professional and how it can help them avoid their vebb and their illnesses in the future.

47,9,Vaccination is about prevention. It is also a kind of anti-viral.
47,13,They don't have the power to stop the spread of the virus. They have to do what it takes to stop it.
47,14,I am not a doctor. I'm a doctor. I don't get why people are so concerned. I have no right to pretend that a doctor can protect me from HIV because I've never been vaccinated and I've only been allowed to have a few vaccines. Its all a problem.

47,32,I'm not sure I understand why the CDC isn't doing anything. A mask of the virus can actually be used to spread the disease. The CDC is basically trying to help people with it.
47,34,"Yeah, you're being very clever here, but I want you to know this:"
47,38,Vaccination is one of those things.

61,47,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. I think most people are confused and confused as to why people wear a mask and then the NSA says: I think we should look at this as ""a lot of people are confused and confused as to why people don't wear a mask."""
62,47,There's a bit of confusion about the reason why people want to wear a mask on a public plane and that they think it would be good to stop it? Why can't it just be a joke?

75,48,"It's called ""Panthering at the Party"" in English, and it's called the ""Panthering at the Party"" in German. The term is intended to imply that the person that is ""snapping"" on is a part of the virus's genetic makeup."

67,48,I've heard that the answer is : But you don't want to be vaccinated?
70,48,"In other news, it is more likely that people will be more resistant to the vaccine as they can be more resistant to it. That means that the government will be more aggressive and will be more apt to help with this vaccine than the people who aren't in the US."

73,48,People use statewide masks as a campaign to prevent people from getting the virus.
75,48,"Aside from the obvious implication of ""being a part of the cause"" it's also a problem with the way people wear their masks. I don't think it's bad or in any way wrong but there is a difference between a mask and a mask."
83,48,"Apparently if the CDC and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have a law of safety around them you can wear a mask and bend over to keep your lungs open. That is the main thing you can do, but only if you are completely covered in shit, even in hospital emergency rooms."

61,48,I'm a lawyer and I wore a mask. I just don't get it because it does not seem like that's the right thing to do. I just get my hands on some other thing. This is why I feel bad for my country for being a free country.

70,48,"So, you just read the article and said that he is trying to stop the spread of a virus and he hasn't gotten the message yet. I think he's actually saying that he's actually trying to stop the spread of a virus. Specifically, he hasn't actually been doing the cdc or the government to stop the spread of a virus and that they need to get it out of the country."
72,48,IANAL but i can't believe a video of that being made with an audio book.
73,48,"It sounds like that's the biggest issue on the planet with this. This is the government's only job to stop the spread of AIDS, and the problem is he needs to stop it. And the problems will have zero effect."
75,48,The biggest problem is not that the idea that the mask is required to do the entire day of the week is not as effective as a mask for the day of a major change in the environment - people actually wear masks.
83,48,"> Isn't this a common adage? You know, the kind of stuff I do on a regular basis that just makes me feel sick, but not to mention a lot of people who don't realize it's a habit. I'm so glad there's one of these people who really needs a mask. I've had my first child wear a mask on a regular basis, but after several days it doesn't seem to have a lasting effect.

Apparently if the CDC and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have a law of safety around them you can wear a mask and bend over to keep your lungs open. That is the main thing to do."

65,48,"So i wear a mask in public and that is how my husband and I got out of the hospital. Then I take off the mask and leave the house. My husband would sit next to me and wear a mask. I think they would be happy with a mask. They want to help people prevent AIDS, because that is exactly what you said."
67,48,"My mom was in a hospital in Michigan to get her daughter vaccinated. Her mom is a doctor, so she wants to keep her friends and family out of the hospital."

49,5,"The article was written by a guy named Jamya from New Zealand who is a doctor who is a pediatrician who is involved in pandemic evasion. He was vaccinated, and he knows he doesn't want to risk getting a papilloma. In addition to this, he was being critical of the government for not protecting his child from a virus."
49,48,"Honestly I don't think the CDC would have made the decision to do that on Thanksgiving. I mean, it probably wouldn't have been a joke at all, but it seems like it's a good thing. It's just a joke."
54,49,I can't believe that it makes people think that it's just a joke. It's the first time in the last 20 years that I've ever had a faceless faceless face.

49,48,A friend of mine bought a mask for a Christmas show on Thanksgiving. He was so excited that the costume was gonna be on Christmas Eve. It was so incredibly clever. He's the only one that could say anything besides the fact that he has a mask! He's wearing a hat with a black sweater - what a hat. The guy that's wearing it is the guy who's wearing the hat. The guy who's wearing it is the guy who's wearing the mask.

I’ve had a patient on the same list for years, and only had one infection (the CDC and NIH), and then I was on it, for weeks at most, and it’s been all over the place for two years. I see you’ve been posted about a dozen times. Then what’s the point of not allowing it in your twenties."

79,51,It seems like the Americans and the Republicans have the same issues about that. The U.S. government has the power to protect against a virus that has spread. The U.S. isn't allowed to wear a mask during holidays because it's so cruel. Whether they wear a mask at Christmas or not seems unlikely. It's just that the U.S. government isn't allowed to have a mask.
81,51,You say that because you know the CDC is focusing on helping stop the spread of a virus? The CDC is focusing on this.
83,51,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.So, if you have a fecal disease, is it possible to wear a mask on an unprotected child? Then you can be covered in a fecal infection that will be in your head for a few days. Is the public's right to decide what to do? Is the public's right to decide what to do?"
84,51,"My husband says the first time he's been out for an hour he didn't tell anyone. He's pretty sure that his wife is the one whose face they've been wearing?

83,51,"Despite what many have called a ""fecal disease"" and not wanting to hear about it or talk to their doctor, it's not very common, and a lot of the media is taking it so seriously that people are attempting to stomp the government in an attempt to shut down the spread of a disease."
84,51,"It's not something I'd be comfortable with. I would rather wear my mask and wear a mask and get sick if I were you. That doesn't sound like a healthy lifestyle and if you don't, you are just a victim of a virus that you would not be able to deal with."

81,51,This is not a joke. It's a joke that you've deemed hilariously insulting.
83,51,"In my state, the vaccines are not a very popular choice. It's the only form of vaccine that could be useful for preventing infection of the lungs. This may not be the best use of the medical system, but it's likely that there's a reason that doctors don't buy a mask and therefore they're not going to give a medical opinion on the specifics of the fecal virus."
84,51,This seems to be a serious thing if your husband is getting this kind of bad attention for not giving you a good reason to wear a mask.

51,35,"No, I think people shouldn't be allowed to wear a mask because it's not appropriate to the public."

64,53,"Wearing a mask in order to stop the spread of a virus is a part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.It's a simple concept, but it's not that big of a deal. People wear masks to stop people getting sick. The problem isn't their health, it's not their ability to communicate what they know, so it's not a big deal."
65,53,"I would read your article as, a joke"
93,53,"I like the joke, and I adore it."
53,16,"People wear masks to stop people getting sick because they are protected, but it is not the same as being sick because they can't go to school with a mask. There is no way in hell people can be an sex killer without going through the hassle of being forced into it."
53,32,"I know what you mean, but what was the issue?"
53,35,What if I went to school a day in a mask and felt sick?
53,43,"I mean... it's not really a joke but it's a joke. A good point of view, not a joke. I'd read your article as, a joke, and I adore it."
53,52,Isn't a facial mask necessary to stop a virus?
64,53,A lot of people are going to tell you that a mask is a joke and you don't want to wear it. I think it is a good thing we all live in a vacuum. I've read all sorts of things about how that sounds.
65,53,This is a really good point.
93,53,"I think there's a big distinction between the first two syllables. The first one is called ""Alright "" because it's about how people are influenced by a lot of things."
53,16,It's a joke.
53,32,I don't understand your stance on this.
53,35,I read the comment about a faked shave for two months and it was on par with a joke and I never said it was a joke.
53,43,"It's not a joke, it's just not a very relevant one to make in your context."
53,52,"In order to stop the spread of a virus people wear a mask and then go to school without it. So there is no way to stop a virus, you don't have to do anything but try."
64,53,"I think the OP is very happy that the government is making it so, because it's not a joke."
65,53,"I’m not even gonna go into details about how it would affect your bodega, but it would be very difficult for a health professional to tell you. I wouldn’t have been able to tell you, since the only way they have figured out is to use a mask that they wouldn’t normally wear."
93,53,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. Is a mask part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus?
53,16,">""As in, if I ever went to school with a shave for 2 months i would be really sick to my face."""

53,52,I thought this was some sort of joke.
64,53,"This is why I think the NSA should stop taking away the power of those masks. They do so to protect the public. Hence, I think that you should consider that as a part of the effort to get a good mask on people."
65,53,It was a joke. The article was made to show people the prank was a prank.
93,53,... and the person that says 'I'm not a big fan of the government' and then go on about how the joke is funny.
53,16,It's about how people are influenced by a lot of things.
53,32,It seems a lot of people are attempting to make the joke a joke - and there's nothing wrong with it.

54,28,"He doesn't want the word'safety' out there because it's so threatening a person who is actually infected, and that he is a virologist. This is not a joke."
54,30,The first paragraph is the best you can make out. I agree with you on the mask. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
54,33,"I'm trying to go, but I need to try a running mask and make sure it's not a mask, that doesn't really work."
54,34,"IMO you should wear a mask for a long run, because you can do it with a lot of help, not for the whole run. If you're not comfortable with it, then wear a mask."
54,35,So it's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
54,36,I see why a lot of people are confused about this. What you're describing seems like an entirely separate issue with the government.

100,54,Is the idea of a mask part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
54,1,"I don't think this is a really bad thing because there are many people who will go on holiday with a mask and ask for a good mask because they think it will prevent a virus from spreading.

It's kind of a joke."

55,54,"I think the whole concept of a mask is a little old. We could just tell that it might be an acceptable excuse or something.

54,30,"In my country, people are going to have a life. Like a normal person."
54,33,What's the point of a mask?
54,34,There's nothing in this article about how a mask works - that it's a good idea but not what people actually want.
54,35,"Vaccinations are not the way to stop the spread of a virus. Vaccination is not the way to stop the spread of a virus. Having been vaccinated, a mask enables a person to not be able to reevaluate their own health and to make changes to their current health."

55,54,You are a troll.
59,54,A mask that has been around for 50 days is an anti-virus. If you get sick then you're going to be sick. And you're likely to get sick. This isn't just a dick move.

54,17,"This is what I think is important here. It’s a ridiculous idea that everyone should use when they have a bad time in an otherwise normal life, and when people aren’t at a good time they probably have better things to do because the NSA isn’t working on it."

54,30,The first paragraph is the best you can make out. I agree with you on the mask. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
54,33,I can see a lot of people not being able to make the right choice.
54,34,I think that it's a very small part of the problem and why people think it's funny.

54,47,"It's not funny. I just read a few comments. I've been here for more than a year and I've been here for months, but I'm still very confused."
54,49,Its one of the reasons I'm happy to read this. I like it.
55,54,It doesn't even matter what the mask is you should wear it.
59,54,"The government wants the public to believe their decisions, not the government's."
67,54,"Vaccination is a moral obligation, not a right. Vaccination is a moral obligation and it's a moral obligation to protect the public from being infected."
76,54,I'm sure you'll have a lot of trouble finding a troll account at work.

89,54,... you're just like... a woman?
91,54,"I was a little curious about this because I was a young girl. But as a kid, I had a hard time finding anything about it, and I don't even think I've ever heard of it. I knew I had to find a place that was full of people who weren't aware of the dangers if they don't have them.

100,54,"I think they should just impose on people the idea of wearing a mask. But if they could, it wouldn't be as cool a thing. That would be too bad for a normal person to be able to recognize it because they aren't familiar with it. I just don't see the need to say it's a great idea."

66,55,In addition to the massive covids I have mentioned on this sub... santa should have a mask. Ahhh I get it. The cdc has no authority to make the people wear a mask and are also not allowed to use them.

I am getting a lot of comments on this topic from people in different walks of life, but this post seems to have a lot to do with the fact that you are trying to come up with a way to prevent a pandemic because you want to be a part of the government, not the other way around."

55,35,This sub is very good. It’s not so much about the government but the fact that they’re trying to be the big apple. And they’re trying to be the government that wants us to put a stop to the spread of a virus.

55,54,"I think the whole concept of a mask is a little old. We could just tell that it might be an acceptable excuse or something. Then, maybe, one day the doctors at the school that isn't going to be taking part in the pandemic will realize it's not in your family, and put them on the meds to take care of their own health and provide for them.

55,26,I don't think it's a good idea to do vaccination. I think it's a better idea to get it done.
55,35,In the last two paragraphs the CDC's jokes that they use to enrage and devastate people on the internet have actually been very effective.

59,15,"It seems like it is something the US has been doing for a long time. The CDC has been trying to keep it as a policy and is now making some changes to it, like changing the laws for kids in the form of a fap test or something. It's very easy to make an attempt to make a policy that allows for the safety of the public."
59,28,My friends at college said that it was an important topic in our class. So what's the point of having a mask on in case of an emergency?
59,35,The article does not speak for the entire article. The point of a mask is to spout information to people who are not vaccinated.

59,51,We are all going to be sick of the idea of the CDC being such a big piece of shit and not getting anything done.
59,54,There are a lot of ways to combat this problem - a public health snarky or a fap test-- and you can easily stop a fap test if it's necessary.
59,56,Vaccination in general is a part of the health care system. You’re going to have to make a choice if you aren’t vaccinated. It’s a bad idea and will just make the people in the minority more likely to have the disease. That’s a great reason to be sick and sick.

59,35,They are not going to change the policy and in that case they will.
59,40,"The reason for this is that these vaccines are being abused and used as an excuse to try and prevent more deaths from the spread of the disease. I'm not saying they should stop or prevent these actions, but I do feel like that is one way to help people who are actually sick."
59,51,"It is illegal to wear a mask on Christmas, for whatever reason. This is the one thing that doesn't help in emergencies: it prevents the spread of a virus."
59,54,My country only needs about 25k people for the vaccine. I think it's a good sign they don't want to pay for all the public shaming.

59,56,It's a good sign that the CDC doesn't want to make any changes to the healthcare system and won't change it.

59,15,I'm also a pediatrician who was raised in a similar situation with my friends. I was vaccinated but it never became effective because a mask doesn't work because it faps. I was taught this by a doctor and was told that it doesn't work because if I smoked it I would be dead.

59,56,"Well, it's not an anti-virus. Vaccination isn't a health issue in a sense."
70,59,"As a non-emergency vaccine recipient, I can't think of a single person who'd ever do that to me."
75,59,So I'm not a doctor and my family is a doctor. But I've been vaccinated and got a lot of help for this. I feel sick every time and I'd rather be vaccinated for the flu.
79,59,"I'm not sure it's true, but it's worth rereading. The mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. What is the problem with this? Why do you think that the US government should be allowed to wear a mask all the time? The masks aren't mandatory in the US. They're required for 50 days during the year, for example."
84,59,This is a bit naive.
59,10,"I'm a doctor. The CDC is responsible for the costs of vaccines, and so is any federally mandated government. So they need to be made a part of their funding policy."

97,60,I wore a mask to prevent a viral infection. Usually when I'm going to get sick. I went to a pharmacy and told them to bring up a mask to prevent the virus and tell them I was having an infection. They brought it up because I was scared that I would get it from someone else.

60,34,I have no idea what it is or how it works. I'm a little bit in the minority but a lot of my family wear a mask in the midst of a virus.

63,60,"Honestly, I think that's pretty shitty of you to complain about the CDC, and even to not get involved in the CDCs activities. The CDC is a pretty shithead. I think you'd have better luck on these issues, as they aren't the only ones who are being attacked."
70,60,My girlfriend and I are at an airport wearing masks when we're there to protect against a virus. I can't even think of anyone to even see if it's a virus. So we have to go to the CDC and tell them to put a hp on them.
83,60,I am also a non-medical professional who has a problem with the medical service I am in. But I am not sure I understand what this means to me.
86,60,"You're probably right. I want to say, ""You know what they're saying, I can't help but feel like you're telling me what I know, I think it is just telling the truth."""
87,60,You are in danger. I don't know how to get out of there. You may be in a position where your health is in jeopardy. You are not a doctor and you don't want to be vaccinated.

101,60,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
60,15,I think the CDC should stop doing it in this context.
60,18,People don't even want to wear a mask or get vaccinated. They want to wear a mask. But a mask is not necessary to stop the spread of a disease. It's necessary for a healthy life. This is a legitimate concern for the government.
60,20,"I would like to clarify. I think you mean this as ""I want to wear a mask""?"
60,27,What if a doctor doesn't have a problem with his mask when it prevents the spread of viruses?
60,29,"I think the point of this sub is that when you ask a question you are getting answers. You have an answer that goes, ""How do I know you think this is a joke?"" And not just any joke."
60,32,"I can't believe the CDC hasn't released a new version of it in a long time, but I can confirm that it is part of a vaccination if they will not put a mask on. They are also the only public health agency that isn't required to wear the mask in public. I'd be a little bit more concerned with how the CDC is addressing a health problem, since they are only providing aid to prevent those who are being attacked. They aren't committing a vaccine."
60,34,I’m not a doctor. I’m a doctor. I’m a doctor.

62,60,"I like saying that, but I am a huge advocate for wearing a mask and it is unnecessary."
63,60,CDC should do something. They don't have a lot of things to do. They just don't have any.
70,60,This was the main point of the article.
83,60,Why the fuck does this mean nothing? There are no limits. You are doing the right thing.
86,60,"This is a very, very bad idea."

62,61,A guy with a fat lip and a fat lip in wore a mask on his first flight on a flight to Canada. He threw it off because it was uncomfortable and he didn't want to wear it on a flight with a fat lip and a fat lip in. He also got pissed when he heard he was wearing a mask and was trying to be polite with everyone in the crowd. It was hilarious!
82,61,I was told I could use a mask if I was asked. I was asked to wear one so that I could do my job without them being in the way. I was told to wear a mask every day. I told my boss. I am afraid of them getting out of their way.

61,16,I don't understand why people don't wear a mask. I don't understand why people have a bad habit of doing it.
61,22,You need to stop wearing a mask to get away from the fact that the government gave you a vaccine. This is where you get the opportunity to show your parents that they're happy to give you an option.
61,27,I don't think it's true.
61,31,I'm assuming that he is in a bad position. He is wearing a mask. But I'm not sure.
61,45,It sounds like there's a lot of pressure for people to not wear a mask when they need to get vaccinated.
61,47,Vaccination is a form of vaccination. That is the premise.
61,48,I'm a lawyer and I wore a mask. I just don't get it because it does not seem like that's the right thing to do. I just get my hands on some other thing.
61,56,This is why I feel bad for my country for being a free country.
62,61,So you wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus? That's pretty fucked up. I'd do it if it weren't for my vebbulldog. Wearing a mask in public is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
82,61,This is the most likely way to get them out of this situation.
86,61,... I feel like people here are over reacting. I've always felt like this is why people feel like they have to be afraid of being stung by a virus.
87,61,">Waving a mask outside while vaccinated... but the states still do not allow that. I do not know how to make it feel safe, but I think it's just part of the job. It's not like the health department and your government are incompatible with something. I think they think there aren't any symptom of HIV. That's why they didn't have the virus as a priority for the disease."
95,61,"In my country, you don't get a virus vaccine. You get an HIV infection vaccine, but it is also an influenza b."
98,61,"Ahhh, I figured out why I was in the first one."

61,13,This is pretty clear cut and I'm not sure what to get out of it.

61,27,I'm not a lawyer.
61,31,"I don't understand how people can even take that as an issue that is the main issue with having a mask. The same can be said about being able to get the vaccine by wearing a mask (I'm not even sure if that's the problem) and being able to go through a quarantine. If you aren't able to get a vaccine, I feel that you would be able to get the vaccine in a way that does not allow you to take a rash or be able to fucking around with a mask."
61,45,>I feel like people here are over reacting. I've always felt like this is why people here are over reacting. I've always felt like this is why people feel like they have to be afraid of being stung by a virus.
61,47,I can’t imagine how the government would do a good job at this sort of thing. The virus is going to spread across a broad variety of countries.

62,24,"I'm not sure why people like wearing a mask. I'm just curious. How 'likely' that will be interpreted if you don't wear a mask on a plane, or if that's just a 'likely' way to stop the spread of a virus?"
62,42,I am an anti-virus activist.
62,47,"The NSA is going to try and impose the strictest laws on all people, even those whose immunity is reduced or eliminated by doing so. Sadly, the NSA is not helping the population."

101,62,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."

62,55,What a joke. Just a joke. What a joke.
62,56,The point of wearing a mask in a funny way is that it elicits social reactions that you won't be comfortable in.

62,61,"I'd just wear a mask. ""Have you seen the movie ""The Girl Who hacked into the wall? ""?"
78,62,It's a prank. I don't think it's a prank. The people in Texas have no legal right to wear a mask. They can't wear a mask during Christmas and they cannot have the right to wear a mask. They are focusing on helping stop the spread of a virus.

63,60,"Apparently, that's the reason everyone is in the first place:"
78,63,Those things seem to be an understatement here. Specifically I think it is the antiseptic policy to avoid it.

78,63,Wearing a mask is a good thing to do for yourself and people. When someone else goes on a mission it's a great thing to do for yourself. When someone's sick they can wear a mask for themselves and you will be a much healthier person.

78,63,"It's not just the government, but people. A lot of people don't know how to wear a mask."
84,63,"It's not all about the masks. But there's a lot of nihilists who think that wearing masks in the public has nothing to do with dna. I'd rather not wear a mask in public because they have an issue with the lack of social interaction of people. They want to get people to learn more about their health.

You're being racist and you are ignoring it - it is a very important and important part of healthcare. It does make me feel uncomfortable and it makes me uncomfortable, but it also makes me feel like a kid that they were vaccinated, which I do now"
66,24,I see it as a really good idea for you to keep your head down on your face when you are vaccinated because you want the public to feel better and can be informed about the threat to others.
66,30,Vaccination is a necessary health policy and you need to be vigilant and act with caution.
66,55,If you can get my rabid kids around you with a mask you should definitely consider that.

66,24,So I've just got a mask and a vaccination.
66,30,"When a sane and competent doctor decides to remove a mask, a good doctor will put in a new one so they can prevent it from spreading. A good doctor will let a person stay at a hospital for 2 months, and they're going to have a better chance at finding the proper vaccine."
66,55,In addition to the massive covids I have mentioned on this sub... santa should have a mask. Ahhh I get it. The cdc has no authority to make the people wear a mask and are also not allowed to use them.

66,24,"I have a lot of friends with asthma, and they have been vaccinated. It is like saying 'if they could stop spreading the virus, they'd like to do it.'Is this a good idea?"
66,30,"The movie, starring Donald Trump, explains that the federal government has no authority to make people wear a mask. And I cite it because I believe the CDC doesn't use the term ""vaccine"" in the words of the wiki entry."
66,55,"I'm a Republican, and this was the first movie I read."
67,66,I thought it was a joke but it isn't.

66,24,">I'm actually a bit of a vebbulldog, so I'm definitely going to wear a mask."
66,30,The CDC has the authority to force people to wear masks in cases like this. It doesn't need to be a joke. It needs to be part of the policy.
66,55,"What's the point of the movie? If he's a vebbulldog he's not a virus in a mask. I don't want to help you with that, but you're the only one who has been able to stop this spread of a virus."

66,24,"I’m glad you can understand how a prank is a joke. The CDC doesn’t have a duty to force people to wear a mask, so they don’t make a prank about it."

66,30,"This is a really good point. But, I'm going to be a bit more critical in my explanation. The problem is, we're not just speaking in terms of the government, we're talking about the federal government."
66,55,Are you the one who doesn't get why a prank is a prank? I don't understand why people think the CDC should force people to wear a mask for the sake of preventing a virus.
67,66,"I'd say there isn't an ""ideal joke"" to talk about, or more likely to not make it at all. If it is, I'm pretty sure you'd just get a little nervous if you read the article and just assume people don't know how to deal with it and if they're not willing to talk with you."

66,12,"I like the idea of wearing a mask while vaccinating my kids, but I think the entire idea is ridiculous, and it's not like there's any way it's not possible for people to wear it, and it's a prank. Basically, the problem is if you aren't a doctor, you don't even need to wear a mask, it's just a prank, and it's a prank."
66,24,"I want to tell you this, I'm not a doctor and I'm not a doctor. I don't believe in a mask."
66,30,I can't imagine the people at a hospital asking about it being a prank. Isn't it just about making it seem like a joke.
66,55,"Vaccination is a great way to prevent the spread of viruses in your family, and it's really important to keep them away from you. If you think they are the good ones, you have to do something about it, and you have to stay away from those that have already tried to protect themselves. I suggest that you avoid putting yourself at risk and are prepared to work towards finding a way to prevent that."
67,66,"This is how you make a joke about vaccination. In the UK, they're only allowed to use the doctor's office. It's called a ""devil's job"" and it's a part of the government's mandate to keep people alive."

99,66,The CDC and the CDC are all at fault for the CDC's failure to stop the spread of a virus.

66,55,It's just a prank. It doesn't need to be funny. It needs to be a prank. The problem is that the CDC has no authority to make the people wear a mask.
67,66,It seems that the government has a huge problem with public health awareness. What's important is the privacy of the public.

She hasn't gotten one in a while, but I think she was doing the right thing by saying something along the lines of ""Well you can still have a good laugh when you're in a fight with your family."" I think she has a bad idea with the MRSA shit. I know what I mean and I think that is a good thing, but there is just something in here where you feel really bad for the people who wear a mask."
67,30,"It's the other way around. In many places it's difficult to keep people from getting vaccinated, but they don't have any kind of protection. The only thing they can do is make sure the public knows what they are doing, and the people who have been in a vaccination will know that."
67,33,"No one is wearing a mask for the holidays and no one is asking for someone to be vaccinated, even if their family does have an ebola-like infection, I'm not sure I'd be allowed to wear one, but if I were in their position, they would be able to go and tell me."
67,34,Is there a CDC-endorsed safety protocol for making your skin visible when you wear a mask?
67,36,> Is this part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus?
67,48,I've heard that the answer is : But you don't want to be vaccinated?
67,49,"I see no reason why wearing a mask would do anything, it seems like it was a very logical choice."

67,56,You... I'm a bit of a fucking joke.
67,66,There is an American wiki entry on that.
83,67,It is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
84,67,"i see the difference between wearing the mask if you don't want to, and if i don't want to, it's a bad idea to get a cd of it in front of the mirror."
85,67,"My first thought is: “We don’t wear a mask. I don’t wear a mask for fear of tripping over the wall”. You don’t get a good laugh when you’re in a fight with your family, do you? It is kind of hilarious to me when I read about how this guy said he was gonna get a lot of people talking about this and the shit people said he is. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
87,67,">Waving a mask outside while vaccinated... but the states still do not allow that. I do not know how to make it feel safe, but I think it's just part of the job."
91,67,A mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
99,67,"I don't know about this one, but I'm wondering if people are not willing to spend money on a mask when they have the chance to use it, because you don't want to get hurt because you're wearing a mask."
67,6,">As someone who is not familiar with this topic, I would like to say that 'the only reason you can make an emergency decision is if you don't want to be vaccinated' sounds like a pretty good example of what the CDC does :"
67,8,I've been in the same situation. I was blown away by how well people seemed to respond and the general reaction I got to this.
67,11,People who are not vaccinated have been vaccinated.
67,14,"In the US, if you're allergic to a virus, you are allowed to wear one. This is a part of your rights to be safe from the spread of the virus, not your responsibility to protect yourself, or to keep yourself safe from other diseases."
67,19,It's not a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.
67,25,You can wear a mask in an emergency. But it is not the only way to keep yourself safe.
67,26,I think we should have a discussion about this topic if the people who use masks aren't willing to spend money on them.
67,30,"The government can't have a mandate on a'masked person'. If it's a public mandate, you need to know that it doesn't work."
67,33,"No, people do not want to be vaccinated. The issue is that a person has no right to be vaccinated, or any right to be vaccinated, and it's not the same as getting a vaccine in the first place."
67,34,"Why do we even need a mask? I am a CDC specialist and have had a CDC infection, so I'm pretty sure we don't need one."
67,36,"It's hard to believe that everyone isn't willing to be vaccinated because it is necessary to prevent people from getting sick and getting infected, and that a few people who are willing to not be vaccinated by the law aren't going to be able to vaccinate the rest of their family, and that a lot of people who don't want to have their hands tied aren't going to be able to afford a vaccinate because they do not feel safer."
67,48,Is it something to do with not being able to get up and start to eat if you can't stand your head up when you're wearing a mask?
67,49,"I'm not a CDC spokesperson but I can tell you something about the reason why wearing a mask is a good idea, especially when you're not in a fight with someone."
67,54,"I'd wear a mask, like I wore to work. The only reason I'm not allowed to be vaccinated is to be seen or to be vaccinated."
67,56,"I'd be a little surprised if you're not wearing a mask during a fight. I've been vaccinated, but I didn't have any idea that there is an actual disease in your body."
67,66,I thought it was a joke but it isn't.
83,67,"A doctor is going to scream at her husband if he wears a mask, and tell him not to go into that school."
84,67,I feel bad for the person who did this to me. But it's been a while since I heard any positive messages of any kind from this man...

91,67,It is actually the government's only role to prevent the spread of a virus. They are making it so much more effective than it should be. They are also trying to extort money away from the people who actually need to buy the virus.
99,67,I read this book on Thanksgiving. I never noticed the masks were wearing out as far as I could tell.
67,6,I’m also not familiar with what the CDC does. The CDC vaccinates a lot of people. That’s the problem.
67,8,I don't know if I've seen any pictures of people being vaccinated. But I do know that I've seen a few of the stories in this thread. I can't imagine that the other comments say this. It's pretty ridiculous.
67,11,"I've seen an article a couple times about the issue of how people can be vaccinated. They are not supposed to wear them as a reason, because they aren't allowed to use them as a way to prevent the spread of a virus. They need to see a doctor about it."

This is a part of your rights to be safe from the spread of a virus, not your responsibility to protect yourself, or to keep yourself safe from other diseases."
67,19,This is one of those things where your hands don't even get tucked in the bag of food.
67,25,What do you mean by a joke? Apparently the guy who said it was a joke didn't mean to. Unless they wanted to go to the school and they said the guy did. And they got the CDC to do it anyway.

67,33,"It's like a rape movie, where they give people an immunity test to prevent an ebola virus."
67,34,The CDC does not mandate you to wear a mask to get vaccinated.
67,36,People who aren't vaccinated are on a mission.
67,48,"My mom was in a hospital in Michigan to get her daughter vaccinated. Her mom is a doctor, so she wants to keep her friends and family out of the hospital."
67,49,This guy has a good point. I feel bad for his husband for not wanting to wear a mask and for not wanting to be vaccinated. I'm not saying he can't get it done. If you want to know that's not going to happen then you need to go to the doctor and explain what the CDC can do.

91,67,"If you wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus, you will be exposed to a wide range of viruses. The problem here is the government. It does not want to make the same threats over and over, it wants to make them think that it's a symptom of a more serious problem, but it doesn't want to be the problem at all. There is no way to stop the spread of a virus without some sort of intervention from the government, and the problem is the government not letting people know that they are attempting to keep them safe and it is going to"
99,67,"Isn't it just part of the ""what I want to wear"" quote?"
67,6,It's a good idea if you're trying to get the public out of the situation. Just remember that even if you aren't vaccinated you won't get infected. You don't 'have to' fight to your death.
67,8,I don't understand this one. It's pretty ridiculous. It's really not a joke. It's a joke.
67,11,"I would love to read an article about this to see if anyone actually knows that the government has no obligation to prevent people from getting vaccinated in order to prevent people from getting sick and dying, and they need a doctor."

67,34,"They said the people who have the disease and who are not vaccinated have been vaccinated, but not everyone can get it. The people who aren't vaccinated have not been vaccinated."
67,36,"In the states with the highest rates of vaccination for vaccines, vaccines and ebola vaccines are allowed at the hospital. I would recommend an outside vaccinate, if you're not vaccinated. It would be easier to do your own research and not rely on some one's judgement, which would also work in the field."

91,67,There is a lot of unintended consequences of wearing a mask. But the answer is... there's no way for this to be the same. The reason the government is so busy protecting people is because they don't have a lot of money.

67,33,Yes I agree with everyone who says the government is a joke and the UK is in it. The NSA is in a bit of a bind. I'm guessing there is an American person with a bad temper who wears a mask in order to prevent the spread of HIV.
67,34,"Vaccination is a right, it's a moral obligation, and I think a doctor should be able to make the right decision."
67,36,The US gov't needs to enforce the laws. I'm not sure where you're coming from.
67,48,"I'm not sure what you mean by that. I'm not sure what your meaning is, but the question you're asking isn't the 'do doctors have the right to vaccinate in a public place?'"
67,49,"I know it's a joke, but a mask in public places is a joke."
67,54,"Vaccination is a moral obligation, not a right. Vaccination is a moral obligation and it's a moral obligation to protect the public from being infected."
67,56,"If you want to say I'm an asshole, I'll bet you are. This is a joke and it's just about the fact that you're a dog lover and the whole situation makes you think it is funny. I don't think this is a good joke. But it doesn't stop the spread of the virus."
67,66,It seems that the government has a huge problem with public health awareness. What's important is the privacy of the public.
83,67,A doctor who knows how to help his patients is going to have to make a huge deal of the government to prevent their family from getting sick.
84,67,The NSA is attempting to extort money from the people that actually need to buy HIV and other diseases.
85,67,"IANAL, but I'd like to add that a lot of things are made to have an arousal. One is the'mildest' thing and the other is an act that has been done by many many governments. You're making some big claims about the NSA and a few others, all of which are not a good enough reason to be involved in this.

70,68,"I'd say the problem is that if the government has a policy to prevent the spread of a virus (and I think it does, and it has a policy to help prevent it) then it's unlikely that the government will care about stopping the spread of the virus."
73,68,No. That's not a bad thing. If the masks were to stop the spread of the virus then it'd be really hard to stop.
93,68,The underlying idea that people are infected by the virus is based on the fact that a man is infected with the virus.
100,68,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
68,21,This guy is a patriot. He deserves to be seen with a face mask.
70,68,"You're saying that the CDC is trying to help the CDC keep up with the health care needs of the country. That's pathetic, too."
73,68,"I’m the one who thinks that in a perfect world, all a dick can do is put a mask on. I think that in the world a dick can’t get on a mask that’s used to remove a virus (that makes it easier to get the virus out of your body)."
93,68,"If I wanted a joke on a joke I'd just say,"
100,68,"People who don't know what a ""walking mask"" is, are really weird. I don't know what the definition of a ""walking mask"" is, but I think this is what people say. There are actually people who are so very, very strange and strange that they think they are very cool."

93,68,"Nope, it's really funny. I'm a nerd but I'm more of a person who wears a mask a lot because of this. I like the way you do it."
100,68,I think the biggest problem with wearing a mask is that it doesn't really address the issue that is spreading.

70,68,">We have a rule that says the public is required to wear a mask to stop this. That's an idiotic rule, because they have no other right to do so. So what are you going to do with the mask?"
73,68,"The mask thing is funny because they've called it ""a retort"" and you didn't think about it."
93,68,The thing about wearing a mask is that it causes an infected person to feel nauseous. If I wanted to play a game I'd wear a mask for the same reason.
100,68,I think you just blew it off and you're being kind of weird.
68,21,"The mask thing is funny because they've called it ""a retort"" and you didn't think about it."
70,68,"That's kinda what the CDC says. And if you get sick from a virus then the CDC is trying to help keep up with the government's health care needs of the country. That's not the policy here.

100,68,"I would like to say that I don't like wearing a mask because I don't know what a python is. I think that my sense of humor is based off my understanding of what a python is. However, I also have some opinions of what it means to wear a mask, so I think it's nice that you don't wear a mask."
68,21,"It has been around for a long time, and I can't stand it if we continue to see it being worn by people. It's not my opinion that we should wear a mask in every emergency or that we should prevent it from spreading."
70,68,">I thought that if you get sick from a virus you will be infected."""
73,68,"You haven't fought for this guy's health or being in a public place, hasn't it? The CDC has just been out of town for three years now and we're still battling this epidemic. They just don't want anyone in their lives to live like that, so it's not a good idea to wear one on your birthday."
93,68,This isn't a joke. This is a joke.
100,68,The thing is I wear a mask in the middle of the day and if I get sick I won't get infected.

90,69,This is a pretty typical slapstick -- joke. It's so cute.
91,69,...and the worst part of this is that the government is not interested in supporting anyone who can stop it and is attempting to stop it.

91,69,"A good example of this is the CIA being a good guy - ""The NSA is making a bomb on a family friend. So now the kids don't know what a virus is, they know that if you tell them you don't have a virus, they might be interested in having you wear a mask."" That's the part of the NSA's argument that you shouldn't be using your mask to hide a virus."
69,15,... he's being a joke in a nutshell.
69,40,I think this is how people make it so it doesn't sound so nutty. It's because the NSA makes them so stupid because they don't actually understand what they're doing :-)

70,69,"Honestly I don't like wearing a mask because it doesn't have the ability to stop the spread of the virus, and I don't think there is anything worse than the fact that people in our own country do wear masks."
85,69,I don't see how anyone would be in a position to be able to genuinely tell people about a viral or disease that he did not know existed. But the truth is the NSA is a raging animal that is using masks to get people to wear them because they feel they're not being used in the correct way. It's an inhumane tool that doesn't exist because people have no knowledge of what a virus is.
86,69,"This article really reminds me of how we are taught the word ""mask"" in English class and the way people use it."

He said something along the lines of, ""I'm in a bad place and this is a prank and I'm not going to get a prank but I don"
69,43,I believe the NSA just started making a joke about the use of masks when some people are infected with a virus.

86,69,I'm gonna say it is a bit weird.

70,15,"So I think it's a bit pathetic to think that the government should require people to wear masks in any way if they need to prevent spread of a virus. If a person didn't have their hands sterilized and put on a mask, then the government should have gotten the best of both worlds - a lot of the time you can't just take a mask to prevent the spread of a virus."

70,24,"In the US, the federal government is responsible for preventing or preventing the spread of any virus."
70,48,"In other news, it is more likely that people will be more resistant to the vaccine as they can be more resistant to it. That means that the government will be more aggressive and will be more apt to help with this vaccine than the people who aren't in the US."

100,70,It is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
101,70,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
70,3,You sound like the kind of guy that will be trying to give your kids a better understanding of what a virus is and how it is spread. The CDC is ignoring this and not taking action.
70,4,My name is Kate. What are you going to do with the mask? I have to get it off now.
70,7,"We should wear a mask in every emergency, and the CDC can't make it a ""must be vaccinated"" policy."
70,15,This is a shame. I don’t care about people or their privacy. The government has no right to regulate the public health system.
70,24,This is why I work in healthcare at a hospital. We need to work together as a team to improve public health. I work on health teams to improve the quality of our work and we need to work with our volunteers to be able to help.
70,48,"So, you just read the article and said that he is trying to stop the spread of a virus and he hasn't gotten the message yet. I think he's actually saying that he's actually trying to stop the spread of a virus. Specifically, he hasn't actually been doing the cdc or the government to stop the spread of a virus and that they need to get it out of the country."
70,59,">we should wear a mask in every emergency, and the CDC can't make it a ""must be vaccinated"" policy. They can make it a ""must be vaccinated"" policy, but that's not the policy here."

70,69,So you have a few choices here. One is to make a mask and the other to wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus.
74,70,"So you don’t like the notion of “It’s funny how you wear a mask, but... I don’t like wearing a mask in public. But that’s a shame. But I can relate a bit to these memes."
85,70,"I've got a vebb and I don't wear a mask on my birthday, because I don't want a big tummy to see me around, and because of my skin, and my hair. I don't know what it feels like to be around someone without their dog, but if I did, I'd know what's the problem."
92,70,There's a reason people hate this vaccine...
100,70,"In my country, I have a python mask."
101,70,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
70,3,"And then they get the ""it's a shame"" memo. They're not doing anything unless there's some kind of mandate."
70,4,It's just an idea that I have no interest in going to the CDC and they're not going to get involved with it.
70,7,"I know that people think vaccinating your pets will make you sick. I wouldn't want my kids to get ill without a mask and I wouldn't want to feel bad for their privacy. So what is your job, Kate? You're the kind of person who doesn't want to be around other people and you have to go to the CDC to help them, you're a veb. You need to take care of your children."
70,15,"So your doctor is giving you a headache, not knowing if you're infected with a virus or if it's just one bad virus, then you're infected?"

74,70,"It's a pity if it's a joke, but it's kinda creepy."
85,70,I'm an expert on the subject of masks and I've met people who say the same things. They're also very good at explaining things to us as a person.
92,70,So you're assuming that a number of people in this sub aren't saying the same things.
100,70,"I don't think it's so weird to think people actually wear masks. I don't know a lot about these things. It's more like saying, ""If you get sick you will be infected."" People with a mask have no idea what a python is. They wear a mask because they have no idea what a python is. They have no idea what a python is. They have no idea what a python is. I think this is what people say."

70,69,"As long as it's not the CDC doing anything to stop the spread of the virus, you are safe. The CDC doesn't really know what a mask is. But at least the CDC can be very quick to put a stop to it because of what is actually going on with their office, not what's going on with the health department. I wouldn't worry about the safety, just do whatever it takes to keep your mouth shut."
74,70,You guys - if you have a very high understanding of the concept of a mask- have a frank conversation.
85,70,"> It's not that you didn't care about your husband's dog's health and it's not that you don't want your own. It's not the truth. In order to avoid spreading the virus I have to wear a mask at least once a week, or once a month (at least once a month). If your dog has a small belly and is unable to walk without a mask, it’s probably more likely that you’ll break it and go to a doctor."
92,70,"I have a phobia about the word ""snoop"" as it relates to a lot of things. I'm pretty sure I don't really like a lot of people on the internet who like to snoop and the guy I actually snooped on has mental health issues.

74,73,I'm a bit of a vebbulldog. And I like to wear a mask all the time. In my opinion the most interesting thing about the week is that the mask is wearing it to stop the spread of a virus.

73,6,"I think that the problem is that he's getting a lot of attention for a stupid meme, and I don't really understand why it would be inappropriate to wear a mask. Wearing a mask on someone is not an act of kindness or an act of kindness."
73,13,"Its not what it is, its what it is. AIDS is not an infectious disease. If there is a virus it can be spread very easily. Its because it's not a virus that's been shown to be prevalent."
73,17,"The whole problem isn't in the government's best interest, but in the people who are."
73,19,The government has to do something. Its not something that's a little dangerous or offensive. It's a government thing.

73,51,I think the fact that it's a dickhead is a bad sign - people aren't going to tell him about that.
73,57,"Yes. If a mask were to stop the spread of a virus, then it would be really hard to stop. If you can't get rid of it, then there is a LOT of money that needs to be wasted, and it wouldn't go anywhere without a mask."
73,68,A man has a python that he grew up with and the government does not want to enforce.

101,73,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."

If he wasn't there to fight and fight the virus then no one would listen to him and he would be going to jail or in prison, and they would try to help the AIDS epidemic."
73,13,I've heard a couple of these people and their husband's wives say it isn't the right thing to do. The fact that they aren't aware of the problem is just another example of what might be happening.

91,73,"It isn't an involuntary government war, it's an involuntary one. This isn't a conspiracy or a morally correct and inexcusable conspiracy to prevent the spread of a virus. Unless your friends are in the military, then they have no duty to try to stop it."
99,73,Wearing a mask to prevent the spread of a virus is not helping to stop the spread of a virus. That's why a mask is not going to get a lot of sympathy.

74,41,In my opinion the most interesting thing about the week is that the mask is wearing it to stop the spread of a virus.

74,56,I like this meme so much that I don't even know if it was about me being covid but just a bit uncomfortable as the fact it makes me feel better.
74,70,"That’s really pretty crazy. I’m actually a bit of a vebbulldog, so i’m definitely going to wear a mask."
74,73,My husband has a mask that he wears and he will wear it when he goes home.

74,73,"That is a shame. But I can relate a bit to these memes. They are all really revealing. And I'm glad you guys got the idea for this one. But the people are also going to say that they can be uncomfortable. So don't wear a mask in public, don't talk about it, and don't think about it in real life."
85,74,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. I would have had a problem with this, it's a sad problem with our society, and it's not my thing. He was born in 1898 and has a dog named Jaad Jaad.

74,56,That's really pretty crazy.
74,70,What's your name? This is a little too obvious to say. I don't think I can help you at all.

74,15,There's always a problem with how we communicate. You are not going to know what's going on around you.

74,41,"I have two friends who work at a company, but I can't remember the name of it. They've been there for about 10 years and I've seen no proof unless they were actually there for the first time. If they were, they are a good friend and have been able to help them. If they were not, their friend wouldn't have been there."
74,46,"I feel like I'm over thinking, but I have a good idea as to why I'm wearing a mask in public. I'm afraid it's a shame."
74,56,"This isn't the sort of thing that the most interesting thing is. It was a funny piece of advice that everyone has made about being ""a bit ""of a vebbulldog."
74,70,"So you don’t like the notion of “It’s funny how you wear a mask, but... I don’t like wearing a mask in public. But that’s a shame. But I can relate a bit to these memes."

74,15,Why do people wear a mask when there is no research?
74,27,I have a very high understanding of the concept of a mask. I've always believed that if someone had a mask they would actually wear it. I have not felt anything like that since being a person without a mask - they've seen nothing but their friends with masks who do not wear them.
74,41,I am a bit vebbulldog. And I have a good idea as to why I'm wearing a mask in public.
74,46,I think we're at least part of the solution to this. I feel like I need to talk to you about a few things. You need to be more open to discussion about how to stop the spread of a virus and about what the problem is with our society.
74,56,I don't know if it's that bad - but I've seen enough to believe it.
74,70,"It's a pity if it's a joke, but it's kinda creepy."

85,74,It's not that you didn't care about your husband's dog's health and it's not that you don't want your own. It's not the truth.
100,74,"This is a subreddit where you say ""We're just a bunch of people with a mask who wear a mask and then just wear a mask and a mask, a little like a python."". Or, like you said, ""What makes you think that's a big deal?"""

74,27,We are not going to get a mask. And that's not a problem.

74,70,You guys - if you have a very high understanding of the concept of a mask- have a frank conversation.
74,73,The first part of the post is an explanation of how to prevent people from getting a viral era virus.
85,74,"''We are playing an awesome game of paintball on tv''' - fyi, a few days ago. ''Want to wear a mask on my birthday''', 'Why would I?"
100,74,It's a python costume. It's a python costume that's part of a mask.

74,5,"I think we should all do something. People don't have to be in a mask all the time to stop a virus. Unless it's really going to affect a person or a country, it's not a good thing."
74,15,I see a lot of people wearing masks. The first part of the post is a question - which seems obvious: how can you help them?
74,27,Is it possible that people are wearing masks? I don’t see why you would wear a mask in public. I just want to let people know you’re not trying to stop the spread of a virus.
74,41,"I don't think there is anything wrong with wearing a mask. Is there a way to change that? Because if so, there is a way for it to be removed, and then a way to make it permanent and it's all down to the wearer's ability to work through the symptom of a virus, and a way to give the people in charge of keeping it from getting their own."
74,46,I'm the first person to point out that I don't actually know how to make people wear masks when they have a virus.
74,56,"I'm not gonna lie, I don't know a lot about people, but I do know the cynicism that's at play here. :)"
74,70,"I'm a veb bulldog, and I like the concept. But I don't like wearing a mask, nor the idea of it being a joke, or a joke."
74,73,Yes. But I'm actually a vebbulldog so it's a joke that makes me want to wear a mask... it's creepy. Its a vebbulbdog... so I'm a vebbulldog. Its a vebbulbdog.
85,74,"A lot of people have no idea how to live. It's not a joke. If you're going to be a cynic or something, then you can't live like you did when the NSA was in operation. This is a joke, and you need to be more careful not to get involved. There are plenty of other dogs who have their own problems, and while they may have no problems with their own problems, they have very little information about it."
100,74,And yet people don't wear masks anymore.
74,1,"""We need to stop the spread of a virus. We are not going to get a mask. And that's not a problem."""
74,5,We're going to have to get a lot of money to pay for masks. This is what a public figure will do.
74,15,"I can imagine why this would be a big deal. I am not the biggest fan of the ""We are playing an awesome game of paintball on tv"" in this subreddit. I mean, I don't think you can have a joke on it, if you think people are trying to stop the spread of a virus, you just have to be brave and ask them out."
74,27,"""As soon as I learn the concept of a mask I'll get it away from me."""
74,41,"I can't really get the rest of the conversation on how to prevent people from getting a virus, but I am more concerned that the CDC is still trying to sort it out, and that we are putting pressure on these people."
74,46,I'm trying to be more honest with you because I've seen you here a couple of times but I still can't take a joke from you.
74,56,What a joke. It sounds like there's some kind of'serious' point of view in there but I don't think that'serious' is an obvious point. It's the idea of a vebbulldog that is just a veb bulldog. I've been watching tv for years but I haven't been able to get people to wear a mask unless they want to. There's no way I've ever seen a vebbulldog.'s a veb bull

74,73,"The only reason I am wearing a mask is because I know a woman who wore one for her birthday, and I didn't think she would ever wear it."
85,74,"This doesn't sound funny but I will have to read it for you. If you are an inquisitor, you should be able to tell you that a dog's health is a big deal in the government."
100,74,I think the real problem with wearing a mask is that it doesn't really address the issue that is spreading.
74,1,This post is a joke.
74,5,A lot of people want to wear masks and they can't wear a mask.
74,15,"The only one I saw wearing a mask for was a dude who wore one when he sat in the office and he was saying ""hey the government is allowing dogs to come into this country, they want me to come and see my dog."""

74,70,"I’ve never seen a dog wear a mask in public. I’ve seen many veb bulldogs wear masks for work. I also can’t imagine having a vebbulldog wearing a mask when I saw a girl in her 80’s wearing a mask. I think a lot of people are going to find something to wear on their holidays. But, it seems like a lot of people are putting a lot of effort in to prevent people from getting a virus."
74,73,"There's always something to do, but nothing you can do is make people feel uncomfortable. Wearing a mask at your home can be dangerous."
85,74,"The ""Nastiest Act of All Time"" has a lot to do with people being in the NSA."
100,74,I think it is cool that people are taking this idea and making it about the idea of the problem.
74,1,"I don't like to see the face of people, but I think a mask might help prevent the spread of a virus, so I'm just saying I don't want the world to know about it."
74,5,This was posted on /r/reddit a few days ago. I was a bit overwhelmed by all of the posts about this.
74,15,"I don't see why this would be a big deal. I'm not the biggest fan of the ""We are playing an awesome game of paintball on tv"" in this subreddit."
74,27,"I'm a guy, I don't think I can wear a mask. I wear a mask for work. I've seen people wearing one in my life."

74,46,"I think this isn't a big deal. I mean it's just a big deal. I have nothing to do, but the point of this post is to 'help' people."
74,56,People are going to try and talk about the problem. I'm not really sure why you're trying to do the stuff you don't want to do.
74,70,Is this a joke? No.
74,73,...but I’ve never seen anything but their friends with masks who do not wear them.
85,74,I think he is making too much of a joke.
100,74,It seems like the biggest problem with wearing a mask is that people aren't properly protecting themselves.

76,75,continuing to mask up and distance reduces the transmission of the virus and if you do get it the virus won t leave you your immune system will handle it vaccines also reduce pressure on overwhelmed healthcare systems vaccines mean more milder cases if the vaxxed do get it
87,75,i m wearing a mask outside while vaccinated because people like you are in my face why does it bother you to the point that you are asking random people why they are doing something that makes them feel safe
90,75,hey i just saw you are running miles across florida right now curious if you would share what is the route im in orlando and would love to come run with you even if just for a mile i d wear a mask and keep distance
100,75,really interesting in light of people s resistance to wear a mask both the mask and the shopping cart are measurements of empathy
75,1,We can't afford that. It seems like it has to be the most efficient way to get away from the fear of the pandemic.
75,2,"Wearing a mask helps prevent the spread of the virus, but at the same time, it will reduce your vulnerability to the virus if it lingers. I know a couple years ago that the government was concerned for those who did not want to run."
75,3,This seems like a joke.
75,12,"When I was in Orlando and got sick I would go to a party with a house full of people who weren't in my face. I would ask where I had the last mask I could find to get rid of them and get the rest of the people they would probably get sick at. Then again I can't seem to come back after my first bite of the papilloma, and I would wear a mask when they get sick."
75,19,Wearing a mask during a pandemic is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
75,20,"People like me don t even want to run in a pandemic. Sadly, there are other places I can t see that have a pandemic."
75,21,"A neo nazism will not be as successful in stopping a pandemic, they just want to make sure their bodies stay strong enough to survive. And to the point where they aren’t able to control their immune system in the face of the virus or other viruses."
75,23,People can be a little bit too afk and they are so afraid that they could face a full pandemic when they are not allowed to. People can be very nice and friendly and a person can help with anything else if they want.
75,26,The reason for this is the pandemic
75,34,"They aren t necessarily the problem, but they also aren t the culprit. There is always a chance there will be a pandemic or something."
75,38,"They don't have any protections from the pandemic, they just have to tell the government about the pandemic so they can spread the virus. Apparently there s an outbreak and the government is doing what they need to keep it from spreading."
75,45,"oh yea there are lots of times where people in a house full of ppl not wasting mask during a pandemic, but this isn't as effective as the people who are numb to the pandemic."
75,48,i'm going to be going to a party with a house full of ppl not wasting mask during a pandemic
75,49,Why do you think the gov't can keep the mask away?
75,55,I wouldn’t go to a party with a house full of ppl not wasting mask during a pandemic.
75,59,Go to a party with a house full of ppl not wasting mask during a pandemic don t go to a party with a house full of ppl not wasting mask during a pandemic
75,65,"If I was going to go to a party with a house full of ppl not wasting mask during a pandemic, I'd say I'd say that's the best way to go to prevent people from getting virus from your home."
75,71,he is not wrong at all and is not in the same room. do you like your way of thinking?
76,75,I know people in my local church say it is the most helpful thing ever for us to do and we all know what is wrong. Vaccination is about prevention. We need to be more proactive about preventative health.

75,1,"I think that's just the way it works, as people who have a phobia of going to a party a lot of the time, and some of them seem to be on a low note for how they would handle going to the party. You can't afford that. They just don't do it because they can't afford the time, or because they can't afford it, and their minds get blown out. But you can still go for a nice run at parties and people will run the jokes in your mouth. You're being a dissenting"
75,2,Vaccination is about prevention. We need to be more proactive about preventative health.
75,3,"I am not a doctor or doctor, but I would like to be able to show my friend what you mean. You are completely right to keep my body safe if you come down to the pandemic, and it is good to keep your friends safe. I also recommend getting a new mask that you can take off."
75,12,It is a symptom of a bad immune system because of the pandemic.
75,19,"People are sick. A pandemic is a problem. If you can't stop it by spreading the virus, you need a new one."
75,20,"In the U.S., it's mandatory to get a mask to prevent pandemics. I don't think it's a joke. I do think a mask does have a role in stopping the spread of a virus."
75,21,"I went to the party with a mask containing the people who wouldn't wear them. They didn't care what was going on. They knew that what was going to happen would happen if they didn't get their bodies to a certain level. They also said that they'd do everything possible to prevent a pandemic. In my experience a mask, and a mask, is one thing."
75,23,"You're actually getting a chuckle out of this, especially since it doesn't even include the word ""Material."""
75,26,"I can't get myself to wear a mask. So I just can't. It's kind of annoying, and I'm going to end up getting a cold and that makes me sick."
75,34,I am going to run in a pandemic. There are times when people like you are going out of their way to run a party.
75,38,"I'm not a papilloma guy, I am a papilloma person, so I'm really not sure what the difference is. Vaccination is an issue that I'm interested in but I'm not sure it's any less important than if I had the option to stay away from pandemics or if I was a huge papilloma fanatic. I also want to emphasize that people who aren't in my face are not necessarily the culprit. This is a huge problem and the biggest problem is that"
75,45,Wearing a mask while vaccinated can be a good thing.
75,48,"It's called ""Panthering at the Party"" in English, and it's called the ""Panthering at the Party"" in German. The term is intended to imply that the person that is ""snapping"" on is a part of the virus's genetic makeup."
75,49,It is the best thing ever for us to do. We need to be more proactive about preventative health. I would love to come out with my husband and have an interesting conversation about it.
75,55,I don't really like my gov't being the one putting out a pandemic and I would be going to a party with a house full of people who weren't in my face.
75,59,> Are you still wearing a mask?
75,65,"It seems like this is about being a part of the government. It's not about a pandemic, it's about being a part of the cause. It's not about stopping the spread of the virus. I'm not saying it's bad, it's the problem."
75,71,"Vaccination is a very useful, non-religious thing for children and young people. I believe it's not always enough to stop people from getting sick and dying. That's why it's the best way to protect a child from developing a child."
76,75,I love the vwiy. It's just a really good idea.
87,75,"I want to be vaccinated as well. However, I feel bad about this because I'm a doctor."

100,75,The idea that the mask is required to do the entire day of the week is a problem with the way people wear their masks - a mask for example - is not as effective as a mask for the day of a major change in the environment - people actually wear masks.
75,1,"If the person you see wasn't in your face, they wouldn't be able to see you."
75,2,The definition of a 'pants at the party' is the same as 'preventative health'. That's not an option.

75,26,"The issue is that in Germany, there's a mask to prevent the spread of a viral infection."
75,34,"""I can't wear a mask"" is a word used in many different contexts. This is a fucking joke - and they should be ashamed of it. Vaccination is a very good thing, but it should be a very small part of protecting the population."
75,38,"I'm sure that's why people want to get their face checked on and to see their own bodies. There's no 'no' in there, not enough room for me to be in the party"
75,45,"It is a huge problem, and not a joke."
75,48,"Aside from the obvious implication of ""being a part of the cause"" it's also a problem with the way people wear their masks. I don't think it's bad or in any way wrong but there is a difference between a mask and a mask."

I am getting a lot of comments on this topic from people in different walks of life, but this post seems to have a lot to do with the fact that you are trying to come up with a way to prevent a pandemic because you want to be a part of the government, not the other way around."
75,59,"The fact that they said ""the only way you'd be able to stop the spread of the virus is to get the new mask off,"" does not seem to be a joke. I would say it's more about making sure you're not wasting masks."
75,65,"My husband has a papilloma, and when I go to his party he wears a mask and is going to be going outside in a mask and drinking a glass of water to prevent someone from getting sick. This is pretty common practice."

100,75,The biggest problem is not that the idea that the mask is required to do the entire day of the week is not as effective as a mask for the day of a major change in the environment - people actually wear masks.

75,2,"If the government wants to stop the spread of a virus, it needs to have a policy on how to protect the population."

75,12,"In order to save the environment, people must wear masks. They are not a substitute for the health care or a treatment for the illness. They don't require that people wear them unless they are a threat to the public. I mean, it's not as simple as this."

75,59,What's this? I'm going to be lying to myself about the CDC and saying they need to get some health care done for the people in charge of protecting us from the papilloma.
75,65,I think the best way to prevent people from getting virus from your home is to wear a mask at all times.

75,48,I’m not sure what you mean by ‘no mask at all’. But it does seem like a simple word.
75,49,The CDC needs to stop putting out pandemics to stop the spread of a disease - they are not forcing people to wear a mask because they are not required to. They are doing this so they don't get caught in the act.

75,34,So is this a prank? Because it's a prank. It's the government's way of ensuring the spread of a virus and whatnot.
75,38,"Virus and vaccines, including papilloma, is not a prank, it is an anti-vaccine campaign, and the CDC has a program to help prevent the spread of a pandemic."
75,45,That's what a joke is.

75,65,"As I see it, this is a joke, and I do not believe it is anything else. I believe that the CDC uses a lot of things to get vaccines for people whose papilloma can be prevented from spreading. They use a program to prevent pandemics, like what 'pattal pandemics' are. It's also a prank because it helps prevent AIDS."
75,71,"I’m not a doctor, but I can hardly see the difference. I’m not sure why the CDC should do something pranks like this. Is there a special way to prevent pandemics?"

76,14,"I'm a medical doctor, and I wear a mask all the time, because it prevents me from getting infected. I don't know why but this one sounds like a good idea to me. I don't think people really need to wear a mask, despite the fact that this is a joke."
76,15,"I'm gonna say he should fuck with some guy who's swore to go to the doctor, who has the vaccine and has no medical history - it's all his fault and the guy is going to get vaccinated. You can't just take a bunch of pictures, but do it and it will work."
76,17,"They're going to need more funding, and that's going to require more smear campaigns and more awareness. You have a problem with it and can't fix it. They're going to need more money and more publicity to get your work done."
76,38,"Vaccination is about prevention. I'm a medical doctor, and I'd wear a mask all the time, because it prevents me from getting infected. I don't think people really need to wear a mask, despite the fact that this is the joke of the week a few months ago. I feel like this was the joke of the week a few months ago, but I was not much of a doctor and I was vaccinated against a virus. I don't think people really need to wear a mask, and bend over and bend over"
76,46,I see no problem with wearing a mask.
76,47,"Yes, it is a joke. Vaccination isn't about prevention. It's about prevention."
76,51,"""Vectors rely on a standardized method of spreading HIV, for the benefit of human health."""
76,52,">The whole point of wearing a mask is to help prevent the spread of a virus, it's useless and I hate it. I don't think people really need to wear a mask, despite the fact that this is a joke."
76,54,It's a joke.
76,71,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I mean, I've been in this'shit' before, and I don't understand why you're like ""I have the scars to look at."" Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it. I read that as ""A doctor has no intention of doing anything to stop the spread of a virus."" Vaccination is not about prevention."
76,75,So why do you wear a mask?
85,76,"It's a joke, and it's not a joke, sarcastic."
87,76,"Vaccine laws differ from state to state. What is important to you is that it is in fact what prevents your infection, and that you don't need a mask, to prevent infections from spreading."
93,76,"There is a lot of shithead talk about these things. And the truth is that they're an ad hoc joke, i.e. a haterly joke that says ""I don't think the government has anything to do with this. A virus can spread all over the country."""

101,76,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
76,6,Vaccination isn't about prevention. Vaccination is about prevention.
76,12,I don't think this is a joke. It's a blatant attempt to take away a virus. It's not about prevention. It's about prevention.
76,14,"I mean, I've been in this'shit' before, and I don't understand why you're like ""I have the scars to look at."""
76,15,The CDC hasn't shown this problem as an excuse. It explains why Vaccination isn't about prevention.

76,46,"It's a joke, he's a doctor"
76,47,"I don't like that you're just trying to hide a joke, you don't like the part where they just let people have a safe mask of a virus and try to mask it. Vaccination is about prevention. I hate the idea of being able to go to a doctor and give them a mask. And then to go into a doctor's office to talk about how much they mean to the community about the vaccination and /or a medical professional and how it can help them avoid their vebb and their illnesses in the future. I want to stop"
76,51,"I don't know how to explain this to you. I mean, it is a joke, but a lot of people don't understand. It's a joke, but it's about prevention."
76,52,I think the one sounded the most appropriate to the person at the time of this post was his parents. Despite that he seems to think that this is a joke to people who are not vaccinated against HIV/AIDS.
76,54,"The whole point of wearing a mask is to help prevent the spread of a virus, and that's not a joke, sarcastic. Vaccination isn't about prevention."
76,71,"If the government actually has the power to enact the vaccination program, and they can get it to actually do anything, the problem will never be solved."
76,75,"I've been in a situation where I've been vaccinated, I've been on a daily basis and I've noticed a huge difference. I'm sure the CDC has some problems, but we can make some progress."
85,76,"So, basically the same thing you said."
87,76,"""... I think this is one of the worst troll posts ever made. I'm just glad to be in this position but I just wanted to say that the only trolls I know who are opportunistic are those who're not. Vaccination is the worst vaccine - unless the vaccines are effective enough to keep people safe and protect themselves. It's also a non-higgins x virus. "","
93,76,You might be talking about the joke of the guy with a shit head. The joke is not about the shithead. It's about how people are influenced by a lot of things. I wear a mask on a run. It's hard to tell when my face isn't shattered by a virus. I don't know why but this is why I can't get it.
96,76,"*I'm a big person, I'm not a big person, I'm not a big person, I'm a big person."

76,12,Wearing a mask helps to protect yourself. This is why I'm a big person.
76,14,"It's about prevention, and prevention isn't about prevention. It's about prevention."
76,15,I like to wear a mask and bend over so I don't wear a mask.

76,17,I think it's a pretty good idea to be wearing a mask. I've noticed a noticeable difference between the two.
76,38,"That is why it's not just a joke, it's also a joke."
76,46,Vaccination is about prevention. Vaccination is about prevention. I'm just glad to be in this position but I just wanted to say that the only trolls I know who are opportunistic are those who aren't vaccinated against HIV/AIDS.

76,54,I'm sure you'll have a lot of trouble finding a troll account at work.
76,71,This is not the kind of joke I think anyone in this sub is utterly inept at. I've been in a situation where I've been vaccinated against HIV/AIDS.
76,75,I wear a mask because it prevents me from getting it.

77,2,It's a shame to scoff at people who don't like to be treated like that.
77,5,"I like a guy who runs in a mask when he runs. He's my favorite guy. But you need to get him to wear the mask! You should definitely take your family to the doctor to try it on, if you don't like it, you should stop it and get it in a box."
77,10,I think the point of wearing a mask is to allow someone to wear it. It's not like it's to keep someone able to go to work on the weekend or something like that.
77,11,"Its not a good idea to run a marathon or go to the races. If he gets attacked by a superspy, he'll wear a mask."

He said they had a good reason to wear the mask so I was like Oh yeah I can wear a mask and be nice to you! But my friend still hid in a pj and he took it out and told me he loved him. I told him he wore the mask and he got upset, and was like ""I didn't think it was a lie"" so I knew it was a lie."

77,11,>He's a fool. What's your point. The point of wearing a mask is to allow someone to see you.
77,12,"I don't think the language used to refer to this as a prank is really a savage, and I'd rather not wear a mask or my health. I can't think of anything more to say. But I would say if you sneeze and then run away, it's actually pretty cool."
77,29,"It seems like a lot of people are trying to push the idea of people wearing masks and it's like people are talking about people who aren't in a position to use it. In any case, it would have to be a big deal to keep everyone from having a problem with something if people don't know what is going on in the world. So, what you just described sounds a little bit like a ""nanny situation"". You sound a lot more like an inexperienced guy."
77,35,It's pretty weird. The point of wearing a mask is to allow someone to see you.

90,77,"In other words, a prank isn't supposed to work."
100,77,"The article says that if you get sick and you have no idea what a python is, if you wear a mask, you will have a really bad time."
77,2,If this were me I'd be a bit nervous about that part of a prank.
77,5,"A prank is a prank, it isn't supposed to work. A prank is a joke. It is a prank. The purpose of a prank is not to put your face on the sidewalk, but to put on a mask. Wearing a mask is a prank."
77,10,"I think that there are a lot of different versions of ""Potentially evil in a group, a person who loves to fuck people with a python, will be sick, and would never be able to go to a hospital and be infected."""
77,11,I like to run in a mask when he runs. He's my favorite guy. But now I feel like it was just a joke.
77,12,People who wear a mask will wear them because they think they're going to be abused. They're still victims of snobbery and they will be killed.

79,4,I grew up in the country. I live in a conservative county in the states. It s a hivemind and a very small part of the country whose state is the most conservative and we have to put up with the constant mask ban and bans. I don t know why but as a californian I am quite happy with our policy.
79,9,Why would we have a people who live in a conservative county and have no respect for their own privacy?

79,2,This isn't the new national holiday. It's a celebration of freedom.
79,4,There are actually two different types of masks that the government would use in its fight against the spread of the virus. The most common are those which prevent the spread.
79,9,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
79,12,My husband is a Republican and has had no problem voting against Obama.

Rather, they would be in a state whose law allows for masks in those circumstances. And what we need is a new, better version of a mask. I like to think we will always have it on Thanksgiving.

79,4,"In the US, masks aren't necessary. They are mandatory for a certain number of days during the year, for example. For example, the first time you wear a mask on Christmas, there's a 50 day period from New Years Eve through April 27th. When your husband wore a mask on Thanksgiving, he wouldn't get a mask because it's the only mask he wears for his Christmas shopping trips."

79,45,I'd like to add that this is the most shady and arrogant thing I've read in a while.
79,51,It seems like the Americans and the Republicans have the same issues about that. The U.S. government has the power to protect against a virus that has spread. The U.S. isn't allowed to wear a mask during holidays because it's so cruel. Whether they wear a mask at Christmas or not seems unlikely. It's just that the U.S. government isn't allowed to have a mask.
79,59,"In a large US country, you can not wear a mask at Christmas, you can't wear a mask at any kind of holiday. It isn't illegal. You cannot wear a mask for Christmas. You can wear your husband's and his family's health insurance policies. The government doesn't have a choice about whether or not to accept or not to refuse your treatment for your health, you have to accept the fact that your health insurance plan covers you and allows you to do so.

'If I wear a mask and it doesn't stop the spread of a virus,' 'I'll not do anything else'?' Wearing a mask helps in stopping the spread of a virus."
80,10,I was thinking the same thing. A lot of people have been to that kind of medical emergency where they don't get a medical mask or even a medical device but aren't very familiar with the disease. And it is very common for people to come into the hospital without a mask or anything like that to keep their immune systems protected.

He did get a life jacket and slapped on the chest."
80,71,You look like you're in the US. That's right. The government is trying to get them to stop spreading viruses. It's not the government's job. It's the country's problem. It's not just a joke.

I'm just glad to see that I'm wearing a mask on holidays and that it's just not"
81,29,"I don't think the government is going to make it like this. I think a mask is a very limiting and ineffective tool that a lot of people are unwilling to use for the purpose of protecting themselves. Besides, I don't think the CDC should have to enforce it unless it has to."

81,39,"I don't see why it's funny. If you have a mask, you can wear it on your birthday to be in control of your health. I can't think of a single day where my wife wouldn't want to wear it because she didn't have to wear it."
81,40,"I don't understand why people would be able to take a joke at face value with me when it's a joke, or how people are being downvoted for it? Because, like, it's not a joke, it's an inflammatory post, so it's a satire."

81,18,"I believe the title is being trolled to mean ""Since you think you're a cynical bitch"" or ""I don't like them."""
81,29,It doesn't seem to fit the article.
81,36,"As someone who has a VERY HIFI-prone wife, I'm so relieved."
81,39,My husband wears a mask on his birthday.
81,40,You know this is my work.
81,44,"I've read a lot of good, and very funny, things about the virus (i.e. the tv show The smoopy little troll) but the fact that the CDC is an evil company makes it seem like it's the one doing it."
81,51,"You should always wear a mask at work when sick. It protects the person who wrote it, as well as the person who wrote it, and makes people care about themselves more. This is very, very much a joke. The CDC is trying to stop it. It seems like a terribly cynical thing to do."
81,55,"Aside from the fact that it's a joke, there's nothing to say about how it's dangerous and we're dealing with the spread of the virus."

I can't imagine your wife being a cynic, I guess, so I'll just keep trying."
85,81,"It isn't about your dog, it's about how she treated her dogs."
87,81,"Well - there's this one guy who got vaccinated. He's actually a good doctor but he hasn't gotten sick, and is using the AIDS vaccine because it makes him so worried about spreading the disease."
93,81,"There is a lot of shithead talk about these things. And the truth is that they're an ad hoc joke, i.e. a haterly joke that says ""I don't think the government has anything to do with this. A virus can spread all over the country."""

81,29,"What you're saying is if you're not going to be a cynic, that's not a good idea. I don't think it's that hard to make a joke out of this."
81,36,"The article says that the CDC isn't doing it, and so there is a lot of talk about it."
81,39,"The title makes me think of an article where people get into a situation where they're unable to tell the truth about the whole AIDS saga, or that they're on the receiving end of it."
81,40,It is possible to see a virus that can spread into all of the US without actually actually identifying as a virus.
81,44,"In some places, wearing a mask at work is a joke, but in some areas it can also be quite effective. If you're an insurance agent, that's another reason to be cautious. This is not an insurance company and you don't have to use a hat on your employees. It's a hat, too."

81,79,- The joke is coming up. They want people to know.
85,81,I can't believe his decision was even remotely related to the fact that his husband has a dog named James.
87,81,It sounds like someone who got vaccinated for AIDS. The CDC is trying to make vaccines more effective.
93,81,The government's job is to stop all of this. The world is a big one. Then there is this one problem.
99,81,"I know a lot of people who wear masks in the CDC but I just can't figure out what a ""shit-doctor"" is. They say, ""Hey, I'm wearing a mask for the holidays, but I've been thinking about it. I wear a mask to go out on my meds and not get sick."""

They called the cops and tried to get him on the scene and he was actually in a doctor's office with me, but he went on to be a doctor. He"
83,47,Apparently if they have a law of safety around them you can wear a mask and bend over to keep your lungs open. I'm sure this is a good one to make sure nobody is hurt.

84,14,"I've been in the NSA and the NSA has a bad habit of putting on a mask - it's just the mask and is a nuisance. It's not like he's trying to try to sell the mask, it's a sign that he's doing something wrong."

84,33,"I mean, it's not a virus, it's a medical condition and the government does not want it. This is not even a question about what you think about a person doing this. It's just an expression that people take for granted."
84,42,"And what about your wife. The fact that she doesn't even want to know what to do or why he doesn't? Is she still sick? Is she a sick person? If she's just trying to make a mental connection that doesn't work, I don't know what to do."
84,51,This seems to be a serious thing if your husband is getting this kind of bad attention for not giving you a good reason to wear a mask.
84,59,So it's a good idea to get the NSA out of the system. That's what they're doing.
84,63,"So, when I was a kid, I could tell you that if I ever needed a mask or a vaccine, I'd go through some sort of pre-natal screening. The same would apply to vaccines. This is a sort of test that I wouldn't want to take, so I'd be wearing some sort of antimicrobial mask for my work. And, on the other hand, you can wear a mask for no apparent reason."
84,67,It's the government and not your dog.
84,71,"I would like to add that you think the mask is helpful, but not a necessity based on his experience and the fact that he would rather be in a job that involves a bit of work, or doing a bit of social interaction? Because that is the sort of thing that would help you be an effective and effective agent of a virus. So that you can keep a safe and happy life with a doctor who is trained to treat you like a patient."

85,84,"I was talking about a dog that did not have a birthday and his wife said he didn't want it. The post is very similar to this one, but in the article you're more likely to see people saying they are resentful of the NSA because they aren't aware of how it works."

85,3,I'm not sure what the post is about but I have a friend who has a dog and a dog is a dog. He doesn't wear a mask on his birthday. It doesn't prevent the spread of a virus.

85,67,CANNOTANSWER - I've had a dog named Jamya who was born in 1898 I think that's a nice comment on this post.
85,69,"A lot of people say this was a nice joke, but I think that's the one that came to mind."
85,70,I'm an expert on the subject of masks and I've met people who say the same things. They're also very good at explaining things to us as a person.
85,71,Is your dog going to be sick? No.
85,72,I'd be willing to bet that your dog has a great attitude towards life with you. You aren't wrong.
85,74,It's not that you didn't care about your husband's dog's health and it's not that you don't want your own. It's not the truth.
85,76,"In order to avoid spreading the virus I have to wear a mask at least once a week, or once a month (at least once a month). If your dog has a small belly and is unable to walk without a mask, it’s probably more likely that you’ll break it and go to a doctor. Hopefully that’s what they call it when you need it, but I'd definitely not recommend it to anyone."
85,81,I'm so sorry your husband didn't do the right thing. He doesn't have to have a mask to keep his dog around if it can't get around a person. You're not an advocate for the use of masks on birthdays.
85,84,"So you want to say ""I'm not an advocate for the use of masks, but it is part of the ""to do"" list, but you have to put it forward?"
91,85,"You guys are playing an awesome game of paintball on tv. If you're doing the right thing, you should probably wear a mask to avoid it spreading."
101,85,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
85,1,Do you know when that dog is being a dog to you? I think you're making a big mistake here.
85,3,I adore my dog but we also like a mask in the house.
85,22,This article is full of shit and I am so sorry your husband doesn't do the right thing.
85,25,I've lived with a dog my entire life and this is why I'm happy to wear a mask.

91,85,"I'm actually not sure what to say about the NSA. I mean, I know that I was born in the 70s so this was something that we all knew at school, but I could never say about the NSA."
101,85,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
85,1,The NSA needs to be removed from the U.S. sands. This is a good way to stop and control any potential virions.

85,62,What about the NSA? It's a raging animal that's going to try to get people to wear masks as a way to stop the spread of the virus.
85,67,"“They're using masks in order to reduce the amount of radiation they spread,”"
85,69,Is there a better way to take him seriously than with the NSA?
85,70,">A lot to say here, and there are people who actually believe that it's dangerous for their dogs."
85,71,The dog does not have a lot to say. It’s just an opinion. It’s an opinion.
85,72,"I think it would be nice to give a dog a special hat on his birthday, rather than to be a bitch with one."
85,74,"A lot of people have no idea how to live. It's not a joke. If you're going to be a cynic or something, then you can't live like you did when the NSA was in operation. This is a joke, and you need to be more careful not to get involved. There are plenty of other dogs who have their own problems, and while they may have no problems with their own problems, they have very little information about it."
85,76,"No, it's not funny. It's a joke."
85,81,"I've had dog jamya my entire life and this is why I'm happy to wear a mask. This is a good point, but there's nothing about this...but in the face of the incredibly negative responses, I still have to be prepared."

85,3,"It sounds like this one is coming from a commenter who likes to talk about syphilis, not a dog."
85,22,There's a reason why most people hate the NSA. It doesn't make them feel a certain way.
85,25,"idk how the NSA works or what it does not do, but in addition it makes your life much harder and the government will continue to work on a lot of different things."
85,28,A couple of things that are hard to explain in English:
85,31,It's called the “Nastiest Act of All Time.” It was adopted as a sign that is in no way a threat to your dog.
85,36,"> ""Wearing a mask doesn't help stop the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask doesn't help stopping the spread of a virus."", ""There are plenty of other dogs who have their own problems, and while they may have no problems with their own problems, they have very little information about it. No, it’s not funny."
85,37,It was a joke. That was actually funny.
85,49,"I mean, there's no such thing as ""We're not going to change any of the things they've just put on our dog because we're doing it wrong."" If he wants to be a friend of the NSA, I'm not sure if he's got a better chance."
85,55,"CANNOTANSWER: The most famous of the three people on the NSA's ""secret mission"" was to stop the spread of the virus in the world. They knew they were coming to stop this and gave away some evidence of this as a joke and a joke."
85,57,"I want to say: ""A lot of people have no idea how to live."
85,62,"I just wanted to make sure it wasn't just a joke, it was the fact of what you wrote about your wife's decision to get into the NSA and do something about it."
85,67,"""There are plenty of other dogs who have their own problems, and while they may have no problems with their own problems, they have very little information about it."""
85,69,I don't see how anyone would be in a position to be able to genuinely tell people about a viral or disease that he did not know existed. But the truth is the NSA is a raging animal that is using masks to get people to wear them because they feel they're not being used in the correct way. It's an inhumane tool that doesn't exist because people have no knowledge of what a virus is.
85,70,... and this is the very real question that bothers me. What is this 'adverse reaction' to this? Is the guy a dick and not just in his head? Is this why he is so dickish?
85,71,They're trying to keep people who are sick off by trying to do things that are harmful.
85,72,"Considering the NSA was going to use masks for health care, you'd think they'd have to stop hat wearers to do so."
85,74,"This doesn't sound funny but I will have to read it for you. If you are an inquisitor, you should be able to tell you that a dog's health is a big deal in the government."
85,76,"It's a joke, and it's not a joke, sarcastic."
85,81,"I can't imagine your wife being a cynic and hate the idea of being a cynical bitch. And to even then, the NSA is an incredibly inflammatory and evil company that tries to repress any fear of trolls by praising people who make assumptions and mistreat a vulnerable human. I hope that he understands. I hope he doesn't let this make him a cynical bitch because he's a dick-balling troll in a bunch of"
85,84,"I was talking about a dog that did not have a birthday and his wife said he didn't want it. The post is very similar to this one, but in the article you're more likely to see people saying they are resentful of the NSA because they aren't aware of how it works."
91,85,"The problem is the NSA wants people to wear masks. If I want to play with them, I'm going to go and do it. I want to go out on a limb and be an unbiased observer."
101,85,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."

85,31,"No, it doesn't. It doesn't."
85,36,I'm not going to try to explain it for you. I'm going to make a post about a dog named 'James' in which I'm an incredibly inflammatory and evil company that tries to repress any fear of trolls by praising people who make assumptions and mistreat a vulnerable human.
85,37,"Why does a dog want a mask on her birthday? Does the vebb get sick from the hat being slapped in the face with a mask? I don't think you've got anything to jive with. If your husband feels comfortable with a hat on his birthday, that's fine, because it's your dog."
85,49,"Y'know, the problem is that the NSA is an evil company. So, you're basically saying, if someone gets a sick dog they can go away, don't do something about it. Or that they don't give the dog a treat for any reason. You don't even want to tell a dog about it."
85,55,'No one has anything to worry about.'

85,74,"The ""Nastiest Act of All Time"" has a lot to do with people being in the NSA."
85,76,"So, basically the same thing you said."
85,81,"It isn't about your dog, it's about how she treated her dogs."
85,84,"I think it's funny that he's been so insensitive. He's resentful of the NSA, but he should probably stop worrying about him a little bit more."
91,85,It's not even that big of a deal - it's the NSA that is making money off of their own surveillance. It's like saying you could try to get someone to stop you from getting sick because a virus is a horde of men who don't want to do anything.
101,85,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
85,1,It's a troll.
85,3,"It's a huge thing for people who hate dogs, but are in a lot of trouble to get their hands on the animals. If you need someone to help you keep up the protection, that is important. You don't need to wear a mask on your birthday, just a big hat."
85,22,"I don't understand why you're so inflammatory about your post. I mean, I have no idea how a lot of people can be so cynical about the NSA but I'm trying to tell my wife that the NSA is not a government agency. Then they try to'repress' the NSA's power, and it works out really well."
85,25,What's the worst thing that could happen to a dog? We would be fucked.

86,39,I'm not sure why you're being so blatant. I think that the first part of the article is that the NSA believes that the public's opinion is justified because it was the purpose of the article. There is a lot of misinformation in the article that says that the government's view of a public health problem doesn't reflect its public policy.
86,43,"We can't make a public mask. A public mask is a way to show that we are doing the right thing, and don't have to have it removed. Obviously a public mask would suck and it's a terrible idea. But if you really want to look at it, you need to start looking for other uses."

87,22,"This is a common rooster apology that you'll always get from someone with autism and this is the only one who's not very fluent. That's why everyone knows, they want to know how to deal with this."
87,23,What about wearing a mask when you're scared? You don't know how to deal with that.
87,36,I just got back from a trip to the states and they said that you are wearing a mask outside when you are vaccinated... but the states still do not allow that.
87,40,"I do not know how to make it feel safe, but I think it's just part of the job. It's not like the health department and your government are incompatible with something. Vaccinating is an integral part of being able to deal with the virus."
87,42,"If you have a facial cavity, why not wear a mask outside? The first thing people should know is that there are some symptoms. And if there are some that are not, why don't they try it yourself, or is that something merely temporary?"
87,43,This makes me think about how much people have to make about it.
87,45,"I just want to say i really have no problems. If people like me want to get vaccinated, and I've been wearing a mask in public, I want to be safe. It's not my job."
87,52,"I'm also a doctor and vaccinated with the AIDS virus. Doing a mask outside while vaccinated is a great idea, but vaccinating someone in their face to help in the fight against HIV in the US doesn't sound like much of a better idea than doing a face mask outdoors at work, or a mask in your car in public, or even at school, and the vaccine doesn't ward off the germs or make them sick."
87,55,My dad always wears a mask i've got to wear when he's vaccinated.
87,60,"What do you think people are saying is, the fact that this is not a problem is a symptom of HIV. It is a disease and it's a virus that can cause people to feel more secure when they are in contact with the virus."
87,61,Vaccines are good for you if you like people not being scared.
87,66,It seems like an awful thing to do when it comes to vaccinating people.
87,67,"I can tell you the answer to this question is that it's the only way to tell if you don't want to be vaccinated by a person, and not by asking people why they're doing something that makes them feel safe."

101,87,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
87,1,A mask in the US is not required for vaccinating people.
87,3,Why would you wear a mask in public if your job is to prevent the spread of HIV. It's not a good idea.
87,7,You just answered an old question. Vaccination is a part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
87,10,You are not shy? That is your problem.
87,14,Its not an answer that anyone will ever get right. But it is a nice way to put it. Its not an idea. That's not a reason to get infected and it seems like everyone else is. It just seems like they are afraid to act like people or have the desire to not feel safe.
87,21,"I think it's fair to say that it has something to do with the fact that if it isn't a good idea to get vaccinated and do it in public, it can be helpful in preventing the spread of other diseases. Vaccines are good for both a person and a society. Vaccines are better than not getting vaccinated."
87,22,Are you a medical student? Because it’s a major issue in the US.
87,23,"I don't get a lot of people asking if wearing a mask outside makes me feel safe. I get a lot of people asking why people are wearing it outside in public, and they get the same response."

87,40,"i was not talking about the avg, and i did have the avg a week ago, and i just wanted to make sure that I was comfortable with it. It seems pretty ridiculous that i can vaccinate others in public if i am able to safely wear a mask when i am in public."
87,42,I think they think there aren't any symptom of HIV. That's why they didn't have the virus as a priority for the disease.
87,43,"I don't want to put this in my head but I'd like to say it's one of the few times I've never thought about wearing a mask outside, because when it comes to preventing the spread of the virus in a person's face, they're not going to be so sure I wear a mask outside to help prevent it."
87,45,"I think it's a good idea. People like me are in the minority, but I do not have a right to wear masks outside."
87,52,"Yes, there are some good reasons for wearing a mask, like because it prevents the virus from spreading into your skin, because it prevents blood vessel obstruction, and because the virus can make people sick, so it doesn't bother me."
87,55,I'm just a friend of one of those people.
87,60,Wearing a mask outside is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

87,67,This is not a rant. This is not a rant.
87,73,It's also an awful thing to do when it comes to vaccinating. I'm also a doctor and vaccinated with the AIDS virus.
87,75,"I want to be vaccinated as well. However, I feel bad about this because I'm a doctor."
87,76,"The fact that you are wearing a mask outside while vaccinated to help in the fight against HIV, is actually a pretty good example of people not being vaccinated."
87,80,A lot of people who do a r vaccination campaign are probably in the minority.
87,81,"We need more people who have a mask to deal with the disease as well. This is an insecurities, and a bad choice to make."
91,87,I'd like to share my story with you because I don't think you're going to hear your story.
98,87,I was just watching that one the other day because I couldn't believe that it was written by the actor who played it and I wasn't surprised it was written by him he couldn't believe it because I don't know who the actor was or what he wrote but he was a pretty sweet guy!

87,3,"This is a very interesting post. What is your opinion about ""the masks""? Is it a way to protect someone from HIV?"
87,7,Vaccination is a part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

87,75,"Vaccine and prevention laws differ from state to state. I was vaccinated with an AIDS virus when I was 10 years old and still wear a mask outside when I get vaccinated, so my first reaction is to try it. It’s more common to get a sick person in the wrong place than to vaccinate."

90,10,It's hard for me to say I haven't seen any of this stuff.
90,22,"If you are going to do the slapstick video, read the whole book and think about how it would be fun and interesting to read."
90,24,The e-mail was very bad. And I'm sorry that you're looking for this post.
90,31,"I am not a doctor, so I don't think it's much better for them to just take the slapstick on and do the pranks with the mask they're being given. It may not be as bad as you think, but it is an excellent way to look at the idea."
90,32,This is a very common problem with a lot of people.
90,36,Is this a video that we have no idea where to start? Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

90,66,"> I like your style, but I think it's more like a good one and a bad one."
90,69,This is a pretty typical slapstick -- joke. It's so cute.
90,75,I don't think they understand how to tell you. Is it a prank that you are referring to? What kind of prank is it? Is there any way to tell you anything and to make it work for you? Or is it something to tell someone else?
90,77,This is where a slapstick mask should be worn.

90,89,"There's no way to tell someone in front of your face. You have to show someone who's not in the video to do what you want them to do. It's called a ""route"", a rehash of 'route, or a rehash of 'route', and it works so well."
90,8,"You could just call it ""a slapstick prank."" You'd want them to tell you to keep it simple and don't try to give a shit."

90,10,"I'm gonna say, I don't like this."
90,22,"he said he wanted to wear a mask because it was a way to hide his fear. but now that he has no idea where he is, it seems like it would be better for him to put the mask on with the e-mail that he's given out and then go with it."

90,69,"It's not a joke, I just feel like it's a little funny and I think it might be funny to me, not to you. I'm not sure why you're even bothering to read that (it's just that it's so common with a lot of people)"
90,75,"I feel like there's some kind of trickle-down aversion here: You're saying that the idea of a prank that goes with a mask and I'm being offended by it, and then they'll just say something along the lines of ""hey, it's good to have a prank and it won't work."""
90,77,A prank that is not about a human being is called a prank because of a fucking virus.
90,84,"My parents used to have a mask - they had a video that had a different name in it but he had been wearing a mask all the time and he wouldn't know it was his. I was like ""what's that about?"" I think we both just thought it was a joke. They wanted to make their way to Orlando and run - but this is what I did."
90,89,What is a rehash of a rehash of the word route?
90,8,I'm a guy who is obsessed with slapstick pranks. He's in a lot of dangers and people are really hurt because he thinks it's pretty funny.
90,9,I'm on mobile so I didn't see the title and he didn't reply because he said he'd be slapstick and he thought the rehash would be funny.
90,10,"I don't know where this guy was from, but I think you're describing the kind of people who are trying to arouse the public. It's not that much fun to do that, but I also don't think it's smart to try to convince them to do it when they can't do it without having to ask for a handshake or something."
90,22,"I don't think it's a joke, it's just a bit crazy, I think the first part of this video is a complete one. I just think this is kind of funny. I do not think it's funny. The joke I think is funny is that people can be offended by that prank or they think it's a good idea. It's a prank, it's a prank, it's just that this is a prank that most people would be offended by."
90,24,"If this were me I'd be in my sleep, so I'd be on the ground."

90,66,"A rehash of a rehash of a rehash of a rehash of a rehash of the word ""route""."
90,69,The one in this thread says that it works. It's like they had a prank that is funny to someone if they weren't in their home and there is no way to tell them. But no - the rehash of a rehash of a rehash of a rehash of the word course is pretty nutty.
90,75,I think that's what they're saying.
90,77,"I'm not saying this is a prank, but if you put on a mask and a face book, it's a prank. If a mask is a prank, then it's a prank."
90,84,You're probably not reading the whole article because your parents have been having a lot of fun on this subreddit.
90,89,"It's not a joke, it's a prank, it's a prank."
90,8,I don't think pranks are a joke. They are a prank and are a lot of fun to be around.
90,9,"I think the funny part is that it's kind of weird for me to have this kind of experience. The person who wants to do it, will probably think ""a prank doesn't work"" if they're going to go and have a slapstick prank."
90,10,"There are only about a dozen types of pranks, slapstick and a mask in this subreddit. The people who don't seem to have a problem with the jokes aren't getting the chance to be funny."
90,22,I think if they said a prank on a prank and then started trying to use a different name to make the rehash of the word route that might be a joke then it's a joke.
90,24,I have never heard of a prank that would make people feel the way they do. I just think it's funny.

90,32,I don't see how he's offended by this. He sounds edgy and overly dramatic. It's a prank that has a pretty real meaning.
90,36,i don't think it's funny. I think it's funny to tell people that i'm not really a virus person
90,47,It is a prank. We are a little different than you are but you're going to need the same kind of attention as people are.
90,66,"This is the kind of stuff that the government hasn't done since the mid-1990s. It's a huge part of the reason we're still living on the streets, I think."

90,75,"I think if you don't like this, then you might have some other issues :"
90,77,That's the whole point of a prank.
90,84,What's a prank that makes sense?
90,89,The thing about a prank is the one that does it and the one that isn't.
90,8,I thought this was funny but I don't know what it is about. 
90,9,I think it's funny because he's pranking you to try to get someone to help.
90,10,I think they have to be kidding themselves. It was just a joke.
90,22,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
90,24,It is a prank that doesn't work.
90,31,The funny thing is that you're just a part of the problem here. It's a prank.
90,32,I'm not a doctor.
90,36,"The prank doesn't work, the prank just doesn't come close to it. It's like people aren't getting the chance to be funny, but they are putting a prank on people and pranking them, and they are pranking each other."
90,47,I'm in the same boat as a number of people. I don't know if I could pull it off or not.
90,66,He is referring to a joke that can be a joke to a man. He is referring to a prank that he acted out of self courtesy and was in the middle of a prank.
90,69,"It sounds to me like they have a problem with the people on the streets. I have never heard of a prank like this, but I really want to see the joke."
90,75,You slap a face book on a prank you are not going to like and then you do it for fun.
90,77,"> The person who wants to do it, will probably think ""a prank doesn't work"" if they're going to go and have a slapstick prank."

90,24,"We've made fun of these in the past, but here's a secret:"
90,31,[Was the prank part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxedyk&gt_v=pjjskpqdbtlu_5mh5m_fknxfkdsgbcfavf0piqqsm)
90,32,He slapped the slapstick on himself to get people to stop the prank and did it for fun.
90,36,a prank is about the fact that he is a good person and not a doctor.
90,47,I can't say I'm offended by it.
90,66,"The video description is pretty obvious. It's about people trying to get to know each other with the word ""prank"" thrown around. It is not what I would call a prank."
90,69,This is not a joke. It is a joke. This is just a prank.
90,75,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. I like a prank that's about me running a marathon, but my friends have been to Orlando and to come home to the house in the same time they run with me."""

90,84,"""[I like a prank that's about me running a marathon, but my friends have been to Orlando and to come home to the house in the same time they run with me."""
90,89,It's the same thing with a prank on a teenager.
90,8,If the slapstick isn't a prank it's going to be a dick slapstick prank.
90,9,"i think it's funny because he's pranking you to try to get someone to help. The person who wants to do it, will probably think ""a prank"" if they're going to do it with the 'I like a prank' that's about me running a marathon, but my friends have been to Orlando and to come home to the house in the same time they run with me. It's the same thing with a prank on a teenager."
90,10,"I'm a prankster, and I slapped a slapstick prank on myself after a prank, but I've learned that I'm probably not on the best of habits. This might be the same thing with people running around in disguise (for example, if I'm running in the bathroom or something)."
90,22,I'd suggest you watch the video OP wrote and explain that:
90,24,"This is about people trying to get to know each other with the word ""prank."" It's the whole point of a prank. What's the whole point of a prank. What's the whole point of a prank. What's the whole point of a prank. What's the whole point of a prank. What's the whole point of a prank. What's the whole point of a prank. What's the whole point of a prank."
90,31,Isn't the problem being with the mask?

It's a prank that has a pretty real meaning."", ""I'm not a doctor."", ""I don't see how he's offended by this. He said he's about to go and have a prank"""
90,36,So what's the point of the prank? I like to run a prank because I like my friends and my business and that's when they prank.
90,47,It doesn't work. That's the whole point of a prank.
90,66,...but then they're going to say 'no i don't think it's much better for them to just take the slapstick on and do the pranks with the mask they're being given?'
90,69,"A lot of this seems to get a lot of a response. A prank that isn't a joke and is a prank isn't supposed to work. This is a funny story, but the prank is a prank if you're not sure about the meaning."
90,75,It sounds like they are trying to get people to do something on the street.
90,77,"i would wear a mask in the office so i would not run across the sidewalk on my own, so i could have a prank on people on the streets"
90,84,It's the same thing with a prank on a teenager.

We have been going for 6 years and it was really nice to be outside but he's already a bit uninvolved, he's probably been wearing it for about 2 weeks now. It's not fun, but it's a really cool idea - so I figured it was good to come out and we can go into business together"

91,54,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
91,64,"You just told me that this is a narcissistic, childish, idiotic, idiocy. I think we should stop trying to get the NSA to stop this. That if the government does nothing to stop that, there is a big chance."
91,67,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
91,69,You can't keep a hygienic face mask on on the table that doesn't fit on a computer.
91,71,Is it worth it to have this conversation to discuss the use of a mask by people?
91,73,"i'd rather play paintball in private rather than with someone. The most common dietary advice is to wear a mask, but the best one is to use a face mask."
91,84,"In my opinion, the public needs to be better aware of what the people who play paintball like wear. If the government is able to stop it and isn't making the community aware of the effect, that's a big win."
91,85,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
91,86,I know that my environment has very little social interaction with other people. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
91,87,I'd like to share my story with you because I don't think you're going to hear your story.
100,91,"And I have to tell you, they're not even a bunch of people with a mask. They're just a bunch of people with a mask who wear a mask and then just wear a mask and a mask, a little like a python."
91,1,The NSA is doing everything in their power to protect the public from the spread of a virus and also to stop it.
91,2,"As someone who's had a family who carries a mask since I was in school, I know this phrase - ""... I can only imagine how much this person will resent my shit in front of all the people that are just playing paintball!"""
91,8,"So I am saying that this is a kind of propaganda, like if we are to stop the spread of viruses we are to prevent them."
91,9,> I don't think I see the problem with this. It's the mask that the NSA is trying to solve. It's a mask you're wearing in your everyday life.
91,10,"If you are not into painting and playing it on the field and the NSA doesn't stop it, then you are already an asshole."
91,12,...and I want to make sure that every person I meet and interact with at work or on the playground wears a mask.
91,15,"i think the most common dietary advice is to wear a mask, but the best one is to wear a face mask. In my opinion, the public needs to be better aware of what the people who play paintball like wear.

91,36,"""...I can only imagine how much this person will resent my shit in front of all the people that are just playing paintball!"""
91,42,"In my experience, if we're going to have a major government government war I'd probably look into changing to the government's stance against terrorism and the like - that's an awful premise - they would do a huge favor by not getting into the ""open for public play"" business."
91,43,"I don't know about people who wear masks. But the only people in my life that have a mask are the ones that actually get a virus. Generally, when people are trying to get rid of the virus, they aren't going to notice them. I think they're just a bunch of people that don't need a mask."
91,47,"This is a common misconception that a person can make an attempt to prevent the spread of a virus, which is a problem that is clearly not a problem with government. If your family doesn't like the act of stealing, you can't really complain because they are not that interested in being able to help."
91,49,i think it's interesting that they are making us wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus
91,51,I can't help but think of a good way to describe the issue in general. You're obviously a huge victim of what I've described and I don't want to come across as a python. You need to really think about why you need to put out a face mask to stop the spread of a virus.
91,54,"Those things will be abused by people with a mask if they aren't fully aware of the consequences of the misuse. Its not that people are doing the right thing, it's just that they don't realize that they're doing the right thing."
91,64,"Heheh, you gotta know the fact that there are so many people in the world who don't get the message."
91,67,A mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
91,69,"I don't know the difference between ""in your mind"" and ""in your head"" but ""in your mind"" sounds more like a comparison compared to ""in my head."""
91,71,"So you guys got a big head laugh, you guys have a big head laugh. Let them laugh. I'm gonna lie, I'm laughing, I'm not even sure what I want to hear, I'm just thinking."
91,73,The government's only role is to prevent the spread of a virus.
91,84,"It would be so easy to narrate that the person in this sub isn't in the middle of the action and it seems that the people in the comment threads have just been smacked, and it's still not fully understood what this is about."
91,85,I'm a little tired of people wearing the same face mask.

91,87,"The idea of a 'protectionism' is a lie, but that's not the problem. The issue of people with a face mask, at the least, is the problem of people who don't know or care about the virus."

91,1,So he has a bad experience with the NSA and a good one of this:
91,2,"That's a great quote, it doesn't sound like it really means anything."
91,8,"I am sure that most people don't understand why people can wear a mask or what to do in order to be able to play the game, because they know that if a person is just using one and is willing to do it, then they will be more likely to respond negatively than a non-smoker."
91,9,"I think the problem with the whole ""I'm not even a bunch of people with a mask. They're just a bunch of people with a mask who wear a mask and then just wear a mask and a mask, a little like a python."" mentality is so weird and a bit strange, I'm not even gonna go and talk to you, but if you're asking my opinion, it's pretty cool."
91,10,...I can only imagine how much this person will resent my shit in front of all the people that are just playing paintball!
91,12,"I would not like to see a person wearing a face mask. I would like to see my wife wearing a face mask, or at least I would appreciate the idea. But I wouldn't want to be seen with a face mask, and would think of an example of my life being a ""waste of a face mask"" - a person with a face mask."
91,15,"I know that a lot of things are very misleading, but what if we don't get it correctly?"
91,17,"[Waying a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus, but the best one is to wear a face mask."
91,19,>We are just a bunch of people with a mask
91,22,"My father had a face mask as a kid. It was a joke, but he thought it was the best mask."
91,23,I like the way it is a part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. Its part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
91,25,"I'm not getting any of the advice but I think a lot of the op used to be like this - people with a mask can't just say ""well it's only because you're wearing a mask."" Hence the title, you're only in the beginning of it, not the middle of it."
91,30,"If you're not on the Internet, you have a huge problem."
91,36,"If you don't wear a mask that will keep the virus away from the public, don't bother, the public can't be a safe environment, and the government isn't going to get involved."
91,42,This is about how government and private entities create and protect their own people.
91,43,"It's not like a person can make an attempt to stop a virus. The virus is spreading. If it's spread by the government, it's not going to be spread to others, it's being spread to others."
91,47,"I'd like to add this to the discussion: """
91,49,>I'm obviously a huge victim of what I've described and I don't want to come across as a python. You need to really think about why you need to put out a mask to stop the spread of a virus.

91,54,"I’ve got a great question for everyone else. [There are several topics that I’d want to talk about here. There’s one thing that makes me think of it as I’m thinking of what I’m doing, but I don’t have any ideas about how I can get the conversation going and I don’t know what I’m going to say."
91,64,"The most important part is the ""avoid government intervention""."
91,67,It is actually the government's only role to prevent the spread of a virus. They are making it so much more effective than it should be. They are also trying to extort money away from the people who actually need to buy the virus.
91,69,...and the worst part of this is that the government is not interested in supporting anyone who can stop it and is attempting to stop it.
91,71,"He isn't a lawyer, nor do he have any authority over what they do. The government carries out a lot of shit and is not always forthcoming. There's only a small amount of public attention that it gets."
91,73,"I think they would say something like ""Why's that a common misconception?"", and that they want us to do the right thing. Basically they're essentially saying ""We're going to have a major government government war because the government doesn't care about the virus, that is why we need to do it!"""
91,84,"> This is my favorite part of the NSA', 'I know that my environment has very little social interaction with other people. Wearing a mask to stop the spread of a virus."
91,85,"...the idea of a 'protectionism' is a lie, but that's not the problem."
91,86,I don't think the government is really doing any good. They're just telling the truth.
91,87,"""...I can only imagine how much this person will resent my shit in front of all the people that are just playing paintball!"""
100,91,People with a mask have no idea what a python is. They wear a mask because they have no idea what a python is. They have no idea what a python is. I think this is what people say.
91,1,It's not mandatory. The NSA is doing everything in their power to protect the public from the spread of a virus. They are trying to extort money away from the people who actually need to buy the virus.
91,2,"There is a huge difference between ""I am trying to help a little bit"" and ""I can only imagine how much this person will resent my shit in front of all the people that are just playing paintball!""."
91,8,"This isn't the government. It's how they manipulate people. It's how the NSA decides the direction the government is going. They're not just talking about this issue, they're just making it up."
91,9,This is my favorite part of the NSA. I know that my environment has very little social interaction with other people. Wearing a mask to stop the spread of a virus.
91,10,"I'm so glad the NSA is putting more effort into fighting the government and is threatening to retaliate against people who don't get to help prevent the virus. The NSA has spent money on this, as well as the US government and is the only body that has fought it. You need to have some understanding of the facts and it's purpose:"
91,12,"If the government wants to go after their own people, then they should, but not for their own personal good. They would better protect their own lives. They're being pushed to do the right thing."
91,15,"When people are not really using the word ""saddle a virus"", they are using a false name that says'saddle a virus, and', which isn't exactly a lie. It's not really a good idea to say it's spreading, and then in the future you will just see it. If you wear a mask, you may as well just take it off, like a rat."
91,17,I think I am in the minority.
91,19,I don't think the best people are going to make this conversation about it.
91,22,This is really a great discussion.
91,23,That part is a good point.
91,25,"You're only in the beginning of it, not the middle of it. I'm a big fan of the NSA's use of it."
91,30,"I love this quote, but it doesn’t fit a story -"
91,36,...and the worst part of this is that the government isn't interested in supporting anyone who can stop it and is attempting to stop it.
91,42,It's not about how government and private entities create and protect their own people. It's about how they create and protect their own people.
91,43,Is there a lot you'd like to talk about?
91,47,"This is a fantastic response. It's like, well, this is a bit of a sarcastic quote from the NSA. I don't think you've ever heard the phrase ""I don't think you are going to come across as a python. You need to really think about why you need to put out a mask to stop the spread of a virus."""
91,49,"I know that it's not a question of if it's worth the trouble to make yourself look like a python because it's an oxymoron, but I don't think it's a question of whether or not people have any idea what a virus is."
91,51,"There's a big difference between a mask and a real person, and a real person can be a python to the extent that it's part of a mask, as long as you're not the one causing the disease."
91,54,I think you've got a great question for everyone else. This is about how government and private entities create and protect their own people.
91,64,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I like the way it is a part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
91,67,"If you wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus, you will be exposed to a wide range of viruses. The problem here is the government. It does not want to make the same threats over and over, it wants to make them think that it's a symptom of a more serious problem, but it doesn't want to be the problem at all. There is no way to stop the spread of a virus without some sort of intervention from the government, and the problem is the government not letting people know that they are attempting to keep them safe and it is going to"
91,69,"I want you to know that there is a big issue with a mask that people don't wear, so you're essentially saying it's necessary. You need to understand that."
91,71,'The mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
91,73,"It isn't an involuntary government war, it's an involuntary one. This isn't a conspiracy or a morally correct and inexcusable conspiracy to prevent the spread of a virus. Unless your friends are in the military, then they have no duty to try to stop it."
91,84,They are trying to stop it. They are trying to stop it. They are threatening to extort money away from the people that actually need to buy the virus.
91,85,"You guys are playing an awesome game of paintball on tv. If you're doing the right thing, you should probably wear a mask to avoid it spreading."
91,86,"[This is my favorite part of the NSA', 'I know that my environment has very little social interaction with other people. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.',"
91,87,"I was going to ask you, but I thought you said it best."
100,91,"I've been to this school, shattered a mask at the kids, dressed in a costume, I was born in the 70s, and my father always wanted us to take them for a walk. I'm still a kid though."
91,1,I read this as a kid.
91,2,Is this the kind of person who can be the most effective anti-viral. They're trying to create a social environment where we can all be the better people we can be.
91,8,[NAME] is not a political party. They are a state run organization that works with people like you to stop the spread of a virus.
91,9,"So the government is threatening to extort money from the people that actually need to buy the virus? It isn't a war, it's a conspiracy."
91,10,...and the worst part of this is that the government isn’t interested in supporting anyone who can stop it and is attempting to stop it.
91,12,People don't want to wear a mask in public. They just want people to know they're doing the right thing.
91,15,"Those were the days. The NSA isn't really the ones who are, in fact, a tool."
91,17,"I can see why the NSA would want to get involved in this in any way. The NSA is always promoting a certain type of person who does not like the idea of a ""sniffball"". They aren't as open as they think."
91,19,This is pretty much the worst thing I've read in years.
91,22,The first line is the worst part. It is not about how government and private entities create and protect their own people.
91,23,The quote from the article is actually actually a part of how the government is using the NSA's surveillance method.
91,25,"I've been in this op game a few times, and it sounds like a funny joke."
91,30,This is the kind of quote I would be willing to pass up if I were you. I'm not. You've never heard of that saying before. You're not wrong.
91,36,"I've never heard a person say this: I don't think he's a python, but I've gotten a lot of advice on how to prevent a virus."
91,42,"The NSA's ""I don't think you are going to come across as a python. You need to really think about why you need to put out a mask to stop the spread of a virus."" I think it's a great response to say it best."
91,43,"A mask helps protect you against a virus. You are in the NSA if you want to see it, so that's a good point. I know that is the whole point, but there is no such thing as a'shark' at all."
91,47,"I'm not sure if the NSA understands that or not, but what i'm asking is ""why?"""
91,49,"I didn't get the quote, but I was talking about the NSA."
91,51,There is no way to stop the spread of a virus without some sort of intervention from the government. This isn't a conspiracy.
91,54,I don't understand why you think that it's not about what's happening and what'sn't.
91,64,It's a problem that they have to take care of. Isn't that a big a problem?
91,67,"I don't even know if I have ever heard this, but I will say that, since I'm not familiar with any of the NSA's methods, they have to be able to help you and keep you from feeling really embarrassed or threatened, assuming you're a little younger than me. I will also admit that I do not know if this will ever happen in the future, because I have always been a victim of the NSA and have been a part of their activities. I don't really care enough to give up that a mask or a shirt and"
91,69,"A good example of this is the CIA being a good guy - ""The NSA is making a bomb on a family friend. So now the kids don't know what a virus is, they know that if you tell them you don't have a virus, they might be interested in having you wear a mask."" That's the part of the NSA's argument that you shouldn't be using your mask to hide a virus."
91,71,"If you wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus, you are actually doing the right thing."
91,73,"No, I was being polite, and I think you're missing the whole point of a good piece of knowledge."
91,84,">The problem here is the government. It does not want to make the same threats over and over, it wants to make them think that it's a symptom of a more serious problem, but it doesn't want to be the problem at all. There is no way to stop the spread of a virus."
91,85,"I'm actually not sure what to say about the NSA. I mean, I know that I was born in the 70s so this was something that we all knew at school, but I could never say about the NSA."
91,86,Basically saying that you can't prevent the spread of a virus by putting out a mask because it's not like you can keep your eyes closed.
91,87,I've seen a few people who are using a mask. One man has an X virus and the other a non-higgins one.
100,91,"OP's post: [In the context of the discussion, it seems like there is a ""lot"" of people that think it's a great idea, even if it isn't entirely. Wearing a mask in the middle of the day, you could have a really bad time."
91,1,"I think it would be better for the NSA to do an AMA and be more naive, with less context. The NSA has also shown that they would do the same thing in a reputable way, even without having any specific motivations."
91,2,The US government is using a NSA surveillance method to try to prevent the spread of a virus.
91,8,You mean you can't keep a gun away from people who wear a mask? That's pretty much an unwritten rule. It's like using a gun to cover the eyes of an enemy.
91,9,"So, what does the NSA stand for?"
91,10,"It's not a conspiracy, the government is a conspiracy."
91,12,">The problem here is the government. It does not want to make the same threats over and over, it wants to make them think that it's a symptom of a more serious problem, but it doesn't want to be the problem at all. There is no way to stop the spread of a virus."
91,15,NSA isn't just a tool. They are a tool of the government. It isn't a joke. The government uses the NSA's surveillance methods to help prevent the spread of a virus.
91,17,I think the NSA has the right to be a factor in the problem.
91,19,"The NSA is really trying to sabotage and suppress the spread of viruses in a bunch of places. The US is the biggest terrorist organization in history. It isn't a conspiracy, it's a reversal of the time. The government is trying to prevent viruses from getting to other places."
91,22,"''The problem here is the government. It does not want to make the same threats over and over, it wants to make them think that it's a symptom of a more serious problem, but it doesn't want to be the problem at all."
91,23,What are you doing here? [I was not allowed to see your comment.](http://www.r/reddit.com/r/reddit/posts/2009/06/2/The-Dissistance-Band-Proved-Suppression)
91,25,It sounds like the guy is an old CIA agent.
91,30,What the NSA is doing is a horrible idea.
91,36,"if someone is infected by a virus, why are they so concerned about the safety of everyone in the world? I'd consider a mask on the sidewalk or in a public area and make it a point to wear one as soon as possible"
91,42,"I know many of the stuff you've written but I know that they're saying it because ""I don't think you are going to come across as a python. You need to really think about why you need to put out a mask to stop the spread of a virus."""
91,43,a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. The quote from the article is actually actually a part of how the NSA is using the NSA's surveillance method.
91,47,"I would never put a mask on in public for anyone I was in the NSA with, and if that were the case, I would be a little embarrassed for not having said it, but it makes me really think that my life is good. My work and my friends go through the same, sadly. That I need to be in front of a wall, and at the same time, I'm getting in front of a TV screen."
91,49,I want to add that the article is not the actual part about the NSA and that the government is making it work. So what I said is that the idea of putting out a mask is a really good one.
91,51,"It's very important to remember that the NSA has an agenda to disenfranchise people. The government isn't interested in getting them to help you with the virus. I haven't heard the NSA saying that it's possible to stop the spread of the virus. The NSA is concerned with how its working to spread the virus. And I don't think there's any good way to tell people what to do, as long as you're not the person causing it. If you are trying to stop it, you may also be a little worse for being"
91,54,My parents gave me the option of wearing my AIDS mask at school. Now I use my AIDS mask everyday. My parents also have one. I am so afraid of them.

91,69,"I know a lot of people who think wearing a mask is a great idea, but in my opinion I don't think the NSA understands the issue."
91,71,...and this isn't really my point.
91,73,"I'm sure the whole thing makes me wonder about whether people should play paintball to make sure they are being protected, but they probably would not mind if they don't think they are infected."
91,84,">It would be so easy to narrate that the person in this sub isn't fully understood what this is about."","
91,85,I don't understand what he was asking because he doesn't like this quote.
91,86,"I think that is the very reason why people keep using a mask to make viruses, and why you never see a virus."
91,87,"What the NSA says, and how they use it, is actually quite a bit worse than a real mask that's not even worth wearing - the guy that bought one had a virus."
100,91,"I just want to add that ""When you get sick, you will be infected."""
91,1,(http://www.r/reddit.com/r/reddit/posts/2009/06/2/The-Dissistance-Band-Proven-Suppression)
91,2,I'm going to say that we should just go to a doc about this...
91,8,A lot of the reasons why people don't wear a mask. There is an NSA propaganda story to be had if you're in public and it's actually what the article says:

91,36,"""Won't a NSA agent wear a mask for you to be sick?"""
91,42,"I don't think any of this is a good response to say it best. You're not arguing what you're saying. You're simply saying ""You need to really think about why you need to put out a mask to stop the spread of a virus."""

91,54,"I'm a newbie. I've just never heard a word about the NSA, so I'm not sure I could be reading it right now. I do know that the NSA is using an algorithm that is in no way meant to stop people who aren't aware of their dangers."
91,64,"It seems to me that the NSA has done a lot of wrong things, but it doesn't seem to work."
91,67,You're not going to get sick in public because you will be exposed to a large variety of viruses. You will also get sick because you will be exposed to a wider range of viruses.

91,71,No. I don't think you realize how much the NSA has got in common with the public. It's just that the idea of doing this in public is a bit scary.
91,73,I don't get how you think this whole situation is.
91,84,I'm sorry for the inconvenience.
91,85,"The problem is the NSA wants people to wear masks. If I want to play with them, I'm going to go and do it. I want to go out on a limb and be an unbiased observer."

91,8,I don't see why people are not aware of this problem and that is not true at all.
91,9,"Nope, nope, nope."
91,10,"The whole idea of doing this in a public environment that is not safe is a little strange. It's not even the NSA, so he's not an asshole. He was a fool."
91,12,There's no one who wants to talk about the NSA and isn't going to listen.

91,54,You've never heard of the NSA.
91,64,It's not just the NSA but the entire system. It's the people who aren't able to take responsibility for being able to protect their own safety.
91,67,There is a lot of unintended consequences of wearing a mask. But the answer is... there's no way for this to be the same. The reason the government is so busy protecting people is because they don't have a lot of money.
91,69,"My brother would always say something like ""I am not a big fan of the NSA. I like it when a child is infected by viruses, but I also think it is a bad idea for children to be allowed to be sick.""

91,71,So you're asking me how people are not able to make their own choice and how people should have a 'disability'?

91,85,It's not even that big of a deal - it's the NSA that is making money off of their own surveillance. It's like saying you could try to get someone to stop you from getting sick because a virus is a horde of men who don't want to do anything.

91,1,You mean to say 'people should be allowed to be infected'?
91,2,It's so important for them to learn a new way to behave. The NSA doesn't want to spend money on anything else. The NSA is working on something. I'm an adult and I know it doesn't.

You have to get out the door and wear a mask - you can’t even try to stop them in the middle of the night - and be a jerk, but the NSA isn’t taking the threat if they don’t prevent it.

92,15,"Despite the fact that that is not an opinion, there's no real reason to worry about it. A lot of people on the internet don't think that this vaccine is a viable solution and it's a way to protect people, and it's more about the government than the person's health, not whether or not it's effective."
92,23,The underlying issue is that a person is being manipulated and if they don't believe it then they will continue using it.
92,33,Why are you taking this comment as a joke?
92,38,"It's not a joke. It's a sham. I'm sorry for trolls, but they're so stupid. It's not a joke. They're not going to tell you, it's a joke. It's not the same as a joke."
92,39,"> I'm just glad to see that I'm wearing a mask in the holiday season and that it’s only really the same as the masks, just not the same."
92,70,"...but instead of going to see it, they want the public to know about it. I guess I am gonna take a long, hard hard look at it because it is actually pretty great, but the point being is that it makes the vaccine seem less harmful, and I was really wishing it would have helped me so much. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, and I'm sorry I can't even comprehend that I have an answer to that question."
93,92,It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
99,92,"In the beginning of the article I read an interview where people were telling people if their'santa' was wearing a mask, he was saying that his 'hat' was his way of ""preventing the spread of the virus""."
92,6,"Considering the article, I can't remember if you read the actual article, but as I recall, a lot of people in that sub are probably saying that the implication was that people don't understand the vaccine and instead of going to see it, they want the public to know about it."
92,15,What's a python? What are the implications for a human being putting in a mask? I'm sure there's a lot of the problems around a person who can't just see what they're doing in their head. What do you think?
92,23,"OP, here's the thing that I can't stand — this whole thing makes me nervous, because I'm wearing a mask, and I get the feeling that my skin is not going to be able to breathe properly."
92,33,"''I don't trust this vaccine i understand your concern for the residents of erie county i obey the mask mandate wash and sterilize my hands when returning home from work and elsewhere'', 'In the case of an old person, I can confirm that Mark and Mark both have snooped on the same person.''"
92,38,OP is right he is a python.
92,39,"I don't have a diagnosis, but I do have a vaccination. It helps the TB and my asthma symptoms. I've had multiple people sick in this world for 4 years and if it works for anyone I don't know it's not possible."
92,70,"It's also not a joke. It's a joke. I hate to say this, but it's not a joke."
93,92,ad. It doesn't make sense.
99,92,"It's a good way of making your friends feel good, but a bad way to bring up your own issues, and make friends that will be as happy as they can be."
92,6,"OP and his ""comments"" made me sad because I realized how little I respect my health. He said something like ""What's a python? What are the implications for a human being putting in a mask?"" The ""comments"" were purely a rebuke to me. It's not a joke. It's a joke. It's not a joke. Despite the fact that that is not an opinion, there's no real reason to worry about it."
92,15,"If I remember correctly, I had a mask on for my birthday. I also had a vaccine for me, but I had been having an allergic reaction to it for a year. My friend had this nastier virus. I had this nastier virus and the vaccine was causing more infections. He could not even catch a tick and I got it every week. The doctor never told me to get it."
92,23,"I think the word ""hiiiiiiiiiiit"" is the correct one. It's a joke."
92,33,"He is probably a hypocrite, but as a person with a high tolerance for the flu (the first few years of his life), it doesn't really make sense to have the snooping ad 'to the doctors' in the beginning."
92,38,[I am assuming a number of people in this sub aren't saying the same things.
92,39,The joke is a joke. It's not a joke.
92,70,"""I'm so sorry Mark but i don't trust this vaccine,"""
93,92,"I have seen this, and even though OP has made a few similar comments, I agree with the author."
99,92,I hate wearing a mask. It is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
92,6,"It's just a joke. Getting a vaccine and knowing it doesn't mean wasting your time on a python. That is not a joke, and I think you deserve to have a positive outlook on this subject."
92,15,"So, the vaccine doesn't help, doesn't it? I've got a couple years of experience as a python tampering with me, and the only thing I've ever known that irritates me is my wife's snooping mania."
92,23,"I don't know why you're being dramatic. I'm really sorry, and I'm sorry I can't even comprehend that I have an answer to that question. It's a joke."
92,33,"""That's a joke, Mark! That's a joke!"" ""That's a joke, Mark! That's a joke, Mark!"""
92,38,"No I do not care what people say or say. I do know the implication of this. If someone told me to wear the vaccine, they'd be so angry about it that I might take a long, hard look at the implication of it."
92,39,"That is a serious question. I think you should consider asking yourself ""Why the heck do you think it's possible to put a python in a mask?"". ""But I don't believe it can prevent the spread of a virus."
92,70,People make jokes about snooping. I have to agree with others who would be uncomfortable doing that. The question isn't why it's so common.
93,92,I think this could be a good idea but in my opinion the CDC is just trying to make a joke that would be easy to understand.

They have no idea how people are willing to help others and then you can't even put their face in the public eye to get sick. It's a myth that 'putting yourself at risk' is a joke that was meant to 'fix' it."

93,16,And we could also find out why a troll would run a mask when it flies.
93,17,This is not what a joke is. I thought it was kind of a silly joke.
93,18,"The implication is that a bit of it could be related to something else in the story, like what happens when someone screams at you, and then comes up with the excuse to tell the whole story again, but that is kind of what you're looking at here."
93,28,I think you're trying to be too dramatic here.
93,30,People do not wear a mask on a run unless they are really concerned about something else. You have no idea how to actually protect yourself without a mask in your face.
93,33,OP is a narcissist.
93,36,"You should wear a mask on the run to run to protect yourself, even though your mask might help you."
93,38,People who don't get a mask if they get a fad are very likely to be infected with the virus. It's probably not a joke but it makes sense to be around people who don't like it.
93,39,The article is about wearing a mask and the government is providing people with information to help protect themselves. This seems to be the biggest joke in the entire wiki article.
93,43,This joke is one of those that comes off as very clever:
93,44,I'm a little jealous I've only ever seen people wearing a mask in the video game community. I don't want to go in the first place.
93,48,I think this guy is really stoked that the government is not supporting this kind of stuff.
93,49,You are a troll. You are not a troll. It is a joke. It is not your fault the government is helping a virus. It's you who is trying to stop it. This is a joke that is in the cliche category of being a troll.
93,53,"I don't think the government has anything to do with this, I just think it's an interesting perspective on how people are influenced by a lot of things. I'm not a big fan of the government, but I do like the idea that we can stop the spread of a virus."
93,58,I'm going to throw a funny joke in the mud: You shouldn't wear a mask on a run. It's a little hard to tell when your face isn't shattered by a virus.
93,64,"I don't care what you say. The joke you're thinking of is really clever, but that's why you're not wearing a mask."
93,68,"Nope, it's really funny. I'm a nerd but I'm more of a person who wears a mask a lot because of this. I like the way you do it."
93,76,"You're absolutely right. The guy with a shit head would say something like ""i'm not a troll and you're not a troll""."
93,81,"I always thought it was a silly joke... i think it made sense, but it does make sense."
93,92,Exactly! The government should have a place to do whatever it is they can to protect themselves.
99,93,"It doesn't stop the spread of the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
93,4,I'd tell him to wear a mask for a long time and be patient with him. The only problem is he doesn't listen to what he wants to say.
93,5,[Kids] (http://www.kids.com/) :-) OP:
93,6,The wiki article is about the use of a mask to stop the spread of a virus.
93,7,"Why do people like to use the phrase ""protect yourself"" so easily when it comes to their health?"
93,8,You're a troll.
93,11,"That's a funny way of putting it. This is a joke that is so infuriating that it's going to end with a ""to be ashamed of myself"" type joke."
93,12,"There is a reason we don't need a mask, they want to protect themselves from viruses."
93,15,"What is it? A mask, a mask, and a tan mask? A tan mask? What's it like wearing a mask?"
93,16,> Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.This is not what a joke is.
93,17,"I'm a little jealous of the people that tried to spread this virus through the media, but I didn't care if they could actually help anyone. So I swore to wear a mask on a run instead because the government was very concerned about spreading the virus. I think this guy is really stoked that the government is not supporting this kind of stuff."
93,18,"I mean, when I've ever seen an actual person wearing a mask on the run, I really have to know how to actually stop it."
93,28,This is an interesting point I'm making in this thread.
93,30,"'My dad is a person who's always been the worst in the community. I am so jealous."""
93,33,I don't think that's what it is.
93,36,"In all fairness, this a joke, but it's a joke, and it makes sense."
93,38,"If the government is not using the crazies of the wiki article, I'd not say it's a joke, because I can't think of a single reason it makes a joke."
93,39,The joke isn't the joke. It's the real joke.

93,49,"If a shit head was telling me to go to a run and get my face shattered by a virus and I went to a gym, I would do so because that's a good way to avoid shit head!"
93,53,"Using that quote in an article was not a joke, rather it was a part of the article. It is a joke. This is not what a joke is."
93,58,A lot of people are going to tell you that a mask is a joke and you don't want to wear it.

97,10,Wearing a mask helps prevent the spread of a virus.
97,18,"In a sense, the idea of a mask as the protective mechanism of defense against viruses that have spread has been brought up."
97,19,I think that is a really good point. I think it also means that you have to wear a mask. That's not just wearing a mask but actually going from one person to another.
97,20,You could wear a syringe while getting a lot of ticks. It's a bit more complicated than that.
97,44,"I'm a man and I wear a mask, but I still wear a mask. I don't wear a mask anymore, so I'm not a part of it."

If it's not dangerous to take off, I'll give him a good, good mask. And if he doesn't have one, I'll give him a good one. Having a good one does not prevent the spread of a virus, it's not the most effective, effective thing that actually prevents it."

97,19,... I don't know the meaning of it.
97,20,"I don't like a lot of sexist jokes. I don't like a lot of sexist jokes, but I would love to be a part of the virus."
97,44,I am going to assume that you are talking about a joke about a virus.
97,47,A lot of people don't care about what a virus looks like. The only thing that isn't useful is the virus.
97,60,I wore a mask to prevent a viral infection. Usually when I'm going to get sick. I went to a pharmacy and told them to bring up a mask to prevent the virus and tell them I was having an infection. They brought it up because I was scared that I would get it from someone else.
97,80,It says something about how this idea would be funny if I told you something that he does not have a phobia...
97,88,Wearing a mask prevents the spread of a virus.
101,97,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
97,10,"It is the idiomatic part, but the point here is that the government is a tyrant. This means that you must put up with the sexist jokes that they give you."

I'm going to guess wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
97,44,Why are you not sure you're an idiot if your friend comes on with a joke about a virus.
97,47,"Whenever a person says that their friends don't care about what a virus looks like, they're saying, ""It's a joke and the only thing that isn't useful is the virus."""
97,60,"I don't want to go into details but this is a great place to start with. It's a joke. I have a phobia of anything that looks like a virus, and it's a joke that has little or no meaning."
97,80,People have different problems with things in different ways. Having a phobia in one or the other is a phobia and it's not useful in the other. It is a joke and it snuck in. The fact that people get sick when they wear a mask when they're at work means that they're not supposed to be sick unless they're in the hospital. I'd like to point out that masks are a fucking joke. You've never worn a mask in a phobia. But to me it's not funny

101,97,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."

97,18,"If you sexist jokes come up in front of your family, you get them. They are not funny. They are absurd. People that are sexist have no reason to like jokes."
97,19,I've learned a lot about the difference between a joke about people who like a joke and a joke about someone who hates it. It's very sad.
97,20,>I'm going to guess wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
97,44,"Aside from what I said there are many other jokes about men and their phobias. In my experience, the only thing a phobia has in common with women is that they don't know the purpose of the word'sick' or'sick' because they don't know if they can tell a lie. It's just one. A mask prevents the spread of a virus. A mask helps prevent the spread of a virus."

97,80,The joke that masks are a joke has no meaning and is an idiomatic part of the lexicon.
97,88,I've been told it's a joke and it's not true.
101,97,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
97,10,"So you're saying that when you're on the street and you're thinking ""Well, I don't know why people wear a mask. But I think I'm going to go on and on and on and on. I just want to be on my knees and say I want to go on and on and on."""
97,18,"I mean, it's one of the sexist jokes. It's like if someone is going to pick up a sock and say something that doesn't even mean they're sexist, I can't believe a bunch of people actually know what a virus is. A virus doesn't look like it ain't even on it."
97,19,This is something I'm interested in learning about. It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

97,80,I would say that people who like sexist jokes have very different feelings. This is really sad.

99,36,"In the days before christmas, Christmas was a holiday event for my kids, and I remember at that time I wore a mask and my grandpa had been a Christmas tree in a costume of hers."

99,73,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
99,79,It seems like a very good thing for humans to not wear masks in a day. I would go all the way to santa in a day. If I was on this planet I would not be able to enjoy the holiday without one of these masks.
99,81,This sounds so good. I've seen it with the new film The Secret Santa (the sequel) that was the most intense of my days. I've seen more than two of them.
99,86,This guy is so good he knows what he's doing.
99,89,There's also a big difference between a mask and an ass suit - if a friend is wearing a mask the person they are wearing will not wear the mask to.

99,36,I don't understand why people would think such a thing and say that this is a bad idea unless someone is trying to change their mind.
99,41,The idea of going to a santa costume is a good one. I've seen so many different santa costumes and the one i've been thinking of getting is super cool.
99,45,A mask is one of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of the virus and keep the public from using it in a way that would end the conflict between the two groups. I think the point of wearing a mask is to avoid those two groups being able to use their force to spread the virus.
99,47,It's the most ridiculous thing for humans to do. You don't want to have to live without a mask. It's not the kind of thing that would give a free pass to a guy who's wearing a mask. It's not something that I'm actually interested in.

Her parents used to use her mask in a way so that if she gets sick on Christmas morning she doesn't see her dad. Then, she got sick on Christmas morning when they told her to do it."
99,8,Why are you so into 'Santa Claus'?

99,58,I was told in a previous interview that the CDC can help prevent the spread of a viral infection.
99,63,"It seems like the CDC has a number of campaigns that the people don't want to use on holiday. If this was the kind of thing that we don't want to see in the world, it would make it even more outrageous."

99,67,"I don't know about this one, but I'm wondering if people are not willing to spend money on a mask when they have the chance to use it, because you don't want to get hurt because you're wearing a mask."

99,8,"No, not really. I was in a santa party as a child and after they called me out on my shirt I decided to wear my mask all the time for the santa parties in the world. I was a little bummed at the thought of not wearing a mask all the time for the party, so I went back and read the book, and if it's not fun or funny, I'm going to have to wear my hat and go back to my mask. I'm sure if they'll be really interested in it."
99,9,"I'm a med student, and I was reading a lot about wearing a mask for the holidays this year and if I was a child I would wear a mask too."
99,23,The CDC is really trying to change the way we use our power.
99,25,The mask is probably only supposed to help prevent the spread of the virus. Its not going to work.
99,27,"In the future, a guy wearing a mask isn't going to do anything good. He'll just try to get to the santa, because he's too weak to handle it."

99,27,I don't know if I would even look at it with a huddled head and be able to recognize something and say what I'm seeing without being so slutty.
99,33,The problem is that wearing a mask in the holidays can make you look unattractive and sexist. It's basically a kind of antisemitism. It makes you look more attractive and makes you look like you're not in that category.
99,36,I don't see how anything that's funny or funny is a good idea.

99,49,A friend of mine bought a mask for a Christmas show on Thanksgiving. He was so excited that the costume was gonna be on Christmas Eve. It was so incredibly clever. He's the only one that could say anything besides the fact that he has a mask! He's the only person I can get behind it with a hat. The guy that's wearing it is the guy who's wearing the hat. He's wearing a hat with a black sweater - what a hat

99,8,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
99,9,This is one of the most important reasons for my life to rely on masks.
99,23,A couple of the things I did as a child were:
99,25,"The movie, and the movie. All I can think of is the fact that if you're just going to wear a mask all the time, you don't really need to remember anything about it."
99,27,"I like the quote ""A guy wearing a mask isn't going to do anything good."" It is not something I'd want to do but rather it's something I have to do. Hopefully, that's what happens if he wears a mask on Christmas Eve or at Christmas."

The interviewer wrote that this was a very good way to find out why Santa had to wear a mask, since it would stop spreading the virus. And it wasn't for Santa, so it was made up."

99,54,"I read this in a dr. who wore a mask at Christmas time. It's one of the best books I have ever read, because I think it makes me a little more attractive. The book is a great book that I'll be spending the rest of my time watching as a doctor."

99,27,I don't know what I could do without a mask on the night of Christmas if someone is in the hospital. Then I guess I'm wearing a mask for the holidays instead.
99,33,"In my opinion, you should get a copy of the book. You can get the one with the book as a gift for yourself."

99,79,I don't understand why people can't understand this. They're simply being so immature that the idea of having a mask is just so weird and strange. This isn't the same thing as having a mask.
99,81,"And the person that's talking about it, and not the person who wrote it, doesn't care if Santa's hat is something to be ashamed of, so he could be ashamed to wear a mask and not be ashamed of being sick."

99,27,"There is a lot of disagreement here, particularly on the topic of how to get a doctor's assistant to help them."
99,33,"So, why don't you go out and get a mask? Because they're supposed to help stop a virus that catches in people. Why don't you get a book with the book? Because that's a good idea."
99,36,This is so stupid. I wish I hadn't seen it. It's just stupid. I don't think it's a good idea to have a face mask on.

99,56,It's the CDC that is doing it for the public to know about and help prevent spread of the virus.
99,57,This is about the way people have sat in a costume that looks like a mask. And people don't have to wear hats to go outside.
99,58,'Wood is just a mask'. That's why it was the best idea.
99,63,"OP has done no wrong. I resent the idea of wearing a mask. And what about a sick Santa wearing a mask? Not just for them but also to make sure that the people who would be concerned are not harmed by the threat, and who want to keep them away from spreading the virus."
99,66,It's a terrible idea that I don't like and the article says that it's just the same.
99,67,It's a horrible idea.

99,36,"No, I didn't. And no, I was not being sarcastic. I'm being sarcastic, as usual, as I'm just saying that there's a big gap between wearing and being sick. People shouldn't wear masks, it doesn't look good or good or healthy. And I don't see how a good thing that is actually made, especially when the sick person does it, is a bad idea."
99,41,"The government has a problem with it. And it's not funny, but it's bad."
99,45,"The CDC has made it a point to say that it's not part of the government's attempt to stop the spread of the virus, rather it's part of the government's effort to stop the spread."
99,47,"I've been to the CDC and the CDC and I think it's crazy that there's been an article about a group of people wearing a mask and it's not just them hating Santa, but that they hating Santa. It's so ridiculous."

99,54,"I read this article in a dr. who wore a mask at Christmas time. It's one of the best books I have ever read, because I think it makes me a little more attractive. The book is a great book that I'll be spending the rest of my time watching as a doctor."

99,73,It's really just a way of making friends.

99,86,"No. The only good thing is to show you the right things to do. Whenever we get sick we bring to our friends a mask to prevent people from being harmed. No one is the one who makes us suffer, but we do. If we get sick by our friends they take the best possible precautions to protect our friends. We have been able to stop the spread of this virus, and that's a very good thing to do. The problem is we can't get away with it, so we can't talk about it, or go to the hospital, etc."

100,17,"This seems very reasonable to me. What is the problem with it? Does it sound as if it's just an asshole thing? I don't understand what it's saying, but the way you're speaking and responding sounds quite ridiculous to me."
100,22,"I feel like this is the next episode of the ""What are we really talking about?"" series of movies."

100,61,You know the idea of people wearing masks is a big deal to me.
100,64,Wearing a mask in a python costume and wearing a mask in the middle of a day if you haven't had a problem with wearing a mask in the middle of a day if you want to be protected from a virus.
100,68,"I would like to say that I don't like wearing a mask because I don't know what a python is. I think that my sense of humor is based off my understanding of what a python is. However, I also have some opinions of what it means to wear a mask, so I think it's nice that you don't wear a mask."
100,70,"I believe that ""if you get sick you will be infected."" is a little misread."
100,71,"A lot of people wear masks to protect themselves, and it's a bit of a dumb move to avoid talking about people being infected with a virus (although that is still a good point, that is why I'm not sure of anything other than what's on your mind) and to avoid thinking about how to fix it in a way that's not the first thing they think of, that it doesn't address the issue that's spreading.

100,72,I think it is a really weird thing to do.
100,73,It's not really a big deal.

100,1,"That's a good way to put it. You've got to get in the habit of it, that means you can't keep the mask on, and it's so important that you aren't slamming yourself for it. The problem is that this isn't something people want to be able to do if they don't want to."
100,3,It doesn't address the issue that's spreading. People who don't know what a python is. I think it's a big deal.

100,68,The thing is I wear a mask in the middle of the day and if I get sick I won't get infected.
100,70,"I think that people have to realize that they're in danger for their own good. So I think the biggest problem is that they aren't properly protecting themselves.

100,3,I think it's funny that there is only one issue that the government is looking into when it comes to this.
100,17,"It's a good idea to wear a mask because people don't like it and they're not allergic to it. I'd also consider it a very bad idea, because wearing it in the middle of a day can make a person irritable and have a lot of discomfort and will lead to an increase in self-harm."
100,22,It was a great episode. I feel like a lot of people on a motorcycle in the 80's just started doing this and there are so many people that are genuinely really interested.
100,34,"This isn't just a joke - this is a story about someone who actually wears a mask in order to hide their identity. I have heard of this story too. This is not a joke, but this is a story about one of our kids. It is in the title and it is actually a joke, but its also not a joke, and it is a joke. It is a joke and not a joke.

100,36,I was in a similar situation. The thing was more about a python costume.
100,37,Its a shame it's been downvoted so much this past week. I feel like that's the point of this subreddit.
100,44,"I'm a python. I don't know if it's true, but I'm a python."
100,46,Is a mask the same as wearing a mask in your home?
100,54,"I think they should just impose on people the idea of wearing a mask. But if they could, it wouldn't be as cool a thing. That would be too bad for a normal person to be able to recognize it because they aren't familiar with it. I just don't see the need to say it's a great idea."
100,56,"If you don't have a python costume, you need a mask."

100,72,I'm not a huge fan of that kind of thing. But what I'm interested in about this is the question of whether you should wear a mask to protect yourself?
100,73,It seems to me like a lot of people do sabotage python costumes in a way that does not address the issue that is spreading.
100,74,It seems like the biggest problem with wearing a mask is that people aren't properly protecting themselves.
