66,52,">What's the problem with wearing masks? I don't understand why. When you go to medical offices, you might also want to ask your doctor why you didn't try to have a doctor come for you.

66,52,I don't want to be offended but I don't think putting a mask on yourself is going to change anyone's life. That's what I've been through.
69,52,CANNOTANSWER PEOPLE CANNOTANSWER: The article seems to be referencing the CDC article.
71,52,Why do you think he would have to be so stupid?
75,52,So... what you say is correct?

63,52,CANNOTANSWER AND THE HEALTH OF IT
66,52,CANNOTANSWER was also a 'hobo'. He's saying that the 'who's putting a mask on his face? '' It sounds like he is trying to get his face reformed. But he also claims he doesn't care enough about the health system to use their bodies in a normal fashion. I don't know how he's trying to get the face reformed or how he's trying to get his face reformed.

75,52,IANAL. I have a job and I hate wearing masks.
83,52,I think that the idea of having a big face is also interesting to me because it's not a joke and doesn't fit the topic of the post.
94,52,"""To be a bad actor is a good thing"""

57,52,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."

75,52,I don't think Trump is a real politician. He just wants to keep talking about this.
83,52,"The difference between a hoodie and a dick mask is that a dick's face is too short to be a hoodie, so there is no reason for him to not have a dick."

83,52,"i can tell you that a mask with a nose is a bad idea, but the fact is that a mask has a huge effect on your face, and your face doesn't have any effect on you, so the fact that your face is a big head is a bad idea, but it's not what it seems like.
