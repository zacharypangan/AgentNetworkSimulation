85,71,well saw my first person get booted out for not keeping their mask on
87,71,i have no issue with having to wear a mask i do have an issue with the fact that the situation is so bad that we have to yet people that are forced to work and interact with the public aren t being awarded hazard pay just my two cents
92,71,covid is really bad right now mask up and be careful
96,71,wrong again brainiac among the reasons for reluctance on the part of some health agencies and places to urge mask wearing is the concern about the shortage of masks for medical workers
97,71,when is the pandemic over though i know there is likely some scientifically measurable end to it but when is the social emotional end when sports resumed when i got vaccinated when mask mandates were lifted when x of americans are vaccinated
71,7,Do you know why we have to force you to wear a mask?
71,12,Vaccinations do not prevent you from recovering from a pandemic. Vaccinations protect you from people you are sick and in danger. I'm a medical student and vaccinating my son is a major reason people who are sick are vaccinated.
71,23,we keep hearing about how most kids quickly recover from covid pretty hard to recover from this wear a mask and if you can get vaccinated
71,30,Is it a mask you can wear with you?
71,31,We have so many kids that are vaccinated.
71,32,Is it the worst situation you have ever had to work in?
71,34,We are gonna get vaccinated when the pandemic is over
71,35,"Is the last time that people were vaccinated? Vaccination is such a huge cause of disease, and can cause many deaths, not just the ones that are not being treated."
71,39,"We will always have a mask in the country, but we never get enough of it. The only problem with the vaccinating is that most Americans aren't at least getting a very good shot."
71,43,You should start wearing a mask and a mask to work.
71,48,I think the lack of medical workers in the medical field is enough to give them the fear to wear a mask and not protect them at the hospital.
71,50,"I'm not a doctor, but I am also an RN. I believe that a patient who got vaccinated had to keep his or her nose shut on the first day, as he/she had to get an oral contraception to ward off the disease. It's probably because of the scarring of their skin."
71,52,The problem is with the vaccinated people being too young for their medical work.
71,56,i am a huge fan of the use of masks. i also like the idea of trying to make people ill and nauseous so i do not mind it.
71,58,"Vaccinations can cause problems in your body, including the appearance of it. But there is a reason they're necessary for those kids in hospitals, and that's because that's one of the reasons they're so resistant to vaccinations."
71,62,"The best part is that the health insurance companies and their doctors have a very very clear record of how far they have come to protect their clients, the public, and themselves, from the situation."
71,63,"oh my god, i got the first one off of a vaccinate. i have never been in an actual state where a person that i worked with didn't wear a mask because they did, and that was probably because they weren't very good at vaccination or something"
71,64,The most dangerous form of vaccine to people can't actually recover from inhaling a dose of covid is a contaminated mask.
71,67,"I don't think there's enough proof to support why kids are being forced to wear masks in the first place. There's more than enough evidence to support the concept that kids are unable to recover from covid, the lack of evidence against them, or the lack of support for the lack of support for it."
71,68,"We're talking about getting vaccinated in Canada as well, so if you can't get vaccinated, then you might not be able to get vaccinated."
71,70,We are getting vaccinated? I've been vaccinated for two weeks.
85,71,Exactly! They're not gonna stop wearing it because there is a shortage of masks for healthcare workers.
87,71,i have no issue with having to wear a mask i do have an issue with the fact that the situation is so bad that we have to yet people that are forced to work and interact with the public aren t being awarded hazard pay just my two cents
92,71,Are you sure you aren't joking? You aren't. Is that what you said?
96,71,"I don't think you've understood it yet. It's a common problem, I think. It's not the one you were talking about."
97,71,"When you get vaccinated, do you have an insurance policy?"
71,7,Is there a common problem?
71,12,"What are the most dangerous forms of vaccine to people that can't recover from inhaling a dose of covid, the lack of evidence against them, or the lack of support for the lack of support for it?"
71,23,I want to remind you of the last time that people got vaccinated when the pandemic is over
71,30,"Vaccination is such a huge cause of disease, and can cause many deaths, not just the ones that are not being treated. We will always have a mask in the country, but we never get enough of it."
71,31,I can’t be sure about the vaccation that is going on in the U.S. but I do have an insurance policy that pays for vaccinations.
71,32,"> we are gonna get vaccinated when the pandemic is over Is the last time that people were vaccinated? Vaccination is such a huge cause of disease, and can cause many deaths, not just the ones that are not being treated. We will always have a mask in the country, but we never get enough of it."
71,34,I have no problem with having to wear a mask but not to be vaccinated. My boss said it's something that was never addressed.
71,35,What is the problem with the Pandemic? Are there any ways that the world can help people?
71,39,I'm an RN and have not heard anything like this 
71,43,What's the worst part about this situation? They're not being given the hazard pay they deserve.
71,48,The problem is with the vaccinated people being too young for their medical work.
71,50,What's the joke? What's the joke?
71,52,Are you sure you aren't joking? Is that what you said?
71,56,"Vaccinations can cause problems in your body, including the appearance of it.

71,58,Are you sure you aren't joking? You're just saying that you aren't going to get vaccinated when the pandemic is over?
71,62,Do you think they're willing to pay for the vaccine because of the scarring of the skin?
71,63,"The best part is that the health insurance companies and their doctors have a very very clear record of how far they have come to protect their clients, the public, and themselves, from the situation."
71,64,"Vaccination is such a huge cause of disease, and can cause many deaths, not just the ones that are not being treated."
71,67,"I don't know about the last time I got vaccinated, but I think the only reason we're getting vaccinated is because of the contaminated mask."
71,68,I am a RN and a medical worker. I've never had a problem with getting vaccinated by my employer. Is there a shortage of masks for healthcare workers in the country?
71,70,Are you sure you aren't joking? You're not joking.
85,71,"Well, how's your mask on? You should wear a mask, because I'm not a healthcare worker and I can't make my mask work for an hour! Well there are many medical workers that don't wear a mask while working, but do wear one when they're stressed - that's what the company is doing. And a doctor who was trained to wear one during surgery and was given no reason to wear one during an accident may also be booted, which may lead to the restraining order"
87,71,"Vaccination entails that the immune system is unable to keep up with the increasing demand for vaccines, so vaccination may be the only solution to this problem. Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
92,71,"Okay, that’s a weird sentence. So, you’re saying that you aren’t sure you aren’t joking? You’re saying that you don’t believe in science? Is that what you said?"
96,71,"> Isn't wearing a mask a sign of a lack of masks for medical workers? I don't understand why. When you go to medical offices, you might also want to ask your doctor why you didn't try to have a doctor come for you. We have to keep masks on the workers. Isn't wearing a mask a sign of a shortage of masks for medical workers? I'm so sorry. I don't understand what you mean. Is it okay to have the system in the first place."
97,71,When is the pandemic over though i know there is likely some scientifically measurable end to it
71,7,The question is why people don't wear masks?
71,12,I have no problem with having to wear a mask but not to be vaccinated. My boss said it's something that was never addressed.
71,23,"In an interview with a medical student, they say: I have no problem with having to wear a mask but not to be vaccinated. My boss said it's something that was never addressed. What's the worst part about this situation? They're not being given the hazard pay they deserve. The problem is with the vaccinated people being too young for their medical work."
71,30,I'm not sure if the best way to address the problem is by providing the information about what's happening with the pandemic. But when it is over I don't think I'd really get sick if I wasn't vaccinated.
71,31,What's the joke? Are you sure you aren't joking?
71,32,I'm glad you are not just laughing because you're an RN and have never had a problem with getting vaccinated by your employer. It's a joke you're trying to say because it isn't true.
71,34,I am a medical worker. I get vaccinated every time I work and I don't get sick.
71,35,"That's a joke. I'm not joking. Unless you have more information, don't t say anything."
71,39,"Oh, really. Who is it that you think it is OK to have the system in the first place?"
71,43,I am not sure how your story fits into this.
71,48,It is all a joke.
71,50,You have no idea how it was joked?
71,52,"There is not really a problem with this but rather an issue with lack of masks for medical workers. There are only two options for me. The first, I wear a mask, and the second, I don't wear it because the doctor won't give it to me when it hurts."
71,56,I am a huge fan of the use of masks. I also like the idea of trying to make people ill and nauseous so I do not mind it.
71,58,I don't know why a person would be baffled by something that's actually a joke.
71,62,"I don't want to go to the doctor, but I'll have the insurance help me."
71,63,I have no problem with having to wear a mask but not to be vaccinated. My boss said it's something that was never addressed. What is the problem with the Pandemic? Are there any ways that the world can help people?
71,64,"A few other people in this thread say that the virus is very difficult to recover from and this is why they need to wear a mask. This is also why many people cannot recover from covid, even if they were given a dose that was contaminated, and their body would be infected."
71,67,I have no problem with having to wear a mask but not to be vaccinated. My boss said it's something that was never addressed. What is the problem with the Pandemic? Are there any ways that the world can help people?
71,68,Is a mask a sign of a shortage of masks for healthcare workers?
71,70,I don't understand what you're saying. You're just saying that you don't know how to make a joke about a restraining order because you don't know what they mean. I'm sorry. I don't understand what you mean.
85,71,"IANAL, OP: I am not an attorney for medical personnel and they can use that excuse to boot up and be responsible for disciplinary action against them Exactly!"
87,71,"Whenever it does, it makes me angry."
92,71,"No, that’s a weird sentence. So, you’re saying that you aren’t sure you aren’t joking? You’re saying that you don’t believe in science?"
96,71,"I have a feeling that if you want a medical emergency to get you a mask, it’s going to be expensive and that you can’t afford to take a mask."
97,71,Vaccines should be banned on the dd oxfam vaccination list. It's a great idea if the CDC can find out what the ddoxmm vaccine is. When does the pandemic start? when is the pandemic over though i know there is likely some scientifically measurable end to it

71,30,"I'm a lawyer and a lawyer, and this is a joke, I do not think I'm a lawyer, I just know what she's trying to tell you."
71,31,What a terrible joke. It was a very strange coincidence. It's funny.
71,32,I think a restraining order for a doctor is a prank.
71,34,IANAL: I understand that a restraining order would be a prank and I don't think it's a prank. A restraining order for a doctor is a prank.

71,48,"""... The problem is the lack of time to do vaccines. What is a restraining order for a doctor is a prank."""
71,50,I would like to say the following. I don't like the word'sex offender' anymore because the word'sex offender' is a completely different meaning. I think a restraining order is a prank.
71,52,"I’ve done several things to prevent this from happening. I know that this is a problem with patients, I think it is important to be on the right side of the line, but I think it is unfair for hospitals to allow their patients to get vaccinated in a situation where they are sick. It’s not a sexist joke because it’s wrong, but I think it’s right. The CDC has a vested interest in that issue."

71,63,"That was actually a good point. The whole thing I think is a prank. Cannan, a doctor of some sort, gets very uncomfortable with the thing when he does it and can't resent the situation."
71,64,"i know the situation, i was talking about the lack of time to do vaccination, so i think it's a prank."
71,67,"The article cited is a little bit long, but I don't see that it fits within the context of the post."
71,68,So how does a restraining order work?
71,70,I understand that a restraining order would be a prank and I don't think it's a sexist one. But I think it's a prank. A restraining order for a doctor is a prank.
