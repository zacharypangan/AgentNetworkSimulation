50,29,"Is your mask for health? If so, tell me what you want for your health and see if it goes away."
50,38,What a waste of time and energy. I've never been a medical professional and I feel like a realist in that way.
53,50,A fda's bluff at the fbi has found a way to bind a contaminated person to their mask as part of the public health vetting process. You may want to consult with an obstructed health professional about that situation.
55,50,"Hi, I just saw you are running miles across Florida right now curious if you would share what is the route im in Orlando and would love to come run with you even if just for a mile i d wear a mask and keep distance"

71,50,"I'm not a doctor, but I am also an RN. I believe that a patient who got vaccinated had to keep his or her nose shut on the first day, as he/she had to get an oral contraception to ward off the disease. It's probably because of the scarring of their skin."
76,50,I am not a doctor and I cannot see your face so if you have disinfected your hands recently you are in a bad situation.
81,50,What is the point of wearing a mask over a mask?
85,50,I was so chuffed that they booted me for not keeping my mask on. I could see a way I'd been able to find the person I was with when he left the office and it was like that and it wouldn't have happened if I didn't have my mask on
86,50,"i have never worked in a covid mask but i have always gotten offended by it, especially for wearing it because it irritates me to no end if you try to get away from me :"

50,22,You sounded kind of depressed to me.
50,29,"I am an obstructed health professional, and I eat meat and exercise to prevent any spread of viruses. I can eat fat, which is a real irritant. But a black mask, or anything else like it, is the most convenient way to get people to be vaccinated. If it was my work, I'd eat a black cloak of meat (I love them but they are more expensive). If I was on the job, I'd use a plastic bag or something like that. I don't care if it hasn't"
50,38,> What does wearing masks do to prevent the spread of infection?
53,50,I see your concern with people getting sick as a result of wearing a mask. I'm concerned that people getting sick as a result of wearing a mask. I think it's a good idea to go to the doctor and check for symptoms. I think a lot of people have no idea what the issue is that is affecting the public health.

96,50,It's not about a shortage of masks for medical workers. It's about having a shortage of masks for medical workers. There is no such thing as shortage of masks for medical workers. Those are not a sign of a shortage of masks.
101,50,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
50,2,> What does wearing masks do to prevent the spread of infection?
50,4,Vaccinating individuals with HIV is not a problem? It's something that is not discussed by many healthcare professionals.

71,50,You have no idea how it was joked?
76,50,"He didn't say something. I was just saying he said something because he has no idea how to stop him. What he did is a very simple joke that's so funny to me, and I have no idea what that would be."
81,50,I'm sorry this is a weird joke. I am not a guy and my doctor doesn't care about the masks and bends. It's only a little weird that I wore a mask to prevent me from going crazy. It has nothing to do with the fact that I'm not a great person.
85,50,"IANAL, OP: I am not an attorney for medical personnel and they can use that excuse to boot up and be responsible for disciplinary action against them Exactly!"
86,50,IANAL but I was on that group. You have the right to be offended.
88,50,"I think we all like wearing masks, I don't think it's a problem if you do that. But it doesn't sound funny. It's a bad mask - people are just getting more and more uncomfortable with it and can get angry about it, I don't think it's a good mask to wear - but they like it. I think it's a better mask for the job, and its a great way to get out of stress."

96,50,A - I'm a pedophile.... I can't be sure what I mean when I say I can't afford a mask. But I'm sure there are other people out there who would prefer that. What does wearing masks do to prevent the spread of infection?

50,4,I had a nice guy with a face mask that got my head cold. I was not very comfortable with it so I would have to wear a mask.

50,22,"OP, the second amendment will probably be abused by the government, the public, the hospital, or the doctors. Regardless of if this is the reelection troll, this witty joke has been uttered multiple times over the past decade."

55,50,"I don't think that you're a scumbag, but I'm not sure what that means. I've been walking the route for 4 years, and I don't remember the date."
64,50,CANNOTANSWER wants to go about vaccinating everyone. What can he afford?
67,50,"I like the ad, but I'm going to give it to my son. He is 21."
69,50,I would definitely go see a movie about an ex-Military with a man in it. Arnold Ribbeneggers. The person in question is probably a child with a mask.
71,50,I think you're in a position to be a joke.
76,50,"""Hi, I am going to be with you tonight, just because you need to go home is something I really need to do to help you with your health."
81,50,Oh yay! This is why I wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over. I really want to know this. I want to know this. I want to know this. I want to know this.
85,50,I think it's a shame that you haven't worked in a workplace where this happens. It's not like they're trying to force you into employment.
86,50,> I'm just curious what is the difference between wearing masks and being a medic and not working with a doctor.
88,50,"It sounds like some people in the video aren't talking about the anti-masked kind of person who says, ""The people who are completely anti-masked don't like to wear masks to school, but they do want to get them banned. It's to prevent others from dying and prevent others from dying. It's to prevent people from dying and potentially prevent others from dying."
93,50,And the first one in the title is also the name of a sexist joke about having a sex with a woman he is referring to
96,50,I hate to get a pedophile. But I do love that I'm a pedophile.

50,22,[NAME](http://neo-american.org/) voted in favor of banning the mask mandate in favor of getting fully vaccinated individuals ('You look like a nice guy') and 'I'm not a guy and my doctor doesn't care about the masks and bends. I'm just saying he said something because he has no idea how to stop him. '
50,29,CANNOTANSWER is not a troll.
50,38,Is a doctor not allowed to make me wear a mask when my child is older? Because I don't think so.
53,50,CANNOTANSWER: It's a bit weird when a group of people is actually wearing a mask over a mask that isn't actually a mask. I'm not even mad at him.
55,50,"I think that one's pretty funny. if you like a joke about the person in the video, why don't you try to talk to a teacher and tell them that people are essentially wearing a mask to fight an anti-masked person? This is a question that should be asked."
64,50,"This is not an uncommon situation, but there is a pretty big question here: How much can someone legally legally afford to pay for their health care without vaccinating them?"
67,50,"""There is not enough evidence to support why kids are being forced to wear masks in the first place."""
69,50,"It is interesting that this is a question from another subreddit. One of the people who I have talked to is the guy in the article, who is a Georgian. She is a woman and I know that she has no interest in it, but it is a question that she is asking myself. This isn't the article about a law about people who are wearing a mask. I am not sure what's going on but I'm going to ask you, since this article has led to a lot of controversy."
71,50,The medical field is still struggling in the fight against the pandemic. This is the biggest problem. The healthcare system hasn't stopped.
76,50,"""Well, I didn't think it was a joke. I just said that I think it is."
81,50,"I wear a mask and bend over all the time, and I don't want to be a doctor - the first part is a joke. I don't understand how you're going to say it, but I don't think it's weird to wear a mask because you don't like it."
85,50,"I'm not a lawyer, but I'm not a lawyer. I think the restraining order may have been issued for ""not keeping a mask"". ""This is a real concern of mine for a couple of reasons."
86,50,> I don't get how many doctors I see and even if they did they would be able to tell who is sick. They would have to take care of all of it.
88,50,">I do, but I don’t like it. I don’t like the idea of it, but I do not want to wear it. I don’t think it’s a good idea to wear a mask. I'm very happy with the hive mind if I’m wearing it. I don’t think it’s a better mask for the job, and its a great way to get out of stress."

96,50,I think you may have missed the part where the person that is on the radio who has a mask is asking what the real deal is about the lack of masks for medical workers.
101,50,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."

55,50,"I've been walking the route for 4 years, and I don't remember the date."
64,50,Why should a doctor come in and clean up his illness?
67,50,Is the mask mandate a law in your state?
69,50,"IANAL - Huge Covid fail to have Santa not wearing a mask in thanksgivingdayparade would have been so powerful and such an endorsement of healthcareheroes wearamask.

He says ""what do you think of the movie and the movie?"" which is the reason why he has no interest in being a superhero. I think I can't see this coming out of it, but what about the kind of mask I'm"
71,50,"Vaccination is one way of getting some of the worst possible symptoms. When is the pandemic over though i know there is likely some scientifically measurable end to it. The problem isn't with the pandemics, but rather with the shortages in medicine. It's a fucked up situation."
76,50,CANNOTANSWER OP CANNOTANSWER OP CANNOTANSWER OP CANNOTANSWER OP
81,50,">I'm just curious what is the difference between wearing a mask and being a medic and not working with a doctor. I'm a doctor and have been vaccinated for the past few years. Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
85,50,CANNOTANSWER IANAL

50,9,>He's just curious what is the difference between wearing a mask and being a medic and not working with a doctor.
50,22,I think the joke is too obvious.
50,29,"I’m not a dr. It just feels so strange to me that there are people who are trying to save money on this. I think that the problem isn’t with the pandemics, but rather with the shortages in medicine."
50,38,"This is not a'really weird joke'. This isn't an actual joke, it's more of a joke that's not relevant or relevant. This is a joke that is often left out and left out of conversation because of a false assumption."
53,50,"CANNOTANSWER: The last time I wore a mask, I was on a bed laying with my pants down and my arm around the head and it became a numb look from the outside. Then I realized that I wasn't wearing a mask because I was worried about not feeling well."
55,50,"I'm a doctor and I've heard that it's a kind of sex mask. It's actually pretty attractive and you don't need any type of sex mask. It's basically just a mask that lets you see what you're getting into. It's a good way to prevent any bodily activity from happening. Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it. ""Why do people keep asking this yes i've had multiple exposures in tight places no mask long time periods like an hour"
64,50,CANNOTANSWER wants to go about vaccinate everyone. What can he afford?
67,50,CANNOTANSWER:
69,50,"And also the fact that it is so expensive to purchase a mask, and also has a high cost of living (you don't have to pay for that kind of cost) to buy one."
71,50,How did you get on the list of the CDC vaccines?
76,50,I've always heard people say that people are the only ones to really want to wear a mask. So that's the problem.

85,50,It is a real concern of mine for a couple of reasons.
86,50,>Why aren't the people wearing masks an anti-masked person?
88,50,"They want to revoke their OCD. They don't want to stop them from dying or dying, but they want the right one banned. The 'anti-masked' person doesn't think a mask is a good idea. They're also not really against it."
93,50,"Yeah, because when he's in public and he's not even a guy with a fat lip, he's also wearing a mask to get out in public and he's only wearing one thing and only one is a fat lip."
96,50,"I mean, my neurologist is not that good at using masks but he is more concerned with how medical workers have been exposed. I know he wears a mask for his doctor. I think it's a sign of a shortage."
101,50,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
50,2,"It is weird that someone is trying to take the CDC and the government out of their health care budget, and even if they are doing a good job they don't have any incentive to spend that much money on it if they're not getting the best treatment."
50,4,CANNOTANSWER is not an ad hominem doctor. His neurologist is not that good at using masks but he is more concerned with how medical workers have been exposed. He says he thinks it's a sign of a shortage.
50,9,The CDC and the government are trying to protect people from infections and not just the people who are getting sick. I think it's a shame that you haven't worked in a workplace where this happens.
50,22,I'm not sure why you think this is a joke?
50,29,There is a difference between wearing a mask and being a medic and not working with a doctor.
50,38,"""I think it's a shame that you haven't worked in a workplace where this happens. It's not like they're trying to force you into employment."
53,50,It is a shame that the OCPS didn't come back.
55,50,I don't know why the woman doesn't want to be an apologist.
64,50,"I like to wear masks at work because I can't afford to get sick. Cannonswer is trying to convince his boss that he can not afford to get sick. There would probably be a dick or a child in the workplace. Why did the CDC not decide on a ban on Vaccines yet, so there's that?"
67,50,"""As an Indiana citizen, I know that I have a face mask, a mask, a mask, and a mask. The CDC says that is a bad idea. If it's a law in your state it's probably a bad idea for people to vaccinate someone who doesn't have a mask."""
