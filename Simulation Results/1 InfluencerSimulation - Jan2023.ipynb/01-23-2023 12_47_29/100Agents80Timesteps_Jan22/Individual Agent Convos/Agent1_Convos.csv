85,1,"OP? You mentioned how he did not take care of the mask on, right?"
89,1,What does it mean that the number of people who do not wear masks isn't actually that low? I would say that is the most reprehensible reason and it's not something to be afraid of.
96,1,What's the problem with wearing masks? I don't understand why.

96,1,"I'm just curious what is the difference between wearing masks and being a medic and not working with a doctor. I don't think I've ever really noticed this problem in the UK.

96,1,"I don't know why, but the main thing that I've heard about masks is that they are not a sign of shortage, and that they are not necessarily an indicator of a shortage. So i'm asking where I heard that people want them and where they get them."

They are all tampons and all and if I don't get vaccinated I get my son. I don't like my dad, but I can't afford to go to the hospital. I'm going to have to have a baby and a lot of doctors are sick and I'm worried because they can't find the kids."
69,1,This is how the CDC says things.
72,1,"Why do you need to wear a mask at work? I know because I can't wear a mask outside and in my car because I want to work with people outside of me that are going to be more than happy to sleep in my car, because I am so uncomfortable. It seems like a joke that's all kinds of silly and inappropriate. I'm not going to pretend he's a covid, but I think it's a really silly idea to make that one sound disgusting."

48,1,the masks on the workers isn't a sign of a shortage of them.
69,1,This is an important point that needs to be worked out by all the public. I think you're being a bit naive.

43,1,I have a friend who has been infected with coronavirus - I was just worried he had a virus that could spread in his family. He told me this story while I was talking to a friend of mine from school and said that when he was out of school I would use a mask.

85,1,CANNOTANSWER'S PRESENTATION:
89,1,CANNOTANSWER is also an AIDS patient and is asking why the NHS doesn't work for medical workers because of shortage.
96,1,CANNOTANSWER is a pedophile.
97,1,CANNOTANSWER is saying that she's surprised that the CDC doesn't know about the pandemic.

23,1,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
24,1,CANNOTANSWER is an anti-masked guy who hates wearing his mask.
43,1,There's an example of the joke being funny.
48,1,"CANNOTANSWER and REENEW I'm going to take the comments and call it a prank. CANNOTANSWER said that you shouldn’t tell your employer how the vaccine is for 'the people doing the work'. If you’re gonna bluff, you need to get a CDR in order for you to avoid being injured."
69,1,What do you think the government is trying to get in the way of addressing this issue?
72,1,"I'm going to take a picture of the image, because it doesn't sound like he has a mask on."
78,1,I was really a bit confused. I was thinking if pranks were sexist they would be inappropriate or sexist.
85,1,CANNOTANSWER'S PRESENTATION
89,1,I am a health practitioner and have never worn a mask at work. I am a medical practitioner and I wear a mask when I am stressed.
96,1,"The UK is not a healthcare system that's growing, because the UK doesn't have enough doctors and nurses to treat HIV/AIDS patients. The UK has a shortage of doctors and nurses. The NHS needs to focus on the current problems rather than the current ones."
97,1,Is there any way you could explain that the CDC doesn't know about the pandemic.
12,1,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."

24,1,CANNOTANSWER:
43,1,CANNOTANSWER PEOPLE
48,1,Why is he an anti-masked nut?
69,1,"The word ""canna"" is a lot of people's business. If you aren't paying for a hazard for work and don't wear a mask to be covered by your employer's insurance, I think it is a good idea."
72,1,I don't think you're being sarcastic. What are you trying to say?
78,1,"Yes, the whole idea of a prank sounded funny to me."
85,1,CANNOTANSWER'S PRESENTATION
89,1,"Are there other stories describing the pandemic and AIDS, or is there some kind of general consensus that the US is getting a lot of anti-AIDS and anti-paediatrics?"
96,1,"CANNOTANSWER's an expert on the topic of HIV/AIDS and have seen multiple times. The UK is so bad because it has no shortage of medical workers,"
97,1,"""Cannotanswerer is giving her perspective on the pandemic, not the CDC."""
12,1,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
23,1,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
24,1,"CANNOTANSWER explains that when someone thinks a mask is cool, they will wear it and they may feel cool."
43,1,The joke has more to do with the fact that a doctor isn't good enough and not being able to make people sick. The fact that they are making a movie about a doctor's job is an example of a prankster getting sick and being able to tell a joke without a mask.
48,1,Cannotanyer says that he's not a lawyer.
69,1,What does a doctor have to say about these things?
72,1,It was a prank. It is a joke.
78,1,"Yes, I think that the whole idea of a prank isn't funny, or funny, or sexist, and that's why pranks are obnoxious."
85,1,"The only answer to this is: ""What if I went to the hospital and got vaccinated? I'm really a bit of a prankster. A prankster is not a lawyer."""
89,1,"""What's this pandemic saying about the medical system?"""
96,1,"CANNOTANSWER is an expert on the topic of HIV/AIDS, and have seen multiple times.

89,1,Is there a shortage of medical workers?
96,1,">The UK is so bad because it has no shortage of medical workers, The UK has a shortage of doctors and nurses. The NHS needs to focus more on the current problems rather than the current ones."

23,1,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
24,1,Cannonanyer and REENEW I'm going to take the comments and call it a prank.
43,1,"IANAL is a way of saying that any number of things you say are valid. I am a good teacher, but I enjoy talking about it with students who I think need to wear a mask. I think most people just don't know why the word is used in jokes. It doesn't sound like a joke at all."
48,1,It's because they are not safe and do not have a reason for it.
69,1,CANNOTANSWER CANNOTANSWER CANNOTANSWER
72,1,"The wiki page is in the “Redditor“ category and it has the names of the commenters. In the article, it says that it was a joke that is a joke. This makes you feel offended and a bit awkward."
78,1,It's not funny because people think that the word'masked' is inappropriate. It's funny because there is a difference between being a prankster and being a prankster.
85,1,"CANNOTANSWER'S PRESENTATION: I am a doctor and I’ve been given a medical certificate that says I don’t wear a mask at work. Apparently, this isn’t a medical malpractice suit."
89,1,Is there a shortage of people for medical workers? A patient who wants to get medical assistance wants the NHS to work for him.
96,1,">The UK is so bad because it has no shortage of medical workers, The UK has a shortage of doctors and nurses. The NHS needs to focus more on the current problems rather than the current ones."

12,1,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
23,1,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
24,1,"Is a mask a joke or is a joke an anti-masked person, or is the prank a joke?"
43,1,"I'm not sure if you are referencing that one. The only thing I can say is to remind you that the CDC can't just ban the Vaccines. It's a prank, not a joke."
48,1,CANNOTANSWER and REENEW
69,1,CANNOTANSWER CANNOTANSWER CANNOTANSWER CANNOTANSWER I think that this prank is a lot more about not being able to be a doctor.
72,1,"The article suggests that you are an educated adult. It is a very, very specific post."
78,1,"I'm not a doctor, but I still have a job."
85,1,The 'cannotanSWER' is a joke.
89,1,"CannotanSWER tells me that a lot of people who don't wear masks are very ignorant of the problem, and in the US they have a shortage of workers for doctors, because the AIDS pandemic is global."
96,1,CANNOTANSWER:
97,1,The point of the joke is to explain what CDC doesn't know about the pandemic.
12,1,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
23,1,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
24,1,What is the point of a restraining order?
43,1,"""I am not a doctor, I am a nurse. I am not a doctor."""
48,1,So the article was based on a piece of data that shows that it was a joke in terms of the vaccine. That's why i'm not sure that this is a joke.
69,1,I think that this is the prank that i hate about people in the US.
72,1,"> ""Hey, I'm in the minority here. I don't see any problem with wearing a mask in order to ward off the virus. It's not an apologist thing, but it's just a mask. He's not a coven. I am not a doctor. A little of all, he's a doctor."
78,1,"My favorite is ""Will I just sit down with my friends and I make a joke?"""
85,1,"In the UK, most people have been given a medical certificate because of the shortage of masks if not for the lack of a mask."

96,1,"""Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."""
97,1,CANNOTANSWER does not like the idea of someone who gets vaccinated for a Ddoxmm vaccine. Vaccination is like a disease. People are very resistant to it and if they do not get vaccinated they are unlikely to die. Why do people think that vaccines shouldn't be banned?
12,1,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
23,1,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."

69,1,CannotavanWorr says:

78,1,"My favourite is ""Will I just sit down with my friends and make a joke?"""
85,1,>I think the restraining order isn’t a legal one. I think they may want to look into this issue.
89,1,They are trying to avoid a pandemic.
96,1,">I'm a patient and it is a good idea to wear my own mask whenever I go to an emergency room, or even in the middle of the night, or on a hospital bed or an apartment, or a place of worship."""
97,1,Vaccines aren't really like a disease. People are very resistant to it and if they do not get vaccinated they are unlikely to die. Why do people think that vaccines shouldn't be banned?

23,1,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
24,1,CANNOTANSWER is an anti-masked guy
43,1,"A prankster is the same as a prankster. That's why there are tons of different kinds of pranks, but if it's just a prank, the joke will get over."
48,1,"It's the same for a therapist and a doctor who is not in an office, and who is working in a hospital. The problem is that a doctor is being overly cautious about the safety of his workers."
69,1,CANNOTANSWER CANNOTANSWER
72,1,">Hey, I'm really not a doctor, but this is very disturbing to me."

69,1,"The CDC is threatening to ban vaccines, but the CDC can't do anything about it."
72,1,">Hey, I'm not a doctor. I am not a doctor."
78,1,"I like the premise that everyone here is trying to understand why people think a joke is inappropriate. Specifically, ""Why are they going to make a joke about my friend?"" (as is sometimes the case in those places), and the premise that a joke is inappropriate is an assumption of sexistness that can't be justified by just saying that it isn't a joke, but rather that a joke is a joke about the other person, and you're referring to ""people "" with a joke about my ""clingy"" and ""I'm"
