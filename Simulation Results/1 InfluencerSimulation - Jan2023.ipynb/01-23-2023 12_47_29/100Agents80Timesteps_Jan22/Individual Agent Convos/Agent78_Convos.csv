78,26,I think the mask given by the OP makes them appear to have some sort of prequel or something in your head that shows up to them in person. That could be a good explanation of why you haven't been to Georgia.

78,1,That is a lot of good writting for me to be able to get on that line... I guess people like to joke.
78,4,"I feel like you are being a dick, and I know that you are not joking. You're just being a dick."
78,5,"Isn't Georgia an extremely large state of Georgia? I'm not sure what the rest of Georgia looks like, but I think Georgia is very close."
78,9,I think it s pretty obvious that you're in no way implying that the people in Georgia you're meeting are religious or something like that.
78,19,And they drew them from Georgia as a prequel in the Bible.
78,22,"Hey OP, if you haven't been to Georgia yet, what's going on here?"
78,24,There's a difference.
78,26,"OP: ""i think the mask gives them covid there s so few oh man you should come to Georgia it s like people here think wearing a mask gives them covid there s so few oh man you should come to Georgia it s like people here think wearing a mask gives them covid there s so few oh man you should come to Georgia it s like people here think wearing a mask gives them covid there s so few oh man you should come to Georgia it s like people here think wearing a mask gives them co"
78,28,"I am not really going to go to Georgia. I am going to go to Georgia because I feel the OP is going to be a dick, but I am going to go to Georgia because I am going to go to Georgia to visit a friend. I am not going to go to Georgia because I feel the OP is going to be a dick."
78,43,"Ok, you don't know a thing about religion? You should come to Georgia it s like people here think wearing a mask gives them covid there s so few"
78,44,"I don't want to be the one to make that statement, but I still have this statement to make and I feel like it's not in my head."
78,62,"Yeah. I feel like I've been getting the premise wrong. You've only spoken the words out loud, I can't figure out why you didn't know the answers - you were so close to being the correct one, or how you had a misunderstanding about religion and what to make of it."
78,69,I always tell people to go out and see a real movie with people in it. I'm from Georgia.
78,76,"I came here to make a joke about a dick. I wanted to make a joke about Georgia s a lot more than a couple of words, and I've never heard a joke about Georgia s alot. So when I said it to you, I immediately thought it was a joke about a dick : ""We should go visit a dick. You should come to Georgia. The mask we wear gives us covid there s so few and it gives them a little covid there s so few"
78,1,Yeah. People get a little clingy and aren't even looking.
78,4,"Is Georgia a large state? I'm not sure what the rest of Georgia looks like, but I think Georgia is very close. I think it s pretty obvious that the people in Georgia you're meeting are religious or something like that. And they drew them from Georgia as a prequel in the Bible."
78,5,"I think that when people do what they love in a good way, it's important to take the time to think if the world really needs that. As for the mask, it's just a way of introducing a different perspective to the world. I'm not saying Georgia should be a huge state, I'm just saying that if we're going to make a lot of jokes about how religion is used, it's a good place."
78,9,"[Two times in one sentence, I can't say anything except say, ""I think wearing a mask gives them covid there s so few oh man you should come to Georgia it s like people here think wearing a mask gives them covid there s so few oh man you should come to Georgia it s like people here think wearing a mask gives them covid there s so few oh man you should come to Georgia it s like people here think wearing a mask gives them covid there s so few"
78,19,And they drew them from Georgia as a prequel in the Bible.
78,22,"I don't have the facts to back that up, but I think it's pretty obvious that you're in no way implying that the people in Georgia you're meeting are religious or something like that."
78,24,"OP : ""Oh man you should come to Georgia it s like people here think wearing a mask gives them covid there s so few oh man you should come to Georgia it s like people here think wearing a mask gives them covid there s so few oh man you should come to Georgia it s like people here think wearing a mask gives them covid there s so few oh man you should come to Georgia it s like people here think wearing a mask gives them covid there s so few oh man"
78,26,I don't see why you would be on that line. That is a lot of good writting for me to be able to get on that line...
78,28,"OP, this is what I told you yesterday."
78,43,"OK. First, you know what I am saying. That's pretty obvious. It's just one thing that you aren't implying. What is the point of saying something like that to someone else?"
78,44,"You don't mean to get all tense when you say ""I didn't know the answers. I don't want to be the one to make that statement, but I still have this statement to make and I feel like it's not in my head."""
78,62,I think it's pretty obvious that you are being a dick.
78,69,You are an idiot. That is why you have to fuck yourself about it.
78,76,"You don't know the answer to this question? I've never heard the answer to a joke about a dick, and I know that I was able to get it. So, I'll go to Georgia... but I'm not really going to go to Georgia. I am going to go to Georgia because I feel the OP is going to be a dick. I'm going to go to Georgia because I am going to go to Georgia... I'm not really going to go to Georgia..."
78,1,I'm so sorry OP! I am very sorry that I didn't get to find out what you're saying!
78,4,"I think it's just that when people do what they love in a good way, it's important to take the time to think if the world really needs that."
78,5,"When I am going to Georgia, I feel like there isn't enough time to make a joke about how I'm in Georgia. When I'm going to Georgia, I feel like my shit is so much better than yours."
78,9,"OP, I'm not really going to go to Georgia, I'm going to go to Georgia, but I'm going to go to Georgia because I feel the OP is going to be a dick, but I am going to go to Georgia because I feel the OP is going to be a dick."
78,19,I'm not going to go to Georgia to visit a friend.
78,22,"This is the first time I've ever heard the term ""Masked Man"" and it's really not something I ever use. You don't sound too familiar with it, and it sounds like you are a bit of an idiot for being into it. I think it's really a pathetic word in a phrase that if you're just referring to the literal meaning of the word, you're just getting into something else. It's really very obnoxious and stupid, and it's not that obvious that this isn't happening to you, it"
78,24,"I am so sorry you're having trouble with the joke. It's really annoying when someone uses the word ""Masked""."
78,26,"[Always tell people to go out and see a real movie with people in it. I'm from Georgia. I came here to make a joke about a dick. I wanted to make a joke about Georgia s a lot more than a couple of words, and I'm not sure what the rest of Georgia looks like, but I think Georgia is very close. I think it's pretty obvious that the people in Georgia you're meeting are religious or something like that."
78,28,"No, I really don't. What I am saying isn't the correct thing, I was just joking."
78,43,I am not really going to go to Georgia.
78,44,"I've been trying to figure out why people aren't getting the premise wrong. It's pretty obvious that you're being a dick, but it's not in your head."
78,62,"A dick isn't a dick, it's a person who thinks it should be a god-like place."
78,69,"> If I said something like that to you and i just realized I wasn't implying anything, I would never have been able to be able to get on that line."
78,76,> I'm not really going to go to Georgia. I am going to go to Georgia because I am going to visit a friend. I am not going to go to Georgia because I feel the OP is going to be a dick.
78,1,"If I could've just put this on the table to laugh at the people, I would've been right, and it's not that hard. But, the point of making a joke about a dick is to be aware of what people say, and not just to make the joke. I think that if you say ""I didn't know the answers, but I still have this statement to make and I feel like it's not in my head."
78,4,"I thought the question was what you were asking for? I was not sure what I was asking for, I just thought you were asking for something. You're telling a joke about something that might be worth mentioning, a dick. And then it comes to your mind that it is a real word that is really important."
78,5,"i'm gonna go to Georgia to see a movie with a mask, i think the apocalypse of the mask is a very good joke to make in a state that is pretty huge and i'm gonna be in Georgia at some point."
78,9,"OP, this is what I told you yesterday. OK. First, you know what I am saying. That's pretty obvious. It's just one thing that you aren't implying. What is the point of saying something like that to someone else? You don't want to be the one to make that statement, but I still have this statement to make and I feel like it's not in my head. I think it's pretty obvious that you are being a dick. You are an idiot."
78,19,"The word ""Masked Man"" is probably not the same as the word ""Move-Masked"", since ""It's so much like people here think wearing a mask gives them covid there s so few "", 'oh man you should come to Georgia ', 'oh man you should come to Georgia ', 'Ouch!'"""
78,22,"""Hey OP, this is what I told you yesterday. OK. First, you know what I am saying. That's pretty obvious. It's just one thing that you aren't implying. What is the point of saying something like that to someone else? You don't want to be the one to make that statement, but I still have this statement to make and I feel like it's not in my head."""
78,24,That is so rude to tell you. You are just getting into the idiocy of an unlucky person who is joking.
78,26,"I think ""Masked Man"" is like 'Mom and the mask' (not in a non-fiction book) which is actually a bit similar to that used for the phrase ""Mouse"". It's not a joke, but more like the joke about the mask."
78,28,"This is my first time hearing the word ""Masked Man""."
78,43,"I have a friend that works in a hotel, who's in a 'Masked Man' style hotel, and she told me that she's from Georgia. We both like her and enjoy it. She doesn't want to go anywhere and I get so upset that she cannot accept her shit in public and thinks it's okay, so she leaves to visit the hotel."
78,44,I can understand where you are coming from.
78,62,"The word is a word you've heard a hundred times and it's quite often used by other people, particularly in a joke or a comedy. You'd need to be able to read a few words in your head before saying anything."
78,69,"That's not the correct sentence, and I don't really understand how that's relevant, if you think that's what you were referring to and your etymology, but I believe it's in reference to the phrase a little bit more than that. You seem to be having issues with some words and the word itself isn't just a dick."
78,76,I have been told times that people aren't really into the word mask. I didn't get the context. And I'm not sure I understand your joke. Is there anything else I can do for you?
78,1,"""But, the point of making a joke about a dick is to be aware of what people say, and not just to make the joke."
78,4,"No, I really don't. What I am saying isn't the correct thing, I was just joking. I am not really going to go to Georgia. I've been trying to figure out why people aren't getting the premise wrong. A dick isn't a dick, it's a person who thinks it should be a god-like place."
78,5,"No, I really don't. What I am saying isn't the correct thing, I was just joking. I am not really going to go to Georgia. I've been trying to figure out why people aren't getting the premise wrong. A dick isn't a dick, it's a person who thinks it should be a god-like place."
78,9,You are not being a dick. I am not going to say that you're being a dick. I don't see any reason for your friend to be upset. It seems a little ridiculous that you can't even make an effort to make a joke about this state.
78,19,"Hey! Are you going to Georgia? Because you're not going to Georgia because you think the apocalypse of the mask is a very good joke to make, and you think a dick would not exist in Georgia? I don't think you're really going to see a movie in Georgia. What about you?"
78,22,"There's a whole other thread about r/analyzefags, and a bunch of other people just like to call it ""Masked Man"" (and I can understand where you're coming from, but I don't think the first sentence of the whole thing would make any sense) since this is a joke about the premise of a sexist joke."
78,24,"I am sorry that you are having trouble with the joke. It is really annoying when someone uses the word ""Masked"".', 'That is so rude to tell you. You are just getting into the idiocy of an unlucky person who is joking.''"
78,26,I have a few stories that seem kind of similar:
78,28,"""I'm gonna go to Georgia because I feel the OP is going to be a dick."""
78,43,">No, I really don't. What I am saying isn't the correct thing, I was just joking."
78,44,What's wrong with the word mask? Why is it so commonly used in jokes?
78,62,"""I really don't. What I am saying isn't the correct thing, I was just joking. I am not really going to go to Georgia."
78,69,"""The word is a word you've heard a hundred times and it's quite often used by other people, particularly in a comedy. You'd need to be able to read a few words in your head before saying anything."""
78,76,So I'm joking:
78,1,"If you fucking scream at me in public, and I make a joke about you - I say ""Ok i should see you in Georgia I am a fucking clingy woman - I don't understand your joke."" I also say ""I don't see the point of making a joke about a dick... 'Ok, if you are the type of person that likes to laugh at people, you don't do the jokes because they are ""okay""? It's a little bit"
78,4,I was wondering why people don't like a joke about it. I'm not sure why.
78,5,"The joke is that the word is a dick, but it isn't the exact premise of it being used in a joke. It's also that some people don't even know if the term is sexist, as it is."
78,9,"The words ""Masked Man"" and ""I feel the OP is going to be a dick."" I don't even like it. Is there anything else I can do for you?"
78,19,"That's not the simplest joke I've ever heard, but if you're in a different city that is not like that, I can bet you'll come across it a couple of times."
78,22,"It sounds to me like you're having issues with some words and the word itself isn't just a dick. It's probably just because you're making it up and you think it's cool, but that's just your opinion, right?"
78,24,How about a fucking woman with an inflated eyebrow saying that she isn't doing the proper thing to a mask?
78,26,I don't think 'Masked Man' is a joke.
78,28,What is your favorite prankster?
78,43,"[Ask the OP about the joke, and it's all up to you to determine who you are and what the meaning of this word is.](http://www.r/askyournons/relationships/). That's a very good point."
78,44,"How can a comment like ""Masked Man"" be considered sexist and/or sexist? Does it come off as such in most of the jokes?"
78,62,"“Oh, I feel like I've been getting the premise wrong. You've only spoken the words out loud, I can't figure out why you didn't know the answers - you were so close to being the correct one, or how you had a misunderstanding about religion and what to make of it. You seem to be having issues with some words and the word itself isn't just a dick."
78,69,"I am sorry. I am just joking because the phrase mask seems to come off as a little weird, and I feel you're joking about it because it's in reference to the phrase ""dick"" in the comics."
78,76,I am a huge redditor and i don't make jokes. Just because someone isn't into the word mask doesn't mean they can't do them.
78,1,““I’m gonna go to Georgia because I feel the OP is going to be a dick.”
78,4,oh man! that's cool. I'm gonna go to Georgia because I feel the OP is going to be a dick.
78,5,">Another joke. ""Masked Man"" isn't a joke. ""I feel the OP is going to be a dick."""
78,9,I do the pranks. The OP is obviously not into the jokes. I have never heard of any of them.
78,19,"""I'm gonna go to Georgia because I feel the OP is going to be a dick."" (http://www.r/askyournons/relationships/)."
78,22,You said that as a prankster?
78,24,"'I want to go to Georgia, but I can't get to Georgia, so I'm not going to go to Georgia.'"
78,26,"I think ""Masked Man"" is ""a joke that someone is making up and isn't the exact premise of the word being used in a joke. It's also that some people don't even know if the term is sexist, as it is. The words ""Masked Man"" and ""I feel the OP is going to be a dick."" I also say ""I'm just joking because the phrase mask seems to come off as a little weird, and I feel you're making up and"
78,28,"I'd say I like the sexism a lot more than the sexism. There are actually lots of sexism jokes on youtube that are really easy to tell, too. But I love sexism, and that's exactly what sexism is for. If the sexism has changed in the past few years it's more like the sexism being on the air. I don't like the jokes. I like the jokes. I would do them, but I'd be more"
78,43,I think most people just don't know why the word is used in jokes.
78,44,"How can a comment like ""Masked Man"" be considered sexist and/or sexist? Does it come off as such in most of the jokes?"
78,62,"""My favorite prankster is a woman with an inflated eyebrow saying that she isn't doing the proper thing to a mask."" I also say ""I don't see the point of making a joke about a dick... 'Ok, if you are the type of person that likes to laugh at people, you don't do the jokes because they are ""okay""? It's a little weird, and I feel you're joking about it because it's in reference to the phrase ""dick"" in the comic"
78,69,"I think there's a lot going on here. There is a huge difference between saying ""I'm gonna go to Georgia because I feel the OP is going to be a dick."" and """"Ok, if you are the type of person that likes to laugh at people, you don't do the jokes because they are ""okay."" It's probably just because you've been getting the premise wrong. I feel like I've been getting the premise wrong. ""Oh, I've only spoken the words out loud, I can'"
78,76,"""I'm gonna go to Georgia because I feel the OP is going to be a dick."""
78,1,"In this context, what are your favorite jokes?"
78,4,You don't make jokes. You make jokes about the joke you are making.
78,5,"The ""Masked Man"" part is pretty cool and I am gonna go to Georgia for a prank."
78,9,I'm a very active redditor and my favorite prankster is a woman with an inflated eyebrow saying that she isn't doing the proper thing to a mask.
78,19,"I've heard a bunch of the other ""Masked Man"" jokes about the lack of a 'Dick-Action' joke, which was pretty good."
78,22,I think what's your favorite prankster?
78,24,"That’s a pretty good point, and I don’t think it is appropriate for a prankster to use the word “masked” as a joke. (http://www.r/askyournons/relationships/)."
78,26,"There is a huge difference between ""I feel the OP is going to be a dick"" and ""I feel the OP is going to be a dick."""
78,28,"This is my first time hearing the word ""Masked Man.""', 'This is my first time hearing the word ""Masked Man"".', 'What is your favorite prankster?', 'What is your favorite prankster?', 'What is your favorite prankster?', 'What is your favorite prankster?', 'What is your favorite prankster?', 'What is your favorite prankster?', 'What is your favorite prankster?', 'You are"
78,43,> What is your favorite prankster?
78,44,"A bit too big for me - in a little bit I got the impression ""I'm not into it"" was the wrong word. I was more to the point when I felt like I wasn't into sexism and had a really naive idea about the meaning of sexism, that I didn't think I was into it. So it's weird to hear ""I feel the OP is going to be a dick,"" then tell the person ""I don't see the point of making a joke."
78,62,">A prankster is a woman with an inflated eyebrow saying that she isn't doing the proper thing to a mask. I also say ""I don't see the point of making a joke about a dick, I feel the OP is going to be a dick."" (http://www.r/askyournons/relationships/)."
78,69,"It's funny because there is a difference between being a jokester and being a prankster. I always ask, ""What is your favorite prankster? "" ""What is your favorite prankster?"" ""What is your favorite prankster?"" ""(http://www.r/askyournons/relationships/)."
78,76,>What is your favorite prankster?
78,1,"A lot of people seem to think the term ""masked"" is not appropriate. It's kinda a sexist term, if only because it's appropriate."
78,4,"I would say that ""Masked Man"" is the one to go out with my friends and if I'm going to be on the fence about what to say or to do, then a good thing isn't to say it because it sounds like it's more about the fucking man than about me being a guy."
78,5,I think the apocalypse of the mask is the best prank ever made.
78,9,"I don't think I understand the context, but I know the jokes. I just feel like I'm being an idiot."
78,19,How's it going to go?
78,22,">[The whole thing is really very obnoxious and stupid, and it's not that obvious that this isn't happening to you, it's] (http://www.r/analyzefags)"
78,24,I'm in a similar position but I have a friend who is a prankster. She gets a lot of sexist jokes and she makes fun of pranksters.
78,26,I was really gonna say it was a very interesting question... I don't think I was that funny at all.
78,28,(http://www.r/askyournons/relationships/). I'm a very active redditor and my favorite prankster is a woman with an inflated eyebrow saying that she isn't doing the proper thing to a mask.
78,43,It's funny because there is a difference between being a prankster and being a prankster.
