85,84,well saw my first person get booted out for not keeping their mask on
94,84,huge covid fail to have santa not wearing a mask in thanksgivingdayparade would have been so powerful and such an endorsement of healthcareheroes wearamask
96,84,wrong again brainiac among the reasons for reluctance on the part of some health agencies and places to urge mask wearing is the concern about the shortage of masks for medical workers
84,29,i think it's ok to be fully vaccinated but it's too anxious to not be vaccinated?
84,46,"I m not sure what you mean by ""not fully vaccinated, but i still wear my mask bc wayyy too anxious to not ""."
84,74,I'm not totally vaccinated but I still wear my mask bc wayyy too anxious to not
85,84,Is that not why you have a mask on?
94,84,"i know a lot of people that i have heard say that about him, but i think the big one is this guy. i wonder why he went to the gym and stayed there and watched them fight."
96,84,"You said that you were concerned about a shortage of masks for medical workers, not about the shortage of masks for medical workers. So I thought I'd say you're right."
