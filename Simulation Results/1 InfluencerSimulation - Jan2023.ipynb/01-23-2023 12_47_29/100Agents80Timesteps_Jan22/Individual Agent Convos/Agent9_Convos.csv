24,9,I think the question isn't whether or not I can actually put my mask on but does it prevent people from getting sick from it?
42,9,Vaccination does not work for everyone. Vaccination isn't done to protect you from all infections.
50,9,"i m not sure if I can explain your remark, but in addition to the ones that sound really vague to me... i would want to ask why they would put masks on the faces of people who weren t vaccinated for a good reason (i could be wrong if i didnt know that...)"

42,9,Are you sure you're not a zombie? Because that's not your problem. You can't have a mask without being a zombie.
50,9,How about the fact that the CDC and the government are trying to protect people from infections and not just the people who are getting sick?
54,9,Do you think you'll ever get sick by wearing a mask? Because that's not a funny answer.
