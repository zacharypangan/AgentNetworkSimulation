33,32,those who want to protect themselves from getting sick have every right to masks keep you more safe than no mask in tight settings everyone has the right to do whatever they want now at their discretion
40,32,says the woman that wears the mask to protect herself lmao well dear the gun works the mask doesn t
41,32,can we developed a mask or helmet that will protect us from corona and that everyone would have to wear to go outside for a month or that would allow us to open up the economy again
57,32,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
67,32,breaking indianapolis city county council has voted to ratify new public health orders which include removing the mask mandate for fully vaccinated individuals the health orders now go to the mayor to be signed
71,32,we keep hearing about how most kids quickly recover from covid pretty hard to recover from this wear a mask and if you can get vaccinated

91,32,walking out of the grocery store in florida and i m taking my mask off as i just walk out some old lady walking in looks at me and goes thought this was a free country just laughed at her go get your groceries and be quiet lady
32,6,The fact that people who want to protect themselves from getting sick have every right to masks keep you more safe than no mask in tight settings is a sad truth.
32,10,Hey there! I got a full-body mask for my birthday. I am not allergic to all kinds of things.
32,12,Thank you for your response. Thank you for your insight.
32,15,I can't seem to get enough sleep while wearing a mask.
32,18,"i don't understand why people are getting sick without a mask, its just not that good. i think i've got the same issue."
32,19,The current repression of medical use on the public health front is terrible. What they've said is what it says:
32,21,... Is this how you get your groceries from an orphanage or is your neighbor's property being vaccinated?
32,24,"This is all about us. Let's go ahead and buy a mask, and then go to the grocery store. Tell me what you think."
32,27,> I am wearing a mask amp bend over walking out of the grocery store in florida and i m taking my mask off as i just walk out some old lady walking in looks at me and goes thought this was a free country just laughed at her go get your groceries and be quiet lady
32,30,"Well, they were trying to make their job very difficult and the job is a waste of time, unless they're doing something completely counterproductive and illegal."
33,32,So you've been exposed to this virus since a while now?
40,32,The woman is the one who threw out the entire sarcasm and hate speech in the u.s.
41,32,"It is ridiculous. I want to know if we could make an attempt at such a thing? If we have to, I am really sorry."
57,32,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
67,32,IANAL but i think the Mayor is a terrible vaccarian
71,32,Is it the worst situation you have ever had to work in?
81,32,"This is why fuck it! I'm scared I have to do it. IF YOU CANT SEE IT, THIS GUY MUST KNOW."
91,32,CANNOTANSWER:
32,6,This seems really weird. How are they being repressed?
32,10,This sounds very very unhygienic. I know some people that are just being incredibly sarcastic.
32,12,I am not familiar with the laws about it but I heard this woman is being a huge part of this conversation.
32,15,"I can't figure out how to get enough sleep without a mask, so why are you asking why?"
32,18,I don't understand why people are getting sick without a mask.
32,19,Is there a specific government organization that could help you with preventing public health problems?
32,21,CANNOTANSWER: They're telling us we're gonna get caught. It's really sad how the politicians of the u.s. have not had that opportunity to do anything they want to. Surely people in the state will continue to try to get sick of this disease.
32,24,"I'm in the middle of a job, you can't do anything about it. You can only do it for money, you can only do it for yourself."
32,27,Oh my God! I’m sick. I’m afraid you’re not the only one whose sick?
32,30,Are you still in Florida? I just got out of Florida.
33,32,"So, I don't care about your health, but I do care about yours."
40,32,Your friend is a moron. You don't want to be the one to make the decision. It's unfair to her to be the one to make the decision to end the life of her friend and family by getting them to do what they do best. I'd rather get the job than go get the medicine to help them get their doctor's appointment.
41,32,You can't make an attempt.
57,32,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
67,32,I am a citizen of the United States.
71,32,"> we are gonna get vaccinated when the pandemic is over Is the last time that people were vaccinated? Vaccination is such a huge cause of disease, and can cause many deaths, not just the ones that are not being treated. We will always have a mask in the country, but we never get enough of it."
81,32,If it doesn't fit then you shouldn't wear a mask or a mask over a mask and a bend over.
91,32,how many u-paws do you need to get?
32,6,">This is why fuck it! I'm scared I have to do it. IF YOU CANT SEE IT, THIS GUY MUST KNOW. CANNOTANSWER: This sounds really weird. How are they being repressed?"

32,12,"CANNOTANSWER's friend is a moron. This is why fuck it! I'm scared I have to do it. IF YOU CANT SEE IT, THIS GUY MUST KNOW."
32,15,The mother of one of my best friends is a moron. I'm afraid that she doesn't understand why people are getting sick without a mask.
32,18,I don't think you're a person who is not a citizen of the United States.
32,19,CANNOTANSWER says that the current repression of medical use on the public health front is terrible. He said it's pretty odd how people are getting sick without a mask.
32,21,Why are people getting sick without masks?
32,24,That's not a good way to answer the question.
32,27,"Is the last time people were vaccinated, when the pandemic is over?"
32,30,CANNOTANSWER'S friend is a moron who needs to get vaccinated.
33,32,"People who haven't had multiple exposures in tight environments don't wear a mask, they only have to wear one once. The fact that people don't wear a mask is a red flag."
40,32,I do not see how the issue isn't an argument.
41,32,"I don't like being in contact with my colleagues and colleagues because they are going through this situation in an emergency. It's ridiculous and it's not a good idea to put on a mask if there's one that allows them to leave in the middle of the day. But yeah, we need a lot of help."
57,32,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
67,32,"Is there a reason people don't wear masks in their life? Because there are very few ways to prevent it. If you wear a mask, you can get into a fight and you will never get caught."
71,32,I'm glad you are not just laughing because you're an RN and have never had a problem with getting vaccinated by your employer. It's a joke you're trying to say because it isn't true.
81,32,I want to get a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please

32,6,"The first sentence is a little more like ""I'm glad you are not just laughing because you're an RN and have never had a problem with getting vaccinated by your employer. It's a joke you're trying to say because it isn't true."
32,10,The family member who gets sick by wearing the mask is a moron. He should go to a local hospital to get vaccinated.
32,12,"It's a joke to say that people don't wear a mask, a red flag."
32,15,"CANNOTANSWER says that the current repression of medical use on the public health front is terrible. He said it's pretty odd how people are getting sick without a mask. Why are people getting sick without a mask? Because there are very few ways to prevent it. If you wear a mask, you can get into a fight and you will never get caught."
32,18,CANNOTANSWER tells how sick people are and why they need to get vaccinated.
32,19,That is an unfortunate scenario. Who is a moron?
32,21,Are you okay with the idea that if you didn't have a mask you wouldn't have got sick?
32,24,A friend of mine has a mental illness and she is getting sick.
32,27,I'm a moron who needs to get vaccinated and it's ridiculous and it's useless. Is there a reason people don't wear a mask? Because there are very few ways to prevent it.
32,30,CANNOTANSWER said that the current repression of medical use on the public health front is terrible.
33,32,"i don't really see why he's wearing masks at work, I think it's a better solution."
40,32,The premise is that the woman is going to take a choice between going out with a fat lip in and being the one making the decision to end the life of her friend and family.
41,32,"No, the word is ""too dangerous"" (the phrase is wrong), but this is not a funny joke. I am trying to get a grip on this, but I think you're fucked."
57,32,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
67,32,"I'm a citizen of Indiana and I know that I have a face mask, a mask, a mask, and a mask. The CDC says that is a bad idea."

32,19,"I'm not a moron, I'm a moron."
32,21,A lot of people have said they don't want to go to a hospital to get vaccinated.
32,24,"I've seen some haters who actually have the ""I'm a moron who needs to get vaccinated"" joke, like that."
32,27,"I've tried a few different masks. One one is an actual one that is more useful than an expensive one, because the price is reasonable for it. The other one is made so that your doctor can make sure that you get vaccinated."
32,30,"The fact that she's got the job is a bad thing and I doubt she should get vaccinated by her employer. So yes, I'm sure she'll be able to get it."
33,32,"A mask isn't something to be ashamed of. If he wanted to make the right choice, he would wear it."
40,32,How is it a good idea to wear a mask for coronavirus because it's a good idea? You need to go to the doctor.
41,32,"""The wikipedia article states that vaccines are still on the market because the mandate isn't lifted yet. I have been wearing a mask since my mid-30s. It's really horrible - no idea why.

57,32,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
67,32,"CANNOTANSWER, CANNOTANSWER, CANNOTANSWER"
71,32,"The worst problem you have to deal with when you're sick is not getting vaccinated. It is so bad that when it's over, vaccinating people is not a way to cure illness."
81,32,A restraining order?
91,32,There is no need to be so incredibly angry about CANNOTANSWER's assertion that the US government is infringing on rights to the US. The government is trying to force it on you.
32,6,Why? Can't we eat or go to the park?
32,10,What does it say? The government is trying to force it on people. The government is trying to force it on them.
32,12,What's the biggest problem you have to deal with when you're sick? Is it like the government is infringing on rights to the US? The government is trying to force it on you.

32,21,"I wore a turban when I was 17 and it blew up while I was walking to work. I am still at work but i don't have enough money to pay for a mask. I am also not very good with clothes and have not been on vacation for a long time. I drew a picture of myself and asked my husband to pick me up. I was too scared to get my turban back, and the man said he needed to go to the doctor. He didn't want to do that, and if it was to be used up"
32,24,"CANNOTANSWER TRUST YOU CANNOTANSWER TRUST YOU I am not a moron, I am a woman. I am a woman. I do not understand why people are going to get vaccinated. A lot of people have said they don't want to go to a hospital to get vaccinated."
32,27,That is the worst issue I've ever seen.
32,30,The US government is trying to force vaccinating people through the use of a mask.
33,32,It's a good question.
40,32,I like the idea of wearing a mask because I like to go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows i like wearing a mask because i can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows i like wearing a mask because i can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows i like wearing a mask because i can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows i like wearing a mask because i can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows i like wearing

71,32,Vaccination is one way of getting some of the worst possible symptoms. When is the pandemic over though i know there is likely some scientifically measurable end to it.
81,32,"- The first part is so annoying and insensitive that people say ""Okay, if you like wearing a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over, Please I'm just curious"
91,32,Your question was really not a good one.
32,6,CANNOTANSWER: I'm glad you are not just laughing because you're an RN and have never had a problem with getting vaccinated by your employer. It's a joke you're trying to say because it isn't true.
32,10,The word is a part of your conversation with the government that has been used a lot to get me through this thread. It's not like the whole thing is an argument to be made here.
32,12,A restraining order? There is no need to be so incredibly angry about CANNOTANSWER's assertion that the US government is infringing on rights to the US.
32,15,"That sounds like a really good question. I do agree with most of what you're saying, but I also think that if you wear a mask and you bend over, it's like a fucking slap in the face with a slap in the face. I would like to wear a mask but I can't figure out how to wear a mask."
32,18,CANNOTANSWER IS A CANNOTANSWER! CANNOTANSWER HAS A CONFIDENTIAL PASSION WITH CANNOTANSWER!
32,19,"Well, I would say that it sounds like a good idea, but that your mom should be the one to 'let her pick the people'. If you don't like wearing a mask for that, you can't be the person who's gonna let you wear it."
32,21,What is this restraining order?
32,24,"The first part is so annoying and insensitive that people say ""Okay, if you like wearing a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend overplease"

33,32,CANNOTANSWER (cannot comment on your title)
40,32,Why would you wear a mask when you've never had a virus before?

67,32,"I am an Indiana citizen and I know that I have a face mask, a mask, a mask, and a mask. The CDC says that is a bad idea."
71,32,Vaccination is a great idea if the CDC can find out what the ddoxmm vaccine is.

91,32,I think the most important thing to take into consideration is that the US government is infringing on its right to our freedom.
32,6,"Because the federal government doesn't care what a RN is doing, and they do."
32,10,>why would you wear a mask when you've never had a problem with getting vaccinated by your employer?
32,12,Why would people have to be vaccinated?

32,19,I think the most important thing to take into consideration is that the US government is infringing on its right to our freedom.
32,21,"The CDC isn't infringing on public health right in any way. The only way the CDC is doing this is for patients to know they are being protected and also for people to feel like it's a sign of the government's incompetence. The government cannot do that, so they should keep preventing that from happening."
32,24,"""We are not going to change any of this - we can't change anything - but we have to change the rules and procedures to make sure that we will be able to be allowed to wear whatever we please. We can continue to support our health."""

32,30,CANNOTANSWER says he knows exactly who's the next one he wants to fuck.

40,32,I think the premise is that the woman is going to take a choice between going out with a fat lip in and being the one making the decision to end the life of her friend and family.
41,32,"It is a very interesting fact, especially if you consider it just a joke."
57,32,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
67,32,CANNOTANSWER has been told that the federal government doesn't have the money to ban ACA vaccines in the future.
71,32,> We have too many meds in the UK to get people to wear masks. Vaccines should be banned on the CDC's pandemic list.
81,32,"In a different thread, a comment was posted a while back that was similar to the one where they said he was a doctor who had been vaccinated. What does the answer say?"

32,10,I'm trying to figure out why he doesn't want to be the next one with a mask. I don't think you can do it.
32,12,CANNOTANSWER's friend is being a huge part of this conversation.
32,15,"[NAME], and his friends in general."
32,18,CANNOTANSWER is a Canadian and not American.
32,19,So he's going to go to the CDC and ask them about a policy they need to make to prevent these types of diseases in the future? Because that's where the real debate is.
32,21,"I've read many of your comments, and have seen your comments a little bit. My first is that you say the health care system is a pity for everyone because the government can't have people's safety in the hands of government officials. My second is that the government isn't doing anything to prevent the disease."
32,24,CANNOTANSWER: I'm glad you are not just laughing because you're an RN and have never had a problem with getting vaccinated by your employer.
32,27,I like it when people talk about the white house's incompetence and they all go on about how the US government is incompetent and is trying to 'cut off' it.

40,32,"IANAL and CANNOTANSWER are both doctor. A mask, not a doctor, isn't an acceptable defense against a prankster's point of view."
41,32,I read this book with a professor about what she thought the best thing to do was to be a doctor. But the writer was pretty funny about it. I had no idea this was a joke at all.
57,32,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."

32,18,"You're right that Canna is a prankster, but you're making a point."
32,19,So the problem is not that you don't understand that the CDC is trying to force it on you. It's that you don't know that the US government is 'infringing on rights to the US' and that your opinion is the one that should be treated with dignity.
32,21,"The title is so naive to be a prankster, it makes me think it makes him an idiot and not a prankster."

32,18,CANNOTANSWER tells us that he is a prankster but he 'cannot be a doctor' and 'can't be a doctor' is also a joke about the CDC 'cause the government isn't providing any health care.

32,19,"I'm gonna go ahead and let you know that I'm still a dr. Then, after all, I'm not a lawyer."
32,21,My point is the title is misleading because it says the CDC is incompetent.
