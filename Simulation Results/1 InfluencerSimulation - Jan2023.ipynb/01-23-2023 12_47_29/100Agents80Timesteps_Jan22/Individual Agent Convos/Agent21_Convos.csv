61,21,finally the topper on this covid cake when the mask mandate isn t lifted and accessible vaccines are still a few weeks out for most of us
62,21,prioritize your comfort over the life of another human being masks are a little uncomfortable sure but do i want to risk spreading the virus to people who cannot afford to get the virus not at all wear a mask
88,21,i know it s for the best of all but wearing a mask for hours at work is so tiring and annoying props to those healthcare workers for doing it for such long periods of time

21,5,You're a big joker here! And I love you! So are you talking about my kid? What's up?
27,21,Welcome to the internet. I am a doctor and I want to prevent the spread of the virus. It's really a strange issue.
32,21,... Is this how you get your groceries from an orphanage or is your neighbor's property being vaccinated?

61,21,"ah i see, its a good one"
62,21,Especially if your in the army. I'm sure there's more to it than you think!
88,21,"This one, Mr. Obama?"
94,21,"Hahah, you say it's like the elves were just wearing the mask."
21,5,"In a nutshell, why doesn't your kid get a vaccine and go to the vet to get it?"
27,21,"Are you wearing your mask, and have you asked the mayor of the county to sign a bill to remove the requirement?"
32,21,CANNOTANSWER: They're telling us we're gonna get caught. It's really sad how the politicians of the u.s. have not had that opportunity to do anything they want to. Surely people in the state will continue to try to get sick of this disease.
39,21,I don't know if I need to go through with this but it's not the most effective.
61,21,"CANNOTANSWER: i think it is ridiculous he used the mask to prevent santa from using it at all I don't like your style, but this is a really good question."
62,21,"> I feel like the only thing that is a little uncomfortable with the virus is a mask. :(... you know what you say and you are not that far from the truth? I can't wait to go to a doctor, I have to get the virus vaccinated to get sick. But it's so fucking cold outside right now... I'm so sorry. I have a very good memory and I'm not too scared. What can I do to prevent it from happening to me"
88,21,There are some folks who are 'anti-masked' and some who say it's the worst thing that a job requires?
94,21,I've gotta say that I like Huge Covid a lot. I feel like they're the kind of people who wouldn't go to work unless they have to.
21,5,CANNOTANSWER: I'm a doctor and I want to prevent the spread of the virus. It's really a strange issue. It's really sad how the politicians of the u.s. have not had that opportunity to do anything they want to.
27,21,I've been taking antivax and a mask for several years. When I got my second flu I did not wear a mask.
32,21,Why are people getting sick without masks?
39,21,"It's actually more than a few days, because the first time the vaccine came out in the public hospital was the first time a person had been vaccinated and when a doctor asked if he would want to get his or her daughter's life ruined, the doctor said it was too long to wait, because he was going out with her. This is one of those days when they can't really change the situation."
61,21,>How does this come up in this sub?
62,21,I can't even imagine how many times I've been screaming that I have the virus in my face and how many times I've heard it happen (especially as a child)... I can't imagine anyone on my family and I would be so embarrassed..
88,21,I would be a little nervous wearing a mask.
94,21,IANAL - Huge Covid fail to have Santa not wearing a mask in thanksgivingdayparade would have been so powerful and such an endorsement of healthcareheroes wearamask.
21,5,CANNOTANSWER: What kind of things can I do to prevent it from happening to me?
27,21,The fact that the mayor of the county did not sign a bill to remove the requirement of a mask from the public health order seems odd to me.
32,21,Are you okay with the idea that if you didn't have a mask you wouldn't have got sick?
39,21,"CANNOTANSWER: ""Why do you have a mask on? I want one to protect me from my family's virus, but I have nothing against it."""
61,21,"I'm a man, I do not wear masks. I'm sure you would be in a good place to find a good one."
62,21,I'm sure this post is very serious. The only thing I am talking about is the fact that I have a very good memory.
88,21,What are the two answers? I think there's an absolute lack of any reason to consider the question.
94,21,"Aye, Huge Covid fails to have Santa not wearing a mask in thanksgivingdayparade would have been so powerful and such an endorsement of healthcareheroes wearamask."
21,5,Who doesn't want Santa to have a mask because Santa would have a bad time?
27,21,I don't really think a mask in public is really going to prevent the spread of the virus. It's something that a lot of people do. The question is why do people put themselves into the public health order that's supposed to protect the sick. They think that it can't be done with the proper tools.
32,21,A lot of people have said they don't want to go to a hospital to get vaccinated.

I am also not very good with clothes and have not been on vacation for a long time. I drew a picture of myself and asked my husband to pick me up.

21,5,>Who doesn't want Santa to have a mask because Santa would have a bad time?
27,21,I want to say that I don't really think a mask in public is really going to stop the spread of the virus. They think that it can't be done with the proper tools.
32,21,"I've read many of your comments, and have seen your comments a little bit. My first is that you say the health care system is a pity for everyone because the government can't have people's safety in the hands of government officials. My second is that the government isn't doing anything to prevent the disease."
39,21,">Why do you have a mask on? I want one to protect me from my family's virus, but I have nothing against it.'''"
61,21,There's an IANAL who has an argument with a doctor who is an apologist and it's a joke about a patient's face. It's a joke about the person's face that is numb and the mask is an acceptable response. The problem is that it's not actually joke. It's just a joke that is a joke.

94,21,"I think you are being way off-putting, but I think this is very much what I wanted to say to say. I don't see how having a mask and being not an IANAL is going to make anyone look like a superhero.
