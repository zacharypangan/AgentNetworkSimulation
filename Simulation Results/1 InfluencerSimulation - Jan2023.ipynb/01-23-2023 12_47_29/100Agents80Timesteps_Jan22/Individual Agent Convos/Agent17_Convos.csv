57,17,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
64,17,The issue of wearing a mask at work is really concerning to me and I don't know why it would be that easy to get sick in public. But there's a couple of different ways to do it.
90,17,"I think Kannonsky is a good teacher, but I can't even say he is a great teacher."
18,17,Is this the title of the article? Because the title is a bit misleading because I can't even get to the exact title of it.

90,17,> Cannotanyer is not a great teacher. I’ve also heard that the mask is a kind of sex mask. It’s actually pretty attractive
18,17,">It's a common misconception that the anti-masked mandate is a good idea. I feel that the way to describe the world is quite unhelpful and can be used in some situations to give you the impression of being a fucking nutjob."""

41,17,>I think it's a good idea to start with what the hulk means.
42,17,You should talk about it with your supervisor and explain what he is attempting to do. You can't be a doctor with your head in your mouth.
43,17,I would just call the CDC a joke and not an actual problem. A joke that could be used as a joke is a joke about a guy being a prankster.
57,17,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
64,17,"Cannotanyer is anti-masked because he thinks a mask is cool, uncomfortable and unnecessary. Kannonsky's mask is uncomfortable because it is not as comfortable as a mask. Kannonsky is anti-masked. Kannonsky is anti-masked and has been a great teacher, but he was not an expert on the subject. Cannonsky's mask is uncomfortable and unnecessary."
90,17,>Cannotanyer is also an anti-masking teacher.
18,17,"In the book it says the only way to prevent the virus is to stop it. There is no reason why that's not a problem, just the idea of the hat. It's a really sexist joke, and it's really offensive."

42,17,"Cannotanyer's boss is trying to convince his boss that he is an anti-masked fan and a medical professional. He is trying to use the dreaded ""masked shit"" joke for his point."
43,17,"They're a joke. They're a joke. They're jokes. There's no way to tell a joke about a doctor without a doctor. Unless the doctor wants to get a restraining order against him and he has the chance to restraining order, then this joke is just a joke."

27,17,It sounds like the people at this show are a few hours behind.
36,17,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
37,17,"It's a joke because it is a joke. I'm sorry to say that, but I do not believe the current law does anything about it unless you have a valid reason to believe it is a joke."
41,17,I don't think there's a big issue here.
42,17,I think the trolls are insinuating that a mask is anti-vaccination because they think it's a joke?
43,17,"I don't think it's a joke because it's a joke, but because they're using it as a joke about a joke about a joke about a joke about a joke about a joke about a joke about a joke about a joke about a joke about a joke about a joke about a joke about a joke."
57,17,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
64,17,I like this story because it makes the point that a restraining order does not actually make an attorney.
