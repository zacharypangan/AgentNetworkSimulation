48,46,> I think the lack of medical workers in the medical field is enough to give them the fear to wear a mask and not protect them at the hospital.
49,46,I'm not even a doctor. I'm a professional doctor.
54,46,"IANAL, but I believe that the only reason that I had to wear a mask when I had coronavirus is because I had to do it several times, and there are a lot of people who do not."
57,46,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
58,46,The H.P.H.B.E. mask was invented by an American who is against it.

81,46,You think that wearing a mask and bend over is a bit of a stretch?
83,46,"So your dad says that, ""I don't understand how this works in the first place."""
84,46,"Well, you may be confused with the word ‘false’."
87,46,"Vaccination entails that the immune system is unable to keep up with the increasing demand for vaccines, so vaccination may be the only solution to this problem."
90,46,That's an interesting question to ask. You think we should stop dressing as the anti-mawer? Are you in school now?
98,46,I think that it's because people who get tangled up in a mask often wear them.
46,8,Is he a doctor? Because I'm not.
46,12,"I don't think it's all that bad but i feel like some people will have to worry about what they think about Donald Trump, and I still find it rather strange that Trump had to wear a mask at his home to scream at a medical professional."
46,15,> I think we should stop dressing as the anti-mawer? Are you in school now? I think that it's because people who get tangled up in a mask often wear them.
46,16,i was told that a doctor who is a doctor based in the US would prescribe a clot for your cough if you aren't vaccinated against the coronavirus. i thought it was good news that a lot of medical workers were vaccinated against coronavirus.
46,19,He's not a doctor. It's a real threat to your health.
46,24,Is the coronavirus an actual virus?
46,25,You have no idea what is going on here.
46,39,It is quite disturbing to me that we are in a position to try to stop people from using a mask and not to prevent them from being vaccinated.
46,45,I think a mask is an important part of how you fight a disease.
48,46,"I'm not sure I'd be able to do that without the medical equipment that would otherwise be thrown away. But I can get vaccinated at my own place, and with a decent understanding of how to properly protect them."

57,46,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
58,46,"Well, there are many medical workers that don't wear a mask while working, but do wear one when they're stressed - that's what the company is doing. And a doctor who was trained to wear one during surgery and was given no reason to wear one during an accident may also be booted, which may lead to the restraining order."
59,46,The word'mask' came from [the article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mask_spelling).
69,46,"In Georgia, unless someone gets their ends dyed, they can't have children. I understand that he's not saying that, but he doesn't know what to do in this context."

79,46,I think what this guy did in that movie is kind of a shame because the movie explains that a CDC vaccine and mask prevent a lot of people from doing it.
81,46,"""No, I don't like wearing a mask. I want a mask and bend over!"""
83,46,"That makes sense. I think that a person can't force someone else to do something they're not a member of, because it's a negative."
84,46,"Well, i don't think you know the reason. Well, you may be confused with the word 'false'. This is a stupid joke, unless it is about a person wearing a mask. The point of wearing a mask is to encourage more patients to use the healthcare system."

46,15,"I don't know about you but this is definitely a problem. I know we are going to have to get people to wear masks, but if I wanted to fight someone with a tumor I would have to wear masks."
