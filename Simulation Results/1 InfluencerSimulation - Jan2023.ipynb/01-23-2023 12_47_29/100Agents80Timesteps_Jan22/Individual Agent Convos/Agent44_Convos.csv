85,44,well saw my first person get booted out for not keeping their mask on
94,44,huge covid fail to have santa not wearing a mask in thanksgivingdayparade would have been so powerful and such an endorsement of healthcareheroes wearamask
96,44,wrong again brainiac among the reasons for reluctance on the part of some health agencies and places to urge mask wearing is the concern about the shortage of masks for medical workers
44,3,Do you live in the U.S?
44,39,What are your priorities? Your health insurance company?
54,44,The joke is that you can't get a falsehood because you are wearing a mask.
55,44,>How did you get a chance to ride this bike ride in Orlando?
56,44,This is why I wear a mask while working out. Honestly I don't think the mask mandate is being lifted and the vaccination options are still a few weeks out for most of us.
63,44,I never get to know you in detail. This is a good question. It's not my problem at all.
69,44,Tell me something interesting about yourself?

76,44,I've been in a lot of people's jobs and I don't know how to stop them. My fiance and I had a pair of gloves that would stop us from seeing one another. I got to see her again after a while.

96,44,The idea of having a shortage of masks for medical workers is not good.

44,39,"You are wearing a mask, right? You don't want a job in Georgia? Your life depends on that, but you don't like it. Until you go out of your way, don't wear anything."
54,44,I'd say it's just that the coronavirus vaccine is very accepting of mask culture. That's why people keep asking this question when they're not in the same position.

56,44,If you can get the vaccine you do not need to wear a mask. You can also wear a face mask instead.
63,44,Why are you asking this question?
69,44,The law against wearing a mask is not the law against driving a car.
73,44,"In this case, I don't think I could stand wearing a mask. My son has the covid. But it still helps me stop getting the virus."
74,44,This is a good idea.
76,44,">How do you think you can prevent an infection by wearing a mask when you're in a room with someone else?

54,44,CANNOTANSWER:
55,44,"A mask doesn't help stopping a disease because it prevents the spread, and only stops the spread if it's not too spread by the patient, and the vaccine alone isn't effective. It is designed to keep people from getting sick, but it is also effective in keeping people from getting sick."

94,44,It is misleading to say the Humble Covid is being such a bad actor. It isn't an endorsement of healthcare heroes wearamask.
96,44,"People have always had a tendency to think that in the UK they can't wear masks. That's why they do not, but rather, that they can't do so because there are too many meds in the US. This is exactly why we need more meds. I want to see how medical workers and doctors can be more aware of what's going on in their bodies."

85,44,"IANAL, OP:..."
94,44,It's probably more likely that Huge Covid has a mask with a 'torture' - a disguise with a mask on. But he has no interest in being a superhero.

69,44,I think you're being a bit naive. I think you're being a bit dissenting.
73,44,Is this a joke?
74,44,"He doesn't say that the purpose of a mask is to encourage more patients to use the healthcare system, as he's not an expert in medical terminology."
76,44,"I've never had a problem with people using a mask. I've had a lot of people on the Internet who wore masks while the other people were at work. I've had people use masks when I've had people in my office in the past, and it was the only thing that stopped them from ever being around me."
78,44,What's wrong with the word mask? Why is it so commonly used in jokes?
82,44,It's a good way to prevent bodily activity from happening if people are sensitive to heat and heat.
85,44,There are several ways to find a new job.
94,44,"I like to think it's a positive thing to say, because there are a lot of reasons that don't make sense, because even though it's a good thing, it doesn't change the fact that he's trying to be a bad actor or not, that he wants to be a superhero."
96,44,That's not the only thing I'd do about it.

People are very resistant to it and if they don't get vaccinated they will"
78,44,"A bit too big for me - in a little bit I got the impression ""I'm not into it"" was the wrong word. I was more to the point when I felt like I wasn't into sexism and had a really naive idea about the meaning of sexism, that I didn't think I was into it. So it's weird to hear ""I feel the OP is going to be a dick,"" then tell the person ""I don't see the point of making a joke."
82,44,The topic in the article is anti-masked because of the temperature being too hot.
85,44,CANNOTANSWER'S PRESENTATION He's a doctor
94,44,I want to be a superhero. I want to be a superhero.
96,44,That's right. I think the problem is people need to be better informed. But I'm not sure if they want to go to a hospital where people with HIV are actually using it. I think there is a shortage of people on the NHS who need to wear the masks.
44,3,"CANNOTANSWER, the author, has been talking about the topic of vaccinating people in the U.S., with a doctor that is well educated, who doesn't know how to properly handle HIV. Is there a shortage of people on the NHS who need to wear the masks?"
44,39,So CANNOTANSWER and the president are trying to fix the virus. What a fucking dick OP.
54,44,>Cannoneswer is a great senator. How about you?

63,44,CANNOTANSWER AND THE HEALTH OF IT
69,44,"In the US, a guy can be a prankster, but in the comics, it is just that the jokes he makes about it don't mean anything besides insulting the people he fucks. It's probably an insult to someone who is actually wearing a mask and isn't wearing it."

74,44,>Cannotanyer is not a great teacher.
76,44,I know I'm in the wrong subreddit but I don't know why some people are anti-masked and it's not a good idea. I don't think it's weird. I just think that people don't understand why people are so dickish about vaccines. I think that it isn't a bad idea to take a long and complicated road trip without a mask and a smear of your hand in the face. A mask is also a big deal in the US.
78,44,"“““I feel the OP is going to be a dick,”"
82,44,CANNOTANSWER and Cannotanyer are anti-masked fanatics and a doctor.
85,44,"I’m not a lawyer or a lawyer, but I don’t like the lack of masks."

He didn't tell me about his HIV 'cure' until recently, he was in the hospital for a week before being diagnosed. I have since switched back to the US and that is how I was treated. I still think it was an awful situation to go through, but it was probably more than enough for me to make it through to his emergency department to prevent a crisis. Apparently the NHS isn't"
44,3,I don't think we have to do this.
44,39,"I can relate to the whole ""Why did Santa not wear a mask?"" thing. You don't see it as a joke, but as a prankster. It makes you feel as though you are causing trouble. You are not having trouble, and you are not going to change."
54,44,CANNOTANSWER is a great senator. But Donald Trump is one of the people who tries to make him a senator.
55,44,"A friend of mine told me about his favorite thing about wearing a mask at work: that when I sneeze and cough I lose all sense and a fever starts. I thought he said he liked wearing a mask for work, and didn't realize it was a sign that he was going to get a new job. He went into more detail, telling people that the article is a joke. He also said that wearing a mask is incompatible with his job, even if it is actually a sign of a shortage of medical workers. Apparently, this"
56,44,"Is there a reason for the joke he got? It's a joke, not a prank."
63,44,It's just a joke that says nothing - it's the best one you can come up with.
69,44,"It's also because he's not a man, and he's not a politician, he's a prankster. The only time he can even be a prankster is in a movie, which is in the comics. EDIT : [The CDC needs to stop selling the vaccine for a single vaccine, to make it more effective.]"
73,44,I don't like wearing a mask. I'm going to have to be careful.

76,44,I think the people who are apprehensive about vaccines are ignorant about the subject.
78,44,I am going to go with my friends on our first trip to Georgia if they can help me.
82,44,Cannotanyer is an anti-masked fan and a doctor.
85,44,How are you sure you aren't joking?
94,44,"I really like the part where he says that he likes wearing a mask as an affirmative response, that's funny and stupid. I feel that it's an odd way to say, ""I feel like the part that makes you look down on me is what I really think is hilarious about him. It sounds like he's trying to be a bad actor."""

44,39,"This is very interesting. I don't see a very good way to describe the current situation or the fact that this is a joke, but it's like saying you're gonna be a dick and putting the mask on for a while because you're scared that you'll be in the same situation as someone who's had HIV, that the dick you're seeing isn't sick. The dick is in your face. It's not a joke at all."

63,44,There are probably some people that aren't as into health care as IANAL.
69,44,a few of the issues can be tackled by reading the comments below.
73,44,I don't see the problem with having your own face in public - there's a lot of confusion on the issue with having an infected person in public.
74,44,Cannotanyer is a great teacher. He is not a great teacher.
76,44,"The doctor is an anti-masked fan of vaccines, a big fan of the CDC and a big fan of the idea of the medical community seeing people on reddit wearing masks at work. I don't think that people are being dickish about vaccines."
78,44,Is there a reason you feel like you aren't being a dick? Is there any way you can make that comment with your own opinion?
82,44,"Cannotanyer argues that wearing a mask does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it. Cannotanyer has a friend who is an anti-masked fan and a doctor. Cannotanyer also tells the teacher that wearing a mask is not a good idea."
85,44,"There are different types of masks in healthcare, like: 'a mask doesn't cover your face' or 'a mask covers your nose' ('The medical malpractice suit'). You can wear a mask at work and say 'Amamed for a job.'' That way they can talk about how they feel about the situation."
94,44,I don't think it's stupid. It's absurd. And I don't think that I get to say what I want to be.
96,44,The problem is the NHS isn't working because of the shortage of medical workers.
44,3,If I are not wearing a mask and I live in Georgia I will not take a joke about it.
44,39,IANAL is against wearing a mask and that's not a joke.
54,44,"the author of that book is a bit of a hypocrite. I don't like people like 'the mask' though, and it seems more like a fun way to hide an infection."
55,44,CANNOTANSWER TRUST YOU CANNOTANSWER TRUST YOU!'
56,44,"IANAL: Vaccines are not a joke. They are meant to stop people from getting sick. I'm not a doctor, and I’m not asking why they shouldn’t just ban them."
63,44,IANAL does not think the movie is accurate or funny. She thinks it’s interesting and a joke that he thinks is the most frightful.
69,44,I'm confused because I think the question is more about why people are being a prankster.
73,44,"This is all the funniest thing you've ever heard. If he's not infected with covid, he should get a doctor's referral for treatment and they will consider it a ""covid"" vaccine and would do a procedure involving cloning and other cloning methods. I don't know what it really means, but, this isn't the first time a covid is infected. It seems like a fairly common thing for people. '"
74,44,"How about you say, ""I'm a huge fan of Huge Covid and the whole concept of his job, but the fact that he's trying to make people sick. He was going to fuck the nana for a moment but they were referring to a little thing."
76,44,"CANNOTANSWER IS a doctor who is anti-masked if he says I think it's a good idea to wear a mask while working and have people smear in the face, not just on the road when the other people are at work. Vaccines should be banned on the dd oxfam vaccine list. Vaccines should be banned on the dd oxfam vaccine list. Vaccines should be banned on the dd oxfam list. Vaccines should be banned"
78,44,How are you trying to understand how people perceive the message that you are giving?
82,44,I don't think the people who are anti-masked won't stop wearing it because of this.
85,44,"IANAL: 'Hey, what do you think of this virus? I think you'll like a mask. Are you sure you aren't joking? You aren't.'"
94,44,I don't know who that is. I like it.
96,44,"It sounds like the NHS is struggling. If they were giving treatment to more people and they were not properly equipped to treat their patients, the problem would be that they would have to go for a new hospital. This is a huge problem that needs to be addressed."
44,3,CANNOTANSWER'S OWN QUESTIONS:
44,39,I have to disagree with you on the whole question that is being asked.
54,44,"Cannotanyer: CANNOTANSWER : I hate when people wear a mask to get sick. It’s not to stop them from getting better, it’s to stop them from wanting better."

69,44,"When a guy makes jokes about it, it's not really funny."
73,44,I don't want to be a prankster. I'm just expressing my frustration at what this shit does to other people.
74,44,"IANAL is a doctor and I've been given a medical certificate that says I don't wear a mask at work. That's not what a restraining order is. If a restraining order doesn't give the doctor an emergency, he's not entitled to it."
76,44,"I think the main difference is that he is anti-masked for a reason. He can't say it's ""cool"" or something else. He's anti-masked to imply that people aren't working on the health of marijuana."

94,44,That one is not the correct answer. Its not that the other is correct.
96,44,What do you think about a shortage of medics in the UK?
44,3,Cannotanyer has been asked to wear a mask at work but he can't seem to find a job for himself.

55,44,"Tell him you're uncomfortable and he wants to have some sex with you, because he doesn't have to, and you don't want a mask on, which is just ridiculous."
56,44,The joker is a joke and is in no way going to be a doctor if he is a doctor. He is only in the medical field.
63,44,I have to say that I enjoy both of these.
69,44,The CDC is going to have to find out what the Ddoxmm vaccine is.
73,44,"CANNOTANSWER, if you're talking about your son, he's an 'ill-asserted' human being. I'm talking about the man. If the man wants to be as he is in the real world I'd be too ashamed to tell him that he's not infected."
74,44,> I love coaches however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops.

63,44,CANNOTANSWER AND THE HEALTH OF IT
69,44,"CANNOTANSWER is the first person that commented on the article that said there was a problem with the CDC and that they couldn't have the same idea to stop the people from getting the vaccine. They said the CDC needs to stop selling the vaccine for a single vaccine, to make it more effective."
73,44,"It's a joke that you have the right to know. It's not a joke. It's a joke. The problem is, it's not the virus, it's the brain chemistry."
74,44,"So if the medical system isn't providing him with the necessary protections he's supposed to offer, then maybe he shouldn't be a teacher."
