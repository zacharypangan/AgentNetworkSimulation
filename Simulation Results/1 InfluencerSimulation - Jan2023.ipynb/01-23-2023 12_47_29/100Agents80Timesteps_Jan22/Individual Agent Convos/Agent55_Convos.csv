55,44,It is a sign that the United States is infringing on its right to be free from the drug trade.

85,55,"if this were a real case for malpractice, it wouldn't be unprofessional for him to make such a stupid statement at all."
86,55,"I'm a patient and it is a good idea to wear my own mask when I'm sick. I don't know the difference between not working with a doctor and not having to wear a mask. The article is misleading, I think it's a good idea. It's just cheap and comfortable, but not for the sake of looking nice."
89,55,Why do you say this? How did you feel about this?
90,55,Cannotanyer is an anti-masked person.
91,55,"The title is not 'a troll trying to make a buck off the fact that he's an idiot'. It's ""How does the government infringe on its right to our freedom."

91,55,"That's how I am, the trolls are stupid."
55,15,[The truth is that people wear masks in order to hide the viral disease. A woman and a man share a face? And then they're given a mask in order to hide the virus? And then it's the same person? So it seems like he isn't an idiot and he's not trying to tell you something.
