90,16,Cannotanyer doesn't know him.
92,16,I have a really hard time understanding how you'm going to go to the hospital' is not to say they'll not do it. They say that the way they get the vaccination is because it's so easy for the people who are already in the situation. I also mean that when they get that vaccine they have to put on an apron or something because they don't want their health to be destroyed by it.
