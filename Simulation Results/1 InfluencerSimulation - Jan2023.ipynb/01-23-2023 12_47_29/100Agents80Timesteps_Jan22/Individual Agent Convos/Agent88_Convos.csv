It's a bad mask - people are just getting more and more uncomfortable with it and can get angry about it, I don't think it's a good mask to wear - but they like it. I think it's a better mask for the job, and its a great way to get out of stress."
88,56,I have a huge head problem. I've never seen the problem. It happens. When people aren't wearing masks they need to be a little more discreet. I have a really strong head problem. When I wear a mask and I get too nervous I feel like I'm being taken advantage of.
