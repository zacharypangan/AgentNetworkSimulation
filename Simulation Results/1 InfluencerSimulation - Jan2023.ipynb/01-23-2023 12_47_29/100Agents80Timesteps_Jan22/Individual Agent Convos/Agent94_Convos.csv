94,3,No one is going to believe the same thing about the two big pranksters.

94,7,"The big guy in the movie has no mask, just a mask."
94,14,Is this a joke?
94,15,"OP, I am a huge supporter of the holiday holiday party because of their support for them. They would be able to do this despite the huge support of a majority of people. If you want to have a significant impact on your life by giving yourself a mask in December, consider making that a holiday, and then going home in a few weeks to pick up your costume, and then having to wear the mask again for Christmas."

94,3,That movie would have made me think about this a lot more.
94,4,The movie is about a man who doesn't care enough about the santa to make it a superhero movie?
94,6,"""Humble covid""?"
94,7,I think that the movie in the title was misleading because it's about the tv and the costume.
94,14,He doesn't wear a mask. He's wearing a mask to make sure his face looks normal.

94,56,"You want a santa costume tame, right?"
94,57,It sounds like he's being more of a comic book guy than a superhero.

94,84,"It seems like everyone thought he was super hot, so they were worried that the mask was going to cause an outbreak and that the government would make that mistake. He was a bad actor, but not a petty one."
98,94,"What you said is a good idea, and why a large man of ten thousand years would want to wear a mask for a long time. He can fit under him but can't fight because he's over feet tall and there is a difference between being in a short guy's body and being in a big guy's head, and being over feet tall and a woman's face.

94,34,The first three things I've heard in your comment are actually:
94,42,"I think you are right to expect us to agree that a superhero with a mask is an insult to the character's health and morality. If he is trying to convince a woman that he is unable to do a lot of bad things, it's incompatible with being a superhero."
94,44,"The mask doesn't make him a bad actor, it's supposed to make him an actor."
94,45,"I can't understand why everyone would say ""The hat is cool""."
94,49,It sounds like Huge Covid is trying to prove himself as a good guy by using a mask to make you look down on him.
94,52,IANAL is being a dick. I think that you're being really mean and confusing.
94,56,"This guy just isn't good enough. I guess you'd rather it be a ""whoa-whoa-whoa"" sort of thing than a ""whoa-whoa-whoa"" kind of thing."
94,57,I think that you're being really mean and confusing. I think that the whole thing is kind of annoying. I think that 'huge covid fail to have santa not wearing a mask in thanksgivingdayparade would have been so powerful and such an endorsement of healthcareheroes wearamask.
94,60,"The point of a mask is not to 'fuck' Santa, the point is that it is an incredibly stupid and unnecessary way of describing the movie."
94,61,IANAL has nothing to do with the OP.
94,66,"In the movie and in the movie, Huge has a hat with a red beard."
94,72,"A very funny tv show titled ""Hulk's Mask"" that came out on April 9, 2010 will be starring Huge Covid and Amy Klobuchar."
94,74,"The hulk mask is a mask. A little bit like the tinsel-spinning thing, but it's an absolute non-necessary thing to wear. It's a mask that makes people want to be sick."
94,79,"I don't think Huge Covid is that bad actor, but he may be being really mean and misleading. You can be an awkward scummy but he can't be an asshole like he's made it out to be."
94,83,IANAL. I'm really curious if it would help. I think that hulk masks make it more attractive and that a person's body is more prone to sex than a mask.
94,84,">I think that 'the mask is like a dick, but with a nose"
98,94,The title seems a bit scummy. The question is: Why would anyone not wear a hulk mask to protect themselves from contaminated with viruses. Are there any of these a resemblance to an anti-mashing device?
94,3,I don't see why people would complain about Santa not wearing a mask.
94,4,"You don't get to tell them what to say or be an ""asshole."" They're being sarcastic because they're saying the hulk mask is a mask and that it's a good thing for a woman to be a superhero."
94,6,I think there's a reason that people use it to make people sick. They say that it's a hat and that they think it's funny because it's a mask.
94,7,"That is a good idea, but I doubt that is why Santa's not wearing a mask."
94,14,"In the movie ""Hulk's Mask"", Huge says, ""I think the mask is like a dick, but with a nose. I am a physician, but I'm a little worried about that I might get too high, so I guess I'm just going to give it a shot, since it was a nice surprise."""
94,15,I was being a bit harsh.
94,16,"A good superhero is a villain, not a good actor. They make a comic book villain of a villain that looks like they're wearing a mask."
94,21,So what's a good way to describe the character?

94,34,"The first three things are not related, but the fact that the title seems to make sense is interesting to read."
94,42,"The whole ""The hat"" thing is incredibly silly. I find that if the guy is asking ""why doesn't he wear a mask?"" as an affirmative response, it makes him seem to be trying to convince a woman that he's unable to do a lot of bad things. It's just weird that he's trying to convince a woman he's unable to do a lot of bad things."

The kind you see on TV and in comics - ""why didn't Santa wear a mask"" - are basically things that are supposed to go into the character's head.

94,7,>I don't think you're being really mean and confusing.
94,14,IANAL: I think it's silly that he didn't have a mask because he sounds incredibly funny.
94,15,"I like to play santa, but I can't remember the part about Santa wearing a mask, which made me laugh out loud."
94,16,I think this is a great analogy for all of this.
94,21,"You should also know that this is a movie and the people who have viewed it as a way to get into the movie can't use it in real life, but it is a movie, so the people who see this movie tend to not give it enough thought."
94,22,"""Mom, if a person who likes to have a hat on Santa, they shouldn't be wearing one."""
94,23,"CANNOTANSWER OP: I think that he is trying to be a superhero. I think that he is trying to be a superhero, because he grew up doing. It was probably just an absurd analogy, a huge one despite being a doctor."
94,24,"The problem is not your mom's, but that's a huge reason to say ""I don't think it's a problem because I don't like wearing a mask""."
94,34,CANNOTANSWER OP: I think that he is trying to be a doctor. I think that's one of the biggest dreads of my life and I want to be a superhero.
94,42,"It isn’t a good analogy. It’s just it works, and it doesn’t make sense to the viewer, especially if the underlying concept is faulty."
94,44,"The movie is about the Doctor and the Humble Covid. It is about a doctor who uses a mask to make people sick. It does not seem like it has much of a purpose. IANAL. It is about a doctor, not an actual actor, but a supposedly abusive one. It is probably just an absurd analogy, but it doesn’t make sense. I think that “make” is about a Doctor whose job is to make people sick."
94,45,"i think he's trying to make some kind of weird movie called ""The Doctor and the Humble Covid"" or something like that.. I feel like they both need to be a part of it.."
94,49,There is no single reason why Huge Covid is attempting to be a hero.
94,52,Isn't a doctor's job more likely to lead to a heart attack? Is it possible to get into a relationship with one's doctor?
94,56,"I'm going to be op's mom and tell her that you don't understand the concept of a ""Humble"" analogy as to the problem of a doctor doing a medical malpractice if you don't agree with it. That's the kind of analogy she's going to use when she finds out."
94,57,IANAL: I don't think I'm a good person.
94,60,The movie is about a doctor who uses a mask to make people sick. It does not seem like it has much of a purpose.
94,61,Is it still a movie?
94,66,"""Ahh, that makes me sad. I think there is a way of dressing as a superhero. But I don't know how to do it. I think it is more appropriate than a mask."""
94,72,I'm sorry but I don't want to go to the r/dc/homework and I'm just going to put in the effort to help.
94,74,[Ask Santa to do a mask in a movie about a doctor's job and he's trying to get people sick](https://www.ncf.org/health-science/future/dp-pheonix/dksseft/dk/fsss/fsssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
94,79,"IANAL explains his reasoning that he can’t wear a mask. He is an actor. He’s trying to be a superhero. He’s making a movie about a doctor who uses a mask to make people sick. He says, ""I think that’s a really good thing and I think that I can be a superhero."""
94,83,"I think you should be getting into a discussion, then talk to your doctor about the mask and whether or not it's actually a good idea."
94,84,In regards to the 'thing' that makes the picture creepy?
98,94,"""Hulk masks are great. They help with the swelling, but they don't help with the sensitivity and sensitivity, or if they give you less sensitivity to fight it."", '""The problem is not that they are useful for protecting the skin from contaminated with viruses.', """
94,3,"> ""I think that if we grew up surrounded by Hulk's parents for years, we'd start using ""Hulk"" and ""Ged"" instead."
94,4,"A fucking dick with no nose, because a bad actor."
94,6,"That's what I think when I write a response. I think it's funny that you think he's trying to be a doctor, because the santa mask doesn't get a good td, but the thing is that it's a mask."
94,7,"I think your mom doesn't know if she is right or wrong about the movie or whether she doesn't know if she is right. She is not wrong and she is confused about it because she is. So she is correct. santa has no dick, but no nose. It doesn't even have a nose."
94,14,"I think it's not being funny at all. Especially as an aside - he's been trying to be a hero for a while now, as a guy. So he didn't seem a good fit to have a mask and he seems like a prick trying to be a hero. I don't think he's trying to make a good hero, but it's still a dreadful movie, and I don't like his name but he didn't feel that way about it and"
94,15,"I feel like the hat was a good analogy. He's trying to be a superhero, he's trying to be a hero and a doctor is trying to make people sick."
94,16,"> ""But I'm going to put in the effort to help."
94,21,">I don't know how to do it. I think it’s more appropriate than a mask. I think that 'the mask is like a dick, but with a nose. I like it as an affirmative response. I think that 'Hulk masks make it more attractive and that person's body is more prone to sex than a mask. I think that 'hulk masks make it more attractive and that person's body is more prone to sex than a mask.'"
94,22,The problem is not that they are useful for protecting the skin from viruses.
94,23,"“I think if he wants to be a superhero, he should do so. And if he doesn’t, it’s probably not a good idea.”"
94,24,"It seems that the 'adalyst' is a r/ncf based thing that the OP said is incredibly confusing and is just going to make it easier for your child to understand. IANAL also sounds like he is trying to make you look down on him, because he is trying to make people sick, and he is trying to make people sick by making people sick. This is not normal and he is trying to be a doctor, it is a r/ncf and he is going to have to explain to him,"
94,34,">A lot of people have a hat problem, that's why you have hats."
94,42,"IANAL's post makes sense, but a lot of his post makes you wonder: Is it possible for a doctor who uses a mask to get people sick?"
94,44,"IANAL, you're not confused OP, you're confused OP. ""How come you see he doesn't want to be a hero,"" ""What is a dick, but with a nose."" ""How can you fit a mask on Santa? I can't think of any dicks for Santa. I can't think of any."""
94,45,"CANNOTANSWER OP: I think that he is trying to be a hero. It is probably just an absurd analogy, but it doesn't make sense. It is probably just an absurd analogy, but it doesn't make sense. It isn't a good analogy, but it doesn't make sense. It is probably just an absurd analogy, but it doesn't make sense to the viewer."
94,49,I don't really understand what you mean.
94,52,IANAL (the writer) was being a bit too specific.
94,56,"IANAL: This OP is being really mean and confusing. It sounds like he wants to make a movie about a doctor, and it sounds like he's trying to make people feel more comfortable. I think the whole thing is kind of annoying."
94,57,"""There is no single reason why he is trying to be a superhero."
94,60,The title of the post implies that a person is trying to be a doctor.
94,61,"I like to say that I think it's a lot better to just be a superhero than to have a mask on. I feel like that would be a great way to let people know I don't have an unhealthy dislike of the man, and I'd be willing to work harder to make it more popular if I did."
94,66,“The movie is about a doctor who uses a mask to make people sick. It does not seem like it has much of a purpose. It does not seem like it has much of a purpose.”
94,72,>It's an amazing analogy.
94,74,"I don't know what an abusive doctor is, but he makes a great doctor. I'm sure he's willing to do something to prevent infection. I don't want to be a doctor."
94,79,>He didn't say a word about his job. Because he's been making a movie about a doctor whose job is to make people sick. It does not seem like it has much of a purpose.
94,83,I'm a doctor and a doctor who wears a mask all the time. But I feel that the same things in my mind that I would use a mask.
94,84,I know one doctor who uses a mask to help protect people but that's all the time I've ever had a serious issue with.
98,94,">""Why would anyone not wear a hat to prevent you from getting contaminated with viruses."","
