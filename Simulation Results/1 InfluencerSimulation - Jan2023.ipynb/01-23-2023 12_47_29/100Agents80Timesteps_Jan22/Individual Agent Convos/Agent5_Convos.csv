21,5,"In a nutshell, why doesn't your kid get a vaccine and go to the vet to get it?"
27,5,"No, but why not do it yourself. You're all about protecting yourself. If you're in a dangerous situation, you may as well do something about it. But that's one thing, that's a little ridiculous, and we're all against it."

58,5,"""Why don't health workers be prepared for a cold or flu? Wearing masks does not help, it's useless and I hate it."
62,5,How do you feel about this?
65,5,I am really not interested in doing any of that. It is not what it's supposed to be.
66,5,It's crazy how many people don't wear masks because they are so uncomfortable and unnatural.
69,5,Are you a fan of the movies?
72,5,"Wearing a mask is a very valid reason. If your employer is actually paying for the mask, it's not going to make any difference. That is why the job seeker must hire someone who knows the difference between a covid mask and a standard mask."
78,5,"Isn't Georgia an extremely large state of Georgia? I'm not sure what the rest of Georgia looks like, but I think Georgia is very close."
86,5,"This isn't how the government treats workers. They're saying it's unfair that people have to wear masks to protect themselves against the virus. It's a common misconception that people who can't stand working outside a day work outside a day. The Government is using the ""Microsoft"" masks to guard against the viruses."

21,5,CANNOTANSWER: I'm a doctor and I want to prevent the spread of the virus. It's really a strange issue. It's really sad how the politicians of the u.s. have not had that opportunity to do anything they want to.

86,5,"I know a woman who likes to go out of her way to get help and do her job with a mask, but I am always under the impression that they would be helpful. I don't get how many doctors I see and even if they did they would be able to tell who is sick. They would have to take care of all of it."

7,5,">I think the problem is that wearing masks is important for preventing the spread of the virus. Vaccines are important to combat the problem, but the problem is that most people will ignore them for fear of the spread of the virus."
21,5,CANNOTANSWER: What kind of things can I do to prevent it from happening to me?
27,5,I'd rather not go to a doctor for my doctor's appointment and not to have a doctor.
36,5,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
42,5,"> ""What's the reason that you are being criticized for wearing a mask at work?"" I just want to say something, but the joker isn't very good at explaining why you should not be wearing a mask. I'm very sorry. I'm an avid paintball player. Are you sure you're not a zombie? Because that's not your problem. You can't have a mask without being a zombie. I've got some very old viruses but have never been vaccinated against them."

I am not a doctor and I do not know the exact nature of the situation but I wish I was.

Because that's not a funny answer."
58,5,"...but i can't imagine what's going on here? oh absolutely not public is being asked to make their own masks or use a scarf my concern then and now is every medical mask worn in public is one that is not available for a health worker who needs it desperately The H.P.H.B.E. mask was invented by an American who is against it.

62,5,Why are you wearing a mask? 'People are very resistant to the virus and if they do not get vaccinated they are unlikely to die. You have the right to be offended.
65,5,> We do not believe in a mask.
66,5,I think you're going to have to get that on a big scale. You're just trying to force the issue of masked people to stop wearing them. You need to be respectful of these people and the health system.
69,5,I'm really glad that you answered my question.
72,5,This is a valid reason to wear a mask. Wearing a mask at work is uncomfortable.
78,5,"When I am going to Georgia, I feel like there isn't enough time to make a joke about how I'm in Georgia. When I'm going to Georgia, I feel like my shit is so much better than yours."
86,5,"> what's the problem with wearing masks? I don't understand why. When you go to medical offices, you might also want to ask your doctor why you didn't try to have a doctor come for you. We have to keep masks on the workers. Isn't wearing a mask a sign of a lack of masks for medical workers?"
92,5,So you want to go to the hospital?

21,5,Who doesn't want Santa to have a mask because Santa would have a bad time?
27,5,CANNOTANSWER: The fact that the mayor of the county did not sign a bill to remove the requirement of a mask from the public health order seems odd to me.

65,5,That's a very valid point. But I'm not sure if this is actually true....and then you're still talking about...
