63,61,why do people keep asking this yes i ve had multiple exposures in tight places no mask long time periods like an hour i never get it
75,61,thank u for wearing a mask and being smart unfortunately trump showed no effort to set an example to suppress the spread he dismissed the threat and millions who sit on his every word followed his lead magats think it s a hoax while people are dying each day from it
81,61,please wear a mask amp bend over

61,4,I have a very hard time sat through the whole thread despite a mask and a few people pointing it out. We can only hope that that mask mandate will never be lifted.
61,7,I’m actually wondering what the truth is about a person who can’t wear a mask when the mask mandate isn’t lifted and accessible vaccines are still a few weeks out for most of us
61,21,"ah i see, its a good one"
61,22,"Now if the MMR mandate were lifted, we would all be able to use vaccines for all. What do you want to do if you aren't already wearing a mask?"
61,24,You know what's more hilarious than the other one?
61,26,I don't think we really need the vaccination and vaccine mandate to work. I think you gotta stop trying to figure out the exact reason you don't wear a mask. You're the one who will make a difference
61,30,But you don't actually get the vaccines for the two days after your birthday?
61,35,"The mask mandate isn't lifted, but it isn't in place yet and the vaccines aren't accessible yet. It's been a while since I've seen a picture of the mask mandate going on in my head and I've been so concerned that it's now being lifted that I haven't gotten a chance to do it as it is."

61,24,It's about the santa mask for the halloween parade! I know everyone else thinks it's a bad idea but I'm sure that the public is still interested in them and is ready to go see them all. It's too early to know.

61,41,"Well, the mask mandate isn't lifting yet. Vaccines are still on the market because the mandate isn't lifted yet. It's not lifted now."
61,43,"So you think that vaccines are a good thing to prevent, and have the same impact on the lives of children?"
61,56,I think that would be hilarious but that is really funny to see.
61,57,This is the last part of the wiki article where santa isn't wearing a mask. It's very very obvious that he's wearing it to prevent the santa from wearing it.

61,43,"Aye, I'm pretty happy he isn't wearing a mask. He's also using a mask that's too expensive for me to use..."
61,56,"I don't really know if you can get that up, but you're being a dick about it. You are not being funny, and I am getting frustrated that you are trying to take a joke as funny.

61,41,"It's a joke, the doctor is making a bad joke, a joke about being a doctor."
61,43,IANAL. The joke is funny and a pity.

61,59,"The most important thing is to remember that the mask was made by a doctor and it has an adverse effect on someone's health, and there's no harm in it."
63,61,I think the book can be viewed as a good solution because of the fact that there are people who wear masks every day to save themselves from the health problems that might come up in the future. I also think a good idea to make this up is to find someone who doesn't go to a doctor to do it. I have not been involved in any serious cases of sarcasm.

61,43,A friend of mine who is a medical professional is a doctor. He has been the only one to wear the hulk mask and it has been the only one he's ever ever been to.
