69,31,You have to wear a mask while on the job and if you wear a mask if you are injured you will lose your job.

69,43,"I'm not sure what is really going on here, but I heard the truth. There are plenty of reasons to don't wear a mask, I am not sure what the real reason would be. But I am not sure where you could see a movie of them."
69,44,I'm confused because I think this guy is so dissenting.
69,46,"In Georgia, unless someone gets their ends dyed, they can't have children. I understand that he's not saying that, but he doesn't know what to do in this context."
