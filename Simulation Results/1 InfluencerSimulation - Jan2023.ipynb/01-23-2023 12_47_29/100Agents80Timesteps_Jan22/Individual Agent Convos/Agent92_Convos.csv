92,5,I'm wearing a mask and I'm going to the hospital. I'm not afraid of being in an auto accident.
92,14,This is going to be a big deal.
92,16,I have a really hard time understanding how you'm going to go to the hospital' is not to say they'll not do it. They say that the way they get the vaccination is because it's so easy for the people who are already in the situation. I also mean that when they get that vaccine they have to put on an apron or something because they don't want their health to be destroyed by it.
92,26,"I'm assuming you mean that because the world isn't over yet, the world will never be over yet."
92,36,"CANNOTANSWER FUCK YOU OP! What is your favorite color? You're a little nervous. If you can't afford to wear a mask, do not use it."

99,92,I think that it isn't a bad idea to take a long and complicated road trip on a motorcycle or bicycle trip without a mask and a smear of your hand in the face. A mask is also a big deal in the US.

92,36,"There is nothing about the vaccine, it's not about preventing them from getting it. You are being a sarcastic, over-reactionist jerk."
92,39,Yes. It's a bad thing. I don't even want to be in a situation that will re-establish a good relationship with the person who is getting the vaccine. I have a friend with an asthmatic asthmatic friend with a panic attack who was vaccinated because he feared that it would make him sick and he would be in a terrible position to have to go to the ER and have him take antibiotics.

92,71,I didn’t mean to imply that the people involved in this situation are going to get to go through with getting vaccinated unless they are being treated for covid. I meant to say that when the pandemic is over (in a word) there is no way for them to possibly have the effect of getting vaccinated.
