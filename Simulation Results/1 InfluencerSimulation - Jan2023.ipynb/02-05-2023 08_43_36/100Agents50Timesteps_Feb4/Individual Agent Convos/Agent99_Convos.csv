99,9,You wear a mask? I wore one last year but nobody liked it at all. I don't understand why anyone would wear one when you're in a hurry to get into that kind of situation.
99,18,I wore my mask when I was in high school. I thought it was a lot of fun to be around.
99,21,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having 
99,28,You can't have a bad time in a community where a public health official is unable to wear a mask. You can only have one bad day in a community where a public health official has a mandate to be wearing a mask.
99,33,You're going to end up getting your mask a lot more often. You can't really say that you're trying to tell them to stop. I hope you're right.
99,47,"Oh my gosh, I am a big fan of masks, I am a big fan of masks."
99,50,oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that oh you dont like wearing your mask maro
99,51,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
99,60,"I like wearing masks and I feel a lot better with them, but I don't want to be a dick about the karma."
99,63,i was trying to put that in context but it wasn't quite right
99,67,I'm a vaccinated person and my doctor told me I should wear a mask when I was born because of a virus.
99,73,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having 
99,76,It sounds like you've got it right.
99,77,"Oh, fuck that."
99,79,So they don't want to tell maroon to suck at it. It's just an idea that they're afraid to do.
99,80,I'm so sick of seeing a guy wearing masks.
99,86,i mean i'm pretty sure that maroon's had a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that
99,87,"i have a friend who is very sick of being unable to breathe. he has no experience with sex, and only has a hard time breathing since and no one wants to talk about that he also has trouble breathing."
99,89,"This is a topic that should be brought up at any one time or another, right?"
99,98,i don't know why that makes a difference to the conversation. i just thought maroon had a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that. i have no idea why that s called that
100,99,>I'll not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask
99,4,"I'm a guy in high school. He was in a mask and I was a big fan of it but I didn't really like wearing it. He has been having trouble breathing since but no one wants to talk about that. I am not a big fan of the word that Maroon, that's a shit thing. I'm a big fan of the stuff that is so obscure."
99,9,"The government doesn't want to make a person's nosebleed' by telling them to suck at a shittiness because it's a public health official who wants to keep his nose open while everyone else is in a rush. Then they get a shittiness. So they're going to want the shittiest person to be around them, not everyone."
99,18,"This is a topic that should be brought up at any one time or another, right?"
99,21,This guy is going to talk about the health benefits of wearing a mask. I wonder how hard that guy's hard time breathing would be if he was only wearing masks at one time in his life. I would really like to hear how this guy is having a hard time breathing and he's feeling better. Maybe he's just looking for some help. I've had some very good friends who have been to hospital. I would have been more than happy to have a doctor help them with a difficult or hard time breathing.
99,28,I think if someone had an attitude like this I'd be pretty uncomfortable with it because I was afraid they'd get upset and I'd hate to get them involved in the next phase of that conversation.
99,33,"You're coming across as an unintelligible dick. What about a fucking black man? I don't even know what he's doing. What he is doing is an understatement and it doesn't seem like that's a good thing, because it sounds like he doesn't even understand that he's going to do that. That he's wearing a mask is not that great. I want a mask, I'm not in a black man. That's my problem. Is there a"
99,47,"I wore a mask when I was in high school. I thought it was a lot of fun to be around. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. I like wearing masks and I feel a lot better with them, but I don't want to be a dick about the karma."
99,50,"Why are you getting this? Do you think they're able to tell people the truth or are just in agreement with what you're saying? Because if you don't, you can't tell people."
99,51,He didn't get a mask until he got his first vaccine. He never said he should wear it.
99,60,"Well I'm really not a big fan of a lot of things, so I'm just being a narcissistic prick who has to be told not to wear a mask."
99,63,I'm not saying it's wrong or that it's a good idea or that it's just a bad idea or bad idea but a nice way of presenting it to a person.
99,67,"I've read that a lot of people equate wearing a mask with ""sick"" sex."
99,73,I'm getting ready to leave.
99,76,It seems like they don't want to tell me maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that. It's just an idea that they're afraid to do.
99,77,Is it possible that you were born without a mask or that he was unable to wear a mask?
99,79,"I'm not sure what I'm talking about, but I think the government in the US is pretty insensitive to women wearing masks. They don't seem to care much about their jobs."
99,80,I'm sure you've got it right.
99,86,"I think it's a pretty good point. That's kind of a general misconception, but there's an underlying message to this post that isn't going to get much attention."
99,87,I was a narcissist who was allergic to a couple of septic shocks and a thigh ache in my teens.
99,89,"I don't understand what the problem is. I mean, there is some common sense in the people in that position:"
99,98,"I would hate to read this. But I know that this was a joke. I could not relate to the comment because I was like, ""Oh, fuck that. I'm sick of seeing a guy wearing masks. '"
100,99,Isn't that why the state has mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters? Because it makes people less prone to contract and vaccinating.
99,4,I read a lot of hacked comments like this. I don't see why they would care about any issues other than just the physicality of the topic.
99,9,I feel like a little bit of the above is a little redundant.
99,18,[NAME] and [NAME] talk about a guy having a hard time breathing.
99,21,"I ain't just being narcissistic. It's a serious illness that needs a doctor to treat it. People need to be well informed about what's going on, especially on their own, and that's why it's the first thing that comes to mind."
99,28,"""I was a narcissist who was allergic to a couple of septic shocks and a thigh ache in my teens. I don't understand what the problem is."
99,33,"I don't think the government has a ""toy"" for ""sick"" sex?"
99,47,"Its about the government, not your masks."
99,50,"> Because if you don't, you can't tell people."
99,51,"I'm sorry, but this is a silly joke that's not about the mask. The joke is about the masks being used as protection against a virus. This is a topic that should be brought up at any time or another, right?"
99,60,"I don't have any other problems here, but I have a little friend who is pretty much the same as me who's in a narcissistic state and is allergic to the virus. His family is a big fan of the disease, so I can't even comment on his ""advantages."""
99,63,Vaccination is actually pretty good for preventing the spread of a virus.
99,67,"People can be narcissistic about it, but not the right one."
99,73,So the guy is wearing a mask?
99,76,>Isn't that why the state has mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters? Because it makes people less prone to contract and vaccinating.
99,77,>I think the government in the US is pretty insensitive to women wearing masks. They don't seem to care much about their jobs.
99,79,The state has mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters? Because it makes people less prone to contract and vaccinating.
99,80,"Its the ejaculation of the ejaculation and the fear of getting sick, which is what a lot of people don't understand. It's like putting on the mask to protect you from the sun from the sun, and then letting them go."
99,86,"So, they are just saying that women have to wear masks for fear of the stigma that it will cause?"
99,87,There is a reason why you can't tell people the truth.
99,89,I've got a question. What is the big deal?
99,98,>Isn't that why the state has mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters? Because it makes people less prone to contract and vaccinating.
100,99,"Yes, because they want people to get an ""event"" (and no one will be vaccinated)."
99,4,The CDC has stated that a lot of people in the US are allergic to HIV.
99,9,"I don't get it. It's a real issue, not an excuse. People can be narcissistic. It's a serious illness that needs a doctor to treat it. People need to be well informed about what's going on, especially on their own, and that's why it's the first thing that comes to mind."
99,18,"I don't think there's any point in bringing up ""sick sex"" like a funny joke."
99,21,This is one of the top three things to post in the last few months.
99,28,">I don't think the government has a ""toy"" for ""sick"" sex? Its about the government, not your masks."
99,33,"They have mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters. Because it makes people less prone to contract and vaccinating. Its the ejaculation of the ejaculation and the fear of getting sick, which is what a lot of people don't understand. Its like putting on the mask to protect you from the sun from the sun, and then letting them go."
99,47,"They're all stupid. Why not make this more relevant? If you don't like them, tell them. Or if you want to be the best and just stay a dick about it, stop making the point. It's just about the government."
99,50,"> Because if you don't, you can't tell people."
99,51,What kind of doctor is it? It would really be something to be worried about if it was a virus. It's really not about a mask. It's about the people who are not going to be able to do it.
99,60,"I had a similar reaction to a quote from the wiki article: ""They say that women have to wear masks for fear of the stigma that it will cause? There is a reason why you can't tell people the truth. I've got a question. What is the big deal?"
99,63,This is why a lot of the commenters are not as sensitive to women as other commenters are to the mask.
99,67,The issue is that people don't like the idea of wearing a mask.
99,73,"People don't really get that it's an 'event'. There are plenty of health benefits associated with it, and there is a large amount of evidence that there is actually evidence for that and it has a lot to do with the idea of the mask being worn."
99,76,"In the United States, all vaccinating the person is mandatory. So there's an important distinction between not being able to use one or not. You're not required to wear a mask, but you have to be able to do so at any time."
99,77,It's a funny joke. It's because that's the reason people don't want to know.
99,79,"As an American, I am interested in how this one's interpretation of sex sex is used, but I am not a big fan of these petty jokes about the government's policies. Its a stupid statement, but it is very silly."
99,80,Are you saying they aren't actually going to stop the spread of a virus? Because they are.
99,86,I have a good laugh if this is true.
99,87,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
99,89,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
99,98,It is so sad that we continue to be slapped in the face with the worst things in the world.
100,99,"We have to make sure people have vaccines, and they will do so in our state"
99,4,Because we are not immune to HIV.
99,9,"Unless you have a doctor who cares about you and is a nurse, it's not going to stop this from happening."
99,18,"A very funny thing is the government does not want to get into the details of people having to be vaccinated for anything, even if that's the actual cause."
99,21,"So, if you like these comments, tell them to stop making the comments."
99,28,"The ""toy"" for sex is about the government, not your masks. They have mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters. Because it makes people less prone to contract and vaccinating. Its the ejaculation of the ejaculation and the fear of getting sick, which is what a lot of people don't understand. Its like putting on the mask to protect you from the sun from the sun, and then letting them go."
99,33,"Apparently you have to show them that you have a mask so they can have an anti-virus, so you can prevent infections and prevent the spread of other diseases. You're telling them that this is a bad idea but they don't have a mask. They are being criticized and abused by the media. It's not about the masks, it's about the people. This is a really sad, scary, and scary thing. You're not telling people."
99,47,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I like wearing a mask and I feel a lot better with them, but I don't want to be a dick about the karma."", 'Its about the government, not your masks.', ""They're all stupid. Why not make this more relevant? If you don't like them, tell them. Or if you want to be the best and just stay a dick about it."
99,50,"People who are not comfortable with masks being worn are likely to be affected by the CDC, and hence are at greater risk for getting a vaccine for a virus that has already been screened."
99,51,"OP has a good point, but I think the point is that the government should keep it on the side of the people, as the public has to know what the people who are going to get sick might do to protect themselves from the vaccinated ones."
99,60,"As a woman, I would not want to be the rabidly anti-virus nut. I'd rather be in the habit of not having a vaccinated child and not wanting to have to go to an infection prone doctor for help with your health."
99,63,"They do not need to get anyone to wear a mask, they need to have their doctor to do it. It's a very stupid thing to say about what people don't want to know."
99,67,"I was wondering why the government was required to wear a mask, so the OP isn't making a joke."
99,73,So they say it is a funny joke?
99,76,"Vaccination is a medical necessity, it entails getting vaccinated. It's the way a patient dies, it's the way a patient is vaccinated and not their health."
99,77,"Well, it's a fun thing to say and I know they are."
99,79,I think this is the most basic and relevant answer to this question: How is it affecting you?
99,80,This is one of the most depressing and disturbing things that ever happened in the US.
99,86,"It's a joke, it's a statement. But why don't you talk about the underlying message?"
99,87,It is sad that we continue to be slapped in the face with the worst things in the world.
99,89,I can't get enough of that stuff in the US.
99,98,It's a petty joke. But there are some good ones here.
100,99,The problem with it is that it's not mandated by the government and is completely illegal.
99,4,That isn't a joke.
99,9,"There's actually a very interesting piece by the author, and I like it very much. I'm wondering if the person 'wearing a mask' is a joke, or something else."
99,18,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
99,21,"You know the joke. You can't just say ""oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that"""
99,28,The government should keep it on the side of the people and tell people that they can't be abused or criticized because it is a joke.
99,33,This is a lot of nefarious shit.
99,47,"I think the point is that the government should keep it on the side of the people, as the public has to know what the people who are going to get sick might do to protect themselves from the vaccinated ones."
99,50,"They threw their masks and pigeons in there. But I'm sure they don't want them in the same situation as their parents or parents. It seems like they are trying to get people to do a job they love, but they won't."
99,51,"Vaccination is a medical necessity, it entails getting vaccinated."
99,60,"There's an article from 2006 that says it's not a joke, but a joke..."
99,63,This is the point that you're making.
99,67,"Vaccination is a medical necessity, it entails getting vaccinated. Its the way a patient dies, it's the way a patient is vaccinated and not their health."
99,73,"It's not a joke, it's a petty statement. What a great joke and why do you need to talk about the underlying message?"
99,76,"Vaccination is a medical necessity, it entails getting vaccinated."
99,77,"I've had the same experience with the CDC's policy of requiring people not to wear masks at all, regardless of the reasons they were there to prevent people from getting sick."
99,79,The US government's propaganda against women is just as depressing and disturbing as any other country
99,80,"A government sponsored vaccine that has been used in Africa for nearly 2 generations has also resulted in a lot of deaths. Its a joke, but isn't a joke."
99,86,"A petty joke, it's a statement, but the people who want to make them know have to make them."
99,87,"Vaccination is a medical necessity, it entails getting vaccinated. Its the way a patient dies, it's the way a patient is vaccinated and not their health."
99,89,It is sad that we continue to be slapped in the face with the worst things in the world. It's a petty joke. But why don't you talk about the underlying message?
99,98,"No, but this is why the government is mandated to get people to be vaccinated, not for it. They are exposing the government to karma, and if they think it's a joke, then they're not even in the minority to have it."
100,99,">I'm pretty sure that if you can't go to the twitchcon event without a mask, it's almost certainly gonna end with a lot of lawsuits. If the fbi is going to get to the twitchcon event and the states don't have the mandate for it to have one."
99,4,I agree with the others. The only thing that is missing is that this message has been around for years. I know the CDC is going to have to change it.
99,9,"So in a case of the public being slapped in the face by the government, I'm going to cite your experience as a example of the government making a joke about a government-sponsored vaccine that was developed in a public health facility."
99,18,"I think you can't just say ""oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that"""
99,21,"Vaccination is a medical necessity, it entails getting vaccinated. There's an article from 2006 that says it's not a joke, but a joke."
99,28,"That doesn't mean they shouldn't have a job, because of all the laws about the government's anti-vaccination policy."
99,33,Is it really the fbi or the CDC that can be blamed for these things and keep them on the side of the people?
99,47,"I think the point of the article is that the government should keep it on the side of the people, and tell people that they can't be abused or criticized because it is a joke."
99,50,"""But I'm sure they don't want them in the same situation as their parents or parents. It seems like they are trying to get people to do a job they love, but they won't."
99,51,"I know that's funny. If I were on the side of people I would never get sick, as a joke. I was just about to say this:"
99,60,"I'm not getting what your pointing at, but the premise is the same. I'm trying to convey the message."
99,63,"I have a copy of the CDC article that says it's not a joke, but a joke..."
99,67,"If you're not making a joke, then you're not making a joke. If you haven't made a joke about it, then you're making a joke about it."
99,73,So you know the joke... the joke?
99,76,My point is that this is a petty joke.
99,77,The government is insensitive to women wearing masks because of their lack of protection from the virus.
99,79,A government sponsored vaccine that has been used in Africa for nearly 2 generations has also resulted in a lot of deaths.
99,80,"This is not a joke, that's just not a joke, and people need to know what to do."
99,86,"It seems like a joke. They are trying to get people to do a job they love, but they won't."
99,87,"Vaccination is a medical necessity, it entails getting vaccinated. Its the way a patient dies, it's the way a patient is vaccinated and not their health. Its a joke, but a petty statement."
99,89,"No, but this is why the government is mandated to get people to be vaccinated, not for it."
99,98,"The whole Vaccination is a Medical Needs and you are a doctor, but that isn't a joke at all."
100,99,Vaccination is not required by the government and is illegal. They are the most liberal and progressive anti-vaccine movement.
99,4,The article states the public has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that.
99,9,"Vaccination is not a medical necessity, it entails getting vaccinated. There's an article from 2006 that says it's not a joke, but a joke. That doesn't mean they shouldn't have a job, because of all the laws about the government's anti-vaccine policy. Is it really the fbi or the CDC that can be blamed for these things and keep them on the side of the people?"
99,18,"Isn't it a very funny thing that the government should bring up health issues, which is why they were 'assholes'? What a silly thing to say!"
99,21,I'm actually a little surprised by the amount of comments that are being made by people that don't follow the definition of a joke.
99,28,I can't see how this would get any better if people wouldn't take it as a joke. It's probably just because it's not the most important aspect of the article.
99,33,If you're thinking of the way that they are being abused. It doesn't sound like they understand that it is just a joke.
99,47,"I have a copy of the CDC article that says it's not a joke, but a joke. The CDC is blaming women wearing masks because they can't get their child vaccinated and that means that if they didn't know the facts about their child they would get their child vaccinated."
99,50,It would be great for me to be the only one to call the CDC a joke that is not about the government.
99,51,There's a video of this guy demonstrating why he needs to be vaccinated. I was just about to say he just cried.
99,60,[Dave] A lot of people are sick with the flu and we all are.
99,63,">I think you can't just say ""oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that"" Vaccination is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I think you can't just say ""oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that"" Vaccination is actually pretty good for preventing the spread of a virus."
99,67,I think it’s interesting that there are so many examples of people using a mask as a tool for preventing a virus from spreading. This kind of joke is common.
99,73,"It's not a joke, it's just a joke. You are on the side of people and it is the government that is trying to get people to do a job they love."
99,76,"The point of the article is that the government should keep it on the side of the people, and tell people that they can't be abused or criticized because it is a joke."

100,99,This whole movement is trying to eschew the need for more states. This is how they are changing the law.
99,4,You're right about the CDC being a joke. It's not just the people who are trying to get the flu out of their country but the people who actually have an attitude that has been a joke.
99,9,People in this thread are being told to be vaccinated before the vaccine is administered. You might want to consider reading a few other posts.
99,18,"It is a very simple thing to bring up, but I think it needs to be a lot more complex. The CDC is basically being an asshole for calling it a joke. They're not trying to be a joke, they're trying to put it in writing as a joke."

99,47,Vaccination is really something that has been on our agenda for so long - so many Americans haven't gotten vaccines. Not sure how to describe it. There's even a movie about that.
99,50,There are so many things that are in the CDC:
99,51,The fact that people are being treated with a mask is not an accurate indicator of how serious a problem is in the medical community.
99,60,Is the CDC doing any more research on what a good time of the year is? Is it just a joke? The whole thing is a joke. It's a very important part of the government's policy - to protect the public.
99,63,>The CDC is blaming women wearing masks because they can't get their child vaccinated and that means that if they didn't know the facts about their child they would get their child vaccinated.

99,77,"The most outrageous and hilarious thing I read on reddit is the ""honey-moon hats"" sarcastic satire: ""I know that it's a joke. It's a joke, but it's not a joke. It's a joke, but it's the joke that is making it."""
99,79,That is what I believe is a common joke.

99,87,"If a doctor told someone to have their child vaccinated, there was a chance the doctor would find the virus."
99,89,The only way to protect us is to protect ourselves in the face of the reality that we are a human being in the face of a serious illness.

99,33,"I'm a woman and a man and I think you're right. They're being criticized and abused by the media. I don't think people understand that their mother is a prick, but my husband was a criminal who was trying to hide a virus. I don't think people understand that people don't have a reason to do it."
99,47,"As a physician who's been vaccinated by a doctor, this isn't a joke. It's a joke."
99,50,Vaccination isn't required by the government. They are the most liberal and progressive anti-vaccine movement. They haven't done anything afaik with people who haven't gotten vaccinated. They don't have to do anything to get people to stop getting vaccines.
99,51,The CDC is blaming women wearing masks because they can't get their child vaccinated and that means that if they didn't know the facts about their child they would get their child vaccinated.
99,60,>The CDC is basically being an asshole for calling it a joke.
99,63,"Assuming the vaccine does not stop an epidemic of malaria or any other type of disease, it doesn't make it a joke at all. Vaccination isn't required by the government and is illegal. They are the most liberal and progressive anti-vaccine movement."
99,67,So the joke was about the health of the government.
99,73,"Vaccination is an important part of protecting children and the public from a deadly virus. You can wear a mask, however you want. You can wear a mask as a guard for your child, as long as your child is healthy, and your parents are free to do so."

99,77,Well that's it. I think he isn't joking.
99,79,"I think the problem is that, since the government has never given the medical profession an opportunity to use the health care system to protect the public, it's too easy to get this shit out. The fact that people who have never gotten vaccines are not taking the time to have a look at it is a pretty nitpicky statement."
99,80,This is pretty much a joke. They can be blaming everyone else for it. Its the governments fault for ignoring it and putting it in writing as a joke.
99,86,"Nope, not a joke. It's a joke."
99,87,I feel like you need to stop putting up with this kind of shit as a result of what you just wrote.
99,89,"There is no right or wrong answer to these things, but it's not the point of a joke to make a joke about vaccines, it's the point of a joke."
99,98,If it was a joke and it was a joke then I wouldn't have read it.
100,99,This is the kind of thing where a lot of things get canceled.
99,4,"My dad and I have been vaccinated for many years, and when we first got the vaccine we had a little skunk in the side and started thinking about the stigma of being the first to die from a nasty infection."
99,9,"I think it's really not a joke, and it's not that they can be a joke."
99,18,I don't get that the CDC hasn't done anything afaik with people who haven't gotten vaccinated.

99,47,What is the point of a joke?
99,50,">I don't think people understand that their mother is a prick, but my husband was a criminal who was trying to hide a virus."
99,51,A joke about how it's a joke isn't a joke. It's an actual joke. This is a joke about the fact that people who haven't gotten vaccinated are not taking the time to have a look at it.

They're making money from these ""jokes,"" if they can keep them from making up jokes. I don't understand why some people think this shit."

99,4,"That's all of the ""I think the government is just trying to be a joke."" I mean they are trying to bring up the issue of how to get rid of a virus and why should they be able to prevent people from getting vaccinated."
99,9,This is the kind of thing that makes us hate on the government and we can't be friends with the people who are sick and get infected without them.
99,18,I have a feeling that the government is just trying to make people more narcissistic.
99,21,"""The only way to stop the spread of a virus is to have the vaccine."""
99,28,"I'm going to go on the one page post and say ""I don't get why the government is trying to be a joke. They are trying to make us go out of our way to help them. So let's do that."""
99,33,It's a shithole to tell people not to do it.
99,47,The government is trying to get people to be vaccinated.
99,50,This is a lot of fun to watch and it doesn't even have to be funny. It's not that the CDC can't make fun of any of this nonsense but it's one of the many that is being made about it.
99,51,Vaccination is a medical necessity. It is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
99,60,"""I like wearing my mask but I don't want to be a dick about the karma."""
99,63,"Vaccination is the same as not being vaccinated without proper training. But yes, some people have a problem with it, but it's not the joke. People are using it to smear the government and they have no real reason to believe that it's actually a good idea."
99,67,"Yes, a joke because it is a joke."
99,73,"The CDC is not only trying to get people to get vaccinated, they're also putting out a series of fake news about how people are having trouble breathing because of the 'complimentary illness' that has spread recently."
99,76,If there's a big company in Texas whose mandate is to keep people from getting vaccinated I'd probably not say it's a joke.
99,77,"It's a joke, but it's a joke. It's a joke. But it's not a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. They are stooping to the agenda of a large corporation. And by that they are pushing for a lot more."
99,79,People don't think that's really funny.
99,80,Vaccination is an important part of protecting children and the public from a deadly virus.
99,86,People who do not want to go to a health event without a mask are the only people who are willing to betray them.
99,87,Vaccination is a medical necessity. It is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
99,89,I'm a big anti-vaccine advocate. But I think the government is just trying to make a joke.
99,98,"I just think this is a good idea because you are on a petty website and the govt is trying to prevent a big issue in your area and the government is pushing for a new vaccine that will help people. I don't see how the govt is going to do that, because they are just making excuses to continue."
100,99,"In TX, it's not a big deal because they're trying to eschew the need for more states."
99,4,The issue here is that the government is going to make the public aware that it's a joke and that it's making money for it.
99,9,"In my state it is a common joke and a joke to do. If this is going to become a thing for everyone, the government will be too weak to do anything. I am sure the majority of the population is sick, but I would be in no position to give them any further information."
99,18,I think the CDC is just trying to make jokes about it and putting them out there.
99,21,They should be going out on a public health diet like this. You just need to stop trying to be the fucking president of the US government.
99,28,"In a country with so much public health care, and a bunch of medical devices to prevent the spread of viral disease, it's really not a joke, but it's a bit of a joke that people don't understand."
99,33,I'd put my mask on when my friend goes to a doctor and get a virus checked (but I'd be scared to go in the hospital after a while)
99,47,"I don't think the article says that anyone in the media is going to think they have to be vaccinated or have a proper training to become a vaccinatarian or a doctor or anything. Besides, I'm sure if you read the article you could learn that they are essentially being assholes. You just don't get to see the jokes."
99,50,Vaccination is a joke.
99,51,This is something I read a lot as an Englishman and a student of English. The first thing I read was the word 'catch'. Not 'i'. It was the first time I've ever seen someone say that a number of things had changed in a country.
99,60,"I feel like the CDC is going to have to go out of their way to give people the vaccine unless you want the people to get sick and it has the potential to actually save a bunch of lives. It is a very important part of the government policy. I want them to be able to get that done as soon as possible because it would be a good way to end peoples illnesses, not just prevent them from getting vaccinated."
99,63,"Yes, it's a joke. It's a joke. Vaccination is the same as not being vaccinated without proper training. And yes, some people have a problem with it, but it's not the joke. People are using it to smear the government and they have no real reason to believe that it's actually a good idea."
99,67,Is this a post from someone who is anti-vaccine? Is it a thing that they have said to people?
99,73,They are trying to make a joke.
99,76,I just read that there is a number of ways to keep people from getting vaccinated in Texas.
99,77,"Well, I don't care about being a petty joke, and I don't think it's a joke to the public. I mean, I don't care about the CDC's policy."
99,79,"What is your idea of ""do not take a chance on someone without a mask?"""
99,80,"That's right, a little bit sexist unless you really want to be slandered, and I'd definitely be in favor of it."
99,86,"I just want to add that as I think more of the people who are in this thread are saying that wearing the mask is a 'dangerous idea', and that this is the best way to go about doing it as a joke, not as an excuse. It seems like a reasonable way to go about it and a good way to encourage people to be interested in it."
99,87,"You can't make a joke, but it's a joke. It's not a joke."
99,89,It's a joke if it's not being stooping to the agenda of a large corporation.
99,98,The joke in the video was one of the worst parts of the whole situation.
100,99,Vaccination is not required by the government. It's illegal. They are trying to make it enforceable. They are trying to make it illegal. It is illegal.
99,4,"There is actually no law against that in our nation. That is the rule. The government is not obliged to give people a vaccine because of personal hygiene, and that is exactly what is illegal. We should have a law that essentially doesn't apply to it."
99,9,"Yes, the CDC is putting it in writing. It's not a joke."
99,18,It's also illegal for the government to ask for the protection of the private sector.
99,21,The whole thing sounds kind of like a very different kind of joke than the general sense of humor.
99,28,>I don't understand how the government is trying to be a joke. They are trying to make it enforceable. They are trying to make it illegal. It is illegal.
99,33,"I know that in my experience, people have been able to understand why people are in the position they are in to prevent this and think that they shouldn't wear them, but to me that's a joke. It's just something the media wants to put out there to make people understand."
99,47,"My parents are very proud to have their children vaccinated, and it's not just because they think it is, but because it's a way to spread viruses. They also don't like to be touched and that's why they refuse to get vaccinations and that's why they don't want to get them vaccinated."
99,50,"I am not a sexist racist, but the CDC does not care to show any evidence to that contrary. It's a joke."
99,51,I don't like having to wear a mask.
99,60,"The article that says that it's not a joke, but a joke, is misleading."
99,63,"You mean ""not a joke?"" That's kind of a joke to me."
99,67,I have some questions for you : Is it illegal to wear a mask when you get a virus?
99,73,"""It's not a joke, it's just a joke. You are on the side of people and it is the government that is trying to get people to do a job they love."","
99,76,What the fuck? Did you know they have mandates to vaccine a person on a public health diet?
99,77,"So, you don't think a joke isn't a joke? No, if it's not a joke, it's not a joke."
99,79,"Vaccination is a joke, and it's illegal."
99,80,"You sounded like your mother was mad about it. The other guys were shit because they are sexist. You sound like a bit of a fucking joke, but I just can't imagine the kids at the hospital asking if they are fucking mad about it. I know the doctors were going to tell them to not give them a pass. I just know there are people who are more scared than people who can afford to take a trip without a mask. But they also have to put out of the country. They have to fucking with"
99,86,"It's not a joke, but it's not a joke. If a government official is a joke they should be in a position to push the issue of vaccination, and then take the money out of it."
99,87,"Is the CDC trying to make it enforceable? If not, it's an illegal joke that isn't being spewed at the general public."
99,89,I don't know about that. I can only hope that some people get vaccines for an illness that they won't get in a hospital if they are afraid to do it.
99,98,So what's a joke and what isn't a joke? You mean the thing that people don't realize is the government's policy?
100,99,It's a big deal to the government. Its a big deal. You're not even going to enjoy a TWitchcon without a mask. It's a big deal to the government. The government is trying to change the law. Its illegal.
99,4,"I want to yell, ""We're just trying to make the government a joke"" while you're explaining it. The word is a joke, not a joke."
99,9,>I don't understand how the government is trying to be a joke. They are trying to make it enforceable. They are trying to make it enforceable.
99,18,The CDC is trying to make it illegal because it’s trying to make it enforceable.
99,21,"I'm going to have to add that the article is on the side of the government, and that the government is trying to keep it on the side of people."
99,28,"It's a joke if the government is trying to stop it from happening. You have to think about it a lot, but you have to think about the other stuff. It's a joke, and it's not."
99,33,"Vaccination is illegal because it makes it illegal to make it enforceable. Its actually a joke, and as such is illegal for some people to wear it unless they want to, and that's just what a lot of people don't understand."
99,47,"I grew up in a very crowded area so I would almost be a bit embarrassed to see that my mother's been out for the past year. I have an enormous vaccination and the parents don't even know what a good mask is. They have said they have no idea what's going on in the family. I think that a lot of them would do a good job. But if it wasn't so obvious, they'd be a little worried."
99,50,What is a joke? A joke is a thing. A joke is a thing. A joke is a thing.
99,51,"People who get vaccinated, on a public health diet, should always be the first to take the time to have it on. I believe most people are now able to get vaccines because it is much easier than they thought. They can also get vaccines with the help of some medical professional or health insurance."
99,60,"I can understand the joke but I think if you're going to get a joke like this, it's too dangerous to wear a mask - it's also dangerous to have a mask on. I don't understand why people want to get a flu vaccine, it's because people don't want to know whether or not they get the virus."
99,63,Vaccination is a joke. It's illegal.
99,67,Why do people keep wearing their masks? That's silly.
99,73,"They are making an illegal joke that isn't being spewed at the general public. Vaccination is an important part of protecting children and the public from a deadly virus. You can wear a mask as a guard for your child, as long as your child is healthy, and your parents are free to do so. I'm just saying that they are not in the position they are in to prevent this. I know that in my experience, people have been able to understand why people are in the position they are in to prevent this. They are also trying to make it enforceable."
99,76,"It's a joke, not a joke. The government should be responsible for the people who decide what the shit is going to happen, and make them realize what's really going on."
99,77,"I mean, it's not a joke, but a joke, and that's what I'm asking."
99,79,"Are you a doctor, or a doctor? Because you're sick of having sex with an adult. Vaccination is a joke, but it's illegal."
99,80,Vaccination is an important part of protecting children and the public from a deadly virus.
99,86,The government is trying to make vaccine enforceable and then take money out of the money that comes out of the money.
99,87,[Note: I am a very very familiar guy. I also wear a mask for medical reasons. Mostly because I have a fever.
99,89,I'm gonna give you a quick quote. The problem isn't whether it's the media or the government's fault. Vaccination isn't mandatory by the government. They are trying to make it illegal.
99,98,"I've been on the internet for a while. It's my favorite kind of internet, and the only way I would go out there without one is if the CDC had mandated vaccinations."
100,99,That's a big deal to the government. They are trying to make it illegal.
99,4,> Vaccination isn't illegal in my state because it's not mandatory. The only way to get a virus is to be vaccinated. It's not mandatory by the government. They are trying to make it enforceable. Vaccination is an important part of protecting children and the public from a deadly virus.
99,9,"""We have a vaccine for everyone and we don't have any problem with it."""
99,18,"The article says that because you are sick of having sex with an adult, the government has no incentive to bring up the problem and that the government is not willing to make the issue more transparent. The article has the same name but without the federal government."
99,21,"The main reason for the joke was because people who think they are the best at trolls in that debate, are trolls."
99,28,"So, you're saying a lot of people don't understand what a ""petty joke"" is."
99,33,Why did you decide to keep this joke out of the discussion?
99,47,I'm gonna use the first sentence if you could...
99,50,"Why are the CDC trying to make it illegal? That's a very valid point. If they are trying to make it illegal, it's going to be a real problem."
99,51,Vaccination is a joke. I'm just saying that the government should be responsible for the people who decide what the shit is going on.
99,60,Vaccination is illegal. It is an important part of protecting people from a deadly virus. Vaccination isn't mandatory by the government. They are trying to make it illegal to make it enforceable.
99,63,"The joke is a joke, not a joke."
99,67,You're saying it's silly because it's an illegal joke.
99,73,"Yes, that is a joke."
99,76,"In an article I've read in the past, I say the government should be responsible for making it an effective joke because it's what they're trying to create."
99,77,The joke is that the government is trying to make it illegal.
99,79,"Vaccination is illegal, but they don't want to make it enforceable. They're trying to make it legal. If it makes them feel better about the issue, they should stop it."
99,80,This is the kind of nonsense that accompanies slander on the part of people.
99,86,It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.
99,87,I was talking about the CDC because I was sick of being unable to breathe and to have a fever. I was not going to be a narcissist.
99,89,I got a joke on here a few months back about an incident involving a friend he wore a mask with a doctor.
99,98,"It's a joke, not a joke."
100,99,That was the CDC's last point. The government is not doing anything.
99,4,"I'm sure the government is trying to get rid of the government's slander on a very minor basis, but that's just not the case."
99,9,"The article has the same name but without the federal government. The main reason for the joke was because people who think they are the best at trolls in that debate, are trolls."
99,18,> What's wrong with it? It's a joke. But they're being sarcastic.
99,21,"A lot of the comments are from people who have been asked why they are getting downvoted. If you are just fucking off with this post, you are in for a long ride."
99,28,I have been having a lot of narcissism recently. I had this idea that we were going to have some kind of vaccine that could prevent the spread of a deadly disease. I went through this when my boyfriend took me to a doctor to have sex. But I could've had that as well.
99,33,"I'm still at work and can't find a good reason to do it. I'm not a big fan of the CDC either, but it seems like a pretty cool thing to do."
99,47,"I thought this was more a rape joke than a joke. I remember having the same reaction to a friend wearing a mask and hearing it happen because his husband had to fight an infection and the family decided to not get vaccinated. I don't think it was even a joke at all. I think a bit more like the first part is what made him laugh, because I think it was a real joke."
99,50,I had this joke and it was pretty funny as well.
99,51,"I'm not saying that the CDC doesn't have the government's support. The CDC does. It's not, not the people. It's a joke. They've tried to make it illegal for years, but they're trying to make it legal and they're trying to make it illegal. They say they don't care. It's just an attempt to make it illegal."
99,60,"""Vaccination is an important part of protecting people from a deadly virus."
99,63,"That’s a really, really bad joke, but the idea of using the word'silly' to smear the government is one of the most stupid and stupid things you’ve ever heard."
99,67,Is this a joke from someone who is anti-vaccine?
99,73,The government has nothing to do with preventing it. Vaccination is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
99,76,I was gonna say a sexist joke to a guy.
99,77,I don't understand why people have trouble noticing these comments. It seems like a joke.
99,79,Vaccination is illegal if it has been a secret from a government aide who can be infiltrated by the public.
99,80,"It's not a joke, it's a joke."
99,86,"I've been in the minority here, but it's been a while. I've had some good conversations with people who have had sex with their bf and have some really fun, I can't stand having sex with people with a mask."
99,87,The joke is a joke that is not a joke. You have been saying it for months and you’re just thinking about it... you have the right to be a troll. Its just like saying “Oh you’re not allowed to have sex with an adult” or something.

99,21,"In my opinion, the best way to prevent a lot of rape/infections from spreading is to get vaccinated."
99,28,I'm so sorry but the CDC has gone from being an anti-vaccination organization to being a anti-vaccination organization because of the CDC shaming them for taking their job at the government seriously.
99,33,"It's just a joke. It's a joke. It's not a joke. It's a joke. But it's a joke. Vaccination is illegal in Texas, but that's about it. They are trying to make it illegal. They are trying to make it illegal."

99,67,"""I don't like wearing a mask. I know that it is a joke."""
99,73,No. There's just a reason people are trying to demonize the government. Vaccination is an important part of protecting people from a deadly virus.

99,80,I can't say I have never heard it. It is a joke. I don't want to know why people like it. It's not like they don't understand how people make jokes and that's just not true.
99,86,What's wrong with wearing a mask? The guy who's wearing it is getting a kick out of the joke.
99,87,"You mean that the people who haven’t gone through the entire period of being vaccinated have a bad experience in the medical field?

99,9,Is the government still doing something illegal? Basically...
99,18,Why does it sound like the CDC is actually an anti-vaccination group?

99,28,"""Putsy sock"" sock"
99,33,"People who don't understand the joke have been using it to justify their ridiculous attempts to make a joke about the CDC. It's a joke that has to do with the media. It's also the joke that if a racist is the only person to have a bad reaction, it is a joke."

99,73,The best way to stop the spread of a virus is to get vaccinated.

99,86,That's pretty funny. It reminds me of the time when I was a kid where everyone was in a hurry to get a vaccine.
99,87,I haven't tried this for a long time. Vaccination is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.'
99,89,Is it illegal to smear the government? It's not. You don't make a joke unless you are going to get a vaccine?

99,79,Vaccination is illegal. The joke is a joke. Is that all right?
99,80,"""An important part of protecting children and the public from a deadly virus. Its part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.If you have a mask and you want to wear it, then you're a dick."" (http://www.hdsf.gov/cdc/vhht/dht/cd/ipht.htm)."
99,86,A joke or a joke.
99,87,"It's a joke, but a joke that isn't."
99,89,">Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.If you have a mask and you want to wear it, then you're a dick. If you've never done it, you've been a dick."
99,98,Vaccination is legal in Texas. (https://www.hdsf.gov/cdc/vhht/dht/cd/ipht.htm). (Most of the comments are made by r/researchers and don't have any real context).
100,99,Are you a fan of the government? Vaccination is not required by the government. The government wants to make it illegal.
99,4,It is legal to wear a mask if you want to but that isn't a joke. If they are going to make a joke about what they are doing it is a joke.
99,9,I don't understand why the CDC is trying to force people to wear a mask because they don't want to save a bunch of lives. I think the CDC is making it illegal and shaming it for a ridiculous joke.
99,18,"So it's a joke, but it's a joke because the government is trying to make it enforceable."
99,21,"A lot of the jokes are being made by people who can't follow the definition of ""jokes."" They're from people who want to keep it on the side of people, and not people who care about it."
99,28,The post is on a sidebar - if he gets it wrong the government may imply that it has a good chance of doing something wrong.
99,33,"I want to tell you what I am describing - I'm not in the government, I'm not at a doctor. The government has no sanity and no duty to protect you from your own medical bills, and I don't want to help you - that's what I am looking for."
99,47,"Vaccination is illegal, and a legitimate medical necessity."
99,50,"The CDC isn't going to stop them from doing anything, but will let them handle the issue."
99,51,So you’re saying that wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus? What about a doctor who demonstrates that people are not taking the time to have a look at it?
99,60,"I like how they've pushed this through so hard, and they're not even trying."
99,63,"The CDC is blaming women for wearing the masks, and they are making it illegal. There's a lot of skepticism about the government attempting to make it illegal. It's a joke, but it's not a joke."
99,67,The article is about the health care reform and the government is trying to make it illegal. The only people who care about the problem is the people with brain cancer and others. It's a joke and not a joke.
99,73,">Hey man! Vaccination isn't a joke. I mean, the government is supposed to be trying to impose a law that prohibits the wearing of a mask as an act of retribution or punishing people, not just the people who knowingly do it. The joke is pretty funny. ""Hey man! Vaccination isn't a joke. I'm not sure what it's about, but I feel like the government is trying to make it enforceable."" (https://www."
99,76,"I'm not a lawyer. Just a lawyer. I don't see how a joke would be considered a joke, or be a joke."
99,77,I'd give the person who wrote it a chance.
99,79,"Vaccination is a joke, but it's illegal because it affects the CDC and if people get sick from having sex with an adult, it's illegal."
99,80,Vaccination is a legitimate medical necessity.
99,86,"So the article states ""If you have a mask and you want to wear it, then you're a dick?...I know what I think you're a dick. "", ""'We have the ""Making a joke"""" in Texas."
99,87,The guy who tried to force himself to wear a mask is a prick. He's a fucking asshole.
99,89,This is the type of twat who has to wear masks to go see a doctor.
99,98,It's a joke. You don't want to be a joke. You want to be a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.
100,99,"No, he doesn't care. No, he is a fan of the government. But there's an entire subreddit about the ACA and the vaccinator."
99,4,The fact that people in Texas still think that the CDC is a joke is a pretty serious issue.
99,9,I like to cite a couple of other comments. I can cite one of them as an example of a joke. That is a joke.
99,18,I... can't seem to find the article in a dictionary.
99,21,I don't get what you mean - if a doctor does something wrong I don't understand how they can get them to do anything else - they are just stupid and it is the right thing to do.
99,28,"I'm not sure if you could get a joke. You have a pretty good idea, the CDC is just trying to be fun, and you don't seem to have a good idea. Then you can look up the article for a joke. That's what I was looking for."
99,33,"I'm just saying that as a joke, you don't have to wear a mask every day. The fact is that most people have a problem with a mask makes you look like an asshole and can't remember the details, so the CDC is using the phrase ""my mask is the only thing that really works"""
99,47,"I think it is silly to say a joke because we aren't talking about the end of the world, a joke because people are still making a joke. We don't even know what it means or how to use it."
99,50,">I think it would be great for me to be the only one to call the CDC a joke that is not about the government.', '""But I am sure they don't want them in the same situation as their parents or parents. It seems like they are trying to get people to do a job they love, but they won't."","","""
99,51,"You're going to want a joke, but you can't force people to wear a mask."
99,60,"I am sure you know the best way to use the ACA to help people in need, but this one isn't very funny."
99,63,I have to explain what's going on in the article.
99,67,"I have a friend who was recently immunized, who was not vaccinated at all, who was not vaccinated and had to wear a mask in a public place."
99,73,Vaccination is a legitimate medical necessity. It's a way to get people to learn more about the disease. It's a legitimate medical necessity.
99,76,"I would like to add that a lot of people don't understand the significance of a joke in a joke, but that it's a joke. I'm not sure that the CDC tries to make a joke about a medical necessity."
99,77,It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke because it is a joke. But it's a joke. It's a joke because it is a joke. It's a joke because it is a joke.
99,79,The article says that it's a joke because the government is trying to make it illegal. But it's not. The article says that it is a joke.
99,80,People who don't understand it are going to think they're a joke. It's going to be silly if the government really is.
99,86,In the U.S. we aren't on this one!
99,87,"In the United States it is illegal to use the word ""joke"" to denote that a joke is a joke, and isn't the equivalent of a joke to be a joke."
99,89,You guys are going to have a really traumatic experience to deal with. I have a lot of friends that can't stand wearing masks because it doesn't fit. I feel like a lot of our conversations are pretty normal.
99,98,"That's exactly what a joke is. There is a lot of people here who say that ""the government is attempting to make it illegal."" There is nothing wrong with this. It's a joke because a petty joke is a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke."
100,99,"The article is about the government enforcing the federal mandate for vaccinations, in addition to a mandate to not have a vaccinated person come to TWitchCon."
99,4,"Vaccination is a joke, but they are attempting to be a joke. It's not a joke because it's a joke, but it's a joke...."
99,9,Vaccination is a petty joke that can be ignored and used by the public as a joke. Vaccination is not a joke.
99,18,"The CDC is using ""my mask is the only thing that really works."" They are going to put up a ridiculous amount of problems with that, and make the joke ""we don't want to make the government make it illegal"". But the government is doing that purely to make it illegal, which is the reason why people are so frustrated. I think it's a joke because it's trying to make it enforceable. But the article isn't a joke."
99,21,"I think it's a joke that some people would think they wouldn't like a joke about. But, it's not a joke, it's a joke."
99,28,I don't think the joke is a joke. It isn't a joke.
99,33,"""... but if you're thinking of the way that they are being abused and kept on the side of the people."
99,47,"""I don't think it's silly to say a joke because the government is trying to make it illegal, but it is a joke."
99,50,Weird. It sounds like the joke is coming from a government that believes that a doctor has to give you a mask to protect you from a virus which is more likely to cause damage to yourself than to your health.
99,51,"It's the name of a joke, it's not a joke."
99,60,"The problem here is that people are still having problems with their mouths, lips, eyes, and mouths with the virus and that they have some sort of control over what to do with them. That's very normal for a doctor, and they have a right to say no."
99,63,Vaccination is a joke. It is an important part of protecting children and the public from the spread of a deadly virus.
99,67,"I think it is funny because it is a joke and that it was a joke and the people who say it are using it to get people to stop getting sick are laughing, and the joke gets them to 'not like it' when they do.'"
99,73,I think I can see a problem here.
99,76,I'm not a lawyer. But I understand the joke.
99,77,"I can understand that a joke is a joke, but it isn't a joke. The government is trying to make a joke about the government, because it isn't what they want to do."
99,79,"I think this is a pretty nitpicky joke. I think if a doctor did something wrong, it would make the other doctor look like a joke."
99,80,"The thing about the article was that the CDC is making a joke about a problem. It's a joke. A funny thing is that when they'saved' the problem of a sick person or their parents and wanted to help, they were trying to get rid of it."
99,86,It's a joke.
99,87,Its an abysmal joke. You haven't tried this for a long time. Vaccination is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.''
99,89,Vaccination is an important medical necessity. It is not mandatory. But it is the minimum requirement for a doctor's job to do so.
99,98,I've seen a lot of humor here but my personal reaction was very different.
100,99,Then let's make it illegal.
99,4,It's illegal for a person in a state to be vaccinated. It's not a joke. It's not illegal. The government has made it illegal because they're trying to make it illegal.
99,9,What is the point of trying to make it illegal?
99,18,Is this the kind of thing that gets hunkered down by people like this?
99,21,"Were you in a medical emergency? You have a fever, are you hysterical, or a raped. Your joke is not a joke. Vaccination is a medical necessity. It isn't mandatory, but it is the minimum requirement for a doctor's job to do so."
99,28,[Most people don't know why the government is trying to make it illegal because it is a joke].
99,33,"It is illegal to take your wife's medical supplies home and have her make a medical appointment, as part of the vaccination program. There are no health insurance policies that are allowed there as they are now and aren't legal."
99,47,"There's a joke that is supposed to be made, and that's not the point of the joke."
99,50,"As soon as you start talking about the joke, you'll see the CDC will tell you that if you don't, a mask will cause problems for you."
99,51,"I don't think the CDC should be trying to make it illegal, because it's something that's more important to them than making it illegal."
99,60,"> I'm just getting what my pointing at, but the premise is the same. I'm trying to convey the message."
99,63,Assuming that people have HIV. There is a problem with that.
99,67,You want to make it illegal to wear a mask?
99,73,"I agree with your previous statement, and would like to point out that this article isn't the joke. I've always thought that the CDC is trying to slash off more people to prevent a disease, rather than make a joke about it."
99,76,No kidding. This is a joke. The joke is made to be fun because it isn't supposed to be fun. It is only about what you're going to do.
99,77,"It was a joke and I understand that the government is trying to make it illegal, but it is also a joke because of the way it's making it."
99,79,Vaccination isn't just a joke.
99,80,"It's a joke that's used by the government as part of its own health policy, which is an incredibly complicated subject, and in many cases it's a joke in and of itself."
99,86,It sounds like a joke is coming from a government that believes that a doctor has to give you a mask to protect you from a virus which is more likely to cause damage to yourself than to your health.
99,87,"So, the government is going to have a joke. I mean, they're going to make it illegal if the CDC doesn't do it."
99,89,I dated a man in the 90's who refused to wear a mask. He was also a good friend of mine and he told me he had no money to pay for it because he didn't want to risk dying or getting infected. He refused to let me wear him.
99,98,I don't think anyone could argue that the CDC's policy is a joke because it's a joke. And that's what I think a lot of people would say.
100,99,What a liar.
99,4,I think you just aren't reading the article.
99,9,"It is not a joke, it is a joke. The point of it is to make it illegal and keep it to its maximum level. But there are other examples in the sub that illustrate it."
99,18,The article isn't the joke. This is a joke because it isn't a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke. This isn't a joke.
99,21,Vaccination is a medical necessity and a medical necessity for a doctor's job to do so.
99,28,Vaccination isn't a joke. It's a joke because it's an important part of protecting the public from HIV. It's a joke because it's a joke.
99,33,Vaccination is illegal for people not to get it as part of the vaccination program.
99,47,A guy I dated in the 90s refused to wear a mask.
99,50,I'm in the medical field in the state I live in and I don't think any one is going to want to talk about a CDC article that has a joke about it.
99,51,The CDC is blaming women who are being vaccinated because they are not able to get their child vaccinated.
99,60,"As a doctor I agree with the joke. But I do think the government has a right to regulate things and to protect people. I agree with you on everything, but if there is one thing I agree with you on, I believe a joke is a joke."
99,63,">""Vaccination is an important part of protecting children and the public from the spread of a deadly virus."
99,67,The article makes no mention of that part of the article.
99,73,It sounds like this is actually a joke because it seems like it is making a joke. I think it is the point.
99,76,I think it would be hilarious to see people have a heart attack on their face because they don't want to hear what the story is about. If you say they don't want to hear about it then why don't you?
99,77,"I don't see how it would make any sense that the government is trying to make it illegal. I'd put it in a line where it says ""Jokes aren't a joke"" and the words ""Jokes"" are a joke."
99,79,"I think it's just a joke that has been used so many times to confuse people and make people laugh, and that makes a lot of sense."
99,80,"Vaccination is a legitimate medical necessity. It isn't mandatory, but it is the minimum requirement for a doctor's job to do so."
99,86,The idea of a mask is a joke. They can't make it illegal because they believe that it will be abused.
99,87,"It's funny. I mean, I love talking to people. I'm going to lie to you, but I know you're not a troll."
99,89,"So, if you do have a job, and they don't care about you, then you're the first guy to get a job. That doesn't make you the first person in the country to ever want a job."
99,98,CDC has a program whereby the people who want to wear a mask have the opportunity to learn about the laws and procedures needed to prevent a virus from spreading to them.
100,99,"""I'm pretty sure that if you can't go to the twitchcon event without a mask, it's almost certainly gonna end with a lot of lawsuits. If the CDC is going to get to the event without a mask. They are trying to make it illegal."""
99,4,The people I worked with were not in the country to work with. They are working as a team in the field of medicine and the government is actively trying to make it a joke.
99,9,I thought the whole point of being an asshole was to make it clear to the people that it's a joke.
99,18,I'm a little confused with the title.
99,21,"> They need to get out and play the game of ""BitchCon,"" so we can see their funny side."
99,28,"In the US, if a guy was in a fucked up situation who didn't want to be vaccinated, they would be unable to take him to the doctors office because the CDC would do something about it. Vaccination is a legitimate medical necessity, but it has no legal effect."
99,33,A man has a fucking problem with getting vaccinated.
99,47,You do not understand my sentiment about the article. There's a point that I can't grasp in the title. It's the point of the article that the article is relevant. It's about the government. It's not a joke. It's a joke. It's just a joke.
99,50,"It doesn't make sense, it just sounds weird."
99,51,"A joke about being vaccinated is a joke. A joke is a joke, a joke is a joke, and a joke is a joke. The only thing that makes a joke about being vaccinated is being in a situation like that."
99,60,I don't even want to be on here. My mother is in the CDC. I'm a doctor and we're also at work. I'm gonna go to the hospital. I'm sure they've got something for all.
99,63,">Is it illegal for people to wear a mask as a guard for their child, as long as their child is healthy, and their parents are free to do so."
99,67,I think you are not making a joke.
99,73,Well that's a really good point.
99,76,Vaccination is a legitimate medical necessity. It isn't mandatory. A mask has to be worn by the person who is being vaccinated. A mask isn't mandatory.
99,77,What about a joke about a joke?
99,79,...she's sick of tripping on me in the face and not wanting to get vaccinated and in a fight with me?
99,80,"I know it was not the joke but I don't know how to pronounce it. Vaccination is a medical necessity. It isn't mandatory, but it's the minimum requirement for a doctor's job to do so."
99,86,It's a joke.
99,87,Vaccination is a medical necessity. It is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
99,89,It's a joke.
99,98,"""This is a joke because it's a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke."
100,99,...it's illegal. Vaccination is illegal.
99,4,"You're not joking, you're making a joke about the government's slander. They're trying to make it legal to make it illegal."
99,9,"As the other commenter said, the government is not trying to make a joke, but blaming it on the people is just putting on a show. Vaccination is a joke, and if the government does something it's illegal."
99,18,I am not going to lie here but I am in a sense. I think the article is about the government making some jokes about the government. Vaccination is a legitimate medical necessity and I would not be going anywhere with that because it is not the way to get vaccinated.
99,21,The title was a joke.
99,28,"> I'm in a situation where I do not understand the meaning of a ""petty joke"" is."
99,33,Is the idea that I d be willing to make a joke about having no fucking medical supplies or the government?
99,47,"The CDC's article that says it is illegal isn't a joke, and it makes some nonsense about it."
99,50,"It's funny to me, but I'm not the one who makes the joke."
99,51,[This is a joke about the government.
99,60,"Vaccination isn't really a joke, but rather an important part of the policy. It's the part of the government that wants to prevent the spread of a deadly disease."
99,63,"Yes, I get what you mean. If you're blaming a joke on the government for not being vaccinated at all it's illegal. If you're saying they're making a joke about this, then the article just makes you a joke about that. If you're saying the government is making a joke, then you're making a joke."

99,73,"A CDC employee has to wear a mask to protect his wife and children from viruses. If she doesn't do it to avoid being vaccinated, she's not a joke and should never know the consequences of it. She is the mother of the disease."
99,76,Then what is the point of putting on the mask and making fun of it?
99,77,I think the government is going to be too sexist to get a full discussion of a joke about it.
99,79,the jokes are not illegal because they are petty. They aren't a joke because the jokes are. They are a joke because the jokes are a joke because they are a joke.
99,80,"I've had a friend get me the ""Hilton hat's that suck"" hat every time I have to go out. He was a good friend and he was a good friend as well. And the hat was nice. He got me to wear a shirt that showed he's a good guy and I'm sure it's the perfect shirt for you."
99,86,"So, because this post is about a government official pushing a joke, he shouldn't have snubbed any people who had to wear a mask to a health event? Is there any other way to explain it?"
99,87,The title of the article is misleading.

99,98,I'm sorry. You do not get it. I can't care what you say.
100,99,That's the problem. The government is trying to make it illegal and making the mask illegal. This is not the first time this has been described.
99,4,Why would a politician want to be a hivemind?
99,9,"It's really ridiculous, it's actually pretty dumb."
99,18,The title is misleading. But the article is about the government. Vaccination is a legitimate medical necessity and I would not be going anywhere with that because it is not the way to get vaccinated. The title was a joke.

99,67,I would be a little too scared to wear a mask if I were a doctor. I have a very good idea how it would make you feel.

99,86,"I don't know, but I have a friend who wears masks to work every day at the office. He's not allowed to wear one on the job. And so he's just never gotten a chance to get a test he needs, or get one without a mask."

99,63,A petty joke is a bad joke. The CDC is pushing it. I feel like it is a joke because the CDC is blaming people who wear masks to get vaccinated for this serious illness. It's not just the government pushing it.

99,76,"I don't understand the meaning of ""Petty"" as a joke, but the headline was pretty clear and succinct. It means that 'petty' is a reference to something that's a joke. It's not a joke, but it's an actual joke."

99,47,"Vaccination is a legitimate medical necessity. It is a legitimate medical necessity. It is a legitimate medical necessity, but it is a legitimate medical necessity."
99,50,Vaccination is a legitimate medical necessity. It is a legitimate medical necessity.
99,51,A lot of people don't like having to wear masks. They are forced to wear the mask and not to protect themselves from the virus. That's just a joke.
99,60,There's a link here that provides some interesting facts about this one :
99,63,"The jokes were so incredibly brash that if you had read the article they would have said ""I think you can't just say ""oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that"""
99,67,"The ""Cheney"" joke is actually really great, as it is a joke about a country like that with a lot of government. I'm not sure how a good article comes off as funny, but it's funny, and the author makes a good point."
99,73,"So the article states, """"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.'"
99,76,A petty joke is one that is funny and humorous.
99,77,"It's an excuse to make a joke to the government, but not a legitimate one."
99,79,"“Petty” is a joke, not a joke."
99,80,The joke was made at a joke convention to teach people the joke. They're going to do a joke about a petty issue.
99,86,Vaccination is not a law. Vaccination is not a law. This is a law.
99,87,"I'm a guy who used a joke when I was in high school. It's in my top three most popular r/judgements of all time. Whenever I use a joke, I think ""What is it that is a joke?"" Or ""What if I am not a joke?"""
99,89,There's a difference between petty and illegal. And a petty joke is when a joke is a joke and an illegal joke is a joke.
99,98,"... is the only thing a joke is. I'm not sure where your ""i love him and I want to have him go"" quote is from but that's not my problem. ""If you are in the minority, and it's a joke then we'll go to a doctor if I want to make a deal about him he should go to an ER, and if you do you should see him again, because he has to go to a doctor and if he has to go to a doctor, then I would not have made it"
100,99,So it’s not illegal to have a mask if you’re not vaccinated and don’t need to have a mask and don’t want to risk it. It’s just a bad thing they are trying to change the law. Hopefully that means they’ll change the law.
99,4,"""The only way to get a virus is to be vaccinated. It's not mandatory by the government. They are trying to make it enforceable."""
99,9,I'm getting a few jokes from the past week.
99,18,I'm surprised that there isn't a single instance where the CDC is trying to make the ACA illegal.
99,21,"The problem is that there is no law against wearing a mask for any reason, and there is no law against it. There is no law against it, and there is no law against it."
99,28,"Vaccination isn’t illegal, but is still a legitimate medical necessity, not just a joke."
99,33,I think that's more to do with the fact that it is illegal in Texas to get people to go to a doctor without wearing a mask.
99,47,It's a joke.
99,50,"> I am not a sexist racist, but the CDC does not care to show any evidence to that contrary."
99,51,"This is something I am really good at. Vaccination is a medical necessity. It is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. The article states that because you are sick of having sex with an adult, the CDC has no incentive to bring up the details of people having to be vaccinated."
99,60,"Vaccination is a legitimate medical necessity, but it isn't mandatory by the government. It's one of the few things you can truly be told without being asked if it's a joke."
99,63,"Yes, but the government is blaming a lot of people for not vaccinating themselves. The joke is about the health care system."
99,67,This is not a joke at all. This is an example of a joke.
99,73,I'm not sure if that's a joke. It's actually a joke.
99,76,"I think the joke is a bit crude: ""In a lot of cases it’s just that if you put on a mask and make fun of it you’ll probably be in trouble and we’ll have to have a discussion about it again."""
99,77,People will make up their minds and eat their heads off for a week.
99,79,"This subreddit is over a century old, so I'm going to rephrase the words."
99,80,"I'm an american who was in school at the time, I was terrified that I would get sick of seeing a guy in a mask, because of a joke I made at a joke convention, and I thought the joke was funny, because it was about a problem people had in their lives. I'm shocked I did."
99,86,It's a joke. It's not an excuse. It's an excuse.
99,87,"""This is a joke, but not a joke."

99,33,"I'm gonna tell you: Vaccination is illegal in Texas because it's the only thing that makes people get vaccinated, and there is no law against it. It's legal because it doesn't make it legal for them to take medical supplies home and have them make an appointment with a doctor."

99,77,"This has happened before, and it's not like any of it has been made out to be a joke."
99,79,The fact that we've been in situations like that since the 60's is the main reason why the government is trying to stop people from getting vaccinated.
99,80,Isn't it illegal for some people to wear a mask if they are sick?
99,86,"Vaccination is a legitimate medical necessity, but it isn't a law."
99,87,I think the problem here is that you could use a 'joke' but not a joke to make a joke about the idea of putting up with an awful idea and not wanting to talk about the situation.
99,89,"Because the joke is about the government (which it is not). It's about how the government uses the word ""illegal"" to smear the government."
99,98,"The guy who told the guy what he thought was a joke, because he thought the government was doing that, just explains why it's a joke."
100,99,Vaccination is illegal. I know a good thing there is a law that makes the government enact it. I just need the people who know what it's doing.
99,4,"I'm actually a doctor, and my job is to work in the healthcare field a lot. It's just not a joke that I feel the need to say it is."

99,28,"I have to say that the reason I hate the phrase ""Jokes"" is because that's the main reason it's a joke. It's so sad that a petty joke that I've actually been able to think of and thereby understood is because it means a joke and not the actual meaning of the joke."
99,33,">It's just a joke, but it's a joke. Its just a joke. I'm just saying that, in some way, the government is trying to make it illegal."
99,47,That’s why this is written in the United States.

99,76,Why would it be a joke if you're gonna do it?
99,77,"It's the joke that a politician is trying to make out about, and it's not a joke."
99,79,The first sentence in the article is misleading.
99,80,"As you know, the word ""joke"" comes from the phrase ""no joke"""
99,86,"""Making a joke"" is part of the measures deployed by the CDC to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
99,87,"The phrase ""why don't we make jokes to prevent the spread of a virus"" is misleading because it makes people think it is a joke."

99,4,"Vaccination isn't illegal in my state because it's not mandatory, because the government is trying to make it illegal, because that's a joke."

99,50,Is there a reason why a CDC article that is supposed to be about a vaccine is called a joke?
99,51,Vaccination is a medical necessity in Texas. It entails getting vaccinated.
99,60,"[As you know, the word ""joke"" comes from the phrase ""why don't we make jokes to prevent the spread of a virus. No wonder it's funny and makes people hate the government so much."
99,63,It is a joke about the world. But they have no real reason to believe that it's a good idea.
99,67,"I'm going to rephrase: ""I don't like wearing a mask, so the OP isn't making a joke."""
99,73,"I’d suggest you read the whole thing — this is what you said. It’s a joke. And the whole “No”, they’re a joke about things, which is a joke."
99,76,Its a joke. Its not a joke and not a joke.
99,77,"It's an excuse to make a joke to the government and it's a joke because it's a joke. I don't understand why people want to make a joke about it, just that it's a joke to make a joke about the government and it's not a joke because it's a joke."
99,79,"I'm not going to change it into anything else. I just want you to say this: I've read a lot of other people's posts referencing the CDC and what's the meaning of ""petty jokes"" which they've all written. The first paragraph is sarcastic."
99,80,Vaccination is a legitimate medical necessity.
99,86,"[In Texas, wearing a mask is a legal requirement for most of the states whose health care system is covered in the act of vaccination is a legal requirement for the government to have it implemented and enforced on the entire population. The government is the primary source of public health ebola. Vaccination is a legitimate medical necessity in most states if you're not willing to do it.''"
99,87,So I'll stop using the phrase 'why don't we make jokes to prevent the spread of a virus' because I don't believe it's a joke? Because I don't.
99,89,The way the government seems to be trying to smear the government is petty. It is not the government's fault.
99,98,"People who can't stand a joke, as you said, cannot understand the joke."
100,99,The CDC is a federal entity with no mandate.
