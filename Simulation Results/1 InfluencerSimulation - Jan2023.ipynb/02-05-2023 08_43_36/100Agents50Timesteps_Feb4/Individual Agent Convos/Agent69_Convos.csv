91,69,how does the mask make his breath come out of the back of his head
94,69,says the woman that wears the mask to protect herself lmao well dear the gun works the mask doesn t
69,18,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
74,69,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask
84,69,So is a helmet required to go to the doctor?
87,69,i hate that i will eat so many hamburgers from a pack a day
91,69,"This is probably not a good explanation, but this is a great example. I don't think there are more effective ways to stop a disease than a mask. Especially if he is going to resuscitate himself while he's still a bad coach."
94,69,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.says the woman that wears the mask to protect herself lmao well dear the gun works the mask doesn t
69,18,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
74,69,"If you want to get mad at someone that doesn't wear a mask, you have to do something about it. If you don't want to, you should probably get rid of it."
84,69,a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.Oh man you should come to Georgia it s like people here think wearing a mask gives them covid there s so few
87,69,> You can hate me if the state town doesn t have an mandates you can get mad that an event doesn t have an mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask
91,69,A shirt and a pair of pants versus a shirt are a big part of the mandates for the federal government to help stop the spread of a virus.
94,69,I think this is the best answer I've seen from the author of the article.
69,18,You gotta wear a mask. I just want you to wear a mask and make sure you don't get sick while you're traveling to Georgia.
74,69,"That's why the CDC wants to ban all vaccines unless there are mandatory vaccinations pending. I can tell you that there are some that actually will not, but those don't seem to be implemented with a proper policy."
84,69,This is just the kind of thing you can do.
87,69,"""It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. If you don't know anyone that would want to be in a hospital in a medical emergency, you should be able to say ""I don't wear a mask to help spread the virus. If you don't, that's a medical emergency. If you don't want to wear a mask, do not wear it."""
91,69,I've had to go through two titties to see what the article says.
94,69,I'm glad to hear that people don't think we should be indoctrinated in a religion.
69,18,"It's not as simple as: ""Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. How does the mask make his breath come out of the back of his head says the woman that wears the mask to protect herself lmao well dear the gun works the mask doesn't Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
74,69,"> I love the look of a mask and the smell of one TWitchCon and DC’s, because you can’t afford to attend the event. I’ve never seen this type of thing. I’m from Georgia. If a state event has to get to state capitol I’d go to either TwitchCon or DC’s, because you can’t afford to attend the event. I’ve never seen this type of thing."
84,69,I think a lot of the skepticism that comes with the federal government's approach to protecting health care should be put to rest.
87,69,I am gonna say this about twitchcon and masks you can hate me if the state town doesn't have an mandates you can get mad that an event doesn't have any mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask
91,69,AMA is the only real response for the first few days.
94,69,"So I don't think the government should do anything for everyone and everyone's health, or to make it all about me, or to make it about you or me, and then, you know, then, to give them the same information they're used to."
69,18,I think a lot of the skepticism that comes with the federal government's approach to protecting health care should be put to rest.
74,69,"It’s not in the context of the article, it’s the context of a post. It's about a sexist, rapist - racist, and ineffective government that is making people uncomfortable in public."
84,69,Is this a comment to a joke from a GOP senator?
87,69,"I don't understand why you think a mask would be a good idea. It would be one of those things that you're not in the mood to do and if you are in the mood to do that, you need to have it on. I mean, if you really are not going to be able to do that you need to go to a doctor, they should be able to help you do so. That's what they call a medical emergency and you can wear a mask."
91,69,"People aren't just trying to defend it as a problem, they're trying to reclaim it as a problem to be able to do it themselves."
94,69,Vaccination is not mandatory for everyone unless the person is in an advanced stage of a clinical trial. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
69,18,> I'm glad to hear that people don't think we should be indoctrinated in a religion.
74,69,"""Sorry about the confusion. I don't want to say i hate you. I think I don't have a choice."""
84,69,"I don't know if you could come here to explain the difference between a Republican and a Democratic as I have a Democratic wife, and the fact that they have a Democratic wife in the Senate isn't a coincidence, but they do have a Republican wife."
87,69,It's basically an omission that is all but confirmed. But I just don't get it. It's basically an omission that is all but confirmed.
91,69,EPA & NRA have no authority to change the health care system.
94,69,He can go to the doctors and ask them to wear a mask to prevent an infection. There are so many ways of preventing a virus.
69,18,"I don't see a whole lot of context here. It's about a sexist, rapist - racist, and ineffective government that is making people uncomfortable in public."
74,69,The whole thing is that if I had a rebuttal to that sentence it would be:
84,69,I've heard the CDC is one of the largest statewide organizations that is responsible for protecting health care.
87,69,They should be able to help people if needed unless they have a medical emergency. They can wear a mask and just don't do it. It's a really good idea to have a narcissist when you can't actually do that because of your own narcissism.
91,69,"I don't think there's a right answer. But, I agree that people are going to see this film."
94,69,"I'm a doctor, and I wear a mask every day. It's the most effective means of stopping the spread of a virus."
69,18,"That's actually a good one, and I would consider it an example of the same thing."
74,69,Why do you say that the CDC wants to ban vaccines pending?
84,69,"This guy screams ""you're not a republican, you are a democratic Republican!"""
87,69,Isn't the lack of an actual mandate that is part of the idea of putting on a mask part of the measures deployed by the government?
91,69,... and a new source for the entire story.
94,69,"I have never heard the word ""hammer"" before. It's a common language in the US : you don't have to wear a mask to get a vaccine."
69,18,People don't believe it's right to keep them in a mask as a precaution.
74,69,"I'm not saying that this is about TWitchCon or DC, but I think that the President wears a mask to keep the people who were uninfected, and he is being insulted in his attempt to prevent the spread of the virus. It's a good joke, but not a great one."
84,69,Are you going to make an effort to change the law or get into the health care debate in a couple of years?
87,69,You don't see it as an opportunity to help people in a medical emergency and you're not able to get that to be a medical emergency?
91,69,"This isn't a right answer, it's a misunderstanding. I don't think there's a right answer. If they want to get rid of the federal government, I don't think they should."
94,69,"We have a lot of different definitions of the word ""shames to stop the spread of a virus."""
69,18,"The term ""hammer"" is a bit of a stretch but if you think the CDC will ban vaccines because the government has been saying this in the past, then I bet they will."
74,69,I am actually going to look for a mask for a party in NYC in October and I will probably buy one myself.
84,69,I have no idea how this is even possible. I want to talk about vaccines and the other guys are wearing them.
87,69,"I'm a Democrat. Vaccination is a medical necessity. It entails getting vaccinated. Its the way a patient dies, it's the way a patient is vaccinated and not their health."
91,69,You're thinking of the NRA. And don't forget that they are a bunch of terrorists. The NRA is a lot worse than it is.
94,69,>I think this is the best answer I've seen from the author of the article.
69,18,A friend of mine told me about a viral infection that was spreading on his neighbor's apartment in California. He told me that if he was vaccinated he would wear a mask. The CDC told him not to use the mask.
74,69,"A sexist, racist, and ineffective government is a good joke."
84,69,"i've never heard that one, but it is a bit weird that people think that the government should enact legislation to help prevent the spread of a virus"
87,69,"You are right, but the person who is blaming the government for being a sexist, sexist, sexist, and hypocritical person is being a sexist troll."
91,69,"He's trying to get out. Hey Obama, the Obama administration is a horrible person. This is so sad to read. It is so disgusting."
94,69,Isn't that part of the joke? Vaccination is not mandatory. It isn't even necessary. Vaccination is a slang term for what I'm sure a lot of people are not aware of.
69,18,"""I'm glad to hear that people don't think we should be indoctrinated in a religion."""
74,69,"[sorry about the confusion. I don’t want to say i hate you. I think I don’t have a choice."""
84,69,"I'm an American. I can tell you a lot about the CDC and that my husband has his face plastered on every office, but at least he has a lot of information on vaccines."
87,69,So what is the wiki article on?
91,69,The NRA is one of the best and most incredibly successful organizations. They are able to work with a large amount of people in this country and they can fire them.
94,69,"The jokes aren't going to get any wider than the actual jokes in the wiki article, just the actual premise of the article."
69,18,Vaccination is a slang term for what I'm sure a lot of people are not aware of.
74,69,I'm going to tell you about a fucking joke.
84,69,"The article states that the CDC is the primary government agency. The president has a 'no control over healthcare policy'. Its a huge mistake to use this to protect the health of everyone. Its also a very good idea to not keep people in a hospital for a long time, and therefore prevent the spread of a virus. It is not an official policy or official mandate for any person."
87,69,I don't even like being on here.
91,69,Then the NRA will take the name of the person who has been charged with a crime on behalf of the terrorists to court for their actions.
94,69,It's a joke that people say it isn't necessary. It's a joke that people say it isn't necessary.
69,18,"Yes, the term is misleading and doesn't mean anything. I understand why the guy that was trying to make you feel uncomfortable on the internet is trying to sound like a racist, but not sure what his point is."
74,69,As a person in Florida I would say that it's a joke. I just think it's just another joke about the government that's making people uncomfortable.
84,69,"I think the issue here is that the NFL is on the verge of a national sceptic disorder, and a lack of support. It's just not that good. The NFL is a crappy organization, but the way they handle it is the same."
87,69,Vaccination is not an insurance issue. It's a health issue. Well he was being a little bit trite.
91,69,I think the whole point of this is to make it very clear that the NRA is a terrorist organization. Not that it's going to make a statement about their actions but to tell people that they are a terrorist group.
94,69,"As a doctor, I wouldn't wear a mask at all. I'm in the clinic."
69,18,You can't be a racist without the CDC. You cannot be a racist without the CDC. I'm a racist because I am racist because I am a racist because I can't be a racist because I am not a racist because I am not a racist because I am not a racist because I am a racist because I am racist because I am racist because of my religion.
74,69,I wouldn’t want to believe you.
84,69,The president doesn't even have to wear a mask. He is trying to keep the healthcare system healthy.
87,69,Well he wasn't being trite. I think it's kind of the first time he's been like that.
91,69,The article states EPA & NRA have no authority to change the health care system and it would be more helpful for them to accept it. The AMA is about a skunk doing an AMA with a skunk guy who is trying to make the government look stupid. The story makes me think the issue is something that would be better spent on the people and not people addressing it.
94,69,"A little story, but he's a doctor, I wear a mask all the time. And I have a great smile."
69,18,You're racist because you're racist because you're racist because you're racist because you're racist because you're racist because you're racist because you're racist because you're racist because of your religion.
74,69,I don’t think you’re getting anything out of this post.
84,69,"I've always liked the first comment. I don't agree with it because it's very offensive, but I find that more effective than the last is to use a mask in public to prevent outbreaks. It seems like the mask is a good way to prevent a virus outbreak and is a good way to stop the spread of a virus."
87,69,I was about to give him the benefit of the doubt that a virus would come back when he did it to the government and he was actually in a better position to get vaccines. It is a bad idea.
91,69,AMA isn't the right answer.
94,69,"I can't believe that ""I'm a doctor and I wear a mask every day. It's the most effective means of stopping the spread of a virus."""
69,18,There's a lot of undocumented fucking indoctrination going on here.
74,69,"It isn't just about a joke, it is about a joke."
84,69,"""[I don't even have to wear a mask when he goes to his office to protect himself from being shot in the face. Wearing a mask in the us to stop the spread of a virus."
87,69,"The first part of the article is misleading, so I think the wiki article is misleading, because the first part is misleading."
91,69,"IANAL but the article is by the same author, and it’s interesting. The author of the article doesn’t seem to know how to be a good guy."
94,69,"You guys aren't just indoctrinated into religion. The government is trying to influence health issues, the government is trying to pressure people into a more rational stance. There is a lot of bias in the way people view the government."
69,18,"My mom has a friend who is an AMA and is the CDC. They also slammed him for wearing a mask, and have been doing that since the day the first AMA happened."
74,69,I'd be incredibly pissed if a guy like Obama had the nerve to put up with that joke. I'd be pissed if it were just a joke.
84,69,The CDC is the primary government agency. The president has a 'no control over healthcare policy'. Its a huge mistake to use this to protect the health of everyone. Its a huge mistake to use this to prevent the spread of a virus.
87,69,I'd rather not be a narcissist than be an idiot.
91,69,This is not a 'why don't you go wear a mask' AMA.
94,69,"I don't see any reason why people should wear a mask, except to avoid infection."
69,18,This is the biggest AMA about a skunk who is trying to make the government look stupid.
74,69,"They want to stop that and get the president to wear a mask, and the president will have to work against that."
84,69,"In what country are they going to be a problem? You know, the US and a lot of others?"
87,69,"I don't think anyone can go to a CDC event that requires you to wear a mask, but if it does happen it's at least a part of their effort to prevent a problem. They rely on people to see if it works and make it an effort, not just to get it out of their wallet."
91,69,"You know what I mean, this is not even a conversation... this is a conversation. Is the subject about the government?"
94,69,"You need a restraining order against people wearing a mask. It's not an effective solution and there's more of it at the moment than the ""sad"" issue."
69,18,">I don't even have to wear a mask when he goes to his office to protect himself from being shot in the face. Wearing a mask in the us to stop the spread of a virus. The first part of the article is misleading, so I think the wiki article is misleading, because the first part is misleading. IANAL"
74,69,">I just think that it’s just another joke about the government that’s making people uncomfortable."", ""I would be pissed if it were just a joke."""
84,69,"I don't see how this would help save the government's image, but I don't think this will change a lot in the future."
87,69,Vaccination is a health issue.
91,69,“We are a terrorist group and we are a terrorist organization. We are not responsible for the health care system.”
94,69,"There is a slant in the US that the government is trying to influence. The jokes are being made, the jokes are going to become actual, and the jokes are going to make them look a little more cliche and even cliche than they were before. They are being made."
69,18,I think this is the first time that a government agency has become so powerful it can start destroying everything.
74,69,I’m just going to say this. I’m not a Republican and I know that’s all that I have to say. I’m not even going to say this.
84,69,I think that's the only way I could see the guy being a skeptic being funny.
87,69,"I fought the CDC for years about a cdc omission and I fought a lot to get the cdc to reintroduce a sexism campaign. It's not a joke, a joke, or something like that."
91,69,The article is written by a lawyer. They are one of the main lobbies to end the government's funding of drug use and education in the US.
94,69,"Yes, it's a joke. That's how people view the government. But not all of it is bad. It's an issue."
69,18,So...it's not just a joke. It's a part of their policy.
74,69,It’s a joke.
84,69,"The NFL has been around a long time, and was a very popular organization."
87,69,I hate people who aren't vaccinated. I hate how they get mad that they have to wear a mask for a medical emergency and can't make an effort to take care of someone in an emergency.
91,69,CANNOTANSWER: 'I think this is a big problem for the NFL and that the current system is being overreacted.'
94,69,Are you a doctor? You have an allergy to the CDC? You've heard about them and you do not have one?
69,18,"That's not about the government, that's about how it's controlling a public health situation. It's about how it's using a sexist system to control people and a government that supports it. You don't think the government is to blame for a disease, that's just not the case in most of the cases, that's about how it's being abused."
74,69,"They want to ban vaccines pending. That doesn’t help the people who are infected, and the President needs to get vaccinations."
84,69,"It's been said to be very politically inaccurate, and I'm not saying it's wrong, but to have some sort of satire and a bit of an intellectual issue about it would probably be a good one. I think that's the only way I could see the guy being a skeptic being funny."
87,69,"You're an idiot. Vaccination is a sexism campaign. This is a good joke, but it's also an illegal one. The CDC is not making a joke."
91,69,"I don't know if the article is misleading but if the author is wrong and he is wrong, that's fine."
94,69,"I had the same problems when I went to the CDC. I was a doctor in a few states and I wore a mask every day. I was so nervous when I found out I didn't have one. So I was going to get the vaccine, but it was in my pocket..."
69,18,"Then he says he is a racist because he believes that people who want to be racist should know what he's talking about, and that the president can't afford to spend money to protect others. Then he states that he has no interest in his health, and he will probably wear a mask if it's necessary."
74,69,">As a Republican, I’d be interested in hearing more about this issue."
84,69,"I mean, the president of the United States is in no way responsible for protecting the environment, because he is the president of the country. He is a democrat and does not need to be able to have a presidential office as he is the president."
87,69,I am not sure if that's a joke but a joke that is not.
91,69,'The skunk guy' is an example of a man's pity for having to wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus.
94,69,"It's not a joke and it's a joke. People use it as a joke. If the government is trying to make it into an issue, it's not a joke."
69,18,"I've read the wiki article on the skunk guy, and it's the first time in a long time that the CDC has been publicly distancing itself from the government and is using it to cover up the epidemic of drugs in a large part."
74,69,"I figured out the joke by making a comment on the article. Besides, what about the first line?"
84,69,"People say the guy who made the joke is a skeptic but that it's actually a joke. It's a satire joke, and not a joke."
87,69,I have been talking to the CDC about vaccination for years and have not been able to understand how to answer.
91,69,"afaik it's not about a skunk. he was referring to a skunk, a guy with a skunk in a mask. i know the skunks are being scolded but they're skunks. I've had to go through two titties to see what the article says."
94,69,It's a joke. People use it as a joke.
69,18,Vaccination is a sexist system.
74,69,"""There’s no reason why people think they need to wear a mask if they can’t afford to go to a party in DC. I’ll probably buy one myself.'’"
84,69,"There are so many different reasons for a skeptic to make a joke, and so much of the same things are being made in the comments, even the ones that make a joke in the title, but it's a joke. The joke isn't a joke. It's just that a skeptic is making a joke and isn't being funny."
87,69,Vaccination is not an insurance issue. It's a health issue.
91,69,He's not referring to a skunk. He's referring to a skunk who is trying to stop the spread of the virus.
94,69,It is one of those jokes that is funny to me.
69,18,[https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination_is_a_sexist_system
74,69,It would be nice if I were the one to say 'this joke'. I don't think there's a reason that the media wants to force them to enforce a ban on it.
84,69,"OP, please have a seat at the president's inauguration in his seat. You may be able to do some of these things on your own."
87,69,">'""I think the whole idea of a mask as an anti-virus is a joke, and the fact that people are going to wear it to help spread the virus. If you really aren't going to be able to do that you need to go to a doctor, they should be able to help you do so. That's what they call a medical emergency and you can wear a mask""."
91,69,This is one of the few places that people have to know that the government has no authority to stop the spread of the virus.
94,69,Vaccination is NOT mandatory. It's a joke that the government isn't responsible for preventing and cure the spread of a virus.
69,18,Isn't it still a joke that the CDC wants to have it banned because a lot of people aren't aware of the truth or how the whole thing is not a joke?
74,69,">As a person who lives in Texas, so I understand the issue,"
84,69,So what's the point of getting a politician to wear a mask?
87,69,"> I'm a doctor, I am not a physician and the government has nothing to do with it."
91,69,'What the fuck'.
94,69,I'm a doctor and I wear a mask all the time. It's the most effective means of stopping the spread of a virus. The story was kind of hilarious.
69,18,What do you think is a joke?
74,69,"Its about how a guy wore a mask at a party. The guy said ""I want to wear a mask and we can take pictures of this man""... and not a joke."
84,69,A lot of these are about how to not let a politician be sick if you can't have a sane president. I don't think this is a joke. But the people on the fdr should do the narcissist thing and not the narcissist thing.
87,69,"I'm a doctor. I'm not a doctor, and the government has nothing to do with it. I do the things you described, but I'm a doctor. The CDC needs to make sure we can actually do this in a medical emergency and you're not getting that from the government, not the government."
91,69,"I agree with you that this article is a joke, not an actual fact, but an example of an article that makes it sound like it is not about the government. This isn't about the NRA."
94,69,It’s also a joke.
69,18,Vaccination is not a joke. The CDC is not responsible for stopping and stopping the spread of the virus. It is one of those jokes that is funny to me.
74,69,"It's the president's job to convince the media that all you need to do is lie about it, but it isn't a joke. You're going to see people in public, talking about it, saying you don't care about the situation you live in, and you're going to see people making a joke."
84,69,"CANNOTANSWER (R-NJ) he made this comment because he thinks the CDC should be in the national health care debate and the President should not be required to wear the mask. But, he also thinks the joke about the president should have been directed to the CDC and not the NFL. He believes that the CDC shouldn't be in the national health care debate or even the presidency. ""This isn't a joke."""
87,69,"Vaccination is not an insurance issue. It's a health issue. It's a health issue. It's a joke, but it's a joke."
91,69,This guy's a joke.
94,69,"Yes it is. It's an issue, and if you ARE a doctor and you wear a mask, you are a joke. If you're a doctor and you wear a mask, you have to wear a mask."
69,18,"Yes, this is a joke."
74,69,What's the point in wearing a mask?
84,69,"The NFL is very poorly funded, and they should have a vested interest in getting a healthy person in their team."
87,69,"I'm not a doctor, but I know that I would prefer to not wear a mask to avoid being killed by a virus."
91,69,It sounds like the AMA isn't about the NRA.
94,69,It doesn't make it a joke.
69,18,Vaccination is a sexist system. And it's not a joke.
74,69,"Why don't you just go to a party. You can't go. And you don't have to go to a party. I mean, why would you even go to a party?"
84,69,What kind of joke has this guy made about wearing a mask on the NFL?
87,69,What kind of joke is that?
91,69,You can't just rebrand the issue. You can't go through years of going through the media and finding information that isn't relevant.
94,69,It's not really the first time you've been here.
69,18,"This is the only thing I can think of in the world without any context, and I'm not saying it's the same, but that's about as far as I know. I just don't think he's doing that, or that he thinks the President is an important part of the problem and is not a competent person to deal with."
74,69,I'm actually going to look for a mask for a party in NYC in October and I will probably buy one myself.
84,69,"It sounds like you're talking about the NFL, which isn't a racist joke, but rather a joke about a guy in the fdr. He has a bad story for that."
87,69,I'm a Democrat and I haven't seen much of a joke that would be funny if I had the opportunity to go to a CDC event.
91,69,I'm a lawyer. I can speak for everyone.
94,69,"I have a friend who wears a mask every day - she gets a x virus every week and they also get a free booster vaccine for her and he goes to the doctor every day - they will see that she has a great smile despite not wearing a mask, if that helps."

74,69,">I was just talking about a bunch of people in Texas, who were just asking ""Why do you have to wear a mask?"""
84,69,CANNOTANSWER OP.
87,69,"This is a very good joke. It's just not one of those things that everyone is fucking a lot of people. It's a joke. It's not an insurance issue. It's a health issue. It's a joke, it's not a joke. It's a joke. It's not a joke."
91,69,"They said they had a ""relationship"" with a terrorist organization and that they were using a ""man's pity"" to keep the government from being able to stop the spread of the virus."
94,69,I'm not sure what the joke is about.
69,18,CANNOTANSWER OP.
74,69,"The CDC wants to ban vaccines pending. It is a joke that isn't legal in certain countries, so I don't think it's a joke."
84,69,"You're talking about the NFL, but you're talking about the NFL."
87,69,It sounds like a joke. It's not an insurance issue. It's a health issue. It's not an insurance issue.
91,69,"It's a joke, not a fact."
94,69,"Yes, people are trying to influence the government. It's a joke because it's a joke that the government is trying to influence, but you really need to figure out where to begin."
69,18,"In that case, he's a racist. Is he a racist?"
74,69,"As a nutjob who never went to a party that required a mask, I am really surprised the CDC is allowing anyone who wears a mask to wear a mask that is not legally required to wear a mask."
84,69,"The president of the US and his country are all masked and armed, which explains why people don't follow a lot of the rules, including the federal one. The NHL is on the verge of a national sceptic disorder, and a lack of support."
87,69,"They are making a joke about how doctors can't be insured for a medical condition, such as a vaccinated person with boosters or the government."
91,69,"The article is misleading, because it doesn't mention any specifics of any particular topics or points in the article. It doesn't mention any specifics of any particular topics or points in the article. There's nothing to be said about the EPA and NRA. It explains a lot about the issue. There are also people who, as I understand it, are extremely immature."
94,69,It doesn't really matter what it's used for.
69,18,"They're also saying that the vaccines are not allowed in most countries (and in most countries), because it's illegal to have vaccines available to anyone."
74,69,"If the president was wearing a mask, he would be in charge of preventing the spread of the virus. If he were wearing a mask in the past, he would be in charge of preventing it from spread. If he was not, he would not have gotten the disease. That would be the point."
84,69,This isn't going to change the fact that they have two parties at the same time.
87,69,"The people who voted for this one are being dicks, not pricks."
91,69,"""I don't think there's a right answer. But, I agree that people are going to see this film."", ""... and a new source for the entire story.'"""
94,69,"I'm not a doctor, but I'm sure that one of the main points of a medical device is to prevent people from getting a virus, rather than just getting one because they have one."
69,18,"I mean, I'm not in the minority in this discussion. I'm a Democrat."
74,69,People say that people don't get vaccinations.
84,69,"No. Because the government is a dick. Especially not one that can actually fight for their cause, like the CDC."
87,69,It's a joke.
91,69,"It's not a movie about the NRA, but it is about the NRA's trying to derail the health care system."
94,69,"""To have a helmet without a mask, I should be getting sick, even if I don't have a mask. I will wear a helmet and I am not going to get it. Vaccination isn't a joke. It's a joke because it's the government's job to prevent the spread of a virus."
69,18,"""I just want you to wear a mask and make sure you don't get sick while you're traveling to Georgia."""
74,69,"[In the CDC’s opinion, the President should wear a mask, but not in the event of a health or medical emergency. The president should wear a mask in order to reclaim his right to be vaccinated."
84,69,"""What kind of joke has this guy made about wearing a mask on the NFL?"""
87,69,"I'm not gonna say 'I'm not a doctor' but I'm aware that the government doesn't have any interest in the health of a person. I just know it's not my job, I'm a doctor, and it's not part of my job to get to a certain age.'"
91,69,"I feel like this article was written more or less like it is, but is more or less like something else. I just want to point out that it’s not about the government but what the article is about is."
94,69,"I can confirm this, but there's a bit of bias in the way people view the government."
69,18,Vaccination is a joke and the CDC is just using it to make people uncomfortable in their own country because they're the only group who actually have a legitimate reason to not use it in that situation.
74,69,"""Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. I don’t think the issue needs to be discussed in the primary. It needs to be addressed by the president and his staff. I’m not defending the president’s claim that he wore a mask to protect himself while he was at a party."
84,69,A nutjob joke is just a joke because it's wrong. It's a joke because it's wrong.
87,69,"That was a lot of jokes, and it's very funny' what some of those jokes were about."
91,69,"I have a misunderstanding about the NRA's purpose in trying to stop the spread of a virus. The issue isn't with the government, it's with the terrorists."
94,69,Vaccination is a joke because it's not a government job. It's a joke because people think it's a government job. They're trying to influence the government. It's not a joke because they believe it's a government job and that it's not a science job.
69,18,Vaccination is a joke and the CDC is just using it to make people uncomfortable in their own country because they're the only group who actually have a legitimate reason to not use it in that situation.
74,69,That is exactly how I think a mask works.
84,69,"'''Oh man, you should come to Georgia''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''"
87,69,Vaccination is a health issue. It is a health issue. It is not an insurance issue. It is a health issue. It is not an insurance issue. It is a health issue.
91,69,"[http://www.nlb.gov/publications/news/sluts.htm]. [I'm not sure how that's a crime. It's illegal to use a mask to stop the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask does, however, stop the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask does, however, stop the spread of a virus."
94,69,"""As a doctor, I wear a mask all the time. It's the most effective means of stopping the spread of a virus."""
69,18,In what way is a political campaign a joke?
74,69,"They're going to have to rethink what they want the President to do. It's not going to work, and it's not going to be a joke."
84,69,"So, what do you want for your office?"
87,69,I don't think anyone has a valid claim that the government wants to prevent or even respond to the death of anyone unless they are a prick.
91,69,"So the only issue is that the president has put out a huge fucking statement about how he's not a racist, and not about the government's inability to get rid of his own security measures. Vaccination is an illegal crime in the US."
94,69,"Vaccination is a joke because people aren't aware of it, and the joke isn't the joke it is a joke."
69,18,Vaccination is a sexist system. It's a sexist system. It's a joke. But a joke is a joke. This isn't a 'political campaign'. This is the'real'question.
74,69,"""...I’m sure the CDC would like to abolish all vaccinations as much as possible, unless they go over the entire cost of a vaccine or require an insurance policy."""
84,69,It is a joke because it is wrong. It is a joke because it's wrong.
87,69,I think you've figured out the meaning of that sexist joke.
91,69,The article is about the NRA trying to stop the spread of a virus. The article is about how the government is trying to stop the spread of a virus.
94,69,I am so sorry for your loss.
69,18,They don't want to get rid of the anti-vaccination movement and use it to control the state. They want to go for that.
74,69,I don’t understand why the CDC wanted to ban vaccinations pending. Because it was a joke. The idea of the ACA was one of the ill advised things in the US to prevent the spread of the disease.
84,69,The entire point of this whole article is to illustrate the absurdity of this sub. It would have been interesting for the OP to explain a couple of different aspects of this post.
87,69,So basically the same thing happened at a gay wedding last week. I had a sex drive. You would be the most naive op in the world.
91,69,"It was the article I came from. I thought it was a joke because I wanted to make sure there were no ""as a joke"" comments at all in this post."
94,69,Why do you have such a great smile?
69,18,> Vaccination is an illegal crime in the US. Vaccination is an illegal crime in the US.
74,69,The last sentence is a little confusing.
84,69,That's a ridiculous joke. It's not a joke because it's wrong.
87,69,"It's not a joke, it's a joke, it's a joke."
91,69,"I don't like the AMA, but I can only imagine that, unless it's a nihilism joke."
94,69,It's a joke because it's the government's job to prevent the spread of a virus.
69,18,Why are you saying that the whole article is misleading?
74,69,"In an interview with The Guardian, [Autumn Day](https://www.thearticle.com/news/article/2009/01/twitchcon-twitch-con-detail.aspx) the CDC called Obama ""a good joke"" for being so ""hilarious"" that he called him ""a dickhead "" because he didn't even want to wear a mask and he wouldn't want to wear it,"" and that it was an ad hominem joke."
84,69,The first thing I noticed was that I didn't actually see the joke. I thought it was some kind of joke that was going to come across as funny and to actually explain why. I've got some things to do.
87,69,I'm saying the first two sentences 'I'm gonna say this about twitchcon and masks you can hate me if the state town doesn't have an mandates'and 'I don't understand why you think a mask would be a good idea'
91,69,The article is essentially about how the government is not taking responsibility for the health care system. The government is trying to stop the spread of a virus. Vaccination is an illegal crime in many states.
94,69,"As a doctor, I wear a mask every day. That's the most effective means of stopping the spread of a virus."
69,18,"I'm not a doctor, but I'm just a doctor and I am not in any way racist."
74,69,The joke was meant to make a joke and not be a joke.
84,69,>I think a lot of the skepticism that comes with the federal government's approach to protecting health care should be put to rest.
87,69,"A lot of people don't know what a joke is. It's in my top three most popular r/judgements of all time. Whenever I use a joke, I think ""What is it that is a joke?"" or ""What if I am not a joke?"""
91,69,A lot of things don't seem clear in the article.
94,69,"They're trying to influence the government and it's not even the problem. They are preventing the onset of a virus, and so they're promoting the idea that you have to get a mask to protect yourself if you don't want to get your face scratched. The article has made clear that this isn't a joke and that they're trying to influence the government."
69,18,The CDC is making a big deal out of this.
74,69,A rebuttal to that sentence would be:
84,69,"> ""It seems like the mask is a good way to prevent the spread of a virus. I think that the whole idea of wearing a mask is so old and boring to me. It's so funny. I couldn't believe how big it is that we don't have the money or authority to prevent that virus."", ""Is there any other reason that people don't know about it and can't think of a good reason not to get vaccinated."""
87,69,'Vaccination is a health issue. It is a health issue. It is not an insurance issue. It is not an insurance issue. It is not an insurance issue. It is not an insurance issue. It is a health issue.
91,69,It's a joke. That's why you can't write a joke that's really fucking funny.
94,69,"In the US, when I was a child, I thought it was just that they don't think a mask is necessary to prevent people from getting sick, so they put on the masks."
69,18,I'm glad that the article isn't misleading.
74,69,"If Obama had been able to show up at the party and was able to get away with that, why do he still wear a mask? Is it not a joke? Because he would a joke."
84,69,"The president doesn't really need to be wearing a mask to prevent a virus, and is doing a lot of things to keep it out of the public eye. Vaccination is a serious issue, and if it isn't done early, it's no way to prevent it from happening. Those things are going to be worse than they are now, and I would say it's just ridiculous."
87,69,The point is to make the point that it's a joke.
91,69,There's more to this than just the AMA. It's the AMA — not the one that isn't the actual one — and it's a joke.
94,69,"Vaccination is not a joke, because it is the government's job to stop the spread of a virus."
69,18,"No, i am not a racist."
74,69,"Obama is the one that's being made fun of because he didn't get sick while in DC, that he's wearing a mask."
84,69,It's one of the reasons people think they can vaccinate a president while he is in office.
87,69,"I'm not a doctor. I think I'm a doctor, but I know that the CDC has a legitimate interest in the public's health."
91,69,I think the AMA is about how the government has become a bigger threat.
94,69,"What the hell is a joke about wearing a mask because it's the worst thing that could happen? Like, why is a helmet needed?"
