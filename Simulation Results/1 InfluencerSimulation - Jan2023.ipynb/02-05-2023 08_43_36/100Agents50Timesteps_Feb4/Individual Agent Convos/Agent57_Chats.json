    "The joke is, in fact, an underlying message. It's a joke, a piece of shit that's been made public.",
    "i'm gonna say this, the petty joke that is posted isn't actually funny.",
    "I thought the title was kinda funny, but I think a lot of the comments are a little over the top. It seems like he is trying to sell the idea of a female as a woman, but a male as a sexist joke?",
    "CANNOTANSWER.",
    "I've been wearing a mask in my house and I've been feeling great about myself. When it was a joke I wore it all the time to my face, not for anyone. It's been a few years since I've ever worn it and I can't even tell you how much more miserable it was than when it was a joke.",
    "Its a joke, but they are not making it a joke.",
    "I've been wearing a mask all the time for a few years now. No way it was a joke.",
    "It is an interesting point. This is about the politics of the US.",
    "I know the topic, and it sucks to hear that he is trying to push for this kind of nonsense. He was trying to show people he is being a bit, but he's not being sexist. You are not wrong. People who think this is a joke will be happy with themselves but they won't be happy with being sexist if they don't get to hear it or get to know the joke.",
    "You know, the people who think this is a joke (they know he's trying to sell the idea of a sexist joke, because they're all women) probably have a different story.",
    "What a man! I wish we had that guy wearing the same mask all the time, he was so cute, and the whole \"I don't know what I'd wear\" thing was an incredible thing to be the same size as me.",
    "CANNOTANSWER.",
    "This is the right question. You just told me that you think wearing a mask for a few days is a joke, but it's not a joke.",
    "As long as it's a joke, it's the right joke."
