37,29,i like the part when he got covid but still had events with people and how he won t enforce a statewide mask mandate oh and the part where he cut education funding wow so great
40,29,continuing to mask up and distance reduces the transmission of the virus and if you do get it the virus won t leave you your immune system will handle it vaccines also reduce pressure on overwhelmed healthcare systems vaccines mean more milder cases if the vaxxed do get it
43,29,as someone who was there this weekend who lives in a conservative county in california the residents of texas where kind respectful and upheld mask ordinance better than mins of being back in california please let s not turn our backs on people who need help
47,29,those who want to protect themselves from getting sick have every right to masks keep you more safe than no mask in tight settings everyone has the right to do whatever they want now at their discretion
50,29,can we developed a mask or helmet that will protect us from corona and that everyone would have to wear to go outside for a month or that would allow us to open up the economy again
51,29,two tri county health dept board members from douglas county voted against the mask public health order and one did not vote due to affiliation to a school

29,8,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
29,13,Is that the statewide mask mandate or something else?
29,16,"So, you wore a mask for an event that was scheduled to begin on January 1st, 1923. Then, after that you would have to rip out your vest, or use your head as a shield and take off the mask to the hospital?"
37,29,I think he really should have a statewide mask mandate and one that would protect people from the virus? I think he should be ashamed of the government and the people who use it.
40,29,"That is really very interesting how this works. In fact, it is one of the first things i saw in the last few weeks."
43,29,"No, it won't be trump if he can get his own mask because he doesn't like the idea of people being made to take care of a virus."
47,29,"I'm still not sure if this actually does, because there is no indication that the vaccines work in tight settings. I'm surprised people want to be vaccinated and not get sick because they have to wear a mask."
50,29,They are still illegal in a bunch of states.
51,29,"What a waste of time! We are going to see a mask ban soon, and this is a time to come down to the issues with them."
52,29,"You are correct, wearing a mask does not prevent the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
61,29,"I'm afraid to say it but I'm still going to put on my mask if it's not required on my part. This means I have a virus that cannot be vaccinated, but I m afraid to say the mask is not mandatory for this particular state. It's not mandatory at all."
65,29,"It is not necessary to wear a mask, but it is an essential part of the health and well being of a person who should be protected if they want to. Wearing a mask also doesn't help prevent the spread of the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
75,29,This is actually a very funny phrase. I really love this guy.
76,29,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.yes the newest strain is soooooo contagious just bc they have a mask on their hands pics don t mean they re using it

29,8,This is actually a very funny phrase.
29,13,"I'm not surprised to hear this, but I don't think it's a good idea. Especially if the government is trying to 'protect' people from a virus."
29,16,The first part of the sentence is very obnoxious. I find it so interesting how his attempt at protecting the public is so strong and so eloquent. Is he supposed to be a man of wit?
37,29,"OP, this is the first time i've heard a quote about the ""Making a mask"" issue. This is about the government's attempt to cut the budget to prevent people from spreading the virus."
40,29,> Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.can we develop a mask or helmet that will protect us from corona and that everyone would have to wear to go outside for a month or that would allow us to open up the economy again oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that
43,29,That's a pretty bad idea and a bit insulting. The government is not at the bottom of the list of problems.
47,29,If you want to get vaccinated you have to wear a mask.
50,29,"The issue is, you're wearing a mask. I'm a govt, and you're not against it, but you're saying that they need to be allowed to wear a mask, and the government shouldn't force you to."
51,29,"I think we should rethink our attitudes towards masks... if you have to wear a mask for any reason, it snuffs."
52,29,He's not the king of the internet.
61,29,Are you a Republican? What are you wearing in the first place? I think the guy is an incompetent idiot who can eat a sandwich for his meal. He is also a degenerate who can eat pizza for his food. The trick is to eat more pizza. If I eat it i can go eat more pizza.
65,29,You are right that masks can't be used to stop the spread of a virus.
75,29,"You are not the one who said you were being lied to by your family, you are the one who said that you have the right to choose the kind of protection that you want to get from your family."
76,29,"I don't have an actual understanding of what he's saying or what the difference between the two is, but in general there is a very good chance of getting sick without the help of a professional."
77,29,"I believe the person in question said, but they certainly seemed to disagree."
78,29,I've got to go.
79,29,IANAL and a few others haven't commented on the 'I don't believe'part of the government mandates.

43,29,"People are the people who have the scars to protect themselves and others. They are the people who can take care of themselves. They are the people that can do whatever they want, but who don't want to be held accountable for their actions. They are the people who have a responsibility to protect themselves and others.

The government is trying to stop the spread of a virus so that the public can wear it. Vaccines are very effective. I think there is a lot of evidence that it actually works in tight settings, but we're seeing it as a threat that doesn't necessarily apply to those who don't have vaccinations. I'm a lot of people who aren't "
50,29,">I like to make fun of the man who wears a mask (like what I have seen a couple of times, the mask was a real part of what I was doing) and that's one of his accomplishments. The fact that he's wearing it properly under a helmet, despite the reality of what happened is a humbling sign."

52,29,"I am not sure what is going on but what I am seeing is that people get sick of wearing masks. If the mask gets too much oxygen and doesn't let you breathe, then he has to wear it."
61,29,A CDC report that states that we can not go to a TWitchCon event where a virus will not be vaccinated is that this is a problem with the federal government? That seems to be an interesting question.
65,29,"You can do what you want with a mask. And to do that with a mask is a good idea. I don't like to think of them as a joke, but it's not something that you would want to use unless it works."

77,29,What does a mask require to do to stop the spread of a virus? Does it require that the person wearing the mask have some sort of medical condition or other condition?

29,13,"I'm not a very well educated person, but there are a lot of good people who wear masks in places where they're not even a possibility."
29,16,I think it's a really clever idea to wear a mask outside on some job that is very tight but has a lot of health benefits.
37,29,My parents had to do something similar to this in school. They had to wear a mask to get the vaccine. They have to take a mask and give the child a mask. Then they had to change it.
40,29,> You are a pretty ignorant fuck. Probably not a very good skeptic.
43,29,Wearing a mask in public would be a very safe move. It would save the people who were sick from getting sick and the ones who were vaccinated.
47,29,"I mean, the government may be just as important to vaccinate the people who aren't being protected as a small number of people who don't have theirs. But it's not like 'waving a mask' is a bad idea."
50,29,A mask is a piece of medical equipment that is used by the government to prevent spread of the virus.
51,29,"I think that's a good point. We are attempting to combat the spread of a virus. It's not as if people in the U.S. are at all, but the idea that it's actually not is just silly."
52,29,"As a result of the health problems that may have been caused by being under a mask, we are putting in the effort to prevent it from spreading. So for some people, the only way to protect themselves is to wear a mask."
61,29,I would not think of it as a problem with the government. I think that there are plenty of people who think that the government is invading an entire nation.
65,29,">In the US, a mask is one of the most effective means for preventing the spread of the virus."
75,29,[Donald J. Trump has an interview with a guy claiming to have a hard time breathing because of his mask.

95,29,"The only way we can stop the spread of a virus is to put a shield on all the people that want to try to prevent it. And the mask is supposed to protect his head from the air, and helps prevent a terrorist attack on him. It's not a sex act."
29,8,"Having a mask around your face could do the trick. There's no harm to wear it outside, but at the same time, the protection isn't needed."
29,13,"I read this in The Huffington Post's voice, and it sounds like a bit of a skewed post on wikipedia. I'm a little unsure as to whether the words are actually in the same sentence. I was born in the UK, and while I had worked in a very tight environment, I was more concerned about it in a more relaxed manner. In the UK, I'm very aware but I think I'm not a very well educated person. I'm not surprised that the ACA was written in the first place."
29,16,They're saying that this is one of the best ways to keep people away from spreading the virus.

79,29,You think they are a waste of time? What's wrong with the way the US government treats us in a system of government mandates? I just don't think they actually have any effect on our health and safety.
95,29,There's a whole bunch of reasons why the government does this.
29,8,"I'm a democrat and I don't know the difference between what I read and what I read. I don't care whether it is a joke, but I'd like to tell you how I'm going to take the time to read it because I can't really understand the language."
29,13,"Vaccinating people, not being the only reason we are allowed to be vaccinated."
29,16,"I would be shocked to learn that this is an innocuous and racist phrase that was only used in the US and never translated. It's like saying 'There's nothing wrong with the government, it's just that people don't use it'. It's like saying, 'There's nothing wrong with the government.'"
37,29,So a guy in a suit on my birthday is wearing a mask and he is going to be sick?
40,29,"They should be putting more money into research and development, not just for government money."
43,29,>The only reason people wear a mask is because it is designed to help stop the spread of a virus.
47,29,A guy I'm going to make a point about:
50,29,">A mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.There are dozens of things you can talk about that are not legal, and are often just fucked up. There's even an article that says they could have been used to prevent people from spreading AIDS. There's even an article that says they could have been used to help prevent people from spreading AIDS. People who haven't made a single public comment in the last 3 weeks can still be put in the same situation as those who aren't fucked up."
51,29,"I'm not sure what I feel. I have no idea if the government will be able to ban it because they're out to save people. But I just can't see why people would do it if they don't know about it if they know they are getting sick, which is a really interesting point."
52,29,So I'm not going to go ahead and say it's a dick move. I'm just pointing out that the government hasn't done anything to stop the spread of a virus. I just mean the guy who said he'd go wear his face mask if the government didn't go out and try and save his life is not the king of the internet. Isn't that kind of a prick move? You are not going to do that.
61,29,I think the government is invading an entire nation. It's not just a political issue.
65,29,"This is a good point. My mother wears a mask to protect her from a deadly illness - the flu - and she wears a mask to prevent it from getting her mother to have a child with a vaccine. The doctors are the government, not the people. It doesn't make any sense."
75,29,I'm not sure I've read it enough to know for sure if you're referencing the story. But I don't think it's in reference to the movie.
76,29,It seems like these people have no idea how to understand these threats.

52,29,It's a joke. It's not about whether or not you think it's funny. The government should be able to prevent the spread of viruses. They should prevent them from spreading. It's just that they are trying to make it easier for the public to stop it.
61,29,"There's actually a huge amount of data that is being provided by the CDC. They're not just trying to protect the public from the government, but a lot of them do, and the government hasn't stepped in to prevent it.

50,29,"If the CDC wants to change the law, it will be up to the state to decide whether they want to do a new policy. Then they will be able to change the law to not prevent AIDS."
51,29,He is a terrible President. He is going to put on a mask to keep people safe and it should be a mandatory condition unless it is a virus.
52,29,This is the first time I've ever heard of a government putting a mask on public health workers to help prevent a virus from spreading. I've never heard that before but this guy is an asshole.
61,29,"I think the point of the article is that it says that the government is invading an entire nation. The implication is that the US government is a depraved petty petty, and there are a lot of ways for government to control public policies. It is not the case for everyone in the US. It is a petty joke, but not a criminal one, in my opinion."
65,29,"I read that the reason 'they're using them as an excuse to help people, not just their own health' was that people can get a vaccine without wearing a mask. You can do what you want with a mask. And to do that with a mask is a good idea. I don't like to think of them as a joke, but it's not something that you would want to use unless it works."
75,29,The fact that you're trying to bring this into the mainstream is hilarious.
76,29,Isn't that part of the government's responsibility to keep people safe? That's what most people are concerned about.

29,16,It's a joke. And to use a mask outside on a job that is very tight but has a lot of health benefits.

52,29,This is the beginning of a series of articles where the author and the CDC all give similar opinions. I would be surprised if there was any actual evidence that a mask that gets too much oxygen and doesn't let you breathe is actually a real threat to people and that there are people who aren't in the room to stop them from spreading a virus. They're just trying to make themselves aware of what the issue is.

61,29,I think the problem with it is that the government is invading an entire nation. They have been unable to issue vaccines in the past. But they are trying to sabotage this idea by not making people on their health care vaccinated and giving them the proper information.

75,29,"So it’s not funny at all. We have a really hard time making it past people. The truth is, there is only one way."
76,29,The article was written by a man in a suit against the CDC in which he tries to get the CDC to stop his helmets from going up and down a hill.
77,29,Why would a public health sailor want to wear a mask if he's the head of the school?
78,29,I'd be too. I'd like people to get a face mask as a precaution.
79,29,"I haven't seen any skunks before. You can take a photo of one in the park and take pictures with it. I'd do it to show the pranksters. I've seen a lot of it, but I haven't seen any skunks."

29,13,"I think it's a joke, but a prank."
29,16,There's a lot of information out there on the CDC. It's just that the federal government is the source of this. I can't think of a single source that gives the CDC a list of places to put a mask on and how many of them use it. The only thing I can think of is to put it on my hat.
37,29,OP. There is no joke.
40,29,"A ""skunk mask"" is a joke. A skunk mask prevents an infection, and is called ""a joke"" (as in ""I think they should be putting more money into research and development, not just for government money)."

61,29,It is a good idea. It is a very good idea. This is why they need to do something.
65,29,I think it's a joke.
75,29,So what exactly is a prank?
76,29,"People that don't want to get tested for the flu need to get vaccinated. If they want to get tested, they need to find a medical professional."
77,29,"It's a joke about the CDC, preventing spread of a virus."

51,29,A reversal of that is in the back of your mind. The actual joke is not a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke. It's not a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke.
52,29,"I think the issue is that he isn't the leader of the government's ""horrible"" campaign."
61,29,I think a bit of a cliche is used to describe the fact that the federal government doesn't have a mandate on health insurance. You could say that the government isn't able to pass laws to prevent the spread of the virus and he isn't going to be able to help the federal government.
65,29,People who wear a mask are likely to be sick for a reason.

Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
79,29,I just want to note that the actual joke is about what a prank actually is. But a big joke.
95,29,"I just wanted to point out that this isn't the end of the world. I was just pointing out that there is a lot more to the message than just that, but the context has been very clear in this thread that the government is trying to stop the spread of a virus."

50,29,The EPA is asking the CDC about a law to allow people to wear the mask based on the news.
51,29,No way. But I can see a joke that is sarcastic about the President and not how he's been trying to stop the spread of the virus.
52,29,"The CDC is working on a new legislation called ""An ACA"" that helps stop the spread of HIV."
61,29,Vaccination is a crime. It's not a joke because it doesn't address the problem. It is a joke because it doesn't address the problem. The only implication is that the government isn't a good government.
65,29,Because I do not believe you.
75,29,"Well, as I pointed out in the original post, this is pretty much the whole point of the joke. The EPA and NRA want to make vaccines illegal, but if this joke is going to go viral."
76,29,The CDC is suing the government for not making a better health care system.
77,29,I think I'm the only one who thinks this is a joke.
78,29,"It's a joke to make fun of the ACA, the ACA prevents the spread of the disease."

29,13,I'm sure that's why this is a joke. It's a joke.
29,16,This is about the lack of awareness of health and healthcare in the US and the fact that the public is not receiving the benefits of vaccines. This is also a joke about how the government is trying to protect people from the government.
37,29,The AMA is written by a group of people who support the anti-virus movement. The article states that people don't wear a mask to prevent the spread of a virus. That's just the state's policy.
40,29,"""People sometimes take the joke as a way to make their job seem like they have a valid job."
43,29,I'd say there's a lot of good comments here.

50,29,CANNOTANSWER.
51,29,Is there any way that he's got a chance to have a laugh at the fact that he doesn't have the mask at all?
52,29,The issue is that the ACA has been abused. That's not the point of the ACA.
61,29,"I'm not a fan of the ACA. I'm a fan of the people, I'm in support of this ACA. It's a joke that is a joke."
65,29,CANNOTANSWER: ''The mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
75,29,"No, this joke is about the government not the CDC. The CDC has a huge and unfounded threat to public health."
76,29,The article is a joke because it's about the government.
77,29,"Having the CDC as an organization for the public health sector isn't a joke. It's an issue that's in the national curriculum, not just for the CDC."
78,29,"The issue is with that. The ACA is the answer to the issue and not the way you should be. I would be upset about the ACA, and not have a conversation about the ACA if I'm going to the Twitchcon."
79,29,"""The government isn't the government because the CDC has to do something. It's not the government, it's the government."""
95,29,You have a very strong position here. But I just have to point out that I've never heard of this idiom before.
29,8,"A lot of the jokes I heard in the AMA are about a government that is a joke, the ACA isn't about it. There's a lot of people who are opposed to the ACA, as well as conservatives. You're being a twat."
29,13,"I don't think it's a joke, I think it's just a joke. It's a joke that the CDC is trying to try to keep the US from being attacked by the government."
29,16,The CDC has a huge and unfounded threat to public health.
37,29,Then I'll get to the point of telling my doctor that I think this is a joke because the doctor has no understanding of AIDS. I feel like my doctor could be doing better without any real discussion.
40,29,"I ain't sure what you're getting from the rest of this post. This seems like a fairly typical joke, if not much more serious, than it really is."
43,29,I didn't write any of these responses. I only wrote them because I really liked the first part.
47,29,I think there is a reason why the ACA is not a joke.
50,29,I was a medical student for about a year. I learned about this in college. And I learned that the FDA is a very common drug that has been known to cause a lot of cancers in certain states. That's why I asked the CDC to study it. That's just so much better than that.
51,29,You are doing your job. We are making fun of this.
52,29,The ACA is the main reason why people can't be more critical of what the gov't is doing. I'm not sure what the joke is about.
61,29,I see it as a very valid reason to support the ACA (although I have a long history of HIV/AIDS). Having a mask doesn't seem to be a valid reason.
65,29,It's a joke because it's a joke and it's a joke because it's a joke.

78,29,"I have heard these jokes before, and I think I understand what they mean. I like it when people joke about it because it's a good idea, but I don't want to be the one to think it's a joke. The idea is ridiculous, because it doesn't. The ACA was repealed as a joke because it doesn't really help stopping the spread of the virus."
79,29,It's not like this is an idiocy. It's a joke about people's medical conditions. A prank is a joke.

29,16,The one I've heard most often is that when a person is wearing a mask (even a 'wrong' mask) they're usually not concerned that they might spread the disease. It's a joke in and of itself.
37,29,>The article states that people don't wear a mask to prevent the spread of a virus. It's a joke because it's about the government. It is a joke because it's about the government.
40,29,I don't think I have any idea what you mean.
43,29,I think you are in the wrong here. The article is a misunderstanding of the meaning of the phrase.
47,29,Vaccines work and the CDC doesn’t care about the people who have them. The president doesn’t care about them.

52,29,It's a joke.
61,29,It's a joke. It's a joke. I’m not a fan of the ACA but I’m a fan of people who can’t go to events that don’t involve a CDC report. Having a mask is a joke. Having a mask is a joke. It’s a joke.
65,29,"The idea of a mask causing people to have HIV/AIDS, when the CDC is trying to do something about it, ''I don't want to give up'', 'This is one of the most effective ways to prevent this from happening, I don't think the CDC is attempting to prevent this from happening, I don't think this should have been mentioned in the title, but that seems to be the joke."

78,29,"I'm in the US for a business. Is this the ACA, the health care Act, or something?"
79,29,The CDC isn't in any way a joke. There's a reason they make jokes about the government - their job is to make fun of a virus.
95,29,You can be a joke if you choose to.
29,8,"I don't know if this is a joke, but what a joke."
29,13,So basically every US citizen who is in the US can have a vaccine but the US is a prank.
29,16,"It’s pretty obvious that this one of the most offensive things I’ve ever heard about the CDC is a joke about people wearing a mask to prevent the spread of a virus. This is a joke about what was and was in the national curriculum, the ACA and, of course, the health care act. It’s also a joke about how we’ve not had much access to the health care in many countries. That’s one of the main reasons for them having the CDC."
37,29,"Isn't it a joke if someone does the ""what if?"" question to you about a joke or the government?"

51,29,"It's not even a joke. It's a joke that the government is trying to make it illegal, even though it's not illegal in the U.S., and they are making fun of the president."
52,29,The point of ACA is the public's right to feel protected from anything that they have to give them. It's a joke. The people who say this thing aren't going to be doing anything to stop the spread of the disease. It's a joke.

You are a joke, but you are a joke. Then there's the whole, ""shit is a bad idea."" I would tell you that the article isn't a joke. The joke is made to be fun because it isn't supposed to be fun."
77,29,The government has no business making a joke about a joke about the government. The CDC is a big business. They are a big business.
78,29,"I would be angry if this was a joke, I'd be mad if I was being sarcastic. I just found a way to take the joke of a vaccine. It's not a joke."
79,29,It is not a joke. It is a joke. And it isn't a joke.
95,29,The first part of the meme is very jarring.
