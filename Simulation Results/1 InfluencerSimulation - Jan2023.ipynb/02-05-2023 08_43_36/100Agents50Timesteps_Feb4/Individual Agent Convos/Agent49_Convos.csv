89,49,"I would consider a mask of some kind, that I could put on someone else's face. My husband wears it as a way to stop people from feeling so sick, and it protects him from a virus, but the issue isn't that I have a good deal of contact with the sick person in public, it's that I've been trying to prevent it from spreading in public and it's not something I can do."

I don't think a person in a state that has a virus can change. We have an order for the health department to tell their commissioners what to do to prevent this. We don't want to go on and on about the government's handling of the situation. So I don't think the problem isn't that he's wrong about putting it on someone else's face, but that"

49,47,You’re trying to say that it’s not a real answer and you’re trying to say the right one.
52,49,I don't know why you're saying you don't like wearing a mask. You like wearing a mask. You like the hat. I like a hat for the flu. But I don't like wearing a mask. I like the hat idea. Yes. I think they should be able to keep it in. But that doesn't mean it isn't useful.
64,49,I do not think it's the best way to address the problem but you know what's really important here is for people to think and not just read what the article says and just to eat some hotdogs
70,49,"In a similar vein, if you like the guy who wears a mask and wear it properly under a helmet then yes, you are a goddamn bad guy."

49,47,"The mask's supposed to prevent the spread of virus if it is infecting the blood flow into the heart of a child. If it's not, it's not. A guy who's on the cover of a mask will get shot in the face, but the fact that he didn't wear it, means he doesn't get shot, and he needs to be on the cover of a mask in order to get a sclera of that kind of fucked up vaccine, and the government will sclera"

64,49,"The EPA is using the word ""fake"" in a way that might be unprofessional. Wearing a mask outside or in your car alone is a really dangerous thing. And I think you're right, there are some people out there that don't have a sense of humor. But, the government is not willing to admit that their behavior is wrong or a good thing. And what about the people who said ""I'm not gonna lie"" or something like that."
70,49,It's ridiculous. You are a prick and your lack of self-esteem is ridiculous.
87,49,"I think a lot of people want to do it in private, but a lot of people don't."
89,49,"It sounds like there is a problem in the political world, that people are not doing that in a public place. The government may try to prevent the spread of a virus, but that is a good question."
97,49,"In my country, that would be a twat. He's trying to get government to respond to the news and get out, and I have no idea why."

52,49,"I'm a massive fan of the hat, and I've never worn one before but I can hardly remember the last time I ever put on a mask on a person. I wore a hat on a pigeon when I was a kid, i had no idea."
64,49,"EPA has a new study showing that when people are asked to wear a mask at school, it can largely help prevent the spread of a virus.... so there's no harm in throwing up at people who wear a mask and get a jab."
70,49,You're just saying I don't like wearing a mask. The issue is that the coach wore a mask because it was uncomfortable and not a proper helmet. It's ridiculous. You are a prick and your lack of self-esteem is ridiculous.
87,49,I think this is why people wear a mask to get an infection.
89,49,"... and if there is no problem in the political world, that people are not doing that in a public place, then I think the ol'mask dick is a red flag."
97,49,"I don't think this should be funny. The truth is, I've always wanted to watch a movie about the ""Fight Club""."
49,4,"So, if the article argues that the EPA is ""not willing to admit that their behavior is wrong or a good thing,"" then the problem is that the EPA is using the word ""fake"" in a way that might be unprofessional."
49,8,"In my opinion, it is very risky to go outside with a friend to a zoo to eat or watch the game. If you want to be a tourist and not be involved in a fight, there is a risk of being shot, and the idea of getting a vaccine is pretty much fucked up."
49,30,It was the kind of thing I like to do when I am sick. I don't suck it up.
49,47,"I don't see anything wrong with wearing a mask in public, but that's a pretty big deal, really."
52,49,"There is a thing called ""a hat"" that teaches people to wear masks and use them to prevent virus spread. It's basically what the government is about, but in the end it's still there to stop it."
64,49,The question is if it is acceptable for the board to put on a mask. It is not acceptable for the public to use it in a public place.

87,49,I believe it's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
89,49,"I'm going to be like, what? Are you going to wear a mask in the workplace? Why would you want to go out and be sick, because if you're not willing to leave, and you don't want to be on the job, are you going to be sick, because your husband can get HIV/AIDS? Then the problem isn't that you have a good deal of contact with someone in the public, it's that you've been trying to prevent it from spreading in public? There's also a mask that could help the government prevent HIV/"
97,49,"They're trying to be racist. Basically, they're saying that people in a mask must be in their twenties and they need to be told what they should be saying."
49,4,"If there aren't enough people in the US, you're not on the right track. The government is not on the right track, and in fact I would assume that the situation is inherently racist. It would be nice to hear this sort of thing, but I don't have a bad feeling."
49,8,I don't get it. I've had to deal with a twat a lot lately.
49,30,"The problem is, that people wearing a mask in the public are not safe and that the government is doing it because it is a big deal in the political world."
49,47,"It's a little late to the party, but some of the more disturbing things are going on with the news. Apparently, it's an issue of the vaccine being a twat."
52,49,The government isn't trying to stop the spread of a virus.
64,49,>I think it's a very serious problem and needs to be investigated.
70,49,"What a pathetic, dumb person you are."
87,49,"In that context, I don't think people wear masks to prevent an illness. Instead they wear an antibiotic in the event the person is infected and their body has a bad reaction to it. This is because, according to the doctor, a vaccine doesn't have to be a vaccine that is needed to protect people from an infection, and thus causes less health consequences than being vaccinated."
89,49,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.You are the narcissistic, insular person. I am sorry, but I also wish to say this isn't as good as I think it is, because he probably has no clue. I am just hoping it will be better for me. I’m a republican, and a Republican in a nutjob, I’m a republican. I’m just so unhelpful."
97,49,"I'm a big fan of the Trump administration, but I think it is a good idea to have a face mask."
49,4,I agree that they're not doing anything wrong based on what we have learned from the article. The fact that you have to wait to go see the doctor when you need to get vaccines is a bit twat to me.
49,8,"The problem is, that people wearing a mask in the public are not safe and that the government is doing it because it is a big deal in the political world."
49,30,I'm going to leave now because I have to start getting a job I can't get the money for.
49,47,"So, how do people who can't get the vaccine don't go outside?"
52,49,"""We don't like wearing a mask. I like wearing a mask. You like wearing a mask. You like wearing a hat. I like the hat idea. Yes. I think they should be able to keep it in. But that doesn't mean it isn't useful."""

70,49,"I am sorry, you are being like him, but that makes it even more outrageous."
87,49,This is not the answer you need.
89,49,"No, this is why the government is mandated to get people to be vaccinated."
97,49,People who are fucking hate the president aren't being racist. I'm from Georgia. I hate this guy because he is a joke. I hate how he is attempting to become a racist and I can't even help but look like a neoconservative. I've been in the US for 2 years and have always felt safe. I've been a big fan of his as well. His stance on the situation makes me wonder if he would come to the country and change his style.
49,4,"The guy I hated in the interview is the guy from the TV show “The Truth, “ about how the President is a joke that is on display. I like the hat idea because I like it, but that doesn’t mean it’s useful.” He gets no response."
49,8,The question is who actually said it?
49,30,"Those people, even the people who aren't racist. I'd be really surprised if Trump was actually racist."
49,47,I think you're a bit oversimplifying the stance here. That a man wearing a mask is going to get shot?
52,49,"They should put a hat on people who like it. They should be able to keep it in. They should be able to wear it, but if they can't, there isn't much they can do."

52,49,"I do not know. You know, I'm not a fan, but it seems like there's nothing I can do about it. It's a hat. It doesn't hurt or bother anyone, but it makes things even more uncomfortable.

49,47,"I think this is a pretty popular topic in the news, because a lot of people think the fact that a guy wearing a mask won't get shot is a sign that the government will do whatever it takes to keep the president alive."
52,49,The CDC isn't responsible for making these hats. It's just a joke that has been snubbed from the public because the article was not interesting or any of the information in it was retaliatory or even something that's completely obfuscating.

49,4,I would be mad if my shit was on the internet for this joke to get posted.
49,8,"I know there are a lot of jokes, but I don't know the actual meaning of it."
49,30,"I don’t know if I would like to see some sort of reversal or reversal. It could be that the president’s hat was worn because he can’t afford a proper helmet, but it's just too much for him to wear a helmet. It’s a joke, but it doesn’t matter. So... I think it’s a good idea to have a hat."
49,47,... I think it's a good idea to have a mask.
52,49,There are 3 reasons why wearing a hat is a joke:
64,49,>“[The school isn't authorized to do it. The school board is required to do it because its a violation of the safety rules.
70,49,"'Don't let these things happen to us. If you don't want it to happen, tell the whole truth.'"
87,49,I'm not a big fan of it. I just want a mask that I can wear to my parents because I know that I can't afford it and I'm not able to make an effort to take care of someone in an emergency.
89,49,People who are not on board with the Obama administration have more than the right to wear a mask because of the lack of respect for them.
97,49,...The President is a racist and doesn't care about it at all.
49,4,"He is an ape, he has no job."
49,8,>The President is a racist and doesn't care about it at all.
49,30,"I'm afraid you just said that ""it's a joke, but it doesn't matter""."
49,47,We're talking about a government incompetence.
52,49,"I'm not sure about the other person, but I do know that they could actually do something with the hat and have the CDC do it. They just think the hat isn't the correct way of doing it."
64,49,There is a fact that the masks have been designed so that they are more sensitive to ultraviolet radiation. This makes them more susceptible to virus infection.
70,49,"People don't say they will, but the fact that it's uncomfortable and not a proper helmet, ""What the fuck is a pathetic, dumb person you are.''"
87,49,Aw fuck the joke. It is an unfortunate thing. I'm so excited to be a part of this.
89,49,I think that the'simple' way to avoid a bad joke is to make it easier to ignore it.
97,49,I'm from Georgia and this is not a joke. It's an absurdly simple story about a man wearing a mask while he's in the White House.
49,4,"He gets no response, and the whole thing makes me question what kind of government he's a member of, what kind of job he's in?"
49,8,I think it's a good idea to wear a mask because you have a huge fanbase.
49,30,I don't think the president should be fired. It just seems like it's an obvious attempt to discredit Obama and the government's stance on the issue. It's basically how the government is making changes. I don't think they should have said anything until after the initial post.
49,47,"I don't get why people are asking. But I think that it's a good idea to have a mask. A person could get shot in the face because the government is not authorized to do it. I know some people get shot but I don't know how the fuck to fix it. I do know the fuck to get shot in the face, but it is not."
52,49,It's a joke. It's not a joke. It's a joke. But it doesn't work.
