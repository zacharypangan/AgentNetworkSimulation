63,56,yes the newest strain is soooooo contagious just bc they have a mask on their hands pics don t mean they re using it
65,56,how does the mask make his breath come out of the back of his head
73,56,oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that
77,56,two tri county health dept board members from douglas county voted against the mask public health order and one did not vote due to affiliation to a school
78,56,how does the mask make his breath come out of the back of his head
79,56,i m not against vacks mandates cuz i don t think i ll catch the cough i already had it i m against them cuz they ruin the economy get people fired and people should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force

56,21,"I'm so in love with the new MX50, a mask that s an awesome protective clothing piece that can be worn on the head while laying on the floor"
56,44,Wearing a mask outside or in your car alone is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
56,54,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
63,56,Then that's what I'm trying to avoid. Wearing a mask on your hands is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
65,56,Wearing a mask helps stop the spread of a virus.
73,56,I think that the people here who are defending the masks are actually actually wearing masks.
77,56,"It was a joke, but not my favorite thing about it at all."
78,56,Wearing a mask helps in stopping the spread of a virus.
79,56,"The guy that s talking to the other guy has a joke about wearing a mask to stop a virus from spreading, he's not even going to say it's a big deal and will never get a shot"
83,56,> If one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops i love coaching

56,21,I'm not saying that the doctors aren't taking the health care industry seriously. They're trying to make money by getting people to wear masks and getting into a health care system. They are just being incompetent.
56,44,I hate to give an opinion but you do have a point.
56,54,The best thing about a mask is the fact that it is not contagious.
63,56,The fact that Maroon is wearing his mask does not mean that they are using it.
65,56,"The issue with wearing a mask isn't the fact that the government is in fact trying to stop the spread of the virus, it's the fact that it's just a temporary mask, and you can't actually wear it anymore because of that."
73,56,Why would anyone want to go to that place?
77,56,"I am a big fan of this kind of thing. You're right it does not help, it's useless and I hate it. Oh, fuck that. Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
78,56,"I love that you're a fan of the one-handed government policy. I think you're being sarcastic, but not that you are."
79,56,"I'm a fucking Republican who wears a mask, and they don't believe in it. They have a lot of good ideas."
83,56,> If one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops i love coaching
89,56,"This is the most appropriate answer - there is a better answer for every one of us - and it's really not a question that comes up a lot in this thread. I think you have to take a deep breath and rethink how you re going to do it, and what the implications are for all of us."
56,21,> What's the best thing about a mask is the fact that it is not contagious. The fact that Maroon is wearing his mask does not mean that they are using it.
56,44,"i'm a big fan of this kind of thing. you're right it does not help, it's useless and I hate it. Oh, fuck that. Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it.

63,56,"The fact that Maroon is wearing his mask does not mean that they are using it. Then wear it like a full face mask and it works wonders when you're dressed and don't have your hands wrapped around you. The whole reason the virus is so sick is because it makes us all think that the person in charge of the virus is just going to get it and that the person that isn't at risk of it is simply not ready for it to develop. I think it's useless, because it's necessary to keep people alive."
65,56,"It seems like in the last couple of years we've been seeing the best, most successful doctors. You have no idea what a jab is. I think they want to prescribe a new medicine that prevents people from having the disease. Wearing a mask doesn't help in stopping the spread of the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
73,56,You're a bad person. Do you really know who's going to have to wear a mask? Do you believe the mask mandates ARE evil?
77,56,In California there is an order to require teachers to wear masks at their school to help prevent the spread of a virus.
78,56,It's not a joke. It's just the ACA.
79,56,"In general, I think it's a lot more akin to ""I'm not against the mandates cuz they ruin the economy get people fired and people should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force""."
83,56,The movie is about a joke about a mask. It's funny that he doesn't even wear a helmet.
89,56,"> ""I don't wear a mask to help spread the virus. Well they are wearing a mask to help spread it. I don't think so. There is also a mask that could help the government stop spread of the virus."
56,21,"Exactly what I thought. It's actually a pretty smart way to have a ""free pass"" to get people to wear masks while driving, and a way to help spread a virus. Obviously, it's a joke and I'd love to see a movie about a virus that was never actually in the public eye."
56,44,Why don't you wear a mask for your safety. This is a mask for people who are sick and sick - just like everyone else is. It's like you're describing a guy who is sick and sick - he has a mask and hasn't tried to change his mask. :P
56,54,"I think there are good ideas about how to change a politician's policy, but I don't think that's the correct answer. If you think the person in charge of the virus is just going to get the virus and that the person that isn't at risk of getting it is simply not ready for it to develop, then you're doing the right thing. It's also possible that in a time when you don't have a political party, you might see some signs of people getting the virus."
63,56,"The only people that have HIV/AIDS who do not wear a mask are people with dementia and depression. It's just a symptom of the disease, and in most cases that does not occur. People who do not have a face mask often do not go to the doctor or to have someone put on their mask."
65,56,">It seems like in the last couple of years we've been seeing the best, most successful doctors. You have no idea what a jab is. I think they want to prescribe a new medicine that prevents people from having the disease. Wearing a mask doesn't help in stopping the spread of the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
73,56,The fact that he 'could' to do it without masks makes it so that he can't have sex with other people. They're just a tool to fight with someone else.
77,56,"Aye, if they can't wear a mask, the school board is going to get mad because it's a huge political issue and the school board can't get mad at the school board."
78,56,The whole thing is going on in my head. What if my friend in high school had to take a picture in front of me and say 'This mask really makes him feel better'? I can't believe the people on r/advices have not come up with something similar in their whole life. Certainly I don't like the government trying to change that and it seems like it will not happen.
79,56,"They are not law, just a way to wring their own hair out."
83,56,"I do not even know why. I am talking about the ""Hey, it's your joke. It's funny that he doesn't even wear a helmet. It's funny that you don't even wear a helmet."""
89,56,"> Do you really like being with the doctor? It would be a good idea if he could make someone who has had a mask go through some sort of antiviral medication. It is the newest strain of the virus, that's not the problem at all. It is not infected, and it has no potential to spread. A tampon is a good way to prevent infection and prevent infection in people with the virus. That's why you wear a mask. Why do you think this would be a good idea? I've got a question."
56,21,"he is making it a joke, not a joke. i mean that he is not the one joking about the government trying to stop a spread of a virus."
56,44,"You're actually describing the government as a tool to prevent someone from having HIV. It's not the government's job to help prevent the disease, it's the government's job to keep people from having HIV. It's a good idea to tell people that wearing a mask to protect yourself, it just isn't practical for everyone. If the government wanted to do something like that, they would have to give the person a license and license, that's why the government could prevent them from having HIV, and I'm not going to make a mistake."
56,54,"I don't think the government needs to wring its own hair out, unless a mask will not help a person."
63,56,"If you've snooped into a CDC meeting and you're not aware what a ""shelter"" is, you probably have the virus."
65,56,I'm a good guy. And I'm not a very good skeptic.
73,56,"> I'm not gonna lie, but I don't think people are thinking this through in the manner they are describing the people that are wearing a mask because they don't think they can be trusted to get it off."
77,56,"The school board voted against it because it's not a school policy. I think this is a good thing, but I'm sorry to hear about the teacher who has to wear a mask at school for the purpose of protecting people."
78,56,"I'm not very good at twitting. I'm a very experienced, irrational person, and I don't think I've ever been in such a situation. But I can say I'm not sure what this guy means. I'm just curious."
79,56,CANNOTANSWER OP I'm going to say the opposite. I'm going to say the opposite. I'm going to say the opposite. I'd be quite surprised if the state could have mandated it without changing it.
83,56,Is this one of those times you can't use a mask to stop the spread of a virus?
89,56,"The problem is that the current government isn't working with people that want to help them, and they aren't taking it seriously. They are trying to use it to prevent health care expenses. It's not just a matter of what their job is."
56,21,This is what I think I need to learn.
56,44,This is an interesting OP's question about how to get the government to help people who are in the hospital and are at risk of getting the virus.
56,54,"This is actually a pretty common issue in the US: The CDC, and the CDC are all not even close to working together in one department. This is a very big concern in many states as well as the people who are in the system. I'd be concerned that a federal program would be so badly badly done that it would be hard for the people in charge to do so, even if they had a 'common sense' if they were going to rename it to something else. I know it's not the gov's job to prevent this problem,"
63,56,A mask is a mask that you put on to prevent a virus that is causing you to become sick.
65,56,People in the US are generally not willing to wear masks to prevent or prevent a virus from spreading to other people. And I don't think there is much of a need for them.
73,56,"I think it's hard to believe that the government is using the term ""fake"" as a security tool. I'm just saying that it's not a sexist or racist statement, it's just that it's not true. I've been reading your comment history for years. You are being serious."
77,56,If the school board has no right to have a private school board vote on whether or not a man can do that.
78,56,> I think that the one-handed government policy that is implementing in the US is to allow people to have a helmet in public. I don't know what to do with this but you're being really sarcastic. There's a lot of information in here that points to that.
79,56,CANNOTANSWER OP
83,56,And if I'm being rude then I'm going to do it. I'm not going to be a joke.
89,56,"I don't want to be in the office, but i want to be with a doctor who I'm very familiar with. My first appointment was with a doctor, and I have not seen anyone have had a fever or infection with a virus. This was a joke."
56,21,I'm going to go down to the CDC and the CDC's safety department and get you a list of all the things the government has to do to stop spread a virus.
56,44,"In other words, it sounds like the state is using that in a very big way. It’s kind of hard to get a general person’s attention, because it isn’t actually the best place for that type of information to be put."
56,54,I'm not trying to be a sarcastic commenter but I don't think it is a good thing or a good idea to put a mask on or on the person who isn't in the health care system. There are some nice comments in this thread based on an article that was originally published in 2004.
63,56,... and they... Are attempting to prevent this spread through masks? That's not a very good point.
65,56,"The government is trying to help the virus spread, but they can't help people that aren't sick. I have a mask on and a go to doctor at work who wants me to see if he can wear it with me. Is this the same reason that doctors aren't allowed to see people who wear masks when I drive or work? Because I know they won't and it's a hazy idea. But the CDC and the federal government are doing some pretty horrifying things for people who don't wear a masks when they don'"
73,56,"You guys have a misunderstanding, aren't they? You should read this."
77,56,">I've had the same experience with the CDC's policy of requiring people not to wear masks at all, regardless of the reasons they were there to prevent people from getting sick. Wearing masks does not help, it's useless and I hate it."
78,56,> So the government was telling the people to go to work and buy the masks?
79,56,I don't think it's a crime in the US to wear a mask outside of a vehicle. Unless the state has created a policy that allows people to wear a mask outside of a vehicle. This is a serious and extremely important issue to have addressed.
83,56,"[Sorry, but I am not a good coach."
89,56,"[History isn't really that important to me. But in the first paragraph I put that you are a conservative, a liberal, and you want to be involved with this government.](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/relationships/doctor-the-huffington-post-trump-shelby-the-huffington-post)"
56,21,> So the government was telling the people to go to work and buy the masks?
56,44,"They are allowing you to take away a part of the security that you are not willing to carry, and allow you to get away with using it."
56,54,"The government is not implementing a policy allowing people to be on the road when they don't have a doctor, but they are attempting to do so."
63,56,This seems like a troll on purpose.
65,56,"I'm going to tell you that in some countries, the best, most successful doctors aren't supposed to get the vaccine but can just keep them on their chests if they have to."
73,56,"A good joke. But if he's going to get a job, why isn't he trying to get a job?"
77,56,"If there is no law that prohibits it, then the public health department would probably be shit about this. The law requiring a teacher to wear a mask is a way to prevent people from getting sick. Unless a state law prevents you from using your a mask, that's just not a good idea."
78,56,I don't like the government trying to change the ACA.
79,56,I don't think any government government is going to be able to stop the spread of a virus without them? I don't think there's anything wrong with wearing a mask unless you're really stupid.
83,56,I hate when people don't wear a mask at the game. Usually my narcissist would be wearing the mask because it's embarrassing. It's probably just a weird haze of smoke.
89,56,"""Hey, aren't you a republican, I'm not the president, but I'm the president, I've always been a big part of the healthcare industry."
56,21,[This is what I think I need to learn.](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/doctor-the-huffington-post-trump-shelby-the-huffington-post)
56,44,I don't like the ACA.
56,54,"I know you're joking but I've said the same thing about my experience with the CDC's policy: ""Hey, aren't you a Republican who wears a mask? They are allowing you to take away a part of the security that you are not willing to carry, and allow you to get away with using it."""
63,56,"I'm a medical professional, and this is definitely the kind of thing that makes people uncomfortable about it....and they... Are attempting to prevent this spread through masks? That's not a very good point."
65,56,"There's a lot of ad hominem at the end of this chapter. It's literally all about the fact that the government is not just trying to stop the spread of a virus. It's just being trying to help people get sick, but the government is being incredibly anti-government. It's just a joke. I'm not going to argue that."
73,56,"[NAME]: ""The mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.> ""Pill that back in the book."", ""'I am very tired of seeing this from the bottom of your post. ""](http://www.nip.com/stn/news_articles.aspx) This has nothing to do with a big government. You can't protect the people from an invasion of safety."
77,56,"I’m not sure if that was a joke, but it was something that should be in the headline."
78,56,">""Was it a joke?"
79,56,Then there is the second part of the joke.
83,56,It's actually a joke in a lot of ways.
89,56,"This is the most appropriate answer - there is a better answer for every one of us - and what the implications are for all of us. [Doctor: I think you have to take a deep breath and rethink how you are going to do it, and what the implications are for all of us. [The last comment here is the one that I was going to say: ""Well, no, I don't like wearing the mask in public. I think it's kind of offensive that they're saying this, but I don't think it's that stupid."
56,21,He's saying that the government is trying to cut people out of the healthcare industry. He's not joking about the government trying to do anything to stop a virus.
56,44,The ACA is a joke. It is not a joke. It is a joke.
56,54,"""I like a mask in the rain, and I don't want to get sick because it's a fad."
63,56,>The whole reason you want to be a schoolteacher is because you're in a school and you know nothing about a school and that you just need a mask for your job. I am sure that I understand people not understanding the problem. Why do you want to work in a school with a CDC?
65,56,No one seems to like the government.
73,56,"The whole thing seems a little sexist, but I don't think it is."
77,56,The problem with masks is that they are intended to prevent a virulent disease and can be a major threat to everyone in the health care system.
78,56,"It's still illegal in the United States. The ACA was passed in 2012, and the Holding the Vaccines Act."
79,56,A lot of people don't really like the jokes and are not too far off from the fact that they're jokes.
83,56,Vaccination is essential to stopping the spread of a virus. It's also an issue with having the public gov't be the healthiest country in the world. This is really ridiculous. And it is.
89,56,"The problem is that the current government isn't working with people that want to help them, and they aren't taking it seriously. They are trying to use it to prevent health care expenses. It's not just a matter of what their job is."""
56,21,You are doing this because you are being a joke. You are being a joke. You are being an idiot. Your opinion is yours. But it is not a joke. It is a joke.
56,44,"You're not a Republican unless you don't wear a mask. And you are NOT a conservative, which is not a joke."
56,54,Vaccination is essential to stopping the spread of a virus.
63,56,"I see a lot of teachers as very religious. And to me the most important thing is to be a good person, not a troll."
65,56,"So you aren't going to tell me how much the government hates the US government? It's been a while since I was in the US, and you said your joke about the CDC is the only real way I know what it's doing."
73,56,The EPA wants to shut down the EPA and stop people from wearing masks.
77,56,"CANNOTANSWER: I think wearing a mask would help stop the spread of a virus. You said that you weren't really sure the doctor was being taken to a doctor for the job of a teacher, not a doctor if you're a psych specialist....I think you're on to something. The idea of a mask isn't to stop people from spreading a virus. What they are proposing is for a school to have a separate'school that does not allow anyone to be inside and outside, thus potentially causing people"
78,56,"ACA passed, not a law."
79,56,The only people who are not against wearing a mask are the people who are wearing a mask and not the people who are using the government as a means of prevention.
83,56,I don't get why people are fucking with the government. They're merely reiterating a situation that the government is trying to control and it's not fair to me.
89,56,"Then you have to explain a little bit to me the meaning of ""The mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
56,21,I'm a conservative and wear a mask when I'm at work. I feel a bit embarrassed about my own behavior. I'm the worst person in the world.
56,44,What's the point of a mask?
56,54,"It's a bad idea for government, but it's the correct one. The CDC has already done this."
63,56,"I mean, it's a joke. That is just a joke."
65,56,"And I'm going to be a better joker and a skeptic than this. I just want to say something. There's a very real difference between a mask and a vaccine, and in the most basic sense, it's not a joke at all."
73,56,The CDC isn't a nutjob. The government has no power in the world.
77,56,"""... The problem with masks is that they are intended to prevent a virulent disease and can be a major threat to everyone in the health care system."""
78,56,"Honestly, I'm not sure. The whole thing is going on in my head. What if my friend in high school had to take a picture in front of me and say 'This mask really makes him feel better'?"
79,56,The first part of the joke is :
83,56,"I like the fact that people are talking about the idea of wearing a mask in a public place is a ridiculous, ridiculous statement. The idea of wearing a mask in a public place is a ridiculous, ridiculous statement."
89,56,"Vaccination is an anti-virus. I've never heard of it and it's the only treatment in my life that doesn't prevent HIV/AIDS. I have also read it and found it very helpful. I want to see it, but I'm afraid there are only a handful of people that can afford it, and haven't seen a patient who has been infected with it. That's something I don't want to know about. I've read this story before but it's nothing that I've ever heard of the government, including a doctor"
56,21,I think people are getting upset and angry about it. I think it's because it has more to do with being anti-virus. They are using it as a way to save lives.
56,44,"Honestly, I'm not going to be able to understand this joke at all. There are only a few people that can afford to see a virus that doesn't live anywhere and a bunch of people who are not comfortable with the idea of one and wear a mask."
56,54,That's exactly how a Democrat can have a very popular 'I'm not a conservative' stance on a government program. That's a big no-no for a conservative
63,56,"I'm not a doctor, I'm not a doctor, I'm a doctor."
65,56,If I were in the US I would have been doing a better job at identifying people with viruses than people who had a vaccine - which could have gotten the disease more quickly if only one of them was sick - without a mask.
73,56,">The entire thing seems a little sexist, but I don't think it is. The whole thing seems a little sexist, but I don't think it is."
77,56,It is a joke. The problem with masks is that they are intended to prevent a virulent disease and can be a major threat to everyone in the health care system.
78,56,> Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. If I'm not mistaken. This is the first time a joke is made like this in the internet: I do not want to know what's going on with my life. Its not a joke.
79,56,"I think it's more about the people who are wearing a mask, that's what everyone else is saying and the one who says it was made in the article"
83,56,a mask is a kind of an oxymoron
89,56,"Vaccination is an anti-virus. It is not an insurance issue. It is a health issue. If you don't want to do it, you can't. If you don't want to do it, you can't. It's a nutjob joke."
56,21,"It's an anti-virus. It is not an insurance issue. It is a health issue. If you don't want to do it, you can't. If you don't want to do it, you can't. If you don't want to do it, you can't."
56,44,"The CDC has done this as well. I'm a big fan. Wearing a mask outside or in your car alone is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.It's a bad idea for government, but it's the correct one. The CDC has already done this. I mean, it's a joke. The CDC has already done this. I mean, it's a joke. The CDC has already done this. I mean, it's a joke."
56,54,"I don't have the money for it, and I don't want to have any of my own money to buy any of those stuff. I think it's a bad idea to put that mask on people who don't have the money."
63,56,"...I would rather be a liar, like the person who was being a troll."
65,56,"I don't know who ''wearing a mask'' in this sub, but it makes me laugh. And I'm not a jerk. ""There is a very real difference between a mask and a vaccine, and in the most basic sense, it's not a joke at all. It's basically just a joke about people saying it's not necessary. Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of the virus."
73,56,The mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
77,56,I'm in California. The schools have a problem with teachers.
78,56,I'd be shocked to hear people start to think that 'the ACA is a joke' is the only one that actually works because it isn't going to be a joke.
79,56,"I just want to put it that way: people are not being an assassin. They are using the government as a means of prevention to prevent the spread of the virus, and the government is not trying to protect the people they're responsible for."

65,56,People are generally not willing to wear masks to prevent or prevent a virus from spreading to other people. Because I know they won't and it's a hazy idea.
73,56,The CDC has no authority to make a rule about vaccination. They can also not regulate it. They use a mask to prevent a vaccine.
77,56,Yes a joke. It's a joke. But I think this is a joke because people feel that the government does not care. People don't care about the issues in their lives.
78,56,"It was passed by a board of education, the CDC, a school board, and a lobbyist. It's not the same thing as the ACA, and a tad too big for a skunk movie. ""I can't stand the fact that he is trying to speak to a bunch of people about this."""
79,56,Is the government a good government? I don't think so.

73,56,a. the world is not like this.

78,56,"I'm so sorry for the confusion, but I just can't imagine a joke going around to tell a different person in another language than I do and why he's trying to use a mask on their friend. This whole thing is hilarious, and I just can't even imagine how many people in the audience actually have to wear a mask. I'm sure this isn't what it sounds like..."
79,56,"I believe you're thinking of the last part, where the government is trying to create a prank."
83,56,">As a former NFL team member, this is pretty much the first time an NFL AMA has ever been more than a commercial."
89,56,"That's the one thing I would rather not know about the government. It doesn't seem to be really a joke to me. You know what's a joke, but it's something I'm familiar with."
56,21,So he's saying that the government is trying to cut people out of the healthcare industry?...
56,44,"I would be a very, very dumb idiot if I could wear a mask outside or in my car alone. It would be like saying if I had the opportunity to walk on my back, i would have been a better person with a mask than a guy who didn't. I would have no idea. If I were a dumbass, I'd just be doing it all to me irl."
56,54,"Vaccination is not an insurance issue. It is not an insurance issue. It is a health issue. If you don't want to do it, you can't."
63,56,"The joke isn't funny, it's a joke. You're a jerk."
65,56,The CDC and the federal government are trying to fix the problem despite the president saying that they want to. They don't want people to be able to avoid the problem but they do want to fix it so that they can keep people at the hospital and see the doctor without masks. They aren't trying to prevent the disease but it isn't the government's problem.
73,56,Its not a joke.
77,56,"They should go after their teachers, they should take them to the school board, and they should move to a private school."

79,56,"''To be fair, I don't think I'm against those laws. You have to have an issue with me to understand why they are there?"

56,54,"Yes, I agree that it is a good idea for people who are at risk. It is also a huge financial loss to the people who are at risk. However, it is not a big deal to the people who aren't in the healthcare industry to get the government to go and get a vaccination. It is a very big concern."
63,56,"The CDC is not trying to cut down on the use of the term ""mask"". They're essentially trying to make the people in the school that work in a sick school wear a mask."

83,56,Vaccination is essential to stopping the spread of a virus. The government is implementing anti-vaccine measures in states where they have mandates to keep people vaccinated. This is all pretty much a question of if a medical professional would eat or chew on the person's head and if it doesn't have legal basis to be there. The anti-vaccine movement is trying to get a shit in the eye of the people involved. Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of a virus.

56,21,That's actually pretty good to say.

65,56,There's a lot of ad hominem at the end of this chapter. It's literally all about the fact that the government is not just trying to stop the spread of a virus. The government is only acting against the government's will. The government is only acting against the government's will. The government is trying to make it illegal because it will cause people to get sick. That's exactly the reason.

83,56,I'm sorry but I think AMAs are funny because they are about the government's policy on health care. The government needs to make a change in the laws. The idea of not wearing a mask is not funny at all.
89,56,"So, in this scenario, the President is wearing a mask to prevent the spread of a virus, essentially, to help the government to prevent that virus from spread to other countries?"
56,21,"I see this from the perspective of an AMA OP was referring to. Essentially, he has said that he thinks the government is acting against the government's will to protect people against disease.

79,56,"I think they should have mandated it before anyone tried to do so. It's only part of the mandate, not the other part."
83,56,So... this is all about the mask.
89,56,It would be a joke if doctors could use it to stop HIV/AIDS outbreaks.
56,21,This is about government health policy. And the 'Jerk' relates to how the government is using the masks as a means to control the spread of viruses in the US and the USSR. It's an obvious example.
56,44,Vaccination is not an insurance issue.

63,56,"I'm in my 40's and I work in a private health clinic & a psych clinic and my teacher tells me I wear a mask to get sick and that the person who is sick has no clue what I'm wearing, and if I do, they don't use it. I'm not wearing a mask."

56,21,"I'm glad they have a new government policy on AIDS vaccination, I think the people who are going to see it have been using it as a joke for years."
56,44,I have a feeling that he is a jerk. I think the joke is that people can’t be in control of their health and have more protection when in danger.
56,54,Those are all jokes to make me a better joker.
63,56,"No, not a joke. Just a joke. You just said that."

77,56,I am a doctor. I like the idea of a mask.
78,56,I've heard that ACA passed by the National Advisory Committee on AIDS Prevention. I can't imagine a country with AIDS vs a government that doesn't want to take advantage of the virus and create a disease that is actually transmitted to humans.
79,56,"I think it's called a joke, because people are going to use it to make fun of the government and to keep you from putting a mask in your vehicle and getting shot, but it's going to be a joke when it gets a lot more popular because people blaming the government"
83,56,CANNOTANSWER: I hate when people don't wear a mask at the game.
89,56,So what's the most appropriate answer for this question?
56,21,I think it is the best way for us to see what we want to see on TV.
56,44,I don't think they have done this.
56,54,What the heck is going on with that one?
63,56,"People with AIDS are more likely to be sick because their mothers or grandmothers aren't putting on a mask. That is a joke. You don't know the full meaning of a joke or how it works, you know the answer is no."
65,56,What's more important is that the government should pay the money they make for the vaccine. This is not the joke. It's the joke.
73,56,It's funny to read people say that there is a big difference between a joke and a joke.
77,56,"CANNOTANSWER, in his most recent post, says he thinks the school's idea of wearing a mask helps prevent the spread of a virus. (I'm a psych specialist, but I've had the same experience with the CDC's policy of requiring people not to wear a mask at their school to prevent people from getting sick. Wearing a mask at their school would help prevent the spread of a virus."
78,56,As a kid in the UK I would take a picture of a face mask and it'd be a pretty funny joke. But if I was in a school band I'd laugh it off at him.
79,56,It's a joke because it's an insult. The president is being sarcastic because he thinks that the government is not going to protect his children.
83,56,I can't be mad at a doctor.
89,56,Vaccination is an anti-virus. It’s not an insurance issue. It’s not an insurance issue. It’s not a serious health issue. It’s not a serious health issue.
56,21,The fact that he is wearing his mask in the first place shows how ignorant and irritated he is about a joke.
56,44,The CDC doesn't have any authority on the law of that country's health care. They aren't doing anything.
56,54,"This is a troll. No, it isn't. This isn't just a joke."
63,56,That's the joke. Those aren't real jokes. That's the joke. That's a joke. That's the joke. That's the joke. That's the joke. That's a joke.
65,56,"he is in a bit of a funk and his name is a jerk. i am actually the guy in a mask, and i am a very good skeptic. and i am not a jerk"
73,56,The only time I read your post is when I get bored.
77,56,"No, but you said the school board was not able to get mad at them because it is a political issue. It's a joke. The problem with masks is that they are intended to prevent a virulent disease and can be a major threat to everyone in the health care system."
78,56,"I'm a man and have seen it all before, but I've found the humor in it is far from over-the-top. It's a big, unintentional joke, and it's incredibly ridiculous that you have to wear a mask in public. And I can't believe that you haven't seen it in a movie or TV. But I can tell you that the real jokes are just not as funny as the real jokes."
79,56,"The whole point of a prank is not to give a shit, but to make a joke."
83,56,"I'm not sure what you're talking about here but, if this were a joke then I would resign and not get back into the game."
89,56,"I think it is the right thing to do, it is the right thing to do. It is the right thing to do. It is the right thing to do. It is the right thing to do. It is the right thing to do. It is the right thing to do. It is the right thing to do."
56,21,What's funny about the mask being a joke is that a number of people who don't want to go to work wear it. Because they think it helps fight AIDS. They don't think it's a serious health issue. That's not a joke.
56,44,"I don't get it, but there's one thing he said to me that I would actually read about the government's policy on preventing people from having a virus."
56,54,"> The whole thing comes down to ""Way to Get a Vaccination and get the ACA repealed?"""
63,56,"The CDC is trying to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS. They do not want to cut down on the use of the word ""mask"". They want the same thing."
65,56,"""If I were in the US I would have been doing a better job at identifying people with viruses than people who had a vaccine."""
73,56,"CANNOTANSWER: ""I'm not gonna lie, but I don't think people are thinking this through in the manner they are describing the people that are wearing a mask because they don't think they can be trusted to get it off."""
77,56,"I've seen a large number of public school administrators wearing masks at public schools, including some in private schools. It is also a joke because the government isn't good at treating the sick. They may not be a psych specialist, but they may be specialists in general psych. They are not doctors, they are specialists in general psych."
78,56,"It's a joke. It's funny, but it's not inherently funny. Neither are the other things mentioned here."
79,56,I like 'no masks'
83,56,"[N.J.A.'s] column on the AMA (retards for comments) has a line titled ""'The AMA's a joke', as in it is about the government's policy on health care."
89,56,"I'd be able to wear the mask to work and not get infected by it, because the vaccine is effective. The CDC needs to put a system in place to take preventative measures and make people feel better."
56,21,"I think you are making a joke, right? What about the idea that we can stop people getting sick by wearing them?"
56,44,"“In other words, it sounds like the government is using that in a very big way.”"
56,54,I don't see a problem with you saying 'I don't think it's a good idea' because it's a joke.
63,56,I want my sons to have AIDS in his hands.
65,56,It's a joke about people who don't know what a mask is. That's just a joke.
73,56,The government is trying to stop people from getting vaccines. The EPA wants to ban the President from wearing a mask.
77,56,"""The problem with masks is that they are intended to prevent a virulent disease and can be a major threat to everyone in the health care system."""
78,56,"I'd like to see a movie with it, I'm not sure what the issue is, but I've never been to that movie and haven't read it all. But I can't really be sure of anything."
79,56,People in this thread are so delusional that they have no reason to care. They're like people who do not know about the CDC. This is a really dumb joke. It's not funny because it's actually a joke.
83,56,"AMA. The Obama administration is not allowed to allow a government-sponsored AMA or medical-led AMAs to be held, but it is allowed by the Obama administration to be held. This is not the only part of the issue, it is the issue of ""health care law"" that is in effect."
89,56,"I've heard several articles about these things, all of which have positive and negative effects on people. I also can't tell you if it's about the government or the economy, but I've heard that people are complaining about the government and it is in the works."
56,21,"Yes, you're a joke. No."
56,44,He's being funny. The President of the US has a good idea. He's clearly an idiot.
56,54,The problem is that the CDC is trying to do nothing about the problem of HIV/AIDS.
63,56,They're trying to create a joke that they're not interested in.
65,56,And it's a joke because the government is not the government's job.
73,56,CANNOTANSWER.
77,56,if they don't want to get involved if they do not want to get involved then they should not go to the school and they should move to a private school
78,56,There is a shit ton of 'no joke' crap that isn't funny if people just don't think it's funny. The point of a one handed policy is to prevent the spread of a virus. The ACA was repealed in 2012 because it was intended to stop the spread of a virus.
79,56,"The whole idea of the CDC is to promote the health care system in the U.S., but there is a lot of misunderstanding about how it works. A doctor should be able to see how effective they are. A fucking prank is a joke."
83,56,The AMA AMA in the U.S. is a joke. The AMA is a joke.
89,56,That's all I have to say.
56,21,"I don't see how people would be surprised that a CDC has no authority to regulate AIDS, but that they would have no authority to regulate HIV/AIDS vaccination."
56,44,"> I sounded a little sore from it. I'm sure a few years of that show won't help. I would love to see a movie with a picture of the man who is a liar in the room, but he seems like a real jerk, because he's so uninterested."
56,54,"This is a good prank. The ACA is about how to prevent the spread of a virus. The CDC, CDC, and other agencies have a different view of public health and are unable to work together to prevent the spread of a virus."
63,56,'Could you possibly be a doctor?'
65,56,It has to do with the fact that the government is acting like a dick. It is a joke because it is an inevitability. It doesn't help stop or prevent the spread of the virus.
73,56,"""My wife said that when she saw what the mask was about, she called me a troll and went on a shit show with her brother. I think this is the right answer."""
77,56,"""I think the idea of wearing a mask at school would help stop the spread of a virus. You said that you weren't really sure the doctor was being taken to a doctor for the job of a teacher, not a doctor if you're a psych specialist....I think you're on to something."""
78,56,I'm not sure how the law would have worked if it had not been repealed. What the president is suing is really irrelevant to the overall situation.
79,56,The idea of a prank is to bring a joke to the conversation.
83,56,"A skunk in a mask is not a respectable threat. A skunk spits in your mouth, it isn’t inhaled or dismantled, it is a “fear” (i.e., not just a nuisance) because it doesn’t allow it in a nutshell. What’s the point in saying they’re trying to solve a virus epidemic that’s happening in the NFL? The “I don’t think it’s legal, but you may be a government employee at some point."
89,56,"You don't like being with a doctor? Not to do it, but to do it."
56,21,"The thing is, the AMA is so misleading. They are making the jokes that haven't been implemented yet that it doesn't matter. The AMA was the first to come to light in my opinion, as opposed to the real story."
56,44,CANNOTANSWER. The ACA is a joke.
56,54,"It’s probably not a joke at all, but it is a big joke about the fact that the government is unable to regulate the HIV/AIDS epidemic in some areas because they are afraid of being caught with the viruses."
63,56,I can assure you that there is a lot of misinformation about the CDC's methods and recommendations for the prevention of HIV/AIDS in the article. The CDC is trying to cut down on use of the word mask.
65,56,"If I am in the US, I would go to the doctor with my dick."
73,56,"Vaccination is a prank. I read it and yelled ""Hey man! Vaccination isn't a joke. I mean, the government is supposed to be trying to impose a law that prohibits the wearing of a mask as an act of retribution or punishing people, not just the people who knowingly do it."
77,56,The schools can't get mad at this.
78,56,"The whole thing is funny. Clearly, you aren't serious and you aren't the one to make it a joke. What the president is suing is really irrelevant to the overall situation."
79,56,"It's a joke, but the real joke is the people who can get themselves to wear a mask in case they have a virus."
83,56,"As a former NFL team member I have to say I think the first part of this is just about people being snarky and not the other part, but there isn't much to say there. But, the idea is that the AMA was a joke in the sense that it was a joke."
89,56,It's one thing for a doctor to get on their nerves. I can't help but see the doctor who is wearing a mask to stop the spread of a virus in public.
56,21,"It’s one thing that is a joke, it’s the one that has some relevance, and a lot of it has zero relevance."
56,44,"The ACA has a lot to do with that. They are ineffective in getting everyone to wear the mask. It is ineffective at keeping people from having HIV. It's a joke that was blown into the ground by the public's attention, and it's not going to be the best tool to stop a virus. It was a prank in the 80's, not just a joke."
56,54,"I know it's not exactly a joke, but there is a lot of ambiguity about what that is, which is why it's a joke. The CDC doesn't want to be in the fight, and the CDC isn't. The ACA has been around since 2004."
63,56,"If I were you, my mother would wear a mask on her face if I were a doctor and I could get a prescription for it if I was a dr. This would be a pretty big deal to me if a doctor is working in a school and my mother had to put on a mask."
65,56,CANNOTANSWER describes the government's ability to help people spread the virus
73,56,CANNOTANSWER is the only person who can understand a government's decision about vaccination. He is not going to know what the CDC is doing at the EPA. He is going to tell you things you don't want to hear.
77,56,A teacher is wearing a mask because he wants a vaccine. Not because he wants a school to be able to have a hat.
78,56,"I'm not saying that the joke is not funny or anything. It's just a joke, and the fact that it isn't the same as the ACA is just a little over the top. The joke is about the government trying to repeal the ACA, not the policy itself."
79,56,What's a joke?
83,56,I’m going to throw a pun here:
89,56,They can go a long way. It's just a joke. They can do anything they want.
56,21,This has been a big discussion for years. The article that is appearing has been pretty good. The doctor who is using this as a joke is actually pretty funny.
56,44,"I wouldn't be upset if I didn't wear a mask, but then I'd just get off my bike and go to the doctor."
56,54,- 'Bad idea'
63,56,Vaccination is a joke because it prevents infections.
65,56,r/MalicePirates
73,56,"As the saying goes, the EPA has no authority to regulate vaccines."
77,56,I'm a doctor who was going to work for a health care system and was not getting sick.
78,56,"If you don't agree that the ACA is a joke, I think you're being over-the-top."
79,56,I don't think people should get sick from the ACA. Is it really a joke?
83,56,So the AMA has some basic underlying truth to it.
89,56,Vaccination is not an insurance issue. It's not an insurance issue. It's not a serious health issue. It's not a serious health issue.
56,21,"The AMA is a joke and it's just a joke. If you don't want to see this, you're being an idiot."
56,44,"The CDC and the government do nothing about it, just don't act in the name of protecting people who don't wear a mask."
56,54,"[The government has done a lot of nonsense in order to keep the HIV epidemic from spreading, I'm going to say it's not a joke. Is it a joke? Then I think I'm being over-the-top. Is it a joke, and the CDC wants to repeal the ACA?"
63,56,"I have HIV and have had a lot of people say that it prevents it from spreading so that I would say that it is the reason people have it because it causes them to feel sick. But it isn't because it makes them sick, but because the way they 'act'does that for you to get sick."
65,56,What's a joke?
73,56,"[The CDC](http://www.nip.com/stn/news_articles.aspx) The whole thing seems a little sexist, but I don’t think it is. The whole thing seems a little sexist, but I don’t think it is."
77,56,"I'm sure that in this instance, people that are not medical professionals, are committing suicide at school and the government would presumably never do something about it."
78,56,a little bit of the jokes -.. 
79,56,"The entire context of this post is ridiculous, but the idea isn't funny. It's actually funny because it's a joke."
83,56,"AMAs are about how the government is trying to help the health care system. It goes on to say that wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of a virus. It's a 'joke' (i.e., an AMA) because of the government's stance on health care."
89,56,"If people were to have the opportunity to go into a government building, I wouldn't feel any more ashamed."
56,21,I think I'd rather die from HIV than not be sick.
56,44,"...and if you wear a mask outside or in your car alone it does not help in stopping the spread of a virus,"
56,54,"""I don't think it's a good idea to put a mask on people who aren't in the healthcare system."
63,56,It’s not a joke. It’s a joke. It’s a joke.
65,56,A joke about the government attempting to save people from getting sick.
73,56,"I was wondering if the EPA would allow the people to wear a mask. I guess they would have to be making fun of him, but that's a very long time ago."

78,56,>I'm not serious and I'm the one to make it a joke. I don't even know what it sounds like. I can't even imagine how many people in the audience actually have to wear a mask in public.
79,56,I like to think a joke is a joke because a joke is a joke.
83,56,"It's kind of sad, but I’d love to see a AMA (AMA/AMA) with the idea of the whole skunks thing being made into a joke."
89,56,Why are people talking about it? They are talking about this one nutjob joke.
56,21,So the doctor was actually wearing a mask for work while he was driving. I think he was telling jokes about what the government is doing to keep people from getting sick.
56,44,This is why there are so many people in the US that don't wear masks when they are sick. And what we need is something about a mask.
56,54,"Yes, that is a joke. You say it is a joke, but you don't mean you think it is a joke."
63,56,"Because the word 'hiv' is 'immuno-preventive' as it's been used for decades, and you can tell by the way the word 'immuno-preventive' doesn't work for the real term ""shelter"", it is the term used to describe a drug used to treat HIV infection. The word ""hiv"" is also a generic name for an infection to prevent from spreading."
65,56,"That was a joke. The government is acting like a dick. It's a joke. 'Why would a doctor not wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus?', 'How does a mask help stop the spread of a virus?', 'What's a joke? 'We aren't trying to stop the spread of a virus."
73,56,"It’s going to seem sexist and racist to me, but I also think it’s infringing on the ability of the federal government to regulate vaccines."
77,56,"Then they need to show that they care about the kids. And if the schools want to be able to tell a joke about it, then they can’t. But then again a good doctor doesn’t have to be in charge of the kids in the school."
78,56,Why do the jokes work? Why does it seem that way?
79,56,> I'm going to say the opposite. I'm going to say the opposite.

56,21,The article states that he's making a joke about the 'Jerk'. It's not a joke.
56,44,"It's a joke. Because it's a joke. If it's an actual joke, it is a joke."
56,54,I think a large percentage of people who don't wear a mask are a bit skeptical.

65,56,I just wanted to mention that the doctor in question is in some kind of bad place.

83,56,CANNOTANSWER : i love coaching however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops i love coaching. i hate wearing a mask at the games..............................
89,56,It’s a joke about the government. It’s not an insurance issue. It’s not a serious health issue.

56,44,"i have been trying to get the CDC to do something about it, but i’m still not sure how to proceed"
56,54,"This is a really fucking good point. It is kind of kind of interesting, but fuck it."
63,56,No. There are some other reasons to believe people who don't have the proper mask are having AIDS.
65,56,>I think the government is acting like a dick. It's a joke because it is an inevitability. It doesn't help stop the spread of the virus.
73,56,This is a joke about the government. It is about the government and it's powers.
77,56,Isn't a joke about the government being a big business?
78,56,"The whole thing is hilarious. Clearly, you aren't serious and you aren't the one to make it a joke."
79,56,"A lot of people voted for it, but are not against the mandates. It's a joke, but they're not against the mandates. It's a joke because it's not a joke."
83,56,"It's like people are going to think ""We don't want to go through this"" and then resign. That's how this sub works."
89,56,"So I think the question is, is a doctor wearing a mask to prevent a virus from spreading?"
56,21,"I'm a big fan of the ACA, but I hate the ACA for various reasons. It is the only thing that hasn't been implemented yet that's not a joke."
56,44,I think the joke is being made by the CDC. It doesn't make any sense.
56,54,"If you like the mask in the rain, and you don't want to get sick because it's a fad. But if you don't want to get sick because it's a fad, then you're doing the right thing."
63,56,"AIDS isn't a joke. AIDS isn't a disease. The CDC isn't putting any effort into trying to stop the spread of it, they're just trying to stop it."
65,56,So r/sandragoa will be in the same situation as r/science?
73,56,"Vaccination is an important part of protecting people from a deadly virus. People have come to the realization that vaccination is not an issue, that it is a legitimate medical necessity. The President has the power to end the epidemic, or to change the course of things, but also to make the vaccines more effective in eliminating the disease."
77,56,"I’m a psych specialist, and a physician. I want to work for a health care system that provides the very best care. We don’t need to do anything about it."
78,56,I have seen the ACA written and said by people who do it a lot in the past and it's one of the worst things ever. I'm an ACA hater and I think I'm going to leave.

56,21,"I think he's saying something like ""I'm a fan of the ACA but I hate the ACA because it's a joke"""
56,44,ACA is a joke.
56,54,"The article is misleading because it is not just a joke, and does not support the ACA."
63,56,The article is pretty witty and it actually addresses the point of the article.
65,56,"The word ""shit"" is the shit that's the most used, sexist, and racist word that a bunch of people used to use to describe the government. The word ""shit"" is a bit sexist because it's not a joke, it's an elitist word for it. The word ""shit"" is also often used to refer to the shit."
73,56,I love the 'NAME' on the list.
77,56,I don't think we're sure about the actual problems with the CDC and the schools in California. It's like the US Supreme Court said a joke is a joke. And he seems to have a pretty solid grasp of how to deal with it.
78,56,"Why would anyone want to see that? I'm sorry, I'm not serious, but it's just that the ACA is a joke. I think the ACA is the only thing that works to prevent AIDS and prevent it from spread. The only way the ACA works is because it doesn't. But, it doesn't really make any sense, and it isn't going to do anything to stop AIDS."
79,56,"> """"[No one is saying this in a racist manner. The Senators told me they are not against the mandates, but for all the time. The Obama Administration and the Department of Homeland Security both have their own policies that they are ineffective at and have a very strong support base."

63,56,People who aren't getting any of these articles and rebutting my previous ones aren't even aware the word is going to be used in a public health facility.
65,56,I'm not a skeptic. I don't understand why the CDC is making a joke that's not even true.
