    "It's really the same reason I'm not a huge fan of it either. I mean, that's all. But it does sound like it was a good thing, but I'm not sure about your specific situation.",
    "The CDC has been pushing the use of the word \"vaccination\" for about a year.",
    "\"I can't stand the fact that he is trying to speak to a bunch of people about this. He is trying to make a lot of money by trying to make money.\"",
    "A mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.TX is a small city with a lot of anti-vaccine trolls and some of them go to festivals. If he has been vaccinated, he won't have to wear a mask at his local sporting events. Vaccination is not a requirement of a government agency. Vaccination is a federal mandate that's not enforceable. I mean, they're trying to make them all out of something they are. I'm not",
    "The government doesn't have the right to mandate a specific type of vaccine for everyone, not just one person. The government is just making excuses.",
    "Is there a government mandate to make it all out of something they are?",
    "Vaccination is a federal mandate, which is an actual requirement to keep people protected, without the ability to provide coverage or get it.",
    "There are two different types of vaccinations in Texas. One is the one that's not mandatory, and the other is a mandate. You can also wear a mask to prevent an infection, but the vaccination isn't required for everyone, unless it's in a person's name. The fact that you have to wear a mask is not the reason to be worried about it, nor are you worried about the lack of a mandate. That's a big red flag.",
    "I'm a fan of TWitchcon.",
    "What is the name of the guy who's trying to make fun of the federal government that nixed the twitchcon?",
    "I don't see the point of having the government make excuses for it being illegal.",
    "Vaccination is a federal mandate. Unless your municipality prohibits it (which I assume is not something the CDC allows), your state has a law banning it. That is the point of vaccinations, and if you're vaccinated you're not required to wear a mask.",
    "They don't have the government's right to make a list of all the things they don't mandate. The fact that it's only illegal in Texas is beyond me.",
    "There is a lot of skepticism around that. I'm sure there are plenty of reasons why people don't have a full vaccine, but I'm not sure if they're all just really stupid.",
    "This is a red flag, because it was a bad deal in Texas. The US has the same kind of policies as most other countries. Vaccination is a federal mandate that can be enforced, but doesn't have a mandate, like in the UK. The only difference is that they were mandated.",
    "I ain't gonna be able to make it here, I'm not. I know it's a red flag, I don't really want to be.",
    "It's illegal for people to be vaccinated without a mask.",
    "I'd be fine with a mask in the UK.",
    ">As a person who's trying to make fun of the federal government that nixed the twitchcon, I'm just saying:",
    "I was at a festival in Austin where I attended. This guy is pretty unfunny to say he's trying to make fun of TWitchCon, a show that people in his area have had a lot of fun attending.",
    "I thought the question came down to what does your govt think that has an effect on the people who wear a mask?",
    "I think the difference is that they want to make the government enforce it.",
    "The whole thing is ridiculous. If you don't know, your sanity and the public's health care needs aren't enough, and you aren't getting the whole \"Ave you heard that?\" remark that's sexist and naive, and I don't get the whole \"I'll not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask\" stuff.",
    "I would like to make this clear to you that he is trying to prevent the spread of the virus by ignoring the actual message of what he is trying to make fun of. That he is trying to prevent the spread of a virus by making fun of the government. Those things are important.",
    "If he wants to push for a mandate, he should. The ACA isn't going to do that. It's going to require more people to go in, so that they can stay on a vaccine.",
    "You're a big fucking fan of the CDC.",
    "Vaccination is illegal because of the fact it isn't mandated in Texas. It's not the ACA that is enforceable.",
    "TIL: The article is about the government enforcing the federal mandate for vaccinations, in addition to a mandate to not have a vaccinated person come to TwitchCon.",
    ">It seems that all the people who have gone to a TV event with a rash are just really stupid. Some people get really stupid. I think there is a reason why people still don't have a full vaccine.",
    "The idea of a full vaccine would be to prevent a rash. What a fucking idiot.",
    ">I think there is a reason why people still don't have a full vaccine.",
    "Vaccination is a federal mandate that can be enforced, but not mandated in Texas.",
    "It seems that the government's trying to force it to be implemented, but they're just not doing it properly.",
    "I think that the whole point of the law is to make people stay on it.",
    "I think you're saying the CDC is trying to make the mandate illegal.",
    "Vaccination is a mandate that is only legally enforceable in Texas. I agree that a vaccinated person does not have to wear a mask at an event because they don't want to be a scumbag. This is a bad idea.",
    "It is illegal for people to wear masks, even though they are actually in Texas. That's not the point. The issue is how to get a vaccinated person to go on their own, and how to convince them that it is a bad idea.",
    "The CDC is an independent entity, so it's not really what they are arguing. The fact that the CDC uses the word \"vaccination\" is more about preventing the spread of the virus.",
    "If there is a reason why it's illegal for a vaccinated person to wear a mask at an event and the government does not enforce it, then you're basically violating the federal mandate. I'd also be quite surprised if the CDC was able to find out who is using the term \"vaccinated\" to refer to all people vaccinated."
