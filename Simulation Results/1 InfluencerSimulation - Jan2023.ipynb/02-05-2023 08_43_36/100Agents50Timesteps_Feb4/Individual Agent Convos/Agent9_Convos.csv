9,4,If you wear a mask you help to stop the spread of a virus.
9,6,No. Not all masks can be applied to humans. They can help prevent diseases.

10,9,"In the meantime I think it is important to stop twitchcon a few days before the vaccine, just so that we can stay safe for everyone regardless of the vaccine. It sounds like it has already started, but I don't know if there is an official state mandate."
14,9,"The government is already having a serious attack on this country, and he is absolutely fucked over by it."
43,9,He was going to have to revert to the mask ordinance to help people. He could've been better off with a mask.
76,9,"This article is a bit of a stretch, but I feel you on this one."

94,9,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus
99,9,"The government doesn't want to make a person's nosebleed' by telling them to suck at a shittiness because it's a public health official who wants to keep his nose open while everyone else is in a rush. Then they get a shittiness. So they're going to want the shittiest person to be around them, not everyone."
101,9,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
9,4,I think a bit of the humor comes from the fact that people on this sub are more likely to use the phrase 'protect other people he only cares about himself' if there's no 'you wear a mask' instead of 'you're wearing one'.
9,6,"Well it's the public health order, i have to say."
10,9,"I was actually asked about this a couple years ago by a friend. It's not the actual vaccine, it's an upcoming one, and it seems to be getting worse. I'm not sure if he likes the vaccine, but I think the gov't is a puppet that the government is, in fact, acting to prevent it."
14,9,I think you've probably heard of that one before. It's one of those things that the military needs to make to protect our country.
43,9,It's ridiculous that the government is campaigning to change the ACA so it's a bad idea to wear a mask to try to combat a virus.
76,9,"It's a nice way to spread the virus if you're sick of it. I think it's necessary. But if you want to spread it, it doesn't work if you are sick of it."

76,9,The article is too lengthy to be a comment.
78,9,"You are an narcissist who just wants to talk to you, and your response is that you want the ACA to help you deal with the epidemic."
94,9,"I'm so sad for people that think that this could be done, it would be indoctrinated into an entirely different religious worldview."
99,9,"I don't get it. It's a real issue, not an excuse. People can be narcissistic. It's a serious illness that needs a doctor to treat it. People need to be well informed about what's going on, especially on their own, and that's why it's the first thing that comes to mind."
101,9,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
9,4,"I don't think you understand why people would wear a mask in an emergency, but in order to do so, you need to be willing to work up the courage to be honest with people."

10,9,">They said the school needs to pay a fee, and the people on the school board should be able to sign a petition."
14,9,That's why you should wear your helmet in a public place to prevent the spread of the disease.
43,9,"I'm from the same county that put on the ACA and I'm a big fan of the ACA. Whether you like it or not, I'm sure it's not the ACA's fault."
76,9,"In the United States, all vaccinating the person is mandatory."
78,9,Is there anything you can do to support the ACA and the ACA itself?
94,9,"They need to have a dialogue with the doctors, not the people they're trying to prevent. It sounds to me like you're saying the government should just get out of the way and not actually do anything about the spread of the virus."

9,6,The government has been doing this since 2003. Hopefully he's a dick.
10,9,">The issue here is that the school is using a false premise about what you see as the 'public health"" issue to justify their actions and/or why they didn't do anything about it."
14,9,They are saying that this is not an effective solution to keep the disease away. That is not a good idea.
43,9,"In my country, the ACA is designed to help prevent the spread of a virus. That's why they're requiring that people don't use the mask."
76,9,"Vaccination is a medical necessity, it entails getting vaccinated."
78,9,"I think you are missing the point. There is an important problem. If you don't like it, don't. If you don't like it, don't."
94,9,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. It's the same as the government that will be able to put a medical device on everyone without them or warning that people will have a virus.

9,6,"I am in the US, and the government doesn't even seem to care what other people think about it."
10,9,"I think we have a great opportunity here, but I know that this doesn't work like this, and this has been around since the 80's. It's important to note that there is a bit of a difference between how people use the masks to stop the spread of the virus, and how people can wear them, and if it's not harmful, it's not going to be the first time. I think it's important to remember that there is a mandate to make this use. But not all the time, and I don't care about it, I don"
14,9,I'm surprised this post came across that way.
43,9,"If the mask isn't required at all, it's a biggie. The government needs to change the laws to prevent that. They can't change the laws and it's not an easy job. I'd rather do it at school than wear a mask at school."
76,9,Is it because the government hasn't been able to get people to go outside of the country? I'm not sure. The government has to be able to get everyone into a safe environment. The government can't make sure everyone is safe.
78,9,"'My son was a doctor for 25 years, and we've always been narcissists to the extent that I am convinced that the ACA is a major disaster.'"
94,9,I feel bad for my parents who would wear a mask to prevent the spread of a virus.
99,9,"So in a case of the public being slapped in the face by the government, I'm going to cite your experience as a example of the government making a joke about a government-sponsored vaccine that was developed in a public health facility."

14,9,I can't imagine how much more disgusting it would be for my wife to be able to live with the news of that.
43,9,It is in the article and not the comments.
76,9,As a doctor I can confirm that it is an effective method of stopping the spread of a virus.
78,9,"[At least](http://www.twitchcon.org/) they are sarcastic. I just don't understand their point in the ACA. It is not an easy thing to do, but it can be done."
94,9,"I'm in Texas. You know, for whatever reason I'm just going to use my doctor's name, because I'm always confused by it. The CDC uses that word for preventing the spread of vaccines. And as you said, I don't know how to understand why a medical device can't help stop people from getting them. Is this a joke or just a joke?"
99,9,"Vaccination is not a medical necessity, it entails getting vaccinated. There's an article from 2006 that says it's not a joke, but a joke. That doesn't mean they shouldn't have a job, because of all the laws about the government's anti-vaccine policy. Is it really the fbi or the CDC that can be blamed for these things and keep them on the side of the people?"
101,9,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
9,4,That is what a mask is. The ACA is a joke. Until we change the laws and make people care for their own health. It is not a joke or just a joke.
9,6,I'm also curious to know what the law is about.
10,9,"It's a joke, and it's not about the end of the world. It's about how the government wants to help with the spread of disease. I think that you may be being more of a sexist and rabid anti-gay nut than a liberal liberal."
14,9,"I'm pretty sure the word ""fake"" is the meaning of the word ""fake."""
43,9,The CDC wants to change the law so they can discourage people from using a mask to try to stop people getting HIV/AIDS. That isn't funny.
76,9,"I think you've already heard the nonsense, so maybe it's a petty joke to use. I'm not a fan of the snarky joke, but I think I'll try to get through it."
78,9,"It's not a joke, it's a stupid thing to think about, and we don't really have any right to be mad about it."
94,9,"People are supposed to do their own research, so there's not much point in making this joke."
99,9,People in this thread are being told to be vaccinated before the vaccine is administered. You might want to consider reading a few other posts.
101,9,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
9,4,The ACA is designed to help stop the spread of the disease.
9,6,"That's a pretty common misconception among people, but one of those is the idea of a ""mask ban""."
10,9,This is one of the most blatant examples of this kind of propaganda in recent times. Unlike the ones that supposedly put masks on children and not get a vaccine. They have to make money from people who aren't doctors to help them.
14,9,"I think you're being very wrong. ""Have you heard of that one before?"" Is there any reason you're a racist?"
43,9,What's up with 'Wearing a mask in my car alone?'
76,9,"I agree, and I think the only point of this is that you know the whole story and are gonna be the first one to say that you want the CDC to do something like this?"
78,9,What is your point? Is it a joke?
94,9,It would also be a joke for people who don't know that a mask is going to stop the spread of a virus.
99,9,"Vaccination is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.It is a very simple thing to bring up, but I think it needs to be a lot more complex. The CDC is basically being an asshole for calling it a joke. They're not trying to be a joke, they're trying to put it in writing as a joke. I think the point of the article is that the government should keep it on the side of people, and tell people that they can't be slapped in the face with"
101,9,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
9,4,I don't know why people wear a mask. I think people wear masks because they look like they're going to do the same to others in the future.
9,6,"In terms of the idea of a ""mask ban"", they are being completely ignorant."
10,9,"It is possible that the CDC is the one who is going to have a vote on whether they want to use the mask, and that they want the school to 'pay the fee' because there is no'real' way to keep the school safe."

14,9,It's a joke.
43,9,"I was surprised at the way the article sounded, though I couldn't agree more about the humor. Especially when they used a phrase like ""I don't think it's racist or skunk joke. I think it's funny. I'm sorry, I'm a teacher."""
76,9,I think the article is just about what the government wants.
78,9,It's a joke because it's a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke.
94,9,"The CDC has a long history of doing such things in the US, and as a result has been doing it in many countries. I've done one as a doctor in the US who a little more than one year and my family didn't like it. This was after my mother, who was a patient in the US and I told her no, but her response to me was like, ""Which is going to happen?"" I don't understand why people have to put on a mask for people who aren't getting it. It's a joke to say"
99,9,I thought the whole point of being an asshole was to make it clear to the people that it's a joke.
101,9,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."

94,9,>I'm a doctor and I wear a mask every day.

43,9,"I’d rather just say something like, 'I’m not a bigot and that’s the reason I’m going to get shut down.'"
76,9,The government is trying to force them to take over.

43,9,"I'm not sure if this is serious, but I just can't imagine what they say about it if it isn't a joke. They just aren't able to put a CDC-approved mask on.
