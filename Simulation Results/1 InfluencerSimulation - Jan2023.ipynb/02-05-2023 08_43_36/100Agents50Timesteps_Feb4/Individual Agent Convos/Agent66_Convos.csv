73,66,oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that
77,66,two tri county health dept board members from douglas county voted against the mask public health order and one did not vote due to affiliation to a school

83,66,i love coaching however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops
91,66,how does the mask make his breath come out of the back of his head
96,66,i love coaching however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops
66,5,"Yes, that is the issue."
66,6,"They would not give you the opportunity to put on the mask. Regardless, wearing it properly would be against the law. It will stop the spread of a virus."
66,27,That's an excellent point about the masks in the fucking govt.
66,34,The mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
66,46,>We must take off our mask and turn ourselves in
66,53,"You've had it already? You've already had it? You don't have to. You can't stop a virus from spreading anywhere, but you can't stop a virus from spreading all over the country. Those are only the last few instances where the flu spreads by force, because they aren't effective."
71,66,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.oh man you should come to georgia it s like people here think wearing a mask gives them covid there s so few oh man you should come to georgia it s like people here think wearing a mask gives them covid there s so few oh man you should come to georgia it s like people here think wearing a mask gives them covid there s so few oh man you should come
72,66,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
73,66,"Yeah, and you don't even have to wear a mask."
77,66,I've always been a huge fan of this sort of thing. I live in D.C. and have been to a lot of health care 'departments' and such in my area. I feel it's a pretty important issue to not support when it's not needed.
79,66,Is there anything wrong with going to the police? Because if you aren't against the law you are not against the police. It's not a police thing.
83,66,"If that's the case, I will be a coach."
91,66,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
96,66,"Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of a virus, it's useless and I hate it."
66,5,"This doesn't seem like a bad idea. You're not being serious, you're just trying to get rid of the system you want, you're being a hypocrite. If you want to be effective, you're fine."
66,6,"The issue is that there is no evidence that wearing a mask causes a viral infection. It's not a virus, it's a mask."
66,27,"I mean, you can be the guy who wears a mask on a hot day to do something, but you can never be a prick for doing it. Hopefully a man of that profession will make a difference. But yeah, this is the stuff we need, and if you can be the one in charge of it, you don't need a mask to take a hot day off."
66,34,"You don't have to go to the police, ya know? Just a thought, because they have a policy that, if you do not get a visa, you have to reapply."
66,46,"Regardless, wearing it properly would be against the law. It will stop the spread of a virus."
66,53,I can tell you from experience the very best way to stop the spread of a virus is to go to the police. I am not against them.
71,66,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
72,66,I'm not sure if trump is ever going to wear a mask.
73,66,"They have to pay for their masks. They will cost them money, and the cost of the mask is based on who wears them, and not who isn't. You don't have to wear a mask to keep them away."
77,66,"My local school board members are in similar situations, but voted against it. They also voted against the government ""responsible"" for bringing the state's education system into effect."
79,66,"> In a few months ago I didn't see a whole lot about it. There are a few things that I like about it, and a few others that I find interesting."
83,66,I'm a football fan and like to read sports and I see this. This is very interesting and fucking funny.
91,66,"The government wants to help people in their own country. It also wants the government to stop the spread of a virus, so we don't have to think about it that way."
96,66,"Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of a virus, it's useless and I hate it."
66,5,"I mean, they don't want to get a government that will help with the epidemic of AIDS. They want to make it so they have to. They don't want to help. And this is what is happening here."
66,6,I am not a fan of the idea of a mask in this context.
66,27,It's called a 'comedian mask' because you don't want to be a bad person. That's why a lot of the anti-virus groups want to shut it down.
66,34,Isn't the policy about the mask a political decision to be a citizen? Is that the point of an issue to be discussed and discussed at the same time?
66,46,This is actually my favorite line of the whole episode and one of the most disturbing.
66,53,I think it is really great the government will make this change and let the people who want it go.
71,66,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
72,66,I hate the way this meme is treated. The mask is too big and scary for people to think of him that way.
73,66,"This is a serious fuck up if it's a joke. I mean, fuck it, this isn't just about what's supposed to be done to stop the spread of a virus. It's about how people think they need to change things. It's that the government is trying to push a thwarted, expensive system that isn't gonna fix it, and what's really bothering people is what people do to stop it."
77,66,They can't vote because they're affiliated to a school. They can't go to a hospital to vote.
79,66,"The ""I'm not against"" part is misleading and misleading. OP, you have to realize that the guy who said it is ""a bit of a remark from a Republican. What is your view on the government mandates?"" Is it something to be distasteful at or against? The first part is pretty interesting. I think your comment was a bit misleading, in that they were not in any way hostile. I'm a republican and I'm not sure what that was. I think your comment was misleading."
83,66,I am not a fan of football but I am a fan of football.
91,66,"I agree with your point of view, but I was trying to think of a solution to the problem. It would be to get a mask that doesn't have to be worn for two months and not the rest of the squad."
96,66,"The ""what if someone has a virus?"" mentality is awful. When you have a virus, you dick it."
66,5,"CANNOTANSWER: A woman who has HIV/abhi/disease has a new face! The idea of a mask is incredibly dangerous and unhelpful to the health care system in America. It's very harmful for the health of women and children, especially if it is in direct contact with cancer, because it creates a real threat and has no impact on the health of women and children. The idea is actually very scary because it's not an anti-virus. It's just a policy. The idea of a mask is a good"
66,6,"There's a lot of misconceptions of 'I don't want to dick it', but that isn't my point."
66,27,"A lot of the anti-virus groups are resentful, like the US, for allowing people to wear masks, but not to fight off the virus - which is a serious issue that needs to be discussed."
66,34,"The government mandates of America, while not really political, are just designed to stop the spread of AIDS."
66,46,"I can see why you think this is a little distasteful, because this whole thing is a really big one. I think I just read something like yours."
66,53,"The ""I'm not against"" part is misleading and misleading. Is the government trying to push a thwarted, expensive system that isn't gonna fix it?"
71,66,"You are reading a story about a guy who had a virus in his head - and they told him he needed a mask, so you sat in his office and he said that his best bet is to use it to try to stop a virus spreading."
72,66,What's this? This is not a joke. It is a joke.
73,66,"You suck at saying things like ""No... no one cares."""
77,66,"Is the government in the US pretty insensitive to women wearing masks. They don't seem to care much about their jobs. Wearing masks does not help in stopping the spread of a virus, it's useless and I hate it."
79,66,I think you're the naive conservative.
83,66,"If you don't have a mask, you can't get into a game."
91,66,A helmet will probably be the answer to the problem. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the US government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
96,66,I have never been to a game where I had to wear a mask and actually didn't.
66,5,I feel like the idea of a mask is a very good idea to make the healthcare system less and less corrupt and unfair. But it also seems like a great idea to work with someone who is being able to get sick.
66,6,You are not a Republican. Are you a republican?
66,27,"I'm a doctor. I've always wanted to be in a medical field but I've never been to a game where I've actually been wearing a mask, and I've never been in a hospital because I felt like I was going to be obliterated by a virus. I've been in hospitals because I'm on a cpa. I don't think I could find a job where a man couldn't go. But if I did, I'd never again, and it's not going to change"
66,34,"A lot of the anti-virus groups are resentful, like the US, for allowing people to wear masks, but not to fight off the virus."
66,46,>You haven't been to a game where I had to wear a mask and actually didn't.
66,53,"> The government mandates of America, while not really political, are just designed to stop the spread of AIDS."
71,66,I want to start by pointing out that it is very common for people to see a hysterical image in a movie that has been a source of a viral fuk in their head...and I think you're being evocative.
72,66,This isn't a joke.
73,66,He wants to protect the public and the rest of us. He is an idiot.
77,66,It's a joke. It's just a joke.
79,66,"""I'm not against the government mandates to protect people."""
83,66,He's been raging about this stuff for over a decade.
91,66,It's the only thing the EPA wants to change. They have to spend all that money on their own stuff.
96,66,Vaccination does not prevent the spread of a virus.
66,5,You're being a hypocrite. Are you even a conservative? You're being a hypocrite.
66,6,"The US has no medical insurance, which is not necessary. In the US, insurance is not a security system. They have no protection. It is the only thing the EPA wants to change. It's not like there are any laws about vaccines in place for that purpose."
66,27,"If you're willing to put up with a lot of stupidity, I think you are the kind of guy who would rather pay a little more attention to health care than a doctor who would rather fight it off? I don't think you are naive, he just doesn't care enough to a point where you are willing to pay an unimaginable amount of attention to the fact that you have a medical background to do something you want to do, even if it's not necessary to do something you don't like. He is a good enough to try"
66,34,The only sane republican is the one who doesn't know anything about vaccines.
66,46,I'm very disappointed with the EPA and the CDC's plans to cut costs of the vaccines and prevent the spread of AIDS.
66,53,"I was really upset when the article stated the Government was trying to protect the people. However, the article claims the government is actually destroying the health care system."
71,66,"I like the word covid. It's like saying I think the people I know in my world are going to be like ""Hey, I'm from Georgia, but I want to make my life better. I'm not from Georgia"" so I have to say that's a good one. I know a bunch of people that hate this but the one with the fucking virus that is, ""I do, and I eat a lot of meat."" My friend said that's a cliched phrase."
72,66,"Yeah, I don't know what your point is. ""This is a joke."" It's more of a question about how people were'shit at the joke because it's a really funny joke, but the joke is not the issue here."
73,66,The people who are trying to stop a virus are the ones making the joke. And that's the problem.
77,66,I've heard this joke before. But you don't have to make it a joke. Your story just explains why the teachers were trying to shut down the school.
79,66,This is not what I'd do.
83,66,"The most obvious example of something like that is the fact that the president has been raging about it for years. It's a weird, horrible reason to put on a mask."
91,66,"He isn't trying to prove anything, it's just trying to say something."
96,66,"The question is, is it necessary for this guy to resign after a year of unprotected play, or can he just keep working and leave a mask on, or will it be a rite of passage? Or is it just something the government has to give him?"
66,5,I'm pretty sure that was a joke. You're being a hypocrite. You're being a hypocrite.
66,6,"I like the fact that I was so upset with the government's anti-vaccine stance that I resisted even calling it a joke because I said something similar and then the CDC said I'm not sure if I'd ever get sick or have a virus in my mouth again, because I'm afraid it's not something I want to do right now. I think the problem with the EPA's approach to preventing a virus is the fact that the government has to spend money on it."
66,27,He can't really wear a mask for a reason.
66,34,You seem very interested in the discussion. It's an interesting and very interesting topic and I can see why the guy is just pointing out a huge deficit and being overreacting. But I find it incredibly sad that some people are denying the existence of a health care system and only trying to enlighten themselves into a culture where a health care system is an important part of life.
66,46,"He's referring to the federal government's efforts to protect the public. He's trying to protect the public, which is absolutely ridiculous."
66,53,"Those are only the last few instances where the flu spreads by force, because they aren't effective. Those are only the last few instances where the virus spreads by force, because they aren't effective."
71,66,We're all in the same boat here.
72,66,"I'm not sure if he will ever wear a mask, but the question is that the people who wear it to stop the spread of hsid will not have a reason to do so."
73,66,"A sexist one would take it as a taint on the people, a sexist one?"
77,66,"Is there a sexism issue? I've been to school districts where the sexism issue is prevalent. I've also seen a large number of public school administrators who did not wear masks or any other masks, including some in private schools. I've even seen the schools of other districts which did not have a physical mask and others that did."
79,66,What about the idea that a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
83,66,Affirmative action is the best thing you can do. It is your choice. I don't think it's the kind of thing that you are going to do. I don't think the idea of 'Making a mask' is in any way the way the government defines it.
91,66,If you're a skunk guy you know what you're talking about.
96,66,"I don't understand why a CDC commentator called them ""assholes."" I don't understand why the FDA would recommend a mask or a helmet."
66,5,You can't deny the existence of a health care system by putting on a mask. You don't say that you can get sick and people who have a virus have a mask.
66,6,"a lot of misconceptions of 'I don't want to dick it', but that isn't my point."", ""I am not a fan of the idea of a mask in this context."
66,27,"I was a doctor. I went to a game where I was wearing a mask and when I got home I felt really bad for the whole thing. I haven't been to a game where I was wearing a mask for years. Then I left because of the NSA, but I didn't have a reason for wearing a mask. And the next year I was fired for being a cpa and going to a party with no responsibilities. I got to do the math and now I have to resign for no reason."
66,34,"IANAL, but when people say ""it's not a vaccine, it's an act of government"" as ""I think we're at a critical mass here and you're not against this"" - they can't even read the words like ""I don't think it's a vaccine, I'm against that."" So..."
66,46,Neither of you haven't been to a game where I had to wear a mask and actually didn't.''
66,53,> 'i've heard this joke before. But you don't have to make it a joke. Your story just explains why the teachers were trying to shut down the school.
71,66,"I'm going to have to say that I'm glad to know that the article was about the US government's failure to tackle HIV. I've been to Georgia many times and have heard all of the comments about Georgians using the ""cliche"" phrase. Honestly, the US government is a pretty terrible place to live. The rest of the world just isn't as clean or healthy as we would like."
72,66,A mask is not required by the ACA. It is supposed to be used in public places.
73,66,This is a joke that the EPA is trying to put on.
77,66,I'm a teacher in a psych program and I understand that wearing a mask is not going to stop people from getting sick.
79,66,RIP. RIP. RIP. RIP. RIP.
83,66,"Yes, we should do that."
91,66,I am very glad they are not in a position to support the NRA.
96,66,"That's what I mean. The NFL, of course, has a medical department. The helmet would help the defense if they couldn't get it on."
66,5,"I have to ask this: Do you have a friend who doesn't have a doctor and can't wear a mask? I mean, you know what the NRA does and what they are doing?"
66,6,What a joke. I feel you.
66,27,"This is an interesting sub, and isn't a wiki article."
66,34,"You don't need a mask to fight AIDS. They need to put it on, and you need a mask to stop the spread. You don't need a mask for AIDS, so you don't even need to be a doctor."
66,46,>I'm very disappointed with the EPA and the CDC's plans to cut costs of the vaccines and prevent the spread of AIDS.
66,53,You can't be a skunk guy and your name is a skunk.
71,66,"I would have been very surprised to learn that there are some people in Georgia who wear masks because of the pity that they are being reported to be a little older than they are. In my country, it can be really tricky to get a man around in the US if his family isn't already doing it. I am not surprised there are people who wear masks because of what they see around them."
72,66,I like that people like this joke when they get a chance to tell their stories. They make an effort to say their real lives aren't going to be good. It's not a joke. It's a joke.
73,66,"This is a joke. The EPA has nothing to do with protecting the people. They are putting on the masks for fear that they will be banned from it, and that this is a joke they are attempting to put on."
77,66,"> I think you're on to something. The idea of a mask isn't to stop people from spreading a virus. What they are proposing is for a school to have a'separate'school that does not allow anyone to be inside and outside, thus potentially causing people to be unwell."
79,66,RIP. RIP. RIP.
83,66,I don't want to be a football coach anymore. I don't want to be a football coach.
91,66,The NRA is just another group of terrorists and they have gotten some very sweeping blowbacks from the media. They may have been the ones who are on top of this.
96,66,"It's not like the government or anything, it's simply saying the virus is not a virus. It's just that there's a virus in the air that spreads fast and there's no other way to protect yourself."
66,5,I haven't seen the article since I was a kid. There's a lot of stuff that is being covered by the NRA that is pretty scary. It's just that it isn't really relevant anymore because people are so scared they can't see anything.
66,6,"I feel bad for you for being a teacher, but I'm happy for you for being able to tell me what I'm actually doing."
66,27,RIP. I do not want to be a doctor.
66,34,"The issue with the masks is not about what they can do, it's about what they can do to help save the people."
66,46,They are not trying to stop people from getting sick. They are trying to prevent the spread of AIDS. They are putting on the masks to prevent the spread of the virus.
66,53,"I'm not sure if there's a specific joke or not, but I can't tell what it means to me. You gotta make sure you have an actual mask. You can wear a mask on a bus if you're not in an ambulance and it's a hazard. Besides, the government is just the government trying to protect the people."
71,66,"The OP has a very illuminating title. I want to say that it is ""the best response"" to this question."
72,66,"Ah, I don't know what your point is. ""This isn't a joke, but the joke is not the issue here."
73,66,"I just wrote a piece that I think should have come up more often: ""This is not a joke, it's a joke. It's a joke. The EPA wants to shut down the EPA and stop people wearing masks."""
77,66,I don't know what it is. I've lived in D.C. for 3 years and I have been to many hospitals. I know it's a joke. But I just think it's a joke. That's what I fucking hate.
79,66,I think it's about the ''Vickings mask '' issue.
83,66,What is the best way you can do if a person has HIV and it's a problem that needs to be dealt with by a doctor? Then go in and get a doctor.
91,66,"I think it was worth looking at, so maybe I can help you."
96,66,I am an NFL player. I am not a government person or official or anything - but I do understand how your comment is making me feel.
66,5,What is the best way to stop people from getting sick?
66,6,"""... but I feel you. I'm happy for you for being able to tell me what I'm actually doing. RIP."
66,27,"The problem with the masks is that the people who are putting on them are not supposed to be in the hospital to be wearing them, and the fact that the people that wear them aren't allowed to see them isn't enough."
66,34,"The issue with the masks is not about what they can do, it's about what they can do to help save the people."
66,46,"I'm not sure who's going to take this seriously. I don't think you will find a source for it, because I am not sure what you think OP was talking about. But there isn't that many of the information that would be worth looking at."
66,53,It's not the best way to stop a virus. It's just that there's a virus in the air that spreads fast and there's no other way to prevent it. The government is just destroying the health care system.
71,66,The US government is a horrible place to live. The rest of the world just isn't as clean or healthy as we would like.'
72,66,"I was trying to be more specific, but the article doesn't address the entire issue."
73,66,">The whole thing seems a little sexist, but I don't think it is. A hivemind. Do you mean 'initiating a big fight' with someone if you're not a doctor?"
77,66,CANNOTANSWER:
79,66,What is the reason for people being sick? You're saying it's about the fact that people are wearing a mask outside of their vehicles.
83,66,The guy is the only one who seems to be in the dark about the gov't. What he is getting at is that it doesn't seem to be the answer.
91,66,You don't say anything about it and it's a bunch of skeptics who disagree.
96,66,I don't really think the game's over. I just think the team should take steps to prevent any possible spread of the virus (and prevent it).
66,5,People are going to be afraid of a virus that is spreading fast.
66,6,"The problem isn't about the mask, the problem is about how the government acts. It's the government that is destroying the health care system."
66,27,That's the whole point of a mask.
66,34,I do not have a doctor in my area. The guy is an EPA fan. You should know his point of view on that.
66,46,Is that you? I'm sick and I'm not getting sick and not sure what's going on here.
66,53,People putting on a mask to protect themselves from the dangers of getting sick are sexist.
71,66,"This is an interesting post about how Georgia is very much a place to live. The people there aren't that far away from the famine. They seem to be going to Georgia in order to find a job. Honestly, I think Georgia is one of the better places to live. I mean it's also a very popular location to live in."
72,66,"I've been at the top of every article on this topic (i.e., I was trying to find something that was actually sexist.) I'm not sure where your comment is coming from."
73,66,"I'm not sure what's going to help, but if you are willing to put your feet in the air and try to blow up the hivemind, you will probably want to be able to read the whole story. That's not what I'm suggesting, and I'm not surprised by it."
77,66,Wearing a mask does not help prevent the spread of a virus.
79,66,"[Hey, I just read your post about the people who aren't against the government mandates. I don't care if you read my entire post. What do you like about them?"
83,66,I think this is a great example of what the NFL wants the most.
91,66,The NRA is a bunch of terrorists. They have gotten some very sweeping blowbacks from the media. They may have been the ones who are on top of this.

66,6,I've read this and I've said that the idea of a mask to stop the spread of a virus is ridiculous. It could have been a bit easier to use a mask for something that isn't a virus in the case of a virus.
66,27,There is a huge issue with masks - how does it prevent a virus from spreading? I was told about that by the NRA when I was still a doctor in college.
66,34,Is that you? I'm sick and I'm not getting sick. Is that you?
66,46,"I don't even care what the guy said, I don't like the hivemind."

71,66,People think people hate people and hate to leave the US. The US government is a horrible place to live. The rest of the world just isn't as clean or healthy as we would like.

66,27,I have read a lot of articles about these and my own personal experiences. I think this is a great example of what the NRA wants the most. The NFL seems to be doing great at preventing the spread of a virus.
66,34,I’m sick and I’m not getting sick.
66,46,There is an article about the NFL on a TIL thread.

83,66,"I don't think there's much going on here, but I'd love to see more of the AMAs on this thread."

96,66,"I'm a new NFL player, and have been in many games where I have never had to wear a mask, but I've had to reschedule to play. I think it's a big problem for me."
66,5,"CANNOTANSWER says the government does NOT want to go to the school where he is sick. He said that while the health care system is largely insensitive to the government, they are trying to make it so that the government doesn't go to work.

66,6,"CANNOTANSWER is talking about the federal government, not the EPA."
66,27,"I'm a psych specialist who went to school for the NSA in the mid 70s. I grew up in a psych community and it was a really bad thing to be able to see a doctor on a daily basis - but I did that because I wanted to. I know that I could not get an Avv, but a med student could make that."
66,34,"The entire ""Mixers of America"" part is a rehash of a generalisation that is often referred to as ""The Government is the Worst""."
66,46,"The NSA has also been in the news with a smear campaign against the NFL. They're being forced to take the word ""protect the public"" and ""speak to the public"" which is a ""no-no-no-no"" on their part."
66,53,It seems that your only alternative to a mask is to continue wearing a mask.

73,66,"This is a joke, I don't think there's a good way to explain it."
77,66,It's a joke because you don't have to make it a joke.
79,66,"Why are you still getting downvoted for pointing out that the government is really trying to create a prank about the skunk problem? What if there's a guy who he likes and you don't go to the police, or someone who gets a prank about him that they aren't in their right mind?"
83,66,It seems to me like this one was made by a 'professional' who was a bit of a nutjob and not necessarily a nutjob.
91,66,"In an AMA, someone says something like ""You are right. Especially when you talk about the NRA, and I do not feel comfortable being involved in it in a way that makes them seem like a terrorist group"". That doesn't sound too bad, because it seems like the guy wants the NRA to stop the spread of a virus and wants the government to stop it from spreading."
96,66,"No. There isn't a specific rule in the NFL that is a crime, and it is one that the CDC and other health care organizations use to make rules to help prevent that from happening."

66,6,I'm not going to get into the specifics but this is the only comment I have been in at the moment.
66,27,It's not a joke.
66,34,"A LOT of people are not against them because of the ""war on drugs"" they make."
66,46,"Those are pretty important questions. You're trying to explain a point of view that people aren't really interested in. It's a joke, but it's not going to solve the problem."
66,53,"There's some harrowing truth about this, it doesn't matter how you read it. The federal government is basically the only organization I know that can work with women to stop an AIDS epidemic, and isn't able to do that if someone gets sick from a virus. There are some issues with this. But the answer is that this AMA is based on the ACA, not a joke, and it's not very logical, it's just an attempt at the NSA to help people to stop the spread of AIDS epidemic."
71,66,I think it's pretty cool' the way they say this. A lot of people in the US are doing the same thing but with a mask.
72,66,You are describing the problem with the AMA.
73,66,I agree with everything you say.
77,66,"I am not saying it's not a joke, but it is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. My job is to protect children, not to protect them from the risks of an infection, so when you say something like this to me it would seem like a joke....and if you're trying to figure out how to do it correctly, that isn't the place to be."","
79,66,Why are there so many different kinds of anti-government humors in the sub?

66,34,Then why aren't you really interested in the discussion. It's an interesting and very interesting topic and I can see why the guy is just pointing out a huge deficit and being overreacting. But I find it incredibly sad that some people are denying the existence of a health care system and only trying to enlighten themselves into a culture where a health care system is an important part of life.
66,46,'Cynical':

77,66,"I think there is an argument for a devolved school board with the mayor, who says the school is in an unsafe area, as a way to promote and make women feel less ill. There is a lot of public support for this, so the board and mayor are very aware of the situation."

83,66,"It's a funny thing to say that it hasn't been done before, and isn't the only thing that has, at all, been done lately."
91,66,There was a bunch of skeptics who disagreed with the article.
96,66,"Vaccination is a crime in most places, but no one can just ""send"" it to the state to make sure it doesn't spread. The government is doing the job it's supposed to do."
66,5,"I don't care if you are sick. I think you're a good friend of a friend, even though you haven't been to a doctor yet. I'm sure you'll be the one to explain that your friend is not going to be able to afford to get sick. I mean, in fact, it's possible that the doctor doesn't want to make you sick at all, so he'll have to get sick."

79,66,I think the problem isn't the mask. It's the fact that the police are involved in protecting people from the virus. The mask is dangerous to the health of people.
83,66,It is all about the mask.
91,66,And there is a lot of misinformation in this thread. The article sounds like it's about a young guy who wants a vaccine and a skunk guy who is trying to make the government look stupid.
96,66,"Vaccination is a crime in most places, but no one can just ""send"" it to the state to make sure it doesn't spread. The government is doing the job it's supposed to do."
66,5,Are you saying the idea of wearing a mask is incredibly dangerous and unhelpful to the health care system? Because there is no way that a single thing like HIV/AIDS will become unprotected.
66,6,"I think the whole point is that the whole point is to make a joke, not just talk to your friends. There's no actual discussion. If you want to talk to your friends, you're too young to talk to them. It's not that you think it's funny, it's about them."
66,27,It's a big deal in the US. We can just have the CDC or an NRA or something.
66,34,This isn't about the mask. It's about what you can do to make a person better. It's not just a way for the government to evade government intervention. It's about how they can be proactive and effective in a disease threatening state that's very important to people.
66,46,It seems like the government is making people sick.
66,53,As the people who are actually sick of this are probably not able to afford the CDC because of their insurance.
71,66,A lot of people in the US are doing the same thing with a mask.
72,66,tbh i've only seen some of the AMAs but i feel like i was trying to get a joke for the first time. alot of the ones were sexist but some were serious sexist.
73,66,EPA is the only EPA that can get rid of people wearing hats. They are doing a good job of getting people to get vaccinated. The CDC is putting out a series of fake news about people having trouble breathing because of the 'complimentary illness' that has spread recently.

66,53,It's about the mask. But the idea of it's a joke is not about the money. It's about a mask that you can buy to stop the spread of a virus.
71,66,i've also read an article about a guy who was diagnosed with HIV and asked about the government's role in helping tackle the virus.
72,66,"The article itself is a joke, despite the fact that it tries to put the entire topic out there."

I'd say we should be using a mask to help stop people from dying of a virus. That's an issue that will come up. The government is doing it to stop the spread of a virus, but I think we need to find a way to stop it."

72,66,The article is misleading and misleading.
73,66,What's the joke about the EPA?
77,66,"The government is trying to help prevent the spread of a virus, the mask is the key. I think the ""Joke"" is a joke."
79,66,"I think the government is just trying to make fun of the government. They're just trying to make fun of the government, as long as they aren't going to make a joke."
83,66,"I'm not a doctor. But I like football a lot. So, why did I do this? I hate the idea of it - I've been coaching for five years and can never go to a game without a mask and I have no idea what to do with it.

91,66,">I think it's worth looking at, so maybe I can help you."
96,66,I've played in the NFL and it's not a big deal. The only thing that matters is being aware of the health issues you're asking about.

66,27,Yes... yes and no.

66,53,"No, that isn't a joke. It is a joke. That is just a joke. It is about the government, its not about the economy."
71,66,I don't know where you got that idea from. It doesn't seem like you have an understanding of the situation.
72,66,The NRA can't sue you for anything.
73,66,"As a non-conformist, I can't even make it to the end of a piece that doesn't really fit the theme."
77,66,CANNOTANSWER and the CDC have a lot in common.
79,66,I don't see how you could be critical of what you said about the idea of a mask.
83,66,It’s all about the mask.
91,66,"The article is misleading, because the article does not mention the EPA and NRA have no authority to change the health care system."
96,66,"The medical staff - narcissists - who are attempting to rip a sick person off of the field for playing the game, are not in favor of doing the job they have been doing."

66,27,What is that? Isn't this just a joke?
66,34,"It's an incredibly easy joke. We're a non-conformist group. It's a bunch of jerks who just don't get the point they're trying to make fun of. That said, I think that people should be able to vote to keep the ACA or whatever in place. I can't even imagine the people who're going to vote."

91,66,I don't understand why people are expressing their dissatisfaction with the government. They are not trying to change the health care system.
96,66,No wonder a lot of doctors aren't going to put up with it.
66,5,CANNOTANSWER: I'm not against vacks mandates cuz they ruin the economy get people fired and people should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force.
66,6,"I'm a bit of a liberal, too, but I feel the entire article in general is wrong in how it's written and it seems like a joke. The whole thing is misleading and I think I'm a bit misinformed."
66,27,"The way they're putting it, the way they're pointing out the issue is silly, they have no authority to do it. They are blaming it on the government and the public. They need to address their own problems and how they are being exploited by the public. The way they're doing it is simply blaming the government."
66,34,>The mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
66,46,That is a joke - a joke. And the government isn't going to do anything.
66,53,"I am a fan of both nascar and the ACA, and I think that's the best way to stop the spread of the AIDS epidemic."
71,66,"It sounded like a story about a guy with a virus and that he was being called 'covid', so he wore a mask to try to make himself look more comfortable with them. I have no idea where you got that idea from. It really does not make any sense at all to me. Honestly I think the US is the worst place in the world to live, because the government isn't doing their job for them."
72,66,"It's a joke, not a real one."
73,66,"Well, i'd rather have people wear hats to help people out, rather than the government."
77,66,I'm glad the school is safe. I just can't stand this joke. The school is in an unsafe place and they are trying to prevent any outbreaks.
79,66,"The first part is actually misleading, in that they were not in any way hostile. They were not using the word 'i'm not against' in any way that would make it look racist, but in that it's basically a joke and you're saying that it's funny because it's funny because it's a joke."
83,66,CANNOTANSWER: I have been trying to figure out what you are talking about. I think this has gotten the wrong tone a little bit. I think this has gotten the wrong tone a little bit.
91,66,CANNOTANSWER: I think the article sounds like it's about a young guy who wants a vaccine and a skunk guy who is trying to make the government look stupid.
96,66,"I'm a physician, and this is not a joke. You're right to be concerned if you're allowed to have your personal health in place, but you aren't being treated by the government. They have the right to decide whether to keep you in the game."
66,5,You could also opine that there are not enough people who would want to go to a doctor without a mask. This is one of the issues that I can see in America.
66,6,I’m a physician and I’m against a lot of vaccines because of the fact that it’s a joke and no one is making fun of the government in the process.
66,27,There is no reason you cannot become a doctor. The mask is an important part of the healthcare system and its intended purpose is to help prevent the spread of viruses. There are no guarantees of preventing the spread of AIDS.
66,34,"I'm not a politician, I am a journalist. I am not even a physician, I am not a doctor."
66,46,You are not against the government being able to help prevent the spread of AIDS. You are not against the government being able to protect the public. You are not against the government being able to stop the spread of AIDS.
66,53,"A bit of all these words sound really funny, e.g. 'I'm not against a mask, I'm not against getting into a medical school, 'I don't care if it was an ad that's about an ad, and I don't want to be in an ad,' 'I don't want to be in an ad that's about the people that will be hurt or sick because of it,'' and 'I'm not an ad, and it doesn't make"
71,66,It's the first time I've ever heard a non-Afghan-English speaker describe an issue with the US government (seems to me that they just take it as they are).
72,66,It's an article. A'research' report says that a half of Hsid patients will die when they wear a mask. People are referring to the issue of the issue of the issue of the mask being a joke that they're telling. People are referring to the issue of the issue of the mask being a joke that they're telling.
73,66,"The joke, that is, the whole joke, is about the EPA, not the EPA, the CDC. And you know it, because if people were to wear a mask and I would have a bad habit of wearing it, I'd be sat down and talk about the joke, because you're not a doctor."

66,5,"I'm a doctor and I can't help myself, and I'm not sure if it's worth the hassle of being a doctor."
66,6,What's the joke? I don't think I would wear one when I'm sick.
66,27,"This isn't a joke. This is an actual issue requiring the US government to avenge their previous policies to save lives. It is a public policy decision, but its purpose is to reduce health disparities between different states and states."
66,34,There are many ways in which I'm not on board with the US's approach.
66,46,"So, as a kid, I remember the jokes of people who were naive to the fact that they thought the government was doing something that didn't work out and that they were naive to the fact that he said no, but that they are being forced to do something that doesn't work out and is not what they want."
66,53,I am not a doctor. And I'm not even a doctor.

If I ever hear of someone being sued, they will ask the question of whether their job is actually worth a second thought if they 'don't want to wear a mask, but 'I don't want to do that'. The question is not whether they are a doctor, they are a psych specialist, they may be a skunk,"" and they have nothing to"
73,66,"The federal government is trying to force the use of vaccines in the US, which is obviously racist."
77,66,"A joke is a joke, a joke is a joke."
79,66,I think you're being a bit of an asshole.
83,66,This isn't what I would think it would be. I would think it's a joke because the people are being sued for it. The ACA is an integral part of the health care reform.
91,66,I don't think it's a really interesting or important question.
96,66,Vaccination is not a crime. It is a crime to have a virus on a player.
66,5,"It's not a joke, but it doesn't sound like a joke."
66,6,Is that the AMA of an ex-NRA member? It was a joke.
66,27,A mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

Besides, the government is just trying to stop the spread of AIDS.'', 'I think it is really great the government"
71,66,I think the problem with the article is that the government is trying to prevent HIV in many countries and putting it up as a barrier. Hopefully this will help.
72,66,Then you're not an idiot unless you actually think it's a joke and that's all that matters.
73,66,"I think it was written by one of the people referring to a joke, not a joke."
77,66,I've never gotten this question about the government's insensitivity toward women. It's just funny.

66,53,People are being sued for the ACA.
71,66,This is a very good article. I think that the US government has the potential to have a major influence on that.

79,66,"I don't see any reason why I think a mask is a joke. But in a sense, I just see how it's a joke. But... I think it's a joke because it's a joke. It's a joke."
83,66,So he's gonna have to go and have a medical exam? That's a joke.
91,66,I know what you mean. There are actually a lot of skeptics out there that don't get the article.
96,66,"Are you in the NFL? I am a medical professional, I want to see the best employer of all time."
66,5,"It's just a joke, just as you're complaining about the anti-government trolls who take away their rights and impose them on people. They're a joke about health care."
66,6,I feel bad for you for being a huge Republican. Are you a liberal? (I feel bad for you for being a huge Republican.) Are you a total hater. The NRA is not the only one that has done this. The people who have not heard of it and are making fun of the government have a lot to say about this. I feel bad for you for being a huge Republican. Are you a conservative? (It's a joke.) I feel bad for you for being a joke.
66,27,A mask is not going to stop a virus if they don't get vaccinated. It's being used as an excuse by health care providers to help prevent a disease from spreading. They can't do anything about it if they don't have the right to care about your health.
66,34,"It is also an inconspicuous joke, as you can see from some of the other commenters."
66,46,The CDC and NRA both have a very specific agenda for the US. They may do something a little more conservative to get in touch with the private health care workers. I think they're not going to be able to stop the spread. The government is probably trying to get in touch with the private health care workers and do nothing.
66,53,So I get the joke: 'I don't like the ACA because it's a joke.'

79,66,"You seem to have a very general view on the skunk issue that's very misleading. The government is using a mask to bring people in, and in some ways is using the government to make fun of the government."

66,27,"So there is a joke about how a mask is an excuse to help prevent the spread of a disease? I'm so sorry, but what a ridiculous, ridiculous idea."
66,34,"I'm not sure if you can figure out how the CDC, EPA and NRA get the message across better, or not, but this one makes me really uncomfortable. Trying to figure out the true meaning of this one could be hard for anyone."
66,46,The NRA and the NSA are trying to prevent the spread of AIDS and they are using a mask to stop the CDC from trying to do a smear campaign against the NFL.

91,66,"I think this was a nice article about the issue, because it essentially implies that wearing a mask is no longer the most effective protection against a virus, or a group of terrorists."
96,66,It is a crime because the government doesn't have the authority to take away the health care they have and keep the players away from the government.
66,5,"""It is a joke because they are trying to make the healthcare system more and less corrupt and unfair. They are trying to make it so that the government doesn't get sick. They are trying to make it so that the government doesn't have to get sick."""
66,6,"The NRA is trying to end the ACA by giving them a ""mask"" to do so that people will not want to wear a mask and to have a virus in their mouth. And because of their ACA, they are getting rid of the mask, making it a joke."
66,27,"Vaccination is not a crime, but it's part of the ACA. It's a joke, it's a joke and it's a joke. But it's the government's job to do it. It is a joke, it's the public's job to do it, it's the government's job to do it."
66,34,"A lot of things I've read about the government in the US, the 'government' and the 'emergency mandate' for healthcare (e.g., not wearing a mask for a long period of time, 'protecting you' from AIDS','suspecting you're sick', 'the ACA', ''I think it's a joke'', 'the fact that the government is trying to make fun of the government'', ''Mike's'' are about in the US"

72,66,I think the AMA is about the government. The mask isn't required by the ACA. It's supposed to be used in public places.
73,66,You have a lot of points that don't have any relevance whatsoever here.
77,66,"It sounds like you're a big fan of the CDC's jokes. You seem to be saying a lot about the issue. ""I think the CDC is a joke, but I think they are going to be too sexist to get a full discussion of a joke about it."""
79,66,"I've been here a few years, and sadly, this isn't a normal joke or joke."
83,66,"No, you can't do the job. I mean, the first part is really a bit of a bs joke."
91,66,"The article is not true. The article doesn't include the EPA or NRA, but it does list the EPA and NRA."
96,66,> You know what the CDC recomends here.
66,5,Vaccination is a joke because it is something you wear to protect yourself.
66,6,The article is in no way a joke.
66,27,"There is a whole list of issues that the NRA is trying to avenge in the US (including the ACA, CDC, CDC and NFL) and is trying to bring a big deal to the US saga. A bunch of nefarious people who think snooping is a joke."
66,34,"""""A lot of the anti-virus groups are resentful, like the US, for allowing people to wear masks, but not to fight off the virus."""
66,46,"I think the article isn't the joke itself, but the fact that the NSA and the NRA are trying to force people to take the vaccines seriously, I'm very surprised."
