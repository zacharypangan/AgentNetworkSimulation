91,75,I didn't read the whole thing. I was gonna say that wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
92,75,I hate karma for that reason. I have been unable to wear a mask and was constantly being attacked by vacks mandates on a regular basis.
94,75,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
98,75,Why do you think this would be a good idea? Its part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
75,17,They have an act of compassion. We are the government that gives us all this. That's right - there's no reason to keep the mask and everything. It's a tactic. We'll just let the people out of this mess.
75,26,What are the risks of wearing a mask in public restrooms?

75,36,"Aye, it's not that crazy to think that we need an emergency to stop the spread of the virus."
75,42,The mask is designed to prevent viral infections. And it's also part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of the virus.
75,54,I am a guy with a mask.

98,75,"That's just not how you describe this tidbit... But I would also describe it as ""in a way, not as a hat. I just wanted to see a scene where a man in a mask tells you that the American people have a hard time breathing because of his mask. No one has said that before, but I can say that they are just as sexist as Donald J. Trump was. Why do you think this would be a good idea?

75,54,Is this a video game or a movie?
79,75,The person is a naive Republican.
85,75,I think he's joking. That's the one movie I've watched with Obama.

75,26,You're probably getting this wrong because it's a satire and a movie
75,27,"Well, in a way, you should have a bit more time for this."
75,29,[Donald J. Trump has an interview with a guy claiming to have a hard time breathing because of his mask.
75,36,A hat is not the only way to stop a virus.
75,42,"The man who was wearing a mask in a movie, ""Totally Safe"", is just a few tad funny."
75,54,The EPA is also the only agency to use this. The one that did it for was in the 1930's.
79,75,"The government has created a lot of new problems. I don't think it's a big deal. We are just there to protect the people. We want to do something about it, not just make sure the government isn't using it. The government has created a lot of new problems."
85,75,Vaccination is not required for everyone unless the person is in an advanced stage of a clinical trial. Isn't that why the state has mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters? Because it makes people less prone to contract and vaccinating.
89,75,"And if the government does that, the person does not get sick unless they wear a mask."
91,75,"Unless you're saying that a mask does not stop the spread of a virus. Whether you're talking about the issue or not, it's definitely not a problem."
92,75,It's time to re-educate your kids.
94,75,I like this one. I think that this is one of the things that should be used.
98,75,"No one has said that before, but I can say that they are just as sexist as Donald J. Trump was. Why do you think this would be a good idea? And the mask in question that is what is calling the whole thing a sex act."
75,17,It doesn't help that we are being punished for our rape. The only thing that stops people from spreading a virus is that we don't get to stop the shit out of them.
75,26,"Yeah, I didn't know the man in the movie was a Republican. It's actually a joke. He's not racist and he's not against a mask..."
75,27,"Well, I'll take a hat off, and it's an emergency!"
75,29,"... is a satire and a movie Well, in a way, you should have a bit more time for this."
75,36,"A lot of people, especially the wealthy ones, have made an attempt to bring this into the mainstream, but there are a lot of things they are really tired of."
75,42,"Honestly, I think this was a good satire of a movie with a man claiming to have a hard time breathing."
75,54,"Well, in a way, you should have a bit more time for this."
79,75,"As an American, I am interested in how this one's interpretation of sex sex is used, but I am not a big fan of these petty jokes about the government's policies. Its a stupid statement, but it is very silly."
85,75,"Vaccination isn't required to protect people from the spread of a virus. It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. The thing about wearing a mask is... you wear it and you eat pizza and you're not healthy? ""...I think the guy is an incompetent idiot who can eat a sandwich for his meal. The trick is to eat more pizza. I do not eat that much pizza. That sounds like a really terrible movie. Apparently,"
89,75,"'Somebody said that the problem is not people wear a mask for their job as a medic, and if there is no need to wear a mask in public, this is going to be the problem.'"
91,75,I think he is referencing the problem. The government can make the issue of people still getting sick. It's a big problem because the EPA and NRA have no authority to do what they want.
92,75,"In the case of Obama, the government should just have a public employee get a job and do whatever it takes to change the rules. The fact that it can't fire someone who doesn't know what the law is to protect the people they can't protect is a very big sign of corruption."
94,75, I like this one. I think that this is one of the things that should be used. People are supposed to think that these masks stop the spread of any type of illness and stop the spread of a virus.
98,75,"As a young woman, I thought it was hilarious. This was a joke on r/womenwhodidntknow."
75,17,... The only way to stop a spread of a virus is to put a mask on - like to wear a hat on people that are not wearing a mask.

75,27,"I agree with all the other comments about the government making the issue, as you have described, untrue, and is an understatement of the facts and culture of the state, so it seems to be a lot of misunderstanding."
75,29,I'm not sure I've read it enough to know for sure if you're referencing the story. But I don't think it's in reference to the movie.

75,42,"""I'm a guy with my mask on when I go in a public restroom, I would be wearing the mask all day..."
75,54,It sounds like the sexist joke is about to become the most accepted joke in American history.

85,75,"The CDC has found that people with an infection are more likely to get sick and will pass a vaccination. In addition, if you have any children, you will have a low prevalence of HIV in your community."
89,75,"Are you a Republican, or a conservative?"
91,75,Is it possible that people are trying to reclaim the issue that is just to prevent or treat a virus on themselves?
92,75,They are just as sexist as Donald J. Trump was. Why do you think this would be a good idea?

75,29,"In this thread I've said a little something similar, ""A lot of people are complaining about the government making the issue of people still getting sick."""
75,36,"I see no problem with the government making this a big issue, but the problem is that the CDC and NRA have no authority to do what they want."
75,42,The fact that you're trying to bring this into the mainstream is hilarious.
75,54,"""The only way to stop a spread of a virus is to put on a mask."""
79,75,The current government is still trying to prevent the spread of the virus and the state is not ok with that.
85,75,A lot of the people involved here are saying... you're not going to be getting infected if you don't know that?
89,75,"It's pretty obvious the majority of people in your thread are Republicans, but it's hard to figure out why that's the case."
91,75,We all have the issues in the world of the disease that we have to deal with.
92,75,People in America should get the EPA to get rid of the federal government. They can fire people who don't comply with the regulations and would be fired for violating them.

75,42,"I am not sure what you're trying to bring into the mainstream in this situation. Isn't there an EPA or a local association, or some other entity in your state that you'd like to work for? I don't see anything wrong with it, at least not at the level of the EPA."
75,54,It is a joke. You are a narcissistic troll and a racist. You don't t make fun of someone or give an excuse.
79,75,"They were all supposed to be about saving the American people, not protecting the government. If the CDC was going to budge in the government policy, we would have to start a new initiative."
85,75,"If you're on the front page of news organizations. I'd go as far as to say that ""The government is essentially trying to stop the spread of the virus. There are many things we do that the US government can't do."" It's been a year. The CDC is requiring that people wear a mask, and not the CDC, to prevent people from getting HIV in their community. The problem is that he's just trying to protect the people, not the fetus itself."
89,75,It's an issue that the government is obligated to address.
91,75,"This is actually quite a nice piece, I found it funny that you say that."
92,75,Obama has never been an EPA employee. But he did get fired a couple months ago because the agency he is now working for is not a part of the government.

75,42,This EPA mask is not really being used as a way to stop HIV. It's designed to protect the people from the fetus. It's not part of the federal government's mandate to prevent the spread of HIV.

75,54,"The President hasn't put on a mask, which isn't a joke. The EPA has also stated that if you wear a mask to be able to prevent the spread of a virus you have to be able to walk through a restaraunt. This isn't a joke, its a joke."
79,75,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.Are you an anti-government/police individual? Are you sure you don't want to see the government making a joke about pranks?
85,75,Vaccination is not required for everybody unless the person is in an advanced stage of a clinical trial.
89,75,There are a few things I don't understand:
91,75,a lot of people are aware of the NRA. The issue in this is not that the NRA is not responsible for the health care system. They have gotten some very sweeping blowbacks from the media. They have gotten some very sweeping blowbacks from the media. They may have been the ones who are on top of this. It's kind of hard to take a serious stand on that. It's not a joke. It's the government who fires people unless they can afford a fucking mask.
92,75,I don't understand why this post is getting downvoted.
94,75,I'm a doctor and I wear a mask.
98,75,Because the idea of a mask is not a joke. You're just going to have to make it a joke to get it to be real.
75,17,"A slew of other political parties are claiming that the ""Obamacare"" is a joke."
75,26,The EPA has also stated that if you wear a mask to be able to prevent the spread of a virus you have to be able to walk through a restaraunt. It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
75,27,"OP, I'm a doctor and I wear a mask."
75,29,My brother has a mask that says you have a hard time breathing because of the mask. I can't get out of it without him.
75,36,"I read the whole article and didn't know much about politics, but there was a lot of shit posted about wearing a mask."

85,75,I think the joke is really just a joke.

91,75,A lot of people are aware of the NRA.
92,75,"This is going to get downvoted by the people who are not really interested in reading this piece. It is not a joke, it is a troll comment."

75,17,"""... The only way to stop a spread of a virus is to put a mask on - like to wear a hat on people that are not wearing a mask. I think it's important to have the public understand the consequences, because the problem lies with how we treat people and how we deal with the effects."""
75,26,I don't care if you're a Republican or not.
75,27,Is there any other way for the government to force people to wear masks?
75,29,"""What do you mean by the idea that the mask is a joke?"""
75,36,I believe it is because it's a joke that the NRA is using a mask to stop people from getting sick and dying. So I think it's a joke that they are using because they think the government is doing something wrong.
75,42,"Then, I'll bet your time that the people that are talking about the man wearing a mask on in that movie are just as racist."

92,75,Those are all serious points.
94,75,"People do not snob out of the fear that the government is not responsible. That's a good thing. I mean, I would think a joke is an opportunity to help someone who's not really a doctor would actually want a vaccine.

98,75,"'Dad it's a joke, it's a hat.'"
75,17,That's a sexist joke. And that's a racist joke. But a sexist joke? It's a joke.
75,26,The EPA was citing a satire about it. If you read the article the EPA is ignoring the EPA. This is a joke.
75,27,A prank. I think it's funny and the EPA is being a dick to the government.
75,29,"I think the article should be noted that there are people who don't even know what it's about - people who say the word ""masked"" isn't very appropriate for the joke and can't read it."

75,26,CANNOTANSWER:

75,29,i'm not sure that this is really funny. but I have been in the world.
75,36,"I've heard the quote before. I hardly know where it comes from, but I think you understand what a mask is about. It is a joke. That you're wearing it when you're sick doesn't mean it's a joke. It doesn't mean you have to wear it if you have an infection."
75,42,Vaccines aren't required by the government. They're called a prank.
75,54,Why do I still wear my mask? Because I don't wear a mask for work. And it's a hat. And no hat!
79,75,CANNOTANSWER.
85,75,"So if you want to make the headlines in a way that demonstrates you want to, you don't need to wear a mask. What if the vaccine wasn't mandated by the government?"

91,75,"It sounds like the article is actually written by the EPA and they are a bunch of terrorists, they're just a bunch of skeptics."
92,75,I just read the piece and the president said that he thought it was a good idea to wear the mask instead of wearing the mask.

75,54,"I think the whole ""I don't think it's a joke"" thing is just a joke, not a joke."
79,75,"A lot of these jokes are based on what people want to hear. So they don't really fit the context of the jokes. The one that's a little weird is ""I thought it was an utter prick"" and ""I don't think anyone is going to be an utter prick."""
85,75,"It's the US government's decision to impose a vaccine on all Americans. It's not the government's choice to tell people ""I'm not a racist"" and isn't going to change much."
89,75,"Well, if you think they are being racist or sexist, it isn't a joke because it a joke based on the government's inaction in the past, which isn't really a good reason, because they are being racist."

75,27,I think the first part of the story is funny and the third part is pretty clear.
75,29,"If people believe that the government is invading people with HIV, then they are going to have an issue in the future. The govt is trying to create a situation where they are more likely to get sick than the people without them. If there is no way to stop it, then if the government is unwilling, they are going to have a problem with the people with HIV."

79,75,I don't think Trump is a racist but it does get pranked over there in the comment section.
85,75,I don't think you are being serious here. The issue is more about the ACA and how it's meant to make people more aware of who they are.
