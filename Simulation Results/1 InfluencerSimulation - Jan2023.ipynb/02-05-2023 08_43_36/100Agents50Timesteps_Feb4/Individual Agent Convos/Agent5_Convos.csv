5,2,Are you sure this is true? Do you know what they are?
5,3,"A lot of this isn't about your hair, it's about your body. You can wear a mask wherever you want. I don't really see why people in churches need to wear a mask in public places, because people in churches can not."
19,5,Having to wear a mask is not enough to prevent a virus from spreading and we are now taking steps to combat this problem.
22,5,i would be pretty pissed if that was your story
25,5,I'm going to make a confession - it's a crime.
35,5,> Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus
36,5,I am a big fan of this but in order to prevent transmission I have to have a mask on.
37,5,CANNOTANSWER  I REMEMBER if we have a mask and wear it with your face it should be hard to get it off if you can not afford it and it is not your job.
50,5,I've heard that wearing a mask to protect your face against viruses does have benefits.
53,5,Its not illegal. Its illegal to wear a mask when you're in public and get fired.
61,5,You've got a twitchcon mask!
66,5,"Yes, that is the issue."
73,5,oh man you should come to georgia it s like people here think wearing a mask gives them covid there s so few
78,5,It's very common for people to wear their masks when they are in public places.
79,5,People are getting so mad at the government - it ruins the economy to be in such a position where they can't control their own destiny
82,5,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
92,5,"They have been a disaster for months, in my opinion, and the people who have gotten fucked by them."
97,5,It is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.Oh man you should come to Georgia it s like people here think wearing a mask gives them covid there s so few
5,2,"People in GA who say a mask doesn't make them sick are also underage and do not deserve to be exposed to a virus, and are getting snorted every day for not wearing a mask to stop it from spreading. I've seen a few people who wore it to see what the church does."
5,3,"I've heard that wearing a mask to protect your face against viruses does have benefits. Its not illegal. Its illegal to wear a mask when you're in public and get fired. You've got a twitchcon mask! Yes, that is the issue."

35,5,They want to teach their young kids how they'll do it in order to prevent spreading the virus.
36,5,"> In Georgia, a majority of the population would be able to go to the CDC without a mask, so if the government has no mandates then people can go to an anti-microbial course. This is a very bad thing."
37,5,> I guess is it is that we can develop something like a helmet that can protect the public from the virus.
50,5,I have no reason to believe this is anything but a joke:
53,5,People are going to get fired. It's the worst. It's not the best. It's the worst. It's the worst. It's the best. It's not the best. It's the worst.
61,5,The fact that this is an upcoming event on the TV news site is very disturbing to me.
66,5,"This doesn't seem like a bad idea. You're not being serious, you're just trying to get rid of the system you want, you're being a hypocrite. If you want to be effective, you're fine."
73,5,I was going to say this to someone.
78,5,I'm not a fan of that one but I think this should be a thing.
79,5,You said you didn't want to keep a mask and got the robbery if you did.
82,5,There's a funny little trick called wearing a mask outside a car when a virus hits your car. The trick is to wear a mask outside your car so that the virus can't get out from behind you.
92,5,[neglected:
97,5,A lot of people seem to think the same thing. He was being totally mean to everyone else.
5,2,"It's a shame he wasn't wearing it. It's an anti-virus campaign, and is a bit cliche."
5,3,> [where are you from](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SimpsonsIdiot/) They want to teach their young kids how they'll do it in order to prevent spreading the virus.
19,5,I don't really agree with what he said. I want to see it. The person who fucked up and blew off their masks has no knowledge of the subject.
22,5,>I would not wear a mask if I didn't need to get vaccinated and I wouldn't be able to stand under my shirt.
25,5,I wore a mask and it stopped me from walking. I could only see what I could find in the public eye.
35,5,i think it's important to realize that this is the government's choice to make.
36,5," (And if you want to go to a senile teenager senile, then you have to take a mask on a young guy. It's not about how you look, it's about how you feel."
37,5,This is a pretty serious topic for a discussion if you were the author. I would suggest reading it as well.
50,5,"That's not an idea, you say that ""wearing a mask to protect your face against viruses does have benefits."""
53,5,This article is actually just some omissions from the US Department of Health and Human Services' recent report on the effectiveness of anti-virus vaccines.
61,5,"Getting to know the people who are being vaccinated is a very basic part of how you protect yourself from viral infection. It doesn't mean there are no right or wrong ways to do this. You should probably look into what the government actually does and learn about it. It is very hard to come up with a policy that will prevent that type of behavior from happening. I mean, I don't know what they do, but it may not be something they can say to you."
66,5,"I mean, they don't want to get a government that will help with the epidemic of AIDS. They want to make it so they have to. They don't want to help. And this is what is happening here."
73,5,It sounds like you're going to get pretty frustrated over a bunch of things I'm not saying. The problem is that the EPA does not actually have a mandate to protect you.
78,5,I've seen a phd student get a mask to stop the spread of a virus. That's pretty much why I get a sarcastic response.
79,5,"ahh, the pricks are stealing my money."
82,5,What is your first experience with wearing a mask?
92,5,"It's called ""snarky asshole"" on the government's part. There is plenty of evidence that it's not going to stop people being fired for saying ""fake"" and ""snarky asshole""."
97,5,"So, a lot of people seem to think the same thing. They aren't in the exact same place."
5,2,"There are a lot of ways to deal with AIDS, especially in a government environment, and I would have a lot more empathy than you."
5,3,>I would not wear a mask if I didn't need to get vaccinated and I wouldn't be able to stand under my shirt. I wore a mask and it stopped me from walking. I could only see what I could find in the public eye.
19,5,"As a nfl player, I threw away my mask about a month ago. I have no idea why anyone would wear a mask. I would be a bit skeptical. I'm a fan of any type of sport, but I don't want to see the guy in the background."
22,5,"I think they're avoiding the whole CDC issue in order to do it. It's just a big part of the overall policy. It's a restraining order to protect you from the spread of HIV, but if you're not vaccinated you should go to the doctor to get it checked."
25,5,He is a good man.
35,5,Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of a virus.
36,5,i am a big fan of this but in order to prevent transmission I have to have a mask on.
37,5,"Yes, I think that's a pretty serious topic for a discussion if you were the author. I would suggest reading it as well."
50,5,"> Because if you don't, you can't tell people. Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
53,5,"The first sentence is misleading. Unless you really want to be an alcoholic, you shouldn't get a chance. The second sentence is a pretty crappy one."
61,5,"It's the same thing that happens to everyone in the US. The masks are good, they prevent the spread of viruses. But you could never have any kind of control over them. You could even wear a mask. It's an example of the same thing that happens to everyone in the US, a lot of people are vaccinated, and they still don't really care about twitchcon. The facts, on the other hand, is a lot less interesting."
66,5,"CANNOTANSWER: A woman who has HIV/abhi/disease has a new face! The idea of a mask is incredibly dangerous and unhelpful to the health care system in America. It's very harmful for the health of women and children, especially if it is in direct contact with cancer, because it creates a real threat and has no impact on the health of women and children. The idea is actually very scary because it's not an anti-virus. It's just a policy. The idea of a mask is a good"
73,5,I believe that a number of people don't realize that a mask is a tool to prevent the spread of a virus. But in my experience a mask is more of a protection than a protective.
78,5,Basically what I am thinking is that a phd student could use the mask to stop the spread of a virus. It's pretty common for people to wear their masks when they're in public places.
79,5,"OP, your comment was misleading and misleading. Is this a remark or a joke?"
82,5,In '08 it is not a crime for a doctor to make a prescription for a helmet when you go for a ride in the UK.
92,5,"The EPA should be ejecting people who can't afford a mask and a scarf, without a crowbar. This is a troll and you're a scumbag."
97,5,The government isn't being a good thing. There is a huge difference in the fact that people think they need to wear a mask in order to stop it.
5,2,They were a part of a program to get people vaccinated. I don't even think you can do that unless you are a fucking NSA or a policing agency. They should have gotten to their fucking heads and cut off their hands and shoulders.
5,3,I'd wear a mask in public places in order to prevent spreading of a virus. Because if I don't need to get vaccinated I wouldn't want to be in public...
19,5,"Isn't that a big deal, but it's not a big deal. If you're just going to be honest with me, I'm going to put up with a few questions like this: I don't see what this is - and why this is not a big deal for you, as a person with a lot of personal responsibility and responsibility, and the fact that you're the one who got the word out that it's a big deal to you that people should be ashamed of their own feelings."
22,5,"Is there anything a CDC could do? I mean, it would have to be pretty hard to be a doctor without being vaccinated."
25,5,"This is a great question, but it's not a very good answer. This is an excellent question. This is the same question that you are describing."
35,5,We have the right to wear a mask.
36,5,"They don't need any more of this. They're making a money off vaccines. It's not a bad thing. You can't do anything if you don't have a mask. If the government is running a government, it's only making money because they don't want to."
37,5,This is very interesting. I would like to know what you think of this film. It makes me feel like this guy is trying to make me feel better.
50,5,"There are dozens of things you can talk about that are not legal, and are often just fucked up. There's even an article that says they could have been used to help prevent people from spreading AIDS."
53,5,"There are some good stories about people in Florida that don't wear masks. I've seen people on a TV show, and I just never wanted them to go to the police when there were outbreaks and I don't want to go to the police when they are actually there. I think you're missing something."
61,5,This isn't about the masks.
66,5,I feel like the idea of a mask is a very good idea to make the healthcare system less and less corrupt and unfair. But it also seems like a great idea to work with someone who is being able to get sick.
73,5,"I don't really think it would be a joke if someone told me to ""go to jail for a lot of fucking drugs."""
78,5,"The government is doing their job, and the mask is part of that."
79,5,"The mask is basically a way to stop the spread of viruses. The people are being allowed to wear it, but if you get shot and don't get shot then you need to wear a mask, you should be able to get a job."
82,5,I'm curious what you think of the fact that wearing a mask outside isn't a crime?
92,5,"> I feel like your response is really very reasonable, which is why you should not be fired, in the first place."
97,5,"I'm so sorry OP, but this isn't a new trend. I'm just saying that I don't want to be as funny as this guy."
5,2,People who have no AIDS are doing what their government tells them.
5,3,"My parents are from the USA, but we don't know what the name of the hospital is."
19,5,"No, the government is just going to make some changes to fix the masks. So to be fair it's not like I'm sarcastic."
22,5,It's been written in this subreddit since January.
25,5,"I'm a liberal who wears a mask all day, but we also have a mandate to protect and protect other people."
35,5,I'm pretty sure the problem is that the government doesn't have the ability to ban black players.
36,5,"The CDC has a policy of not having people wear hats in public health events to prevent spreading of diseases. It was called ""twitchcon"" which is a twitchcon event."
37,5,"i like the part when he got covid but still had events with people and how he won t enforce a statewide mask mandate oh and the part where he cut education funding wow so great. [I would like to know what you think of this film. It makes me feel like this guy is trying to make me feel better. People can say the word ""fun"" in a very strange way but it's not true. You can always be in a public health clinic and have them do a ""shelf-test"" and see if there"
50,5,">In California. We have a class at our school that we have a ""Masked man"" who was wearing a mask at the end of the class for some reason. I think it has to do with the fact that it's not a mask, or a helmet at the end of the class, or in addition to the helmet. I think we should have some sort of program at the school, but that's not the main thing here."
53,5,"We have a lot of health care issues, and if it’s not the most important issue of our lives, people don’t get it, or even think about it. You might as well put the mask on, and just go to the doctor. It’s not the least bit difficult. It’s not like people need a mask if they’re wearing one."
61,5,"""Well, we are the one with the mask, so we just need to make sure everyone is safe. Let me start with a word about this. I don't like the idea of people being ""pooped"" for some reasons."
66,5,You're being a hypocrite. Are you even a conservative? You're being a hypocrite.

78,5,"It’s called ""Assisting the spread of a virus"" as I think it is."
79,5,"I don't think they have a purpose, but they are not mandated to protect people."
82,5,"Yes. If the government is getting their way by wearing a mask in their car, it would be a crime. You're joking, but you can't prove anything. I don't think it's weird to wear a mask in the car, but you can't make sure it's not in the car."
92,5,"I think we should all come here to think about the EPA's attack on public safety, but I'm not gonna argue it."
97,5,I think that we need to start discussing the topic with Donald J. Trump as we speak. He wants the idea to take root in a situation like this and have that take over the media.
5,2,I cant think of anything else in this post. I think it's worth reading a little more to understand what you're going through. It's a bit hard to just read that because a lot of people are saying that they should have an anti-AIDS hat on because it means they can see the difference between a healthy face and a healthy face. Hence the term's point. But we all can be wrong.
5,3,This guy's a dick. He's not even the guy to be laughing at it.
19,5,"I see your point - even though he doesn't think I like what he did, it doesn't make him a politician."
22,5,"They're wearing masks to protect themselves and get themselves tested if they're not vaccinated, and they're trying to stop the spread of a virus."
25,5,"I'm a liberal, and I wear a mask for a living in my town."
35,5,>I believe there's a governmental requirement requiring someone to wear a mask to prevent the spread of a virus. I believe there's a governmental requirement requiring someone to wear a mask to prevent the spread of a virus. There's a very good reason to be afraid of wearing a mask. There's no right or wrong way for them to say what they want. It's the resounding best thing to do now.
36,5,That's a good one.
37,5,">I think it's weird to wear a mask outside, but you don't know how to say that. I don't think it's too bad."

Surely the President is taking the mask down because it is a joke.

66,5,I haven't seen the article since I was a kid. There's a lot of stuff that is being covered by the NRA that is pretty scary. It's just that it isn't really relevant anymore because people are so scared they can't see anything.

78,5,I've gotten some pretty nasty fucking sickness for a while now from using the mask in a bathroom. Mostly to get a lot more sick and ill than a few.
79,5,Are you sure that it's true?
82,5,"""We have a mask in the car and we want a mask in the car because it's a crime to wear it to prevent any possible spread of a disease. We can't prevent a virus from spread outside of your car"""
92,5,"I'm a Democrat, and I've seen that it is a joke on the radio. I think it is silly. The truth is that there are people who don't understand the EPA. It isn't their fault. They haven't proven this."
97,5,The White House is going to make a huge effort to stop the spread of HIV in the US.
5,2,">The problem isn't the masks. The issue is that you need to tell the government to ""wear them."""
5,3,Vaccines are still a law in the U.S. It's illegal to wear a mask in public places if you're going to be getting a diagnosis and then trying to get you out of a coma. This is pretty funny.
19,5,You've got the right to be concerned if the problem becomes worse when people do it. It's going to be a petty shit show.
22,5,They have to show up on a public bus to get their first vaccination. Vaccines are actually about preventable diseases but they are not about prevention and prevention of infectious diseases.
25,5,"People that believe that the mask is an effective prevention tool aren't going to learn to accept a solution, but if they think it's not enough they probably will accept the CDC and will refuse to recognize it as a valid means of treatment. It might be a sexist tactic. But that's what it's supposed to be referring to: how people who wear a mask are actually treated in the US, not the other way around."
35,5,I'm just saying that it sounds a bit hysterical.
36,5,"There's a reason we do not have this policy, but the fact that it's only a joke is a good reason."
37,5,You're so overreacting to what they're doing. They're not in the right. The CIA is doing something that's evil.
50,5,You don't think it's a joke?
53,5,Isn't the ACA really an issue?
61,5,"What you're describing is a public health agency in Georgia. Not a government agency, but a health agency that was formed by a government employee to fight the spread of a virus. This guy is saying that they are not allowed to use their public health agency to kill people who don't get vaccines. The NRA is being sabotaged by a government, they are trying to discredit the government, and they are doing it because it doesn't sabotages the health care system."
66,5,What is the best way to stop people from getting sick?
73,5,"This is why the EPA is being used to protect people, and in some ways, they are using the phrase ""fake"" as a security tool."
78,5,It's not like the government hasn't implemented a law since 2012.
79,5,"I’m sure you have no idea what that is, but I think that a mask is a good idea. The problem with having a mask in the vehicle is people are clinging to their racist agenda. Those are the very facts that are funny. The problem with the government is that it’s a great way to prevent the spread of the disease."
82,5,"The US has a lot of skunk laws, not to mention the entire thing is unconstitutional."
92,5,"Well, I'm in a different world. So I'm saying, ""I am not against vacks mandates cuz they ruin the economy get people fired and people should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force"" [[Katy Perry]:][[Neglected:][Neglected:][Neglected:](https://www.facebook.com/support/neglected/Paty Perry)"
97,5,"My brother is a racist and I know this because of the jokes he makes. He’s also in the news, so it’s pretty cool that he’s wearing The only reason that a hat screams racist is because the person is making racist jokes and isn’t actually aware of them, and therefore doesn’t really care about the joke."
5,2,We're doing this by pointing out a repercussion of a racist joke on Facebook. You've obviously made a bad comment in the past.
5,3,"Yeah, I am not in the US, but the NRA is being used to help prevent the spread of HIV."
19,5,"There's a video at r/politics where the guys who actually wear a mask are able to explain to you the nature of their identity and what they've been doing in that video, which explains why they don't wear their masks. So, just think about it."
22,5,My wife wears a mask to get tested and they both say they are dangerous.
25,5,"oh, you got it."
35,5,"The joke is, ""...I don’t have a job for EPA. I was diagnosed with HIV, and I know how serious it is to have that shit in your face every single day!"""
36,5,"Basically all this stuff about hats, and all the people who say that they should be wearing masks to prevent spreading of a virus isn't funny."
37,5,"'I think it's weird to wear a mask outside, but you don't know how to say that. I don't think it's too bad."""
50,5,I would also like to see if the story in the entire AMA was really 'why'' but it's probably the one you're getting at here.
53,5,"I have to ask: Why would they have allowed such a thing in place? I've worked at a bank and have had many jobs. They wouldn't have let me wear them when I was in the office and the fact that I was wearing a mask when I was in a coma makes me question why people would wear them at all? I just don't know what they want to do if I get in trouble or if I want to do it at work and get a job at the hospital, but at least I'll be able to go to a doctor"
61,5,">I don't like the idea of people being ""pooped"" for some reasons."
66,5,People are going to be afraid of a virus that is spreading fast.
73,5,What was the name of this movie?
78,5,"If you're trying to explain it to your school, use the term ""hip"" instead of ""hip."""
79,5,"That's a bit of a shit and a bit of a joke, but its a good one."
82,5,[Woods of the Future]. he is using the EPA for the skunk problem.
92,5,"I'm not against vacks mandates, I think they are a mistake and you're not wrong. They have been a disaster for months. They've been a disaster for months."
97,5,I see a lot of jokes about hats in some videos about hats.
5,2,"I had an AMA and my thoughts were blown off to the best of my knowledge. I've gotten to the point where I'm trying to make fun of this and don't know who I'm talking to. But I think it's kind of a nice thing to have. I have to have a laugh about the masks, and I just want to be able to see it for the first time. I don't like it."
5,3,[Simpsons Idiot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SimpsonsIdiot/) They want to teach their young kids how they'll do it in order to prevent spreading of the virus.
19,5,I see how it's not as bad as it sounds. I'm not the shill of anything.
22,5,You don't know a lot about the CDC. Your comment about a government that will be able to help you prevent HIV/AIDS is offensive. You know that joke that you don't like?
25,5,This is one of the greatest things to happen in life.
35,5,"CANNOTANSWER, CANNOTANSWER, CANNOTANSWER, CANNOTANSWER, CANNOTANSWER, CANNOTANSWER, CANNOTANSWER, CANNOTANSWER, CANNOTANSWER, CANNOTANSWER, CANNOTANSWER, CANNOTANSWER, CANNOTANSWER, CANNOTANSWER, CANNOTANSWER, CANNOTANSWER, CANNOTANSWER, CANNOTANSWER,"
36,5,"If you're not a doctor, you could try the same thing."
37,5,A few things to get back.
50,5,The AMA is very interesting. Then what's the major issue?
53,5,Vaccination is still a law in the US. It's illegal to wear a mask if you are going to be getting a diagnosis and then trying to get you out of a coma. This is a joke.
61,5,It's hard to know which group has a mandate or what is the specific reason for it. And I'd bet that's the reason he didn't wear one himself.
66,5,"In the US, we can't use any medical devices to protect us against the spread of HIV/A. It's a public health issue."
73,5,So you're referencing the joke a few times:
78,5,It's funny to see a guy wearing a mask to help a man with an infectious disease get one. And there's some interesting facts about this.
79,5,r/narcissists is very good at making jokes.
82,5,"You've gone to a fair bit of a disadvantage with this one, but I don't think it's an issue."
92,5,I've read about the effect of the Obama administration on sexism and unemployment.
97,5,"I want to put up with this, I don't want to be in this position, and I don't want to be in a situation where everyone on the Internet can be at fault. I want to be at fault with the media, because this a movie is in fact a good way to take it down."
5,2,The Obama administration is not supposed to help people.
5,3,I don't understand what it means to have a mask if you don't like it
19,5,"""Having to wear a mask is not enough to prevent a virus from spreading and we are now taking steps to combat this problem."""
22,5,I'm not sure who said that?
25,5,I'd rather have it written in a sarcastic or racist voice. It's the first edgy joke I've ever heard.
35,5,I think the article is a little too sarcastic.
36,5,"As a Florida resident who has never heard of the EPA, this is one of the best examples of a racist conspiracy of the United States and I can honestly say that it's not funny or even funny to say that they're doing this to stop the spread of a disease."
37,5,The AMA is written by Donald Trump and is one of a bunch of good ones.
50,5,"> I would do something like this at the end of class, and then get it back together with the professors and get some free syringes of your own. I would have a horrible nightmare about being exposed to a lot of diseases in my day."
53,5,It’s a joke.
61,5,You're a very knowledgeable person. I'm a huge fan of the US government. It's an awesome place to be.
66,5,There is nothing to be denied. Neither the NRA nor the NRA support any or all of those things.
73,5,"It's not a joke, it's just a joke. What is the point of a joke?"
78,5,"CANNOTANSWER: The only thing I don't understand is the fact that the government is attempting to make them wear a mask in public, and they are not allowed to do so is really telling. The problem isn't the mask. In general, if the problem isn't the mask. In general, if the problem isn't the mask. If the problem isn't the mask. In general, if the problem isn't the mask. If the problem isn't a mask, then I will be happy that this joke is"
79,5,"IANAL, but I m fairly certain the joke is about how the government is trying to prevent the spread of a virus. They are not the government. It's an anti-government/police thing."
82,5,"I'm a huge fan of the EPA's'reckless' policies, but I am an EPA official and I'm very passionate about the issues involved. I can't stand the 'free' rules that the EPA and the CDC provide."
92,5,I do not understand why anyone thinks that wearing a mask is necessary to keep people safe. It is not.
97,5,"Is there a real reason that they are talking about hats? I’m not really sure, but that hats are very racist."
5,2,CANNOTANSWER:
5,3,"I don't know what's the point of this joke, but I do want to know what's the point of this? The point is to explain why there's a reason to go to church and not do anything hat-style."
19,5,"""We're going to try to work to fix the masks that've already been worn for over a decade without requiring a new one."""
22,5,Vaccines are not a thing. They aren't just about preventable diseases. They are not about prevention and prevention of infectious diseases.
25,5,> I don't think it's a joke.
35,5,I don't know why I'm getting downvoted. Especially because I'm in a shitstorm about these things.
36,5,"I hate to be a hypocrite but this is true. The only time I've ever seen the President wearing a mask was as a joke. I'm a hat and face mask. And even if I'm not a racist, I think it's all I ever read about it."
37,5,"This is not a joke or a joke. The problem isn't the mask. It's a joke, and it's not a crime."
50,5,"I'm a doctor. I'm going to get tested to see if there are any other people who aren't immune to the same illness, so I don't really know if it will work but I am pretty sure I have some health problems"
53,5,"This subreddit is not racist, and if you are not careful, you will come across this AMA as a joke. The actual article is in no way relevant to the topic, and if you are not familiar with it, you should read the post."
61,5,This is my favorite post from my childhood.
66,5,"CANNOTANSWER says the government does NOT want to go to the school where he is sick. He said that while the health care system is largely insensitive to the government, they are trying to make it so that the government doesn't go to work. The school board hasn't had a chance to fix it. It's not really a joke."
73,5,"This is a very good joke, that has very little to do with the actual reality that it has in it."
78,5,You said that they were attempting to stop the spread of a virus.
79,5,I can think of a few examples of racist jokes on here.
82,5,"""I'm a huge fan of the EPA and I'm very passionate about the issues involved. I think it's a good idea to fire people because of the TAX. It says that wearing a mask outside is not a crime. It says that it is a crime to smoke if you do it in public without your permission."
92,5,"I don't think this is a joke, but people do."
97,5,"This is a good point of view, and a great point to have, so I can give my opinion on what is not racist. The question is how much is the hat joke, and how much is the joke?"
5,2,I'm a doctor and i'm a doctor. So why wouldn't you wear a mask when you can't see the difference between a healthy face and an infectious disease?
5,3,Apparently the EPA is trying to keep it in compliance with the new rules and regulations for the health care system.
19,5,"Then I'm not so sure why you think he was trying to be funny, but he is."
22,5,"Vaccines are not about preventable diseases. They aren't just about preventable diseases, but prevention and prevention of infectious diseases."
25,5,"> ""The problem is that they are supposed to prevent people from being vaccinated. My husband, a doctor and I will continue to wear a mask when he's sick, and I'm so embarrassed I don't even know how it worked."
35,5,The article has the answer of 'Hannah'. It's funny and it doesn't really matter.
36,5,"That's not a joke, it's an official idea. EPA is not doing anything to stop the spread of a virus."
37,5,"I think the message is really good, but there is no right reason to change it."
50,5,- The AMA is a joke.
53,5,"""I think the issue is that the AMA is about what the people need to do to prevent this problem."
61,5,This is a great post.

73,5,I’m so confused about the whole skunk problem.
78,5,"I am confused by the ten points of it, but I am not a fan of the ACA. It isn't the ACA."
79,5,That's what you're saying. What is this.
82,5,"We have a lot of skunk laws, not to mention the entire thing is unconstitutional."
92,5,The EPA has done everything it could to stop the spread of a virus.
97,5,"It's a joke. But they are not being racist. A big, evil one!"
5,2,"I have seen many cases of skunks on the internet, especially in my state. I'm very sorry about that, I just think I'm not comfortable with this."
5,3,I am not a big fan of the ACA. It isn't the ACA.
19,5,Why don't people watch a movie about a virus while wearing a mask?
22,5,"The CDC is basically making it more of a sarcastic prank than anything else: 'Vaccines are not preventable diseases. They are not about prevention and prevention of infectious diseases'. I would tell them that 'A lot of people don't understand that it's a joke. You are making a joke about the government, not the government, but the government itself. ''"
25,5,I’d rather a little bit of a sarcastic or racist voice. It’s the first edgy joke I’ve ever heard.
35,5,If we go to the CDC we'll have to pay for it and tell people to stop going. Basically we can't do it until we're armed and on the field.
36,5,"I thought Trump was trying to make a joke about people wearing masks, not that he was in charge of them, and that he was sarcastic about it."
37,5,I've been in the AMA with my dad and he said he is a big fan of the government. And then I saw it with the news. He said it would be a shame if he wouldn't wear it.
50,5,"The whole ""We're not going to be able to provide health protection. But I haven't talked to the CDC about a mask."
53,5,The AMA is not about what the people need to do to prevent this problem. This isn't about whether it's good or bad. This is about whether it's a joke.
61,5,Those are just the jokes that people like to see. They aren't pranks.
66,5,It's not like the article is about the nfl's problems because its a joke.
73,5,We can only hope that the people that are complaining that the mask isn’t helping prevent an epidemic of skunks are aware that they’re being used to kill people who dread to travel.
78,5,ACA is a joke. It isn't the ACA. It isn't a joke.
79,5,There's a lot of racism in this sub. I'm not a skunk but I like to read.
82,5,I think it's a good idea to fire people because of the TAX. It's a crime to wear a mask outside a public place.
92,5,"If someone was wearing a mask in public, they would be ejected, scumbags. The EPA should never take responsibility."
97,5,"I have to say, as much as I can hate the guy who is the one who is wearing the mask, I'm not so sure that hats are racist and they're not just because he's a joke, they're because he doesn't want to do this. I think people like saying things like ""Hack, you're not a joke"" and ""I don't like being a joke""."

22,5,"We can't give you a 'joke' about the CDC, we can just not take a joke about it."
25,5,I don't think a person could get a better job without a mask and a lot of them wouldn't get vaccinated.
35,5,I'm getting downvoted because I don't like the fact that people can be so stupidly ignorant about the truth.
36,5,"They are only doing the right thing. The EPA, who are doing the right thing, is the people that are the ones that are causing the virus."
37,5,I don't think people really like a good movie involving a mask. People who say a mask is a joke in a very strange way and have to go through a lot of trouble to get a good one. I don't understand why people think it is a joke or a joke.
50,5,"The story you are getting at is in my opinion a bad one. Its a joke, and the joke is a joke."

I'm sure you'll be the one to explain that your friend is not going to be able to afford to get sick. I mean, in fact, it's possible that the doctor doesn't want to make you sick at all, so he'll have to get sick."
73,5,"This is not a joke. It's just that a lot of people think the idea of a mask in the US to protect a sick guy is ridiculous and they're pointing out that they're racist, not a joke."

61,5,"It seems very strange that you are the only one who has ever commented on the AMA, and you did so in the guise of pointing out a flaw in the government policy, rather than pointing out what is happening - a sham! That's probably why there is an AMA about people getting vaccinated with a mask - not just the government."
66,5,Are you saying the idea of wearing a mask is incredibly dangerous and unhelpful to the health care system? Because there is no way that a single thing like HIV/AIDS will become unprotected.
73,5,A lot of people have been complaining about how the people who have the mask are dreadful of skunks dread to travel and are also in danger of being attacked by the government.
78,5,"It's been like this for a week now, so I don't know what to do."
79,5,i can see why you'd be a little embarrassed if a politician is making fun of the government with a prank
82,5,You're being a delusional asshole.
92,5,That's a really good line.
97,5,"So you said it to say, ""Oh, I'm not the only one who finds it a joke."""
5,2,"I agree that it's a joke, but I think you are being a delusional asshole."
5,3,They are trying to make it harder to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS. And it isn't a joke.
19,5,"I'm a little skeptical because I don't know how to answer questions like ""...I think the only reason it isn't effective is because it prevents an infectious disease from spreading."""
22,5,The joke is an absolute lie.
25,5,I don't have the energy to take a deep breath in this. I think this is what you're doing.
35,5,It's a slang term because there are some people who say that there's no problem with a mask but they aren't afraid of it.

61,5,"It seems very strange that you are the only one who has ever commented on the AMA, and you did so in the guise of pointing out a flaw in the government policy, rather than pointing out what is happening - a sham! That's probably why there is an AMA about people getting vaccinated with a mask. The article goes on to state that the EPA and NRA have no authority to change the health care system."
66,5,I think the problem is that the NRA's only goal is to get rid of the government.
73,5,"The thing is, they're trying to make fun of a joke about the Obama administration because they think that hats are funny. I just want to add the most important part: he's a troll, but I also can't find anything to talk about."
78,5,"My name is David and I am from Houston, Texas."

53,5,"Honestly, the ACA is one of the most controversial laws that have been passed - 'I'm not gonna put on a mask because I'm not getting a diagnosis '- i just don't know what it means."
61,5,The AMA seems like a bit of a dick thing.
66,5,"I think it's a great idea. But a mask might be more practical. And even if you're not going to use it as a tool, the mask will not do much more than annoy people with your health. I'd say we should be using a mask to help stop people from dying of a virus. That's an issue that will come up. The government is doing it to stop the spread of a virus, but I think we need to find a way to stop it."
73,5,"We do need to put the mask on in a different light, to protect people in areas of need."
78,5,CANNOTANSWER is the only one in Texas who has ever called on a joke to a non-existent joke.
79,5,Vaccination is a joke and not a prank.
82,5,"That is a really nice title, I love this one."
92,5,"I don’t think 'Assault on the health of the people?’, 'This is an excellent response to the ""We need to talk to the people to understand this.'"
97,5,"He's not racist. The joke is about the president not being racist, the president is the racist and not racist."
5,2,They also want to teach their kids how to use a mask - in this case - to stop people from dying of AIDS. This is a joke.
5,3,I would not wear a mask in public places if I don't need to get vaccinated and I wouldn't be able to stand under my shirt.
19,5,"It's not the way to deal with a racist, sexist, and racist joke. It's the way to deal with a racist, sexist, sexist, racist, and racist joke."
22,5,"[the [people] (https://en.reddit.com/r/academics/en-landlord_historians/academics/2013/01/06/cvc_landlord_historians_for_a_) have posted a list of racist racist comments since 2009, that include:"
25,5,Vaccination isn't legal in Texas and it is not on the ballot. It's not a joke.
35,5,Is this what he's going to say?
36,5,"I think most of these people are just as much into the idea of the president and the idea of a government that would protect their constituents by not doing anything. The idea of a public health organization is a joke, but it's not a joke. It's a joke, but not funny."
37,5,I think you're overreacting.
50,5,I don't care if the joke isn't a joke. It is a joke.
53,5,This isn't a joke.
61,5,I think people in this sub should have a go at these.
66,5,It's just a joke. It's funny. It's funny. It's funny.
73,5,"The problem isn't the masks. The issue is that the government is using the phrase ""fake"" as a security tool."
78,5,CANNOTANSWER is the only one in Texas who has ever called on a joke to a non-existent joke.
79,5,Why isn't the Government a joke?
82,5,"I'm so glad the NRA is skunk free now, because I just got stung by a skunk"
92,5,"It's in the article of ""Teeners of the White House and Women's Rights, Part II. A conversation about the issues of the EPA, Part III"" on [[http://www.cpss.gov/rep-insights/](http://www.reddit.com/rep-insight/e/insights/Peter-Perry)]."
97,5,"In other words, this is a really, really funny joke. It's a very short one, and it's pretty much on the whole oblivious and non-ideological."
5,2,I think you're just overreacting. You just blew off a good one.
5,3,It sounds like the president is going to put a mask on the church building and then use it on a lot of people. Not just the people who wear the mask.
19,5,"I’m a very large fan of the ACA, and don’t mind me asking why people wear a mask."
22,5,Vaccines are about preventable diseases. They are not about prevention and prevention of infectious diseases.
25,5,''The problem is that they are supposed to prevent people from being vaccinated.
35,5,The ACA is not a joke.
36,5,"I'm a Republican, and the president of Florida is wearing a mask is pretty cool."
37,5,I am not saying a hat is a joke. I am saying that it is a joke to tell people to wear one. It's an example of something not happening right now.
50,5,Are you not a racist?
53,5,What about people who are wearing masks? There are two kinds of vaccines.
61,5,It ain't the government.
66,5,"Yes, the idea is to stop people from getting sick and not go to school."
73,5,It's an issue that the CDC is trying to smear in the US.
78,5,>The ACA is not a joke. The government is just skunks. The entire point of the ACA is to prevent people from getting sick. People have an issue with how much they subsidize their kids' schooling.
79,5,"I don't know how that's possible, but the reason the CDC has so much hate is because of the CDC, who is actually anti-vaccine and is promoting the ACA."
82,5,"People are supposed to be able to say how many times they've been hit by the skunks in their car. When they're on their car in a car, they say the same thing, but without a skunk in their car."
92,5,"The entire article says the ""cannot understand why anyone thinks that wearing a mask is necessary to keep people safe."" It also notes how they haven't been doing it in the past, and have been the source of this confusion for a while. It doesn't mean that the government should change its policy in order to stop a viral attack."
97,5,"If I were the president, and I was in the White House, I'd say you're a racist."
5,2,"""They don't pay for people to wear a mask to stop people from getting sick and getting AIDS. The mask is part of the legislation used to prevent AIDS."""
5,3,>They want to teach their young kids how they'll do it in order to prevent spreading of the virus.
19,5,"The mask is a part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.If a skeptic didn't have a mask, then the government wouldn't have been able to pass it onto him. It's not like people who want to wear the mask to save themselves is the same as being infected while wearing the mask."
22,5,"I think it's funny for the government to help stop the spread of HIV/AIDS, but for the public to see and act on it."
25,5,And then the EPA makes it more interesting.
35,5,"""The president is saying that if he doesn't wear a mask, he shouldn't be treated as racist."""
36,5,I don't even know what your post is about.
37,5,The title makes it seem like the article is directed at [Measuring_a_Fun.](https://www.nra.org/issues/disgraces) which is referencing the first part of the article. OP is not a skunk.
50,5,"""I don't care if the joke isn't a joke. It is a joke."""
53,5,... I read in the top 5 comments that I don't think it's a joke. I don't think it's a joke.
61,5,">It seems very strange that you are the only one who has ever commented on the AMA, and you did so in the guise of pointing out a flaw in the government policy, rather than pointing out what is happening - a sham! That's probably why there is an AMA about people getting vaccinated with a mask."

82,5,"I mean, if it was me, I would be stung. I can't remember my name. But I've seen lots of stories like this on the internet. It's hard for me to believe they would fire people for a skunk."
92,5,I don't think it's a good idea to call you a troll if you're in a group of people in general.
97,5,I love people like this. I like to wear masks but I want to go and wear hats.
5,2,"""It seems very strange that you are the only one who has ever commented on the article, and you did so in the guise of pointing out a flaw in the government policy, rather than pointing out what is happening - a sham!"""
5,3,A hat is a mask to protect your face. It is a part of the legislation used to prevent the spread of HIV. It is illegal to wear a mask in public places if you're going to be getting a diagnosis and then trying to get you out of a coma. This is pretty funny.
19,5,I think the joke of wearing a mask is a joke. The President is trying to stop the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask will prevent the spread of a virus and help prevent it from spreading.
22,5,Isn't it a joke?
25,5,The way this is thrown around here is that a mask is a joke. There is no such thing as a'serious' joke. I think it's silly and not really a joke.
35,5,">A lot of people don't know how to say it, so they just don't know what it's called. I think they're going to try to do something about it to try to control public health."""
36,5,EPA in particular. That's a joke.

50,5,"CANNOTANSWER: ""The best way to deal with it is to get the CDC out of the program."""
53,5,"I am also against the idea of not having a mask, and am against the idea that people have been able to do this before. I would not be surprised if a new health care system was created for the people in a precinct. I think that is not something that should be ignored or brushed aside. Especially if the government decided to re-enact it so the people in the country who are ill aren't treated."

66,5,[Reflection](http://www.nra.org/resources/resources/resources/Reflection/Resources/Resources-Application.pdf)
73,5,A lot of people think a mask to prevent the spread of a virus is ridiculous and they're pointing out that they're racist.
78,5,"The only way you can make people understand this is with a sarcastic response like ""It's pretty common for people to wear their masks when they're in public places.""."
79,5,The Obama administration is being criticized for their stance on vaccines.
82,5,"People are supposed to be able to say how many times they've been hit by the skunks in their car. When they're on their car in a public place, they might be answering ""No, it's not a crime if it's not a crime to smoke in public""."
92,5,"I am not a Democrat. I think it is the real EPA that slanders the government, not the person doing it."
97,5,"In my view, being a racist isn't an appropriate way to use the word joke."
5,2,"I don't think there's much truth to what you describe. I've had friends who have been sick and aren't able to understand things they don't understand. That said, I don't know what he's talking about."
5,3,... but I think that's a lot of fun.
19,5,A joke isn't a joke. It's a joke. A joke is a joke. The fact that a skeptic had a mask is a joke.
22,5,"My wife and I wear a mask to get tested when we go to the clinic to get tested. So if it was me, I'd be wearing a mask because of it. I'm not going to get the vaccine unless I'm sick. And the government is not allowed to make any decisions."
25,5,I wore a mask during a class trip on our tour that had no ties to any other government employees and was greeted by a man wearing a mask despite knowing that they had a sick dog.
35,5,"The president needs to be fired, a lot of the issues are a bit silly. This is more of a satire than an actual prank. The whole thing is a joke."
36,5,They were sarcastic about it.
37,5,I think there are a lot of people in the world who would be comfortable with wearing a hat and a mask.
50,5,This is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
53,5,Is it really a joke. I'm also against the idea of not having a mask. The problem with a mask is that it makes you look like the one on your helmet. And the reason people don't know what a mask is is because the person is a doctor.
61,5,I feel like the AMA's are very disturbing. The point is that the AMA isn't about vaccination. The issue is that the AMA is about getting people vaccinated with a mask. It's also about how they are using the government to annoy people. It's a cliche.
66,5,It's just a joke. It's funny. It's funny. It's funny. It's funny. It's funny. It's funny. It's funny.
73,5,RIP as a racist. They are trying to smear the EPA as a threat to the US.
78,5,The ACA is a joke. It is a joke.
79,5,"The real problem with the government is that it’s not a joke, it’s just a joke."
82,5,the EPA is going to fire the guy in a lot of trouble for a lot of reasons.
92,5,">[I feel like your response is really very reasonable, which is why you should not be fired, in the first place."
97,5,"OP says a lot of things, and doesn't even say a lot of words that are racist."
5,2,[Personally speaking] [Personally speaking] [Statutory] (http://www.www.statutory.org/Statutory_Pages/troll_reports/denial/index.html)
5,3,The wording here is so sexist and insulting to the US. I'm not a big fan of the ACA. It's a joke.
19,5,CANNOTANSWER](http://www.twitchingcon.org/) Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
22,5,The president is trying to be racist. The AMA is just a joke.
25,5,Vaccination is not legal in Texas. They’re not even legally legal anymore. They’re not going to help combat the spread.
35,5,"I read the article from my phone, and I was so confused by it that I had to put a hat on my forehead."
36,5,It is a joke because he is trying to get people sick and they don't have enough money to keep them vaccinated.
37,5,Why not just say this one...
50,5,I'm a CDC trained acologist and we know this. I know this is a joke. It is a joke.
53,5,This isn't a joke. It's a joke.
61,5,"“It is not a joke. The AMA is about getting people vaccinated with a mask. It’s also about how they are using the government to annoy people. It’s a cliche. It’s a joke.

66,5,"That's a fucking joke. It makes me want to get sick, because I'm a good friend."
73,5,I think they are trying to convince people that the EPA should be able to regulate vaccinations for people who are allergic to the virus.
78,5,They want to ban the use of the mask in public places.
79,5,I don't think a mask is going to be the joke. A mask is a means to prevent the spread of viruses. A mask is a way to stop it. It's illegal to wear a mask outside of a public place.
82,5,>They're suing the EPA and the CDC for the skunk problem.

97,5,"... The first two are pretty funny. The op said a lot of blatantly offensive statements from the movie. Those are all blatantly offensive statements, and there is more to it than that. If he was a President he could have a hat and the virus would not be present."

5,3,>[Personally speaking] [Statutory] (http://www.www.statutory.org/Statutory_Pages/troll_reports/denial/index.html) The wording here is so sexist and insulting to the US. I'm not a big fan of the ACA. It's a joke.
19,5,I'd be a little skeptical. I'm a fan of the nfl. I don't want to see the guy in the background.
22,5,The AMA is a prank. And is not a joke.
25,5,"If the guy wearing a mask wears a mask all day and is sick, they have no reason to be scared. But it's a joke."

36,5,"""This isn't a joke. There are some incredibly cynical people out there. I think the joke is about the media trying to keep the government from enabling people to be sick, but the idea of the government trying to help them by making people wear masks is the one that is really causing some serious pain. It's not an ad hominem. I think it's a joke because they are trying to force the government to do more."" ""I believe it is because it's a joke."
37,5,"No one is going to listen to that, just a few other comments on the subject."
50,5,"I mean, the problem is not the money, but the fact that it prevents the spread of AIDS. The question is if it is worth the investment. It's not a joke to me."
53,5,i'd be pretty stoked if it was in this AMA
61,5,You can get a tampon and a mask from the anti-abuse groups on twitch. Then you get a mask and a mask for your face. Then you get an ad for them on twitch.
66,5,It sounds like the guy is a hypocrite.
73,5,I think the EPA should get an immunity warning for people who are allergic to a viral disease that is being passed through our lungs.
78,5,"""Making the ACA works:"
79,5,"Vaccination is a joke, but not a joke."
82,5,What are the current laws for getting a new mask on the road?
92,5,"No. I've got a good theory, but I'd be more offended if I were fired for a joke. I have a good theory, but I'm not sure how it works."
97,5,The only funny thing about hats is how many people are in the White House who don't wear hats.
5,2,A friend I have told told me that wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
5,3,They want to teach their kids how to do it in order to prevent spreading of the virus.
19,5,So what you want is the first question that comes to mind here.
22,5,Are you kidding? You're saying the AMA is a joke.
25,5,"""They're trying to convince the government to do the same. It's a joke."""
35,5,"You've gotten the impression that there is no law to make your spouse wear a mask, to stop their daughter from getting sick of a virus. I just think this makes a lot of sense that there is a law requiring parents to wear a mask. It doesn't seem as if any of it is the right way to do things if a woman does something that's against the law. Is there a law requiring doctors to wear a mask? No? No. That is the case if the man did something that does not prevent people from getting sick"
36,5,They're making money off a joke.
37,5,"I gotta say, the one time I was on the AMA, I wasn't comfortable. I was just like 'I think it's weird to wear a mask outside'."
50,5,The CDC is trying to cut the TAX on this because the AMA is just making fun of things that are not legal.
53,5,This is a joke. The jokes aren't even funny. The jokes are a joke.
61,5,I think the problem is that the government is not responsible for everyone. I think it's important to find some time to educate yourself before you put your life on the line.
66,5,CANNOTANSWER: I'm not against vacks mandates cuz they ruin the economy get people fired and people should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force.
73,5,I'd like to add that to the ad. It's not a joke. I read the article and I think that the whole thing is a joke.
78,5,"No wonder so many people can't think outside of this context. You're right, the ACA has always been ineffective, and we're going to continue the ACA if there's no change."
79,5,Yes. It's a joke.
82,5,I am not a lawyer. You should contact your attorney.
92,5,">I think the whole thing is a joke because people are saying something ridiculous, not only because they are putting the public at risk and making them look bad."
97,5,"People in this thread, in their 30s, are very ignorant and unconvinced."
5,2,"""I don't think you can do that unless you are a fucking NSA or policing agency. They should have gotten to their fucking heads and cut off their hands and shoulders."","
5,3,If you think that's a joke then a law like this isn't a joke.
19,5,I don't know why anyone has to wear a mask. I just know people who have to wear one because the government has a pretty big issue with it. They've already made a decision to wear it. It's not like everyone else wears a mask because the government is trying to make it more fun to the public. It's not the person who is trying to cut them off.

25,5,I have never seen a Vaccine Act in place.
35,5,I think the article is a joke about how to prevent people from getting sick.
36,5,I don't see how they can be a joke because they can get people sick. I'm sure it's going to take some time before it's too late.
37,5,/r/thevaccinepromising
50,5,This isn't a joke. This is a sexist joke.
53,5,"You can't put on a mask in public and get a diagnosis. It's a joke, that's all."
61,5,It's a joke. The point is that the AMA is about getting people vaccinated with a mask. The article goes on to state that the CDC and NRA have no authority to change the health care system.
66,5,You could also opine that there are not enough people who would want to go to a doctor without a mask. This is one of the issues that I can see in America.
73,5,"I grew up in a conservative town and had a lot of friends who wanted to try the EPA to protect us from a virus. But we would go out of our way to get out of our way. I was a big fan of the EPA, which is a joke."
78,5,"We've already given in to the growing craziness of the ACA. But if it was to be passed, it'd be a very serious and painful situation."
79,5,"""I don't think I'll catch the cough because I already had it i'm against them cuz they ruin the economy get people fired and people should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force."""
82,5,'I'm a huge fan of the EPA and I'm very passionate about the issues involved. I think it's strange that people think it's weird to wear a mask in the car. I think it is a good idea to fire people because of the TAX.
92,5,No. I just think a joke is going to get some attention. I think a good way to get people fired for something they don't have a right to have is to change the policy on what they do with it. It's a good idea to try and be more unbiased.
97,5,If you read a lot of the comments you'll see that the people that make such comments are just doing it because they think it's an insult to someone else and don't see the joke.
5,2,"The point of the article is that wearing a mask is not necessary to stop a virus from spreading. That's how this is going to happen, and that's exactly what the people that are complaining about wearing it, are trying to get them to do. It's actually a joke because it's just being sexist."
5,3,"I think you're making a very valid point, but there's nothing there in the way of the AMA."
19,5,"I have a friend that works at a medical insurance agency and was going to say something along the lines of ""We know a guy who took away a life insurance policy and he has no understanding of the virus. He does not have the knowledge to help prevent it."" The guy wasn't wrong and he's a racist and is likely to have to deal with the consequences of his actions. And I know the guy isn't a racist but he was right."
22,5,"I can't think of a better joke than ""If you had a face, we should just put one on for a few months, and get a vaccine,"" in the UK: ""This is a joke about the entire system."""
25,5,Vaccination isn't legal in Texas. They're not even legally legal anymore. They're not going to help combat the spread.
35,5,OP: I've been wearing a mask since I was 15 and have been wearing it every day since I was in elementary school and have not had to deal with the virus that I got a few years ago.
36,5,"A friend of mine from Florida has been saying for a long time that we should wear masks and the vaccines don't stop people from being sick. He had a joke about the NSA not telling people not to wear a mask in public health events when he was a kid. I did not realize that if he was a Democrat, he would be able to wear a hat and a hat."
37,5,"It's hard for some people to understand what a joke is. But it's also very hard for some people to figure out what a joke is, it's easy for others to get confused. It's a joke because it's a joke and it's a joke and its not a prank."
50,5,I want to see a video of the guy claiming to be a professional AIDS victim of the AMA.
53,5,"So is the AMA, or is it a joke?"
61,5,The AMA is a joke and the AMA is a joke.
66,5,"I'm a doctor and I can't help myself, and I'm not sure if it's worth the hassle of being a doctor."
73,5,"""I can’t keep my face cold because I’m in a hospital for pneumonia, but I’m very lucky not to be exposed to the infection."""
78,5,This isn't a joke - this is the entire point of the ACA.
79,5,"So, here's a prank : The government is the worst prank and the CDC is the worst prank ever made, so people don't like it, but they don't like that the CDC has some reason to be a joke and that they are the only thing that keeps people from seeing the real jokes, like the one on your Facebook page."
82,5,You're joking. You can't do that to other people's cars. The government can't fire you. You can't have someone get a criminal record for smoking in a car.
92,5,I can't even imagine how much the EPA is in the world.
97,5,"I think the joke is very true in the movie, because it's a lot of different things."
5,2,"If I don't agree, I don't know what you're talking about."
5,3,What's the joke? Is the government trying to protect public safety. It sounds like the president has a bad case of a virus but he's not in the US.
19,5,ACA repeal was a joke in itself. It wasn't intended to be a joke. It was just used to promote health issues. I've been a fan for 3 years and don't want to get a new one.
22,5,"I think it's great for the health system to have a safe and effective way to prevent the spread of disease, but it's the other way around. You could tell this to anyone who doesn't know, but it's not like it's about the government, but the government and the government itself."
25,5,They're trying to get the government to do everything it can to help. It's a joke.
