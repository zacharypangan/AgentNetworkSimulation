I wouldn't want to feel this way, but I know a lot of people have problems breathing but I don't want to feel like it's all about them."
92,32,"I think the fact that your first response to the problem is that they aren't against wearing a mask or getting the jab is just a rebuttal to the problem, it's a fact. If you look at the fact that you aren't against the mandate, it sounds like the problem is a government, not a state."
93,32,"I am not an Obama supporter, but when he turns himself in the U.S. i do the same."

32,27,What is this stuff like? Because they're wearing masks to stop the spread of a virus?
36,32,The person with the virus is a man of God. You have to be in the medical field and have the health department help you. The only problem with this is that it is a public health issue.
41,32,That is the reason why I don't wear a mask.
60,32,"No, that's the joke."
64,32,This is not a public health order at all. It's the government's petty policy to be an asshole.
73,32,I don't think he was trying to say that's a big deal. And he has to explain that the government is using that mask as a tool to stop the spread of a virus.
92,32,"Is it a problem in the state, not in the state? I'm not saying I think this isn't a problem because I don't like the idea of a mask. I don't know how to explain it but my personal opinion is that the issue is the EPA being sued for letting people without the mask wear a mask or get a jab, and the state putting up with it. I'm not going to get into this at all, but a mask is not a security precaution. They are all about security precautions."

64,32,People in the state who vote for such a thing voted against it. They have no reason to believe that the public health act is necessary for stopping spread of disease.
73,32,The only way to stop the spread of a virus is to buy a prescription for a certain amount of people to wear it. It doesn't have to be a mask.

41,32,"You're being an asshole. I think this is about the mask, not the policy."
60,32,"So, the idea of a mask is so that it will keep people from being sick, and not be a problem for them?"
64,32,It's one of the many reasons I feel like the EPA should do something about it.
73,32,he was sexist based on his username.
92,32,"A lot of the issues discussed here were about people who are not against the mandates. One of them is getting the EPA to cut funding for the mask. I also have no idea what the other two are, the federal government and their use of the word ""fake"" for a security tool."

36,32,Vaccines aren't legal anymore. They're not going to help combat the spread. If they're willing to provide the health benefits they would be more than willing to do nothing about it.
41,32,"I'm sorry, but this article is so wrong."

60,32,"Vaccines aren't even legal anymore. They're not going to help with the spread of the virus.',"

73,32,The EPA is allowing people to wear masks to prevent the spread of a virus.
92,32,"The Obama Administration and EPA are not at fault for the insanity of the ""Jail On The Federal Government."" They were fired for trying to protect the EPA from viruses. The EPA has the resources to evade these dangerous threats, and their stance on slander and terrorism is really just blatantly racist."

60,32,"If I were a lawyer, I would be able to make a joke about a very serious topic."
64,32,It's a joke that's so common that it's almost impossible to describe a joke in words with a sentence so broad and complex that even though it's pretty much a whole lot of fun to read.
73,32,It's a joke because people want to know what the joke is.
92,32,The entire point of a mask is to not use any sort of security device.
93,32,There is a difference between the two.
32,19,a man that wears a mask is not a democrat or democrat.
32,27,It's a joke because they're putting people at risk.
36,32,I believe that it's a joke.
41,32,The story is about an organization and it's how they decide to work for President Obama and the Obama administration.

92,32,"I was in a similar situation. While I was getting my face changed on my phone, I didn't think I could have a good head shot while wearing a mask. I've heard people say that the people who are wearing it are able to see where I am from and they may be able to tell me how to get a head shot. However, I'm not sure if this is a legitimate joke."
93,32,"Are you talking about the idea that it's an unprofessional joke, or a remark that the president makes all the time and has to censor the entire thing?"
32,19,"You said that a doctor who works for EPA has a history of doing sexist things, and he has no right to do so."
32,27,"That's just a jibe. I'm a lawyer. I know what it is, but my job isn't to make up a joke. It's a jibe. If you want to get out there you have to have a problem and have it fix."
36,32,It's kind of funny how the president isn't telling anyone that the government is doing anything to stop a disease or preventing it from spreading a virus.
41,32,"- ((The NRA is an organization) that's an anti-virus party. It's about'suicide' by the EPA, 'the federal government's power to take care of the environment''."

32,19,The president isn't going to be a party leader anymore if he can't act politically to stop the spread of the virus.
32,27,The jokes that come out of that article are in this thread:

41,32,"I'm just saying this: I think it is more about the mask than the policy. I think people should be allowed to choose what to wear. The story is about the EPA's power to stop the spread of a virus. It isn't a joke, because the EPA doesn't have the authority to change the health care system."
60,32,The movie doesn't really give a good understanding of a 'judgement of the whole joke'. It does give the idea of a joke to be funny and you would have to give it to the person who has a bad day.
64,32,What is this joke? The EPA hat joke?

64,32,"No, it's not a joke, it's a joke."
73,32,The prank is a joke. I'd say the joke is actually funny.
92,32,The EPA and it's govt employees have made it so a little easy for them to put a 'pappy mask' on the public.
93,32,There is an issue here. A nutjob joke is a joke about a guy who isn't a nutjob and has a history of doing things that aren't sexist and are incredibly damaging to the democrats and the republicans.
32,19,... the EPA is allowing people to wear masks to prevent the spread of a virus.
32,27,"In this subreddit, what I was expecting is a very different kind of thing - and I don't think it's a joke, just that I don't get it."

92,32,I think I'm putting this all in one sentence.
93,32,A nutjob joke? A nutjob joke is a joke that's just a joke because it's wrong. It's a joke because it's wrong. It's a joke because it's wrong.

32,27,"It's a joke, and the article is a joke. It's a joke. And it's not a joke. The government has no authority to make a rule about vaccines, and they can't regulate it. It's a joke. I think it's a joke. I don't get it. I don't get it. I don't get it."
36,32,No. The President is wearing a mask because the CDC is trying to force the government to do more.

60,32,"There is a lot of truth behind the AMA, and you can have a discussion with your lawyer and the lawyer, and say if they say something like this, they'll be happy to go with the joke and you'll not have to have a joke with their lawyer.

36,32,It's not a joke. It's a joke.
