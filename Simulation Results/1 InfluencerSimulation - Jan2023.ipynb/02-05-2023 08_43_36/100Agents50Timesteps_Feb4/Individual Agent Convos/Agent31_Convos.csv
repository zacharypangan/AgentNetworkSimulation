I've got a question."

80,31,I read that in a book in college.
95,31,"As a woman who was raised by a girl who was actually in the wrong to wear a mask outside, I have to say I understand this feeling quite well."
97,31,"What is the reason the mask is being used to protect people with serious illnesses? I'm not really sure what the reason for that is, but it may be just the language of how the person is going to think and what kind of words to say if they are to say something like ""fake"", ""twat"", ""twat"", etc. It sounds like people are very uneasy with it, and don't really understand that."
31,2,OP: you don't understand what 'twat' means. This is just part of the message you're trying to get across /u/JockeyGawker/

31,14,"There is no reason to stop people from putting a mask on themselves if they're getting sick and want to be seen, especially when there are people in public."
31,16,"I'm going to give you the most accurate explanation. Despite all the crazy stuff about masks and my opinion on them, I'm pretty sure most people with serious illnesses feel the same way, and that's not the only reason. I think it's a joke and it does seem like it's getting away with being so sexist. The idea of the mask making people feel stupid about it is kind of pathetic."

31,27,"This is not a ""joke"" or ""right"" comment."
52,31,"The CDC was not using the word shit to get the CDC to give people a name for the masks they use to protect themselves in the face of a virus. So, they're going to stop the spread of a virus. The government is not going to get off the wagon until they start doing it. They need to start doing it."
60,31,"I've heard about a guy who wore a skunk mask when he went to the party. They were wearing a skunk mask and were a joke. I'm not sure he got any sort of advice on the skunk masks. He said that it was a joke, it was a joke and it was a joke. I've seen him do it to make it easier for him to put it on because his face was so freaking weird. He made it harder to get over.

31,23,Is it a joke? Definitely.
31,27,"What a bad person. Considering the government is being involved with this and that people like you have a lot of issues with this, it doesn't seem like it would be very fair of them to put this on their face in public."
52,31,"Isn't it pretty much just a joke, shit like that?"
60,31,"I just learned from reading this article that wearing a mask is not a crime. But it's a joke that nobody is willing to talk about. There's an article from 2006 that says it's not a joke, but a joke."
76,31,I’ve been in a medical emergency for more than twenty years and this is the first time I’ve heard something like that. They are always asking for help when something isn’t going to work for them. Not sure how long it’s been around but they are in the process of trying to keep the government from getting in control and keeping it from harming my health.
80,31,"I agree. I would say if you were in the states, you'd tell your family and friends to wear a mask. They'll be shocked to hear about that as well."
95,31,I have no idea why so many people are upset with this and want to say that they are not a big fan of the joke. This is a joke.
97,31,"People don't always want to know what they want from a joke or joke, which isn't true for every joke and so they make no effort to believe it's valid."
31,2,"I think the thing is, you can't just make it sound like it's a joke."
31,4,"It is not a joke that people would take it for granted because of it being so obvious. But if you are not familiar with the law, you can tell people if they believe it is a joke."
31,8,You have made a good point. Hopefully you have no further downsizing to this /u/JockeyGawker/.
31,13,I think it's a good thing.
31,14,It's a joke.
31,16,I'm not sure if you're a huge fan or not but that is what I've heard from a lot of people on Reddit.
31,23,It seems like people are being really uneasy about it. A lot of people just don't want to be a joke about it and have no idea what they want.
31,27,"This is not a joke, it's an insult to the people who are asking for a good reason, and it's a joke to some people. This is a good thing, but not a joke."
52,31,My mom tries to make fun of us.
60,31,You're telling a joke that's funny?
76,31,I don't understand why people wear masks outside and in their cars when you're in an emergency.
80,31,There's so much going on here that it's hard to imagine this to even be a valid reason.
95,31,"So, you're just saying ""the joke is a joke""?"
97,31,People get crazy sometimes because they can't believe what they want.
31,2,The OP is an idiot.
31,4,"[Right this side: You should stop being funny because you're not a joke. I mean, I'm a fan of the government.."
31,8,I'm so excited that this is actually a joke.
31,13,I'm a little worried about what this guy's health is like.
31,14,"i read a wikipedia article that said this is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.Isn't it pretty much just a joke, shit like that?"
31,16,...the only reason the government actually does something is because people are getting mad at you.
31,23,"I'm a little tired of people being like that and calling it ""a joke"" because I'm not a big fan of a joke like that."
31,27,If I were you I'd have more information to share about this. I can’t think of any of this.
52,31,So this is a joke. The idea of that is funny. I think it's just a joke.
60,31,Isn't that what a lot of Americans are sick with the flu and we all are?
76,31,I don't understand why people wear masks outside and in their cars when you're in an emergency.
80,31,It's not a joke.
95,31,>I think the issue is that the government would be able to prevent a virus from spreading and that the threat would increase the risk of the virus if the virus were infecting.
97,31,"I think it's a good idea. I think I'd like to be as racist as this guy. He's a racist and a racist, but he's not going to be a good president unless he can change his tone and he doesn't like the way he looks."
31,2,This is why people will just put on a mask. They will go on a date.
31,4,The op is an idiot.
31,8,"That is a joke. You're not being funny because people think you are. It's a joke, you are just talking about a joke that people don't actually want to hear. I'm not saying that the'mom tries to make fun of us. You're telling a joke that's funny?"
31,13,"It's a joke and that's what it is. I am worried about the health of the guy, because I like the way people do things. I am a bit worried about the health of the guy because he looks like a douche."
31,14,OP has a point. A joke that the US has failed to properly respond to. This is not a joke.
31,16,I have a terrible idea why people need to take a joke. I'm going to make a ridiculous joke because it's funny. But I'll say it's a joke.
31,23,I don't think you have an answer.
31,27,What about a fucking joke. What is it?
52,31,I have heard of this before. I just wanted to give the joke my apologies.
60,31,"I have a feeling the people who say that wearing a mask is not a joke or that the public needs a doctor, they're just joking around with the idea of the virus."
76,31,"Yes, there is some very funny stuff going on here about how if you wear a mask to a public health emergency you are infected with something that's not something that people should need to take the time to find it, but don't wear it to avoid getting sick. I don't think it's all bad but that's about it. I do think the government should have a good reason for not getting sick if they get sick, but it's just that the government is threatening to kill anyone else's health.

31,2,A joke about a joke? You are telling a joke about a joke about a joke? What do you think it is?
31,4,"If you wear a mask in public health emergencies, you get sick, and the risk of getting sick increases. It's only a joke if the government has a good reason for stopping the spread of a virus."
31,8,"I'm not saying the CDC would be able to tell a joke, but if they didn't make it into the public health section, it wouldn't be funny."
31,13,"A. I'm not sure if you're actually going to tell people not to wear a mask, or if they think a hat screams racist, or just a hat?"
31,14,"They didn't just give people a mask. The virus spreads by people who don't know them, and then the doctor puts it out."
31,16,"This is why people want to be a doctor - and we should be doing everything in our power to help prevent the spread of the flu. The CDC wants to have a good reason not getting sick, but isn't."
31,23,>the whole point of a mask is to not wear it.
31,27,"I read that in his voice, and then he went with it, the whole thing is a hiccup to me. I've always felt that this is more about making fun of someone else's opinions than anything else, especially in my own day."

60,31,"No, they're just joking around with the idea of the virus. They want people to be safe, or to have the virus cured and that a vaccine is required to prevent that."
76,31,Vaccination is a necessity. They're not just infecting your patients but also the CDC. They are trying to keep the government from getting in control and keeping it from harming my health.
80,31,I read the headline and it came up as a joke. The NRA is being a huge ally in the effort to make the US the healthiest country in the world.
95,31,I feel like most people do not understand this.

60,31,I thought the AMA was really about the health issues at the time.
76,31,Then I would love to know what is going on with the people that are trying to put a mask on other people to get vaccinated.
80,31,"Vaccination is essential to stopping the spread of a virus.Vaccination is not required for everyone unless the person is in an advanced stage of a clinical trial. Wearing a mask doesn't help in stopping the spread of a virus. I've been sick of seeing a guy wearing a mask for about six months. That's about me.

31,8,"This isn't a joke, it's a statement that the article is full of examples. The author was right in saying, ""It's pretty ridiculous for the government to require a man to wear a mask to prevent the spread of a virus."" The author was right in saying, ""It's pretty ridiculous for the government to require a man to wear a mask to prevent the spread of a virus."" The author was right in saying, ""It’s pretty ridiculous for the government to require a man to prevent the spread of a virus."""
31,13,I don't think people are going to believe what you're saying because they don't understand the concept that racism is a joke or a joke.
31,14,"I would never wear a mask, if I were wearing a mask I would always think I had the CDC on me. I'd never wear a mask anywhere but when I walked around wearing my face mask. I was so stupid because I wouldn't think of myself as a scumbag. I was so stupid because I wouldn't think of myself as a scumbag."
31,16,This isn't a joke. This is a joke.
31,23,"So the quote is: ""It sounds like people are very uneasy with it, and don't really want to be a joke""?"
31,27,"The article is full of examples. The author was right in saying, “It’s pretty ridiculous for the government to require a man to wear a mask to prevent the spread of a virus.” The president of the US does wear a mask to prevent the spread of a virus."
52,31,The article is full of examples.
60,31,"The problem is that people don't get to decide what to say and when they do, the government doesn't have the authority to give a shit about it. It's pretty easy to say a joke. A joke doesn't make you any more likely to say a joke."
76,31,"Vaccination is a necessity. They're not just infecting your patients but also the CDC. They are trying to keep the government from getting in control and keeping it from harming your health. The NRA is trying to force people to buy vaccines, but is putting them in charge of controlling the health care system."
80,31,You're trying to get in on something a little different than what the article said.
95,31,"It’s not really funny. It doesn’t even look like a joke, but it sure sounds kind of silly."
97,31,I think it's a good idea.
31,2,The whole thing is a hiccup to me.
31,4,"This is a joke. It's not a joke, but it's a joke."
31,8,This is not a joke.
31,13,Vaccination is an essential part of any policy. I'd rather have a private one or a private one that is based on what I'm told. I don't know how the FSA and NRA can be so sure about that one.
31,14,I think this article is full of examples. Vaccination is not a joke.
31,16,I think the only thing I can think of for the day is the notion that sexist is so prevalent in the US that it's hard to really see why they have a problem.
31,23,That is not a joke. It’s a fucking joke.
31,27,It's not a joke.
52,31,A lot of this sounds more like a joke than a joke.
60,31,"I don't know why they aren't joking. This is a very common joke, a lot of the time a joke is just a joke. I don't understand why people are using this joke to talk about it."
76,31,A CDC-sponsored survey on health care. I believe they are trying to make a doc more responsible and accountable to those who do not care about their health. It is pretty sad that people are not able to keep up with this kind of information.
80,31,I would say that you're doing the right thing.
95,31,The President is taking a stand on the issue that the people who have it don't understand. He is saying that the government isn't willing to admit that their behavior is wrong. He is simply trying to make a joke about it based on his idiom.
97,31,"The thing is it's not racist because people are getting mad at the idea of this, and it's an offensive joke."
31,2,I had a feeling the joke was a joke about how the virus is going to spread and everyone who doesn't know about it is sick. I never understood what the dreaded ““““””” was like.
31,4,"The CDC has a reputation for being sexist and a parasite. The government is a parasite. The government is a parasite. The only thing they can do about it is have a shield on all the people that want to try to prevent it."""
31,8,It's not a joke. It's an extremely depressing piece of info.
31,13,People are joking that the U.S. is not a place for all the people who suffer from the same disease.
31,14,"I know the joke oh, I mean I know some people have a problem."
31,16,Vaccination is an essential part of any policy. I’d rather have a private one or a private one that is based on what I’m told.
31,23,It's not even a joke. It's an offensive joke.
31,27,"I don't think it's a joke, just that it's a joke."
52,31,"The author of this article is probably talking about this guy's experiences, not his own. So I'm assuming this is just a joke."
60,31,I'd have to make a joke and I'd be embarrassed. I can't even stand what that is.
76,31,"The NRA is also a group who promotes the spread of the CDC's vaccines, and the government is trying to force them to take over. It is not a joke and it's not an attempt to discredit it."
80,31,I wore a mask to protect myself.
95,31,"It's funny because people are using the idiom to justify their actions, but they want to say that they are not a fan of the joke."
97,31,"I'm not sure about the meaning of ""The truth"" but when you think about it, ""This guy is so hateful. That's like saying he's a racist and an actual racist. ""He's not going to be a good president unless he can change his tone and he doesn't really care about the joke."""
31,2,">I read that in his voice, and then he went with it, the whole thing is a hiccup to me.', 'The OP is correct in his comment. ::', ""The whole thing is a hiccup to me."""
31,4,I'm very familiar with the laws governing it and this particular piece is very informative. I can't help but think that it's a joke. The fact that people are joking about the vaccines doesn't make it any less of a joke than the fact that the NRA is an anti-virus group.
31,8,> People are joking that the U.S. is not a place for all the people who suffer from the same disease. I'm assuming this is just a joke.
31,13,"As an ex-police officer, I understand that a lot of things like this aren't very naive and there is probably a difference between ""yes, they are"" and ""yes, I am sure that they are."""
31,14,The CDC has a reputation for being sexist and a parasite. The government is a parasite. The government is a parasite. The government is a parasite. The only thing they can do about it is have a shield on all the people that want to try to prevent it. It's not a joke. It's an extremely depressing piece of info. People are joking that the U.S. is not a place for all the people who suffer from the same disease.
31,16,"What if I were this guy and it was a doctor, I'd get sick and that's the whole point of being a doctor? I'd be a doctor if I ever wanted to get sick."
31,23,"CANNOTANSWER: The National Rifle Association is a CDC affiliate. They are a non-profit organization that promotes virology and endemic illnesses, and has been collaborating for almost twenty years. We're not all anti-viral, but we're all people."
31,27,I thought that OP was a nice guy and it was a hiccup. I just couldn't stop laughing and thought it was a joke.
52,31,I would have called it a joke but I would have been too embarrassed to tell them - I'd just say it was just a prank.
60,31,You've been a doctor for four years and have never heard of someone wearing a skunk mask?
76,31,"Vaccination is a medical necessity, and it involves getting vaccinated. It is not a joke, it's a joke."
80,31,"If I were in the states, I'd tell my family and friends to wear a mask. I'm sure they know what the law is and have no idea what the law is."
95,31,"In this case, the joke is really simple:"
97,31,Is there a joke in the world about people wearing masks that make them feel racist?
31,2,This is a joke :)
31,4,I’m going to get downvoted for the title. I don’t have a problem with the skunk masks in r/articles.
31,8,"""I think it's funny because people are using a joke to justify their actions, but they want to say that they are not a fan of the joke."""
31,13,A doctor who thinks hats look naive and makes jokes about it is called a racist. The CDC is a parasite. The government is a parasite. The government is a parasite. The CDC is a parasite. The government is a parasite. The government is a parasite. The government is a parasite. The government is a parasite. The CDC is a parasite. The government is a parasite. The government is a parasite.
31,14,"I don't want to add any more details - the title is a joke to some sort of conspiracy theory, not just the CDC's."
31,16,"It's very funny, but I don't think anyone could be wrong about the idea that it's not a joke, or that it's not an attempt to discredit it."
31,23,I don't understand what you're going to ask.
31,27,"Unless you're wearing a mask for fun, it's not a joke."
52,31,>A lot of this sounds more like a joke than a joke.
60,31,This is the first time I have read it on the news.
76,31,This is what it says about the CDC.
80,31,"This is a real, serious issue, you will do nothing. It's not the truth, it's the people."
95,31,"""""The only way we can stop the spread of a virus is to put a shield on all the people that want to try to prevent it.', ""The only way we can stop the spread of a virus. You are a bad joke, and I just didn't make it to the end of the conversation."""
97,31,"I'm not sure why people are being so confused. I don't know what else I have to say, but a lot of them are so silly."
31,2,"What about the people who make the joke of their family or friends not wearing hats? Those things are racist, not a joke. The thing is, if someone was in a hat, they wouldn't be able to keep a tshirt or shirt on."
31,4,>The CDC has a reputation for being sexist and a parasite. The government is a parasite.
31,8,It seems like the only way to stop the spread of a virus is to put a shield on all the people that want to try to prevent it.
31,13,"I don't know how the CDC, the CDC, or the FSA would be so sure about it. It's a joke and the CDC is a parasite. The government is a parasite. The CDC is a parasite. The government is a parasite. The CDC is a parasite."
31,14,I don't think there's anything wrong with saying you have a problem with a virus. I don't think there's anything wrong with using a mask as a means to make a person feel more isolated.
31,16,The first thing I heard in the last three days was that the CDC was using masks to protect people from infection. Then a doctor came to the room and told the CDC to wear a mask.
31,23,"I don't know what the difference is between it's a joke and being an atheist. I have always felt it's a really stupid joke. In the post, it's clearly a skunk mask joke. But in the actual case it's really a joke."
31,27,I'm not gonna call you racist.
52,31,"I think the article is a good one. Unless there are some rebuttals, the comments on the post might be just being offensive. I'd try r/acnne but the articles seem very vague and vague."
60,31,I'm really glad they have gotten the information. But a mask is a joke. That's just the whole point of a mask. People haven't really done much for the past 5 years.
76,31,"""I don't understand why people wear masks outside and in their cars when you're in an emergency."""
80,31,"Vaccination is not required for everyone unless the person is in an advanced stage of a clinical trial. Wearing a mask doesn't help in stopping the spread of a virus. I read that in a book in college.', ""I read that in a book in college."
95,31,"IANAL says: ""I am not surprised that a lot of people use it to justify their actions, but I'd like to clarify how I feel."""
97,31,People are not even aware that the masks are dangerous or offensive to be wearing and it isn't just about that. This isn't racist. It's about the masks.
31,2,"The ""Skunk Mask"" joke is a joke that is being told on multiple occasions as if you're using it to justify your actions. I'm going to use the word ""skunk mask"" in my head, in an attempt to justify the people's actions. This isn't racist at all, and I'm not even sure I feel bad for it."
31,4,"""Still in the discussion. I've been watching for about 6 months"""
31,8,A lot of this sounds more like a joke than a joke.
31,13,"If they aren't ashamed of wearing a mask, why not make the hat white?"
31,14,We should start putting a mask on people in the event they see the virus.
31,16,"I'm really glad they've got the info. It's not about the joke, it's about how people can be stupid. It's not about the fact that people use a joke to justify their actions, but rather the fact that they're wrong.

31,23,"No, it's just a joke, it's a joke."
31,27,"They aren't racist, because they're racist. They're not trying to prevent people from being sick because they're black. They're trying to prevent people from being sick because they don't want their sick children to be sick. It's the same way being sick of people wearing their own mask."
52,31,"I have had an episode of HHH, and this is the first time I've ever heard someone mention it."
60,31,So I’m going to just give him the example of the guy who is wearing the mask that makes it easier to put it on.
76,31,The CDC is a nutjob. You can't have an effective vaccination.
80,31,Vaccination is essential to stopping the spread of a virus. Vaccination isn't required for everyone unless the person is in an advanced stage of a clinical trial. Wearing a mask doesn't help in stopping the spread of a virus.

31,4,"No, you're not right. I'm going to give you the word ""skunk mask"" and use it for all the people."
31,8,It's all the same joke. The joke is about an AIDS outbreak in the U.S.
31,13,"The problem isn't just racism, but how racist we're. It's the fact that you owe people a huge piece of shit to do this and keep people from thinking they're racist and how we can prevent people from thinking they are racist. This is exactly what the CDC says about people being unwarrantedly ashamed of the fact that people are'skunks'. You don't get the truth about it, it's about the fact that people have to know it's racist and hate it. Having a mask is an essential"
31,14,"""This isn't racist. They're not trying to prevent people from being sick because they're black. They're trying to prevent people from being sick because they don't want their sick children to be sick."""
31,16,I'm going to give you the most accurate explanation.
31,23,"I really feel uncomfortable saying this, but it's a joke. It's racist, and the only people in the world that deem it offensive are the affluent. It's a joke."
31,27,"I think the article is right to say that the article is full of examples. The author was right to say, “It’s pretty ridiculous for the government to require a man to wear a mask to prevent the spread of a virus.”"
52,31,The CDC tries to put an actual threat to a human.
60,31,People don't have to tell a joke when they are joking about something. If you can't stop a joke from making fun of someone's joke you'll get a karma badge.
76,31,I'd be very surprised if the actual CDC is so stupid to bring up this shit on the internet.
80,31,The NRA is trying to re-shape the health of the population. The truth is they are getting very angry about this and are making them a bad ally to help. They just can't make the people understand that they're wrong.
95,31,">I don't see how the govt is going to do that, because they are just making excuses to continue."
97,31,I don't have a job but I'd like to be as racist as this guy. I'd like him to be able to see people and be a racist.

31,8,"The story is about a woman who was in an outbreak and is scared of getting the virus. This is a joke, it is about people trying to prevent it by telling a joke about the viral infection."
31,13,This guy is making it all over the Internet. It's not a joke. I think he's trying to get the point across. This isn't a joke.
31,14,Vaccination is a part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

31,23,"It's racist, but it's a joke."
31,27,"A bit of a cliché to sound racist. But no, the NRA is trying to re-shape the population, and that is why they don't want to help people with this. They want to keep their own people from doing their own thing for them. They want to keep their own people safe."

52,31,I don't get it. It doesn't matter what you wear. A mask is useful. It's not a joke. It's a joke. And the only thing that bothers me is that I've never heard of it. Unless a prick makes fun of a person he doesn't know about and doesn't know his responsibilities.
