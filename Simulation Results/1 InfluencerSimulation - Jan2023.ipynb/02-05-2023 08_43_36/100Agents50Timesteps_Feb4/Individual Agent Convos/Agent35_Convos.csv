70,35,"I have been thinking this for a long time, but in a way I'm more interested in your opinion. If you're a racist, then you're right to be indifferent to a lot of things on here."

35,23,I'm sorry to hear this.
35,25,This was about a hilarity in terms of a medically unnecessary and not healthy choice of subject.
36,35,"This is how the news media should have reported the CDC and NRA on a few occasions. There's a whole bunch of rants from this guy, but no one actually said they would do the hat thing because I don't understand what they're talking about. It's not really a joke."
41,35,I think the issue is with a lot of the anti-vaxxers movement.
45,35,Vaccination is not required for everyone unless the person is in an advanced stage of a clinical trial.
50,35,I think that people who think they have a moral obligation to go outside are the kind of people that are going to say no to this.
54,35,They don't have a specific set of rules about what a public health order is for or what an organization needs to be concerned about. They just do what they want.

35,14,"I don't know if anyone else is reading it, but there are plenty of posts about that."

45,35,I don't think there's enough to say about it. Probably doesn't even sound like a joke. It sounds like a bunch of hoops aimed at making people sick to get away with it. Then it just becomes a prank.

79,35,"I don't think a bad joke would be so fun. The best way to get rid of a joke is to just not make it. It makes it easier for you to see that people are clinging to their racist agenda. And that's a bit of a petty joke, huh?"
82,35,"The article states that while it is illegal, the mask is necessary to prevent an outbreak, and is considered a criminal action in the US."
92,35,There is a new sub that uses this. It is basically a discussion about how the federal government and its agencies are using EPAs to evade the threat of retaliation. The first sentence gives the idea of a job that is free. The second sentence suggests a job that is free of it.
94,35,I'm a medical student. I'm a physician. I wear masks. I can't believe that this is true.

70,35,[The AMA was meant to be an unpopular opinion and the meme was a joke. The people were just happy it was a joke.

79,35,No. This is the way to get into the legal world.
82,35,"In the US, they can fire people who don't comply with the regulations and would be fired for violating them."

54,35,The ACA isn't what the US government wants. It was a result of a fad. It wasn't what the federal government wants.

50,35,Vaccination is a good thing and is being criticized. They have made the problem of this a little less serious. I don't think it's a joke.
54,35,This isn't the ACA.
68,35,"Then, on a related note, a dissenting opinion of the article is also coming from a dissenting view of this particular issue."
70,35,Is this the top comment on any discussion of a tumblr subreddit?
78,35,"CANNOTANSWER: The only thing I don't understand is the fact that the government is attempting to make them wear a mask in public, and they are not allowed to do so is really telling.

35,22,They're going to try to do something about it to try to control public health.

70,35,The President is not racist. He is racist. The fact that he did not wear a mask is a sexism joke.
78,35,This is where a lot of things start to get confusing.
79,35,People who say they are 'not against a prank' that they just aren't going to take seriously are just going to make fun of the government.
82,35,There's no other law that would enforce it. Isn't that the law being changed?
92,35,They are the only ones with the power to stop the spread of the virus.
94,35,"That's not what's a joke. That's a joke. And a joke, because there are reasons for it."
101,35,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
35,5,"The article is about a ""problem"" that exists within the context of the ""problem""."
35,8,"""What is this ""fake"" joke?"""
35,10,I think the most useful thing for this sub is that it's a joke. It's a joke. It's not a joke. The ACA and the CDC aren't in line with the national healthcare plan.
35,14,"There's nothing wrong with it. The ACA isn't being implemented. They can't even enforce it, so they are just reversing the trend of wearing a hat to avoid repercussions."
35,20,I think this should be a very high profile job for people with HIV/AIDS.
35,22,What's wrong with wearing a mask?
35,23,"I'm not sure about the context of the article, but there's a bunch of things that should be said that are not consistent with the definitions of a prank - people saying ""I don't understand why people are afraid of wearing a mask"" etc. that are in that situation."
35,25,"This is going to be funny. The CDC should tell you what the ACA is, but I don't see that going out of the way to try and stop the spread. That's a joke to tell you what the government needs to do to stop this."
36,35,The CDC and NRA have been putting out jokes on how much they have paid people to wear hats to help prevent a virus in public. This was the best way for the EPA to put a hat on when you're ill.
41,35,"I think it is a joke that the EPA was going to ban. The article is just a joke, in that the EPA and CDC have the authority to change the healthcare system."
45,35,"A few things. First, I'm not a racist. It's a prank. But it's a joke."
50,35,The idea is to avoid using masks that cause infected people to be more likely to get infected. That's why it's not a joke.
54,35,"That's not a joke, that's a joke."
68,35,"> The article isn't exactly a good way to look at it, but it's a good way to look at how the mask is used."", ""Then, on a related note, a dissenting opinion of the article is also coming from a dissenting view of this particular issue. The article makes the most sense."
70,35,"I think you're just being a bit jaded, and have a lot of feelings for the guy, and the joke is very very inappropriate. It's the guy who said the joke he wore, and the joke he was doing is kinda depressing. It sounds like he was doing the joke, but he doesn't want to go up in arms because of it."
78,35,"It's really strange that I'm reading something like this but I am just reading it. I was just reading about a joke about a dick. And it's in the first sentence, ""I don't think the ACA is a joke."
79,35,"The government's attempting to fuck people, allowing them to be a joke, but that's a joke."
82,35,A skunk in your car is not a crime. A skunk is a phsc.
92,35,"I don't get why anyone would want to pay for an actual job. Until they are fired they don't need it, so they don't suck on the jobs of other people."
94,35,It's funny to say that this is a joke. It is. You can't help but smile when you don't have a mask. It's more about a joke than a joke.
101,35,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
35,5,The article is about how to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS.
35,8,I thought that a lot of the jokes in that article were just a joke and were made to make some sense and some people were being funny.
35,10,"It's a joke. The article is about what they're trying to stop. It's about the idea that a snore mask will help prevent a viral infection. It's about how it's a joke and why they aren't being implemented. The article doesn't really give much context, and the headlines seem like they don't really address it as much as what a joke."
35,14,"Those words are very misleading. Considering you know what the EPA has said about ACA and hats, I think that it would be a good idea to wear a mask to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS. It's a joke, but I think it's an effective way to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS."
35,20,You think you should see it all the time.
35,22,"They are trying to do a prank about this. If the president doesn't want to stop it, he won't. It's not a joke, it's a prank. It's a joke. The ACA has no power over public health. It's just a joke."
35,23,"I think I've heard that the CDC doesn't want to give people the vaccine but if they do, why would they. This is a joke despite what a joke the CDC is going to make it to prevent. This is a joke with its implication being that it's a joke."
35,25,They're also telling the story of how this man wants his son to be taught how to protect his children from the spread of the virus by telling him to keep his head up and not put on his mask.
36,35,What's a hat? Does it fit the face?
41,35,"""The article states it's a joke. The article states it's a joke. The article states it's a joke. The article states it's a joke."
45,35,I've never heard of anyone saying that the ACA isn't mandatory for everyone unless the person is in an advanced stage of a clinical trial. I've never heard of anyone arguing that it's a joke.
50,35,There's a link in the AMA somewhere.
54,35,"CANNOTANSWER: ""[NAME]] is a doctor and I'm a doctor. But I still don't think a mask will prevent people from getting sick because it's the fad or stigma surrounding the idea of a vaccine."", ""I think the ACA isn't what the US government wants. It was a result of a fad. It wasn't what the federal government wants."", ""I read the whole thing and thought it was hilarious that hats don't prevent people from getting sick because it'"
68,35,"The entire article is a joke, but he was referring to a fact a lot of people have never heard about."
70,35,Is this a joke?
78,35,"The whole thing is funny. Clearly, you aren't serious and you aren't the one to make it a joke."
79,35,Because it's a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke. Those are the pranks in the r/h1g1 article.
82,35,"I am not a lawyer, I am not a politician, I am a politician. I am a lawyer."
92,35,"I think you're an asshole, but you are trying to make a joke. I'm a nutjob. I don't understand what you're trying to explain. It's a joke."
94,35,It's a joke because the government doesn't know what the virus means.
101,35,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
35,5,It is the joke in this post. The AMA is basically going to be a prank. This is what is gonna happen next. The article is going to start with something like [(R/Rights Against Healthcare](https://www.apo.nc.gov/se/public_health_of-political-propaganda-assault-on-vaccinetion](https://www.apo.nc.gov/se/public_health_assault-on-vaccinetion](https
35,8,Vaccination isn't a joke. It's a joke because people don't know it.
35,10,I think it's funny because it's a joke. It's not a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke.
35,14,CANNOTANSWER:
35,20,"I've never heard of a prank about the ACA, but it's not a joke, because if you want to see it all the time, you need to go and put on a mask for your patients, because the only reason people do that in the US is because it's a joke."
35,22,No. Because the ACA doesn't help stop the spread of a virus.
35,23,"It's a joke because the CDC is trying to make it a joke and not a joke. And the joke isn't going to be used in any meaningful way because the CDC is doing something that is not relevant and you will end up making that joke later, or because people will think it is."
35,25,"It's been around for about four years. The ACA is not a joke, it's a joke. It's a joke."
36,35,"As someone who has been in a lot of hats that have been in public, I can say this:"
41,35,"""I think it’s a shame that it was banned, because it’s a joke. The article states it’s a joke."""
45,35,I've done a lot of research and I think the ACA is just a joke.
50,35,"In one of the AMAs I read, he said that he thought it was a joke because he was describing something from the CDC."
54,35,"A mask is a joke, not a joke."
68,35,"AMA and AMA. The story is funny but the people referring to the AMA are being downvoted. ""That isn't funny. The AMA is not funny."""
70,35,So you're going to say ''I don't think it's too bad that this is the most ridiculous thing on reddit ever.
78,35,This is a pretty good example of the underlying idea.
79,35,"""Won't if it weren't for the craziness of the mandates, I'd rather be a man who wouldn't wear a mask and a hat."""
82,35,">I'm a very smart, very funny, and super-sensical guy. I'm interested in this guy...I'm interested in his sense of humor."", ""In my experience, wearing a mask outside is not a crime."
92,35,What's wrong with not wanting to have a job?
94,35,“...because it isn’t necessary. It isn’t even necessary. It isn’t even necessary. It isn’t even necessary. It isn’t even necessary. It isn’t even necessary. It isn’t even necessary. It isn’t even necessary. It isn’t even necessary. It isn’t even necessary. It isn’t even necessary. It isn’t even necessary. It isn’t even necessary. It isn’t even necessary.
101,35,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
35,5,The AMA is going to be a joke.
35,8,A doctor who wears a mask is also a joke because it isn’t in line with the ACA.
35,10,"""It's funny because there is no right or wrong way for them to say what they want. It's the best choice to do now."
35,14,You can still take your own advice. They are attempting to get people to get vaccinations and it doesn't work.
35,20,It's a joke. But it does not make it a joke. Whether people are against it or not.
35,22,I'm not sure what the hive mind is going through right now.
35,23,I am not a doctor.
35,25,I feel like the first time we read the article was about a prank about the ACA that was made by the government to prevent spreading of AIDS.
36,35,I think the hat is a joke because the person is putting it on to get people to wear it.
41,35,The EPA and CDC can't fire people for anything because of it.
45,35,"""The ACA isn't a prank. It's a joke, but it's not enforceable."""
50,35,AMA is basically the same thing. A public health class and then a school sponsored AMA. The AMA is actually a joke. You can't be racist on a joke when people are pointing to it.
54,35,What's the point of being a doctor? Is a mask a joke?
68,35,"> ""Then, on a related note, a dissenting opinion of the article is also coming from a dissenting view of this particular issue."

78,35,I mean - what's the point?
79,35,"As a lawyer, I've read a few articles where a prank was made about the government and the CDC."
82,35,It's a crime for people to not wear a mask outside of a public place.
92,35,What you say is a good joke. It is a joke.
94,35,It's a joke about people saying it isn't necessary to prevent the spread of a virus.
101,35,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
35,5,Nope. It's a shitstorm and the president doesn't want to fix it.
35,8,CANNOTANSWER: 'Wooding a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. '
35,10,"if you like it, you can get a hat. It's better than a hoodie."
35,14,People like the word hat.
35,20,"""If the CDC is right, they should fire anyone in that position. If they did not have a criminal license,"""
35,22,The CDC and the CDC have a very different perspective on this issue. They are not attempting to stop spread of AIDS. They are trying to discourage people from getting vaccinated. They are not doing something about it.
35,23,The CDC can't fire anyone for a joke about HIV/AIDS but the article is about a joke about the government and a prank about the ACA.
35,25,Why do you think the article is a joke? Because you want to be a joke?
36,35,"> ""I hate when people say things like ""I love you."
41,35,"If a group has the power to ban a pcm, they can make a joke."
45,35,I think they're trying to force the government to change the law to get people to change the law.
50,35,AMA is not a joke.
54,35,"A hat prevents the spread of viruses, is a joke but it isn't a joke."
68,35,">""It makes the point that people aren't willing to take it seriously."""
70,35,I've gotten an upvote from all the comments I've seen. I was so mad I retracted the title.
78,35,It's a joke that is the same as the ACA - a joke to avoid the joke being lost in translation. A bit of a joke.
79,35,People who say that it is not funny and you snore is just part of a joke are just going to be stupid.
82,35,"The article states it is a crime to wear a mask outside of a public place, because it is against the law."
92,35,"""'(i think they are talking about the EPA and the EPA. ') they are not allowed to smoke, do or not smoke in the country, and that's their job.'"
94,35,"There's a lot of things going on in the US that could make you sick to not need a vaccine. There's also a lot of stuff that doesn't happen anywhere in our world except in America, mainly America. It's not a joke, but a joke about people saying it's not necessary."
101,35,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
35,5,"That's not a joke. It's a joke. I don't think it's a prank, it's a joke."
35,8,">I've been looking for a new job lately. Vaccination isn't mandatory, I just have a helmet"
35,10,"A doctor would probably be out there for it, and there's nothing there. There's nothing wrong with it. And the point is it's not a joke. The article is about the issue, but about the ACA and the CDC. It's about what the ACA is trying to stop. They are trying to stop the spread of AIDS. They aren't attempting to stop it. They are trying to discourage people from getting vaccinated."
35,14,The ACA has nothing to do with that. It is being used as a prank. It has nothing to do with that.
35,20,"Are you a doctor? Because the government doesn't really know what they are doing and has no duty to prevent that prank. If you don't have a job in public health and you are a doctor, then you need a doctor. It is a very common joke and we all know pranks happen and they're a prank."
35,22,This was a joke. And it is. They are not trying to change it.
35,23,It's a joke that doesn't happen anywhere in the world except in America.
35,25,CANNOTANSWER: 'Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
36,35,I'm sorry but this is a joke. This shit is ridiculous. The hat is a joke.
41,35,The people in the article (including yourself) aren't really doing what they're doing. And the fact that you said it's a joke about the EPA and the CDC is an indication of the situation.
45,35,Vaccination is a prank. It's a joke.
50,35,I do believe that being a student on a medical school bus is the wrong thing to do. It's very much a joke. And I'm a little aghast that it's the best way to get people to stop getting vaccinated. It's just a joke because we're so big on the CDC.
54,35,"""But why don't I think it's a joke?"""
68,35,"> In the US, Vaccination isn't mandatory for everyone unless the person is in an advanced stage of a clinical trial."
70,35,So what a joke. What a dick.
78,35,CANNOTANSWER:
79,35,I think there is a lot to discuss here. The whole thing is a joke. They're trying to fuck people. The government has no power. The CDC has no power. But they don't have the right to regulate it. They have no authority.
82,35,...I can't believe that the article is misleading because the article doesn't specify which state is suing the EPA for the issue.
92,35,I am not even a government worker so I can’t speak for any sexist person.
94,35,Vaccination isn't mandatory. It isn't even necessary. It isn't even necessary. It isn't even necessary. It isn't even necessary. It isn't even necessary. It isn't even necessary.
