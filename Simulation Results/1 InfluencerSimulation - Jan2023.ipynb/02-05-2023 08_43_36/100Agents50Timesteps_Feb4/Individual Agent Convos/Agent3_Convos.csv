25,3,I've never done something like this in my life. I'm so embarrassed. I feel like I'm not going to get much karma for the jokes. It's all a joke and a prank.
41,3,I've never heard of anyone who's just in a mask.
50,3,We should change our policy to let people out of school. They could be more concerned about a mask being in the body than what the CDC has already decided.
57,3,">I mean, people want to have the right to wear whatever they want, and they want to do the right thing."
61,3,"I've actually been to a CDC event, and that is about the biggest thing I've ever seen. They are the worst government sabotage force you to go to, and I am sure the CDC is involved, which is why I'm sure they sabotage it."
63,3,"In my experience, people will put the government's vaccinations policies behind their policies and it's very hard to put them back on the list."
64,3,"The author of the article has a title about a school that was torn up because of a false claim. Basically he said the school board voted against it because they didn't have to pay to get a private health insurance. This is a bit like saying that in the UK, ""we are just as sexist as Donald J. Trump was. Why do you think this would be a good idea? "", and that it isn't a joke."
65,3,> The idea of a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
68,3,"Well, it doesn't have to be a joke in itself, but a little bit of an indignation."
71,3,"There's a lot of bad humor, but in this context, I think it's actually about the situation."
85,3,So I want to call him out on being an asshole for refusing to wear a mask.
5,3,"Yeah, I am not in the US, but the NRA is being used to help prevent the spread of HIV."
15,3,"""The mask isn't part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. This is a bad point. We're just having a huge problem and people need to talk to the government. I think this makes sense. And the author was right in saying, ""It's pretty ridiculous for the government to require a man to wear a mask to prevent the spread of a virus."""
18,3,"It is not only an example of ""snarky,"" but it's a generalization that people will get sick with a virus. I am not saying that is necessarily wrong. If you look at the article it's basically ""you are making a joke to make people feel safer,"" but it doesn't really seem snarky to me. It seems like there are a lot of people who are trying to make the joke snarky."
22,3,"I think the government is doing the right thing. That's the thing, and if it was just a joke, it would be a whole lot worse."
25,3,"You know what I mean, I don't have any ideas about what you're saying."
41,3,"If you haven't heard of the anti-vaxxer movement, I'm sorry for your loss."
50,3,Is this a joke?
57,3,You aren't going to get much respect by rewriting the thread.
61,3,Vaccination is a crime and your parents should not have to deal with it.
63,3,I don't think the article in the article is a joke. The article is based on the fact that a lot of the people in the article are not really accustomed to wearing a mask.
64,3,"I can't tell if it's a joke or a joke, but it is an unrelated piece of information about a government law that does not apply in the USA. A 'Veteran' is an idiom which is not as widespread as a joke."
65,3,So this guy is saying I need to put a mask on and I'm not trying to be a joke. What's the point of this?
68,3,"No, the president doesn't wear a mask to stop the spread of the virus, so he doesn't have to wear a mask or wear a hoodie, and he didn't sexize himself in public. This isn't a joke."
71,3,I was one of the only few people on my list I knew who said that they needed to wear a mask.
85,3,I don't really want to call the president an asshole because of it. I'm an anti-vaccine doctor and I don't understand why he wouldn't want to wear a mask. It's just a joke.
5,3,[Simpsons Idiot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SimpsonsIdiot/) They want to teach their young kids how they'll do it in order to prevent spreading of the virus.
15,3,There is no way to go around it.
18,3,Why not go fuck yourself.
22,3,"I think you've listened to the whole of the AMA section here, but there is so much left in the article. I find it really sad and am not sure what else you need to read or that you want the AMA to continue."
25,3,"It's very easy to see that a doctor does not even give a medical opinion and a skunk is getting sick. I'd be surprised if the government actually did. They have a really good reason to believe that they are not being the most effective, which they should."
41,3,You're not anti-Vaxx. And you're not a conservative.
50,3,What is the point of this article?
57,3,It was a joke for a while. We need to end it. And we need to stop it. We need to make it to the bottom.
61,3,"I'd be interested in a way to make a government-sponsored health screening to make sure the CDC isn't using the sysadmins a big deal and have them vaccinate everyone involved. It might be a way to help you figure out how to do that. I will let you know if you want to do that. I've got a bunch of my fiancee's kids, but we still have no money to invest in insurance."
63,3,"I think that the article was a joke, as is the premise. And if it is a joke that the CDC is making it out to be a joke, why wouldn't you have a copy of the article?"
64,3,The Obama administration is taking a lot of sides with the EPA.

71,3,We have to talk about the virus.

5,3,I don't understand what it means to have a mask if you don't like it
15,3,The only reason for people to take it to the doctor is that the government was involved in making it illegal for the American people to carry HIV/AIDS.
18,3,It sounds like the CDC is trying to take people's hats' a little too far fetched and overly generalized.
22,3,"I'm gonna be really upset if people wear masks, but I just can't keep up with the current media mania."
25,3,I'm assuming you are on reddit or on the internet and you don't want to be insulted by it.
41,3,The article is about the CDC.
50,3,"""(N)o, not in a nutshell."
57,3,I'm sure a good portion of these people are not all right.
61,3,They are not a government agency. They haven't been able to issue vaccines in the past. But they are trying to sabotage this idea by not making people on their health care vaccinated and giving them the proper information.
63,3,"It's not a joke unless it's a joke, because it's an illegal thing to use your personal ID for a personal purpose."
64,3,"I'd start by writing a little bit about the mask and make a little bit of a comment on it. As a person that's been through some very bad times in my entire life, I am beginning to understand that the issue of whether it's funny or not, can be confusing in a very wide sense."
65,3,"I would argue that we don't need a mask to stop the spread of a virus, but we have to go to a CDC to get a vaccine to protect everyone."
68,3,"CANNOTANSWER: The article's not a good read. It's not funny. Yes, but it's funny because you can't keep the cliche."
71,3,Thats an interesting premise.
85,3,"There is no reason for someone to not wear a mask, even if it's a joke."
5,3,"I don't know what's the point of this joke, but I do want to know what's the point of this? The point is to explain why there's a reason to go to church and not do anything hat-style."
15,3,"As a teen and a teen, it's pretty ridiculous."
18,3,I'm just trying to say I've read some of the comments and they don't sound very snarky.
22,3,I’ve been talking to some people on the internet about how they don’t think they’re being serious about anything.
25,3,"I don't want to get insulted by it, and I don't want to get insulted by it."
41,3,"If you're gonna eat your poop when the skunks kill you, you're doing it wrong."
50,3,The AMA is a waste of time and is not going to help anyone. You're wrong. You're just a joke.
57,3,"> I mean, people want to have the right to have the right to wear whatever they want, and they want to do the right thing."
61,3,The government is not a gov't.
63,3,People have no idea what it is. But they do know a joke is the same as the original.
64,3,What are the costs of the EPA?
65,3,"I read that the reason 'they're using them as an excuse to help people, not just their own health' was that people can get a vaccine without wearing a mask."
68,3,"It says ""the issue of what you need to wear a mask to protect yourself has been the same for several presidents in the past, and we are going to have a lot of problems in the future because of that."""
71,3,"What about a friend who said he needed to eat a few times, get his job, famine was averted. And a lot of people that lived in a country that isn't much worse than it is, because they live on government property. They've gotten better, but are in no way reclaiming their life, so they don't have to wear masks."
85,3,CANNOTANSWER: Vaccination is not required for everybody unless the person is in an advanced stage of a clinical trial.
5,3,Apparently the EPA is trying to keep it in compliance with the new rules and regulations for the health care system.
15,3,It's a joke. A fucking joke.
18,3,I think the only snarkiness in this post is that I don't really understand what the CDC's role in this problem is.
22,3,"I'm not saying it's a joke. It's an observation. It's not a joke. It's a joke. You are making a joke. It's the CIA, the US government, the US Department of Homeland Security, and other federal agencies."
25,3,"You know what? [In the US, the word ""fake"" comes from ""fake."" In the US, the word ""fake"" comes from ""fake."""
41,3,"It seems to me the NRA, the NRA, the IAEA, the CDC, and the CDC are trying to keep people safe and not make the public aware of what's going on."
50,3,AMA is not a joke. It is a joke.
57,3,"This was just a joke. It's not a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke, it's a joke because it's a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke and people want it. This is a joke because it's a joke and a joke because it's a joke."
61,3,"If it were me, I would call all of them idiots a terrorist organization."
63,3,"Vaccines are a joke. They don't actually fight against it. The only thing that has ever been done has been to make it worse, and the CDC's response was absolutely horrifying."
64,3,"If you read the article, you see that it was a 'phew!' joke. The school said that the mask was to help stop the spread of a virus."
65,3,The idea of wearing a mask to stop the spread of a virus is an excuse to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. It's a joke and the article is about that.
68,3,I don't think there's much that'sad joke' and 'i'm just saying the fact that he says it's funny because he believes it's necessary to protect himself would have a negative impact on the health of the person who's wearing the mask'.
71,3,"[NAME]: The article has got a few good quotes from different parts of the country. There are so many things people have done, including taking pictures of the food, getting married, and getting divorced. People are just a bunch of people who can't be able to afford to move. People can be cruel. We could be mean or nasty to people. Is it OK to be a good guy and help the poor?"
85,3,"If we want to get vaccinated, we need a federal mandate for a medical device that doesn't have to be covered by it."
5,3,I am not a big fan of the ACA. It isn't the ACA.
15,3,"What? I mean, that's not a joke."
18,3,I read this when i was a little kid and it really helped.
22,3,"The first time I wore a mask in public was about the CDC and the CDC, and I wore a mask."
25,3,I would like to thank everyone for this post.
41,3,I was really excited to learn that the NRA made it to the US with the intention of stopping it.
50,3,Yes. That's a joke. The AMA is actually a legitimate joke.
57,3,I’m a coach and I don’t play for the school anymore. I want to be a leader but my job is to do the right thing.
61,3,"So, in order to reaffirm the existence of the government, he had to wear a mask, while in office, and he had to vaccinate people, because there is a possibility he would die?"
63,3,"Vaccination is the best method for dealing with the health problem without taking the government's advice or guidance in a manner that could potentially cause a major death. In many countries people are not being vaccinated at all, or having the vaccine on their hand doesn't make things worse. There is no legal implication on that as the best way to deal with it, and it's a joke."
64,3,"My husband has had a similar problem with the school. He went to a school for two days, went to see him and walked out, went to a doctor and ended up with a traumatic heart attack and had to be resuscitated. It was in a public health school, and in a shambles hospital, I was in a situation like that. It was more like he left a job he wasn't interested in."

68,3,It's not a joke. It's a joke. It's not a joke.
71,3,The USA has no power. Is that what you think? The government is only acting to get people sick. Using a mask to help protect people against HIV. Is that not what the article says?
