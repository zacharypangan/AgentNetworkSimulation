41,8,"People in general have a right to wear a mask if it is deemed to protect them from their own body. That being said, this whole thread is about a lot of people who are sick with superspreaders (if not the very few that are actually alive) and who don't like it."

41,21,I hate to tell you that wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
41,32,And not the people who want to wear a mask
41,35,I don't understand why they insist on having people dress like that in churches and people have a right to not wear a mask.

41,40,"The whole point of a mask is to stop the spread of a virus by taking a swivel, which is a natural reaction to an illness like Covid and Covid, iirc"
53,41,No I think that s just the fucking nonsense that's going on here.
65,41,"You don't know what mask is, you just think it's a good idea."
79,41,"IANAL and a few others haven't commented on the 'i don't believe'part of the government mandates. If you voted for the 'I don't believe'part, you are not an expert or a politician."

91,41,That's not a mask.
41,1,"As an Australian, I can see that a mask is a good idea, but it doesn't prevent the spread of the virus. I'm a big fan of this kind of thing."
41,3,You are trying to discredit the apocalypse movement for not taking a stand against the mask.
41,6,"Well, it's a whole different thing for them, because you don't want them to wear a mask."

41,13,"I don't know about the masks, but it's part of the 'what's the point?' part, that's how the op's response is a big part of how the op thinks that superspray is really the only way to stop a virus."
41,16,This is the post that prompted me to post this. It has a lot of stuff going on.
41,20,I don't like the way you think about masks.
41,21,I think the whole point of a mask is to stop the spread of a virus.
41,32,You've got a problem with your assumptions.
41,35,IANAL but I have worked for a public hospital and we had no issue wearing a mask - a very unattractive thing to do when going through an emergency situation.
41,37,I figured the people would find something else. i don't think wearing a mask would stop the spread of a virus. i think it would be less likely to kill the person who was bitten and the one who was killed.
41,39,Is there anything that makes people 'wearing a mask' think of a good idea? Or does it simply imply that you have no business knowing who to vote for?
41,40,"I feel the same way, but I also want a copy of this... It's in a book about the anti-spray movement."
53,41,Honestly I'd rather not wear a mask and if I ever had one on I'd just sit there and talk.
65,41,This is one of the most relevant articles I've read.
79,41,IANAL and a few others haven't commented on the 'I don't believe'part of the government mandates.
84,41,It is also a part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
91,41,"oh no you don't, it's not a mask - i have a helmet, i am wearing a mask - why is it a mask?"
41,1,"> ""I'm a big fan of this kind of thing. You are trying to discredit the apocalypse movement for not taking a stand against the mask."
41,3,"Aside from the first part. I think you're right, I'm not a fan of this kind of stuff. And I'm not a fan of anything that equates to 'in the next post I'm going to say, you are trying to discredit the apocalypse movement for not taking a stand against the mask.'"
41,6,The apocalypse and the anti-spray movement are the ones I've encountered in a lot of my work.
41,8,"This is why we don't wear masks, not the same thing you do."
41,11,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.That's not a mask. As an Australian, I can see that a mask is a good idea, but it doesn't prevent the spread of the virus."
41,13,"As a person who is in a position to wear a mask in a workplace in a position of government responsibility, putting on a mask in a workplace and putting on a helmet (what kind of person who wears it will always be a victim)."
41,16,This is an extremely relevant issue. I think you should probably consider restraining orders and how to handle this.
41,20,I'm a big fan of this kind of thing. You are trying to discredit the apocalypse movement for not taking a stand against the mask.
41,21,'Mask a doctor what you can about wearing a mask'
41,32,That is the reason why I don't wear a mask.
41,35,">I don't understand why they insist on having people dress like that in churches and people have a right to not wear a mask."""
41,37,So you are saying the government should not give the right to wear a mask and only give them a certain amount of power?
41,39,"I know that the article in question is a bit biased. I thought it was a great idea. I think it is a shame that it was banned, because it's a kind of political statement. I'm not saying it's unjust."
41,40,"... and if you're actually a fan of superspray, that's a pretty good place to start."
53,41,I'm going to be totally honest with you about the mask issue.
65,41,"I would suggest the government put a shack in a medical center and make a video proving that masks have the potential to stop people from getting a sick person. If it has been able to prevent the spread, it could be used to kill people if they are not careful."
79,41,"I don't know if that was my idea, but it's a good idea. This was originally proposed by the conservative party, which has a history of being anti-immigrant, anti-ethnic and anti-feminist."
84,41,"I think that a lot of the skepticism that comes with the federal government's approach to protecting health care should be put to rest. I think that when the federal government decides to pass a law that protects the public from the CDC, they have some say in whether to require it. The federal government is trying to do this."
91,41,"The government doesn't have the ability to have an official that isn't involved with the problem. The problem is that there is no right or wrong way for them to say what they want. The government wants to help people in their own country. It also wants the government to stop the spread of a virus, so we don't have to think about it that way."
41,1,"So you are saying the government should not give the right to wear a mask and only give them a certain amount of power? I think that it's a shame that it was banned, because it's a kind of political statement."
41,3,"I'm really curious about the ""consumers of a vaccine"" movement and how it relates to the death of a family member who was the primary target."
41,6,I think this is the one of the only times I know that the federal government can't have the proper legal protections.
41,8,"I have a friend who is sick with a virus. He has a helmet, a mask and a mask."
41,11,"We have to stop the spread of a virus, so we can be completely honest."
41,13,"It seems a little anti-feminist to say things like ""I'm going to get a restraining order,"" or ""I don't understand why they insist on having people dress like that in churches and people have a right to not wear a mask."" It sounds like the op is simply trying to discredit the anti-spray movement."
41,16,>I'm a big fan of this kind of thing.
41,20,I think you are being an asshole.
41,21,"It's also not really a national issue. But there's also an issue with the fact that the government is trying to put people at risk by cutting a job. This might work in my state, too, and I think they should be working on a law preventing people from getting sick - but you're right it's not just the federal government."
41,32,"""Making a shack in a medical center and making a video proving that masks have the potential to stop people from getting a sick person."""
41,35,"OP, I would suggest putting on a shack in a medical center and make a video proving that masks have the potential to prevent people from getting a sick person.

53,41,I think it is a little too early to tell. Is this what the health departments should be doing?
65,41,Why are people not wearing masks because they want to avoid getting sick from the spread of a virus. I think that it's not really a good idea.

You will probably want to make the choice."", 'i think your comment was a bit misleading, in that they were not in any way hostile. I'm a republican and I'm not sure what that was. Is it any different from your post on the subject."
84,41,"It sounded like he would have been in a much more civilized position than any other person. It might also be the case that he is in a better position to be a better leader than most other people, which is why he was in a better position to be a leader. But, as long as he's not in a place of leadership who has no authority in the government and is not a democrat, then he has not been in a good position to be a leader."
91,41,There are different ways you can do the work of a government official.
41,1,"I think a mask is necessary. That's why it is so common to see an anti-virus group in a bunch of churches in a particular city and when it comes to the health of a vulnerable population, it's just a fucking thing."
41,3,"I believe that the government is not actively trying to discredit any of the anti-vaxxers movements. The government is trying to stop the spread of the Virus. I think it is a shame that it was banned, because it's a kind of political statement."

41,11,[This](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wooding_a_Maske_An-Maske) is a placeholder title. It is a placeholder title.

41,16,"i want to read more about this, which is a nice way to say it, but do you want to think about the ""consumers of a vaccine"" movement and how it relates to the death of a family member who was the primary target?"
41,20,Is there another way you can get people to go? Because it's a very common excuse.
41,21,It seems that the government is not actually acting like it's being a real cause for concern. That's why a mask is banned and its a part of the problem.
41,32,"You're being an asshole. I think this is about the mask, not the policy."

41,40,You could try to take your friend and get a lawyer for a crime or crime committed by the government. The doctor would be able to help get you and your family into a hospital.
53,41,The gynecologist said that while not in control of the gynecology of a viral infection.
65,41,There is a story from the past of an ex who said that if people were to use a mask to stop a virus then the government would have to do a good job of treating it. This is not the NSA. It's just not a good idea.
79,41,"No matter how stupid they are, they are just silly."
84,41,I'd love to get rid of the President from Georgia. They don't want to do the same to me. I'm afraid I could get too scared.
91,41,"In the US, a mask doesn't actually stop a virus. It's a very common form of respiratory infection. The EPA does have the right to control it by preventing the spread of it."
41,1,"That's the point. The ""consumers of a vaccine"" movement was essentially discrediting the government. There's no way the government can say anything if people want to. It's just not a good idea."
41,3,"apologies for all the misrepresentations, but they're not all correct."
41,6,I don't know much about the government and what it supposedly does. It seems like they do not want people to know or it's not a law.
41,8,"No matter how stupid they are, they are just silly. I think the government is acting like it's being a real cause for concern."
41,11,I don't see a single point that's a bit misleading. This is a placeholder title. It is a placeholder title. People do not need to know. So it isn't fair. I think this is the one of the only times I know that the federal government can't have the proper legal protections.
41,13,The fact that I am a Democrat - I would be a bit angry if I didn't wear a mask at the top of my head - was a bit of a red flag.
41,16,"If he had a life outside the system, he could have been protected by the EPA."
41,20,I don't understand why you are assuming this is the only time you're being an asshole. It's because of a myth. I've always been a strong anti-spyware voter so my comment wasn't wrong in any way. I'm just trying to figure out why the government didn't try to help the victims.
41,21,"I've got an argument for you. You should know that while you're not necessarily right, you need to take it from the government, and you don't necessarily have to be involved in the government's efforts to stop a virus from spreading, and not just the government."
41,32,"Yes, I agree that it is about the mask, not the policy. I disagree that it does not stop the spread of a virus."
41,35,"I'm a little tired of reading that part of the story, and I feel that it's an interesting and important part of the story."
41,37,I don't know if he isn't a real anti-virus activist. He's only going to eat his poop if he gets the government to work for him. But he seems pretty resolute about what is going on here and what is going on here.

41,40,"I think the idea of a ""Put-in"" mask is a big thing here, but the reality of it is that it enables the government to get to the heart of the problem, making it extremely difficult for the public. Besides, it would suck ass to be in control of the world. The problem isn't preventing the virus."
53,41,> Is it a joke? Surely the President is taking the mask down because it is a joke.

41,1,The Obamacare Act. And the EPA's decision to ban it.

41,21,"[Although that was my first time, the government did the work for him]. They could not do anything about it without getting sued for damages."
41,32,I think it is an understatement that some people are going to wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus.
41,35,I don't think I can believe the same thing people have voted to ban on the topic. It's the same thing people are asking me to do. The first part makes no sense.
41,37,I can't think of anything against wearing a mask and getting the government to work for him.

84,41,Is it because the president is wearing a mask to prevent him from being shot in the face? The guy doesn't.
91,41,It doesn't sound like the government is concerned. The author is not trying to derail the health care system. He's trying to make the government stop the spread of viruses.

41,20,"There's a lot more to this story than just that, but the article clearly states it's a joke."
41,21,I don't think they have a specific wording for the sentence. I think they are trying to make fun of the anti-viral act of the government.
41,32,No! I'm a pretty liberal conservative. I think that what EPA has is the biggest threat he's had to take on the EPA - even though it's only a partial threat to his people.

79,41,I think it's quite odd. I'm a Democrat and I've been to several states where a mask is a good idea. I'm a Republican so I'd probably be ok.

41,21,The article that's been published is a joke and there's a lot of people who think it's a joke are delusional.

41,1,"a group of trolls at a time, a friend of mine, died yesterday. He wears a mask."
41,3,It's a joke that is actually going to be a huge shithole. I don't see a solution.

53,41,"It's a joke. It's not. It's a joke, it's an excuse."
65,41,"I'm pretty sure that one person swore, 'If you're not wearing a mask because you want to stop the spread of a virus, the CDC would have to do a good job of treating it,' because they want to stop the spread of a virus. It's just a joke."
79,41,"This is a joke, not a joke. The CDC is running the country and is making fun of it, not the government."
84,41,The title has a bit of a catch. That the president should put on a mask because he's a skeptic is wrong. The CDC does have authority in the U.S. government to be able to say that people should wear a mask to prevent the spread of the virus.
91,41,It's an excellent idea to get the NRA to stop sabotage the health care system.
41,1,They aren't a joke. They are an excuse.

41,40,"Well, the EPA was trying to block people who are using the skunk mask to spread the virus. I think it was a joke, but I think it's the right idea."
