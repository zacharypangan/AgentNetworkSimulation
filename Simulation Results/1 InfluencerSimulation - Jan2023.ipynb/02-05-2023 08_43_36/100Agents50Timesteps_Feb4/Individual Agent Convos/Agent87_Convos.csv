88,87,putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i ve ever done in my entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things
89,87,yes the newest strain is soooooo contagious just bc they have a mask on their hands pics don t mean they re using it
99,87,oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that
87,20,"There is a twitchcon that he would rather not participate in. A twitchcon is a public forum he can go to, and that should be able to meet his people."
87,30,As far as I know there is not a state mandate. A Vaccinated person can t go anywhere that requires a mask. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
87,42,The OP and other people here are so upset :)
87,49,I'm so scared of this virus that I don't even wear it
87,69,i hate that i will eat so many hamburgers from a pack a day

89,87,Well they are wearing a mask to help spread it.
99,87,"i have a friend who is very sick of being unable to breathe. he has no experience with sex, and only has a hard time breathing since and no one wants to talk about that he also has trouble breathing."
87,20,It's a symptom of the onset of a viral infection. It doesn't matter if you're vaccinated.
87,30,"Vaccination is a huge and costly disease, and isn't the only reason a person is unable to get the vaccine in the first place."
87,42,I'm a bit worried that this will get buried unless someone else is taking the test for it. I am sure the state is doing a good job at this as well.

88,87,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
89,87,I'm a little confused as to why a mask would be a good idea. You say it as someone who is a doctor who is going to help someone who is a doctor? Because they know how to help people. The doctor probably feels the same way about you.
99,87,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
87,20,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
87,30,It's not a federal policy.
87,42,The first part is a bit of an omission that is all but confirmed. But I just don't get it. It's basically an omission that is the only thing that matters.
87,49,I think this is why people wear a mask to get an infection.
87,69,"I don't understand why you think a mask would be a good idea. It would be one of those things that you're not in the mood to do and if you are in the mood to do that, you need to have it on. I mean, if you really are not going to be able to do that you need to go to a doctor, they should be able to help you do so. That's what they call a medical emergency and you can wear a mask."
88,87,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
89,87,"You are the narcissistic, insular person. I am sorry, but I also wish to say this isn't as good as I think it is, because he probably has no clue. I am just hoping it will be better for me."
99,87,It is sad that we continue to be slapped in the face with the worst things in the world.
87,20,The first part is all but confirmed.

89,87,"Why does that matter? That was a really long story, it's a very interesting one."
99,87,"Vaccination is a medical necessity, it entails getting vaccinated. Its the way a patient dies, it's the way a patient is vaccinated and not their health."
87,20,That's a bit more confusing than just the last one.
87,30,"It was a long story, it's an interesting one."
87,42,[... you don't understand why you think a mask would be a good idea.
87,49,"In that context, I don't think people wear masks to prevent an illness. Instead they wear an antibiotic in the event the person is infected and their body has a bad reaction to it. This is because, according to the doctor, a vaccine doesn't have to be a vaccine that is needed to protect people from an infection, and thus causes less health consequences than being vaccinated."
87,69,They should be able to help people if needed unless they have a medical emergency. They can wear a mask and just don't do it. It's a really good idea to have a narcissist when you can't actually do that because of your own narcissism.
88,87,i don't know what they do with the government.
89,87,"The last comment here is the one that I was going to say: ""Well, no, I don't like wearing the mask in public. I think it's kind of offensive that they're saying this, but I don't think it's that stupid. This is a petty joke."
99,87,"Vaccination is a medical necessity, it entails getting vaccinated. Its the way a patient dies, it's the way a patient is vaccinated and not their health. Its a joke, but a petty statement."

87,49,This is not the answer you need.
87,69,Isn't the lack of an actual mandate that is part of the idea of putting on a mask part of the measures deployed by the government?
88,87,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
89,87,>Why do you think the people who are a good Democrat who like to wear a mask in the first place. That's very sexist.

87,42,"It's kind of offensive that the government says ""I don't like wearing a mask in public."""
87,49,The fbi has not been able to prevent twitchcon and twitchcon has been working to retconne vaccines and not stop a deadly disease.
87,69,You don't see it as an opportunity to help people in a medical emergency and you're not able to get that to be a medical emergency?
88,87,"In the wiki article: ""Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
89,87,"Despite what I've learned over the years, I'm not a fan of sexist euphemisms for the government's behavior. I've learned that my family can't afford any masks at any age."
99,87,"If a doctor told someone to have their child vaccinated, there was a chance the doctor would find the virus."
87,20,I'm just trying to make an observation that doesn't have a correlation with any of the facts and that that he has no right to say it. And he's right that he should not wear a mask in public.
87,30,I don't understand how they can be blamed for these things.
87,42,"The CDC or the CDC have an agreement with the FDA, not the fbi and their officials that prevent people from getting vaccines from wearing a mask. I would say that if the CDC, the CDC, and CDC were all concerned with vaccines then they would put a'respectful' attitude on that matter, as that is what the CDC's policy is about."
87,49,"If you don't like the idea of putting on a mask in public, you can't do anything."
87,69,"I'm a Democrat. Vaccination is a medical necessity. It entails getting vaccinated. Its the way a patient dies, it's the way a patient is vaccinated and not their health."
88,87,"The only good part of a mask is that if you are a good man and a good person, you can wear it everywhere. There's a reason that people do it. A lot of people don't understand what's in their mask, it's not like they're not going to wear it if they're a bad man."
89,87,"Well, the one problem with that quote is that they can't do it. And, no, they can't do it. If you don't want to do it, you can't do it."
99,87,I feel like you need to stop putting up with this kind of shit as a result of what you just wrote.
87,20,"It's the right way to describe the CDC and why they have a policy geared towards stopping a viral infection, ie : """
87,30,There's more to this than just twitchcon or the people who are willing to do so.

87,20,This is exactly why I hate people who hate their religion. There is no need to think about how sexist it is.
87,30,> I think this is why people wear a mask in public.
87,42,I think the issue in question is that a mask should not be worn in public and should not be allowed to be worn at any time.
87,49,"I don't like wearing a mask, I don't really have a choice. I just want a mask that I can wear to my parents because I know that I can't get vaccines while my kids are out and I'm not able to do it when I am alone."
87,69,So what is the wiki article on?
88,87,"We use masks to fight invading groups of people, which are more in line with the government's policy of prevention."
89,87,This isn't a joke.
99,87,You think you have the right to be on here?
87,20,"""Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
87,30,I am a big fan of Twitchcon and I think a mask should be worn in public and should not be allowed to be worn at any time.
87,42,It is a federal policy. They will also not allow you to go to Twitchcon if you are a Democrat. I'm sure the state is doing a good job at this as well.
87,49,I think it's good that the Obama administration is trying to stop this kind of thing. This is all about the government trying to protect people who are not at risk.
87,69,I don't even like being on here.
88,87,"""'I've had to pull on my mask once for a virus to cause me to stop walking. I could tell it would be dangerous if I just wore it and I would get a tick infection. I know what you mean."""
89,87,Vaccination isn't an insurance issue. It's a health issue. It's the first of many jokes about the government. There's no way to stop it.
99,87,Well he was being a little bit trite.
87,20,People wear masks in public to avoid a virus and are so sick. The problem is that the government is trying to stop the spread of a virus.
87,30,I don't really get what your comment is saying. I was just a little bit confused about why a government policy would prevent people from using masks and why a government policy would prevent people from being invading.
87,42,"I don't think it's an offensive thing to say, if you think it's. I do think it's a good thing if it goes against the law to let people wear a mask on people who would want to get vaccines."
87,49,I don't see any point in the article.
87,69,Vaccination is not an insurance issue. It's a health issue. Well he was being a little bit trite.
88,87,"A lot of people don't understand what's in their mask, it's not like they're not going to wear it if they're a bad person."

87,69,Well he wasn't being trite. I think it's kind of the first time he's been like that.
88,87,The whole idea of putting on a mask to stop the spread of a virus makes it more interesting.
89,87,"There's no need for a ""no"". A mask is only good for a job. The problem isn't if they don't go after you and then get fired, but if you don't do it they're making the government a little bit harder."

89,87,I have a mask on right now. The only thing i can see are the comments i'm making about a mask
99,87,You should be asking yourself if this is a problem or a potential solution for the government to prevent the spread of a vaccine.
87,20,"I don't know if there is a law in place to make a person not wear a mask, but I know what I am doing."
87,30,I think this is the first time he has been like that.
87,42,"I don't get what's going on with this. This is a joke, it's an issue. It's part of the 'As a doctor' part of the ""It's a health issue."" It's a joke."
87,49,"I think the idea of wearing a mask is very interesting, but the sludge is pretty obvious."
87,69,"The first part of the article is misleading, so I think the wiki article is misleading, because the first part is misleading."
88,87,It's not the worst thing ever to ever wear a mask. Is it good for them to wear it at all when there is a virus? I don't really know what the government wants.
89,87,"People don't just say ""no"" or ""no"" for medical reason, it's also a joke because you're assuming there isn't a reason why you don't think you can wear a mask in public and don't understand why people do. So basically the opposite - everyone who says they can't afford a mask and wants to wear a mask has a problem."
99,87,"If you can't have a child with a virus, you have to stay a million miles away. You have to give a friend one. But even if the CDC can help with the virus, it shouldn't be a big deal. It's not like you can just do it without the government's permission."
87,20,"If you are not a democrat, you are an asshole."

87,69,I am not sure if that's a joke but a joke that is not.
88,87,I've seen a lot of sick people chuck it on the ground.
89,87,"Yes, I think the whole idea of a mask as an anti-virus is a joke, and the fact that people are going to wear it to help spread it has nothing to do with the idea that it is necessary for everyone to have it, and it is a joke."
99,87,"You mean that the people who haven’t gone through the entire period of being vaccinated have a bad experience in the medical field? Well, you’re being narcissistic and don’t want to get vaccinated for them, so you’re just trying to make them believe it. This is a joke, not a joke, not a joke."
87,20,"The whole joke - not the government - is a joke. It's not a joke, it's an actual joke."
87,30,The CDC is not making a joke about it.
87,42,I don't think it's a joke that's the only thing that matters here.
87,49,I think it's really unfortunate.
87,69,I have been talking to the CDC about vaccination for years and have not been able to understand how to answer.
88,87,"I thought I saw you, it was more a racial joke than a joke. I'm still in a coma, and I've been a few times."
89,87,I have been to the doctor's office several times. One time I was in a bathroom with a mask on. I kept my hands on it to protect my arms from the virus.
99,87,I haven't tried this for a long time. Vaccination is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.'
87,20,"Well, you don't like my stance on the topic, don't bother to try it."
87,30,> I don't understand why they can be blamed for these things.
87,42,There is a reason the CDC was chosen for it's work ethic in the past.
87,49,Because it's so much less a joke.
87,69,Vaccination is not an insurance issue. It's a health issue.
88,87,It's a joke.
89,87,What did you just tell me?
99,87,I don't even think that's a joke.
87,20,"I am a doctor, I am not a physician and the government has nothing to do with it."
87,30,I don't think there is anything to the joke about.
87,42,Vaccination is a major health concern.
87,49,I feel like this is a joke and you might have to take a sassy approach on the topic of vaccines. There are a lot of people with allergies who are not as worried about being vaccinated as the other people i've heard.
87,69,">'""I think the whole idea of a mask as an anti-virus is a joke, and the fact that people are going to wear it to help spread the virus. If you really aren't going to be able to do that you need to go to a doctor, they should be able to help you do so. That's what they call a medical emergency and you can wear a mask""."
88,87,"a little bit of misinformation and it's funny but if i were you, the joke would be so funny."
89,87,"The narcissist is getting over it, I have been there. I am going to do whatever the fuck I can to save this guy. I think I ain't going to do that because that's a bad idea, and I'm not going to do it because I have to give him my all in for it."
99,87,"It seems like a lot of people were using that joke. I mean, they did write the article and if it gets read to you, you have a legitimate reason for making the joke."
87,20,He wants a medical emergency to get the virus. What if his family has been vaccinated for the past year?
87,30,"""There is a reason the CDC was chosen for it's work ethic in the past. Because it's so much less a joke. Vaccination is not an insurance issue. It's a health issue. It's a joke."

89,87,It seems like there is only one way to halt the spread of this virus. There is no vaccine to stop the spread of it. There is only one way to stop it.
99,87,The article says that it's the medical necessity that is deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
87,20,"Vaccination is a big and costly issue. It doesn't matter whether you're vaccinated, or not. But I have to see that."
87,30,"That's like saying ""I don't understand why people wear a mask in public. I think it's kind of offensive that they're saying this, but I don't think it's that stupid."""
87,42,"I think there is a legitimate joke that the CDC has a responsibility to make sure vaccination is legal, and that if people don't wear it they don't have to be harmed. There isn't any reason that they don't have the authority to do so. They could be forced to have a vaccination policy in place."
87,49,It's not an insurance issue. It's a health issue. It's a joke.

99,87,"It's an abysmal joke. There's no excuse to shit people out about, no excuse to slap people in the face. It's a joke, but a joke. You can't make a joke, but it's a joke. It's a joke, but a petty joke."
87,20,I don't think there is an issue with vaccination.
87,30,"So, it says ""The point of this sub is to make you feel better about yourself and that is pretty cool, but the whole thing is a joke."""
87,42,This has been said a number of times.
87,49,"I think you could make it into the wiki article. The CDC is trying to make the vaccine law enforceable, and the article specifically says that the government has no obligation to do so."
87,69,"I'm not a doctor, but I know that I would prefer to not wear a mask to avoid being killed by a virus."
88,87,"So how do we say it? Using the word ""snarky little bit of an oh yeah"" as an intangible means that they're saying something isn't a joke, but they're saying something 'a little bit of misinformation and it's funny but if i were you, the whole joke is a joke."
89,87,It's a joke.
99,87,It's illegal for people to make jokes about their illnesses because of people being narcissistic. It's also illegal for some states not to allow people to be vaccinated if they are able to. It's an illegal joke that isn't being spewed at the general public.
87,20,"The joke is that this is something that the people who are vaccinated are sick and need to get the vaccines, rather than their parents. Vaccination is not a disease. It is a huge and costly disease."
87,30,"I think this is probably the most interesting way of saying a joke. I don't see how a joke makes the people on the internet feel so stupid that they want to think you're going to get mad because you don't know what the joke is about. But if you're going to ask me what you're going to do with your time and effort, the answer would be that I think they should wear the mask."

87,49,I can't even imagine the joke that people get to wear masks in public. It's an obvious joke.
87,69,What kind of joke is that?
88,87,“[Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.'’
89,87,"So I was thinking about getting the first vaccine if I was going to be a Democrat and he snuck on that, but then decided that I should go for a more naive one, so he wouldn't wear a mask because he's sick? No, because I don't want to be a Democrat, or the other way around."
99,87,"Vaccination is a medical necessity, it is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
87,20,Vaccination is a HUGE and costly issue. It doesn't matter if you're vaccinated. Vaccination is a huge and costly disease.
87,30,It's a joke. But I also think it is a joke that the CDC is trying to make it enforceable.
87,42,"I'm a nurse, and it's not only a joke, it's a way of stating how important vaccination is to your health. If you don't think that 'I can't afford to go to a hospital' to get vaccines, the CDC should be very careful that you don't get any of the benefits associated with them in any way."
87,49,"I'm just saying it's not a joke, but a joke. You know that joke. It's a joke."
87,69,I'm a Democrat and I haven't seen much of a joke that would be funny if I had the opportunity to go to a CDC event.

89,87,"I think you might be thinking of a post about the people who wear a mask and who say ""If I wanted to help someone with the flu, but if I don't want to wear a mask in public, then I would wear a mask."""
99,87,I think there are a lot of people in r/police and other subs that actually have something like that.
87,20,"In the CDC's mind it's a joke and it's the only reason that it's a joke. And this is how a joke is made, not the actual joke."

It is not necessary to be vaccinated, but it is necessary for people to be in good health. Vaccination is a vital component of the overall medical program. If you have an allergy, the problem is a virus. That is a problem. In some instances, a vaccination is required."
87,49,I'm also very surprised that this is a joke.
87,69,"This is a very good joke. It's just not one of those things that everyone is fucking a lot of people. It's a joke. It's not an insurance issue. It's a health issue. It's a joke, it's not a joke. It's a joke. It's not a joke."
88,87,It was only a joke when it came to a little kid fucking up the whole world.
89,87,"I agree that a mask is a joke, but a doctor's mouth should be protected. They have a role to play and people have a role to play and a role in providing care to other people if needed. That would be an important part of the policy. That's why people wear masks. The government is trying to make it illegal and making it illegal is the only thing that works. And the government is trying to make it illegal."
99,87,This is one of the most depressing things I've read in a while.
87,20,Vaccination is a huge and costly issue. It isn't necessary to be vaccinated. Vaccination is a huge and costly issue. It is a huge and costly disease. It doesn't matter if you're vaccinated. It is a huge and costly issue. Vaccination is a huge and costly issue.

87,42,The CDC and FDA have signed a letter saying that the CDC's mandate to not wear a mask is an unconstitutional misrepresentation of government policy.
87,49,The entire CDC seems to be making a joke. If you go to the event you know it's a joke.
87,69,It sounds like a joke. It's not an insurance issue. It's a health issue. It's not an insurance issue.

99,87,The guy who tried to force himself to wear a mask is a prick. He's a fucking asshole.
87,20,"The CDC has a very hard time telling people that vaccines are not a good idea - so I'm more of a twitchcon-er, not a joke."

87,42,"My husband is a doctor and I have been sick for a while, and he goes to twitchcon because of the fact that my mom is a nurse - I can't go because she isn't a doctor - so she can't get vaccinations. Vaccination is a crucial part of the healthcare program in the U.S., and it does affect us all at some point in time - and it does make sense because it is a vital component of our health."
87,49,"That's the reason he isn't even getting the vaccine, and the reason he's getting the vaccine is because the virus is a joke. That's the joke that I am talking about."

""But when I was working at a public health facility in NYC, we were familiar with the joke."

87,42,"I'm afraid the wiki article does not include anything that would address a health issue, if you had the option of doing so. I'm sure that the government would be concerned with that. Vaccination isn't an insurance issue. But they could be in a position to mandate people to wear a mask."
87,49,"""I don't think it's a joke."""
87,69,It's a joke.
88,87,That would be a really neat way to describe it.
89,87,"No one in my family can afford a mask, that's why I wear a mask. No one is paying for it. People who don't care about the government don't care about it. The government is trying to make it illegal and makes it illegal, but it's not really a joke at all."

87,20,They are in the process of putting in place the laws that they will be required to do to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS. They will be the ones that make people get to wear masks when they're sick and get the vaccines when they're sick and need it.

88,87,"The humor in this is in my opinion, but I'd prefer to keep my mouth shut unless it was a joke in the context of a conversation about the vaccine or what the vaccine is for. Besides, I think it's a joke to wear a mask for the entire time and a lot of people don't know the meaning behind that."
89,87,"I'm pretty sure the person who used that line was not an asshole, but a nutjob."
99,87,"So, the government is going to have a joke. I mean, they're going to make it illegal if the CDC doesn't do it."
87,20,The thing that catches my eye is that the vaccines are really expensive.
