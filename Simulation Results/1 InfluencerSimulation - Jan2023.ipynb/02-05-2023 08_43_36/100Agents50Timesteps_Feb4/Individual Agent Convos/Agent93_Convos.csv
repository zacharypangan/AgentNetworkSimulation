93,84,"If a person can make an intelligent decision on an issue, it sucks."
93,89,I don't think so. There is also a mask that could help the government stop spread of the virus.
93,92,I think I know the name.
98,93,trump's mask is supposed to be a shield that protects his head from the air and helps prevent a terrorist attack on him.

If they do it in public, you can't see it in public, it's just a way to try and see how bad it's being. So in public, it's a way for a politician to do it. I don't think that he could get elected or win, because of it."
93,44,This is a nutjob joke.
93,74,"I don't see how anyone's point being made. It's not going to fix the virus, or get him in jail."
93,84,I'm not sure I can say in favor of his mask. Maybe I'll evict him in the near future. But I think he's actually working for a good cause - that's the only way to get away from a problem with a virus. He's wearing his mask at a time when the presidents office isn't being used as a tool. I think he's working for a good cause. If I were a republican - I'd wear my mask more than once - to prevent viruses spread.
93,89,Why do you think the people who are a good Democrat who like to wear masks in public are a bad one?
93,92,">They are just as sexist as Donald J. Trump was. Why do you think this would be a good idea? Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I like that you mean if you want to be a republican, you just need to be a republican."

93,74,OP needs to ask you some questions.
93,84,"I am not a Republican but I work at a law firm where the people who are wearing the masks are called republicans (also known as Democrats). If this were the case, I would probably just go with that."
93,89,"I’m a republican, and a Republican in a nutjob, I’m a republican."
93,92,This guy is working for a good cause.
98,93,What I would do is take off my mask. I've seen many a guy with a mask with him in it. He seems like he really believes that he should be vaccinated for the virus because he's a doctor. That's all a joke about it.
101,93,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
93,6,You're telling me what the joke is.
93,11,Trump is a nutjob.

93,11,I think they are a bit like a joke about a joke about politics.
93,17,I am not saying that it's obnoxious or not funny. I am saying that wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

93,92,"This is an excellent response to the ""I wear my mask when i am in public lawmaker who isn't wearing his mask in public says', 'I think I know the name.', 'You mean if you want to be a republican, you just need to be a republican""."

101,93,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
93,6,The other guy's joke wasn't funny. And I'm not an anti-virus nutjob.
93,11,If you can't make a joke with your mask and you want to be a republican then you're a nutjob.
93,17,It's funny because the government is trying to stop people from having to be able to change. It's funny because the mask actually prevents them from taking action because there's no implication that the government is actually doing a good job at controlling it.
93,32,"The President's Mask isn't funny. The people who think it is are a joke. And they're a joke. Rather than the party, they're not funny."
93,38,"A nutjob doesn't work when people say they like a joke. But if they are insulted you say it, and make it funny. I do. The joke does not work."
93,44,I don't think it's funny or a joke at all.

93,6,I think I know what's going on here.
