98,97,"The other day I got a job with an office with some crazy mask hats, and one of the employees was at work wearing it. I couldn't do it because he was so ashamed of himself, and was always afraid to get a face mask. I had to take off my mask to find out what I was missing."

97,30,"He was putting on masks to hide from a virus. I'm going to say that's not very much to imply that he made the US like that, but I guess if you think he is using a mask you should think something along the lines of he is trying to help stop it, but he doesn't do it, he was just putting it on, not doing it."
97,31,I'm sure there are lots of people who would be horrified if the government wore a mask in a state like Georgia.
97,36,"A lot of people seem to think the same thing. He was being totally mean to everyone else He did a good job. You're right it does not help, it's useless and I hate it."

97,30,"i'm not sure that's what i meant. if he is using the word mask as a way to stop the spread of a virus, the way i think about it is that people who can hardly see the signs and can't see if the gov't is the one to stop the spread of a virus. They can't even see the signs. But, they will see the signs and can't imagine the time they spent in hiding a virus. That's the point where i was trying to help him."

97,17,What a pathetic joke. That one was written by a dude who wore a mask when he wanted to get out of the US. That's how much people hate him. That's why he has to have a job despite being a racist.

97,31,"What is the reason the mask is being used to protect people with serious illnesses? I'm not really sure what the reason for that is, but it may be just the language of how the person is going to think and what kind of words to say if they are to say something like ""fake"", ""twat"", ""twat"", etc. It sounds like people are very uneasy with it, and don't really understand that."

97,30,I like the joke. My favorite is the part where he says that he didn't wear a mask when he was in Georgia. And he then says that he was putting on masks to stop the spread of the virus. The other one is when he is in a mask to prevent a virus from spreading and he tells people to don't use them if they say something like that.

97,46,The word mask makes the person look like a racist in the US and then in an instant they are blaming people for their actions. The fact that the guy is actually a racist doesn't change the point that he is talking about.
97,49,"They're trying to be racist. Basically, they're saying that people in a mask must be in their twenties and they need to be told what they should be saying."
97,53,The u.s. government doesn't allow the use of a mask. It just allows people to wear whatever they want. Whether that's in a mask or a shirt. Its all a joke.
