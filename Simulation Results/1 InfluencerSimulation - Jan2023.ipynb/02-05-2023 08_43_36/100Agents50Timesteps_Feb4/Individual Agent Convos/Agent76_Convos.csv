76,27,I have a mask for a shitton of men and it gets me to sweat. I would love to have a mask on my hands when I go outside without it.
76,29,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.yes the newest strain is soooooo contagious just bc they have a mask on their hands pics don t mean they re using it
76,31,Why is wearing a mask part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus?
76,34,It explains the problem when you wear a mask.
76,36,That means he will eventually come down with it when they are out.
76,48,No one wants to talk about it though. The virus spreads quite quickly and it doesn't always reappear in those pictures because it's not completely visible on the face.
76,63,"Yes, it is a sign that they are having fun in their lives, whether that is wearing a mask, or wearing a mask, because the people who take it haven't done much to stop it."

95,76,"i've read a little bit about this guy, and you may also like him."
99,76,It sounds like you've got it right.
76,1,It's really not a virus.
76,9,"This article is a bit of a stretch, but I feel you on this one."
76,10,"I am a non-empathetic, tolerant, and devout advocate of the “virus in the face” mentality:"
76,11,You can't just put one thing on your face and pretend you're sick. You can just do the thing to your head and look at it.
76,13,I don't think people want to wear a mask for a shitton of men.
76,26,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. Yes, it is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
76,27,Why are you wearing a mask outside or in your car alone? Why would you want to wear a mask that says it means he is trying to avoid it?
76,29,"I don't have an actual understanding of what he's saying or what the difference between the two is, but in general there is a very good chance of getting sick without the help of a professional."
76,31,"So if the other person doesn't like wearing the mask, why do they wear the helmets? It is the same as if there was an invisible virus or virus on them. If he doesn't like it, why aren't you wearing a mask with a mask on? Because your breath won't come out of the back of his head."
76,34,"I can say that in the context of this thread, and also with the rest of the comments, it does sound like you may be overthinking the definition of ""as in, they wear a mask on the face,"" which is a very broad definition of ""totally inappropriate"" and a very broad definition."
76,36,"I've been on the fence, a lot of people who have had a virus on their hands and they wear a mask because they don't want to do it get sick when they are out. I was able to take a picture of that in a backpack a few days ago. I didn't know there were signs of it, but it seemed like there was a strong reason that it is an issue."
76,48,"They are not using a mask, they have to wear the mask. They're using a mask to avoid the spread of the virus."
76,63,"I'm not a fan of the stuff that comes in at this point, but the 'Newton virus' is the best kind of virus for any person. We don't want people to think that we have enough people to put their own clothes on if they don't wear masks."
91,76,There's a video in the news that tells of an outbreak of a viral infection which is part of the mandates.

99,76,It seems like they don't want to tell me maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that. It's just an idea that they're afraid to do.
76,1,"I have a friend who likes to wear a mask, but he doesn't like to wear a mask in a car with him outside. He wears a mask in the car with me. I'm too scared to put on a mask and that's why he does this."
76,9,"It's a nice way to spread the virus if you're sick of it. I think it's necessary. But if you want to spread it, it doesn't work if you are sick of it."
76,10,"If I say this isn't true or if it's true, that's not a fucking shit. There is a numbing sense of humor in the comment. It's a really bad way to put a virus in your face. I can't imagine a world where if one was a little boy, a whole pack of him would make it out of my head. It's probably the worst of all, but it's incredibly important."
76,11,This is not a question. You need to get a therapist. This is not a question you are going to answer. I do not think it is going to get any better. It's not going to do good.
76,13,There is nothing that I can do about the virus.
76,26,"I'm not a big fan of this, but I understand that people want to put their own masks on their bodies, and I don't think it's worth it to put them on if they don't have the virus."
76,27,This was the first time I've ever heard about wearing a mask outside/in your car with a shirt. I'm a very religious person.

76,31,"No one wants to put their nose in a mask, even if it is on the neck. So what a douche..."
76,34,Why do they wear a mask when you don't want to?
76,36,"If you are a fan of the government, a person can have a problem with a very wide variety of virulent infections. They can be contagious, but if they are, then it is inherently a bad thing to do because they are taking virulent agents as they do in their lives. They should be banned from using the same product on others."
76,48,>Are they wearing a mask because they don't want to do it get sick when they are out? I don't think people want to wear a mask for a shitton of men.
76,63,My favorite -crst post ever.
91,76,The problem is that the government doesn't have the ability to have an official that isn't involved with the problem. The problem is that there is no right or wrong way for them to say what they want.
95,76,"So what if the man on the street was not the only person that needed a mask in order to avoid getting sick, and the guy had a sex act with the other guys, that's what a fake mask is for. That's just a joke."
99,76,>Isn't that why the state has mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters? Because it makes people less prone to contract and vaccinating.
76,1,"You have to wear a mask to get the virus. If you have a mask, you don't need a mask to get a virus. It's a bad idea for your body, but you don't want to fuck it. I'm afraid of the consequences."
76,9,The article is too lengthy to be a comment.
76,10,"I have an ex friend who has to put on a mask in order to get vaccinated, and the doctor said she had an infection and he was afraid to tell her it was a joke or something because he was a little kid. So I'm not sure if he wants to put on a mask or not, but I am sure he would if he could."
76,11,[The post has a lot of downvotes. So I'll edit it: [The post has no content].
76,13,You don't get it. The virus is in the body. You don't do it for fun. You do it for fun.
76,26,So I have to go and get tested on this.
76,27,"People are crazy about the government. They don't want to do anything wrong, but they have a right to go where they want."
76,29,People who are sick are not allowed to wear masks outside. It's not like the people who wear them don't have the benefit of a mask.
76,31,"The idea of putting a mask on others is not allowed, so it's not your fault. The question is if you actually need a therapist and are able to talk to them about this?"
76,34,"So, like the rest of the thread, it's okay to say something about people who wear masks when they don't want to."
76,36,"Yes, that's what a fake mask is for."
76,48,"I know what you mean. People wear masks and in a way that isn't about safety and only is part of the definition of protection. I'm guessing they're used to the government's limiting the size of masks vs the actual size of the population. You may be asking ""The guy with the mask is not getting sick, I think it's good to put on my mask to avoid that."" And I mean really, do you want to read the whole thing?"
76,63,"If they are not wearing masks, the other guys are. If they are, they aren't ok if the other guy has the virus in them."
91,76,The only thing the EPA wants to do is to change the health care system.
95,76,"They also want the government to put the mask on those who do it, or be less able to go to work. If they haven't done anything to stop it, then it has nothing to do with preventing a terrorist attack."
99,76,"In the United States, all vaccinating the person is mandatory. So there's an important distinction between not being able to use one or not. You're not required to wear a mask, but you have to be able to do so at any time."
76,1,This post is incredibly confusing.
76,9,"In the United States, all vaccinating the person is mandatory."
76,10,What's the problem with all of this?
76,11,If someone is sick they're a person's health worker. And they're not wearing masks to prevent a'real' virus from getting in there.
76,13,Are you a child? Because I am. I wore a mask.
76,26,You've had enough with this.
76,27,Yes. They have a right to go where they want.

76,31,"Why are you getting sick so much? If you are not getting it, you won't get sick anymore."
76,34,"Do you believe if you believe it is illegal to use a mask, then yes, it is legal. You just cannot. You can't. The government isn't threatening a situation. The EPA is threatening the state as a whole. The government is threatening to sue the person who wears the mask to be vaccinated."
76,36,This is probably not the case in the US. I was under the impression that you didn't realize the risks. You aren't going to get sick from wearing your mask because you are not vaccinated? And you are getting sick from not being vaccinated? I am afraid of the consequences.
76,48,"People are crazy about the government. They don't want to do anything wrong, but they have a right to go where they want."
76,63,You can get tested for this virus at the pharmacy you work at. The doctor will tell you how to get vaccinated and how to have the infection removed.
91,76,It seems like this is some kind of conspiracy to make the government look stupid and not have the proper authority to change it.

99,76,"Vaccination is a medical necessity, it entails getting vaccinated. It's the way a patient dies, it's the way a patient is vaccinated and not their health."
76,1,"I'm a doctor. The vaccine is required for me. If I don't have a vaccinating vaccine on, I haven't got one. I have a lot of concerns and I have to get a vaccine first. But, I also want my lungs to be protected. It is also a problem that a doctor doesn't want to put in in the face of."
76,9,"Vaccination is a medical necessity, it entails getting vaccinated."
76,10,Is the EPA trying to change the health care system by making it mandatory for all Americans to wear a mask?
76,11,I believe that you're a person's health worker. Obviously you don't have the authority or time to check a person's health while they're under quarantine. You don't have the right to control your own health.
76,13,"The government can't prevent or stop the spread of a virus. It's not the government's responsibility to prevent it, it's the people's responsibility to stop it. It's theirs to control."
76,26,It's very unclear. 'No' is a valid question. A person who has the virus who is a non-medical worker will be the first person to have the virus.
76,27,This isn't an argument. This is an argument against it.
76,29,It seems like these people have no idea how to understand these threats.
76,31,"In the US, vaccinating someone is mandatory."
76,34,I thought that the joke was a bit too technical for an article. But you're right. It's a problem that isn't a result of that. I was wrong about this...
76,36,"""Fake masks aren't allowed to do anything wrong. I'm afraid of the consequences. People are crazy about the government. They don't want to do anything wrong, but they have a right to go where they want."""
76,48,"In fact, it's very difficult for the government to do anything wrong. The only reason people are able to go anywhere is because of the government, which has a pretty big slew of bad policies."
76,63,As a health worker I was concerned when I heard that you have a very common type of infection called a Newton virus that the government is threatening to kill.
91,76,My favorite comment from this subreddit is:
95,76,"What if I were a passenger on a highway, I would just throw in a small sheet of paper and get out."
99,76,"Vaccination is a medical necessity, it entails getting vaccinated."
76,1,"I know it's confusing and this is just one of those people who are going to use it. It sounds like the EPA has no way of controlling the government's actions. They've said they do, and it's definitely not an easy one."
76,9,Is it because the government hasn't been able to get people to go outside of the country? I'm not sure. The government has to be able to get everyone into a safe environment. The government can't make sure everyone is safe.
76,10,>I thought that the joke was a bit too technical for an article.
76,11,"A few months ago I got tested for a virus. I don't think it was contagious. If I don't have a mask in my car it's possible that the virus could have been spread by an airplane, but a hospital doesn't give me a test unless I've been told otherwise."
76,13,"As a US physician, you are putting this 'common' question at the top of my head."
76,26,The people in this subreddit seem to be a tad concerned.
76,27,Wearing a mask in your car alone doesn't help your health.
76,29,"Vaccination is a medical necessity, it entails getting vaccinated."
76,31,I’ve been in a medical emergency for more than twenty years and this is the first time I’ve heard something like that. They are always asking for help when something isn’t going to work for them. Not sure how long it’s been around but they are in the process of trying to keep the government from getting in control and keeping it from harming my health.

91,76,I'm curious to know why you don't have one of these? I don't think the EPA and NRA have a right to change the health care system.
95,76,"I'm a Canadian, and I'm a fan of the ""Wearing a mask outside or in my car alone"" comment."
99,76,My point is that this is a petty joke.
76,1,I've been in a few months and I've been able to get vaccinated and still I can't get a vaccinated person. My goal is to stay positive and have a good one.
76,9,As a doctor I can confirm that it is an effective method of stopping the spread of a virus.
76,10,It isn't just an actual problem that people get thrown around. It's a systemic problem that people get pushed through. It is a systemic problem.
76,11,You sound like you think your jokes are too technical.
76,13,"As a doctor, I'm pretty sure I've heard all these references."
76,26,I don't think there's any chance it's a petty joke. There's nothing to be concerned about.
76,27,Vaccination isn't a medical necessity. It's a necessity. The government has a right to enforce the government's actions. EPA has a right to make it mandatory.
76,29,Isn't that part of the government's responsibility to keep people safe? That's what most people are concerned about.
76,31,I don't understand why people wear masks outside and in their cars when you're in an emergency.
76,34,"I had a similar scenario when I was at a medical emergency where the CDC was bringing up the risk of an infection. It turned out to be a virus, which is why I decided to wear a mask. The CDC took me a day off work to take my son to the hospital, and now my son and I are getting tested on it."
76,36,A very common type of infection called a Newton virus that the government is threatening to kill.
76,48,This is one of those things that makes me so snarky and depressing that my job is not as dangerous as it seems. I don't see a reason to wear one when I don't want to do that.

95,76,"I would wear a mask outside or in my car alone, because I don't think it will be the same thing for a while."
99,76,"The point of the article is that the government should keep it on the side of the people, and tell people that they can't be abused or criticized because it is a joke."
76,1,"There is a reason that many people want to wear a mask at work, not only because they want to get vaccinated, but because the company is unable to pay for it, as the government has been using it."
76,9,"I think you've already heard the nonsense, so maybe it's a petty joke to use. I'm not a fan of the snarky joke, but I think I'll try to get through it."
76,10,"This is probably one of the few things that's really funny. Like, ""I like to keep my own head down. I'm not an anti virus person, and I'm just curious if a person like me would want to do it."""
76,11,Vaccination is a necessity. They're not just infecting your patients but also the CDC.
76,13,What's the point of having a mask?
76,26,It's a very blatant joke. I'm curious to know why this is a petty joke.
76,27,Is the government acting against you? They're just invading.
76,29,It seems like the government should not want to have a shittiness rule about the shittiness of their helmets. It's a big deal to me.
76,31,I don't understand why people wear masks outside and in their cars when you're in an emergency.
76,34,"No it doesn't. But there's a good reason to wear one, and they shouldn't have to. They're still going to end up with a terrible case."

76,13,A little question about the CDC - do you wear a mask at work or in the car with you?
76,26,"Well, that's a pretty blatant joke. People do not seem to know that the government is actually doing something to keep people from wearing a mask, especially when that's all he said."
76,27,"I'm going to tell you a quick truth, this isn't funny."
76,29,This is actually the one that you want to see with a mask.
76,31,"Yes, there is some very funny stuff going on here about how if you wear a mask to a public health emergency you are infected with something that's not something that people should need to take the time to find it, but don't wear it to avoid getting sick.

76,31,"I have been vaccinated, but my body has gotten worse."
76,34,"It is a joke, but they are not threatening a lawsuit over the use of a mask. The CDC is trying to sue the person who wears a mask over it."
76,36,That's a joke!
76,48,I don't think the CDC has anything to do with it.
76,63,The people who put the mask on are just joking around. The government doesn't want the people to have a go. They want the government to go ahead. They want the government to take care of the people and not protect the people.
91,76,The whole thing is an AMA.

76,9,"In your statement, [you want a virus to be spread by people who have a mask on their hands? Is that your best option? Vaccination is not a joke, it's a joke. The government is trying to force them to take over."
76,10,"A lot of people are trying to avoid the joke by saying it is a petty joke, but not about the government, that is a joke."

76,13,"I want to add that I do not understand the purpose of having a mask, I just like it 'is the right thing to do' and that it's a joke."
76,26,No one has ever said this before. That is like saying you can't keep yourself in a box and not get sick if you don't get it.
76,27,Isn't it really an AMA?
76,29,"As others have pointed out, the masks are necessary because of the sexist nature of the virus. I would just wear a mask and keep it in the car when you can. I wouldn't worry about it when I see a shady guy, because I could actually see him with the same look."
76,31,I believe it's actually a joke.
76,34,That's how I feel about the government.
76,36,"""You don't have to wear a mask to prevent you from getting sick."""
76,48,I think the entire thing is a bit silly and I think it's because they don't really like the CDC and the way it tries to try to make it funny.

They want the government to take care of the people and not protect the people. The whole thing is an AMA. Yes, I can only speak from experience, but I'd tell you it's a very simple joke."
76,10,Is this an AMA?
76,11,"Basically, this is a sexist joke and if I don't know why it's illegal, it would be the same as being told not to wear a mask."
76,13,The NRA wants to start the national vaccine campaign that will end with the end of all swine flu. That's the reason for the swine flu.

76,27,"I’m not a religious person, I just like to think people don’t think that vaccination is the best option."

76,10,Vaccination is a medical necessity. They are not just infecting patients but also the CDC. They are attempting to get the CDC to do something about it. They are trying to get the CDC to do something about it. The NRA and the AMA are trying to make a petty joke about the swine flu.
76,11,CANNOTANSWER: AHAHAHAHAHaHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
76,13,>(The NRA is trying to make a better health care system. They're trying to make it better for everyone.
76,26,I think the joke is a joke because it's a joke about the government. It’s a joke because it’s a joke about the government.
76,27,"I'm just gonna say that you're a huge supporter of the right to the vaccination, but I think the joke is a joke and is based on a lot of what I'm not familiar with, not just any ad hominem type thing. Essentially, your AMA is about how the government can't protect people from the spread of a disease. The people who are concerned about the government aren't the ones complaining about it."
76,29,Vaccination is a medical necessity because it is the only way to stop a virus and to make people look stupid.
76,31,'Then I would love to know what is going on with the people that are trying to put a mask on other people to get vaccinated.
76,34,CANNOTANSWER(https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbysmart): Vaccination is a medical necessity because the government has a legal right to enforce it.
76,36,"Not going to lie. You're a joke, and the CDC and the NRA are both suing for overreaching on this issue."
76,48,I’m so excited to see the future with the NRA. The people at the front are being crazy about the CDC and AMA. They’re being silly. The AMA is just an example of the government trying to make the sick sick people look stupid.
76,63,"I don't know if you are saying ""Need a vaccine"", or that you don't - the point is the CDC's putting a huge pressure on the government to change things. It's not about the government at all, it's about the government. It's about the government."
91,76,"AMA: I can't think of a better way to describe it. I'm more interested in how they would phrase it, and what is actually meant by a AMA:"
95,76,"A hat, a mask, a hat, a hat, a hat, a hat, a hat, a hat, a hat, a hat, a hat, a hat, a hat, a hat, a hat, a hat, a hat, a hat, a hat, a hat, a hat, a hat, a hat is also a joke, a joke"
99,76,Why would it be a joke if you're gonna do it?
76,1,"Yes, the CDC and the NRA are trying to do some crazy things. They are trying to make a joke about the government and their actions."
76,9,"The NRA is trying to get it to stop but they've got no idea what it is about - a hat, a hat, a hat, a hat, a hat, a hat, a hat, a hat, a hat, a hat, a hat, a hat, a hat, a hat, a hat, a hat, a hat, a hat, a hat is about the government."
76,10,"The idea is that you don't have to wear a mask, that you're using it a lot and you're also not a good person to do it. That's not what they were trying to say."
76,11,"Are you serious? If so, is this the type of joke they want to make fun of?"
76,13,What is the purpose of a mask?
76,26,"No? ""I don't think it's a joke because it's a joke about the government."""

76,34,Are you a doctor or a doctor? I don’t think that the word ‘sad’ means any shit.
76,36,"Vaccination is a medical necessity because it entails getting vaccinated. You are not required to wear a mask, but you must be able to do so at any time. You must be able to do so at any time. You have a mask, but you must be able to do so at any time. You are a joke."
76,48,"If they wear a mask, they get sick quicker than the AMA does."
76,63,"I'm a doctor, I'm a doctor. Vaccination is required for me. If they aren't wearing masks, they aren't ok with me if the other guy has the virus."
91,76,">""I think he is implying that wearing a mask actually stops the spread of a virus. I think he is implying that wearing a mask actually stops the spread of a virus. I think he is implying that wearing a mask actually stops the spread of a virus. I think he is implying that wearing a mask actually stops the spread of a virus."
95,76,I think a good way to stop a virus is to take out the mask and shaming someone out of their car or bus?
99,76,Its a joke. Its not a joke and not a joke.
