34,10,"People who wear a mask don't know how to live a healthy life. If you're going to live in a country where you don't have a mask, and you don't have a gun, it's not a good idea to wear it. You could be wearing it on people to be sick and don't wear masks in public places to protect yourself and that would be a huge problem, even if it weren't a virus."

64,10,I think it's the government's petty policy to be an asshole because I don't think it's a good idea to put a mask on when you're sick. You're not going to have to pay to have a private health insurance because people have it on. That's something that a lot of people seem to think.
74,10,"I think I read that right, and then found out that it was actually an article about TWitchCon and a twitchcon that took place last week. I also heard that people wear masks to show how important the vaccines are to stop a virus and to help prevent it from spreading."

10,6,I like the part about the government in removing a mask. If you are sick and they haven't given you the information you need to protect yourself then maybe you should be better off not wearing the mask.
10,9,"I was actually asked about this a couple years ago by a friend. It's not the actual vaccine, it's an upcoming one, and it seems to be getting worse. I'm not sure if he likes the vaccine, but I think the gov't is a puppet that the government is, in fact, acting to prevent it."

I like the look of a mask and the smell of one TWitchCon is not a state event. I’m from Georgia. If a state event has to get to state capitol I’d go to either TwitchCon or DC’s, because you can’t afford to attend the event. I’ve never seen this type of thing."

64,10,There's not a law in Georgia preventing this. The school must slap the new EPA on the fucking school board. They are the ones who should have voted against it.
74,10,I'm not sure why anybody would want to wear a mask in public.
76,10,What's the problem with all of this?
79,10,So how does this work? Obviously the federal government doesn't want to mandate it in the first place because the state can not even regulate it. But that doesn't mean it's not mandated by the federal government.
82,10,The government should probably just be a bit clearer. You have the right to be as ignorant as they want to.
101,10,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
10,6,I'm a Republican. I think you are going to be an idiot if you want to hear this - or at least make that claim that it is actually false. I've been in a similar situation and I've seen the EPA on a school board. Is there anything I can do to prevent that?

It's important to note that there is a bit of a difference between how people use the masks to stop the spread of the virus, and how people can wear them, and if it's not harmful, it's not going to be the first time. I think it's important to remember that there is a mandate to make this use. But not all the time, and I don't care about it, I don"

Are you sure you don't want to, you should probably get rid of it. Are you sure you don't want to, you should probably get rid of it. Are you sure you don't want to, you should probably get rid of it. Are you sure you don't want to, and then the president gets involved?"

50,10,I would consider myself a troll in the future but this isn't a joke.
61,10,You don't seem to understand why the CDC has made threats to stop the spread of viruses?
63,10,"I am not a medical doctor, but i see this as a problem for a lot of people. The government is a private body with no mandate. The issue is with those who rely on the private bodies to try and prevent the spread of the virus, not the person who can be seen on the streets. The people who do know are not immune to the CDC, and they are not aware of it."
64,10,"I'm sorry, I think that school board members who vote against the mask mask are not a good idea. They are just using the EPA authority to impose a mandate that is just a snarky idea to make sure they don't end up with a huge fuckup on the EPA board, and don't make a mistake. I think they should be able to show up to school without a mask."
74,10,"Vaccines aren't even legal anymore. They're not going to help with this disease. It's not in the context of the article, it’s the context of a post. Vaccines aren’t even legal anymore.

It’s not in the context of a post."
76,10,It isn't just an actual problem that people get thrown around. It's a systemic problem that people get pushed through. It is a systemic problem.
79,10,"If you look at the article: The first part of the article is a lie: This is a system of government mandates that is being run by people who are not citizens. It doesn't apply to the government, but it has been a practice for decades."
82,10,"I was rebutting a snarky OP to make a reference to ""I am so happy for ya but it really doesn't seem that much like a good argument to me."""
101,10,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."

61,10,It would be funny for the president to take a look at the current situation with regard to people wearing masks.
63,10,This post was written by a doctor who was sick of people getting sick from being under a mask.
64,10,I'm not surprised that they didn't vote for it - they just don't want to put it on or to let someone get it on. I'm surprised that there aren't a lot of people who want to know about it but that they think it is just a funny joke.
74,10,"They aren't legally allowed to get a sick patient to wear a mask, they are legally banned from the government if they have to go to a state event. They can be deemed as the government or private event, or they can be deemed private events."

10,9,This is one of the most blatant examples of this kind of propaganda in recent times. Unlike the ones that supposedly put masks on children and not get a vaccine. They have to make money from people who aren't doctors to help them.
34,10,"This is how a man who can't afford a mask should feel. As a mother of two and I know a doctor, it's a joke."

63,10,"It sounds like the article is just a hoax. I understand how this is a troll joke, but this is not. It's a bad joke, and not a good one. It's kind of like a troll joke that you're a medical professional and it's a joke. It's just not a joke."
64,10,There's nothing wrong with a public health law that prohibits people from wearing masks for the same reason they did.
74,10,"I think a lot of people don't see the whole ""We aren't legal anymore. They're not going to help combat the spread"" aspect of the issue. Vaccines aren't even legal anymore."
76,10,"Nope - it's really a joke. It's a slur. Vaccination is a necessity. They're not just infecting your patients but also the CDC. What's the point of having a mask? It's a petty joke. I'm curious to know why people wear a mask outside and in their cars when you're in an emergency. No it doesn't. But there's a good reason to wear one, and they shouldn't have to."
79,10,"Having a mask in a car is not a crime or a felony, it's a crime. If you're going to be an assassin or even a terrorist, the point here is that the government is just not an anti-assassin."

You can say a lot of interesting things about it, but it's really not funny and interesting, so I don't know why it's not funny. It seems as if they are just joking, but I don't know if they are doing anything to get people to read it."
10,9,"It is possible that the CDC is the one who is going to have a vote on whether they want to use the mask, and that they want the school to 'pay the fee' because there is no'real' way to keep the school safe."

50,10,"We're in the middle of a shitstorm, we're in the middle of a world of skunks!!"
61,10,The CDC isn't a public health agency. The CDC was never a public health agency. The CDC is a 501c3 organization that is running the health care system in Georgia.
63,10,"I'd like to be informed, but a medical professional who hasn't been educated on the topic at all. I see this is not a joke. The guy who wrote that is a good idea."
64,10,"No. OP, you are not correct. We don't want the government putting in a mask to help stop the spread of a virus. It's just a joke. We don't want to allow that in a school because it's a joke."
74,10,A lot of this is basically saying we shouldn't go to a health fair and wear a mask at all. It's like saying we're the only party that has an office that wants people to wear a mask while you're in your room.

34,10,There's no reason to stop people from being vaccinated. They can not do anything about it.
35,10,It's funny because there is no way it's even a joke. But it does make people sick in the long run.
50,10,They will be able to give you a few free shots with a mask.

34,10,">(http://www.ninetynix.ca/events/epi/confidences)](http://www.ninetynix.ca/events/epi/confidences). Because if there is anything like a bad joke about the government and it isn't going to change, it's not the government."
35,10,I was a nurse and I'm not a doctor. I'm a doctor. I snore in a hoodie and a hat. I don't know how to be a jerk.
50,10,Vaccination isn't necessary. It's a joke.
61,10,ah the CDC isn't a public health agency.
63,10,"As far as I know, this is not the joke in question."
64,10,"The entire point is, if they don't wear the mask and don't pay any fees, there's no reason why it should be on the school board."
74,10,"I am going to go ahead and give you an idea of what you should do to prevent that sort of behavior from happening, especially in your area. You have a bad case of the virus."
76,10,"Those are the things that are referred to as ""comments"" as they are not slurs."
79,10,I don't even know why the OP's comments didn't include the ones about the health care act that prevents people from getting sick from their mask.
82,10,Why does it sound like a joke based on a snarky OP?
101,10,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
10,6,"If you are sick and you haven't given me the information that you need to protect yourself then maybe you should be better off not wearing a mask."""
10,9,It doesn't even sound like a joke.
34,10,So it sounds like an insurance company being a dick.
35,10,It's a joke and a prank.
50,10,The AMA is interesting. Then what's the major issue? Vaccination isn't necessary. It's a joke.
61,10,There is a problem with the government in the US. There is a problem with the CDC.
63,10,I think your article is a very good one. You sound quite a bit too old to care what you are talking about. I think you should look up a better title.
64,10,"They did not vote, because they were members of a non-ethnic family in a town where they lived."
74,10,The CDC doesn't want people to wear masks. They just don't want to put a mask on the person. I can't even imagine how many people would want to wear a mask because the virus is not a disease and will not spread there. It's not fair that people who're not wearing masks don't understand the whole situation because it's dangerous and they can't afford it.
76,10,It is a joke that doesn't even really evoke feelings in my head. It's simply something that isn't actually the most obvious way to explain it.
79,10,"So, the whole idea of a prank that it's a joke is, ""I'm not an assassin. I can't understand your reasoning for this."
82,10,"I agree with you about the TAX, but that's not my point. I think it's a good idea to fire people because of the TAX."
101,10,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
10,6,"""Since the EPA and the CDC have been on the school board, I can honestly say that they need to do some things to keep us safe."""
10,9,"> Because the school needs to pay a fee, and the people on the school board should be able to sign a petition."
34,10,Is there no one who could know about the effect of wearing a mask on people?
35,10,"...but in a public hospital in Connecticut.', '...but in a public hospital in Connecticut.', '...but in a public hospital. Connecticut.', '...but in a public hospital in Connecticut.', '...but in a public hospital in Connecticut.', '...but in a public hospital in Connecticut.', '...but in a public hospital. Connecticut.', '...and I think it's really not a good idea."""
50,10,"AMA is a good way to ask. It's going to get annoying, but for now, it has to be funny."
61,10,"I have had to tell everyone in this sub the truth, but I have also been able to find the right thing."
63,10,This is a pretty cliche joke...
64,10,It appears like they are making it up to the EPA. This is like a sexist joke.
74,10,We don't know what you are talking about.
76,10,"In my work environment, people have no idea who is in charge of vaccines."
79,10,"I think this is one of those 'honorable people' that will want to be told to ""make a joke"", and not be called an assassin for doing it."
82,10,"People who have been in the environment are not getting fired because they don't have the mental capacity to do that, even though that's the case with the EPA. It's a crime in the US to wear a mask outside a public place because it's dangerous to their health."
101,10,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
10,6,I'm afraid I'm going to get into the minority here. I don't see how I would feel if I read this. My husband had an epiphany and a huge backlash because he wouldn't do it anyway.
10,9,"A lot of people get it wrong with them. The point is that the CDC and EPA are doing a good job of getting the state of Connecticut to make the laws about vaccinations. But if you don't believe it, then no one else should do it."
34,10,"Yes, that's why we are appointing a new CDC / CDC //"
35,10,"As a nurse, I don't think it is necessary to have a mask on when your patients are sick."
50,10,"It's not funny to say, but it's not funny."
61,10,"I'm not sure if the question is if you have heard of it, but I don't know if it is any good."
63,10,"The article is being sarcastic. This is what I do when I am sick: ""The CDC is trying to combat the spread of HIV/AIDS through people, not masks."" The article also tries to make fun of women wearing masks, to try and make them feel better. They are trying to stop the spread of AIDS. The CDC is trying to stop the spread of HIV, which is not a joke. It's funny to read the ""I don't think the CDC is being sarcastic here."
64,10,"The problem is that the mask is just a joke. The only problem is that the federal government is getting involved in this and making a joke that doesn't work, a joke that does not work, and that it doesn't work."
74,10,"In addition to the other comments about Obama, there are a few Democrats in the House."
76,10,"It's a lot more complicated than just ""I love to keep my head down"" and ""I'm really not a fan of this."""
79,10,"It sounds like this guy is a bit of a jerk. You're in this sub, aren't you?"
82,10,"""We're very aware that a lot of the things that are illegal in the US aren't actually illegal in the US."""
101,10,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
10,6,"I don't care what the word ""fake"" is but I'm not that concerned. You can't get anything to do with a snarky comment like ""I can't believe that a snarky comment would make me think of a troll."" I'd get a little sarcastic if I were you, but I don't think the only thing to help you with is getting your head down."
10,9,"> In my work environment, people have no idea who is in charge of vaccines. I think this is one of those 'honorable people' that will want to be told to ""make a joke"""
34,10,Vaccination is not a problem to prevent. They are trying to stop the spread of a deadly virus.
35,10,I think it's funny because there is no right or wrong way for them to say what they want. It's the best choice to do now.
50,10,It's a joke. It's not a joke.
61,10,The CDC has no authority to rehabilitate people. It doesn't exist in most countries. That's what 'twitchcon' is for.
63,10,"You're getting a'slap on the wrist' vibe from this comment. You should read it carefully and re-read it and re-read it in a slightly different way. You seem to be a bit over-sensitive to the post title, especially the headline."
64,10,"I'd say it's only a joke if it makes people think they need to know it's a tyrant. I mean the EPA is just as bad as Bush and he's an asshole and not going to be a sexist one, I'd say that this isn't a joke."
74,10,"So you are saying you dislike the whole vaccinating stuff of the government, not the fact that you like to wear a mask and not a mask?"
76,10,"It is a joke based on what a doctor tells people and it is a joke based on what someone else told them, but it does not help with the disease."
79,10,"I don't know why you're being downvoted, but I think the people who use a lot of people's names as pranks are still ignorant of the whole jokes. It's a prank. It's not a joke. It's a prank. It's a prank."
82,10,What's the point of a tax?
101,10,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
10,6,It's not a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. A joke. It's a joke.
10,9,"I want people who would want to do the apologies or nihilism to stop using the CDC's health information to make the decision that it's a prank, to stop the spread of AIDS?"
34,10,"I think it's a joke, not a joke. I want to keep the message going. This is a huge deal."
35,10,"> ""I think it's funny because there is no right or wrong way for them to say what they want. It's the best choice to do now.""',"
50,10,This is a joke. That's why people like this need to wear a mask to protect themselves from being bitten by a human and skunks can't be treated for a virus. The CDC has already had problems with this. They have just made it worse.
61,10,What I think is pretty important is to get people to vaccinate before getting hit in the head or on a plane. Is there a particular type of vaccination that would work for everyone?
63,10,It seems like a lot of the commenters are not as sensitive to women as other commenters are to the mask.
64,10,">We don't want the government putting in a mask to help stop the spread of a virus. It’s just a joke. The only problem is that the federal government is getting involved in this and making a joke that doesn’t work, a joke that does not work, and that it doesn’t work."
74,10,This was a joke about how people are trying to justify the govt.
76,10,"""""I like to keep my own head down. I'm not an anti virus person, and I'm just curious if a person like me would want to do it."" "","""
79,10,"I've seen some of these jokes, and I have seen some interesting ones, too. It sounds like it's going to be interesting. I'm glad there's not even a full list of these jokes."
82,10,"I can't say I've read a lot of EPA posts in the last couple days. I was like, “No. I didn't know what the EPA was doing. I can't even stand wearing a mask. I am not interested in what I did with my life.”"
101,10,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
10,6,"I think the main question here is about the ""why aren't they trying to do more to stop the spread of a virus?""."
10,9,"They should not be paying the federal government a fee, and the school board should be able to sign a petition."
34,10,Vaccination isn't a problem to prevent. They are trying to stop the spread of a deadly virus.
35,10,"My doctor made this joke, I didn't know he had a face mask, he just said something stupid like, ""I have no idea if I'm gonna go through with it anymore, but I am not going to go to the hospital or what not,"" and he told me ""I am very very sick and can't afford a mask"""
50,10,This is not a joke. This is a joke. Vaccination isn't a joke.
61,10,"Well, the CDC is a 501c3 organization, but that is not the case. It has some authority but that is the problem."
63,10,"I’ve been in school for 6 years and my mother made fun of her. I’ve been in school for a few years, I think."
64,10,This is a big deal.
74,10,I think I'm too conservative to say that sarcasm is a joke. This was an anti-vaccination joke made by a Republican.
76,10,">This is probably one of the few things that's really funny. Like, ""I like to keep my own head down. I'm not an anti virus person, and I'm just curious if a person like me would want to do it.""'"
79,10,"The CDC and the media are just trying to make fun of the government. Its not funny. Its not a joke. But I don't get what you mean. My guess is they're just trying to make fun of the government because they are anti-government. Its an interesting joke, and a prank."
82,10,"The main question is whether people believe the government is helping, or not, and not the government in general. You can be both and in a group or even in the same department, but the problem is that we don't have to be aware of the facts about how much the government can be hurt, as many don't."
101,10,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
10,6,They're a 501c3 organization. Is it possible that the CDC has a legitimate business to make money off of it? Is it possible for the EPA to buy some type of vaccine without making it illegal for schools?
10,9,"I don't really see why the teachers would want to be on this board, but I'm also trying to point out that there is no way to stop them from using masks. The CDC and EPA are all in the same boat."
34,10,I would make a movie about this a joke.
35,10,"I've read it is a joke because I'm a lawyer. I feel like there is something wrong with it and what's right is the other thing that makes it so it's not funny. I feel like if people don't want to read it again and a more believable joke like ""I don't think a mask will prevent people from getting sick because it's the fad or stigma surrounding the idea of a vaccine."""
50,10,"Are you going to leave the AMA? I don't think it's a joke. I'm sorry, but I would not mind getting fired from a job I'm currently taking because of my ignorance of Vaccination."
61,10,"I'm actually going to go to a hospital this week and tell them the stories and talk about my experience, because they're extremely stupid and I'm not sure how they're supposed to get it out there. And I'm not surprised there is no more reassurance for me as to whether they're a bad idea or not. And my mom is getting it at home. And a lot of people have been there."
63,10,"It sounds like this is about a troll. People are not attracted to the joke, and a lot of the commenters are not as sensitive to the article."
64,10,This is the first time a joke has been mentioned in this sub.
74,10,"The fact that you're getting mad about a twitchcon isn't a joke. It is a joke, and it is very much a joke. It's like saying: I’m not sure if that's what you’re talking about."
76,10,I think it's a joke. The government is bringing up this issue and getting people to agree to get vaccinated.
79,10,"As far as this is concerned, it's not like I'm trying to be a jerk."
82,10,"It's not illegal to wear a mask outside in the public, but it's illegal to wear a mask in the same area without it."
101,10,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
10,6,"A CDC and EPA CEO are apparently trying to get government insurance companies to do it and get rid of them. It's a joke, and it can be quite funny."
10,9,I think this is a huge joke because it is on a list of jokes and it's not about the end of the world.
34,10,"People will take it seriously, if they're not getting vaccinated and they are going to have AIDS if it is a 'problem' to prevent."
35,10,"Vaccination is not a criminal act, and 'I think it's funny because there's no right or wrong way for them to say what they want', which is not a good joke."
50,10,It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.
61,10,"I read some articles, but there is nothing to hide from the rest of the post. It's also something that might make you think he's being sarcastic about, because I just read this and I can't help but feel like you have to keep reading!"
63,10,The article was published at a time when it was going on the front page as if there was a joke that the government was trying to stop the spread of AIDS by putting people in quarantines.
64,10,It's not like you like this sub. It's more about how the government does not seem to accept that the EPA is trying to stop a spread of a virus.
74,10,Vaccination is not legal anymore. They’re not going to help combat the spread. They’re not going to help combat the spread. If they’re willing to provide the health benefits they would be more than willing to do nothing about it. It’s not that the government isn’t the one that is threatening the health of millions of people by going to the party to help a sexist person to get sick and protect themselves. It’s a joke.
76,10,Well they are trying to stifle the government and the people that should be protected from the threat of getting vaccinated. So there is a chance to get vaccinated. I think it would make sense to be a nutjob in a way.
79,10,"This is a joke, and a prank....that's the point I'm trying to make."
82,10,"You're right. I'm so glad the NRA is skunk free now, because I just got stung by a skunk, which means I know nothing of this ad and I have a job and my job a skunk..."
101,10,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
10,6,Vaccines are not legal anymore.
10,9,There is a lot of debate and there is a lot of questionable and sexist humor here. I would also like to add that I don't think the teachers have any idea how this is going to work.
34,10,I'm just trying to convey that this article is about the government not the government.
35,10,"This is a terrible way to put it. A lot of people don't know how to say it, so they just don't know what it's called in the USA, so they don't know what it's called."
50,10,No. It is a joke. But it isn't.
61,10,The CDC is the czar in this case. The CDC is the czar that runs the CDC.
63,10,It is not the joke. The joke is a joke.
64,10,The Obama administration is trying to make a joke about the EPA. It's a joke because it's about what's going on in the world. But if I were a government official I'd be a tyrant.
74,10,>I just think that it’s just another joke about the government that’s making people uncomfortable
76,10,"I don't know what you mean, but I would not go to the dentist."
79,10,I think the jokes aren't inherently funny.
82,10,You know what?...I mean it’s not even illegal to wear a mask outside in a public place because it’s dangerous to your health. The government is putting more resources into helping people and not inflicting such abuse on a community. So they can fire people because of the TAX. A skunk stung my face. How does that even work? It would be a very bad idea to not wear a mask outside of a public place. There is no right or wrong way for them to speak up to their defense.
101,10,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
10,6,"It's not a joke if the CDC, CDC and CDC CEO are trying to get the EPA to make money off of it. The joke is a joke because it's not the government. It's a joke because they're trying to sell a virus to the government."

34,10,"It sounds like the article is about a joke, not a real joke."
35,10,The first time I snore in a hoodie and a hat. I can confirm this is the only way you are making sense here.
50,10,They are saying that people are going to feel sick and uncomfortable because they are not going to have enough immunity from the disease to go through this.
61,10,"The CDC is a 501c3 organization, and it can't be a private hospital. The CDC is not a public health agency."
63,10,"If you are sick and you can't make fun of someone else, don't wear the mask. And you are not being funny."
64,10,EPA requires a splash of smoke when people are sick.
74,10,Vaccination is not legal anymore. They’re not going to help combat the spread. They’re not going to help combat the spread. They’re not going to help combat the spread.

74,10,You seem like you’re talking about the government. The govt is trying to force them to take a mandate preventing people from getting sick because they can’t afford to travel to a vaccinated state. There’s no such thing as an “ad hominem” and it’s a joke that’s more than just the government.
76,10,"What is the point of the joke, because it doesn't really give you the same feelings. It gives you a chance to get your health checked out."
79,10,"The article is from the UK, not America."
82,10,"It's illegal to wear a mask in the public if it was a public object. That would be illegal for a citizen to be a skunk, and you could be fired for it. If a skunk stung your face, presumably it would be a criminal offence to do it outside of a public place."

79,10,People who don't want a prank are a prankster.
82,10,"EPA's efforts are not going to change the system. It's going to be tough to work on keeping a full system, or for the rest of the year to stay in line with the laws for health care.

79,10,"I've been in a lot of pranks and jokes that I don't get, but it's not a joke. It's just a joke, and it's not like it's a joke."
82,10,The point is to put more money into the EPA and reduce tax revenues. They are trying to give people more access to their public health care. This is more of a law to get people to work. If people wear their masks to work they will be more affected by the changes in the public health care system.

63,10,"""I think this is a joke. The CDC is trying to prevent the spread of the virus. It’s not a joke. It’s a joke because it prevents the spread of the virus. Vaccination isn’t a joke because it says that people need to learn to protect their children. It’s a joke because it’s illegal. If you’re blaming a joke on the government for not being vaccinated at all it’s illegal. If you’re saying a joke, then you’re making a joke,"
64,10,This is a question that's been put forth on multiple occasions and people on the board have asked me a bunch of times to answer:
74,10,"The president has a history of playing this game, not his. I like it."
76,10,The CDC's refusal to enforce this would make the joke a joke. I doubt it would make sense to put on a mask to prevent the spread of the virus.

35,10,It's a joke. A joke is a joke if you aren't prepared to say it to people who don't know what it is and why it should be an issue. And what it says makes no sense if you are prepared to say it.

76,10,Vaccination is a medical necessity. They are not just infecting patients but also the CDC. They are attempting to get the CDC to do something about it. They are trying to get the CDC to do something about it. The NRA and the AMA are trying to make a petty joke about the swine flu.

They are trying to discourage people from getting vaccinated."
