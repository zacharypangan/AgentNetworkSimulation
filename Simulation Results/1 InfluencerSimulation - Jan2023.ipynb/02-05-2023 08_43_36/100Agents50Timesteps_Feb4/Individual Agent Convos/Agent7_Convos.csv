89,7,Are you kidding? It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of the virus.
45,7,I like you but I think the idea of a face mask being worn as a protective mask is absurd.
52,7,Why do you wear a mask when you are supposed to be the king of the internet?
53,7,You need to make an exception to all the restrictions on the wear of face masks. That's just a rule you can't change. There is a reason not to wear face masks. It's more that you have to wear a mask to prevent people from catching the flu. It's not a rule of thumb if you do something illegal to prevent it from spreading.

85,7,I don't know why people do not like wearing a mask. They can 't see where he is making it if the masks have the effect of putting people down. It seems to be the masks used to mask the mouth and throat.
89,7,>Well they are wearing a mask to help spread it. I don't think so. There is also a mask that could help the government stop spread of the virus.

79,7,"This is how you're supposed to use your speech. A mask is a kind of mask. Usually with the purpose of preventing the spread of diseases, but usually for preventing sickness or injury. This is something that you shouldn't be uncomfortable with. I do have a set of hats, and a helmet, but I'm not sure I can wear a mask in a pinch."
81,7,It is a little oversimplified.

52,7,"Having a fucking nose isn't a good reason to wear a mask, is it?"
53,7,I think that's the thing to think. It seems like the government wants to stop people from becoming sick to give people a choice.
68,7,"In this situation, you have to wear a mask. It is necessary to protect you from the spread of a virus, it's not a mandate."
71,7,"I had a really good friend that once wore a mask. He was super protective, and we didn't have to get the whole thing back on the ground. So he said that wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."

He can get away with it, but he doesn't want to risk an infection that he hasn't taken to a doctor to prevent it. There's a difference between having a doctor and trying to save you. He wants to prevent the spread of a virus by stopping his employees from wearing their masks."
89,7,There's also a mask that could help the government stop the spread of the virus.
45,7,"No, the US government has no authority."

68,7,"I'm not a racist. I don't think he's racist. It's a cliche based joke. But a simple joke that you've heard is a nice one. It's the kind of joke that makes you want to do something, it doesn't mean you're not being sexist or sexist."
71,7,"My family was the biggest fan of the movie ""Wearing a mask"" and it's been called the ""fucking lie"" of the country. It's a good joke."

84,7,"It was funny that someone argued that the President was wearing a mask to protect himself from being shot in the face. Besides, if the president said ""oh man I should come to Georgia"" or something like that, then he probably would have a lot more cynicism about the president having to wear a mask to prevent him from being shot in the face."

45,7,"They have a policy to allow people to refuse to wear a mask. They use it for public health reasons, and even then, it is only in response to the threat of a virus."
52,7,It's a great way to get over the ignorance that some people make in regards to the virus - the fact that one person has a voice to speak to is the real question. I think it is time to take the time to research the problem.
53,7,It seems like the government wants to stop people from becoming sick to give people a choice. It seems like they want to give people a choice.
68,7,"There is no way to prevent the spread of a virus unless it is cured at a national level. You need to wear a mask, then a hoodie, to prevent it from spreading."
71,7,This is a good thing. What a good way to get out of the media and have a good time.
79,7,I figured that a lot of the same thing happened to me when I stayed in the US.
81,7,"I don't think the government is trying to stop a 'war on drugs' because it is against the federal law, it's only going to worsen the situation."
84,7,"We're at an point in our lives where we cannot really be in the position we're in. This is what is at the heart of the health care debate here. We need to talk about vaccines and what the other guys are wearing, and the reasons they aren't in the position, and I'm afraid I haven't heard any good news for that either. If I were the President, I'd be able to talk about all the issues and the policies of the president in that area."
85,7,"... so in addition, the idea of wearing a mask in a public place is a stupid but completely legitimate issue."

81,7,I would take a piece of paper and just throw it in my car.
84,7,The issue is that people are still trying to convince the rest of us that a mask can protect themselves against the effects of a virus and that it is necessary to protect someone else who has already died or died of it.
85,7,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.It sounds like a really horrible movie. I'm sure the CDC has found a very good source to make that up.
89,7,"No. They can be a bad thing. They have to go. People have to go. The government needs to pay for it, and that's the only way it can work."
45,7,And what is that? The EPA will probably get involved with the investigation.
52,7,They need to stop the skunk joke that they're claiming is funny.
53,7,I don't know what the real joke is.

79,7,> I think you're probably the only one who was not a racist.
81,7,I can't believe he had to wear a mask in his car. :)
84,7,"I believe that this isn't a conservative problem. I do know that there are people in the world who think the president should be wearing a mask because he isn't sure what to do with it, but I'm sure that he's a good person and can use it against someone who's sick or dying. Isn't this just because of the fact that he is the only one who can actually visn't wear a mask when he's sick?"
85,7,"As someone who has volunteered to do everything to keep the president alive and healthy, I know this can't go too far to say that it is a fucking bad thing. It's like saying it's your responsibility to take care of the fucking people you care about. And then, it's just that you don't know how to explain it."
89,7,"""I'm a liberal and a good part of the healthcare industry."

68,7,It would be a joke. The joke doesn't seem funny. It doesn't matter if it's true or not.
71,7,I think wearing a mask in public is pretty amazing. The premise is very ghetto. It's too big of a red flag.
79,7,"They don't have the right to say this, or to use their wits on you and to do so without your knowledge."
81,7,"I can see a huge difference between the two. The idea of 'Waring a mask outside or in your car alone,' which isn't actually a good idea, and the idea of 'Waring a mask in your car alone,' which is the same as a 'war on drugs' that isn't a good idea because it doesn't give the impression of being ""invading a country"". I can see a big difference between this and the first thing people have to worry about. Then I would take a small sheet"
84,7,It seems that the government is trying to influence the situation but doesn't have enough support for a system where people can wear whatever they want.
85,7,>'Is this the same President as who I grew up with and my wife and I? That is so funny.'
89,7,"I've written about a lot of people doing what they are supposed to do and being ""sexist"" tbh."
45,7,I think you should write a troll letter to the president asking for a prank and then tell him he needs to wear a mask.
52,7,The CDC is a skunk!
53,7,I think this is just a jibe.
68,7,"i dont understand what the whole point of it is. i'm not a big fan of anyone who believes they need to wear a mask and have the cliche in their head. they are the problem, they're not funny and the government doesnt care."

45,7,I'd be shocked to see that any of these things are still in use and that they have nothing to do with a government.
52,7,They can't say how to stop the virus. They're going to need more info about it and help with the prevention.
53,7,"""We aren't going to use this to stop the outbreak then we're going to end up with more deaths and more medical expenses and more health care."
68,7,"You know, the one that has been on Reddit for a couple months and a bit under a week is a joke."
71,7,The article claims it was made at the time of the filming. It's a very interesting premise and I'm glad the movie has got a few good quotes from different parts of the country.

89,7,They could stop it in their heads by going into their lungs while in the bathroom.
45,7,It's a prank to use one of those stuff to make a joke. I think that's the real problem. The US government is incompetent and can't afford to cut ties. You could also get a job as a doctor with no money.
52,7,This isn't just a joke. This is a dick joke.
53,7,"This is an interesting post about the NFL. My favorite AMA ever. It's pretty much a joke. I'm not saying this isn't racist, but there are certain situations in which people need to make a decision that makes them feel safe and make sense of it."

71,7,"This whole ""we can't help you when it comes to the economy. We have just stopped people from eating and drinking. Then we get the news on the local news and have a job interview. We're starting to have a better feeling about myself.""."

84,7,"That was kind of the point. I mean, I'd be a lot more open about not going to the stadium with the mask."
85,7,"It's not funny at all. It's an excuse to say ""I think it is an option and a good reason to not buy it. I think it's a petty joke."" It doesn't sound like something people actually want to hear."

52,7,It doesn't matter what your family is eating. It's the fact that a doctor with a prankcast of a doctor who has nothing to do with the ACA. This is not a prank.
53,7,This is not a joke.
68,7,This article is not funny. I'm just saying the fact that he says it's funny because he believes it's necessary to protect himself would have a negative impact on the health of the person who's wearing the mask.
71,7,"When they were doing it for the first time they were going to go to the government to look for food for their poor neighbors. Its a great opportunity to make friends and make friends but the reality is it's not. It's not like there is a new or new religion, just people with more money who want to live on the side of the road."

45,7,"A prank mask is a joke that uses the word ""man"" to make a joke about the government."

84,7,Isn't it funny that the president wears a mask and it has to protect him from being shot? It's not funny.
85,7,">""When I was in the hospital with my husband last week. It was a real life accident, and I did not do anything about it. It was a big joke."
89,7,People who don't want to do something are making the government pay for it. But they are not being treated right. So that's not what it's about. The government is trying to make it illegal. It's a joke. I think the joke isn't an issue because a doctor or nurse should be paid for.
45,7,That doesn't make sense. There are some serious issues with the ACA. The ACA isn't going to work.
52,7,"if the CDC wanted to repeal it, they would have to take a hat and a helmet, if the CDC had no authority and the CDC was getting a hat on him and it would have to be on the hats."

81,7,Is the joke being explained by the guy who wrote the article?
84,7,Why is the president wearing a mask to protect himself from being shot in the face?
85,7,There is a huge difference between a 'tis a joke' and 'tis a joke' and a 'to do everything to protect the people'.
89,7,What do you want to do when you're sick?
45,7,"I think the ACA is pretty cool. You can wear a mask if you want. Just as long as you don't wear a mask in public. That way the government is not a joke to you. It isn't legal to use the word ""man"" to be an acceptable expression."
52,7,"ah the hat is a prank. It's a joke, and it's a joke. The cdc is a joke, and it's a joke because it isn't true, it's a joke."
53,7,"I think that's a pretty interesting topic. You've been able to make a lot of connections, and you've got a lot of interesting facts."
68,7,I don't know what's funny about the idea of a helmet being a 'no' for everyone on the team.
71,7,IANAL OP but I found this pretty funny.
79,7,So this is the next step? Vaccination is a joke.
81,7,"It's not funny at all. It's a joke that has little to do with what's called a ""war on drugs"". It's a joke based on the idea of a ""war on drugs"" (the idea that the government is invading a country, so it's an antisemitic joke). The phrase ""war on drugs"" is used by Americans to discredit government, so it's a joke. It's not a joke involving the idea that it's not a joke."
84,7,"What you're saying is, it's a joke, not a joke, and this is infuriating. It's a joke, and I'm so happy that you know what that means. It seems like a little of a misunderstanding based on your comment, which hasn't changed."

89,7,I believe it's because the Obama administration is trying to make a joke about health care. It's being sexist and racist.
45,7,"I mean, you do know that they could be able to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS by making people wear masks, but they would need to be able to prove it was an act of pranking, not a joke."
52,7,"If you go to a doctor's office and you have to wear a hat for it to come off, do it if you don't want to do it."
53,7,This has got nothing to do with the ACA or the ACA itself.
68,7,"It's not an AMA about a joke, it's a joke."
71,7,I know a couple people who would like to come to the US to help out in the future.
79,7,"Well, I'm getting it right. That is not a joke, it's a joke."
81,7,"So what I am talking about is, if the person is not a hunk of shit, is that the person's job is to discredit the government?"
84,7,You've been given this opportunity. You've shown us the true meaning of the phrase 'the president is wearing a mask'.
85,7,"No. And no. No, because he is trying to force people to understand how they are acting."
89,7,"In the US, people don't wear masks when they're in an emergency and aren't HIV carriers. There is no vaccine to stop HIV from spreading. There is no vaccine to stop it from spreading."
45,7,It's so odd to me that the CDC can't do it in a funny fashion. This is what it is and I can't believe it's done.
52,7,"It is a joke, and the CDC is a ripoff of a joke, because they are the pranksters, the people who were talking about it are the pranksters. :D"
53,7,A joke about how the president and his staff will not be able to protect the nation from being infected isn't an excuse for the ACA.
68,7,Is a joke about people being racist?
71,7,"I don't understand why it's not in the article, but I'm sure I'm getting a lot of great ones here."
79,7,"If you dread being stung by a skunk in the CDC, do not tell him the answer is: he should go back to the CDC and explain the problem, and if you aren't, you should tell them the answer is: don't go back to the CDC and explain it. He shouldn't have said that if the CDC makes fun of the government, it doesn't have to be the same as the CDC."
81,7,"The word ""war"" is used by Americans to discredit government, so it's a joke."
84,7,"I don't think you understand why the phrase ""I think a mask is crazy"" isn't a sexist joke. The idea of a mask is not just about how it is used, it's about the way it looks to people. It's not a joke, it's just being a joke."

84,7,What about a woman who wants to be president?
