90,80,Is that right? Is it that someone in Douglas County should wear a mask in public places like schools?
94,80,"Yeah, you're a stupid person."
99,80,I'm so sick of seeing a guy wearing masks.
80,31,"My aunt says this is a common rule. She has a helmet to wear while being dressed. She has to wear it every day for at least a few months, in the summer, when you are out."
80,78,"It's called 'infected' by the medical staff in DC. In DC, they get to wear a mask in public to help spread the virus, and it varies by school."
83,80,"I am not saying I am a good coach, but it seems like a great deal of work and effort goes into making this work. The people who use it actually work on the problem."

83,80,If you do nothing you'll always get your hair on a sleeve and have to be shaved off. It's funny.
90,80,I've always believed that this was one of the worst things to happen in the ACA.
94,80,OP... you're the one that doesn't like the government's actions to stop the spread of a virus
99,80,"Its the ejaculation of the ejaculation and the fear of getting sick, which is what a lot of people don't understand. It's like putting on the mask to protect you from the sun from the sun, and then letting them go."

80,78,"So, they don't use the masks and wear it while in public - which doesn't mean they don't want to - in schools?"
83,80,"[Sorry, I don't need a mask. It's called 'Sorry, I don't need a mask'."
90,80,There's an AMA that comes up every time you are on your birthday party...
94,80,People are supposed to think that these masks stop the spread of any type of illness and stop the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask is one of the most effective means for preventing the spread of a virus.
99,80,Are you saying they aren't actually going to stop the spread of a virus? Because they are.
80,31,I read that in a book in college.
80,78,"It's called ""Assisting the spread of a virus"" as I think it is. The ACA was passed on April 1st, 2012, and the US Congress passed the 'Holding the Vaccines Act' to stop the spread of a virus. It isn't a law, just an idea."
83,80,I don't know why people think this is weird. I think I just don't see it as a valid reason.
90,80,A lot of people are shocked at how quickly and consistently this is happening.
94,80,It's one of the most effective means to prevent a virus.
99,80,This is one of the most depressing and disturbing things that ever happened in the US.
80,31,"If I were in the states, I'd tell my family and friends to wear a mask. I'm sure they know what the law is and have no idea what the law is."
80,78,I'm a doctor. I've been a doctor for years. There's not a lot that I can say that helps prevent the spread of this virus.
83,80,"If your not a good coach, then your lack of knowledge on the military has made this nonsense much harder to handle. It has to do with the lack of leadership."
90,80,>Is the issue with the mask in your city really that difficult to work out? Is it is my responsibility to do my own thing.
94,80,You want to know what kind of mask the government is trying to prevent?
99,80,"A government sponsored vaccine that has been used in Africa for nearly 2 generations has also resulted in a lot of deaths. Its a joke, but isn't a joke."
80,31,"I agree. I would say if you were in the states, you'd tell your family and friends to wear a mask. They'll be shocked to hear about that as well."
80,78,"I don't even know why I believe this. You know it was a joke and you could see it on TV, but you know it."
83,80,"I do not understand the whole sexist thing. In fact, the whole idea of a mask is absurd."
90,80,Is he really doing this on purpose. Maybe he's fucked out of his element by a skunk?
94,80,They want to stop the spread of the virus. I don't understand why anyone would think that the government should not use these things.
99,80,"This is not a joke, that's just not a joke, and people need to know what to do."
80,31,There's so much going on here that it's hard to imagine this to even be a valid reason.
80,78,"I think this is the most depressing and disturbing thing that ever happened in the US. If I were in the states, I'd tell my family and friends to wear a mask. I'm sure they know what the law is and have no idea what the law is."
83,80,People are complaining that the US doesn't really care about protecting the public if they don't get vaccinated.
90,80,"No, he's trying to make a point that the issue is not the ACA. There are already a lot of other reasons to support it, including one of removing it from your life."
94,80,Vaccination is not required for everyone unless the person is in an advanced stage of a clinical trial. Wearing a mask doesn't help in stopping the spread of a virus.
99,80,"I've been sick of seeing a guy wearing a mask for about six months. That's about me. I can't go on a trip without it and be sick, even though I can do so much more than I can do today."
80,31,It's not a joke.
80,78,"I think it was a joke. It was just an idea. It wasn't a law. They said that this was a joke and they wanted to stop the spread. The ACA was passed on April 1st, 2012, and the US Congress passed the Holding the Vaccines Act. The government doesn't care about protecting the public if they don't get vaccinated."
83,80,"""The president has said it's his job to prevent people from being infected. He has said it has a lot to do with the people who are trying to fight the virus. I think it's going to be great to see what the NRA is attempting to do... Vaccination is essential to stopping the spread of a virus. The government, not the media, is implementing anti-vaccine measures in states where they have mandates to keep people vaccinated. That's all that's going on in the thread."
90,80,It's kinda like if the article mentions the fact that the school voted against it. They could have voted against it for safety reasons.
94,80,You don't have to wear a mask to get a vaccine. They need to stop preventing the spread of the virus.
99,80,"I was sick of seeing a guy wearing a mask - I'm not sure I understand why it was a joke. I thought it was the mask to protect me from the sun from the sun - I was like ""What's wrong with that?"
80,31,[Of course it's a joke. The US government doesn't care about protecting the public if they don't get vaccinated.
80,78,>I think it's going to be great to see what the NRA is attempting to do...
83,80,Vaccination is essential to stopping the spread of a virus. People are complaining that the US doesn't really care about protecting the public if they don't get vaccinated. The president has said it's his job to prevent people from being infected. He has said it has a lot to do with the people who are trying to fight the virus. It's also an issue with having the public gov't be the healthiest country in the world. It's really ridiculous. And it is.
90,80,"That's a lot of skunks. If a skunk was in a school, it's likely a skunk in a neighborhood. It's not like they are doing it on purpose. I'd go watch a couple if you aren't sure what it is about skunks in a school. It's going to be more or less a skunk thing, a lot more than the movie."
94,80,What do they do if you don't have a mask?
99,80,This is pretty much a joke. They can be blaming everyone else for it. Its the governments fault for ignoring it and putting it in writing as a joke.
80,31,I read the headline and it came up as a joke. The NRA is being a huge ally in the effort to make the US the healthiest country in the world.
80,78,I think it's really ridiculous. And it's pretty much a joke. They can be blaming everyone else for it. Its the governments fault for ignoring it and putting it in writing as a joke.
83,80,"The whole idea of a mask in a public place is a ridiculous, ridiculous statement."
90,80,"I would go see a couple of skunk movies for example. It's interesting to see the difference between ""The article"" and ""Is this a good thing, but this is a good thing"" in terms of removing the ACA."
94,80,It's not exactly a joke. It's a joke about people saying it's not necessary. The question is why would it have to be in the article. It's basically just a joke that the government isn't responsible for preventing the spread of the virus.
99,80,So... what is a joke?
80,31,"Vaccination is essential to stopping the spread of a virus.Vaccination is not required for everyone unless the person is in an advanced stage of a clinical trial. Wearing a mask doesn't help in stopping the spread of a virus. I've been sick of seeing a guy wearing a mask for about six months. That's about me. I can't go on a trip without it and be sick, even though I can do so much more than I can do today. It's not a joke."
80,78,I can't even think of any other way to explain it:
83,80,That's a really sexist statement. Is it the first ad from a group of nutjobs complaining about a government policy in which you get an anti-vaccination message? That's a pretty terrible idea.
90,80,"I feel it's hard to ascribe a quorum to the ACA since it's so short. The people who want it, haven't seen the movie, don't want it at all."
94,80,"I agree with the others here, the article is a joke about the government trying to stop the spread of viruses and vaccines. People are supposed to do their own research."
99,80,Vaccination is an important part of protecting children and the public from a deadly virus.
80,31,You're trying to get in on something a little different than what the article said.
80,78,I know this is an extreme example of what is going on in the U.S. today.
83,80,"I don't think it's a great idea, because the people who use it actually work on the problem."
90,80,> I've always believed that this was one of the worst things to happen in the ACA. This is about a man who is still going to die without the help of a mask.
94,80,Vaccination is a joke for everyone that is in the study.
99,80,What a joke. I am very disappointed by this and I hate this insecurity.
80,31,I would say that you're doing the right thing.
80,78,"YMMV, I'm sure you've got it right."
83,80,"The government, not the media, is implementing anti-vaccine measures in states where they have mandates to keep people vaccinated."
90,80,"I don't see any problem with having people in public places wear masks, though I believe in getting a medical device for the kids, and getting one for the kids in public because of a skunk being in the school."

80,31,I wore a mask to protect myself.
80,78,"I'm a doctor and I wear a mask in public for the purpose of protecting myself, and the children."
83,80,"I love the title. I think it's a good idea. I think it's a great idea. Having your face on a mask helps you prevent your infection, and your face on a helmet helps help prevent a virus from spreading."
90,80,I'm in the US and a lawyer in AZ.
94,80,A little bit of a misinformation.
99,80,In my state it is one of the most effective ways of combating it. They are putting it in writing as a joke and making money off it.
80,31,"If I were in the states, I'd tell my family and friends to wear a mask. I'm sure they know what the law is and have no idea what the law is."
80,78,"I think if the government is going to protect the public, I would think it's a bit of a joke. The government is trying to convince people to use their own research."
83,80,"I'm a nutjob. This is nonsense. It's an issue. But this is a serious issue. I'd be a fool not to think this way, but it is ridiculous to make an issue like this."
90,80,"Thats an easy one! 'Wood I'm not sure why people don't get an AMA, why don't you get an AMA and let's go to a couple of skunk movies.'... and I'm going to a couple of skunk movies to get an AMA? 'Is this a good thing?"
94,80,I love this quote. I never realized it was only a joke. It was a joke because I didn't have the confidence to say it!
99,80,Is this just the first time they've been able to convince me to do something? Because that is exactly what they are trying to do - get vaccinated. I'd be fine if they just threw themselves in jail if they tried.
80,31,"This is a real, serious issue, you will do nothing. It's not the truth, it's the people."
80,78,"It's a joke and they are making money from it. This was a joke that the government doesn't care about protecting the public. I have a great story, and the NRA has made a shit lot of money off of it."

90,80,"I know it's not a bad idea to wear a mask in public places but it's not a bad idea at all. But he's saying it's not a bad idea and it is a bad idea. The school's AMA isn't even that great, its all about a guy who hasn't had an AMA. That's a good idea."
94,80,"The article seems like a joke, but i'd say the majority of the commenters are overly concerned with the actual CDC and CDC."
99,80,It is a joke. They are putting it in writing to convince people to do something unless they are allowed to do it.

83,80,The issue of a mask in a public place isn't just a joke. It's a sexist statement. It's a joke because a joke about a government policy is one of the most important issues on this subreddit.

80,78,This is a serious issue.
83,80,I think it's a joke because they are using the wrong word here because they think we're just giving the guy a bad word.
90,80,The NRA is a terrorist group. They are trying to get the U.S. government to do everything they can to help.
94,80,"I've found that saying this is a joke is not really a joke, because the fact that people wear the mask at all makes sense, considering they're on an individual level (as in, not just in the medical field, that's an essentially legal requirement to protect a patient) that isn't even the correct way to describe it."
99,80,"That's right, a little bit sexist unless you really want to be slandered, and I'd definitely be in favor of it."
80,31,The NRA is trying to re-shape the health of the population. The truth is they are getting very angry about this and are making them a bad ally to help. They just can't make the people understand that they're wrong.

99,80,"You sounded like your mother was mad about it. The other guys were shit because they are sexist. You sound like a bit of a fucking joke, but I just can't imagine the kids at the hospital asking if they are fucking mad about it. I know the doctors were going to tell them to not give them a pass.

80,78,"Unless you think it is a joke - I don't care if you say that.... aka if you think the government is making a lot of money off of this, I'm sure you're not going to get rid of it."
83,80,ahahah this is ridiculous.
90,80,"AMA for the NRA and a mask in public places... which I also find pretty offensive, but the AMA is really not a satire. It's a satire about the ACA."
94,80,I'm not sure what else a doctor needs to wear to stop the spread of a virus.
99,80,"As an American, I find it somewhat ironic that people who aren't aware of the dangers of a vaccine being used are willing to wear a mask and unless it causes them problems, the joke is valid."
80,31,"I'm not defending the NRA, but I do respect their position on the issue."
80,78,I don't think that the NRA has any interest in the issue.
83,80,The ACA and other health care reforms are not going to be addressing the issue for long. But the president's stance on it is a bit more subtle.
90,80,"""Skunks in public places are an important part of the health care system."""
94,80,The wording of that article is basically just a joke about people saying it's not necessary for everybody.
99,80,There's a joke out there on 'i'm sick' that the whole topic of 'i've been sick of seeing a guy wearing a mask' is going on.
80,31,They are trying to make you feel better about your own health and we can't force you to fucking wear a mask unless you haven't already.
80,78,"It's a joke. The ACA passed, and it was repealed."
83,80,"This is a joke, I haven't seen it. It's just not funny enough. It's not a joke, but it's not a joke."
90,80,"CANNOTANSWER: ""I like to think that wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I don't have the power to change the health care system. I do not know if there's a statewide law to change it based on the lack of evidence or what to do to stop it. I don't know if this is a conspiracy but I've been in the area for 9 years and the skunk"
94,80,Vaccination is a joke. People do not want to know what to say about it.
99,80,"I think there is a difference between a joke and a joke. It's not a joke at all, it's just a joke."
80,31,OP's mom is the only person with a legitimate interest in helping people die from AIDS.
80,78,"I think you've got the joke, not the joke."
83,80,I'm so sorry for the stupid joke. I didn't even think this was a joke.
90,80,"""I'm so sorry for your loss, but you don't have to think for the sake of the movie you're being misinformed. We're being in an awful place, we should know it was a good idea to just stop this."""
94,80,Vaccination is not a joke. Vaccination is not a joke.
99,80,I don't understand why the joke was made.
80,31,"I think a lot of people want to say the same thing, but not all people are able to do it. I think the thing is that when you have the chance, you can't put your head to the ground, a person will have a hard time breathing and it's really not an issue for you. That's all that's in it for the sake of the article."
80,78,"The ACA passed and the NRA was enacted in 2012, and they got on the bandwagon."
83,80,Why are people so interested in this?
90,80,I would get a mask for my kids. I can’t believe that there are so many skunks in my town that they are infested and the number of people that have skunks in my neighborhood is much higher.
94,80,> It's a joke because it's the government's job to prevent the spread of a virus.
99,80,"""An important part of protecting children and the public from a deadly virus. Its part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.If you have a mask and you want to wear it, then you're a dick."" (http://www.hdsf.gov/cdc/vhht/dht/cd/ipht.htm)."

80,78,> I'm sure they know what the law is and have no idea what the law is.
83,80,Why is this still a joke?
90,80,I don't think I have read this. I think it's one of those things where the law is wrong and the law is wrong. A lot of people are hating the ACA.
94,80,Vaccination is a joke. It is a joke because it's the government's job to prevent the spread of a virus.
99,80,Vaccination is a legitimate medical necessity.
80,31,It's a joke and it's not going to go away in a year. The issue is a joke and you can't make a joke about it.
80,78,It's a joke because it's a joke. And the government is trying to get the government to take it out on people. The government is trying to get the public to take it out on people who aren't in the business of protecting the public.
83,80,I'm not sure if the whole thread is funny or a joke. I'm pretty sure that all of the posts in the sub are about this thing:
90,80,"The AMA was originally intended to be against the ACA, and is about a girl who is infested with skunks."
94,80,>I love this quote. I never realized it was only a joke.
99,80,People who don't understand it are going to think they're a joke. It's going to be silly if the government really is.
80,31,Vaccination isn't required for everyone unless the person is in an advanced stage of a clinical trial. Wearing a mask doesn't help in stopping the spread of a virus.
80,78,It's one of those things where the law is wrong and the government is trying to get the government to take it out on people.
83,80,>The NRA is trying to stop the spread of a virus.
90,80,"''I'm sorry for your loss, but I don't have to think for the sake of the movie you are being misinformed."
94,80,"They're saying if we don't have a mask, it's a joke about them trying to stop the spread of a virus."
99,80,"The thing about the article was that the CDC is making a joke about a problem. It's a joke. A funny thing is that when they'saved' the problem of a sick person or their parents and wanted to help, they were trying to get rid of it."
80,31,I'd tell my family and friends to wear a mask. They know the law and don't need to know. What they're doing is making the right decision and we're going to have to make an informed decision.
80,78,I see a lot of interesting points about this post here:
83,80,Why are you pointing out that the AMA in question was not about vaccines. It was about a skunk trying to use them to make it sound like the ACA was a joke and not about vaccines.
90,80,"I think that the NRA needs to work out how to do something about it. I would like to get the AMA, but I don't have the answers yet."
94,80,"There's nothing wrong with a mask. It's a joke because it's the government's job to prevent the spread of a virus. I don't think it's a crime, but it's a moral issue."
99,80,"It's a joke that's used by the government as part of its own health policy, which is an incredibly complicated subject, and in many cases it's a joke in and of itself."
80,31,"""Don't have a problem with the government trying to stop the spread of a virus. They're not getting the government to do it, but they will do it."""
80,78,The point of 'I don't want to live in a country where I'm a doctor' is to be in a country with no policing system to prevent spread of virus.'
83,80,That's not an AMA. That's a joke about a joke.
90,80,>I know a lot of things about things are skunk-friendly.
94,80,It's a joke because it's the government's job to prevent the spread of a virus.
99,80,"Vaccination is a legitimate medical necessity. It isn't mandatory, but it is the minimum requirement for a doctor's job to do so."
80,31,>I don't have a problem with the government trying to stop the spread of a virus.
80,78,"""I am not saying I am a good coach, but it seems like a great deal of work and effort goes into making this work. The people who use it actually work on the problem. I want to be in the r/advices so bad Is that right?"""

90,80,I think the article is misleading because it does not mention the EPA and NRA's authority to change the health care system. They have been trying to get the US government to do everything they can to help. [
94,80,"The CDC is trying to prevent the spread of the virus by announcing a new vaccine on a person, not by doing it. They're trying to neoconstill it and nab a piece of money."
99,80,"I know it was not the joke but I don't know how to pronounce it. Vaccination is a medical necessity. It isn't mandatory, but it's the minimum requirement for a doctor's job to do so."
80,31,"In my opinion, people who wear a mask in public are either ok with it or need to make an informed decision."
80,78,>I don't think it's a joke. It's a joke because it's the government's job to prevent the spread of a virus. They're trying to convince people to do something unless they are allowed to do it.

90,80,I'm a lawyer in Arizona.
94,80,That's how you describe an interview in which two people are describing a joke and two others are asking questions about a joke that isn't a joke.
99,80,"I've had a friend get me the ""Hilton hat's that suck"" hat every time I have to go out. He was a good friend and he was a good friend as well. And the hat was nice. He got me to wear a shirt that showed he's a good guy and I'm sure it's the perfect shirt for you."
80,31,I'm a lawyer.

90,80,"The ""It's hard to imagine being a skunk on your birthday if you're from the US."""
94,80,"I think the point is that wearing a mask and not using a mask is an incredibly inappropriate way to prevent the spread of any kind of infectious disease. But in that case, you're a doctor in a health care setting who can afford to put on a mask. So, the fact that you don't wear a mask doesn't make the actual joke anything. But it's the fact that you wear a mask all the time. You don't have to wear a mask to prevent spreading the virus or if you don't have a restraining"
99,80,"The article is misleading. If it isn't a joke, then the title is making fun of it."
80,31,"I'm not defending the NRA, but I don't see a difference between the two."
80,78,"A CDC memo said the NRA would ""take the vaccinate out of the country and not the country I live in, and they have to go to jail to reschedule a bunch of medical staff members."""
83,80,The issue is that we need to address the fact that the vaccine is not on the market.
90,80,"I'm a lawyer in Arizona, and I can tell you I think it's a good idea."
94,80,"I can't imagine being a doctor without a mask. That's one thing, but I think a lot of people have a right to be afraid of it. And that's just a pity."
99,80,People are crazy about that fucking joke.
80,31,"I don't know about AIDS, but I've never been tested for it. It sounds like the ""the truth is he is trying to make the people understand that he's wrong."" quote was actually a joke. Vaccination is not required for everyone unless the person is in an advanced stage of a clinical trial. Wearing a mask doesn't help in stopping the spread of a virus."
80,78,Its a joke. Its a joke because it's a joke. Its a joke because it's a joke.
83,80,It's a joke. And there is absolutely no reason not to.
90,80,">[[The article is misleading, it says the NRA are a terrorist group."

80,78,I don't have a problem with my personal privacy unless i'm on the phone and I'm not on the phone. It seems like a joke that the guy who was trying to get him to not wear it is not a joke.
83,80,... and I'm so sorry that this is being retold. It is so hard for me to explain it as a joke.
90,80,I think a AMA is better than a medical device. The AMA is better than a hat-off AMA.
94,80,I’m gonna go with... It’s not a joke. Vaccination isn’t a joke because it’s the government’s job to prevent the spread of a virus. It’s a joke because the government isn’t doing its job to prevent the spread of a virus.
99,80,The joke was made at a joke convention to teach people the joke. They're going to do a joke about a petty issue.
80,31,"In our culture, I would be afraid of them putting you out of the picture, but not knowing if I can understand what's going on."

90,80,They are trying to get the government to do everything they can to stop.
94,80,I just wanted to make sure that you understand that there is a joke about vaccines. I agree that wearing a mask is the worst way to prevent the spread of a virus.
99,80,"I'm an american who was in school at the time, I was terrified that I would get sick of seeing a guy in a mask, because of a joke I made at a joke convention, and I thought the joke was funny, because it was about a problem people had in their lives. I'm shocked I did."
80,31,"I mean, it sounds like a joke and an actual joke and a joke but I think it's kind of funny."
80,78,I'd go out and be a part of the r/advices subreddit and get an AMA with your article. It is going to be great to read this.
83,80,AMA AMA? If the name was 'Cann't even see' on the title then I was imagining a joke about the AMA AMA.
90,80,I'm going to get a mask for the kids and getting a hat for the kids - I don't have the answers yet. The article does make it seem like the schools aren't making any fucking AMAs based on that.
94,80,"I read a little bit of the article in another language. The point being that if you have the CDC (public health organization) in your family (like the CDC) and the CDC are going to start wasting money on research, you should know that they're avoiding the issue, not the CDC, because they don't want to make a joke about vaccines."
99,80,Isn't it illegal for some people to wear a mask if they are sick?
80,31,"""We're not trying to make the government do what's right or wrong, but I do respect their position on the issue."
80,78,Is this a joke about the government? Is it about them trying to get a hold of that?

99,80,"As you know, the word ""joke"" comes from the phrase ""no joke"""
80,31,"In a way, it is a joke."
80,78,So what's the point of it? Does the NRA care about protecting people? Is it a joke because they are trying to convince people to do something unless they are allowed to do it?
83,80,"As someone who has defended the government, it is very frustrating when you realize that it is actually a joke."
90,80,I'm going to get a mask for my kids and get one for my kids. I'm going to get a hat for the kids and get one for the kids in public because of a skunk being in the school.
94,80,There is a lot of stuff that doesn't happen anywhere except in America.
99,80,Vaccination is a legitimate medical necessity.
