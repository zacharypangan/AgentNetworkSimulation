32,19,This is an extremely complicated and disgraceful question that people who are under the influence of this cult deserve to answer.
47,19,"OP's favorite is the one in the background. I am not even a big fan of the twitchcon, I just read this a few times."
50,19,That's one way to stop the spread of a virus.
53,19,I don't think the mask will stop the flu and I don't think it's an issue that's been discussed with any professional or academic players about it.
55,19,"> I'd be shocked if I didn't stop wearing a mask, and then if I could I'd be doing the same."
78,19,That's pretty much why I get a sarcastic response. The sarcasm makes me happy. I want to be in the r/advices so bad Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
98,19,He must take it off at work because he's in pain from working so long
19,2,"I'm not even a huge fan of the twitchcon, I just read this a few times. That's one way to stop the spread of a virus. I don't think it's an issue that's been discussed with any professional or academic players about it."
19,5,I don't really agree with what he said. I want to see it. The person who fucked up and blew off their masks has no knowledge of the subject.
19,14,"There are 2 problems. Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of a virus, it's useless and I hate it."
32,19,"A few weeks ago I was with an old guy who was going to visit him for his birthday and she said he wasn't going to go back to school for him. he was a bloke, and the old guy was going to visit him and say he had a mask but his friends said he couldn't get away from the bloke or his mask and he just made out with him. he told me that the rest of the story was his You need to get your head around a lot of people on a medical scale, so you don't need to"
47,19,"This was actually the one that made me laugh out loud, while I was in Washington, when a CDC spokesperson suggested that you wear a mask for a few months if you really wanted to. That was part of the doc's response."
50,19,A mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
53,19,"We need to have more people who understand the government's role in the spread of the virus. If we start to get rid of the weed, eh?"
55,19,I have a scavenger hunt on my campus in Florida where a scavenger hunter robbed my girlfriend of his birthday. She had a scavenger hunt and she was very terrified he would get sick by putting the face mask on his face. I had to walk out of the car to get her to show me a scavenger hunt.
78,19,... the only reason it isn't effective is because it prevents an infectious disease from spreading.
98,19,"My name is mcdonald, and I work in an office that has a mask."
19,2,I've always argued that a mask is not an effective way to stop the spread of a virus.
19,5,"As a nfl player, I threw away my mask about a month ago. I have no idea why anyone would wear a mask. I would be a bit skeptical. I'm a fan of any type of sport, but I don't want to see the guy in the background."
19,14,It doesn't help if it stops a virus. It stops people from finding a cure or having an infection. It just means that people are more likely to just find another virus.
32,19,> This is an extremely complicated and disgraceful question that people who are under the influence of this cult deserve to answer.
47,19,"Well, I want to say that the first thing you did was actually tell the people who are interested in the Vaccines that if they have a mask you are not supposed to wear. That's one of the reasons I think the government should be doing it."
50,19,It seems like people are assuming the federal government actually voted to allow this to happen because it is a very legitimate measure.
53,19,I've had to wear a mask once. I didn't want to go to the police in the first place. I just found the first sentence in that sub to be completely uninformed.
55,19,"Isn't that a big deal, but it's a big deal for a country where there isn't a whole lot of sex. It's not a big deal."
78,19,I don't know what to do with this but you're being really sarcastic - there's a lot of information in here that points to that.
98,19,"Aside from the ""Mask the man to put off his mask"" part, people who are sick of a white guy wearing a mask think they're sexist."
19,2,I'm not sure what's at issue with the CDC scavenging in that place because of some of their reeds. It's just a cult.
19,5,"Isn't that a big deal, but it's not a big deal. If you're just going to be honest with me, I'm going to put up with a few questions like this: I don't see what this is - and why this is not a big deal for you, as a person with a lot of personal responsibility and responsibility, and the fact that you're the one who got the word out that it's a big deal to you that people should be ashamed of their own feelings."
19,14,i think the best thing to do about this is to keep it from happening to anyone who is interested in the vaccination. you're not going to find anything good about it...

47,19,I think this is the most appropriate response - and I'm surprised it came across that way.
50,19,">Is it illegal in the U.S., it can be used to protect people from diseases like AIDS."
53,19,"""Phoenix infected"" with VTC (Vet Ebola) because it can infected people with it, or if you haven't already, by forcing people to wear a mask, they will not go to the police. ""I'm just glad that he didn't wear a mask as part of the effort to stop it."""
55,19,"I think your comment was a bit misleading, in that they were not in any way hostile."
78,19,">Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of a virus, it's useless and I hate it."
98,19,There's a joke somewhere here.
19,2,">Is it illegal in the U.S., it can be used to protect people from diseases like AIDS."
19,5,"No, the government is just going to make some changes to fix the masks. So to be fair it's not like I'm sarcastic."

32,19,"I am a Republican, but I do not agree that a man who wears a mask is a politician. Trump has a long history of doing things that aren't sexist and are incredibly damaging to the democrat party and the republicans. He's a democrat."
47,19,I'm a doctor and I'm not a doctor. I have no idea what the reason for this is.
50,19,">Is it illegal in the U.S., it can be used to protect people from diseases like AIDS. The issue is, you're wearing a mask."
53,19,A simple message about the need to use the government as a tool in the fight against HIV is:
55,19,"I know what you mean, but I am going to make a statement here."
78,19,"We all eve a mask at least once a year in our country, and a big part of it is the protection we give our children. I'm pretty sure the idea of a vaccination in the US is not really a joke because there isn't much they can do in that regard. I mean, unless they use that as an excuse to not support the vaccination. I'm pretty sure they would support vaccinating the people who do it because it does nothing to save them from sanity."
98,19,You say the entire movie is ridiculous.

19,5,"I see your point - even though he doesn't think I like what he did, it doesn't make him a politician."
19,14,"oh wow, it's so hard to put a mask on, it's actually very nice. The whole idea of a mask is the same thing as a racial mask in the US."
32,19,He's being an asshole. He isn't a man who needs to be slapped with a mask because he is in a cult. He has no right to change his opinions.
47,19,"""People have to think about their own personal health in order to protect themselves, which is the point I was trying to make. Vaccines are not a great idea. The only thing that really seems to work in this thread is how we make things a little easier and less dangerous. And why wouldn't we be doing the same thing?"""
50,19,">Is it illegal in the U.S., it can be used to protect people from diseases like AIDS."
53,19,It sounds like the ACA was designed to stop HIV in America. They've been there and done that. But they're going to continue preventing it and that's what's going on. There are many people stooge it.
55,19,It's actually one of the few times the government is being able to make something of it.
78,19,"> I do not know how many people in DC are aware of this, but it is a very common problem. I think the whole thing is 'It seems to make the ACA work'... You are so witty. I'm a witty kid, but I want to try to get the truth out of it. It seems that the one-handed government policy that is implementing in the US is to allow people to have a helmet in public. I'm a doctor who's been in the military and have had my head tattooed off with a mask"
98,19,"If a mask prevents the spread of a virus, if a person is not sick of a black guy with a mask, then no, it is not a joke. It is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus, which it is not."
19,2,"It's not illegal in the US, it can be used to prevent the spread of AIDS. No, the government is just going to make some changes to fix the masks. So to be fair it's not like I'm sarcastic."
19,5,"There are plenty of nfl players, and that is why they wear a mask in the first place. Generally speaking a mask is more than a hat."
19,14,...and it doesn't stop people from finding a cure or having an infection.
32,19,CANNOTANSWER - I'm really not sure about the other quotes. What's interesting is they just mention the same thing.
47,19,The CDC and the EPA have a LOT to talk about. I guess a big part of the problem is that they're still trying to convince people to go to the doctor to protect themselves in a way that they can't do. There has been some people who say that the CDC has no mandate to protect people and have to take a little time to talk with people. Then they go to the doctor to make a statement about a policy and the benefits they are getting.
50,19,"It's been a while, but I think that the Obama Administration is really working hard to fix it."
53,19,"[Click on any subreddit in your subreddit that has a subreddit.](http://www.reddit.com/r/faddit/) I'm in Georgia. I hate to think the president is going to turn himself in on a mask because it would make people look terrible. The joke is in a nebulous way. Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it. It's very much sexist and insulting."
55,19,... because the EPA isn't using a word that implies it's a sexist tactic. It's useless and I hate it.
78,19,"I don't understand your point, but I do understand that you are being really sarcastic. CANNOTANSWER](http://www.twitchcon.org/) They are sarcastic. I just don't understand their point in the ACA. It is not an easy thing to do, but it can be done. The only real issue is to get people in the military to wear their masks. In general, if they are the first ones to have a hooded shirt or pants on they are considered to be a bit risky."
98,19,I'd like to suggest that you read the op
19,2,"The CDC : ""Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."""
19,5,I'm a doctor who's been in the military and have had my head tattooed off with a mask.
19,14,The government is actively trying to make the people of America more inquisitive about vaccinations. People like these are more likely to bleed and have more infections than the CDC or other major body builders. It's a good way to educate people about vaccinations.
32,19,I think they're saying they think it's really stupid that the Democrats are using their money on him to keep the president afloat.
47,19,"People have to think about their own personal health in order to protect themselves, which is the point I was trying to make. Vaccines are not really an alternative. They’re just used to people with serious health problems. A good deal of people don’t have a choice. Vaccines are not really an effective tool in that respect."
50,19,I am a huge pro-vaccine supporter of the CDC.
53,19,"Is the point of using this to make the situation so different? It's very much a joke, and is completely inappropriate. It sounds like the ACA was designed to stop HIV in America."
55,19,I have never heard of the EPA or any of the CDC doing this.
78,19,That's how a narrator writes it.
98,19,Why do you think this is a petty joke?
19,2,"It was in the ACA that is the most popular one in the US. I'm not saying that is true, but I will say that it's a very good way to stop the spread of AIDS."
19,5,"I'm not a huge fan of football, but I have seen them in a few more."
19,14,You can't just have a hat on in public in order to prevent an infection
32,19,The people are actually being sexist and racist.
47,19,"There is nothing wrong with this. I think it's a good idea to get your child on one side of the fence and get the CDC to help you keep your child away from the dangers of HIV/AIDS, instead of having it vaccinated. But, this is a dangerous disease, and a dangerous disease. I think you should go to the doctor and reassess the risks for your child."
50,19,Is the CDC going to stop? I have no idea.
53,19,Vaccination is still a law in the U.S. It's illegal to wear a mask if you are going to be getting a diagnosis and then trying to get you out of a coma. This is a joke.
55,19,'I think the point of this is that it's a petty joke. Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of a virus. Hopefully it doesn't come across as petty or ridiculous. He's doing the right thing by not wearing a mask.
78,19,"""A person who has never done it will have a bad time."""
98,19,Is it possible that you are sick of hearing shit about this kind of thing happening here?
19,2,"I don't see how this has anything to do with being sick and not having a mask, that's for sure."
19,5,You've got the right to be concerned if the problem becomes worse when people do it. It's going to be a petty shit show.
19,14,"I just saw this on a Facebook event in a town on an AKR forum where a guy sat behind a guy and said, ""We've already got to use masks"" to fight the AIDS epidemic. I thought he was pointing out the obvious thing in the AMA: ""The people are actually being sexist and racist."" The CDC's point was, ""They are trying to make the people of America more inquisitive about vaccinations. People like these are more likely to bleed and have more infections than the CDC or other major"

19,2,I think you're just doing the right thing. This was on Facebook at 11am and was posted on a Facebook page on that very day.
19,5,"There's a video at r/politics where the guys who actually wear a mask are able to explain to you the nature of their identity and what they've been doing in that video, which explains why they don't wear their masks. So, just think about it."
19,14,"I don't think this guy has a single point here. He has been asked if he'd shave the front of his head, and the person that is going to be ejected should be called out on the idea of going on this trip. That's a very unsettling and potentially ill-informed comment on a joke."
32,19,"Is it even funny? I mean, I didn't say anything about the sexistness. I just said it's a fucking joke."
47,19,That's a whole new kind of joke. This is a whole new kind of joke.
50,19,A big part of the AMA was about the CDC in my school.
53,19,I think I see what you're saying here. If we are going to use this to stop the outbreak then we're going to end up with more deaths and more medical expenses and more health care.
55,19,>I'm a doctor and I don't really believe in a mask.
78,19,Its not a joke. The ACA is just an attempt to stop the spread of a virus.The ACA is just an attempt to stop the spread of a virus.
98,19,OP's post made me smile.
19,2,"The ""Mask"" thing is a crappy joke. I didn't mean ""I don't want to see it"". I was just making fun of the joke."

47,19,I'm gonna start a series of people's faces when it comes to Vaccines vs AIDS.
50,19,I don't think it's a joke. I don't think it's a joke.
53,19,Is the ACA really a joke?
55,19,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
78,19,I can't help but wonder why this isn't a joke. It's basically telling people to read through and understand that not everything about the ACA is a joke.

50,19,AMA isn't funny. It's a joke. The AMA isn't funny. The AMA is a joke.
53,19,The ACA ad is pretty much the most obvious part of the Obama presidency. But the question is whether Obama's a racist or a racist as a president. That's the point here.
55,19,It sounds like a joke. It's a joke.
