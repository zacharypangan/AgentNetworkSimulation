64,14,I have an issue with people saying that a mask has nothing to do with the government. The problem is with people telling them that it's something that's not about being a good government.
65,14,A mask is not mandatory. A mask is not mandatory.
68,14,The movie is interesting to read and it's not just about the military. The actors are the one who aren't necessarily talking about the government if they're talking about it.

79,14,It's actually more important to keep your mouth shut. It's just because a mask is a part of the government's work. The US has very many policies against a virus that are being used in Africa for a long time.

15,14,"""Some people in this movie have good points about the government, not 'wearing a mask'."""
19,14,The government is actively trying to make the people of America more inquisitive about vaccinations. People like these are more likely to bleed and have more infections than the CDC or other major body builders. It's a good way to educate people about vaccinations.

55,14,I have an opinion that the government needs to be able to put their hands on a mask that does nothing to stop the spread of a virus. Hopefully it doesn't come across as petty or ridiculous.
63,14,You seem to be getting the wrong kind of joke. People don't need a mask. Vaccination is actually pretty good for preventing the spread of a virus.
