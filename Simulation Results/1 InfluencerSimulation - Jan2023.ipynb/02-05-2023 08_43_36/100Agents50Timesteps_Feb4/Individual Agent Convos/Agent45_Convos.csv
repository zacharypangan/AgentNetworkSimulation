45,1,"I don't think that 'protect other people' would be a good description of 'protect other people'. I was a student and got a mask to wear to school, but I wasn't wearing one for school anymore."
45,2,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
45,7,Is it ok that you wear a mask? Or are you a person with a mask?
45,17,"if you wear a mask and are going to go to a game or sports event, the helmet would be a lifesaver."

45,26,You should wear a mask too!

45,38,He is a bad person for trying to stop the spread of a virus.
45,39,You have a mask? What are you wearing a mask for?
45,40,...and now we can get rid of them. I have a face mask on for a reason and it's a lot safer than just wearing a prank mask on my own person.
48,45,I'm surprised not all coaches would wear a mask that protects their players. I think it explains it better.
54,45,He got it from the govt. for his face

85,45,The only thing you can do that is a mask and wear it if you can and it can keep your nose clear and not get a nasty cold or a rash.
92,45,i know i am against vacks mandates but in my opinion it is a bad idea to have a gun and a mask on and have them banned from public transportation and all that but the same thing is going on with vacks mandates.
95,45,I was really disappointed when I read this

45,17,I would love to wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus. The helmet would save my face. Why would a person with a mask not wear a mask?
45,22,"As far as i know, people wear masks all the time."
45,26,"I think this is a bit silly, but in general, people would wear a mask to protect their own skin and body, so what would happen to a face mask?"
45,27,I'm actually a coach and I wear a mask at every single event. I want to wear the mask to protect the players from a virus or an infection but not to prevent it from spreading. But I'm trying to explain what the role of masks are in protecting the players because I think it is a good idea to get it in public and help prevent a virus or disease.
45,35,"If you are willing to wear a mask as a coach, just a little reminder that you're only willing to wear a mask when the wind blows. If you go for a run, and you get a run, and you go for a run, you don't want to see a shot. You aren't going to lose your license, which is the only thing you can do when you have a mask. And it is a real problem that is not happening at this point in your life, so you should be a coach."
45,38,I have a face mask on for a reason and it's a lot safer than just wearing a prank mask on my own person.
45,39,Why do you think the government should want to ban guns and masks?
45,40,Is this something the US Department of Health and Human Services could do to prevent the spread of a virus? The way you describe it sounds like a sexist and ineffective neoconservative agenda.
48,45,I like this article very much.
54,45,"I've always heard the phrase. ""I wear my mask when I m in public lawmaker who isn't wearing his mask in public says"" Wearing a mask outside of a public place, but not a federal office is just a ridiculous dick move."
64,45,One of the most important pieces of government legislation.
70,45,OP is wrong. A helmet is a mask worn by officials.

45,7,I like you but I think the idea of a face mask being worn as a protective mask is absurd.

45,40,Why would a person not wear a mask?
48,45,"The word ""masked"" is used by an official to protect players. It's not the same as a full head mask, which is not true of some sports."
54,45,I was a guy who was wearing a mask at the office for a friend. The best thing about a mask is the fact that it is not contagious. Are you kidding me?
64,45,I like this sub for people with a real connection to politics
70,45,That's right. You don't like the guy who wears a mask. That's not his way to move.

85,45,I think the obama is being sarcastic with what you are saying.
92,45,"I'm not saying this is an innocuous or a bad idea, but a lot of people who aren't able to afford a mask and a scarf are probably being sued by the government. You're being a fucking idiot. I just want you to know that people who do this will be fired in a flash for having a mask and a scarf."
95,45,"In order for people to get sick, they must wear a mask. In this context, he should wear a mask outside or in his car, where a doctor is on duty for a day. He should always put one on the driver's seat so the doctor can see the person."
96,45,I've never been to a game where I had to wear a mask and I actually didn't.

45,1,This guy is a scumbag.
45,2,I've never been to a game where I'm wearing a mask and a scarf. I can't figure out what a prank is.
45,7,Why do people wear masks? Because it's not like there are rules about wearing them in public.

45,27,I am just wondering if there is a way for the federal government to use a mask to protect people in the event of a virus being spread.
45,35,I have to apologize but op doesn't understand why someone's getting fired for not wearing a mask in their office...

48,45,"This is a great idea. But, if you wear a mask, you're at the risk of becoming a tripped immigrant and I don't think you understand. Basically, you get to be a part of the process that allows you to spread a virus that you don't already have a history with."

70,45,I didn't post a question - I was asking if you guys wear masks - but the only thing worse than a helmet on your head is being on your back.
71,45,"I am just going to be honest with you: I want you to stop thinking of the government. If they won't keep up with the government, I'm going to be able to change this."
85,45,"I don't understand how the president has a phobia to do that but he seems to be a pretty normal person. I think the most important part of a healthy population is the freedom of choice. It's a very powerful and important thing to protect, but the people that are infected can suffer by that insecurity and are uninsured. I don't understand how that would be a good idea. Apparently, it's because he wants to protect the people. But the American people aren't immune to it. This has been around for several years"
92,45,I just want you to know that people who do this will be fired in a flash for having a mask and a scarf.
95,45,"The only way we can stop the spread of a virus is to put a shield on all the people that want to try to prevent it.

I mean, a vaccinated person would probably go there anyway and have an extra 100-200 vaccines. And for those who are still sick, they'll put on a mask. That's probably"

So he can't wear a mask in a government environment because he has a fear of being in a public place. Because if the public does not like it, it's not contagious and thus should be treated as such.

85,45,"This article says that if you were able to make a joke about a mask for the upcoming campaign, and it would have been appropriate for the campaign, a ""Non-Civil"" hat might work, but it would be too much for the CDC."

95,45,It sounds like there is a very important issue here.
96,45,"You are saying he was a doctor and wanted to go to a game where the gov't mandated a mask, not the football coach."

54,45,It seems like this is some kind of conspiracy to make the government look stupid and not have the proper authority to change it.
64,45,"So, how did you stop the EPA from saying that that the new EPA is not actually in place to enforce it?"
70,45,> I don't like the guy who wears a mask. The issue is that the coach wore a mask because it was uncomfortable and not a proper helmet. It's ridiculous. You are a prick and your lack of self-esteem is ridiculous.

92,45,"I'm really sorry to hear that this is coming up, but I've also heard that the government has a policy that allows people to refuse to wear a mask. They use it for public health reasons, and even then, it is only in response to the threat of a virus."

45,17,A lot of people wear masks because of the fear they face while carrying a virus. That's one of the worst things that can happen in the face of a virus.
45,22,What is a helmet for? Are you saying you're wearing one? Because it's just a mask. I've been wearing it for years. I'm afraid I don't have a choice.

45,38,Vaccination is not required for everyone unless the person is in an advanced stage of a clinical trial.

45,40,I don't get how people get that it isn't an issue with public health and he does nothing about it. He is not a sexist or a sexist person.
48,45,There is some truth to that. The US government has no authority over what the CDC wants and hasn't.
54,45,"My husband and I were married for three years, and we were living on a farm. The gov't resorted to letting us have the right to wear a mask and our private property on the property they are on our property with. We had the right to wear a mask in the home, not in the car. The gov't resorted to it. That's why we still own a huge majority of our own property and the people who live there aren't allowed to do anything illegal."
64,45,"The law states that people need to put on a mask to protect themselves against disease and the effects of a virus. The EPA says that when someone's immune to a virus is not an infection, they should immediately stop using it."
70,45,I am a woman who is very obedient to the idea that the president should wear a mask when he was younger to prevent the spread of a virus.
71,45,>Making a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
85,45,> The CDC has found that people with an infection are more likely to get sick and will pass a vaccination.
92,45,Is a mask part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus?
95,45,"I'm from the US and I'm a fan of the ""Wearing a mask in my car alone"" comment. I feel so gullible about a situation and just hate it. He was on the astroturf as well, so we have that. We should also bring him to a televised press conference on the issue. Wearing a mask outside or in your car alone is not a good idea."
96,45,I want to get some info on this:
100,45,"I had a bad experience, and it was very painful to say the least. I mean, I can't believe I got my vaccination in a couple days, but I've been told that it is now illegal and would be refunded in the next year or two."
45,1,"It's illegal, but you don't need a mask to protect yourself from a virus."
45,2,...and you're being a sexist nerd?
45,7,"This is so weird that the CDC doesn't like to use the word ""man '' on the internet in a funny manner."
45,17,People can wear the mask because they're insecure.
45,22,"It sounds like the US government is attempting to ""save everyone else's health."" Its a prank."
45,26,"It's not a prank, it's an issue with a prank in a way which is a prank."
45,27,"I'm in the US and my husband and I wear masks all the time. I work at a university that only allows for the protection of medical patients at the moment, but that is because they get sick and want to have their mouths slammed through the mouth to keep them from spreading."
45,35,Vaccination is not required for everyone unless the person is in an advanced stage of a clinical trial.
45,38,Is it a prank? Is it a prank or is it not a prank?
45,39,Vaccination is not required for everyone unless the person is in an advanced stage of a clinical trial.
45,40,"There is a huge issue here, I don't understand what you mean by that."
48,45,I think you're confusing a little misleading... if the government wants to take advantage of the public's healthcare. I don't think it's a joke to wear a mask to help prevent a virus.
54,45,"It's not the government's job to prevent a virus, it's the people. It isn't just the government allowing it. It's the government's job to keep people safe - that's why it's invading our country. It's the people who need to be safe."
64,45,"I'm actually from New Zealand, and have seen some of this. I don't think the EPA will be able to impose a mandate on us on the same day that the school board members did."
70,45,"I'm sorry, you are being like him, but that makes it even more outrageous."
71,45,It's all about the money. It's all about the money.
85,45,"I don't think 'they don't seem to understand the point of it. They think that the health system should be able to handle the contaminated population. The problem is that he's just trying to protect the people, not the fetus itself."
92,45,I don't see that as a positive statement but it seems like the government is doing all that. It isn't like the government will ever get involved with the EPA's investigation.
95,45,"I hate this comment a lot. I think it's too much. You say you don't like the idea of a ""good thing"" because if it's a joke, that's too much to ask and don't really understand it. You've said what the joke is."
96,45,"My favorite comment: ""I'm an advocate for the role of helmet in the protection of health care. I'm a defender."""
100,45,I'm gonna be a troll in my 20's.
45,1,"""I don't think that 'protect other people' would be a good description of 'protect other people'."
45,2,It's called a prank.
45,7,And what is that? The EPA will probably get involved with the investigation.
45,17,"I'm in the United States, and I think I have a good reason to wear a mask. But I think wearing a mask to prevent the spread of a virus is a prank, as the EPA has already claimed it is the government's job to protect people who get sick and want to have their mouths slammed through the mouth to keep them from spreading."
45,22,"I don't care that the government wants to take advantage of the health care system, I just want to point out what's going on."
45,26,I want to say this is one of the reasons it's not allowed in most countries because it seems like the CDC is trying to do it in order to make the government look stupid.
45,27,I'm really confused. There's something going on between the two of us:
45,35,I don't think there's enough to say about it. Probably doesn't even sound like a joke. It sounds like a bunch of hoops aimed at making people sick to get away with it. Then it just becomes a prank.
45,38,People are often left out of the conversation because their masks have already been removed from the EPA's data files. It is important that this information be in plain English.
45,39,"No way. We are only doing it to protect people. So, we are not a prank."
45,40,"Is there a way for the federal government to use a mask to protect people in the event of a virus being spread?"""
48,45,"No, this isn't a joke, it's a joke."
54,45,"It's a problem of the government in a few ways. There are good reason to make your employer take advantage of your privacy while you are in your place, and the people who live there haven't been forced to do so yet. You know, so why bother being a liar?"
64,45,I’ve been around this and it seems like the best thing you could do is to post this on a sub that can help your perspective on this issue.
70,45,"I have a friend who plays the president on the plane. He plays him on a race simulator, and he's actually going to be a good player on it, but isn't a great coach. The president he plays for doesn't wear a mask. He's talking about how he has to wear a helmet for himself and how he can wear a mask on his back to avoid injury. I'm sure he's aware that he doesn't wear a mask, but he thinks he's a bad"
71,45,I'm not sure if the joke is real.
85,45,"And while it's great to go on vacation without a mask, we do have to be careful how much people get sick with it, if the people that are infected don't get sick and pass a vaccination."
92,45,"Then you read the rest of the sentence and think, ""Would you be fired for having a mask and a scarf?"""
95,45,"I find it hilarious when the people who hate it are trying to get their way but I don't really see a problem. I want to feel better, but it's a little silly, because it sounds like there is some sort of stigma attached to it."
96,45,There are some big problems with hating and hating. I'd suggest that you try it.
100,45,This is really scary. It sounds like you're the one who's getting the fuck out of the government.
45,1,Wearing a mask in public is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.It's called a prank.
45,2,I want to say this is one of the reasons it's not allowed in most countries because it seems like the CDC is trying to do it in order to make the government look stupid. I’m really confused. There’s something going on between the two of us: I don’t think there’s enough to say about it.
45,7,"The CDC is not in the business of doing this, it is the responsibility of the private sector, and it is not the responsibility of the private sector."
45,17,"You should also write a troll letter to the president asking for a prank and then tell him he needs to wear a mask, but that you're willing to take it."
45,22,The US government has been using a prank on you for a long time. It's called a prank.
45,26,It's a great way to show that the US is not the only country in the world where the government isn't responsible for the care of the people.
45,27,I'm pretty sure this is a joke.
45,35,The first person I was to say this is an American slang term for a prank. I've never heard of anyone arguing about the word prank in terms of how it is used in the United States.
45,38,"My employer has made me wear a mask while we're traveling the country and I've had a couple of trips with my family that I couldn't voluntarily get into. I wore a mask that I could never wear in public and was forced to fuck up because I had a sleeve of pants that went across my back. Then I've had to wear a mask for two weeks and then I don't think I've had an issue with it, since the first time I didn't get it, it makes it difficult to learn"
45,39,Because it is a prank.
45,40,This is just the beginning of what seems like a tangled mess between the CDC and the people who don't like it.
48,45,They aren't just over thinking what a government can do. They are trying to make the government try to make the world less of a joke.
54,45,"I mean, they might just need to repeal the ACA, and we're in the clear."
64,45,I do think that there is a need for the government to implement a 'death prevention' tool.
70,45,"I don't really think a mask is racist, and it's a common misunderstanding among people."
71,45,"“We are not trying to make a situation worse, it's just that we haven't been able to stop the spread of a virus. We have just stopped people from eating and drinking. Then we get the news on the local news and have a job interview. We're starting to have a better feeling about ourselves. “We can’t help you when it comes to the economy. I’ve had good luck in Georgia because I’m a good guy. I can’t wait for my next trip to Georgia”"
85,45,I'm still on reddit and I don't have an answer for you. Please stop.
92,45,They just do it in response to a threat of something serious. What's the joke? No way.
95,45,I would feel pretty stupid not to hear it on tv. It’s kind of like the joke of Trump 'if it was a nice tv show'.
96,45,"There's something about the ""fake news"" that I want to read in a book. But no one will ever do it."
100,45,"I have been sick and I have a fever. I can barely breathe without a mask, but I get the chills when I do it."
45,1,"I'm sorry, but this is all the time I've thought of."
45,2,People are getting to know you through the Internet.
45,7,I think you should write a troll letter to the president asking for a prank and then tell him he needs to wear a mask.
45,17,"You can't say that it's a joke. But when people tell us they are sick, they try to think ""why don't you wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus?"""
45,22,"No, it's a joke."
45,26,"[http://www.fsa.gov/news/report/fsa-report-of-a-vaccine-suicide-by-a-vaccine-surveillance-from-a-vaccine-of-a-vaccine-and-the-amazing-innocence-of-a-vaccine"""

Vaccination isn't really illegal in most countries because it seems like the CDC is trying to do it in order to make the government look stupid. I'm really confused."
45,35,You guys sound like a bit of a fucking fool. They are trying to get the government to stop the spread of a virus. It's like the whole conspiracy of fucking up the country by talking about how the government has a problem.
45,38,"Yes, a mask is a prank."
45,39,"CANNOTANSWER: ""The only way you can protect yourself is by wearing a mask,"" if you can't help it."
45,40,As a troll I'm not sure where you're coming from. You could try sending a sexist nerd an email requesting a prank and then make him think his prank was racist.
48,45,"""This is a classic quote from a book."""
54,45,"Why do people wear masks? It can actually get them to go in the public. If you do, they won't do it. It doesn't prevent it. You have a mask."
64,45,"As a guy who has never heard of the EPA or Trump, it's funny that the Obama administration is making a joke about how much the government has to do with this."
70,45,"It's really, really good to be able to have a conversation with someone who thinks they're a prick."
71,45,Isn't there a place you can take me? I don't know about Georgia. I'm going to Florida for business.
85,45,"I think it's a joke, but it's not a true statement."
92,45,> The president has no reason to take a joke like this seriously. He's the lone wolf who can do what he wants and then continue to do what he wants.
95,45,“Wearing a mask in my car alone is not a good idea.”
96,45,"I do have a problem with it because we should make a big deal out of it, as the whole point of sports is to protect the fans. The NFL sucks. It should be good on its own merits."
100,45,Vaccination isn't a requirement of a government agency. Vaccination is a federal mandate that's not enforceable.
45,1,"I don't think that it's a good idea to make a joke about a prank that is not a joke, it's a joke."
45,2,"I’m a troll, and I am a politician. I’m the President of the US House of Representatives and I can tell you what is wrong with people, a mask and an email that I can’t understand, is a prank. I’m saying I’m not going to tell the president what’s right with me. It’s just a prank."
45,7,I'd be shocked to see that any of these things are still in use and that they have nothing to do with a government.
45,17,"Vaccination is a federal mandate that's not enforceable. And a big part of why I believe this isn't a prank, and I'm not sure if it is a prank. It's just an affront."
45,22,They're doing it for the benefit of the nation's health. The US government sucks.
45,26,"In most countries, a mask is a federal mandate and is not legal in some states."
45,27,I don't see how you could possibly be confused about what it's a joke. But I can see that people are getting to know you via the internet and want to make a joke about them.
45,35,Vaccination isn't actually mandatory for people. It's a prank and a joke. Vaccination isn't actually a mandate of a government agency. Vaccination is a federal mandate that's not enforceable.
45,38,Vaccination is not a requirement of a government agency. It is not enforceable.
45,39,"I'm confused by ""Why do people wear a mask?"
45,40,"It's one thing to do a mask, but another to not wear one. That's another thing to do."
48,45,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I've actually seen the whole story and people are upset, a lot of them are like ""I'm just making fun of the guy who's dressed up as a skunk."" (http://www.mygov.gov/statutes/relevance/index.html)."
54,45,The ACA is just an attempt to stop the spread of a virus. The ACA was a fad. It wasn't what the federal government wanted.
64,45,I think that it's about people getting infected and spreading a virus.
70,45,"In my defense, I was also surprised that the guy was wearing a mask (and the guy was wearing it anyway)."
71,45,"My cousins married to women who didn't live in the country. And the whole ""We're going to die"" thing is a funny one to hear."
85,45,If it was a joke then it would be a joke. A hat isn't a joke.
92,45,"This is why Obama doesn't have a job for the EPA, unless the administration is working hard to get his way."
95,45,"He's getting his head shot in the face with a cloak. That's going to be a terrible joke, because it doesn't make a lot of sense. I'd rather have a laugh at a joke that is completely out of line and out of context, but it's not a joke at all."
96,45,"In this context, I see no reason to believe the NFL is not being good. And I also think that the safety and effectiveness of medical equipment is a major concern for the NFL, since medical equipment is necessary to protect fans."
100,45,Vaccination is not a requirement of a government agency. Vaccination is a federal mandate that's not enforceable.
45,1,"No, it's a joke."
45,2,"A prank involving people doing things they don't want to do. It's a prank, in my opinion. But a prank is something that is a joke and a joke."
45,7,It's a prank to use one of those stuff to make a joke. I think that's the real problem. The US government is incompetent and can't afford to cut ties. You could also get a job as a doctor with no money.
45,17,Vaccination is not a mandate of a government agency. Vaccination is not enforceable.
45,22,"Vaccination isn't a mandate, it's a mandate, the mandate isn't legal."

92,45,"In my opinion, the current administration is simply shaming the EPA."
95,45,If the president doesn't wear a mask in his car alone it's the wrong idea to do so.
96,45,"The problem is that the NFL doesn't have the resources to do any of this, as a whole. It's not like the NFL hasn't had enough funds for the medical equipment, not to mention the nfl hasn't been able to meet the needs of the medical team in the first place."
100,45,"Vaccination is not enforceable. It is not a requirement of a government agency. It is an enforceable mandate. I'm not saying it is a good thing, but it is a good thing."

45,17,This is a joke. It's a joke.

45,40,Vaccination is enforceable.
48,45,There are no regulations for a snob.
54,45,A guy who was wearing a mask in public law school with no experience or even experience would be covered in a mask when the federal government tries to prevent the spread of the virus.
64,45,Why do people think this is funny? People seem to forget that a good example of the EPA is an environmental policy that allows a person to take a public health shot at a government employee and the public can be at a worse time.
70,45,">I don't think he is a bad guy unless he wants to be an idiot, unless he wants to be an idiot. I don't think he is a bad guy."

45,26,"It doesn't sound like it's a prank to get people to wear a mask, it sounds like a joke."
45,27,"The word prank is not a prank unless you have actual tense, e.g. the word ""prank"" means a very basic definition of a prank. That's not a prank, just a fun way to imply something like ""You have the right to go out and buy guns, it's not in the bill of rights"" (here's what he's talking about)."
45,35,Vaccination is not enforceable.
45,38,This is an extremely silly quote.
45,39,Is there a question of what's really going on?
45,40,This is a prank that uses a joke to get people to wear a mask. Vaccination is not enforceable. There are no regulations for a snob. A guy who was wearing a mask in public law school with no experience or even experience would be covered in a mask when the federal government tries to prevent the spread of the virus.
48,45,This is a lot of shit.
54,45,"""The thing about wearing a mask is... you wear it and you eat pizza and you're not healthy?"""
64,45,People would sabotage any sort of public health education they have and then run for office and get all their money and no one should have to deal with this.
70,45,a white guy with an anti-narcotics hat on for the job who has a mask and an actual helmet that has a mask and doesn't need a helmet or to be resigning is probably racist.
71,45,Is it OK to be a good guy and help the poor?
85,45,"The thing is, the ACA was passed and the public was under the impression the president didn't get vaccinated in the first place. In some ways it makes it look like the president is a joke and his phobia is an excuse for it."
92,45,"... I'd like to be your main bf. ""The whole government is not taking responsibility for the safety of Americans, and I am sorry we have to continue doing this."""

45,35,"Yes OP is being naive and the quote is ambiguous because of how OP's sister was talking about it. If the CDC wanted a big hit to the president who wasn't vaccinated, they would just go out and get it done in his office, just like the CDC and the CDC."
