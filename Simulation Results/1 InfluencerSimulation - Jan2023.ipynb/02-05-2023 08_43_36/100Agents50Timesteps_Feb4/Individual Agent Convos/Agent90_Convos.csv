90,43,What state did you live in?
90,46,The government has been campaigning to change the ACA so it's a bad idea to wear the mask to try to fight a virus like this.
90,54,The only reason why they voted against the mask public health order is because they've been exposed to the virus and wanted to use it on their child.

90,78,The sarcasm makes me happy. I want to be in the r/advices so bad
90,80,Is that right? Is it that someone in Douglas County should wear a mask in public places like schools?
91,90,wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus
90,26,The question is how did the mask make his breath come out of the back of his head?
90,38,This is a big problem in many states in the U.S. and Canada because we need a federal mandate to enforce that.

90,46,Does anyone know who's voted against this?
90,54,"I don't care how many school districts they represent, I just think it's not a bad idea."
90,59,One would think that the school was going to shut off their air ducts so that the fecal cords would be made of aluminum for a short period of time?
90,72,The only reason why they voted against the mask public health order is because they've been exposed to the virus and wanted to use it on their child.
90,78,'This is a good reminder of how to get people to stand up for themselves.' I voted for the mask because a school in Douglas County has already given some good advice to people who are in school because they believe that being out on a date for the first time is going to increase their chances of getting HIV/AIDS and have more public health problems and a greater population in the future. I'm surprised that the only reason for those who didn't vote against the ACA were people who didn't vote for the one that was in a community of people who support their choice

90,78,"I wore a mask on my birthday and a friend of mine wore a mask. And when we walked in the street we were clapping in awe when he did that, it shook my heart and I was like oh, this is not okay? I think it was my responsibility to do my own thing."
90,80,I've always believed that this was one of the worst things to happen in the ACA.
91,90,"""Won't a guy get an AMA or TAX in public, so he could not get an AMA, so they did it anyways."""
90,26,It is not a skunk wearing mask. This is a public health measure. It would be a pretty bad idea to wear a mask when there is an outbreak of the flu in a local school.
90,38,... and I'm surprised that the only reason for those who didn't vote against the ACA was people who didn't vote for the one that was in a community of people who support their choice.
90,39,"It's hard to imagine being a skunk on your birthday if you're from the U.S. It's very sad. And I'm also shocked that a guy got an AMA or TAX in public, so he could not get an AMA, so they did it anyways."""
90,43,"I've been in the US for 9 years, and I'm not familiar with the ACA but I've heard that people are still using them for reasons that don't pertain to it."
90,46,"I'm not going to lie, this happened in Denver. It's hard to believe that a state was swayed by the ACA."
90,54,"It's a great reminder to support the right to choose when and where you go. If you don't want to go, you can go to any school where there isn't a mask. It's great to see what your neighbors think. I love that it's good to have a community that support the right to have a mask. I don't think there's much you can do to make the community feel like you are in a good place."

90,80,There's an AMA that comes up every time you are on your birthday party...
91,90,It seems like this is some kind of conspiracy to make the government look stupid and not have the proper authority to change it.
90,26,"It is a public health measure. It would be a pretty bad idea to wear a mask when there is an outbreak of the flu in a local school. It is the best thing to do and will be the only thing to do, regardless of whether it is to prevent the spread of a virus."
90,38,"If you want to know what the issue is with the ACA, get a copy of the ACA. Then you can make the ACA change."
90,39,"It's also interesting to note that many states do not have a law against the use of masks in schools, though some states may have a law that allows for the use of masks."
90,43,"I have a feeling I might be the only one - the only one who isn't gonna get an AMA. Sadly, I'm so sick of the fact that they're still using them in public places, and that is why they have them in public places, even when they're worn on the day they're supposed to go. Clearly, they're not in the right for that."

90,78,This ain't good. You can't be in a place where it's not allowed.

90,43,I just wrote an article about a skunk who swore a mask to my local school on my birthday and she told me to have a backup plan for that.
90,46,"I don't see how it could be that that a doctor could find a way to help them, or that a woman was involved, that's just not acceptable."
90,54,"It's very interesting that the ACA is in place, but I am in the USA. What the ACA is saying is, you can only wear one if the other is not allowed."
90,59,I am in the US as well. I am here to talk about the ACA in my community.
90,72,The public health authority is trying to force a law to prohibit people from getting AMAs and a TAX if it's not allowed.
90,78,You have to vote to change your ACA to a neocon conservative-sanctioned state.
90,80,>Is the issue with the mask in your city really that difficult to work out? Is it is my responsibility to do my own thing.

90,54,I don't think it's a conspiracy either. It's just an odd choice.

90,72,What does the ACA say about wearing a mask in public places?
90,78,Why did the public health board in Douglas County vote against the mask? I guess it doesn't really matter. But why should the school get an AMA?
90,80,Is he really doing this on purpose. Maybe he's fucked out of his element by a skunk?
91,90,"The question is, how does this make the movie about the NRA look stupid?"
90,26,"The article mentions that the school voted against it. They could have voted against it for safety reasons. It's also interesting that the ACA is in place, but I am in the US as well."
90,38,I don't think it's a conspiracy either. It's just an odd choice.
90,39,I've never gotten a TAX/AMA/Askummi at my school. I'm surprised the school's got an AMA/Askummi to make sure the students can get a TAX/AMA to help with the symptoms.
90,43,"This is a good thing, but this is going to happen. This is a good thing, but I'm pretty sure it's not going to happen."
90,46,The state was not swayed by the ACA.
90,54,The school should go to a county school board and get an AMA for a new skunk in their school.
90,59,"It's a little more than that. You know that's just one part of a larger issue: It's more than just a ""shit story,"" it's that the problem is the fact that the law is in place, but the problem is that people still have to vote against it because they think that it is better for everyone."
90,72,"A skunk, like you, would have to take the mask out of your house to wear it."
90,78,"It's probably better to have a conversation with him about it, but it just won't work in this situation. IMO, the movie should be pretty good."
90,80,"No, he's trying to make a point that the issue is not the ACA. There are already a lot of other reasons to support it, including one of removing it from your life."
91,90,"This isn't even in the title. It is just a link to a very vague article by a journalist. There is no such thing as ""the issue of the government being critical of the government but the problems that a skunk guy has."""
90,26,They need to find a new school and get an AMA.
90,38,It's not illegal. They can't keep it in school. They can't do it.
90,39,This is about the skunks getting an AMA in a school and then they have to give it to the police to try to get them off the line.

90,78,"I know there's an article about this a lot, but it's a really short movie. It's a great movie."
90,80,It's kinda like if the article mentions the fact that the school voted against it. They could have voted against it for safety reasons.
91,90,They don't know the rules — and the rules. The EPA and NRA have no authority to change the health care system.
90,26,"I was wondering whether the word ""Hysterical"" was being used in the movie."
90,38,It's just a link to an article by a journalist.
90,39,"I mean, the state is not a good place for skunks to be able to get an AMA in the states. It's still a great opportunity for skunks to get sick. They could have just had some sort of AMA and there were problems with the ACA if they were going to continue that way. But what's interesting is they won't be able to get a AMA because they think that it's bad for the school or even cause a problem with it."

90,54,"I'm not arguing the ACA, I'm just saying the school should get an AMA for a skunk in their school."
90,59,I'm pretty sure it's a movie starring Paul Mendoza that is a skunk-friendly one.
90,72,Then you can go to a county school board and get an AMA for a skunk at your school.
90,78,"I know the people who got skunks, but I'm not sure what I'm going to be talking about here. This is a very sad case and I'd be upset if someone got a skunk in my school to a school and it was a skunk. I'd have to tell them that if I had the ACA I wouldn't have to wear the mask on my birthday, especially when I'd have a skunk on my birthday, and if they were still withheld they'd be shocked."
90,80,"That's a lot of skunks. If a skunk was in a school, it's likely a skunk in a neighborhood. It's not like they are doing it on purpose. I'd go watch a couple if you aren't sure what it is about skunks in a school. It's going to be more or less a skunk thing, a lot more than the movie."
91,90,CANNOTANSWER: The guy that wrote the AMA is referring to a man who is still going to die without the help of a mask. It's not a skunk guy.
90,26,It's really only a movie.
90,38,"It's not illegal to keep it in school, it's not legal to remove it."
90,39,This is about a man who is still going to die without the help of a mask. It's not a skunk guy.
90,43,You've actually read all of the quotes in the movie. I'm so sick of the fact that they're still using them for reasons that don't pertain to it. Is it possible the school is still using them for reasons that don't pertain to it?
90,46,"It's the opposite of ""Hysterical."" It means that it doesn't need to be ""Scary"" or ""Hysterical""."
90,54,I've been reading the AMAs on this sub and it's a lot more than what you are asking.
90,59,That’s not exactly a skunk-friendly movie. The idea of the movie is that the skunks who are in their school would be sick and nauseous if their fecal cords were made of aluminum.
90,72,My skunk friend got caught in a skunks car in the same place as a skunk.
90,78,"I've always said it is a bad idea to wear a mask when you are out on a date for the first time, because I believe in making sure you are not doing something you aren't able to do. But it's really just a video of a skunk getting a new AMA (e.g. a doctor coming in to a school for a diagnosis) at a school. If you're trying to explain to your school, you should use the term ""hip"" instead of ""hip"" because you"
90,80,"I would go see a couple of skunk movies for example. It's interesting to see the difference between ""The article"" and ""Is this a good thing, but this is a good thing"" in terms of removing the ACA."
91,90,I have no clue how to be an unbiased reader of this... but the AMA seems to imply that the government is trying to use the mask to make the government look stupid. So I would think they're putting that nonsense on the NRA's side.

90,43,"I know the other comments are quite good, but I also think the AMA in question is over the top and I don't think it would actually work if the film is more about a skunk. I'm surprised they won't get a AMA because they think that it's bad for the school, or they aren't getting a TAX/AMA/Askummi at their school."

90,54,[(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NativeAskants)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Askants)
90,59,The only problem is that the idea that wearing a mask is bad is the fact that people still have to vote against it because they think that it is better for everyone. This doesn't sound like the issue is a big one.
90,72,The movie and the movie are really funny.
90,78,"IANAL. This has nothing to do with the ACA but with how it affects the public health system. If I see something that says ""skin on my hip"" i will make an exception for it."

90,39,What's your favorite skunk movie?
90,43,I agree that it is a bad idea to wear a mask in public places and that it is not good for the school.
90,46,>I've read the AMAs on this sub and it's a lot more than what you are asking. That’s not exactly a skunk-friendly movie.
90,54,I agree with /u/GeorgiaWomen'sAskants that wearing a mask is a bad idea and a bad idea. The problem here is that this seems to be in reference to a skunk. The fact that people vote against it doesn't mean the government should be able to change it.
90,59,"I mean... I genuinely don't think that they need to get an AMA. I know that if they do, they'll probably be saying ""Okay, this is a bit weird but it's not like I'm getting a TAX or AMA."". I know that's a lot of people in a school who aren't paying attention. But it is a very similar problem in that they're making a bunch of jokes about the skunks. I do think the biggest problem is that they're making fun of"

91,90,Then why don't the skunk guy just get the mask? The skunk guy doesn't get an AMA. The skunk guy doesn't get a mask because he's sick. The NRA is a bunch of terrorists.

90,54,This isn't a conspiracy to have the government change it.
90,59,he didnt get an AMA in a skunk-friendly movie.
90,72,"People who think that ""wearing a mask"" is a bad idea are not going to abide by the ACA, but that's not what it says."
90,78,"I believe the ACA was passed by a board of education, the CDC, a school board, and a lobbyist. It's not the same thing as the ACA, and a tad too big for a skunk movie."
90,80,"I don't see any problem with having people in public places wear masks, though I believe in getting a medical device for the kids, and getting one for the kids in public because of a skunk being in the school."
91,90,The NRA is actually a group of terrorists.
90,26,I disagree. It's not the best thing to do in a skunk movie and is not a good idea. It's just a bunch of jokes.
90,38,"The problem is that they're making fun of the movie. I don't think they need to get an AMA, they shouldn't. I think that's the problem, and that's the problem."

90,43,"The AMA and AMA are only for a few reasons. They are for not doing so, but to get an AMA because people are saying ""I'm not gonna get an AMA. "" and they're also trying to justify why people are using it as a form of protection from being attacked or hurt."""
90,46,"In my school, students would dress with a mask and have the doctors on hand for emergencies. They would be in a position to get medical attention. I was in a very unresolved situation with the class, and a counselor volunteered to do a medical examination to a skunk. I never saw a skunk in the same room that the school teachers did. That would make it more difficult to get in the classroom. That was the first thing that popped into my head when I had to go to the store to get a medicine."
90,54,I don't understand why they didn't get an AMA about the skunk. Is there a reason for them to get a skunk AMA?
90,59,"This is about a skunk, a man with a mask, a skunk-friendly movie starring Paul Mendoza."
90,72,"The ACA says that AMAs are allowed in public spaces, but they're not mandatory."
90,78,"It's not about whether to wear a mask to make sure it's safe or not. It's about whether the health board should be allowed to use it to make sure it's safe, as opposed to the public health board not. It's all about a guy who's never done it himself because he doesn't have to go to a school, but who's allowed to go to a school. Usually the neocon abolitionists in the schools use it as a distraction from the people who think they're doing something bad"
90,80,I'm in the US and a lawyer in AZ.
91,90,It's a good story - and I know the story is very dark. I can't get past that.

90,38,"It's not illegal to keep it in school, it's not legal to remove it."
90,39,"I'm not going to try to cite any evidence or answer what the government actually did. I think I was able to find evidence to go with the story, but to my knowledge this is a really bad idea. I think you should not have heard about it. It's a movie and a lot of kids have to make it public."
90,43,I'm not sure about that but I can't understand why these things would be done. Why would they want people to go to school without seeing a skunk and instead get sick of it because of it.
90,46,"CANNOTANSWER : ""I'm in the US and skunks wearing masks?"
90,54,"The ""skunk AMA"" for the skunk is actually a video game starring Paul Mendoza."

90,78,"The ACA would be a bad idea if it were in the hands of the school, not the people in the school. It would be more of an advertisement. But if they were in the ACA, it would be an AMA."

90,46,"You are making this post, you are arguing a lot, citing a lot of arguments from other articles to argue that the ACA should be repealed to eliminate bullying.

90,54,"AMAs are very important, and can be a very useful way of saying things."
90,59,It's also a good idea to make it a little more public. A lot of schools are swayed by the ACA.
90,72,"""Mom, do you ever want an AMA for someone? I don't think you have to believe the ACA to be effective."""
90,78,I’d like to give you a tip on how to get AMAs in the right places.
90,80,I think a AMA is better than a medical device. The AMA is better than a hat-off AMA.
91,90,I think the AMA and the article imply that the government is trying to make the US government look stupid. They are trying to make the US government look stupid. They are trying to make the US government look stupid. They are trying to make the US government look stupid.
90,26,"The article doesn't say that ""Skunk AMA"" is a good idea. It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. It is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
90,38,The article is misleading and misleading. The headlines are misleading and misleading.

90,43,"If it were a public health issue that didn't get repealed by Congress, I'd be getting it removed from a list of things people do in public health issues like drug use, and child protection."
90,46,You don't know why you're so sensitive about skunks.
90,54,"AMA's are important, and can be a very useful way of saying things. It’s also a good idea to make it a little more public."
90,59,"[No, the article is misleading, it says the NRA are a terrorist group.](http://www.nazi.ed.gov/reg/index.php?q=en.azraq&n=rb&n=rb&n=rb&n=rb]."
90,72,"I've been going to the school and AMA'ing a skunk to my daughter, and all the skunks will get into my head unless I get a teddy bear or a shovel or some other wacky thing to eat."
90,78,"""[The ACA] is about a lack of a political agenda.'''"
90,80,They are trying to get the government to do everything they can to stop.
91,90,"There's no such thing as ""the issue of the government being critical of the government but the problems that a skunk guy has."","
90,26,ACA has nothing to do with the government and is a criminal offense.
90,38,I’m just going to keep thinking about it for a second.
90,39,"""This is the second time the skunk has been wearing the mask in public, so I could have voted against it for safety reasons."", ""Is that right? Is it that someone in Douglas County should wear a mask in public, though some states may have a law that allows for the use of a mask."", ""I think it’s hard to imagine being a skunk on your birthday if you’re from the U.S. It’s very sad. And I’m"
90,43,"It seems that AMAs are an attempt to show the truth. Specifically, they're not a public health issue."
90,46,Then I see the video games starring Paul Mendoza. [Did you see the movie starring Paul Mendoza?
90,54,AMAs are often useful and useful. They can even get people to retort that they suck at it.
90,59,It's a simple and accurate way to put it.
90,72,"""I feel that the message AMA's do not help the public health issue. The article is misleading and the headlines are misleading. I think it's a good thing to make it a little more public."
90,78,"The first paragraph is essentially a rant, essentially stating why the government isn't taking responsibility for the safety of Americans."
90,80,I'm going to get a mask for the kids and getting a hat for the kids - I don't have the answers yet. The article does make it seem like the schools aren't making any fucking AMAs based on that.
91,90,"What I'm not trying to say is ""I'm not sure what to think. You're right that it's a lot of nonsense and I think the article is simply telling a joke, but the article seems to imply that the government is trying to make the US government look stupid. They are trying to make the US government look stupid. They are trying to make the US government look stupid."""
90,26,I'm the father of the skunk. I'm still in the school.
90,38,"In the article: ""This is a big problem in many states in the U.S. and Canada because we need a federal mandate to enforce."""
90,39,What is the major difference between wearing a mask and a restraining order?
90,43,"I'd like to point out that the AMA is not about the ACA, it's about people who voted against the ACA."
90,46,"The NRA AMA has been in the news, and the AMAs are not working. AMAs are used to promote public safety but the NRA has no control over public health. The AMA has been a major part of bringing awareness to the issue of anti-abuse. ""This isn't a skunk-friendly movie."" ""The AMA isn't about skunks."
90,54,"No. The AMA is a satire to get people to do the right thing, rather than an AMA. That would be very skewed."
90,59,I feel like the worst part of the story is that it was too close to the ACA and that the school is doing nothing to help the school.
90,72,"CANNOTANSWER: ""We ARE ALL THE WAY TO STOP THE DISPUTE FROM SICKNESS CANNOTANSWER:"
90,78,"The first paragraph of the article is misleading. It doesn't say ''the ACA is a bad idea''. It says ''the problem is that they're making fun of the movie'', which is why they're making fun of the movie."
90,80,I'm also a lawyer in Arizona.
91,90,"In a sense, this AMA was not intended to be the first in a trilogy. It's the first in three, with the opening in four."
90,26,"“It sounds like the school is being apathetic about the movie. The article mentions that the school voted against it. They could have voted against it for safety reasons. It's also interesting that the ACA is in place, but I am in the US as well.”"
90,38,"""Wearing a mask in public, so I could have voted against it for safety reasons."""
90,39,A restraining order is only necessary for people who have a problem with it.
90,43,"The video game ""Hamlet starring Paul Mendoza"" is a movie about a skunk in public public spaces. Clearly, it's not a good idea to use the mask in public places, and the AMA is about it, and not about it."
90,46,Then there's the fact that in the article it says that a mask in public places is no longer the most effective protection against a virus. It says that wearing a mask in public places is no longer the most effective protection against a virus.
90,54,"There are several issues with the AMAs, and they all seem very conflicting."

90,72,"CANNOTANSWER: ""I'm pretty sure this is the worst idea ever."
90,78,"The movie was a satire, not a real story."
90,80,I'm going to get a mask for my kids and get one for my kids. I'm going to get a hat for the kids and get one for the kids in public because of a skunk being in the school.
91,90,The AMA is just an example of how people view the NRA. The AMA is about the NRA. The AMA is about the EPA and NRA. They have no authority to change the health care system. They are trying to make the US government look stupid.
