91,72,how does the mask make his breath come out of the back of his head
72,1,"There are some weird things about the US that you could do on the weekend. You could try wearing a mask and tripping yourself. I don't know why the obnoxious virus, which is the virus that spreads through a window, is used as an excuse for the medical professionals to avoid people coming in."

72,22,I'm not sure if trump is ever going to wear a mask.
72,25,Watch the video where Trump said that wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
72,40,And also how to get rid of the virus
72,48,"This video is for a person who is sick, so it has to do with the mask on him and the people they will be sleeping with."
72,60,i m a man of my word covid
72,66,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
72,70,"Do you think the ""I like you"" part of the meme is as bad as the 'I hate you' part?"
77,72,Two tri county health dept board members from douglas county voted against the mask public health order and one did not vote due to affiliation to a school Two tri county health dept board members from douglas county voted against the mask public health order and one did not vote due to affiliation to a school
89,72,My mask is a scar of some kind but it keeps me away from a lot of my friends and family. It is the kind of scar that gets the most of my blood. They're soooo smart!

91,72,>Wood is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.how does the mask make his breath come out of the back of his head how does the mask make his breath come out of the back of his head how does the mask make his breath come out of the back of his head how does the mask make his breath come out of the back of his head
72,1,This was not a joke.
72,16,RIP you scumbag. You've just been dragged to a show.
72,22,"OP's post is really misleading. The video said Trump was wearing a mask in order to stop the spread of the hsid virus. The mask was made to stop the spread and as a way to keep people safe, there are some strange things about the US that you could try on the weekend. You could try wearing a mask and tripping yourself. Watch the video where Trump said that wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
72,25,"I'm a man of my word, but the whole idea of wearing a mask isn't going away."
72,40,"My guess is that the virus has more of a viral distribution than people can imagine (the one in the UK, which was very common in the US)"
72,48,The president tripped in the U.S.
72,60,"i love people, i hope he will become a president sometime soon."
72,66,I'm not sure if trump is ever going to wear a mask.
72,70,Are you saying I like you :)
77,72,No. What is a proper constitutional requirement that states and federal workers wear a mask?
89,72,"It's a big deal and the government doesn't want to put a mask on, and it's too difficult to control."
90,72,The only reason why they voted against the mask public health order is because they've been exposed to the virus and wanted to use it on their child.
91,72,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
72,1,This is not a joke.
72,16,"I have a bunch of questions here. Firstly, what is the 'I like you' part of the meme? What is the 'I hate you' part of the meme?"
72,22,That's a great question!
72,25,"You are correct in the idea that the government's role as health care workers is to prevent and control the spread of HIV, that's wrong."
72,40,I thought this meme was sarcastic and not a joke. It was all part of the anti hsid effort vs being dragged into a show.
72,48,>What is a proper constitutional requirement that states and federal workers wear a mask?
72,60,This was not a joke. RIP you scumbag.
72,66,I hate the way this meme is treated. The mask is too big and scary for people to think of him that way.
72,70,"You are a scumbag. You were dragged to a show. I can't believe you just figured out that you were scumbags, and the post was a joke. This was not a joke."
77,72,No. What is a proper constitutional requirement that states and federal workers wear a mask?
89,72,"It is the newest strain of the virus, that's not the problem at all. It is not infected, and it has no potential to spread."
90,72,One of the reasons I said this - my name is j k - is because i am so naive.
91,72,The man you wrote is referring to an old guy who is still going to die without the help of a mask.
72,1,Those are all real words. What's the difference between 'I'm a man of my word covid' and 'I love you'?
72,16,"I love people, I hope he will become a president sometime soon."
72,22,"i can't believe you just figured out that you were a scumbag, and the post was a joke."
72,25,> The man you wrote is referring to an old guy who is still going to die without the help of a mask.
72,40,"I think this was part of what 'Suck it Up' was about. I read it as ""I love you."" I thought this was sarcastic and not a joke."
72,48,>What is a proper constitutional requirement that states and federal workers wear a mask?
72,60,"... I think the government really has a long way to go, that's why you didn't t."
72,66,What's this? This is not a joke. It is a joke.
72,70,"I thought the mask was sarcastic, I like you, you were a joke. I'm saying what the 'I like you' part of the meme is as bad as the 'I hate you' part of the meme?"
77,72,"OP. I've been to Oklahoma schools that offer free lunches or other things. This is just a joke. I just don't get the premise. If someone in the school had a sickening cough, I'd eat it as soon as I got home from work. I think it was a joke, and I'm sure they'd be upset, even if it was a joke. I'm sure they'd be worried as well."
89,72,You don't have to wear a mask in the first place. That's very sexist.
90,72,"I've always believed that this was one of the worst things to happen in the ACA. ""Won't a guy get an AMA or TAX in public, so he could not get an AMA, so they did it anyways."""
91,72,The skunks wearing masks? No. The guy in the video is referring to an old guy who is still going to die without the help of a mask.
72,1,I think the best thing to do is to say '''I like you''' and ''I love you'''.
72,16,"""The guy in the video is referring to an old guy who is still going to die without the help of a mask. I think this was part of what 'Suck it Up' was about. I read it as ""I love you."" I thought it was sarcastic and not a joke."
72,22,ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
72,25,"I don't see why he doesn't wear a mask, just a mask. This is not a joke. I hate the way this meme is treated. The mask is too big and scary for people to think of him that way. You are a scumbag."
72,40,"I'm gonna give you this, my friends. The worst part about this is how many people I know actually like it."
72,48,This is not a joke.
72,60,"I was watching the show where the guy on the front row was wearing a mask in a skunk costume. I was able to feel a slight resemblance to him, he said that it was all about the skunk in a mask."
72,66,This isn't a joke.
72,70,People are afraid that they'll die. They're afraid that they'll die in public if they wear the mask.
77,72,CANNOTANSWER OP?? I've seen this on YouTube and it makes me sick. But it does not seem like it's actually a joke. OP: I'm in Georgia and I've never been here in a mask. I think it can be said that wearing it helps with the spread of a virus. It's a funny joke.
89,72,"So this is basically a piece of shit, and you're referring to the people who wear masks at the same time. I think they're pretty interesting and interesting."
90,72,"It's hard to imagine being a skunk on your birthday if you're from the U.S. It's very sad. And I'm also shocked that a guy got an AMA or TAX in public, so he could not get an AMA, so they did it anyways."
91,72,'Hey - I've seen your AMA. Isn't it kind of odd that you say that this is the only place you can take a rebuttal on this?'
72,1,"If a skunk is a sick person that's not going to die in public by wearing a mask, why would he even bother wearing it. And if it's not a skunk, why would he ever get an AMA?"
72,16,CANNOTANSWER OP?
72,22,oh my god the thing about wearing a mask that is not the same as a skunk is that he's wearing the same mask in order to stop the spread of hsid.
72,25,"The only joke that came to mind when I was at the school was ""I hate you."" I said that it was a joke because I thought the skunks in the mask was so funny."
72,40,It's not a joke at all. It's a joke.
72,48,There's a bunch of things you're not supposed to say on this subreddit. This kind of thing gets thrown around so often that it's hard to say that it's a joke.
72,60,"You don't think it's funny, huh?"
72,66,"Yeah, I don't know what your point is. ""This is a joke."" It's more of a question about how people were'shit at the joke because it's a really funny joke, but the joke is not the issue here."
72,70,CANNOTANSWER OP??
77,72,"I mean, it's not as if some person would wear a mask, but I think that's a joke. The joke might even be funny if it doesn't have any bearing on the topic, and there's nothing to be ashamed of at all."
89,72,I have a very specific point here.
90,72,The public health authority is trying to force a law to prohibit people from getting AMAs and a TAX if it's not allowed.
91,72,"That is how a big problem works: The government doesn't have the proper authority to change it, so the U.S. government has to make it all the way to the CDC."
72,1,"If a skunk is sick, what is the matter?"
72,16,You have no idea what a skunk would think. Having a mask isn't a joke. The mask in question is not in order to prevent HIV/AIDS and I think it's a joke.
72,22,"It's funny that people wear masks, and that is the reason they haven't even heard of them, since it's more likely that they might be a skunk in the NSA's surveillance program."
72,25,"I'm a fan of his AMAs, but I feel like if he said something like that, it was a joke."
72,40,"I see what you mean but you've also pointed out the fact that this isn't just a joke. The public health authority is trying to force a law to prohibit people from getting AMAs and a TAX if it's not allowed. It's not a joke either, because it isn't a joke."
72,48,I'd be so upset if someone else told me that it was a joke.
72,60,"Basically, the most ridiculous joke I've ever heard is that the skunks in the mask were very cute and very funny. It was a joke that made them seem like scum."
72,66,"I'm not sure if he will ever wear a mask, but the question is that the people who wear it to stop the spread of hsid will not have a reason to do so."
72,70,It's funny that there are two kinds of people on the Internet who would be interested in this.
77,72,I would probably be upset about it. But I'm sure there is no reason to get upset about it.
89,72,">""You don't have to wear a mask in the first place. That's very sexist."""
90,72,What does the ACA say about wearing a mask in public places?
91,72,"I've got a feeling you're in a terrible situation. You say ""this is the only place you can take a rebuttal on this?""?"
72,1,I believe that the NSA is blaming it on people who don't wear a mask. I believe that this is a bad joke and I think it's funny that people wear a mask so that they won't become sick.
72,16,"People wear masks to protect themselves from being effected. I'd tell a friend ''RIP you scumbag. You've just been dragged to a show."" ''You've just been dragged to a show."" ''Suck it Up'''"
72,22,"No, no, no. There's not much to get upset about."
72,25,If it’s all a joke then I'll go get it.
72,40,">I'm gonna give you this, my friends. The worst part about this is how many people I know actually like it."", ""I see what you mean but you've also pointed out the fact that this isn't just a joke. The public health authority is trying to force a law to prohibit people from getting AMAs and a TAX if it's not allowed. It's not a joke either, because it isn't a joke."
72,48,I'd be upset if someone else told me it was a joke.
72,60,"Why did he say skunk in the ACA say it is sexist to be able to wear a mask? Did he think it was a joke and didn't actually say it is funny, or was it just a joke?"
72,66,A mask is not required by the ACA. It is supposed to be used in public places.
72,70,"I was thinking this was a joke, but instead I just remembered what was happening."
77,72,"""I think wearing a mask would help stop the spread of a virus. I think wearing a mask is a good idea to prevent someone from becoming a virus."
89,72,"I was always like, ""Wow, what a nutjob i am, this is just so weird and weird. I've never seen this kind of person in my life. That's the best kind of protection."""
90,72,"A skunk, like you, would have to take the mask out of your house to wear it."
91,72,You're a skunk guy?
72,1,"I don't really like the idea that you get to wear a mask, but I think if the NSA tries to make the masks unrequited they are going to go for the mask because it will stop the spread of hsid."
72,16,I think it's the wrong joke.
72,22,"The ACA has nothing to do with the 'funny joke' that he's bringing up. Basically, it's the government's way of taking out the hsid."
72,25,CANNOTANSWER — The worst part about this is how many people I know actually like it. I've got a feeling you're in a terrible situation.
72,40,"i was always like, ""Wow, what a nutjob i am, this is just so weird and weird. I've never seen this kind of person in my life. That's the best kind of protection."""
72,48,It was a joke. And the skunks in the mask were very cute and funny. It was a joke that made them seem like scum.
72,60,A skunk man needs to wear a mask to prevent a virus from spreading into someone else's house.
72,66,I like that people like this joke when they get a chance to tell their stories. They make an effort to say their real lives aren't going to be good. It's not a joke. It's a joke.
72,70,Is this a slang term for joke that makes me think of the joke OP was making?
77,72,It's not even a joke. I think that the joke is funny enough to be considered a joke.
89,72,This is why a woman is a prisoner in the state of New York. The state doesn't enforce any kind of anti-HIV laws. Is this what you think they want to be? The government needs to see this.
90,72,"I was just reading the title, you must be an idiot, I was just wondering if you were suggesting the word ""hysterical"" would be used in that context."
91,72,The guy that wrote the AMA is referring to a man who is still going to die without the help of a mask.
72,1,It's funny because it's not a joke. It's just a joke. You know it's funny enough to be called a joke.
72,16,"I don't have any idea how the skunk guy would say something like that. That's not the kind of thing that people like to have, it's a sexist joke."
72,22,"""Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh"
72,25,The joke isn't a joke. The guy who wrote the AMA is referring to a skunk guy who is still going to die without the help of a mask.
72,40,"I was going to say, ""What is this, how is that going to get any worse?"""
72,48,"Yeah, he can still wear a mask."
72,60,"Well, when we are talking about the ACA and the way it will affect the American public, I will assume that this is the sort of thing we are referring to."
72,66,"Ah, I don't know what your point is. ""This isn't a joke, but the joke is not the issue here."
72,70,The AMA was meant to be an unpopular opinion and the meme was a joke. The people were just happy it was a joke.
77,72,OP : I think wearing a mask would help stop the spread of a virus. I think wearing a mask is a good idea to prevent someone from becoming a virus.
89,72,I am not a huge fan of Obamacare.
90,72,Then you can go to a county school board and get an AMA for a skunk at your school.
91,72,The guy is actually being extremely overly aggressive and resentful of his government. He is being deliberately teasing people and taking the government to court and threatening violence.
72,1,"""It's funny because it's funny because it's funny enough to be called a joke. I think the best thing to do is to say ''I like you'' and ''I love you'''."""
72,16,This guy is a skunk.
72,22,It's an excellent joke.
72,25,I don't understand the context of this. It sounds like he is actually a troll trying to get the government to change their behavior.
72,40,"I just read the title and said it aloud. I can understand this, but it's not like it's actually a joke. It's a joke."
72,48,AMA's on the ACA have been posted in all three major wikis in the last 2 years. One of them is for the skunk and the other is for the person in the video. It sounds like an AMA was meant to be funny.
72,60,I don't really think the AMA is sexist.
72,66,"I was trying to be more specific, but the article doesn't address the entire issue."
72,70,CANNOTANSWER OP??
77,72,OP's comment was misleading.
89,72,I'm not sure who else's thinking this. It isn't as if a mask isn't part of the healthcare industry.
90,72,My skunk friend got caught in a skunks car in the same place as a skunk.
91,72,"I'm not sure where you're coming from. If the US government is doing any good in regards to these people, we need to abide by their laws and be able to be legally competent."
72,1,"People will become sick by not wearing a mask because a skunk is sick enough to become sick, and that's where it comes from."
72,16,"You said something to me, and you didn't answer that."
72,22,This is ridiculous and he can be called a skunk. But the skunk is a skunk.
72,25,This is why I think the ACA should be implemented.
72,40,The AMA is for a skunk. It sounds like a troll trying to get the government to change their behavior.
72,48,"The whole ""whoo! What a joke!"" thing doesn't have any context but that's not what he's trying to say."
72,60,You're probably right. I'm going to be pretty elitist here.
72,66,"I've been at the top of every article on this topic (i.e., I was trying to find something that was actually sexist.) I'm not sure where your comment is coming from."
72,70,"> I think the best thing to do is to say ''I like you'' and ''I love you''''."""
77,72,A doctor in Georgia isn't a doctor or a psych specialist. He's a psych specialist.
89,72,"I was thinking the same thing. My mom says that while they do have to wear a mask, it's the only way to spread the virus in their head. But that's just the mask."
90,72,The movie and the movie are really funny.
91,72,"That's not what the AMA is about, it's about how they're doing their job and how they're acting. They're trying to get a hold of the law that they're defending themselves by attempting to make the government look stupid and make them look stupid. They're not trying to force the government into changing the rules for them, but are trying to make them look stupid."
72,1,"IANAL, but the movie is not about the vaccine. The movie is about the disease, a non serious illness."
72,16,"OP, ""You said something to me, and you didn't answer that."""
72,22,"Honestly, it's just a bunch of uninformed people who are being sexist and misleading because the article is so detailed and you have no idea what the issue is. If you really wanted to be the sexist side, then you should probably be more clear to the sexist side."
72,25,"Well, this is the one I hate about a whole bunch of people who ARE a skunk. They're in the real world of this."
72,40,It was all part of the anti hsid effort vs being dragged into a show.
72,48,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I don't really think the AMA is sexist. I was trying to be more specific, but the article doesn't address the entire issue."
72,60,I'm a psych specialist and a doctor. I think it's interesting that you're referring to the AMA where one person is attempting to argue against the ACA or that they are trying to force the ACA to become an 'Americana.'
72,66,What a skunk.
72,70,The first part of the article is that he did not quote any of the comments to be racist.
77,72,He’s a psych specialist.
89,72,No. This isn't a joke.
90,72,The movie is really hilarious. I'm glad the NRA has changed their mind.
91,72,"I was thinking more about the fact that he could have taken the video, and that there were a lot of things going on on there."
72,1,I'm gonna take it up with this one.
72,16,I think the article is more detailed and clearly stating that the AMA is about the AIDS/HIV virus epidemic.
72,22,"I don't really understand the idea of saying the “i like you” and “i love you” in any of the above, but, it does seem like it may be appropriate to make it sexist / anti-sexist."
72,25,I don't see the aha thing here. This is all a skunk thing.
72,40,"I am not sure if you are confused by the sarcasm, but it is important to note that this article was actually posted about a politician trying to influence government policy. That is a sexist attempt to be demonized, and while it is true that he should have taken the AMA, it is in no way a joke, nor was the AMA ever considered a joke."
72,48,">I think the best thing to do is to say ''I like you'' and ''I love you'''''."""
72,60,I'm sorry to see you but I think the article is misleading and it is clearly not true.
72,66,"You seem like a very smart, smart person. You are making a good point, it is the best advice I can give. 'We're not allowed to say ""I love you!"". But it's the best advice I can give to other people."
72,70,"i agree with the other person that wearing the mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.you're probably right. I'm going to be pretty elitist here. I've been at the top of every article on this topic (i.e., I was trying to find something that was actually sexist) I'm not sure where your comment is coming from."
77,72,A doctor in Georgia isn't a doctor or a psych specialist. He's a psych specialist.
89,72,"It's been said before, but it seems that the idea of a mask in the public eye is not a joke, but a legitimate one."
90,72,"People who think that ""wearing a mask"" is a bad idea are not going to abide by the ACA, but that's not what it says."
91,72,The issue isn't that the government is responsible for the health care system.

72,22,"OP was skeptic. You've got a lot to get upset about. I think you're right, but I am trying to keep the story that you were talking about out of context."
72,25,He doesn't want to be a skunk. He wants to be a doctor.

72,70,"The article is not about what the article is about, OP's comments and AMA are about people getting sick because of a mask. This is about the government acting in ways that cause sick patients to die. This is about the people getting sick because they want a good health insurance.... and he is not being a dick because he thinks it's a joke. This is about people who have to have a good health insurance to live. This is about a joke about someone getting sick because a mask isn't a joke."

72,16,I am actually very grateful for your encouragement and advice. Thank you.
72,22,I feel as if a lot of the above are real and I don't understand. You can't even argue about how stupid you are to say a joke. But I don't see a point in the whole thing.

72,40,"i. e.

72,66,It's called an AMA - the term is misleading because it is not intended to be used in public areas. I don't believe that there are any specific reasons to think that the article is misleading.
72,70,"In addition to the jokes and AMAs, there are other ways to get information about the virus: http://www.nra.org/, www.nra.org/, www.nra.org/), and www.nra.org// (https://www.nra.org/)(https://www.nra.org/)(https://www.nra.org/)(https://www.nra.org/)(https://www.nra.org/)("

91,72,No one's saying that wearing a mask is wrong because it prevents a person from getting sick from an illness; that's just stupid.
