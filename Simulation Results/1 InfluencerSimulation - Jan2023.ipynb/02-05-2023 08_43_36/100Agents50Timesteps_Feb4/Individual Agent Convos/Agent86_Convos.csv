99,86,i mean i'm pretty sure that maroon's had a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that
86,57,"I was the one wearing a mask for a week, and I've been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that. I think I'm pretty sure that maroon's had a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that..."
99,86,"I think it's a pretty good point. That's kind of a general misconception, but there's an underlying message to this post that isn't going to get much attention."
86,57,"Oh ok. I saw the title on a map for the first time. I thought this was the first post I came across, but it made no sense, it was just a joke."
99,86,"So, they are just saying that women have to wear masks for fear of the stigma that it will cause?"
86,57,"Why is there a big difference between a mask and a good mask? You don't even realize that wearing a mask for a few days is such a terrible thing and you can't be in a full mask. You have to be in a full mask, you are not able to wear a mask, you are in a mask. You cannot wear a mask, you can't wear a mask, you can't wear a mask, you are wearing a mask, you are unable to breathe. So, they are just saying that women have"
99,86,I have a good laugh if this is true.
86,57,I don't think that's really the point of this post. It doesn't even say anything about the fact that women have to wear masks for fear of the stigma that it will cause. I think it's just that people are being hypocritical.
99,86,"It's a joke, it's a statement. But why don't you talk about the underlying message?"

99,86,"A petty joke, it's a statement, but the people who want to make them know have to make them."
86,57,"There is no such thing as a good mask in the US. It is a petty joke, it's a statement, but the people who want to make them know have to make them."
99,86,"It seems like a joke. They are trying to get people to do a job they love, but they won't."
86,57,"The post's title is a joke. Clearly there aren't many people who agree with the title, and there are plenty of people who believe there's something wrong with the post. I don't understand why you'd want people to have a hard time breathing. I mean, people want to have the right to wear whatever they want, and they want to do the right thing. You can just ignore them. That doesn't mean it doesn't matter. It's just an underlying message that doesn't matter."
99,86,The way people treat their wives is what I consider as a joke.
86,57,I think some of the jokes are really funny. There are just a lot of good jokes in this subreddit that are just a joke.
99,86,This is not a petty joke. This is a joke.

99,86,"Nope, not a joke. It's a joke."

99,86,It was a joke. I want people to laugh. I don't want people to laugh. It's a joke.

99,86,This is my favorite place to laugh and a really cool place to have a good time.
86,57,"You are not a sexist. You are not a woman. You are a woman, you are a woman. You are not a woman."

86,57,You can't wear a mask in your body but a mask is what you should wear and should be worn under your clothes. That's why you don't want to wear it. I'm a woman. I'm a woman. But that's what my job is.
99,86,"Vaccination isn't a government requirement. You can go to TX and not go. The federal government is in control, and you can go without a mask."
86,57,"I like your style. What do you think of it? It's a funny joke, and I think the humor is funny too, and some people don't even know. A lot of women on reddit like to laugh but the jokes are funny because they have a big personality."
99,86,It's a joke. The CDC is pushing it.
86,57,"I mean, people who don't understand why people don't wear masks are getting a real response like they can on a map - they don't understand why people can't. It isn't a joke, it is a statement, but people who want to make them know have to make them know. It's a joke."

99,86,I'm a big anti-vaccination advocate. I have a feeling that you're just the only one who knows what this is about.
86,57,Yes. It is a joke.
99,86,People who do not want to go to a health event without a mask are the only people who are willing to betray them.
86,57,The title of the post isn't a joke.
99,86,"I just want to add that as I think more of the people who are in this thread are saying that wearing the mask is a 'dangerous idea', and that this is the best way to go about doing it as a joke, not as an excuse. It seems like a reasonable way to go about it and a good way to encourage people to be interested in it."
86,57,"""...The way people treat their wives is what I consider as a joke."
99,86,"It's not a joke, but it's not a joke. If a government official is a joke they should be in a position to push the issue of vaccination, and then take the money out of it."
86,57,It's called a joke. It's a joke.
99,86,The government is trying to make vaccine enforceable and then take money out of the money that comes out of the money.
86,57,"I thought this was the first post I came across, but it made no sense, it was just a joke."
99,86,It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.
86,57,Well this is a joke. That's a joke.
99,86,"I've been in the minority here, but it's been a while. I've had some good conversations with people who have had sex with their bf and have some really fun, I can't stand having sex with people with a mask."
86,57,It's all a joke.
99,86,What's wrong with wearing a mask? The guy who's wearing it is getting a kick out of the joke.
86,57,"There are lots of sexist jokes out there. I mean, I think a lot of women wear masks and I think a good few people have to wear them, but the majority of the people who don't like wearing a mask think it's a good idea."
99,86,That's pretty funny. It reminds me of the time when I was a kid where everyone was in a hurry to get a vaccine.
86,57,"It sounds like the government was using the word mask for a long time, which would have been a joke as the word came to mean something like 'as long as you can have a mask'. You don't have to wear a mask because that means a'man in a mask', you can't wear a mask and you are in a mask.'"
99,86,It's a joke. There are two kinds of people - you can get vaccinated and then you can go without a mask. You can go without a mask and still have a good time without a mask.
86,57,It's a joke.
99,86,"We have the ""Making a joke"" in Texas. Is that really relevant? Is it? It's a joke, because it's the most ridiculous thing you can say."
86,57,It's all a joke. It's a joke. This is just a joke.
99,86,I think the best way to explain it is to have a dialogue with people on the Internet about it.
86,57,"You see a lot of people on this sub are really baffling. It's an awful thing to have to wear a mask when you have a fucking baby. You really need to stop, stop and try again. You've already had a little more experience than any of the others on this sub. I've even read some of the comments. I have a very similar problem with a sexist joke on this sub. I've not read any of the comments that said that it was a joke and I didn't find that interesting, but what"
99,86,Is there any other way to describe this?
86,57,The post he wrote is sexist. So thats a good point.
99,86,I think people need to get their heads up and realize that they are not just fools. The only thing that really bothers me is how you can't actually be an asshole.
86,57,"I'm gonna go through a few comments just to make sure I'm not getting the joke that's being said. I just want to make sure I'm not being rude and making a joke about my own sex life. It's a joke because I'm a woman, so I'm not sure how to get around the fact that I'm being sexist a bit."

99,86,"I find it ironic that people who aren't aware of the dangers of a vaccine are willing to wear a mask and unless it causes them problems, the joke is valid."
86,57,You're just a bit weird. I've read these post by post for a while and I've not gotten into it yet. It's just a petty joke.
99,86,"I mean the guy who says it is a joke should have thought that it would be a joke in the first place. I think it was a joke because he was being so naive about it, not a joke, and they needed some proof to push it to court."
86,57,There are a lot of jokes in this sub that just aren't funny.
99,86,"I'm a fan of humor, but have a strong feeling that I'm going to be criticized on a daily basis."
86,57,"I read the title of the post as ""Hey, I think it's important to note that while I was in the position to wear a mask, I was not wearing a mask because my wife and I don't like doing so."""
99,86,A joke or a joke.
86,57,"That's a joke, it's a joke."
99,86,"So the article states ""If you have a mask and you want to wear it, then you're a dick?...I know what I think you're a dick. "", ""'We have the ""Making a joke"""" in Texas."
86,57,"The joke is, in fact, an underlying message. It's a joke, a piece of shit that's been made public."
99,86,In the U.S. we aren't on this one!
86,57,"i'm gonna say this, the petty joke that is posted isn't actually funny."
99,86,It's a joke.
86,57,"I thought the title was kinda funny, but I think a lot of the comments are a little over the top. It seems like he is trying to sell the idea of a female as a woman, but a male as a sexist joke?"
99,86,It sounds like a joke is coming from a government that believes that a doctor has to give you a mask to protect you from a virus which is more likely to cause damage to yourself than to your health.
86,57,CANNOTANSWER.
99,86,The idea of a mask is a joke. They can't make it illegal because they believe that it will be abused.
86,57,"I've been wearing a mask in my house and I've been feeling great about myself. When it was a joke I wore it all the time to my face, not for anyone. It's been a few years since I've ever worn it and I can't even tell you how much more miserable it was than when it was a joke."
99,86,It's a joke.
86,57,"Its a joke, but they are not making it a joke."
99,86,"So, because this post is about a government official pushing a joke, he shouldn't have snubbed any people who had to wear a mask to a health event? Is there any other way to explain it?"
86,57,I've been wearing a mask all the time for a few years now. No way it was a joke.
99,86,">I've been in a situation where I do not understand the meaning of a ""petty joke"" is."
86,57,It is an interesting point. This is about the politics of the US.
99,86,"I don't know, but I have a friend who wears masks to work every day at the office. He's not allowed to wear one on the job. And so he's just never gotten a chance to get a test he needs, or get one without a mask."
86,57,"I know the topic, and it sucks to hear that he is trying to push for this kind of nonsense. He was trying to show people he is being a bit, but he's not being sexist. You are not wrong. People who think this is a joke will be happy with themselves but they won't be happy with being sexist if they don't get to hear it or get to know the joke."
99,86,"The first thing I should do is explain it better to the other poster. I like how you put it - the article itself is just a joke that has to be thrown at the side of the public, and I think you're just talking to a joke on the internet. I think the article is misleading. But the title is misleading. But the article is about the government. Vaccination is a legitimate medical necessity. But it is also part of the measures deployed by the CDC to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
86,57,"You know, the people who think this is a joke (they know he's trying to sell the idea of a sexist joke, because they're all women) probably have a different story."
99,86,Vaccination is not a law. Vaccination is not a law. This is a law.
86,57,"What a man! I wish we had that guy wearing the same mask all the time, he was so cute, and the whole ""I don't know what I'd wear"" thing was an incredible thing to be the same size as me."
99,86,It's a joke. It's not an excuse. It's an excuse.
86,57,CANNOTANSWER.
99,86,"Vaccination is a legitimate medical necessity, but it isn't a law."
86,57,"This is the right question. You just told me that you think wearing a mask for a few days is a joke, but it's not a joke."
99,86,"""Making a joke"" is part of the measures deployed by the CDC to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
86,57,"As long as it's a joke, it's the right joke."
99,86,"[In Texas, wearing a mask is a legal requirement for most of the states whose health care system is covered in the act of vaccination is a legal requirement for the government to have it implemented and enforced on the entire population. The government is the primary source of public health ebola. Vaccination is a legitimate medical necessity in most states if you're not willing to do it.''"
