14,6,They are invading the US and should just put it in the hands of people who need it.
25,6,"i mean, there are so many things that make a person look like a ghost, but i guess that s more of a safety precaution than a real threat"
36,6,My favorite thing to do when i see people not wearing a mask is cough as hard as i can right in front of them because the fear in their eyes is always so rewarding
37,6,The US president made it look like there was a state that had it and he was taking steps to cut the budget.
41,6,"The apocalypse, not the anti-spray movement."
48,6,That mask is what will keep us from having an issue. Is it as serious as this one? Then he can be a government member?
54,6,"This is why Obama has no face at all : wearing a mask, and a public health order is just a ridiculous dick move."
64,6,As much as I dislike the mask laws they are not the only ones that do it.
66,6,"They would not give you the opportunity to put on the mask. Regardless, wearing it properly would be against the law. It will stop the spread of a virus."
68,6,I can only assume that is not the context of the movie...
77,6,"They did not vote against the mask public health order. And, I can't believe they voted against the mask public health order."
89,6,"The last time I've ever worn my mask I went to work the next day, and one of my coworkers came over and told me I would not wear it for the next month."
92,6,"That's pretty much what I was going to say, too."
93,6,The most terrifying thing to happen to a politician is he would have to go on the 'fuck with me' bus and start wearing his mask and getting his face tattooed on it.
96,6,"When a game comes to town and the team has a full head mask and helmets, I don't believe there is an official or a player who wears a mask."
98,6,The government is not in a position to stop the spread of a virus
9,6,The government is currently putting out a mask on all public use to prevent a possible virus outbreak.
10,6,I just learned that it does not seem like a necessary part of the 'gov't mandates.
14,6,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
25,6,This makes me think about the President. I'm going to go with him as to why he must wear a mask. That's crazy!
36,6,The best part about the article is that the people in your post are not talking about a mask and that's one of the reasons.
37,6,"OP, I am very sorry but I want to clarify: There is not a statewide mask mandate. This was made to prevent the spread of the virus in the United States."
41,6,"Well, it's a whole different thing for them, because you don't want them to wear a mask."
48,6,"He can be a government member, but the only time the tv shows he goes to in Georgia is if the president tells him he should wear a mask."
54,6,"My husband is wearing a mask at work. Besides, we know they have a ton of stuff to cover the neck when he leaves work, and he's not trying to protect us. He's wearing a mask to keep the air out while he's in the car, which is part of the reason he doesn't wear a mask, so he does."
64,6,"The public health laws are very, very similar to the public health law. It's really a very simple matter, but they are one of the most important pieces of government legislation. They should be able to have it at the local and national level."
66,6,"The issue is that there is no evidence that wearing a mask causes a viral infection. It's not a virus, it's a mask."
68,6,">I can only assume that is not the context of the movie... I don't see that as saying anything to people on your team, even if that means they're on the team. I think they're being serious, but this is something they are not really responsible for."
77,6,...and one did not vote due to affiliation to a school.
89,6,"This topic should be brought up at any one time or another, right?"
92,6,> So why does the EPA not want people fired because they are supposed to wear a mask?
93,6,Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of a virus.
96,6,"... and the implication is that you should try to put on a mask, or you should get a fucking mask, or a gtfo mask."
98,6,"If it's the US's responsibility to cut a man off and kill the man, I think the he doesn't need to wear a mask."
9,6,"Well it's the public health order, i have to say."
10,6,I like the part about the government in removing a mask. If you are sick and they haven't given you the information you need to protect yourself then maybe you should be better off not wearing the mask.
14,6,"I don't know what you're talking about. I don't know if you are being sarcastic or not. That's just a silly question that's going to come up pretty frequently. If it were me I'd be interested in having you and my friends come out to my office to see what they've been wearing. I've seen people in my office work on a day to day basis, and I think they're interested in helping to make sure they're protected by their government mandates."
25,6,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
36,6,"This is the gist of my post. A mask is not the only thing that may not be on the headline. It is the gist of things that will be on the headline: ""Your father could not 'have' the virus but that it isn't an emergency,"" which is why he should have said that it was a good idea to wear a mask."
37,6,It's probably a valid point to have a mask and not get a mask from the federal government.
41,6,The apocalypse and the anti-spray movement are the ones I've encountered in a lot of my work.
48,6,"I'm not a lawyer, but it seems to me that there are policies against people wearing a mask to help prevent spreading of a virus. The president tripped and is trying to change their policy."
54,6,"Wearing a mask doesn't stop the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask does, however, stop the spread of the virus."
64,6,"This is a bit of a stretch, but my own opinion: ""I think it's the government's petty policy to be an asshole because I don't think it's a good idea to put a mask on when you're sick. You're not going to have to pay to have a private health insurance because people have it on."""
66,6,I am not a fan of the idea of a mask in this context.
68,6,"The sexism issue really arose when it was mentioned in the movie, and as you have pointed out, it was made by a black man, so in that case, the government is in a position to stop the spread of a virus, but you're right that the guy does not know the reason for the mask issue, but is saying it's funny."
77,6,"I was the person to mention this here (you're right, that does not help, it's useless and I hate it. Oh, fuck that."
89,6,"> If you don't know anyone that would want to be in a hospital in a medical emergency, you should be able to say ""I don't wear a mask to help spread the virus. If you don't, that's a medical emergency. If you don't want to wear a mask, do not wear it."
92,6,"'I don't want people fired because they are supposed to wear a mask'. If they want to be fired, then they can't because they have to pay a fine."
93,6,Those that wear the masks can be as scared of the virus as a woman can be. That's the reason why women don't get vaccines.
96,6,"I'm not sure you really believe it or have you read the article. But it seems like a big fucking shithole to me that the gov't's mandates to protect people from the spread of a virus are just so ridiculous, I can't even get away from the fact that it's so ridiculous."
98,6,/r/relationships/u/raisedbysmart
9,6,"It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.You wear a mask? I wore one last year but nobody liked it at all. I don't understand why anyone would wear one when you're in a hurry to get into that kind of situation. The government is already having a serious attack on this country, and he is absolutely fucked over by it. He was going to have to revert to the mask ordinance to help people. He could've been better off with a mask."
10,6,I know the thing is the whole idea of the government is so simple that they've decided to give them more power and I've been a little more skeptical about it than it's been.
14,6,"People wear their masks to protect themselves from germs, and are protected by government mandates. That's a great way to avoid being sarcastic about a guy who was making a joke, but the person you were asking to get a visa for doesn't actually understand what you're saying."
25,6,"You're correct in the idea that the government's role as health care workers is to prevent and control the spread of HIV, that's wrong."
36,6,"Well, that's true. The guy who told me it was an emergency to have a mask was the fbi. If you are a fan of the government, they are making a big money by selling vaccines to help people get the vaccine, and if you have a problem with a virus, then you should be able to take it off when you go to the CDC and they will help."
37,6,"He's getting a mask to go with his diet. He's just not going to make it out of school, and I don't think any of his health concerns matter in the matter. Besides, the whole thing isn't about the federal government's own responsibility. I don't think people understand this as a political issue, I think it's more a generalization than a generalization."
41,6,I think this is the one of the only times I know that the federal government can't have the proper legal protections.
48,6,"IANAL, but the president has said that his plan to prevent the spread of this virus is unacceptable. It's possible he is being politically skewed, but that is just not true."
54,6,"Unless they want to use it, they can't."
64,6,"I'm in Georgia. I'm reading a lot of conservative articles. I've read an article from a guy who wrote about putting on a mask outside of a school, I can confirm that the school is the only one in the state that is willing to pay a fee for a mask. I also believe that the state has a statute of limitations for this type of behavior, so this is a very relevant article."
66,6,"There's a lot of misconceptions of 'I don't want to dick it', but that isn't my point."
68,6,"... I would love to see this. I wouldn't go for it, but the title fucks up."
77,6,"> It's also a joke. If you're trying to figure out how to do it correctly, that isn't the place to be."
89,6,It's pretty obvious that a mask can help prevent some kind of sickness but it's a good idea to use it at all times.
92,6,"A twilight story about a crowbar, or the idea of a mask, in the article is actually not so far removed from the article. It's very likely that that's the case."
93,6,"I'm from Texas. I can say I feel like a real socialist at heart, and I feel like a sexist one, because that's the type of person who would have to go to the democrats to get vaccines, and even the ones who won't. I think I'm a realist."
96,6,"If you don't want to go to games, you are obligated to go."
98,6,I can say i've seen a lot of stuff i can do when I've been there. I don't think I can figure out what it is about this. What i can do is to keep my mouth shut. If I had a brain tumor I would drool like my nose and scream and cry. I'm sick of hearing a raccoon's scream and cry. Then I drool and cry every time my mother was in a hospital or something. And then after I dread the
9,6,"The government can get out of there with the ACA. It doesn't need to help with what it does, but it can help in some ways."
10,6,"The school that you are discussing is in the middle of a national campaign campaign that is aimed at putting in a ""true"" message - and it's an indictment of the government."
14,6,I don't think the government is gonna have a choice about where the kids are going to get sick...
25,6,">Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I think this is a valid question, but I think the fact that the player isn't wearing a mask is what you're getting at, which isn't so stupid."
36,6,"You have not had the opportunity to meet the president, you have not been elected, but you are the president."
37,6,"People can say the word ""fun"" in a very strange way but it's not true."
41,6,> I think this is the one of the only times I know that the federal government can't have the proper legal protections.
48,6,This is exactly what we're talking about.
54,6,>the thing about wearing a mask is... you wear it and you eat pizza and you're not healthy?
64,6,"This was a very good article. It's very insightful. This is not just the EPA's problem, but they are using the term ""fake"" to make people think it's a good idea."
66,6,You are not a Republican. Are you a republican?
68,6,i'm gonna take it.
77,6,"They're not just complaining. The government does it to keep the school from being too close to the people, the government actually isn't so bad at it."
89,6,A new CDC study indicates that the use of masks is the main cause of sickness. It is not common to wear a mask in public. A person who hasn't been exposed to a virus can get HIV/AIDS.
92,6,I want to start reading what you have written so I can give an example. I'm a very civil and kind person and I don't want to be an asshole.
93,6,People who say that they think that you should wear masks in public aren't really going to be able to have an intelligent decision on an issue.
96,6,"I know you're thinking of people who think the gov't's mandates are ridiculous, but they don't actually say something to stop it from spreading, which they do in a lot of states. I'm not sure what you mean. If you want to reassure me that your team isn't willing to do the right thing, the gov't has the right to tell you that you don't want to go."
98,6,What a joke! We gotta fuck a lot of stupid things like this.
9,6,The government has been doing this since 2003. Hopefully he's a dick.
10,6,I'm a Republican. I think you are going to be an idiot if you want to hear this - or at least make that claim that it is actually false. I've been in a similar situation and I've seen the EPA on a school board. Is there anything I can do to prevent that?
14,6,The Obama presidency has not been voted into office. It's the president's role to decide when to stop his own govt. This is what the White House is trying to get over. It's about how the president's policies and policies do not contribute anything to the government.
25,6,You're an asshole.
36,6,It's not a bad thing for a lot of people to be told to get a hat for health reasons. I read the article.
37,6,"Using the word ""fun"" isn't a political issue, it's a personal one. It's not even a ""fun"" movie. This is a ""fun"" film."
41,6,I don't know much about the government and what it supposedly does. It seems like they do not want people to know or it's not a law.
48,6,"I'm in high school and I have never heard a thing like ""What's on tv when the virus hits me?"". That's an untrue, untrue, and unprovoked comment that comes from a friend who works for the FBI. They think they can help. I think I can see how the government does this."
54,6,"The movie ""The U.S. Government"" (http://www.noaaac.gov/wiki/RapCrypt.jpg): The ""U.S. Government"" is trying to tell you to stop wearing a mask, or not. The thing about wearing a mask is... you wear it and you eat pizza and you're not healthy? ""...I think the guy is an incompetent idiot who can eat a sandwich for his meal. He is also a degenerate who can eat pizza. I love that it"
64,6,"EPA has a new study showing that when people are asked to wear a mask outside or in your car alone is a really dangerous thing. And I think you're right, there are some people out there that don't have a sense of humor. But, the government is not willing to admit that their behavior is wrong or a good thing. But, the government isn't being a good thing. There is a huge difference in the fact that people think they need to wear a mask in order to stop it."
66,6,"The US has no medical insurance, which is not necessary. In the US, insurance is not a security system. They have no protection. It is the only thing the EPA wants to change. It's not like there are any laws about vaccines in place for that purpose."
68,6,"I agree that the film is extremely confusing. It's not like there aren't any jokes about it, but it's also not a hysterical premise. The movie is a good read. I think the ""Making a mask to protect a black player"" is a really good example."
77,6,OP: OP: I am a teacher who has to wear a mask at school for the purpose of protecting people.
89,6,"CANNOTANSWER](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/relationships-doctor-the-huffington-post-trump-shelby-the-huffingtonpost) was the first one to get upvoted for stating that I'm a good Democrat who wears a mask in public, but the government has no problem using it at work because it's sick."
92,6,"I don't know what to say here but I think it's an interesting question. Are you sure they know? Are you just telling me they're not using the term ""fake"" as a security tool?"
93,6,You're telling me what the joke is.
96,6,Why would the CDC want the medical field to have a helmet at all?
98,6,Why would someone do this if they knew they had a twitch account? It's a joke.
9,6,"I am in the US, and the government doesn't even seem to care what other people think about it."
10,6,"I know a lot of people who want to wear a mask, but I'm more into politics, not science. I've never even heard a single instance where the federal government is forcing it on a school board."
14,6,"The president of the United States needs to look at this, and look into a more sophisticated solution that might be available to the public."
25,6,>The problem is that the EPA is sued for allowing people without the mask
36,6,"I think people who feel scared because of something like TWitchcon are sick. They're really sick and are being attacked. If you're not immune to this, you're probably fucked. You're an idiot."
37,6,"I know it's very complicated, but there's a lot of overlap. You can't have a whole movie about an entire school in one year."
41,6,"I don't think it is ""unjust"" to have the government say ""it's only the government that wants to do the work for you"" if it's not a skunk mask."
48,6,"I'm sure that one of the reasons you have to wear a mask is because of the stigma of being a government member, and that the CDC is trying to change the policy. This isn't a joke."
54,6,scummy as fuck. I've always thought the problem is the govt not treating the public as equals to the private sector.
64,6,This is a really real issue that needs to be investigated.
66,6,"I like the fact that I was so upset with the government's anti-vaccine stance that I resisted even calling it a joke because I said something similar and then the CDC said I'm not sure if I'd ever get sick or have a virus in my mouth again, because I'm afraid it's not something I want to do right now. I think the problem with the EPA's approach to preventing a virus is the fact that the government has to spend money on it."
68,6,"CANNOTANSWER: Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.And then, on top of that, the sexism issue, he was wearing the mask because he had a gun, then the helmet got smashed, so he'd have to wear a hoodie. Is this true?"
77,6,"Apparently this mask is banned, it's a joke."
89,6,i'm a liberal in the U.S. and i've always been a big part of the healthcare industry.
92,6,It's not a bad idea.
93,6,"""The President of the United States is wearing a mask to prevent the spread of a virus""(https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican_Mask_Summit) So you're saying that if you're a republican and the government has to stop it, it's a nutjob joke? Because I'm not a republican. And I'm not an anti-virus nutjob."
96,6,"As a medical field employee, I know that some people are not going to take advantage of this, and there are some who do not have access to the basic protections."
98,6,"It's a bit of a joke, but it's an excellent way to show that the guy is in this shit. He's not wearing a mask or anything. You know, if you like a person who's not a fan of a person's politics or morals then they aren't going to want to be a part of the problem."
9,6,"I was at a health centre, and one of the parents told me that people can wear masks and have a lot of fun, because that is what I'm not familiar with, so I just wear a mask."

14,6,"""I'm not sure how anyone is able to sabotage any kind of health insurance or prevent people from getting the virus."" (http://www.acnn.org/article/distance-of-virus-senior-virus-senior-virus) I'm not sure how anyone is able to sabotage any kind of health insurance or prevent people from getting the virus, unless you have a valid health care policy in place, and if you do this, then you are not a shit job?"
25,6,"...as a black student in Florida, I can relate to the phrase, The President Wearing a Mask. [Was the mask part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."

68,6,"This is an important thing for all of us. You cannot ""make a mask to protect a black player"" without a mask to prevent the spread of the virus. Vaccination is not required. It's not needed for everyone unless the person is in an advanced stage of a clinical trial. It is a good movie, but it's not funny."
77,6,"I think you're on to something. The idea of a mask isn't to stop people from spreading a virus. What they are proposing is for a school to have a'separate'school that does not allow anyone to be inside and outside, thus potentially causing people to be unwell."
89,6,"if you're a doctor, you have to wear a mask."
92,6,"No, it's not a good idea. It's a horrible idea. It's not a good idea, and it's not a good idea. The idea is that people should be fired and the public should not feel intimidated and be forced to put themselves through that."
93,6,"There was a movie called ""Six Questions About President Obama: How are our policies different for each party?"" in which a Republican candidate said ""We should make sure people are wearing them because the other guy isn't wearing them"". This one wasn't funny, just a joke."
96,6,I'm not sure why you're getting downvoted. The government is the main source of this nonsense.
98,6,"i agree with you there, this is a joke and this is what i want to see"
9,6,I'm also curious to know what the law is about.
10,6,I can't believe that a snarky comment would make me think of a troll. I've been bitten by a large prick before.
14,6,I'd be glad to put the mask on in case you have a medical issue.
25,6,"Yes, it's a joke. I'm a liberal and wear a mask, and the joke isn't that funny, it's that if you don't know what a mask is, then you might not be able to afford it, and you'll be worse off with a vaccinated person."
36,6,"I read it and thought, ""Hey man, I'm gonna have to go get some of these.

48,6,This is the newest post on this subreddit. There is so much more going on.
54,6,I think you're thinking of how people can get a virus to spread while in the car.
64,6,"I have heard that the government has a problem with the public health law, which was passed in 2014 by the EPA, and the CDC has been able to make it worse for people because of it. It seems the government is having some problems with the government, and there's not enough people who support their agenda."

10,6,"It's not a joke, but it is a joke. That's a joke. And the rest is simply not relevant."
14,6,As a fellow journalist I'm not so sure that I would want to have to be in an office where I've seen so many jokes. It's so absurd that I find it odd that you're saying a joke in order to get people to say a joke is a joke.
25,6,"So, to make sure I didn't read the headline, I was told, ""This isn't a joke, of course. It’s funny because it makes you feel uncomfortable or insecure. The articles were written by racist groups and that’s why this meme is a joke."
36,6,"There are plenty of problems with the ACA, including the fact that it's the first step to repealing it, as well as the fact that they're not actually a problem."
37,6,I have a few questions for you:
41,6,This is not the first time this has been discussed in a heated and controversial manner.
48,6,CANNOTANSWER:
54,6,"'The Government is trying to get people to wear a mask because they are sick. It is not the government trying to make them wear a mask', 'The fact that a public politician is in no position to wear a mask in public, he can't be contagious. Because if the public does not like it, it's not contagious."
64,6,The EPA is making money.
66,6,Is that the AMA of an ex-NRA member? It was a joke.
68,6,"""... but they are being ridiculous, and people are getting really upset."""
77,6,The reason the mask is banned is that it's not meant to prevent people from getting sick. A mask is meant to prevent people from being sick because they have an infection.
89,6,"I don't think any of the comments are sarcastic, it's an interesting thought."
92,6,>I’m against Vacks mandates cuz they ruin the economy get people fired and people should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force.
93,6,"""I have seen a movie where a nutjob joke is based on real people, which is what this sub is referring to."
96,6,"You're being serious, but I've been able to put it in context and explain it a little. I think that's how a team needs to make sure that there's something to do. Vaccination is a crime, but it's a moral issue."
98,6,"I'm not the one that makes this joke, it's not a joke."
9,6,You're a huge dick.
10,6,"I don't know about you but I can say that if I have to decide what to do, I am going to make this."
14,6,"The joke, while hilarious, is that people don't have an agenda."
25,6,"The article said that 'We are responsible for the spread of HIV, and we don't require us to wear a mask in situations like this. ',"
36,6,It's not going to work because you're afraid of someone else. The vaccine is going to be a bad idea if you're not a fan of the government.
37,6,"If this movie is in a film and a joke, and they're trying to make fun of the government, it's probably a joke."
41,6,The article is misleading. The article does not mention the EPA and NRA have no authority to change the healthcare system. A mask can save lives. The government is attempting to block the spread of viruses.
48,6,This is an interesting topic. There is a lot going on.
54,6,"I would think that the joke - and the AMA, i. e. the question of whether people like skunks and that ""You don't want to get stomped on"" are all a lot of people that are not a part of it."
64,6,"...and that's why it's called a joke, not a joke."
66,6,The AMA was about how people think the idea of a mask is a joke.
68,6,"""I agree with the other points here and it's important to note that the people involved in the AMA are going to be able to understand what the AMA is about."
77,6,“We have a mask preventing people from getting sick.”
89,6,"Vaccination is a serious health issue, and isn't a serious health issue."
92,6,It’s actually a joke:
93,6,I would be a nutjob if I could rephrase that nutjob joke. I'd like the movie a lot better.
96,6,"As a nfl player, I have a lot of respect for my teammates, and I want to thank them for their leadership. I know their respect is very high, but their ability to stand up for their team and do their job in an environment where they can do their jobs, and their team values them. I have been on an NFC team since 1983 and our team had been one of the best in the league. I would be honored to bring back our masks because I did not understand why they have so many players that aren't a problem."
98,6,"I do not like the idea of wearing a mask, but I do not believe this is a joke."
9,6,">I'm sorry to say, this is my experience with this, but in this case, it's just a joke that doesn't really exist because you've said you do, and you don't understand the whole thing."""
10,6,I have read that the government is not trying to give them more power. The EPA requires a splash of smoke when people are sick. It's a joke because it's about the EPA.
14,6,>Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
25,6,"I'm not sure what you mean by ""I don't care for the joke. I think it's funny because it makes you feel uncomfortable or insecure."""
36,6,I love these words. What you said is what I am going to say when I talk about my opinion on the topic. I do not like the jokes. I can't believe that one of them isn't true.
37,6,"I don't think it's a joke, a joke and a joke. I think it's the joke, the prank. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke."
41,6,he is trying to get the government to pay to stop sabotage the health care system.
48,6,It's just an excuse to not support the virus because it's dangerous. I don't have a good answer. I don't think I'm a lawyer.
54,6,You're a joke. There's no way to make a joke. I'm a joke. And that's a joke. The whole point of the ACA is to protect the public and help prevent the spread of a disease. It isn't a joke.
64,6,“I think it’s a joke because people believe the government is a big business and they don’t want to see it.”
66,6,"It’s a hysterical joke. It doesn’t mean anyone wants to wear a mask or get a vaccine, it means nothing."
68,6,CANNOTANSWER:
77,6,"It’s not really a joke. It is a joke. The CDC was created by a woman in the 1940s. It’s not a joke, it’s a joke."
89,6,"[...As a former Republican, I can assure you, I'm not trying to make a joke. I think it’s the one of the sexist jokes that I think is very funny. I think that the phrase ""I think it’s a joke. I think we need to talk to our doctors about the consequences of being in the wrong for the right to be in the wrong for the right to be in the right because we don’t want to be a nutjob"". I think that’s the right thing to do."
92,6,"This is a joke, you are being sarcastic and you are not making a good point."
93,6,I am not an anti-virus nutjob.
96,6,"No, the NFL does not have the authority to make mandatory mandatory mandatory helmets."
98,6,"As one of the people who have recently gotten into his post, I have to say, this is a good joke. It is just the right way to put it."
9,6,I would wear a mask. Because that would be more fun than a normal helmet would.
10,6,"A lot of the comments here are very clearly in the context of ""a lot of the issue,"" which is why he was making the ""judgement"" part and not the joke."
14,6,"It's the 'Making a mask' part, not the joke."
25,6,I'd say it's more a joke because the person that wears it isn't a jerk or a good person. I'm a conservative so I know what's gonna happen.
36,6,"The ACA is being repealed. People are being abused, and the CDC and the CDC are making money off of it. They should give people that information on how to avoid the threat."
37,6,"You have a right to feel good about yourself. The government is a bad idea, but you can't get any more of it from people you don't know about."
41,6,... and a lot of the comments are simply about the way the CDC should manage a skunk movie.
48,6,"It's a prank, but it's also a joke."
54,6,“Wearing a mask in my car alone”
64,6,I don't think a joke is a joke either. Whether or not it is a joke is a pretty tough one.
66,6,"I would say the thing is, you are a sexist."
68,6,They don't have the authority to make mandatory mandatory helmets. So they are making it a joke.
77,6,"It's not really a joke, it's a joke."
89,6,"Vaccines are not a serious health issue, and isn't a serious health issue."
92,6,The EPA is trying to cut the liability of its employees.
93,6,It's also not a joke about how much people love a nutjob but more about how important that nutjob is to a person and the people in the U.S.
96,6,"""Most of these people are probably going to get sick because they don't have a right to wear a helmet. I'm sure the CDC has some issues with the CDC. And if I were you, I'd probably be in jail."""

10,6,A lot of comments aren't relevant to the issue.
14,6,CANNOTANSWER: Vaccination is a joke and they're trying to stop the spread of a virus.
25,6,What's the joke about? That the EPA is trying to get the CDC to do anything?
36,6,"The whole hat joke thing is just a joke. The joke has been around for several months now, so you know what I mean. I think the joke is a very good one. The one that I find funny is how it's a lot less interesting than the hat joke."
37,6,"A lot of the issues in this article relate to how the president lied about his statewide mask mandate. Unless he lied to congress, he's not going to have a chance to change his mind. There's a big difference between ""as much as it could harm you as a child"" and ""a joke."""
41,6,They can't have their authority to change the health care system.
48,6,">The first part of the sentence makes a bunch of assumptions, including how to use the word ""true"" if the EPA doesn't know how to use it."
54,6,The president is trying to make people think that the ACA was a joke. The CDC and the Obamacare administration are all in on this.
64,6,"There isn't a lot of good stuff out there, but I would be pretty concerned that there are enough people that support the EPA to stop the spread of a deadly virus."
66,6,I just want to make it clear that I'm not against the ACA. It's an idea.
68,6,"In the US, you don't wear a mask unless you get vaccines. The problem is that the people getting vaccines are using the hats as a weapon, and not to get vaccines. They don't need the masks, they need the helmets. They need the masks. I'm not saying this is a joke."
77,6,"You're being silly, but you need to see how this isn't a joke."
89,6,"No one has been getting HIV/AIDS, but they're preventing it."
92,6,"I was really confused as to how he was referring to the EPA mask and not the Vacks mandates. What does he mean by the ""fake""?"
93,6,What are the jokes? It's a joke that's about the government and not about 'The president'.
96,6,I'm going to make this a political topic. I'd rather read about some shady and ignorant players getting vaccinated than tell them that it's not a criminal thing.
98,6,"""We've gotta fuck a lot of stupid things like this."

And there are no laws that say the person must be able to wear a mask if they haven't been covered by a prank. I'm not gonna go with the guy and say he has no idea what a prank is, but if he had any problems, I would tell him the joke was a joke."
36,6,The CDC is suing the CDC for putting a hat on the road.
37,6,"""A medical professional would eat a lot of people's heads."" It's not a joke. It's a joke. The ACA is a joke because it's an insurance policy. It helps to stop the spread of a virus."
41,6,Yes. It is. It can save lives. The government is trying to block the spread of viruses.
48,6,"""The best thing is to go to the CDC for consultation, not just the President."", ""I am not even familiar with the NRA but I don't really care about the topic."

64,6,"I'm a non-native, and a lot of people I know aren't a fan of the government, and I don't know how they make money. I think it's a joke that I'm a fan of."
66,6,"That's basically the exact point in the article. You say you're against the idea of the ACA, not the actual issue."
68,6,No one is going to have a chance to be a part of the team that's been abused. It is also the best thing to do in the NFL to prevent viral infections from spread. The whole thing isn't about the actual issues - it's about how the government is working on it. The whole thing isn't about the actual issues - it's about how the government is working on it.
