101,58,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
58,52,I mean if you like the people wearing a mask and the government sucks out on it you should be fine. Just like the people who wear the earplugs.
59,58,I think the first part is too bad it is also part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
61,58,"Yeah, the truth is that a guy with boosters has the vaccine he needs to wear a mask with the vaccinated person in it - even though he isn't fully vaccinated - and I think a mask is worthless"
73,58,yea i d hate to hear this i had to go in to go buy a mask
78,58,This makes me wonder how many people in the United States wear masks at work.
91,58,"What is this mask in, the shit?"
94,58,The woman wearing the mask to protect herself is also part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
97,58,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.oh man you should come to georgia it s like people here think wearing a mask gives them covid there s so few oh man you should come to georgia it s like people here think wearing a mask gives them covid there s so few oh man you should come to georgia it s like people here think wearing a mask gives them covid there s so few oh man you should come
101,58,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
58,52,"I am a big fan of the masks, and my boss doesn't even like them."
59,58,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
61,58,"If they are required to wear a mask, why can't they just remove it? I'm just saying it is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
73,58,... and you don't even have to wear a mask.
78,58,"The other one is based off a joke. OP, I wonder how many people in the United States wear masks at work?"
91,58,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I don't think you can get an AMA or a TAX in public. Just go back in time and read the titties and the rest of the comments.
94,58,You know what he does: He puts himself down to fuck. That's just a cover up for him to be. He says he's not going to be able to stop the spread of a virus. But it's not going to be able to stop the spread of the virus. It's going to be his job.
97,58,"That s not how crazy trump made the United States of America It's a good thing he's taken out his mask in this time period Ooh man i like na the best, i want to see the sleaze on it!"
101,58,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
58,52,It's really hard for people to say that they can't have the disease.
59,58,The idea of the mask is a lot more common in schools than it is in health insurance. The problem is that you are doing it to prevent people from getting sick in a controlled environment.
61,58,"This is basically the same thing that happens to everyone in the US. The masks are good, they prevent the spread of viruses. But you could never have any kind of control over them. You could even wear a mask. The problem is that the federal government doesn't have the ability to have an official that isn't involved with the problem. The problem is that there is no right or wrong way for them to say what they want."
73,58,"Is this how you are talking about ""a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I don't have an email saying this is wrong. He was being totally mean to everyone else. He's using the phrase ""fuck I don't want to feel this way"" too much."
78,58,I don't see a single point in trying to stop the spread of the virus in the United States.
91,58,"This is the shit that the commenters are trying to make about the US government's mandate to help stop a virus that's already been spreading. They are saying that wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus, so they're saying that wearing a mask would be a huge fuck up if the helmet was only worn for one or two months and not the rest of the squad, because shittiness would be hard."
94,58,I like the idea of wearing a mask when I'm out and about and that is the main thing that prevents me from being there. I am sure you know how to do that and I'm not even a fan of the mask.
97,58,I love you. You're really brave and that's a very funny quote.
101,58,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
58,52,What you said is what they said.
59,58,The one in the link is all of that info.
61,58,"I'm an affluent person who lives in the US and the first thing I know about the TWitchcon is that I don't have a license to do so, but I do know that you don't know much about the TWitchcon."
73,58,"""This is a serious fuck up if it's a joke."
78,58,"I'd probably want to wear a mask in the car to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS in my state. But a helmet is actually a skewed way of saying something like, ""You're a terrible person. The idea that people need to wear a mask is a joke."""
91,58,"What's the point of that shit? That's stupid. The issue is that in the US, a mask is no longer the most effective protection against a virus."
94,58,"This man is lying, he is not a doctor, he is a prick. That's why I'm so sad. I was just wondering if this could actually be done to stop a spread of a virus, and I couldn't help but think about this for a moment. YMMV, I don't really care what the question is. People are supposed to think that these masks stop the spread of any type of illness and stop the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in"
97,58,>I love you. You're really brave and that's a very funny quote.
101,58,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
58,52,"If you are wearing a mask and don't wear it, you are still going to get sick and sick, you can't stop your virus. I've heard trump says the same thing about wearing a mask and that you can do something about it. Basically they're just trying to stop the spread of a virus."
59,58,This is the best way to handle this problem.
61,58,"That's one thing. It's also another thing, in a different light, to say, that the government is trying to create a new era of ""adoption""."
73,58,>They're just a tool to fight with someone else.
78,58,My friend's father also wore a mask on his birthday. The one-handed policy is to get him to wear it at work.
91,58,I think the point of the article is that they are trying to say something about the US government's mandate to help stop a virus that's already been spreading. They are saying that wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the US government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. There is no way for the government to allow a more uniform on their body.
94,58,It's not a joke. The joke is it can be done.
97,58,I think wearing a mask is a good idea to prevent someone from becoming a virus.
101,58,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
58,52,They're trying to stop this. I don't want this to happen again.
59,58,"It's ridiculous that you're being a narcissist. I don't want to be the only one trying to do it. But it's really not a big red flag. This is what he's trying to say, and I think it's hilarious how he is trying to explain it in a joking manner. [[https://www.nyc.gov/mapping/cd/cd/mapping_twitchcon_definition.aspx)"
61,58,"It's a problem, not a problem at all."
73,58,What the fuck? They rebrand it as a tool to fight.
78,58,So the government was telling the people to go to work and buy the masks?
91,58,The article goes on to state that there's no way to prevent the spread of viruses and the government must actually be able to change them. The article goes on to say that there's nothing in the article that says that a mask is no longer the most effective protection against viruses.
94,58,Wearing a mask is one of the most effective means to stop the spread of a virus.
97,58,"He made the move to Georgia, which is a small town, and has a secluded strip with a tiny park. He's not allowed to go outside, if you ask me. He's allowed to sit on the sidewalk with the rest of his friends. He can't be scared of him."
101,58,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
58,52,I think the point of the article is that they are trying to say something about the US government's mandate to help stop the spread of a virus.
59,58,">I feel like the only good thing about them is that they make people uncomfortable in their room, so it becomes like the ol''fucking shit....and I've always thought this is something that’s a fucking joke."
61,58,"I'm just going to say that it's not a bad idea to wear a mask, but that it's a good idea for people to be vaccinated, a real life savage."
73,58,We have an issue with this:
78,58,"I've heard that people can wear helmets in public, but they have a different problem. That said, I don't really care. I'd love to get a helmet because there are so many of us. I don't have a mask, and I have no idea why - but I'd like to help out if someone wants to help."
91,58,"[Stop putting fda in the position of president for 10 years.](http://www.fred.gov/fda/) What's the point of the film? I would be very, very surprised to see that that's the case. The government was critical of them when it was in power."
94,58,"You know, the way I'm writing this is going to make my face look as if I was in the face of some sort of death threat."
97,58,You should read his wiki post.
101,58,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
58,52,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I think wearing a mask is a good idea to prevent someone from becoming a virus.
59,58,The ACA has the potential to be a big deal for sure.
61,58,""" Having a mask is a bad idea to me. Rather than preventing the spread of viruses, it is a good idea to protect people from them.... because of the CDC and their inability to do it effectively,"""
73,58,"I think that OP will be offended to learn how many people don't like the joke. The entire ""doctor and docs"" section in the sub is hilarious. The other posts are hilarious as well. And this post is a great one."
78,58,"They're really sarcastic. I'm sure that the ACA would not have gotten around to getting people to wear their helmets, and I'm really skeptical of what it might do. The ACA is what they want and they can actually get people to wear them and a vaccination is the only viable option."
91,58,"This has been posted on a few other subreddits, but you should probably look at it for context. It's a movie about the health care system and the skunks. Then you can read the source and make sure that the EPA and NRA aren't the ones getting blame."
94,58,I wore a mask once. It stopped the spread of a virus.
97,58,I'm from Georgia. I'm a big fan of the Trump administration.
101,58,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
58,52,"There's a new one out, but I'm not sure the story is true."
59,58,"The point of a mask isn't preventing any disease, it's stopping the spread of infection."
61,58,I went to a TWitchCon and there were three major disasters going on. One was really bad. And then the second was awful. They were all too far away to have the same sort of problems in the CDC. So they started doing it at the TWitchCon because the government was so evil and trying to bring attention to the CDC.
73,58,>I'm going to leave.
78,58,"CANNOTANSWER](http://www.twitchcon.org/) You are a twitch. You are being really sarcastic. I've never thought that if people had a problem with something that was ""fun"" or anything else they would not get the message. If they have a problem with something that is ""fun"" or anything else they would not get the message. If I were a twitch, I would be pretty sarcastic. I don't really understand the ACA. I don't even"
91,58,CANNOTANSWER: People in America should get the EPA to get rid of the federal government.
94,58,I'm a doctor and i don't like wearing them. I was just wondering if this could actually be done to stop the spread of a virus.
97,58,"He's not racist, he's just a douche who isn't allowed to use a mask on his face."
101,58,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
58,52,"I don't like to wear masks, but it does make me sick and sick. I get sick and sick every time I wear them. And when people get sick they don't really care and just continue to have fun."
59,58,The CDC has some serious issues involving this but it's a really interesting topic.
61,58,"So what do the other states have about having an official that isn't involved in the situation? They're essentially the same government as they are. They don't have a right to do anything that's not legally required, but their problem with the government is that the federal government isn't involved with the issue."
73,58,A hivemind. Do you mean 'initiating a big fight' with someone if you're not a doctor?
78,58,"It seems that many people haven't seen the movie or heard of any real real news or anything like that yet, and I think the joke was pretty well received. It's interesting to think that the ACA was passed and there was an effort to get people to wear a mask because they are ill. It seems that people in the US have a bad time and the people who were sick probably did not have a chance to get their vaccine. They aren't allowed to wear their masks. They are allowed to have their own on their own. It's very unusual to see this"
91,58,"CANNOTANSWER: People in America should get the EPA to get rid of the federal government. They can fire people who don't comply with the regulations and would be fired for violating them. The issue is that in the US, a mask is no longer the most effective protection against a virus."""
94,58,"Unless someone's trying to save you, this isn't about stopping a virus. You can prevent it with a mask, but they can't help. They are the only people in the world that need a mask and a helmet. They can't use it. People are supposed to do their own research, so there's not much point in making this joke."
97,58,"""Oh man, you should come to Georgia and see the sleaze on it!"""
101,58,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
58,52,"There is nothing to be ashamed of here, it's not about stopping the spread of a virus."
59,58,"It's a great movie. It has a good story and humor, but it's a great one."
61,58,Because the government is a dick.
73,58,"It sounds like the EPA wants to shut down the EPA and stop people from wearing masks. Apparently, they haven't started using this as a security tool for a while."
78,58,"I was in this same situation. There were people in my office who didn't wear masks, and there were people who were trying to buy a mask in a random way. Honestly, I didn't know how many people could get a helmet, I thought that was a joke, and my supervisor said it was illegal in the US."
91,58,That's a great piece.
94,58,That's the way I'm writing this. I can't help but think about this for a moment.
97,58,"There's a documentary film called 'Hats and Masks'. They are about a shady politician, the Obama administration. It has a huge documentary series about the people that are the shady pricks, and the evil shady people that are the evil ones."
101,58,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
58,52,"This is how the anti-viral movement works in the US. We have an anti-viral campaign against it for a number of reasons, but it's one of the main reasons. Especially in this country."
59,58,"I have been told a couple times, and the best part of the movie is that he's just trying to make it sound like something that's funny as well as funny."
61,58,"As a person who doesn't have the power to go to any of these events, I think it is a pretty crappy argument to say that a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I see people using that phrase all the time, it's kinda like you're saying 'Waving a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.'"
73,58,"It's a lot like a mask, as in the name of the hat you are wearing. Using the phrase you are using is a way to make you feel uncomfortable and uncomfortable. You just get used to the mask, not what you are doing, and there isn't anything funny to say or say. This is really a joke. The entire point of the joke is to show how sexist Obama is."
78,58,I have no idea how the people who haven't smoked in a long time were going to be able to get the vaccine without their helmet.
91,58,"I am pretty sure this movie was directed by Joey Duvall and it was published by the EPA as part of their program that is being developed and implemented by the federal government. There is a similar movie in the other sections as well, and they say ""I think it's worth looking around and see if I can help you."" (which is exactly the exact same type of thing I do in the AMA, but I've only seen that it's an attempt to highlight some of the things that this guy is trying to achieve."
94,58,"I'm a doctor and I don't wear them. I'm a doctor, and I've never been able to stop my own infected bf."
97,58,"“They don’t think he’s racist at all, so what can you say about this?”"
101,58,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
58,52,That is the definition of a joke.
59,58,"The whole idea of a mask isn’t a skunk friendly movie. The whole idea of a mask. It’s just a tool of the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. Ahh, I hate the idea of a mask. It’s just a tool of the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. 'Hey, this is what I was thinking, a mask is a tool of the government to help prevent and eradicate the spread of a virus."

59,58,The fact that you want to say something to people is a big red flag.
61,58,CANNOTANSWER. CANNOTANSWER.
73,58,[NAME] is the first person I've ever heard of a president who fucks with people. I'm going to say it:
78,58,"If the joke isn't based on a joke, then if a government was going to get them to wear them and get the vaccine, they wouldn't have passed the ACA.... and I'm sure it is a joke."
91,58,"I see that the NRA is using a mask to protect people against the spread of a virus, but not for the vaccination."
94,58,"I think that the naive idea of a ""I wear a mask when I'm out and about and that is the main thing that prevents me from being there."" is so funny, like a joke... a joke."

101,58,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
58,52,"In this context, the term 'hi hat guy' comes from the word ""weeper."" It means a person who is being sarcastic."

78,58,"I'm very confused at this point as to why all these people were joking in the past because of the ACA. The ACA, and the ACA's repeal are essentially the same thing."

97,58,I can't even stand hats.
101,58,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
58,52,The ''hi hat guy'' is a joke. That is why people want to keep it real. The guy has a huge hat and is a big hat.
59,58,I'm a student in California. My dad lives in a state where people are ill and he has never had a mask on or done a routine routine in his life. I was able to walk out a few times and it was not a big deal. I grew up in the middle of nowhere and never thought to do a routine routine. Until he left. It was the last thing on his mind.
61,58,It's a shame that this is the sort of joke that people like to be stuck in.
73,58,CANNOTANSWER:
78,58,"I'd be pretty upset if it was actually a joke, because I'm a doctor, and I'm a doctor."
91,58,"I’m just going to go with 'I’m pretty sure this article was directed by Joey Duvall and it was published by the EPA. In order to avoid the public bringing up that the US government does not have authority to change the health care system, you need a public forum for everyone to discuss the issue, which is why the AMA is necessary, but also the NRA needs to talk about the issue and give you the context for it."
94,58,Wearing a mask is actually one of the most effective means to stop the spread of a virus.
97,58,In order to be racist. You can't make a joke about that. You don't get to see a hat on your face. That's just a joke.

73,58,"They are not a joke. But they do say that ""this is a serious fuck up if it's a joke."" So, they are just trying to hide the joke. So they are trying to hide the joke."
78,58,"What are you going to say, Senator, for your opinion?"
91,58,"The NRA is trying to tame the US health care system, so they should be doing a AMA on what the government is doing. Basically it is trying to help people because they are sick and they don't care about the consequences of doing it."
94,58,Wearing a mask doesn't stop the spread of a virus. It's a joke. It's not a joke.
97,58,"That's a joke, but the hat jokes have to be over, because in the United States you have to be a person to think that the people who are in charge of making you feel bad about something and you must be a person in order to make that effort."

58,52,"I'm a doctor, and I have to say that, as a guy, wearing a mask is a joke. I'm not going to stop it."
59,58,I'm a psychosurgeon who studies the role of the brain as a factor in preventing health problems. So this is a joke in the light of it.

61,58,I’m going to say that I don’t think I could get a vaccinated person to go to a TWitchCon and wear a mask.
73,58,I think the EPA is doing a good job of getting people to get vaccinated. The CDC is putting out a series of fake news about people having trouble breathing because of the 'complimentary illness' that has spread recently.
78,58,ACA doesn't prevent the spread of AIDS. ACA is an attempt to prevent it.

97,58,"It's called a ""jay joke"". If it's any consolation it's always that guy who says ""The President is not racist"" and makes a joke."

58,52,"CANNOTANSWER [NAME] in the military is talking about a joke in the military. He wants people to come in to talk about it, and he says it's a joke and they just don't want to be funny. He's gonna need a mask to stop his virus."

61,58,I don't really understand why people think that's the way it is.
73,58,This is the first time I have ever heard of a president who fucks with people. I'm going to say it:
78,58,Then you know a lot about what they're trying to get people to wear a mask. You can wear a mask and get it.
91,58,"The article says that the NRA is suing the health care reform movement and that this is a ""problem"" and not a ""problem."""
94,58,"So, the people that are wearing the mask and the people who are not wearing them are not the only ones who wear them?"
97,58,I feel like the one that makes the most sense for us would say something similar to the one I hear most of the time in r/poetry
101,58,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
58,52,"Why do people say ""I'm wearing a mask to stop the spread of a virus""?"
59,58,In the article it says that the government isn't doing anything right by snooping on the problem with the public 'assholes' because it's not something that everyone is allowed to do. It is an effective measure of anti-vaccine in Texas. Wearing a mask isn't going to help combat the spread. They're not going to help combat the spread.
61,58,"It's the worst, the most hilarious, the best, and the worst joke I've ever seen."
73,58,You haven't heard of the joke. The article states that the EPA wants to shut down the EPA and stop people from wearing masks.
78,58,"In America, no matter where you live, people have the right to choose. It's a joke and not a joke."
91,58,CANNOTANSWER: I think the whole point of this is to make it very clear that the NRA is a terrorist organization.
94,58,I'm sure the people who wear a mask are more of the people that don't want to wear it.
97,58,I'm so tired of being joked and depressed over how the president is so clearly white.
101,58,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
58,52,I think there are plenty of other articles of this sort.
59,58,I've seen all these bogus articles. I'd take it as evidence of a joke that's been made about the use of a mask in healthcare. This guy can't even get away with being in the news and the lack of a mask is probably the biggest red flag he's had.
61,58,"The ACA would have nothing to do with them allowing people to get to go to TWitchCon without their vaccinations. That said, it is important to consider that these types of restrictions are being used as a means of preventing this from happening.

73,58,"if i were you, i'd stop writing this, just to have a chuckle"
78,58,What exactly does this joke really mean? It seems like it's a joke.

101,58,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
58,52,I was in the military and this came up during my graduation party. I asked a question. She said her favorite part of it was that her husband and I had to be seated over the bald man so that he wouldn't talk about the health of her bald pal and make an honest conversation and try not to eat his bald pal because he was really tired of getting jokes. She told me that he thought the bald man might just have been a good r/police guy. I don't know how they would go about it. I didn't think
59,58,"I know that's not a good idea, but this is a joke that isn't in fact being made. This is just a joke that is a real lie."
61,58,"A lot of the problems mentioned in the article are 'I'm an affluent person who lives in the US' and not ""cannot have any kind of control over them. I don't think they can do it effectively'."
73,58,What's a joke?
78,58,Yes. The ACA was passed as a joke.
91,58,"""We are suing the US government to help stop the spread of a virus. The only way to make it work is to say I'm against the virus. But that I am not going to put up with the fact that the NRA hasn't made a good decision to sabotage the health care system."""
94,58,So there isn't a problem with this as much as there is with people who have been in the military.

101,58,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
58,52,The first three parts have to be :
59,58,"I was going to ask why the state should be required to wear a mask in order to combat the spread of a virus. But it says that if you put it on, the public will be sick of it."
61,58,"The issue is that the CDC is not required to give birth at home and prevent them from having access to a healthy, HIV positive population. That's why they are doing it at TWitchcon."
73,58,I have a favorite story that's been on Netflix for a while.

91,58,"It's a good idea to get the EPA and NRA to work together to find a resolution to a health care issue so that they can not incompetently impose the medical regulations that they use to combat HIV/AIDS, such as smoking, to prevent the spread of a serious disease."

73,58,">I think that the Obama administration is a horrible person. What is the joke? Because ""the hat joke is about the guy who can't see, and is afraid of being raped."""
78,58,The ACA is just a joke. It's a joke.
91,58,"The NRA is trying to tame the US health care system. It's not a problem, it's a problem. The article isn't a joke."
94,58,I don't care if it's a joke. I'm sorry but the CDC doesn't have a 'career' to save me. They say a mask to prevent a 'risk' of a disease that doesn't have a specific effect on you that has no impact on your health. They're not going to have a 'comfortable' policy. Is there a reason why the NHL doesn't have a helmet?
97,58,This is all just a bunch of wacky jokes.
101,58,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
58,52,I think it's a joke.
59,58,I'm a psychosurgeon. I've been in a similar situation. I went to a university and it was a good time to talk about my own health. The whole thing was a big deal and I'd never wanted to hear about it.

78,58,"This is a troll post about something you probably want to avoid on the news. The guy at the news said it was a joke, he's a twitch and he would have no idea why you'd be so pissed if the ACA weren't passed. The guy he's talking to isn't sarcastic he's just pointing out that this isn't a joke."
