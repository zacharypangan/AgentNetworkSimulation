81,34,CANNOTANSWER: Vaccination is not required for everyone unless the person is in an advanced stage of a clinical trial.
98,34,"It's a joke, but the OP needs to be aware of that. I think it's a great way to show how the guy is feeling about it. I think it's pretty much a joke about how a guy could be vaccinated, or how that person feels about it, but the joke also applies."
101,34,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
34,2,"It's a joke, but they're trying to protect me."

66,34,You seem very interested in the discussion. It's an interesting and very interesting topic and I can see why the guy is just pointing out a huge deficit and being overreacting.

71,34,"This is a cliched phrase. That was the same thing you described, but the wiki page is full of a list of examples."

34,14,You can't get a visa for a person with a mask unless they are in an advanced stage of a clinical trial. But you can get a visa for a person who wears a mask at a airport.
34,22,This isn't a joke about the government. It's a joke about how the U.S. isn't a democracy. It's a joke.
34,24,This is a very important subject.
40,34,"I mean, you were very ignorant about the facts, but the idea is that this is an issue, which they are trying to get out of. I’m not saying the government is the answer, but it is something that is very likely a problem. It’s not a sexist thing."
63,34,"The article states: ""This is a joke. "". Is that what I was referring to?"
65,34,I think wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
66,34,"IANAL, but when people say ""it's not a vaccine, it's an act of government"" as ""I think we're at a critical mass here and you're not against this"" - they can't even read the words like ""I don't think it's a vaccine, I'm against that."" So..."
71,34,"i agree that the US government isnt very clean or healthy, but in the US, there is less of it."
76,34,"I had a similar scenario when I was at a medical emergency where the CDC was bringing up the risk of an infection. It turned out to be a virus, which is why I decided to wear a mask. The CDC took me a day off work to take my son to the hospital, and now my son and I are getting tested on it."
81,34,"As a Canadian, I'd like to add that, even if I said they weren't required by law, the mask is a pretty bad idea to put on people who can't afford it and are only in a few years of clinical trials."

34,10,I think they are just trying to keep it secret.
34,14,We have a CDC that identifies all carriers as viruses and doesn't take away from it and puts masks on all carriers. They certify all cases. They do not have to get their licenses or other health care. Its not just a joke.
34,22,The US government is a democracy and is not going to come into play with the new law. They will be able to do what they want with a ban.

65,34,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.It is actually a joke. They are just putting in a very different set of guidelines than the government or CDC in terms of what they are doing.
66,34,"You don't need a mask to fight AIDS. They need to put it on, and you need a mask to stop the spread. You don't need a mask for AIDS, so you don't even need to be a doctor."

65,34,I don't know how the CDC isn't helping. They are just acting against the government's will.
66,34,Is that you? I'm sick and I'm not getting sick. Is that you?

It's about him putting on a mask so people can t die and it's funny that his head has to be kept from air, that's a big deal."
101,34,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
34,2,I don't know. But it seems a lot of people would never be able to understand why people need masks anymore.

34,24,Vaccination is a medical necessity and it isn't going to stop the spread of the virus.
40,34,It's actually a joke and a good idea.
63,34,It is a joke. It is not a joke. It is a joke. It is a joke. It is a joke. It is a joke.
65,34,"In the US, the medical industry has been a part of many policies aimed at protecting people from government."
66,34,Then why aren't you really interested in the discussion. It's an interesting and very interesting topic and I can see why the guy is just pointing out a huge deficit and being overreacting. But I find it incredibly sad that some people are denying the existence of a health care system and only trying to enlighten themselves into a culture where a health care system is an important part of life.
71,34,"I was wondering if they could tell you what it is like to be homeless in Georgia? I read about people who wear masks and found out they have a life in the US. They were not saying ""I'm a cliched person."""
76,34,"You're correct. The article demonstrates that the US government doesn't have the power to enforce laws, and that they don't have the authority to legally impose laws. There is a lot of propaganda on the web about this, but the article doesn't address it."

34,14,This is a joke! What a funny joke! This is not an actual joke. It's an opinion piece.
34,22,"[The CDC](http://www.cdc.gov/mashing/) is a part of the 'war on drugs' campaign, and they are using it to help people spread the virus. The CDC has no responsibility for policing government health care. They do not enforce or enforce a law, they just do not exist."
34,24,Vaccination is a medical necessity and it isn't going to stop the spread of the virus.
40,34,I think you have made a good point. There aren't any 'jokes' on a 'joke' like this but I do think that the ACA is a joke.
63,34,"""You're not a doctor, you're just asking for a sign that they know what it is and they're not putting it on their hands."""
65,34,"The health department is taking steps to stop this, and the government is doing its job."
66,34,This is a huge shitstorm that could turn out to be a great story of a horrible apocalypse.
71,34,"I'm not sure what the word ""cliched person"" is but the general concept that ""i think it's possible for someone to be in Georgia"" is also part of the term ""wearing a mask"", and it is the whole point of the term."
76,34,Vaccination is a medical necessity. It entails getting vaccinated. Wearing a mask outside or in your car alone or in your car alone your gullible and submissive not traits.
81,34,"I don't think there's any difference between a mask and a gun and it doesn't really help people unless they have a AIDS/AIDS patient. I think this is an interesting book on ""how much vaccination is required by law in the United States,"" and the two are misleading in how they're translated."
98,34,I don't think that's a joke.
101,34,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
34,2,"A CDC article has just been published about the problem of a huge deficit in health care. It states that the people who supposedly don't know what it is are going to suffer more than someone who is actually healthy, and are at the very least affected by the virus. It shows that some people are not comfortable with having the medical care they need, because it's just not common and is just not practical."
34,10,Vaccination isn't a problem to prevent. They are trying to stop the spread of a deadly virus.
34,14,"“You aren’t a doctor, you’re just asking for a sign that they know what it is and they’re not putting it on their hands.”"
34,22,A guy is making a joke that the CDC is just putting a blanket on people wearing masks and saying it's a joke is an absolute lie.
34,24,There aren't any laws against people wearing masks.
40,34,"A CDC employee in a hampstead of Chicago had a coworker who had an AIDS patient and his coworker had the same coworker, so there was that."
63,34,There are two kinds of masks for people.
65,34,"The idea of wearing a mask to prevent the spread of a virus is absurd, the CDC and the federal government are doing some pretty horrifying things for people who don't wear a mask when they don'."
66,34,This isn't about the mask. It's about what you can do to make a person better. It's not just a way for the government to evade government intervention. It's about how they can be proactive and effective in a disease threatening state that's very important to people.
71,34,"If you think a mask would be good for you, look up the ""fetus"" thing. If you do, then that is a terrible idea."
76,34,"If I were a doctor who had no idea how to go about dressing up as a woman in Texas and if I could go through a doctor and do my job well, I would have a lot of issues about what is acceptable in this country."
81,34,It's a joke that is actually really funny to you.
98,34,"The joke is the only one that fits. It's a joke that isn't one of those things that's funny. I like the people who make jokes about how ridiculous it is for us to want to see a movie about Trump, but I think the whole thing is just a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. The whole thing is a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke."
101,34,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
34,2,The CDC is still trying to do something to prevent the spread of a virus.
34,10,I would make a movie about this a joke.
34,14,"Vaccination is not a disease. AIDS is a disease. If you're not getting sick. AIDS isn't a disease. If you're a healthy adult who isn't carrying a mRNA or tRNA, you need a mask."
34,22,"The article that is published is actually pretty hilarious, but I don't see how it can be any good to anyone to do in a state where we are a democracy."
34,24,I would say it's not OK to say anything about people who wear a mask when they don't want to.
40,34,"...Is it possible that the President of the United States, is going to be able to work with the Congress to get rid of the President?"
63,34,Vaccination is not a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.
65,34,"The first sentence is a bit misleading, but it has a great quote to it, namely:"
66,34,"'A lot of the anti-virus groups are resentful, like the US, for allowing people to wear masks, but not to fight off the virus.'"
71,34,"I don't know if i understand what this means, but I will say that I think it's a very positive thing that the US government is in a position to stop the spread of the virus."
76,34,"This isn't the government, its the state."
81,34,I think that the movie is very funny.
98,34,I think that the joke in the movie is really a joke. But the whole thing is just a joke.
101,34,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
34,2,"So, the CDC is trying to prevent the spread of a virus."
34,10,"People will take it seriously, if they're not getting vaccinated and they are going to have AIDS if it is a 'problem' to prevent."
34,14,The only thing that matters here is that the vaccines are actually vaccines.
34,22,"""I think wearing a mask in public is a big part of stopping the spread of a virus. This isn't about the mask. It's about what you can do to make a person better."""
34,24,"I can't say that it's a joke, but I can say that it's a joke. It's not a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke."
40,34,"What if the ACA carries on? I am still interested in trying to understand why it is so important to protect people but I can't think of a good way to say ""I am trying to prevent the spread of a virus. The ACA is a joke."" and it does sound that it is a joke because people think it's a joke."
63,34,I think the main point of the article is to point out that wearing a mask doesn't help with the spread of a virus. It's a joke because it reflects on the government's willingness to go down that path.
65,34,"In a similar vein, the whole idea of having a joke is, ""It's actually very helpful."" But it's just a joke. It's not a joke.... but is it really that good?"
66,34,"It seems like a little too late to be frank. I can't blame you, but I will bet you that he is doing a good job of educating us about what the government can do to help the people in the country."
71,34,"As far as I know, the government is not authorized to keep people in their home countries."
76,34,This isn't a good idea - the article is about the government.
81,34,CannonSWER doesn't understand the title and he's trying to explain it.

101,34,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
34,2,The CDC isn't a government agency. And its not the government whose job it is.
34,10,I'm just trying to convey that this article is about the government not the government.
34,14,"[The CDC is the agency that is trying to control the spread of a virus, so there should be no govt mandate for a mask in federal facilities."
34,22,"Yes, it is an absolute joke. What's it about? The CDC's response is not that ""i think wearing a mask in public is a big part of stopping the spread of a virus."" It's that people who wear it in public are covered in a mask that isn't a joke. It's about what you can do to make a person better."""
34,24,"I agree that it's a joke. The article is about the US gov't trying to prevent the spread of a virus, and he doesn't understand the issue."
40,34,I think they are trying to make the idea of a mask a joke and I think they are trying to make it a joke.
63,34,"They can't really stop that kind of thing at the school, and they can't even start a public health department. Vaccination is a joke, because it's meant to stop people from getting sick."
65,34,"It's a joke, it's just a joke."
66,34,"""I do not know what to do on a day of sick days"""
71,34,Is there a 'hobbie' somewhere else? The US government seems to be more cliched than most people assume.

81,34,'I don't get it'.

34,24,"I read the title again. It's a joke. I'm not going to explain what I'm saying, but what is the headline that says. It doesn't make any sense to me."
40,34,"Yes I was a very ignorant person as I thought that the CDC would be a great choice to start an investigation, but it was obvious they were too busy trying to explain the situation, and if they wanted to give people a good reason to wear a mask."

66,34,It is a joke. It is a joke.
71,34,I listened to one of the people on a show in school on the subject of the hysteria. He said that people can be cruel. We could be mean or nasty to people. Is it OK to be a good guy and help the poor?
76,34,"It is a joke, but they are not threatening a lawsuit over the use of a mask. The CDC is trying to sue the person who wears a mask over it."
81,34,I would think that if the government is actually invading people and they could be as responsible as the 'Apocalypse' they would be making the government look good.
98,34,I think that’s a joke.

34,14,"In the article they said the government needs to come up with a ""price range,"" and to certify all carriers, they need to wear masks to combat infection and prevent a spread of AIDS."
34,22,I think the article is misleading.

40,34,"The CDC is the CDC of all affluent countries, and this is a joke, no joke."
