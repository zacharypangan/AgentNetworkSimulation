48,28,A good hat and a mask are both good idea in cases of infection. It's not really the government's job to make a joke.
48,30,The problem is that there isn't a clear clear message to be utterly and completely addressed by these people. It's not the government's job to make a joke. It's the public's. It's the government's job to make a joke.

50,48,I feel like it's time to call the CDC a joke. I am not against this. The CDC is making you uncomfortable. The federal government is helping to prevent the spread of AIDS. I believe the CDC is trying to prevent it.
55,48,It's a joke. It's not going to make a difference. The idea that people need to wear masks isn't something the government is trying to make out of an acceptable way to prevent the spread of a virus.

48,12,"I can't imagine what the CDC's mission is to do. A government must be on the hook for preventing a number of things, including getting the government to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS.
