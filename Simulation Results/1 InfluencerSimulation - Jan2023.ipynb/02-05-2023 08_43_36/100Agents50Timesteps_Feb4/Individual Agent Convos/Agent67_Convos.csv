91,67,"The official in the video said that the new helmet requirement was supposed to stop the spread of a virus, so when they say it should be done, it's a skunk."
99,67,I'm a vaccinated person and my doctor told me I should wear a mask when I was born because of a virus.
101,67,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
67,8,"That's not really that dumb, is it? I've been in a place I don't really understand how you can make the first comment."
88,67,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
91,67,The guy you wrote is referring to an old guy who is still going to die without the help of a mask.
99,67,"I've read that a lot of people equate wearing a mask with ""sick"" sex."
101,67,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
67,8,"They're doing some dumb thing in the video: they think the government should make helmets to help prevent the spread of a virus. They want to stop a certain amount of people getting sick, if they can't stop themselves from getting sick."
88,67,The first paragraph of the story is: Putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i ve done in my entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask.

91,67,It seems that the government doesn't have the ability to have an official that isn't involved with the problem. The problem is that there is no right or wrong way for them to say what they want.
99,67,The issue is that people don't like the idea of wearing a mask.
101,67,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."

91,67,A skunk isn't a skunk. A skunk isn't a skunk. A skunk isn't a skunk.
99,67,"I was wondering why the government was required to wear a mask, so the OP isn't making a joke."
101,67,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
67,8,"I’ve never really had sex with a man without a mask, though."
88,67,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
91,67,They're in a very bad spot. Obviously. There is a big difference between a skunk and a skunk.
99,67,"Vaccination is a medical necessity, it entails getting vaccinated. Its the way a patient dies, it's the way a patient is vaccinated and not their health."
101,67,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
67,8,You're not making a joke.
88,67,The first paragraph of the story is: putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i ve done in my entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask.
91,67,Then people like you are going to have to look at the title of the article and see if it helps. Is it worth your time?
99,67,"If you're not making a joke, then you're not making a joke. If you haven't made a joke about it, then you're making a joke about it."
101,67,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
67,8,No one likes the idea of the government trying to prevent spread of a virus. There's also a big difference between an actual person and a non-emergency vaccine.
88,67,The second paragraph is: Putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i ve done in my entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask
91,67,"""This is the only place I can take a rebuttal on this."""
99,67,I think it’s interesting that there are so many examples of people using a mask as a tool for preventing a virus from spreading. This kind of joke is common.
101,67,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
67,8,There are several ways of preventing spread of a virus and that's why there's so much talk of trying to prevent it in general. I don't think it's really worth the time it's not worth the time it's not worth it.
88,67,Putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i ve done in my entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask.

99,67,"If you're not making a joke, then you're making a joke about it."
101,67,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
67,8,"The article states that the mask can help prevent a virus from spreading because it is a part of the vaccination process, and it does not stop people from getting sick. So there is a big difference between a man posing as a skunk and a skunk. You're making a joke, but it's not."
88,67,It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
91,67,The article is a 'total misunderstanding' of a great movie. You can't simply tell the truth based on facts.
99,67,So the joke was about the health of the government.
101,67,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
67,8,"I would also like to emphasize that if people can be narcissistic, but not the right one, wearing a mask does not prevent the spread of a virus."
88,67,"A lot of people don't understand what's in their mask, it's not like they're not going to wear it if they're a bad person."
91,67,The NRA is a really dumb bunch of terrorists. I think they're doing a great job of getting this public out.
99,67,So the government is just shit when a non-vaccinated person isn't taking a sick pill?
101,67,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
67,8,"[This is the only place I can take a rebuttal on this."""
88,67,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
91,67,"It's not about 'the mask' it's about the fact that it's not a medical necessity or the ability to protect the human body. It's about whether it's necessary or not and if it isn't the correct way to do that, and what you're saying is ""it's not necessary""."
99,67,I think you're right that the government is a joke. But a petty joke is not a joke.
101,67,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
67,8,"I can't even imagine how disgusting it must be to have to wear a mask to stop a disease. But if it were me I would really want to have to say that the government should make a helmet to prevent a disease. The article doesn't say it would prevent a virus, but it says that people can be narcissistic and equate wearing a mask with ""sick"" sex. It says that people don't understand what's in their mask."
88,67,It's just part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
91,67,They're doing a great job of getting this public out. They're trying to get into this.
99,67,It's not a joke to the public.
101,67,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
67,8,They're going to have to make a mask because they don't want to be a part of the spread of a virus. They'll go through with it because they don't want to be involved in the spread of a virus. The government is a big ass ploy.
88,67,"A lot of people don't understand what's in their mask, it's not like they're not going to wear it if they're a bad person."
91,67,"""They are in a very bad spot. Obviously. There is a big difference between a skunk and a skunk."""

67,8,"'The government is a joke'. ""They are doing a great job of getting this public out. So the government is just shit when a non-vaccinated person isn't taking a sick pill? Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of a virus."
88,67,"I hate how much of a nutjob that is. If people were going to say it was to stop a virus because they had no idea it was there, they'd end up getting sick. I think people who put on a mask because they're sick would go with a more accurate quote that they didn't realize."
91,67,The article says the NRA is a terrorist group. They have been accused of promoting the spread of a virus.
99,67,"My wife is pregnant, and I wear a mask to protect her and her family. I'm a lawyer."
101,67,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
67,8,"It's a joke, and it doesn't sound like that's the main topic here, and I'm just stating it a bit."
88,67,I don't think it's too good for someone to go into a coma with a virus.
91,67,The article claims the NRA is a terrorist organization. The article states EPA & NRA have no authority to change the health care system and it would be more helpful for them to accept it.
99,67,"Vaccination is a medical necessity that prevents a patient from getting sick, and has the potential to help prevent infection, but I'm not saying it is a joke but it has the potential to be a joke."
101,67,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
67,8,"I think a person who has had sex with a male would get sicker from it because they don't know how to take the pill and go to the doctor, or even because they are allergic to the pills."
88,67,"You seem to have taken it too far. Isn't it a joke? The more you know, the more you understand, the more you realize how much your mask is needed. I mean, you've got a lot of stories that seem very relevant to what you wrote."
91,67,The guy in the video is referring to an old guy who is still going to die without the help of a mask.
99,67,I think the government is just trying to be a joke.
101,67,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
67,8,... and what is the reason for the lack of a vaccine?
88,67,"We have a problem with the word ""addict"" being a joke. We don't know what that means. It's like you don't have an actual reason to put on a mask. You don't understand why people don't understand the word ""addict"" being a joke."
91,67,The NRA is a group that is trying to push people to stop them from promoting a virus. The article does not mention the EPA. The author doesn't know how to be a good guy.
99,67,"Yes, a joke because it is a joke."
101,67,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
67,8,"Why doesn't a guy that was never vaccinated with an adenovirus, who did have the vaccinated guy to do something different?"

91,67,"""In the US the government is a terror organization. They have been accused of promoting the spread of a virus."""

88,67,"It's a joke, not a joke, and you should probably read it. The fact that it has to do with having a lot of experience means that people aren't going to actually use it."
91,67,"I feel like the article is misleading in its characterization, based on the fact that they are trying to do something to stop people being exposed to it. The article is very misleading, because the AMA cited in the article is very long. I'm not arguing that OP is right. I'm just making an argument that the article is misleading."
99,67,Why do people keep wearing their masks? That's silly.
101,67,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
67,8,"They've also said that they think a mask doesn't help, but that they're supposed to be used in a non-vaccinated person's defense against an unvaccinated person's illness."
88,67,I'm the one that doesn't get it.
91,67,It's very possible that the AMA is misleading because it's supposed to have a broader impact on a group of people and not only the AMA.

101,67,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
67,8,The AMA is about people who wear masks to prevent the spread of a virus.

101,67,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
67,8,I'd say it's a pretty good idea to get a vaccine. I would be okay with a little less of a joke as far as the public goes. I'd prefer to think about it like a joke. It wouldn't hurt to do so. If I were you I would be a nutjob.
88,67,"I think it's better to say 'I think it's funny because some people do it, and it doesn't make them feel better."

99,67,"I've been vaccinated myself and when it came to my sex life, I thought that I should wear a mask to keep people from getting sick. Then, as a kid I grew up with a sick clone who died, the health care was essentially the same and that's just about it."

99,67,I am not sure where he is but a lot of people know someone who has never worn a mask and the joke is overblown. I know people who are vaccinated and have never worn one. This is a real problem and it is not a joke.

91,67,I know it was about a guy spits a virus into a dog and he is in an AMA and he doesn't even know what a skunk is. But in actuality that guy isn't a skunk.

88,67,"I think a lot of people ARE going to say this, or that they have no idea what a nutjob is."
