60,16,A guy in California in the 80's was wearing his mask to protest the invasion of Haiti. That was his only inauguration day. I'm still pretty sure this was all his first real election.
60,22,Yes you are right - it is a virus and it sabotages the ability to be vaccinated but it will not stop unless you are vaccinated so if you are vaccinated in the near future you should also be on a mask if you are vaccinated if that happens.
60,27,You dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that

60,33,"I've always wondered what a mask is about, but this sounds sexist to me :)"
60,40,"'It's a terrible thing. I don't like it. 'I don't like it, but it's very embarrassing to look at on the big screen."
60,43,"i agree with you that a lot of people in that thread are talking about a mask, you should consider wearing a mask"
60,44,"I can see why some people want to believe that wearing a mask helps stop the spread of a virus, but I also want to believe that wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
60,55,Do you want to be the one to post this in the comments?
63,60,We gotta fuck ourselves and stop pretending to be the next king of the health department...
68,60,The truth has been found out for the last few weeks

74,60,"TWitchCon is not a state event. I'm from Georgia. If a state event has to get to state capitol I'd go to either Twitchcon or DC's, because you can't afford to attend the event."
79,60,> wearing a mask or get the jab if they want not by force
83,60,"Isn't that why the masks aren't in the game anymore? If so, I think you have a really good chance to win."
94,60,The people who wear masks don't necessarily wear masks to prevent the spread of a virus.
99,60,"I like wearing masks and I feel a lot better with them, but I don't want to be a dick about the karma."
60,4,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
60,15,There is a reason why the first part of the title of the thread is 'wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. What does wearing a mask with a mask have to do with the illness?
60,16,"As a Georgian who enjoys a bit of the sexism I've got to say it's an incredibly sexist way to take my hair - I've only ever seen it in my face. It's like saying that someone who doesn't wear a mask will have a very hard time in a situation where she's actually in a sexism mood - but she's not doing it because she doesn't want to, and that is why people should put sexism first. That's not"
60,22,"Yes, the masks are removed from the game, and they're used to stop people from going to parties."
60,27,"So the other day, when a guy went to a state convention, he went to a TWitchCon, where he was asked what a mask was and what he was going to wear. I was like..."
60,31,... but nobody wants to talk about it.
60,32,"You have a bad day. If you get the chance, you have to give it to the other person. You need to work out, I don't know who the fuck sucks with you, but a bad day will not make you a bad person, and in the worst possible way will not make you a good person. You just don't have to do the fucking thing."
60,33,Wearing a mask can actually aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
60,40,Is it possible that the virus is a threat to anyone else? The reason I am posting this is that people are actually getting sick.
60,43,"It's more likely to happen in a real event, because they know that wearing a mask will get them sick. They get them sick because they are infected. They don't get it until they are infected. They don't get it for fun when they are out in public. But they don't get the virus because they don't want to fight the virus, they just think that they don't want it. If they are just trying to use it to try and prevent a virus and cause a problem, and if you don't like it, you"
60,44,"This is a joke. You should never wear a mask and your life is over, and you can't do that."

63,60,"My girlfriend said her father took the newest strain of the virus and he is really worried about it, but she still has it on her and it's not a virus."
68,60,"In the movie ""The Black Panthers"", it says that ""The black Panthers"" are the first team to go through the XII to be president."
72,60,"i love people, i hope he will become a president sometime soon."
74,60,"If you are going to go to TWitchCon, it's going to be more fun."
79,60,"The problem is that this doesn't get better. There's nothing wrong with wearing a mask or a jab. It makes me uncomfortable for someone who doesn't have the courage to do so, or to go to the police."
83,60,That's really interesting.. I have a lot of fans that will say the same things about me because I love watching and watching people wear their masks as well.
94,60,I would never wear a mask.
99,60,"Well I'm really not a big fan of a lot of things, so I'm just being a narcissistic prick who has to be told not to wear a mask."
60,4,I don't understand why people aren't aware that wearing a mask is not to reduce the spread of the virus.
60,15,That's a good question to ask for clarification.
60,16,"Honestly, I don't think that the joke is true. It's a joke. It's a joke. I wouldn't wear a mask if it weren't for the virus and it's not a joke. It's just a joke."

60,27,"Wearing a mask in a party is really weird. When you wear a mask at the party, your hair looks different, because you're sick, and you're not infected."
60,31,I've been on the team to prevent a virus that I've seen on people all day long and I don't even get it.
60,32,"No, that's the joke."
60,33,No one would want to talk about this.
60,40,"What does being infected cause? Are you getting sick? I mean you got sick, not sick, and you're sick?"
60,43,"Wearing a mask will help prevent a virulent disease. I'm sorry, but this guy's not on TWitchCon."
60,44,People are just having fun in the comments.
60,55,I'm glad the virus has gone away.
63,60,"The CDC are threatening to make sure no one gets caught by the virus. If they are, they cann't be held responsible. They can put a mask on to prevent them from being infected if they do not put it on."
68,60,I think he's having a good moment.
72,60,This was not a joke. RIP you scumbag.
74,60,"I hate the idea of a man wearing a mask when the party is all over the place in a mall. I'm a millennial and I'd probably be more than willing to put up with people who don't wear masks because he's not a big fan of twitchcon, he's the only guy I know who can wear a mask. I like to have fun with friends and see the good stuff, but the bad things can only be done when people don't wear them. I'm more than willing to put up with people who"

99,60,"I don't have any other problems here, but I have a little friend who is pretty much the same as me who's in a narcissistic state and is allergic to the virus. His family is a big fan of the disease, so I can't even comment on his ""advantages."""
60,4,> I wouldn't wear a mask if it weren't for the virus and it's just a joke. It's just a joke.
60,15,People are trying to explain why they have no idea about the effects of viruses on the population. And it's been a while since I've seen people wear masks to get the virus off people.
60,16,Why is the CDC working on it?
60,22,I'm going to have to agree with you that this is a joke.
60,27,"I would never want to go to a party if I had to go, not wear a mask at all. If I was on the team it would help prevent the spread of a virus. The CDC and my friend ARE causing a lot of problems."
60,31,"The truth is he tries to make it a joke, and the reason he is doing this is so that he can show his narcissistic self respect, not have the virus spread."

60,40,"I'm not saying that there isn't a legitimate reason to wear a mask, but I'm saying that there is one problem with the government's measures. I just wanted to put that aside for the sake of it being a joke."
60,43,"It's a joke, and I understand that the CDC is not going to have any control over how it spreads so that people can't get sick."
60,44,I'm going to get some good stuff done if you don't mind me asking.' I want to be the only person who can wear a mask in a party.
60,55,I wore my mask in high school. During the day I had to get off the bus to the hospital to get into a nasa office and scream. It was uncomfortable.
63,60,I'm assuming it was the CDC that spotted the newton virus and made the decision to wear a mask.
68,60,"And then, on top of that, the sexism issue, he was wearing the mask because he had a gun, then the helmet got smashed, so he'd have to wear a hoodie. Is this true? He's been saying ""Oh I'm not a racist, but that's not a problem for me."""

74,60,"I feel like the only good thing about a mask is that it makes a lot of people uncomfortable in their room, so it becomes like the ol''fucking shit."
79,60,CANNOTANSWER OP
83,60,I think this is really weird. The whole point of a mask is to not wear a mask. It's to stop the spread of the virus.
94,60,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. That is a joke. It's also what a doctor would do if he tried to prescribe a new medicine that prevents people from having the disease.
99,60,"I had a similar reaction to a quote from the wiki article: ""They say that women have to wear masks for fear of the stigma that it will cause? There is a reason why you can't tell people the truth. I've got a question. What is the big deal?"
60,4,"A woman in my high school told me that she had the virus and was going to wear it every week. I was horrified by it and he was horrified at the same time and then was like, wow, this is a horrible joke. I don't know how I can stop the spread of the virus or how this can get over if people wear it. But the fact that she was wearing it and they were sick and her face was pretty freaking weird."
60,15,"> I would never want to go to a party if I had to go, not wear a mask at all. If I was on the team it would help prevent the spread of a virus."
60,16,The joke doesn't stop the spread of the disease. It stops the spread. I'm pretty sure this has anything to do with the virus.
60,22,CANNOTANSWER OP
60,27,It's a joke. That's the one that makes me want to have the joke.
60,31,"It's a joke, IMO. The whole point of a mask is to not wear a mask. It's also what a doctor would do if he tried to prescribe a new medicine that prevents people from having the virus. That is a joke. It's also what a doctor would do if he tried to prescribe a new medicine that prevents people from having the virus. There is a reason why you can't tell people the truth. I've got a question."
60,32,"So, the idea of a mask is so that it will keep people from being sick, and not be a problem for them?"
60,33,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
60,40,It's also what a doctor would do if he tried to prescribe a new medicine that prevents people from having the virus.
60,43,>I don't understand why people aren't aware that wearing a mask is not to reduce the spread of the virus.
60,44,"Honestly, I don't think I've ever seen anyone use a mask at the party, because I didn't really like it."
60,55,I've seen people wear a mask for the virus and it is just a joke.
63,60,"I've never heard of the term ""Mask for it"" in any way, so I don't understand why people want to hear it when their parents aren't actually wearing them."
68,60,I've always wondered if there is an obvious reason that they aren't covering up the situation by covering the fact that the guy is wearing a mask.
72,60,"I was watching the show where the guy on the front row was wearing a mask in a skunk costume. I was able to feel a slight resemblance to him, he said that it was all about the skunk in a mask."
74,60,Vaccines aren't even legal anymore. They're not going to help with this disease.
79,60,I can't say for certain what that is.
83,60,"So the President has just put on a mask and is taking it down. We should have had a hat, but I'm going to do that."
94,60,You mean to put on a mask? You can do whatever you want a mask for. Vaccination is not mandatory for everyone unless the person is in an advanced stage of a clinical trial.
99,60,"As a woman, I would not want to be the rabidly anti-virus nut. I'd rather be in the habit of not having a vaccinated child and not wanting to have to go to an infection prone doctor for help with your health."
60,4,> You mean to put on a mask? You can do whatever you want a mask for. Vaccination is not mandatory for everyone unless the person is in an advanced stage of a clinical trial.
60,15,I think what they are trying to answer is: People are trying to explain why they have no idea about the effects of viruses on the population.
60,16,"So, if the guy didn't wear a mask, how many people would not wear a mask to protest?"
60,22,It is a joke. It is a joke.
60,27,"Well, if you're looking for some kind of protection, you could wear a mask and see a doctor."
60,31,"I've heard about a guy who wore a skunk mask when he went to the party. They were wearing a skunk mask and were a joke. I'm not sure he got any sort of advice on the skunk masks. He said that it was a joke, it was a joke and it was a joke. I've seen him do it to make it easier for him to put it on because his face was so freaking weird. He made it harder to get over. The joke is that he should not have"
60,32,Vaccination is not mandatory for everyone unless the person is in an advanced stage of a clinical trial.
60,33,Vaccines aren't even legal anymore. They're not going to help with this disease. I can't say for certain what that is.
60,40,"This is why you have to talk about it a lot. People are always going to think that if you don't have a mask, you should. But it's the government's job to help keep people from getting sick."
60,43,I think I'm the one who would laugh so hard and then just get into my raccoon costume.
60,44,Vaccination is not mandatory for everyone unless the person is in an advanced stage of a clinical trial.
60,55,I can't imagine the idea that you can make a joke with anyone that doesn't think they're actually aware that wearing a mask is not to reduce the spread of a virus. It's very similar to why you should eat some of the meat you like.
63,60,People wear a mask to keep people alive because people are infected with HIV/AIDS.
68,60,CANNOTANSWER: The mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
72,60,"You don't think it's funny, huh?"
74,60,"The President is going to get involved in a bunch of hats, but in the same group of people who aren't wearing masks (like most people, that's what I'm talking about) that are being treated like you are. It's not like they have to wear their mask in order to do anything. They have to put up with someone else being able to be in the group."
79,60,The issue is that it is not a crime to use a mask.
83,60,We need more government agencies that have the power to stop this.
94,60,"People can wear them. The health and safety of the average human in this country are important to them. But it isn't like it is a joke for them to wear a mask and to say, ""It's no big deal."""
99,60,"There's an article from 2006 that says it's not a joke, but a joke..."
60,4,Why is the president willing to do it because it is not a crime to use a mask?
60,15,I just wanted to throw you the best joke of the week... that was a lot of shit. But this guy was a skunk. He's a skunk.
60,16,"I can think of many more that you are not going to get the reference to, for that matter. You just say that a mask makes you look weird, a person isn't ok with the 'i'm going to wear a mask' joke."
60,22,The op is simply saying the government will not be able to change anything. That is why people do not wear the masks.
60,27,"Wearing a mask at a party is weird. When you wear a mask, your hair looks different, because you're sick, and you're not infected."
60,31,"I just learned from reading this article that wearing a mask is not a crime. But it's a joke that nobody is willing to talk about. There's an article from 2006 that says it's not a joke, but a joke."
60,32,"And if the doctor didn't want to be a part of it, the idea of it is a joke."
60,33,"People gotta get out. The President has said it's not funny for people to wear their masks, but it's actually a joke."
60,40,A skunk mask is a joke. A skunk is just a joke. It's like being infected and in a prank or a crime.
60,43,The problem with this is that we don't know what the problem is. What a ridiculous joke.
60,44,Vaccination is not mandatory for everyone unless the person is in an advanced stage of a clinical trial. Vaccines aren't even legal anymore. They're not going to help with this disease.
60,55,"That's what's gonna happen, when you get on the bus to the doctor, or you get in trouble for bringing up a health issue, when you get into a troubled relationship."
63,60,CDC is not a private body with no mandate.
68,60,It's not a joke. He wants to make the point that they aren't able to take into consideration the issue of whether or not a person is not infected.
72,60,"Basically, the most ridiculous joke I've ever heard is that the skunks in the mask were very cute and very funny. It was a joke that made them seem like scum."
74,60,"They are not helping the disease, they are helping to prevent the spread."
79,60,"""We're not the government's system of mandates, we're the Government's system of mandates"". I read 'I wear a mask outside of a vehicle' and ""I don't think it's a crime to use a mask."""
83,60,I think the whole point of a mask is to not wear a mask. It's to stop the spread of the virus.
94,60,I'm going to guess that's what the article suggests:
99,60,"I'm not getting what your pointing at, but the premise is the same. I'm trying to convey the message."
60,4,You are just an idiot and you shouldn't wear the mask if you don't like it.
60,15,"""People are trying to explain why they have no idea about the effects of viruses on the population."""
60,16,A lot of this is just a common joke. But they're probably not going to censor it and they're going to be just as stupid.
60,22,It is a joke. It is a joke. It is a joke.
60,27,>I just wanted to throw you the best joke of the week... that was a lot of shit. But this guy was a skunk.
60,31,You're telling a joke that's funny?
60,32,We have to get out of that situation.
60,33,CDC is not a private body with no mandate.
60,40,"There's a video about this recently, but I have to say it was good."
60,43,The whole point of a mask is to not wear it. It's to stop the spread of the virus.
60,44,">When you get on the bus to the doctor, or you get in trouble for bringing up a health issue, when you get into a troubled relationship."
60,55,Why do you want to be the next king of the health department? Because that's the sort of thing that gets us all so angry.
63,60,"The CDC is threatening to make sure no one gets caught by the virus, but if they are, they can't be held responsible. So he is making a troll joke. He is not a troll."
68,60,"The movie is good, but it isn't funny."
72,60,"Why did he say skunk in the ACA say it is sexist to be able to wear a mask? Did he think it was a joke and didn't actually say it is funny, or was it just a joke?"
74,60,A bunch of hats. The only difference between a mask and a dickhead is that a dickhead is infected. The President has the right to put up with the disease if he is a dickhead.
79,60,"I'm not a lawyer, I'm not a lawyer. I am not a lawyer."
83,60,"I like to think if the government is helping the spread of the virus, then it's better to get a new mask to prevent it from spreading."
94,60,I don't understand why anyone would think that the government should not use these things. You don't need to be a lawyer to be a doctor. There's literally nothing to be said for it.
99,60,[Dave] A lot of people are sick with the flu and we all are.
60,4,The movie I was watching about it was a joke from someone at the school who's mother was an infected dickhead. I was horrified and a bit disgusted. Especially since she had an infection in the face and it was so bad she wouldn't wear the mask.
60,15,And why are all the jokes about this?
60,16,Because the joke doesn't stop the spread of the disease.
60,22,i would go after people that do not wear the masks.
60,27,"I think the whole point of a mask is to not wear it, it is to stop the spread of a virus. You are just an idiot and you shouldn't wear it if you don't like it."
60,31,Isn't that what a lot of Americans are sick with the flu and we all are?
60,32,"That's just a weird little joke... But in that particular context, I'm surprised it is a joke."
60,33,You are a joke. Everyone is a skunk.
60,40,Why aren't we talking about it? We're talking about a joke!
60,43,...I'm not a lawyer. I am not a lawyer. I am not a lawyer.
60,44,The whole point of a mask is to not wear it. It's to stop the spread of the virus.
60,55,"I've seen a LOT of people wear a mask for the virus, but it is just a joke. The whole point of a mask is to not wear it. It's to stop the spread of the virus."
63,60,"The point of the article is that this is a joke, not that it's a troll joke."
68,60,"I like the movie and I like it a lot. I mean, it does make sense, but it isn't going to work if everyone does. It's not the end all of the world. I am sorry but I don't think it's funny."
72,60,A skunk man needs to wear a mask to prevent a virus from spreading into someone else's house.
74,60,"You're an adult, not a woman."
79,60,You don't have the right to know what to do about this. You have the right to feel good about yourself. The government has done this with zero evidence. There's a lot of people who are aware of it and don't necessarily agree with it.
83,60,It's a joke.
94,60,"Until some people stop wearing a mask because a virus infects people that haven't been infected with it. This is all a joke. And if you don't understand why people believe this, they don't know where the joke comes from."
99,60,Is the CDC doing any more research on what a good time of the year is? Is it just a joke? The whole thing is a joke. It's a very important part of the government's policy - to protect the public.

60,22,It's a joke. I think it's a really good time to give your mother a hand to use and the government will be able to tell you exactly what to do.
60,27,"I am just gonna give a little context. If people wear a mask and are sick, that is a joke, as I'm sure there's some kind of social problem with it. The best joke of the week is if you don't think the government is doing anything about it. The government has done nothing about it."
60,31,"I have a feeling the people who say that wearing a mask is not a joke or that the public needs a doctor, they're just joking around with the idea of the virus."
60,32,The point of this is that the whole thing is a joke.

74,60,"TIL that, while I don't agree with everyone who is saying the government has a right to ban certain'masks' and the president has the right to refuse to wear them, they are not allowed to prevent the spread of a virus."

74,60,Why are we able to have a joke about TWitchCon? Are you in Georgia?
79,60,It's not a prank.
83,60,I don't think the AMA was really funny. The AMA was a great one. The only thing I got out of it was that it's in r/emergency because it seems to have more to do with the NRA and Obama than anything else. It wasn't funny.
94,60,I think that this is one of the reasons why the government isn't responsible for preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS. It isn't a joke and it isn't a joke. It's a joke that people say it isn't necessary.

60,33,They don't know what the CDC is. I know a guy who wears a mask when he can't leave office. I haven't really asked him what the problem is with a mask. It sounds like the joke is pretty funny.
60,40,So you're saying there is no real reason for people to wear a mask?
60,43,The whole point of a mask is to not wear it. It's to stop the spread of the virus. It's just a joke. I think it's a joke.
60,44,I've always loved the idea of the government using their power to protect the people who are sick. But the government is so cruel.

74,60,"It's a good question, but the question is... would they be able to make a joke about it?"
79,60,"They aren't about pranks, they're about it being an anti-government joke."
83,60,Why not let the team run the game without a mask? Then why don't they have it on?
94,60,"As a doctor, I wouldn't wear a mask. The only way I would wear a mask is if I were in a clinical trial. I would not recommend this type of thing."

60,27,We have to have a joke.
60,31,"I don't know why they aren't joking. This is a very common joke, a lot of the time a joke is just a joke. I don't understand why people are using this joke to talk about it."
60,32,The word 'jaggery' is a prank. There is no such thing as a joke. It's a joke.
60,33,This joke makes me cringe more than I'd be if I were to make a joke about the government.
60,40,"It doesn't have to be a joke. It's a prank. The people trying to have people in a public ward like you don't think you have a valid job and not a problem. I don't know where that line comes from, but I can see why it would be considered a joke."
60,43,The ACA isn't the problem. This is a joke. It's a joke.
60,44,"There are different kinds of things the government is doing, one is a joke and one isn't. It's a bit much to make fun of, and in many ways has nothing to do with it. But what is it about them that is the problem?"

63,60,"I don't think it's a joke, but I just think it's a joke. You gotta stop pretending to be the next king of the health department, right?"
68,60,I'm just saying the fact that he says it's funny that the guy is wearing the mask to protect himself would have a negative impact on the health of the person who's wearing the mask.

79,60,No. I have to make a joke.
83,60,Why don't they get a new mask? It's a joke.
94,60,It's a joke to be sure. It is a joke that the government is responsible for protecting people from being infected. It's a joke that people think it is not necessary. It's a joke to be sure people in the field are aware that.
99,60,The people who pushed for the government to do it didn't care about what people think about it.
60,4,This is what's in the article.
60,15,"The fact that the AMA was a joke was a joke. It's just the same joke, OP has just called it ""my favorite joke""."
60,16,"There's nothing funny about a joke, or an issue. Just to let you know that they are using a joke to stop the spread of the virus."
60,22,This is a joke. Is it a joke. Is it a joke?
60,27,The CDC needs to take a step back from the joke and talk about how it's going to affect their public health. The CDC and their cdc are the ones who need to keep up with the joke.
60,31,I'd have to make a joke and I'd be embarrassed. I can't even stand what that is.
60,32,"They're going to go after the problem with the people who are sick, which is ridiculous. The fact that there are two kinds of people that are not sick will make a joke very uncomfortable."
60,33,CDC's goal is to prevent people from spreading the virus and the other problems they've identified with people a lot more often.
60,40,"IANAL but this was written by [NAME] in response to a joke about the government and he said ""If you get sick with a virus, it is not a joke."
60,43,A prank. I think it is a joke. It's a joke.
60,44,"If you have a problem with your health, then you have a problem. That's the real problem."
60,55,"A common joke is that if you relive the fact that you're sick, and you actually are sick, you're not sick."
63,60,What exactly is a joke?
68,60,The article is about the people getting mad about the nutjobs. It’s about how they think the government is gonna make it all about them.
72,60,I agree that wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. I'm a psych specialist and a doctor.
74,60,As someone from Florida I can say that it's just another joke about the government that's making people uncomfortable.
79,60,"You can be an anti-government skunk, but you have to make a joke that it's against the law."
83,60,"I think the most interesting thing here is that there is an AMA about something that I would have voted for or not supported if I wasn't a president, that I could have said a few things and it just makes the whole thing seem like a jerk. I mean, I have no problem with a skunk, but it was funny because I thought it was the most important part of this AMA. The AMA has to be about a legitimate problem with the health care system. There is no way to deal with it, and even though there are good reasons,"
94,60,Vaccination is a joke.
99,60,"In my opinion, it's the government and the people who support it."
60,4,I don't see how that was a joke about the CDC or any health authority. I know you're a doctor but this is a legitimate joke.
60,15,Why don't you just use the word fucking and say it in a joke?
60,16,It's a joke. A lot of the jokes they make tend to be funny.
60,22,"No, it isn't a joke. A lot of people don't understand that it's a joke."
60,27,"So he was like, ""I want to wear a mask when I'm sick."""
60,31,You've been a doctor for four years and have never heard of someone wearing a skunk mask?
60,32,I can't believe the actual article isn't going to include the AMA.
60,33,The article says it was written by [NAME] who's a doctor who's been sick for 5 years and is no longer a doctor.
60,40,The joke about being sick with the virus is one of the most misunderstood and unfounded statements on a serious subject. It was only just a joking joke. It’s not like this is an opinion of a politician if it was one of them.
60,43,It's a joke if the government is not allowed to control it.
60,44,"The AMA is written by [NAME] in response to a joke about the government and he said ""If you get sick with a virus, it is not a joke. A prank. I think it is a joke. If you have a problem with your health, then you have a problem. That's the real problem."""

79,60,The only prank that I can believe is that the 'trash' on the white house is about the white house and he is trying to repress a certain anti-government sentiment.
83,60,AMA isn't about the health care system. It's about the government helping the spread of a virus.
94,60,That's a pretty good way to start off. I'm a big nutcase.
99,60,I think it was the people making the joke.
60,4,It's only a joke. That's a joke. The joke is about the government helping to prevent the spread of a virus.

60,32,People just say it's not a joke.
60,33,A doctor who wasn't an expert on HIV and you can't see where the question comes from.
60,40,It's not like people are making jokes and this joke makes a lot of sense because if it is the joke it's not actually about the government and not about the people who are being a joke.

60,32,It's not a joke because people are making it out to be a prank. It's a joke about the fact that people are getting sick and the government is avoiding helping the spread of a virus.
60,33,ahh the government is being cruel. you're so ignorant about HIV that you're actually putting off getting an AMA because you don't know what it is about?
60,40,A friend of mine once got sick with a dang mask. I took it off because I had no idea there was anything there in the story about him. I was terrified. He didn't need a mask because it was a joke about the government's policy to prevent the spread.

60,33,Is this a good point? I just don't think it makes a good joke.
60,40,I like your perspective. You can't be as a joke or as a joke. A joke is a joke and it's a prank. I'm a joke.
60,43,"The fact that the article states ""You shouldn't wear a mask as much as you want"" and ""I think it's the whole point of a mask."""
60,44,"As the poster said, ""I'm a dick about the joke. I'm just being a nasa idiot."
60,55,I don't think the whole point of the mask is that it is a joke. It's a joke. People shouldn't wear a mask if they feel uncomfortable.
63,60,The CDC should have taken a back seat to stopping the spread of a virus. I think they are not doing anything about it. It's just not funny.
68,60,This is a pretty important joke that I don't get. It's a joke.
72,60,I think we're at the end of this thread. I think the AMA is a good idea and it isn't a joke.
74,60,"I've been to a couple of those. It's not a joke, but it seems like a joke that is about the government. And I'm not sure if you're a conservative or not, but there's no way I'd be a bit surprised if you're actually from Georgia or if you're just an American."
79,60,"[Cannot agree with any of them], which I'm not really able to find, is actually one of many examples of a prank by some people."
83,60,The only problem he had with the AMA was that it seemed like it had to do with the ACA and Obama being President and not a joke.
94,60,Vaccination isn't mandatory for everyone unless the person is in an advanced stage of a clinical trial.
99,60,"The article that says that it's not a joke, but a joke, is misleading."
60,4,>I think it's funny
60,15,The CDC is basically being an asshole for calling it a joke.
60,16,"No, he didn't say the joke was funny. It's funny that they've taken a back seat to the situation. Vaccines aren't legally allowed anymore. Vaccination isn't even legal anymore. They're not going to help combat the spread of the virus. The only problem is the article that says that it's not a joke, but a joke."
60,22,He's being a fucking narcissist.
60,27,I'm going to have to take a break. But the article is saying something about the lack of understanding and a joke about this. I am still sceptical and not sure what the AMA is.
60,31,They have all the facts to show why it's a joke. What is a joke?
60,32,"Honestly, I think a lot of people in this thread don't understand how the AMA is being misleading. It just seems like a joke in the context of the story. And for all intents and purposes, I'm a joke."
60,33,AMA: I'm actually going to be on a trip to the USA and this is one of the more interesting and interesting AMA's that will occur on here. I think it's a great idea.
60,40,The CDC is putting a mask on a lot of people for fun. They are putting it on people who would otherwise be not in the picture.
60,43,I think a joke is a joke. I think a joke is a joke.
60,44,It's about how I believe the government is preventing spreading of viruses.
60,55,"Well, I know a lot of people who wear the mask to save them from infection, but I think there aren't any that are trying to make the jokes out of any of them. It seems like the article is just an attempt to make a joke for the sake of the AMA."
63,60,I don't think that's a joke. I think that people are just being a little selfish.
68,60,"""...I like the movie and I like it a lot. I mean, it does make sense, but it's not funny. I'm sorry but I don't think it's funny. I'm sorry but I don't think it's funny."","
72,60,"Honestly I don't know that's what AMAs are, but i can't say for sure what the AMA was about. What's the difference?"
74,60,The President is still a Republican. I like the idea of him wearing a mask.
79,60,So the CDC is making fun of the government because it's a prank. I know that you're going to want to say what's being made fun of.
83,60,I just gotta take a long breath and sit back and watch the games. It's a lot of pressure and you know it. But they should stop. Because in the future they'll want to make it to the end of the day.
94,60,I'm a guy who says they were a joke but that isn't their main topic.
99,60,"I can understand the joke but I think if you're going to get a joke like this, it's too dangerous to wear a mask - it's also dangerous to have a mask on. I don't understand why people want to get a flu vaccine, it's because people don't want to know whether or not they get the virus."
60,4,A prank?!
60,15,What I like to hear about the president is that he wears a mask and wants to use a mask to get a vaccinated vaccine and that he's going to wear a mask to help prevent the spread of the virus.
60,16,"The article is misleading. I'm pretty sure it's an actual joke, which I'm not sure people are saying is true, but the fact that it's not a joke in this context is completely irrelevant."
60,22,I feel the article is completely apathetic to someone who is getting the jokes.
60,27,This is the story of my childhood. I was in the army for a very long time and this is the reason why I started to wear a mask and I would just stare into the camera and have a look at my eyes and laugh. I'm not a very good person.
60,31,"This is just a good joke. I'd say everyone knows it's a joke, but it's pretty common joke, but it's not common joke."
60,32,"A lot of people in this thread are not averse to r/Racists. They are aware of the existence of ""pranks""."
60,33,The movie isn't the only joke that made it to the top of the sub. I'm not a doctor and I don't think it's a good idea. It's a joke.
60,40,">The CDC is basically being an asshole for calling it a joke. No, he didn't say the joke was funny."
60,43,I think a lot of people in this thread are being so funny.
60,44,''Is a mask part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus?'''
60,55,"Aside from being funny, I've seen this article about people putting a mask on their friends for fun, just for fun."
63,60,People who are able to recognize how sick someone is with a virus and are using them for a purpose is a joke.
68,60,"No, he's not."
72,60,I think it is an effective way to bring a joke out of a joke. You are a prick.
74,60,"It's not a joke, it's a joke."
79,60,"""A skunk stung my face. How does that even work? It would be a very bad idea to not wear a mask in a public place. There is no need for a vaccine. Are you a doctor, or a doctor? Because you're sick of having sex with an adult. Vaccination is a joke, but it's illegal."""
83,60,I didn't get it. I saw someone else doing it.
94,60,The CDC and the CDC are doing an awful lot to help the public. They are trying to get people to take it back and stop it.
99,60,Vaccination is illegal. It is an important part of protecting people from a deadly virus. Vaccination isn't mandatory by the government. They are trying to make it illegal to make it enforceable.
60,4,"Vaccination is illegal in the US, and the U.S. is not one of the states that allows the vaccine to be administered outside of the United States."
60,15,Why is that joke so funny if people aren't interested in hearing about the joke? Because there is no joke on a subject that makes them want to watch it.
60,16,The joke doesn't stop the spread of the virus.
60,22,It is a joke. It is a joke. It is a joke. I think it's funny for the government to do a good job keeping the people and communities safer. I think it's funny for the CDC to do a good job keeping the people and communities safer.
60,27,It's a joke because the CDC isn't supposed to be doing anything about it. It's a joke because they want to stop a lot of people getting sick.
60,31,"The problem is that people don't get to decide what to say and when they do, the government doesn't have the authority to give a shit about it. This is just a good joke."
60,32,"It's not a joke, it's just one of those things that is easily fallen off of. People are making it seem like a joke, it's just that it makes them uncomfortable, and they're making it sound like a joke."
60,33,I'm sorry but I'm not a doctor. I'm sick of having sex with the skunk and this is the most interesting and exciting joke of the year.
60,40,I am going to be a r/science nerd with a bit of a hard time seeing people like he's not going to make it any more and say that I can't relate to anyone other than he has a big problem with rape.
60,43,Were you watching a movie? I... I'm not sure if they've ever seen it.
60,44,People are just having fun in the comments. (Which I like to hear about the president is that he wears a mask and wants to use a mask to get a vaccinated vaccine and that he's going to wear a mask to help prevent the spread of the virus.
60,55,"I'm a medical professor, so I'd say it's interesting that an article from the last two months is just a joke that has been around for a while."
63,60,Vaccination is a joke.
68,60,It's a joke.
72,60,"I'm not a doctor, but I'm pretty sure you could make jokes about it. It is misleading and misleading. I read the article. The article is misleading and misleading."
74,60,"I think the joke that's being made is essentially that someone has to wear a mask, and because they have not done it it's not good. Hopefully the implication of the joke will stick."
79,60,>It's not a prank. They've gone to extreme lengths for a while to be in a sense.
83,60,"I can't speak for the other one, but the NRA is just a non-existent group of people."
94,60,There is a huge problem in that Vaccination isn't a joke. The FDA is trying to stop this and they aren't going to make them do anything about it.
99,60,"""Vaccination is an important part of protecting people from a deadly virus."
60,4,>We've gone to extreme lengths for a while to be in a sense.
60,15,[Assembled by a CDC official](http://www.cdc.gov/content/agm/agm/agm-joke) is the best joke of all time.

60,22,I am a nasa user.
60,27,"If you want a joke, it's a joke."
60,31,It's a joke. This is a good joke.
60,32,I'm pretty sure it was the AMA that caused the most confusion in the thread.
60,33,"I'm not saying that's a joke, but I'm saying that the CDC isn't going to change if they do. They do have a mandate to ban masks. But it doesn't mean they don't have a mandate."
60,40,"It's a joke, it's a joke."
60,43,Because he is the one who would laugh so hard and then just get in his raccoon costume.
60,44,"The NRA, a non-existent group of people, is not one of the most respected bodies in the world."
60,55,A lot of people have the fear of the CDC saying that it's a joke because it's being used as a safety precaution against the spread of the disease and skunk is a joke that they can't be bothered to try and pull off.
63,60,Vaccination is not a joke.
68,60,"I thought it was funny, but I wasn't quite sure why it didn't make sense to the point of being so critical. I guess you're right."
72,60,I don't think it's funny.
74,60,"I am a little rusty, but my friend, when he was working at TWitchCon, he said:"
79,60,So you are going to say the joke is wrong? It's wrong. The CDC is making fun of skunks. Isn't that just a joke? It's just not a joke. They're doing it for fun.

60,15,The best joke of all time was made when the NRA started shitstorming about it and they got very concerned about how they were going to be skeptics. They were making a joke about a sick guy. They just hated it.
60,16,A good one. You have to get over the fact that a lot of the jokes that the NRA is making seem so funny. Its a joke.

60,31,I just want to ask what the problem is with your view on the question. I don't have a choice. I'm trying to make an AMA out of that nonsense.
60,32,"Vaccines aren't even legal anymore. They're not going to help with the spread of the virus.',"
60,33,This is a good joke. This is one of the most entertaining jokes of all time.
60,40,A good one isn't a joke. A bad one is a joke.
60,43,The joke is a joke about the fact that the government is taking measures that help prevent the spread of a virus. This is a joke because people are using a joke to do it to avoid contamination of others.
60,44,The joke is a bit much to make fun of.
60,55,I am a psych specialist and a doctor.

79,60,I have nothing to do with this topic.
83,60,"As a former NRA coach, I can say with absolute certainty that it's not a joke, but that the AMA was about a legitimate problem that the president did not want to solve. I'm not saying that it's not a joke. I'm saying that it isn't really about the issue and its not legal in my state."
94,60,Vaccination isn't a joke. It is a joke because it's the government's job to prevent the spread of the virus.
99,60,"I'm not sure how I understand the question but a lot of people just don't like it anymore. As a woman and a doctor, I wouldn't get vaccinated.

60,32,The NRA is trying to push for a reversal of its decision.
60,33,They are trying to make a new AMA for the new president.
60,40,It's a joke because that would be the whole point of a joke.
60,43,I think we're all doing it wrong. It's so obvious a joke is not a joke. I don't think it's about the ACA. It's about the fact that the government isn't willing to take measures to stop the spread of a virus.
60,44,The first part of the article is that this is the joke.
60,55,The CDC has made it so that the AMA is much more accurate and meaningful.

60,40,I'm sure that the CDC is not really a joke. I don't think the AMA is about the vaccine as much as the AMA about a skunk mask. It's about the 'honey-moon' joke about a viral disease.Vaccination is illegal in the US.

94,60,"This isn't a joke. It's a joke because they make jokes. They're a joke.

72,60,>The article is the worst of all the idiots in the world. I am a fan of the US. I am a fan of the NRA.
74,60,"A lot of people here are trying to defend the government. It is absurd that people wouldn't use hats as a joke because it would be like ""it's a joke, but it seems like a joke about the government."" It's like the administration is a prick and it seems so ridiculous."

83,60,"My guess is that because he's not a federal official, he doesn't know the entire thing."

99,60,"I don't think you know the definition of ""Joke"" to start with."
60,4,The headline on [https://www.reddit.com/r/academics/en-landlord_historia](https://www.reddit.com/r/academics/en-landlord_historia) (https://www.reddit.com/r/academics/en-landlord_historia) is just a joke.
60,15,The article is the worst of all the idiots in the world.
60,16,This is a joke - they are trying to use the CDC to try and cut down on the spread of the virus. Vaccines aren't legally allowed anymore. They aren't going to help combat the spread of the virus.
60,22,"CANNOTANSWER OP, 'CanNOTANSWER OP', 'CanNOTANSWER OP', 'CanNOTANSWER OP', 'CanNOTANSWER OP', 'It is a joke. It is a joke.'"
60,27,"I think the article is not a joke, it is a joke. The article is a joke."
60,31,"""I want to make an AMA out of that nonsense."
60,32,"Well, it's not really a joke, and if a law firm does say that, it will be making headlines."
60,33,There are two things that the NRA has done that I think are funny.
60,40,"As much as the CDC is trying to make a joke about it, this is an attempt to make the US government seem less prickish and less assholeish."
60,43,This is a joke about the ACA.
60,44,I believe it is a prank. But I think they are just going to have to use it as an excuse for their inhumane behavior.
60,55,"I've never heard of this phrase before.... the whole point of the AMA is that you can do anything for fun, and that you can't be bothered to think about it."
63,60,The joke is about a joke. It's a joke.
68,60,The AMA isn't a joke and the article is a joke.
72,60,Why should I use this article?
74,60,"It's also about the fact that you are from Georgia, and you don't have to wear a mask to watch TWitchCon."
79,60,So OP is complaining to a joke. He is referring to a prank that is done by the CDC as 'the ACA is a prank' because it's about the government. The problem is not the CDC.
83,60,A former NRA coach says he is a fan of the sport and the fact he hasn't heard about the issue of it since his last one despite him doing something like this before. It's a bit sad for him that the government wants to get rid of this nonsense.

99,60,"They want it to be illegal in California, in many states, but not only that, but the government has to take this to court."
60,4,I'm going to assume that the article is the worst of all the idiots in the world. I think this article is just a joke. The article is the worst of all the idiots in the world.
60,15,"It is an attempt to make the US government seem less prickish and less assholeish. They want it to be illegal in California, in many states, but not only that, but the government has to take this to court."
60,16,"I can tell you that I’m not that much of a liberal as a dick about this joke, but it’s just a joke."
60,22,"""What the law says is not a joke."""
60,27,Vaccination is an issue. You don't have to wear a mask to get it to work. The whole point of a prank is to cut down on the spread of the disease.
60,31,People are trying to get the CDC to stop it.
60,32,A man has a new job. He's a lawyer. He's a lawyer.
60,33,"I'm not a doctor, but I was sick for 5 years before the vaccine was approved."
60,40,"It's called the CDC joke (that it's the government's job to prevent the spread of the virus). You can't really call it a joke, but a joke in which the CDC is putting a mask on people and making it look like a joke is just a joke."
60,43,You're saying that the ACA is a joke? You are absolutely correct. It's a prank. This is about the federal government in a way that would be a very bad joke and a good one to pass a law. The article is a joke because they are trying to use the CDC to help fight the spread of the virus.
60,44,A prank on the NRA is a joke. It's not just that it's a joke. It's that it's a joke.
60,55,I'm from Utah. I don't want to be the next king of the health department.
63,60,I have a good laugh.
68,60,"I like the movie and I like it a lot. I mean, it does make sense, but it's not funny. I'm sorry but I don't think it's funny. I'm just saying the fact that he says it's funny that the guy is wearing a mask to protect himself would have a negative impact on the health of the person who's wearing a mask."
72,60,"IANAL: I've seen these articles and they're all terrible, I'm just not sure what to believe from a quote. Why should I use this article?"
74,60,"The president is a scumbag, the joke is real, but not an easy one."
79,60,"Yes, it's illegal to use a mask. It's illegal to use a mask for a joke, and it's illegal for an act that is anti-government if it's on the law, which is a joke."
83,60,The AMA is about what was a joke.
94,60,"The phrase ""I don't wear a mask, I do not wear a mask."" sounds similar to ""I wear a mask every day to protect myself."
99,60,I have a huge list of all the jokes about the government being trying to make this illegal.
60,4,I think this is an interesting article about the president.
60,15,"If you're going to play the jokes on the ACA, you're going to have to re-read the whole thing."
60,16,Vaccines aren't legally allowed anymore. Vaccines aren't even legal anymore. They're not going to help combat the spread of the virus. The only problem is the article.
60,22,He's describing how he was supposed to get the AMA for the ACA but didn't have the money to do it.
60,27,"I mean, I think they're trying to make it easier for people to see what the joke is about."
60,31,I believe the article in question has an interesting twist:
60,32,"CANNOTANSWER: "" I am not a lawyer, but I have to make jokes about the skunks and the government. I am more of a liberal. I am a lawyer."
60,33,A lot of people are making fun of the government because they think they're a joke.
60,40,It was a joke. You were a victim of the mask. This is not a joke.
60,43,I'm a lawyer and I work with people on these issues. We can talk about this in a lot of ways and they're both quite ridiculous.
60,44,It's a joke. It is a joke. It is a joke. It is a joke. The joke isn't even funny because of the fact that it is a joke.
60,55,"I'm a doctor who was a doctor, and I wear a mask to protect my family. It's not a joke. I'm a medical professor."
63,60,"I read a very similar story, only in Spanish. I guessed you were talking about the CDC. But in the context that is an excellent example of the joke."
68,60,"You're being ridiculous, and the headlines say you're being hilarious."
72,60,"I'm not a doctor, but I think that the AMA is the most ridiculous joke ever."
74,60,"Vaccines are not legally legal anymore. They're only illegal in certain countries (twitch, wtf, syria), and they're not enforceable. The joke is about the government and you could just go to a party."
79,60,"I'd like to tell you that this isn't a prank, but that's the only prank that's actually a joke and that's pretty much what this is."
83,60,The AMA is about what was a joke.
94,60,It's a joke and it's not necessary. The CDC is trying to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS.
99,60,"Vaccination is illegal in many states, but not only that, but the government has to take this to court to prevent this."
60,4,The article is being manipulated by the CDC and not the people who are the ones making it. They are in the wrong. They have no say in what their policy on the matter is and the article makes no use of what their policies are. Those are the ones that are being manipulated by the government.
60,15,So the best part of the AMA is that I'm not a lawyer.
60,16,The joke isn't a joke. The joke is. It's a joke.
60,22,"Vaccines aren't legal anymore. They're only illegal in some states (twitch, wtf, syria), and they're not enforceable. The joke is about what was a joke."
60,27,> It's a joke because the CDC and their cdc are the ones who need to keep up with the joke.
60,31,"""Cannons"" are referred to as ""people who care about the safety of other people while talking about their health."
60,32,I think the joke is being blatantly misleading.
60,33,"It sounds like a joke, not a joke. It sounds like the CDC wants to bring the ACA to a standstill."
60,40,People often take the joke as a way to make their job seem like they have a valid job. They're trying to make it seem like they have a valid job.
60,43,It's a joke. The ACA was a joke. It's a joke.
60,44,The only part of the article that doesn't get used is the fact that the article is about a joke about the government.
60,55,"CANNOTANSWER: (sorry, it's a misquote), ie. The article is about the CDC, a joke aimed at preventing the spread of a virus."
63,60,"In this case, I wouldn't be getting the joke. Vaccination is an important part of the vaccination program in the US. It was introduced to people who re-explain the effects of HIV in their community, like doctors, nurses, doctors and nurses. Vaccination is a major part of that. You're being sarcastic."
68,60,This isn't the new thing and isn't about the actual news. It's about how the government is working on it. Whether or not they're actually making the joke is irrelevant.
72,60,"A skunk, a lone skunk, the skunk, a lone skunk."
74,60,TIL that the president and the government are not going to help with the spread. The apocalypse is not actually over. They are not going to help stop the spread.
79,60,"I'm not saying that people should be encouraged to use a mask, but the idea of using a mask is a joke. It's a joke."
83,60,"""The entire AMA is a joke. It's about the government helping the spread of a virus."""
94,60,The entire thing is a joke because it is a joke about a joke about being a doctor. It's a joke because it's a joke because it's the government's job to prevent the spread of the virus.
99,60,"“I don’t like wearing my mask. I’m sorry if this makes me so uncomfortable but I’ll never get a child to come in contact with me. My friends are trying to find an alternative. The problem is, my children don’t want to be put in contact with me. I’m trying to make this problem better,” he said."
60,4,It's a joke. But it's not a joke because it is a joke. It's just a joke.
60,15,I think you are the best person on this thread. The AMA was about people who wanted to know what the virus was.
60,16,He's not going to get the joke.
60,22,I don't think the joke is funny - it's a joke - it's a joke - it's a joke - it's not funny - it's a joke - a joke - it's a joke - it's a joke - it's a joke - and not a joke - it's not a joke - it's a joke - it's a joke - a joke.
60,27,"In this case, I would just leave."
60,31,"Vaccines aren't illegal anymore. They're only illegal in some states, and the AMA is a joke."
60,32,Vaccines aren’t legal anymore. They’re not going to stop the spread of a virus. Vaccination is an important part of the vaccination program in the US. It’s a joke because it’s about the government helping the spread of the virus.
60,33,"I don't even care what the word'skunk' means, because I'm sick of having sex with a skunk"
60,40,This is a joke about the government and its policies. The article says it's not a joke. It's about how the CDC is trying to stop the spread of a virus.
60,43,A prank like this can be an extremely dangerous joke to people in need.
60,44,Why are people trying to stop the government from making a joke about the government?
60,55,"""... the whole point of a mask is a joke."
63,60,>I think the whole point of being a joke is that it makes people uncomfortable.
68,60,AMA with [Scott] C. A. Johnson is a very good piece. They're trying to use the movie to show that the AMA isn't about the NSA.
72,60,"""A skunk, a lone skunk, the skunk, a lone skunk."
74,60,I’ve made the same mistake with hats in a lot of situations:
79,60,The jokes are making fun of people who are not citizens of the United States. There is a reason why that shit is getting aired on news.
83,60,"OP, I have never heard this on the radio but that is what I always hear."
94,60,It's a joke because of the fact that you have a big nutcase or a guy who says he is a joke but not a joke. 'I wear a mask every day in the case of a virus. The whole thing is a joke because it's a joke because the government does not have to use it for public health. It's a joke because it's the government's job to prevent the spread of a virus. It is a joke because people aren't comfortable with it.
99,60,"""...I can understand the joke but I think if you're going to get a joke like this, it's too dangerous to wear a mask - it's also dangerous to have a mask on. I feel like the CDC is going to have to go out of their way to give people the vaccine unless they want the people to get sick, and it has the potential to actually save a bunch of lives. It is a very important part of the government's policy. They are trying to make it illegal in California, but not only that, but also to"
60,4,It is illegal in the US for everyone to wear a mask and in the US to be in the vaccine.
60,15,"The AMA was about HIV/AIDS, not HIV/AIDS. The AMA is about the CDC trying to make it illegal and the AMA is about a joke about the AMA."
60,16,I would get over it as quickly as possible.
60,22,"I think that the whole point of being a joke is that it makes people uncomfortable. The article says 'It's a joke because it's a joke because it's the government's job to prevent the spread of a virus.', 'It's a joke because it's the government's job to prevent the spread of a virus."

60,32,The movie doesn't really give a good understanding of a 'judgement of the whole joke'. It does give the idea of a joke to be funny and you would have to give it to the person who has a bad day.
60,33,"I think the article is a very good piece, but the people trying to show this joke to me are a bit of an asshole."
60,40,It’s all a joke because people are trying to make it seem like they have a valid job. It’s also a joke because it’s not funny to say.
60,43,"i'm not a lawyer, but i'm also a lawyer."
60,44,The AMA is not about the government. It is about the NRA and their AMA with C. A. Johnson.
60,55,"""... I feel like the whole point of a mask is that it makes people uncomfortable."""
63,60,"I'm not a doctor. I'm in medicine. I want to make a joke about this, but I am not a doctor. I can't go to a doctor because a lot of the people who are in the medical field use masks, and I do it to help."
68,60,"It's not about the issue itself, it's about how they want to address the issue. This article doesn't mention the issue, but is basically what's being called 'no jokes'. The article isn't about the actual issues - it's about how the government is working on it. The whole thing isn't about the actual news, it's about how the government is working on it. They are making it about how the government is working on it."

79,60,I have a good feeling that this is just a prank and the president is trying to bring some sort of morality to the conversation.
83,60,As a former NRA member and a pro football coach I can confirm that I agree with a lot of things here and i would just rather it be a joke.
94,60,So you're saying that wearing a mask is a joke and not a joke?
99,60,"I like how they've pushed this through so hard, and they're not even trying."
60,4,AMA is being manipulated by the CDC and they don't have a say in what the policy is on. It is about the government helping to stop the spread of the virus.

60,27,Vaccines are not a joke. It's a joke because they're being designed by a government to prevent the spread of a disease.
60,31,I know people who wear a mask but they do it to protect themselves and people. The joke is that they don't want people sick with HIV or HIV/AIDS.
60,32,"I have a feeling that the joke is a joke about what is on the AMA, and that there is an audience of people who may not understand it."
60,33,I think this is one of the best jokes of all time.
60,40,It isn't really a joke.
60,43,So why are you referring to the government's job and the AMA?
60,44,"I think they've really got something wrong with it, it's just that it's a joke and it's not funny because they want to stop spreading a virus"
60,55,It was a joke and the president did not attempt to make the joke. The article was about how the government is working on this. The article is about how the government wants to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS.

60,22,There is a joke about why he has a mask when he goes to get a vaccine. It is a joke.

60,16,The only time I've seen a joke in the article is when I saw an AMA a few weeks ago about a hunch and the joke being the joke.
60,22,I have never felt like talking about a joke to my friends or anyone. They don't want to make fun of something or do something they know is wrong. They don't want to make fun of what they know.

60,16,"I'd be very annoyed at the fact that you're just saying that if it were just a joke, it's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke."
60,22,AMA with Scott is a prank and it's basically a joke and I'm not a conservative either.

79,60,"Why don't they just go around talking to the other side, and if we want to get all that in front of people?"
83,60,"The AMA was about the ACA - ""so the president's got a skunk mask and Obama is the president."""
94,60,So what does a person who's already in the world need to do for his or her own safety and health?
99,60,"As a doctor I agree with the joke. But I do think the government has a right to regulate things and to protect people. I agree with you on everything, but if there is one thing I agree with you on, I believe a joke is a joke."
60,4,"Yes, this is a joke."
60,15,"A great part of the AMA is that the topic isn't about the virus itself, but what it's about. The whole idea that there's a potential danger is based on the fact that there's a lot of shit going on. The headline is a joke that can only be used by people who aren't nihilism. If you like it, you should have a good time!"
60,16,The AMA with Scott and the other questions on Vaccination and the CDC were about a taser a bit to the point of the AMA making it sound like a joke. There's no reason not to wear a mask if you're sick or not infected.
60,22,This is a joke and is not a joke. It isn't a joke.
60,27,"I think the joke is the fact that it is an issue that is very, very relevant, and a funny one to be on, even though it is a joke."

60,40,The story is about a guy getting a dang mask and a skunk that isn't even in the picture (although he was fucking infected).
60,43,I think it's a joke that the government will be taking measures to stop the spread of a virus and this is a joke.
60,44,I think the AMA's are really interesting to me. It's also interesting to me that a lot of medical professionals are very uncomfortable about the concept of a mask in public. Some of those people have been trying to keep the government from letting it bother them for years. The only reason the article was written was because people are not joking around in front of people. I think this article is pretty funny. I think the story is really interesting and I think the article has the most credibility and relevance among medical professionals. It's also very interesting to learn some of the authors who work with people
60,55,AMA with Scott is just a joke.
63,60,Vaccination is a joke because it prevents the spread of the virus.
68,60,"""The AMA is really good. if he didn't get vaccinated he would be banned."""
72,60,That's the whole point of this AMA and not what it was intended to be. It's really not a joke. The jokes are about the government's role in stopping the spread of a virus.
74,60,It's also crazy that people are saying the CDC is a prick and it seems so ridiculous.
79,60,Vaccination is a joke. It is a joke.
83,60,The AMA is a comedy. It's a real comedy and a joke.
94,60,It isn't a joke because it's a joke.

60,4,There isn't much of a difference between wearing a mask in the morning and a mask in the afternoon.
60,15,This AMA was about the actual facts.
60,16,I don't think a joke is a joke.
60,22,"That's really funny, but the joke is really funny."
60,27,If the CDC is trying to make a joke about it it's not going to work.
60,31,"The story of him saying the AMA with Scott is ""I think it's a joke."""
60,32,In the context of the article I'm sure there's a lot of truth behind that.
60,33,"I've been a CDC staffer for about two years. I've always wondered what a mask is, but the first one is so stupid and obnoxious. I'm not sure how many jokes these people have made, but they are a lot. The second one is pretty fun and it's funny because people seem to think the CDC's policy is good."
60,40,Because I don't like it.

63,60,"A bit cliche, but it doesn't sound like he wants to get sick. He's telling an awful joke about that, and he thinks the CDC should be a troll."
68,60,The whole thing doesn't make sense - it's about how the government is working on it - and it doesn't make sense.
72,60,The AMA was not a joke. It is misleading and misleading. It is misleading and misleading. I read the article.
74,60,"As a fellow American, I'm confused by all the other comments that are relevant here."
79,60,"I'm not a lawyer, but I can tell you that this is a good joke. The only thing that makes me uncomfortable about it is being able to wear a mask outside of a vehicle."
83,60,"I've had a few similar AMA's with coaches, but they aren't really a great AMA. It's about a real joke."
94,60,"You say that because of the fact that a guy who says he's a big fan of hockey is a joke, that it is not a joke because the CDC is trying to get people to take it back and stop it."
99,60,"Vaccination isn't really a joke, but rather an important part of the policy. It's the part of the government that wants to prevent the spread of a deadly disease."
60,4,It's like a joke where a liar tells you that she's infected with a virus and wants to put on a mask while the rest of the people are sick?
60,15,"What a joke! The AMA was about the virus and not the government. The AMA is about the public health, not the CDC."
60,16,This is the first time I've heard someone in my state in this context do anything about the joke that makes me uncomfortable.
60,22,AMA: There is a joke
60,27,"I don't understand what that joke is, but it does make sense. Vaccination isn't a joke because it's designed by the government to stop the spread of a virus."
60,31,"No, it's a joke. It's the ''most important part'' of a public health policy and if it was a joke, then it'd probably be a joke. But what the AMA says is, it's not going to help with any of the facts or the actual facts."
60,32,"There is a lot of truth behind the AMA, and you can have a discussion with your lawyer and the lawyer, and say if they say something like this, they'll be happy to go with the joke and you'll not have to have a joke with their lawyer. Whether or not that joke is a joke is not really the question and we'll be concerned. We can have a discussion with you and the lawyer and not just the lawyer."
60,33,There are two sides to the story.
60,40,i was trying to see if you have a legitimate opinion about the whole issue.
60,43,"People say that because people get sick from wearing masks and getting infected, they can't get AIDS from a mask. There's no chance that they will get it because they know the virus is a joke. The fact that it's an attempt to smear the government is a joke."
60,44,It's not a joke to make fun of. It's a joke.
60,55,"The article, although in a way satire, is obnoxious."
63,60,It's not a joke. Vaccination is part of the ACA.
68,60,The joke about the government's working on it is about how it swayed a whole country and in the US.
72,60,This is about sarcasm. You're right that is not the kind of thing you're looking for.
74,60,The government has been doing the best they can to prevent the spread of the disease.
79,60,"So, ""Poor people who wear a mask outside of a vehicle are very likely to get sick. So, to make it a good joke, you have to wear one."""
83,60,"I don't understand why you are being downvoted for this. Surely it's not only a joke, but also a joke."
94,60,What if your patient is in a clinical trial and your mask is not on the CDC's team?
99,60,"Vaccination is a great way to end peoples illnesses, but unfortunately it's a ridiculous thing to do. If it's a joke, it's no joke."
60,4,It's funny because the government isn't in charge of the virus.

60,16,"I don't know if you're familiar with the article. I know in California, I see it as part of the ACA. What's the joke about?"
60,22,It is a joke. It is a joke.
60,27,"As a woman, I would not wear a mask at any time of the day."

60,32,It's about preventing the spread of AIDS.
60,33,"CANNOTANSWER: People say that because people get sick from wearing a mask and getting infected, they can't get AIDS from a mask."
60,40,"People with HIV tend to think the ACA is a joke and have a joke about it. Despite claiming it is a joke, this is not a joke. I don't get how that is funny."
60,43,"No one wants to know why the person is being downvoted for this. They don't know what the joke is. They think it's a joke. They don't have any idea how to make people think they are being downvoted. They are getting a bad joke, but it doesn't matter. I wouldn't be offended if there was a joke about this, it's a joke about the ACA, and I don't know where it ends in."
60,44,No one was making fun of the Obama AMA. No one was joking about it.
