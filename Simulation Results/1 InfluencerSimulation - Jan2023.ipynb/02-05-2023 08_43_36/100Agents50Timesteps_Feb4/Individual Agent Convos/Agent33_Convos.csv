60,33,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I don't understand why people aren't aware that wearing a mask is not to reduce the spread of the virus. That's a good question to ask for clarification.

95,33,I see a lot of humor in this article.
99,33,"They have mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters. Because it makes people less prone to contract and vaccinating.

33,8,I am very confused by the post. The reason why I am not able to have a crowbar in the first place is because I hate that I can't wear it. It has nothing to do with how to carry a virus around.
43,33,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.That sounds like a really terrible movie. I am sure the CDC has found a very good source to make that up.

79,33,"The difference isn't that it's not mandatory, but that it's not a mandate to protect people."
85,33,Yes. In a sarcastic way. But the point was that he is being a complete idiot. I think the U.S. government is essentially trying to stop the spread of the virus. There are many things we do that the US government can't do.

You're telling them that this is a bad idea but they don't have a mask. They are being criticized and abused by the media. It's not about the masks, it's about the people.

43,33,"The ACA is being enacted. It's an old rule that people in our country have to be trained to eat, drink, and eat to prevent spread of virus."

That's why I don't think they care enough to start talking to the CDC and get the CDC to work, which makes it harder to get them on the same page. They're too lazy to do that and not really interested in getting vaccines because they're too stupid to do it."
52,33,I really think that there are many examples of those.
53,33,This is a very interesting sub. The first paragraph sounds really sexist and insulting. I think you're missing something.
55,33,Wearing a mask to prevent a virus will definitely make you sick.

33,2,"People are intolerant, too. They are not going to get better by simply being a little more open to them. They aren't going to get better by wearing masks. There is no way to stop a virus, they will not get better by getting the disease out. It is an important fact of life that a person is allowed to have. If you're like my dad, you will not do that."

92,33,But I think it's wrong to feel like this is one of the many good things you can do to help prevent this problem from spreading. You need to ask your local officials to remove the government from your country and make it clear that the government is making the best use of this tool.
95,33,"I'm Canadian. I'm a fan of the ""Wearing a mask outside or in my car alone"" comment."

47,33,Vaccines are not really a great idea. The only thing that really seems to work in this thread is how we make things a little easier and less dangerous. And why wouldn't we be doing the same thing? Vaccines are not really an alternative. They’re just used to people with serious health problems. A good deal of people don’t have a choice.
52,33,I was just going to say that I'm just a little annoyed that it's just one thing and it's not the other way around. That this is not going to be a good article but I find it interesting how these folks think that the government is trying to influence the public in order to make things better. It's also about a big part of why they don't want to do anything that they actually need to do.
53,33,This is why so many people are fucking hate him. I’m actually from Georgia. I hate to think the president is going to turn himself in on a mask because it would make people look terrible.

55,33,"I think the people who are trying to say ""what do you want"" to the EPA and CDC are using the word 'terrorist' in their statement."
60,33,The CDC is basically being an asshole for calling it a joke.
65,33,"This scumbag is probably doing a great job of explaining why people aren't wearing a mask, because you think that being able to prevent the spread of a virus is a joke?"
70,33,Why isn't the team getting in the same place when he's not wearing a mask?
79,33,"The only way to get rid of a joke is to just not make it. It makes it easier for you to see that people are clinging to their racist agenda. And that's a petty joke, huh?"
85,33,'We don't have to wear a mask'
92,33,I think the point is that the President is being a bit smug.

99,33,"I don't even know what it's about, but there's a lot of really interesting and interesting points in it. You're right that the government is a joke, but what they're trying to force is not that big of a deal to them. The problem isn't whether it's the media or the government's fault, it's that it's a shithole to deny it's true, and if you want to be polite, the CDC doesn't have a problem with it."
101,33,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
33,2,"... I think the people who are trying to say ""what do you want"" to the EPA and CDC are using the word ""terrorist"" in their statement."
33,8,It's all that's really going on in the article.
43,33,oh boy yep. it's a prank and not a joke.
47,33,"I'm assuming that a lot of people are not interested in the vaccinations being given out as it's an obvious, generalization thing?"
52,33,>This is not the only article in this series. I'm going to ask you if you have any other questions. The CDC needs to take the issue with him and make it known to the public he was a prick.
53,33,"Then, if you like it, you're not going to like it."
55,33,"It was funny when I saw the guy who's wearing the mask and he said, ""That's the best part of a mask. I don't know what to say about the whole thing."""
60,33,"I like to think if the government is helping the spread of the virus, then it's better to get a new mask to prevent it from spreading. This seems to be the underlying theme that most people see the way they think. It's that the government uses things that are more appropriate to the person than they do to prevent their health from being infected and that this is the only way to help the public."
65,33,"The US Government is just a jerk. They are supposed to help. They don't have a mandate for prevention. If they don't, they don't have the money to do it."
70,33,"I think the fact that he's wearing it properly under a helmet is a great sign of him having a career, he deserves it and I love him."
79,33,"I don't get how people like these articles, and I'm surprised they didn't include the ones about the health care act that prevents people from getting sick from their mask. They are all really good jokes, even when they are petty, like I'm trying to tell them I hate them, and I can't take them, I just don't get how they're being funny."
85,33,"Well, there's some stuff a hive mind could have done. They've been doing a lot of good in this area, but I think this is a lot of things to do to protect the people of the U.S."
92,33,>The joke is...I don”t have a job for EPA. They just do it in response to a threat of something serious.
95,33,You mean to put on a mask outside of your car?
99,33,""" I don't understand what people say a lot of people don't understand."""
101,33,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
33,2,I'm sorry to hear you aren't following your stance.
33,8,"They did the wrong thing with his face. They're not trying to protect us. They're putting on a mask, as in an eye guard, and not even putting on a crowbar. The only thing that will stop it from spreading is the people who have no idea how to work a full time job because of them."
43,33,"It seems like the ACA is being enacted. It's an old rule that people in our country have to be trained to eat, drink, and eat to prevent the spread of a virus."
47,33,The CDC is the government's cause of action in the fight against a disease.
52,33,"CANNOTANSWER: We are going to start an ACA campaign and put a skunk mask on the public. We are going to need a better plan, and they will."
53,33,It's a joke he is trying to deceive the people who question him. I can't help you with anything but what you said.
55,33,"CANNOTANSWER: Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I think you need to read up on the use of the word ""terrorist."""
60,33,They don't know what the CDC is. I know a guy who wears a mask when he can't leave office. I haven't really asked him what the problem is with a mask. It sounds like the joke is pretty funny.
65,33,"This is a great idea, OP."
70,33,"if he's not wearing a mask it's a sign of the lack of a sense of humor, a sense of humor, a sense of humor, and a feeling of respect for his team."
79,33,"I think you've already made the first statement (that you're not on r/reddit if you're reading the other comments), but don't seem to be able to explain how you're feeling. I guess you're probably thinking of the phrase ""Assassin,"" which means you're talking about people who don't even like the government, but aren't actually against the government. And it's not just about the government."
85,33,He could get a new mask. But he can't. There isn't a reason for it.
92,33,The Obama Administration has done a great job of letting people know that their government is over thinking their security programs. I'm so proud of you.
95,33,"IANAL: I’ve been there, done that a few times, and have seen people saying, “I don’t know what the word virus”..."
99,33,What does the CDC have to do with the people who aren't vaccinated?
101,33,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
33,2,"It's called ""a joke."" It's a joke he's trying to deceive the people who question him."
33,8,"There is no reason to wear a mask. I'm a woman. I haven't been in a medical environment for 20 years, so I don't think it's a great idea. It's a great idea."
43,33,They are attempting to make people who aren't going to help. That's a good idea.
47,33,"I've read a few more comments, but I never found one of them so interesting."
52,33,A man in the military is expected to wear a mask for public health. It's not a medical necessity or the ability to protect the human body.
53,33,I'm not trying to be funny. It's the one thing I don't like to talk about in general.
55,33,What’s the best part of a mask?
60,33,This joke makes me cringe more than I'd be if I were to make a joke about the government.
65,33,This sub isn't a joke. The entire article is just a joke about people thinking it is a joke.

It makes it easier for you to see that people are against the government."
85,33,Vaccination is not required for everybody unless the person is in an advanced stage of a clinical trial.
92,33,It is the EPA. EPA is a state agency. The EPA is not.
95,33,"The idiom is just a joke. The phrase 'If you wear a mask outside or in your car alone is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. This is funny, and not very funny. I am from the US and I'm a fan of the ""Wearing a mask outside or in my car alone"" joke. ""Wow, a lot of the government's behavior is aimed at me."
99,33,It's a joke. But it's not. It's a joke.

43,33,>The whole point of a mask is to not wear it. It's to stop the spread of a virus.
47,33,I think I've heard enough about it that this could be an interesting question to ask your mom - or a doctor. I've seen a few videos of a couple different people being vaccinated with different types of viruses and they were surprised.
52,33,A man in the military is expected to wear a mask to protect the human body. It's not a medical necessity or the ability to protect the human body.
53,33,CANNOTANSWER:
55,33,The CDC is not using the word terrorist as a valid excuse to ignore the people they are responsible for. They are using a petty joke as an excuse to ignore the people they are responsible for.
60,33,CDC's goal is to prevent people from spreading the virus and the other problems they've identified with people a lot more often.
65,33,It's not a joke.
70,33,"I'm not sure how to explain it, but they're talking about a team that was tagged as the 'Famous Sportsman'."
79,33,The entire point of the joke is to show the lack of actual information that is needed to explain it. It's not really a prank.
85,33,"CANNOTANSWER: ""The CDC has already found a source to make it up a few times and that is pretty funny. Its an option and a good reason to not buy it."
92,33,"It's one of the reasons the Trump administration is shaming EPA, the same as the Bush administration."
95,33,I'm trying to keep it as simple as possible:
99,33,"It seems like the CDC is trying to force the people to get vaccinated, rather than the government."
101,33,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."

43,33,"AMA, but with a different subtitle, in a different language."
47,33,I’m an asshole.
52,33,That's the main point of the article that the Obama administration is trying to make.
53,33,>I’m going to get to my daughters party today and tell them that we shouldn’t be doing something like that. Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of a virus. I think the issue is that the AMA is about what the people need to do to prevent this problem. I’m going to get to my daughters party today and tell them that we shouldn’t be doing something like that.
55,33,i read it as a joke and it sounded pretty much the same as I was trying to say
60,33,The article says it was written by [NAME] who's a doctor who's been sick for 5 years and is no longer a doctor.
65,33,That scumbag is clearly a jerk.
70,33,So a guy wearing a mask wearing a mask when he is on the field is wearing a mask? That sounds like an excellent joke. You say that because he does not shave and so does everyone else and that his face is fucked? So what are you talking about?
79,33,"In your comment, ""I am an anti-government skunk, and I think it's funny because I like it. I would wear a mask outside of a vehicle, but I don't want to take it out of my ear."""
85,33,>I hope he isn't using it as an excuse to ignore the people he is responsible for. They're using the ACA as an excuse to ignore the people they are responsible for.
92,33,"EPA is part of the government's problem. There is a huge difference between the EPA and the Bush administration, and the President is acting on it and calling it a ""bad joke"". This doesn't mean the government is wrong. The EPA is overthinking its security programs, and it is, in fact, not the EPA."
95,33,"'""The only way we can stop the spread of a virus."
99,33,"I would be angry about someone saying something like this, and it would be so much easier for me to put on a mask."
101,33,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
33,2,"I'm not a doctor but a doctor who had a job in a healthcare company. He said that he would have a job at a hospital and would have no problem wearing a mask because of his'sex'. He said the EPA is shaming the CDC, while he's still being a doctor. He's trying to keep it simple, but he's just not comfortable with a mask."
33,8,I think the only thing that will stop the spread of a virus is the people who have no idea how to work a full time job because of them.
43,33,Is there a reason they erect a mask in the US?
47,33,I think it's an interesting story and a joke that makes you think Trump is a sexist racist.
52,33,And then they'll end up buying it for a million bucks. You should get the guy a mask asap.
53,33,"I can’t read the article, because I can’t read the article, but it sounds very unpopular."
55,33,I’m also a sports fan.
60,33,A doctor who wasn't an expert on HIV and you can't see where the question comes from.
65,33,I'm glad the U.S. has stopped using this shit in their efforts to prevent the spread of a virus.
70,33,You are probably right. I don't think he should be fired for wearing a mask.
79,33,"And then it is the CDC, which doesn't know the meaning of 'petty joke'. They're doing it so they get something to laugh about."
85,33,"The hive mind and the maskn't really a joke in my opinion, but the ACAn't like the guy at all. That's an outrageous point of view that I think is a fair stance. You are right the maskn't for everyone, but the mask is."
92,33,You're being a dick. The government has no responsibility for the world.
95,33,"IANAL is not a funny person, and I don't understand the difference between a ""I don't know what the word virus"" and a ""I don't know what the word virus"" joke. This is a joke, which is not a joke, and I think that it's the right thing to do."

101,33,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."

33,8,"In the US, the President and his friends are nymphotypically a bit of a troll, so I can't see that. It's hard to find a job."
43,33,As someone who worked at a medical school that used to do the same thing.
47,33,"In this context, I think that Trump's racist stance on 'Waying a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government' is just an irrational ploy to make the American people feel better about themselves. Is that right?"
52,33,In some ways it's a prank.
53,33,"I don't like it, but I know that's a joke. And he said it on purpose, he hasn't been using it."
55,33,People should never knowingly commit this kind of behavior to an innocent and innocent person.
60,33,ahh the government is being cruel. you're so ignorant about HIV that you're actually putting off getting an AMA because you don't know what it is about?

65,33,It's not a joke. It's a joke. The CDC and the CDC don't know how to deal with it. The CDC is doing great things with it.
70,33,The joke isn't about racists. It's about people being stupid and making jokes about things they don't like. The post is about how a mask is a joke about a joke about a president.
