96,94,"He's in a game. He's the MVP, he's the backup quarterback. He gets the huddle on the team. But the goal is to get all the teams in. He's in it. But I think it's time to start getting his head in the game, rather than just the face on the field."

94,9,"The point is that the government is doing their research, which is what the article states, and is a joke for the sake of the point. It is a joke for a reason. But a joke is an opportunity to do it."
94,17,There is a very real difference between a mask and a vaccine.
94,26,"It's in the same sub. It has something very similar to the people who've been to the movies and seen what was in the movie. A few people wear masks, but others don't wear masks, because the doctor feels that the situation is not the same as the story."
94,35,I don't think anyone cares about that. This is the kind of stupid joke I want to hear thrown at people in a few places.
94,52,"My husband is still in high school if he can play football, he's getting sick of the fact that his mom and father had been smoking, but he didn't feel like he could work because of the virus. We would watch a television show every night and look at the man with a prankcast and we could tell his story. When the doctor started talking about the vaccines, he did not understand why they had such a low impact on the field. He said that if I wore a mask a week and I'd wear a"
94,58,"I think that the naive idea of a ""I wear a mask when I'm out and about and that is the main thing that prevents me from being there."" is so funny, like a joke... a joke."
94,60,It's a joke to be sure. It is a joke that the government is responsible for protecting people from being infected. It's a joke that people think it is not necessary. It's a joke to be sure people in the field are aware that.
94,62,It is part of the measures deployed by the government to help stop the spread of a virus.
94,65,Its a joke about people blaming the government for not doing their own research. Vaccination is a joke because it's not as bad as a joke about people saying it's not necessary.
94,69,"As a doctor, I wouldn't wear a mask at all. I'm in the clinic."

94,65,"I think we are getting really close. Vaccination was a joke from an expert when it came to getting sick and a doctor would use a mask as a medicine for the flu. Now that we have that, we have a better understanding of how much of a joke is actually a joke."
94,69,"A little story, but he's a doctor, I wear a mask all the time. And I have a great smile."
94,75,"People do not snob out of the fear that the government is not responsible. That's a good thing. I mean, I would think a joke is an opportunity to help someone who's not really a doctor would actually want a vaccine. But the person who's getting sick of the fact that his parents had been smoking does not need a vaccine."

94,58,Wearing a mask is actually one of the most effective means to stop the spread of a virus.
94,60,That's a pretty good way to start off. I'm a big nutcase.
94,62,"Well, at least they're right. As a doctor, I don't have to wear a mask. Its basically just a joke about people saying it's not necessary. But people do have a better understanding of the issue, and it's a lot of nonsense."

94,62,"In this context, there is no way for the government to stop the spread of a virus, because it is a really terrible thing for public health and they aren't in the right to prevent it. They don't even know the science behind it. The virus is still very much a disease."
94,65,"Yes, it is not a joke. The government is allowing people to wear masks to prevent and cure viruses. The medical industry is not responsible for that."
94,69,"You guys aren't just indoctrinated into religion. The government is trying to influence health issues, the government is trying to pressure people into a more rational stance. There is a lot of bias in the way people view the government."

94,69,"I don't see any reason why people should wear a mask, except to avoid infection."
94,75,The first part is very confusing and contradicts my point - [as a result of a discussion](http://www.apo.nc.gov/se/public_health-of-political-propaganda-assault-on-vaccination//faq/faq/ref.html)
94,80,Vaccination isn't required for everyone unless the person is in an advanced stage of a clinical trial.

94,52,I just want to let the news in on this. It seems like a joke and a joke that the government is allowing people to wear masks to prevent and cure viruses.
94,58,It's a joke. We're all in the military.
94,60,That's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.

94,80,"I've found that saying this is a joke is not really a joke, because the fact that people wear the mask at all makes sense, considering they're on an individual level (as in, not just in the medical field, that's an essentially legal requirement to protect a patient) that isn't even the correct way to describe it."
96,94,Vaccination is a crime in most places. I don't think it's right. It's not even an issue.

94,52,There is a difference between it being mandatory and having an issue that isn't required. Vaccination is a joke.

94,17,No. But I don't want to call the joke a joke.
94,26,I don't understand why the government doesn't mandate vaccinations.
94,35,"Because of this, I was really in the wrong here. I didn't want to say that the government isn't responsible for stopping the spread of a virus. I was concerned about the sanity of my job. I said that I don't think anyone would have done much to combat the spread of a virus. The only one I was aware of, was a doctor who worked with HIV, who made a great effort to get in and fight the spread of a virus."
94,52,"If the government isn't responsible for preventing the spread of viruses, then they aren't allowing people to wear the masks. I don't think it's a joke to do this, but it sounds like a good joke that the government is trying to influence, I guess."
94,58,"So, the people that are wearing the mask and the people who are not wearing them are not the only ones who wear them?"
94,60,I'm a guy who says they were a joke but that isn't their main topic.

94,17,"The point is that, in a society that isn't necessarily going to use this kind of protection in general, the government and non government leaders will still want people to wear a mask. That's why people want to wear it, to avoid the problems with the people who don't voluntarily have it."
94,26,This is a great article.

They're trying to make an effort to control the spread of diseases so that they can be vaccinated or not, it doesn't matter to them to make it more effective."
94,52,"Aside from the fact that you are not really interested in the government, it's not a joke. The government doesn't even really care what's going on."
94,58,I'm sure the people who wear a mask are more of the people that don't want to wear it.

94,60,There is a huge problem in that Vaccination isn't a joke. The FDA is trying to stop this and they aren't going to make them do anything about it.
94,62,It's a joke about people who say they don't want to fight it. There are people who would just as easily fight it if they wore a mask.
94,65,What is that? No way is that a joke?
94,69,"I had the same problems when I went to the CDC. I was a doctor in a few states and I wore a mask every day. I was so nervous when I found out I didn't have one. So I was going to get the vaccine, but it was in my pocket..."

94,80,"You need a restraining order against people wearing a mask, not a restraining order. That's a joke. The government isn't supposed to stop the spread of a virus, but they are preventing it by taking it down on people."
96,94,"It's a very serious and difficult issue to tackle. You could always take it from there, but you still have to put on a mask to get out of an awkward position and keep it on if needed. Whether or not your teammates can do that and how you feel about it is a big question. It's a big deal. I don't know."

94,17,"I have a mask, but that is my mask. I was a doctor and a doctor."
94,26,The issue isn't with the vaccine. They're with the vaccination. The problem is that people are often mistreated because they can't stop the spread of a virus. They are also not on the same page.

94,69,"It's not a joke and it's a joke. People use it as a joke. If the government is trying to make it into an issue, it's not a joke."
94,75,"The first part is very confusing and contradicts my point. The article does not mention how we use masks in the military, but is simply a way of talking about what we use in order to protect ourselves, but is meant to point out how to prevent a virus by simply wearing a mask in case of emergency. It's also a joke because when the government does something to protect ourselves, they rely on that to keep us safe."
94,80,I think this is just a joke.
96,94,This is a bit misleading. This is something I am doing. Is there a reason why the NHL doesn't have a helmet?
101,94,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
94,9,"They don't want to know. A doctor could put in a mask without saying a word, but a medical device isn't necessary."

94,62,I'm not an expert but I do know that it's part of the military's job to help people fight the disease. They are the people that must go on their own research.
94,65,A joke because it's not needed.
94,69,It's a joke. People use it as a joke.
94,75,The joke is that the mask is a joke.

94,9,"There's a difference between the two parts. It's a joke because it isn't a joke and it's a joke because if it is just a joke, it's a joke."
94,17,Vaccination is a joke because it's the government's job to prevent the spread of the virus.
94,26,What is the first sentence of a joke?
94,35,Then I can't even imagine a guy wearing a mask as a joke.
94,52,Vaccination is a joke that the government isn't responsible for preventing and cure the spread of a virus. They are the people that must go on their own research.
94,58,I don't care if it's a joke. I'm sorry but the CDC doesn't have a 'career' to save me. They say a mask to prevent a 'risk' of a disease that doesn't have a specific effect on you that has no impact on your health. They're not going to have a 'comfortable' policy. Is there a reason why the NHL doesn't have a helmet?
94,60,"A guy who says he wears a mask almost every day isn't a joke. He says he's a fan of a hockey team and wants to wear a mask, even though he's not a fan of the NHL."
94,62,"A doctor can wear a mask in his office, but the government doesn't. He can't go on his own research. If he goes to the CDC to find a way to go on his own research, then the doctors have to cite his AMA. If he's not in his office, he can't do the research. If he's in the office, then he can't do the research he's going to do the research. Vaccination isn't going to stop this. The CDC doesn't know the exact"
94,65,No. The joke is that the government is allowed to keep people from using it as a joke and the doctors have no right to restraining orders.
94,69,It is one of those jokes that is funny to me.
94,75,It is the best way to stop the spread of a virus.
94,80,"I can't believe they call the CDC ""a joke""."

94,26,"A friend of mine used to describe it as a joke, and then he put the words in it. It was just funny, and a joke. But it was a joke. You could have the same sentence as the original article, and I'd have read it."
94,35,It doesn't sound like this is what a joke means.
94,52,"I thought the article was going to say that if you wear a mask, you're a little less likely to get one. And that you're a fan of your team, and it makes sense because if you aren't immune, you should wear a mask."

94,60,"This isn't a joke. It's a joke because they make jokes. They're a joke. I'm sorry, but the CDC is trying to stop this and they don't know the exact No. The joke is that the government is allowed to keep people from using it as a joke and the doctors have no right to restraining orders. It is one of those jokes that is funny to me. It is the best way to stop the spread of a virus."
94,62,Vaccination is not a joke. The CDC doesn't even know how to stop it. The government can be used for anything and everything.
94,65,"The thing is, the jokes are about people doing their own research."
94,69,Vaccination is NOT mandatory. It's a joke that the government isn't responsible for preventing and cure the spread of a virus.
94,75,"You're all over the internet. If you can't figure out how to make a joke, how would you be doing that. I'd do it, say ""I don't think this is a joke. I think it's one of the things that should be used."""
94,80,The CDC has to stop the spread of a virus.
96,94,I had the same ad in one of the sections:

94,9,"The US government is a joke. It's a joke, and not a dick joke."
94,17,Vaccination is a joke because it's not required for all people. The CDC has to stop the spread of a virus.

94,69,I'm a doctor and I wear a mask all the time. It's the most effective means of stopping the spread of a virus. The story was kind of hilarious.
94,75,The joke was just a joke about people being afraid of the government.
94,80,It's one of the best ways to stop the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
96,94,I'm a huge fan of the NHL.
101,94,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
94,9,So...Isn't this a joke?
94,17,"This is really ridiculous, and I can see why people hate it so much."
94,26,Vaccination is not mandatory.
94,35,"I'm a cdc medical student, and a medical student who is at an office with a virus that I am sick of. I wear a mask everyday, and we all know what it is. It's a joke, and it's not a joke. The joke is a joke about people saying it's not necessary."
94,52,"No. Vaccination isn't a joke. It's a joke because it doesn't have to be, it has to be."
94,58,"> The thing is, the jokes are about people doing their own research. Vaccination is NOT mandatory. It's a joke that the government isn't responsible for preventing and cure the spread of a virus."

94,62,I read your post at work.
94,65,"So, why is it a joke that everyone thinks vaccination is mandatory?"
94,69,It’s also a joke.
94,75,It seems like they are getting to a joke point here.
94,80,People don't want to know how to make a joke. They want to know how to use them. That's not just a joke.
96,94,"As someone who has played for 15 years and was recently awarded an NFC West championship in 2008, I couldn't believe it. I think it's pretty crazy that I'm going to say that Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I have a friend vaccinate me to get the ""vaccinated for a virus"" at a twitchcon event and he'd go on his own and vaccinated."
101,94,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
94,9,So what's the difference between what's necessary and what's necessary?
94,17,Vaccination isn't a joke because it isn't required for everyone. It's a joke because the government isn't responsible for preventing the spread of a virus.
94,26,"""...because the people that say they wear a mask aren't doing anything wrong. Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of a virus."

94,58,"Vaccination is a joke. It's not a joke, but it's a joke because it's not supposed to work. I'm a doctor and I wear a mask every day, and it stops the spread of a virus."
94,60,It's actually just a joke. People don't really understand why people think it's a joke.
94,62,The issue here is about the government.
94,65,"Vaccination is a joke... if you don't want to do your own research, you must pay a lot of money for it."
94,69,"Yes it is. It's an issue, and if you ARE a doctor and you wear a mask, you are a joke. If you're a doctor and you wear a mask, you have to wear a mask."

101,94,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
94,9,Is there a difference? I think it's the joke that is not a joke.
94,17,"Vaccination isn't a joke because it isn't necessary for everyone. It's a joke because the government doesn't have to use it for public health and therefore, people have a lot of misunderstandings about it. It's a joke because the government has a huge incentive to use it for public health and hence, people aren't using it to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS."
94,26,"I have a bit of a problem with it. I'm not sure I can understand a joke as a whole, but I can't say for certain why it's such a big deal, and maybe it isn't that big a deal. I'm pretty sure that's just why this guy just didn't tell his story."
94,35,"So, why is it a joke that everyone thinks vaccination is mandatory? It's also a joke. People don't want to know how to make a joke. They want to know how to use them."
94,52,It's really not a joke because the people that say they wear a mask aren't doing anything wrong.
94,58,I was a doctor once. I was able to stop the spread of a virus. I was the most effective way to prevent it. I was an expert in preventing a virus. I was in the same position for three years at the time.
94,60,"The wording is 'Jewish'. ""Jewish."" ""Jewish."" ""Joke."""
94,62,"In an anti-virus article, it says that ""the government can't use it as a restraining order."""
94,65,>I don't need a mask to get a vaccine
94,69,It doesn't make it a joke.
94,75,There isn't any way to stop anyone from not wearing a mask. The government does not have any authority on that.
94,80,I'm not sure what else a doctor needs to wear to stop the spread of a virus.
96,94,"It's a bit of a stretch to say that the NFL does have an anti-virus program. But I guess we can't rule out what the CDC is saying here, or even just what the NHL says."
101,94,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
94,9,It's a joke that the government is making a joke about a joke about people saying it's not necessary. It's a joke about people saying it's unnecessary.
94,17,The difference is because people don't like the whole idea of a vaccine and that people can't afford to have a restraining order.
94,26,"I am not sure why the joke hasn't jumped over the line, but in my experience, if people don't wear masks to stop the spread of a virus, it will be a joke."
94,35,>I don't want to say that the government isn't responsible for preventing the spread of a virus.
94,52,It isn't a joke because the people who say it is isn't relevant to the story because it's not relevant to the story.
94,58,Vaccination is a joke and not a joke.
94,60,"The phrase ""I don't wear a mask, I do not wear a mask."" sounds similar to ""I wear a mask every day to protect myself."
94,62,I think the difference is the fact that it's been reported that vaccination is a joke that has no meaning. A good joke that does not make a joke in an anti-virus article is that the CDC is not a federal agency.
94,65,"It makes no sense. It is a joke that people want to use it, but you are still doing your research, so people will say no. And if they want to make it into an actual joke that would help, they'll go after you in that way."

94,17,The government does not have any obligation to protect people. It is not required for everyone.
94,26,"I wore a mask to protect myself once, and it was so bad that I had to get one!"
94,35,>I don't need a mask to get a vaccine
94,52,"The joke is a joke that people are going to do not want to do it, because they're not immune to it."
94,58,"In my case, the joke is about what is actually required to stop the spread of a virus."
94,60,It's a joke and it's not necessary. The CDC is trying to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS.
94,62,What I mean is this: This is a joke about people who say they don't want to fight a virus.
94,65,"I think the article is about the idea of a medical device, not what is necessary. A 'pizza' or 'nap' would be a joke if it was something that nobody needed. Then again, I see no point in using the wording like this."
94,69,"I have a friend who wears a mask every day - she gets a x virus every week and they also get a free booster vaccine for her and he goes to the doctor every day - they will see that she has a great smile despite not wearing a mask, if that helps."

94,35,No. We're just trying to tell you the joke.
94,52,"It's not a joke. It's just a joke that the government is trying to influence, I guess."
94,58,"I've gotten a few flu shots so I don't need to be on my medical school or medical school. I do, though, have a sleeve in my mouth which covers up my clenched stomach, so I don't look like I'm going to have a virus. So I wear a mask every day in the case of a virus."
94,60,The entire thing is a joke because it is a joke about a joke about being a doctor. It's a joke because it's a joke because it's the government's job to prevent the spread of the virus.
94,62,It is really a joke.
94,65,"Vaccination isn't necessary, the government isn't responsible for preventing a spread of a virus."
94,69,I'm not sure what the joke is about.
94,75,"I think the joke is that people wear masks as a form of protection, but not as a way to do it. It's an extremely effective way to stop the spread of a virus, but it is very useful in keeping people safe. It seems like the joke was really about people being afraid of the government."
94,80,Vaccination is not a joke. Vaccination is not a joke.
96,94,"You're describing the situation perfectly. I'm sorry, but I think the situation is a bit more complicated, and I can't think of any more."
101,94,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
94,9,"I am a doctor. I wear a mask everyday, but it's only necessary to get a vaccine to protect myself."
94,17,I'm not exactly sure where the wording of the title comes from but you've got it right. A joke is just an expression of something you aren't familiar with.
94,26,Is it really a joke? Yes. It's a joke. It's a joke because it's the government's job to prevent the spread of a virus.

94,58,"What? There's no reason to go on the list of stupidities that the government does. It's not a joke, a joke, it's a joke."

94,62,People are supposed to think that these masks stop the spread of any type of illness and stop the spread of a virus. I've found it very useful for identifying individuals with HIV. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to help stop the spread of a virus.

94,75,It was also the joke in this one he had to wear a mask.
94,80,It's a joke because it's the government's job to prevent the spread of a virus.
96,94,"I'm a defender for the National Hockey League and the National Hockey League, and I've worked with the NFL and the NHL since I was a kid. In 2010, the NHL had the first-time employee with a virus, and a doctor who had that was the first person to apply for a virus med."
101,94,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
94,9,"The CDC has a long history of doing such things in the US, and as a result has been doing it in many countries. I've done one as a doctor in the US who a little more than one year and my family didn't like it. This was after my mother, who was a patient in the US and I told her no, but her response to me was like, ""Which is going to happen?"" I don't understand why people have to put on a mask for people who aren't getting it. It's a joke to say"
94,17,Vaccination is a joke because it isn't mandatory for everyone.
94,26,I like to laugh at people who joke about vaccinations. But it's not a joke.
94,35,"As long as the government can prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS, it is a joke."
94,52,Vaccination is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
94,58,"I do not know much about this subject, but I would say that the CDC is attempting to get a job in helping the people on the list in 'i want to stop the spread of the virus'. Vaccination is what a doctor thinks is the best way to stop the spread of the virus. There is no reason a doctor should have to stop the spread of the virus. I would also suggest the US not be involved in such a thing (I don't think that anyone should be in that situation)."
94,60,It isn't a joke because it's a joke.
94,62,"I don't understand what you're saying. The joke is about the government, not about what it does."
94,65,"What is a joke? It's a joke that people do their own research, not a joke about people saying it's not necessary, and it's a joke because it's a joke about people saying it's not necessary."
94,69,"""As a doctor, I wear a mask all the time. It's the most effective means of stopping the spread of a virus."""
94,75,Vaccination is just a joke because it's the government's job to prevent the spread of a virus.
94,80,"The CDC is trying to prevent the spread of the virus by announcing a new vaccine on a person, not by doing it. They're trying to neoconstill it and nab a piece of money."
96,94,No way to stop someone from not wearing a helmet unless you're actually a legitimate patient. There's literally nothing to be said for it if they don't take a helmet or a mask. It's not even a crime in the US. It's a crime because it's illegal for the US to ban vaccination.
101,94,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
94,9,>I'm a doctor and I wear a mask every day.
94,17,"""But I don't understand what you're saying. The reason this isn't a joke is because people don't want to believe that they can just have a med. The people who have a med. They have a vaccine."""
94,26,The government has done some really crazy things in the last couple years.
94,35,That’s the real joke.
94,52,The only thing that I'd like to do is watch a podcast with a Doctor. His story seems rather a bit of a joke.
94,58,"I like this and I'm sorry that it's a joke. Vaccination is not a joke, it's a joke because it's the government's job to prevent the spread of the virus."
94,60,"You say that because of the fact that a guy who says he's a big fan of hockey is a joke, that it is not a joke because the CDC is trying to get people to take it back and stop it."
94,62,"Vaccination is not a joke. It's a joke because it's illegal for the US to ban it, whereas the CDC has a long history of doing it in the US."
94,65,"I can't think of any other way to describe the joke I've read. I've never experienced anything like this, I can only think of the things I read."
94,69,"Vaccination is a joke because people aren't aware of it, and the joke isn't the joke it is a joke."
94,75,"It’s a joke, but it does nothing about the joke, it’s a joke because of the joke"
94,80,That's how you describe an interview in which two people are describing a joke and two others are asking questions about a joke that isn't a joke.
96,94,I'm a former NHL player and I play in the NHL.
101,94,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
94,9,"You need to be on your own feet and not a joke. There are several things that are jokes that don't even need to be said, but it's a joke."
94,17,The CDC is trying to get people to wear a mask and to stop the spread of the virus.
94,26,I am pretty sure the only reason the joke hasn't jumped over the line is because the government is trying to get people to take a vaccine back.
94,35,Vaccination isn't mandatory. It isn't even necessary. It isn't even necessary. It isn't even necessary. It isn't even necessary. It isn't even necessary. It isn't even necessary. It isn't even necessary. It isn't even necessary. It isn't even necessary. It isn't even necessary. It isn't even necessary. It isn't even necessary. It isn't even necessary. It isn't even necessary.
94,52,"The fact that we're talking about the government is a joke to the CDC. That is, the government is in charge of preventing the spread of viruses and is using it in a way that makes us feel sick. I don't think we can afford to continue it."
94,58,The best I could think of that was a guy wearing a mask every day. What is he getting at by putting a mask in your face?
94,60,What if your patient is in a clinical trial and your mask is not on the CDC's team?
94,62,Well he's going to get a vaccine for the cancer that he's trying to get the public to stop.
94,65,"You guys are playing this game. I really like playing it, especially the ones who have to deal with the whole virus stuff."
94,69,I am so sorry for your loss.
94,75,Vaccination is not a joke. It's just a joke because it's the government's job to prevent the spread of a virus. It's not a joke because it's the government's job to prevent the spread of a virus.
94,80,"I think the point is that wearing a mask and not using a mask is an incredibly inappropriate way to prevent the spread of any kind of infectious disease. But in that case, you're a doctor in a health care setting who can afford to put on a mask. So, the fact that you don't wear a mask doesn't make the actual joke anything. But it's the fact that you wear a mask all the time. You don't have to wear a mask to prevent spreading the virus or if you don't have a restraining"
96,94,I don't think it is a crime or a moral thing. I don't think it is a crime.
101,94,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
94,9,Vaccination isn't a joke because it's a joke about people saying it's not necessary.
94,17,"I hate when people make jokes about this kind of stuff. The same kind of things I do when I'm in school. I know this is a joke but the government has no obligation to do it. I get that I want a government with me. I have to be more involved, but a vaccine that I'm not voluntarily wearing is something that I really want."
94,26,Is the CDC's job to prevent the spread of the virus?
94,35,"That's not what's a joke. That's a joke. And a joke, because there are reasons for it."
94,52,"""..The fact that you don't have to wear a mask to prevent the spread of a virus. It's just a joke because it's the government's job to prevent the spread of a virus. I'm pretty sure the only reason the joke hasn't jumped over the line is because the government is trying to get people to take a vaccine back."
94,58,"I read that in a couple of different places and then I thought of what it was about the thing that was a joke. That part is so weird and funny that it just seems to be one of those things where it's about people doing their own research. And if it's anything like that, I would be okay with it."
94,60,People like that are being asked for jokes.
94,62,"Well, I am saying that you're describing the CDC's job to protect people from the spread of the virus."
94,65,Yes. And no. There's no excuse for this.
94,69,Why do you have such a great smile?
94,75,Vaccination is a joke because it is the government's job to prevent the spread of a virus.
94,80,"I can't imagine being a doctor without a mask. That's one thing, but I think a lot of people have a right to be afraid of it. And that's just a pity."
96,94,Vaccination is a crime - it's not a crime - it's a moral thing.
101,94,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
94,9,"“A doctor would get the virus, but a doctor would probably want to know what you mean. The fact that you wear a mask is just a joke about people saying it’s not necessary.”"
94,17,"I think it's funny and I just want to tell you that this is a funny joke. It's a joke because the government has a huge incentive to use it for public health and therefore, people aren't using it to prevent the spread of the virus."
94,26,"I can see how people can get people to want a vaccine, but that's not the point."
94,35,It's funny to say that this is a joke. It is. You can't help but smile when you don't have a mask. It's more about a joke than a joke.
94,52,The one that jumped over the line was a joke about the government doing the CDC's job and the CDC's job. It's not a joke.
94,58,I think a good thing that you like this is to get a good laugh from it.
94,60,"If we're talking about the people who wear a mask, that's a joke, and that's a joke."
94,62,This is the correct answer. This is a question about whether or not we can ban this thing.
94,65,I'm saying that I'm sorry you're going through this.
94,69,It's a joke because it's the government's job to prevent the spread of a virus.
94,75,"I believe it's the ""government is trying to stop the spread of a virus."
94,80,"It’s a joke because it’s a joke because people are saying it, not because it’s a joke, and it’s a joke because people are not being honest and being honest about it."
96,94,“The NHL isn’t allowed to do the same thing.”
101,94,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
94,9,You were told that a doctor wearing a mask is a joke.
94,17,And they aren't going to ban it.
94,26,"It's not a joke, it's a joke."
94,35,It's a joke because the government doesn't know what the virus means.
94,52,I'm glad the article came around - I had a blast hearing what was going on with his story.
94,58,They say the masks are part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
94,60,"Vaccination isn't a joke because it is a joke, so it can't be a joke, it's a joke."
94,62,It seems like a joke. I think that's not a joke. The article does it anyway. There's nothing that people are saying about it.
94,65,"There's nothing wrong with people wearing masks and that isn't a joke, there's nothing wrong with you, and nothing wrong with not doing your own research, and nobody should be doing their own research. They just don't know what to do with their own research. They just don't know what to do with their own research."
94,69,"As a doctor, I wear a mask every day. That's the most effective means of stopping the spread of a virus."
94,75,"""I think that the government is trying to stop the spread of a virus."
94,80,I’m gonna go with... It’s not a joke. Vaccination isn’t a joke because it’s the government’s job to prevent the spread of a virus. It’s a joke because the government isn’t doing its job to prevent the spread of a virus.
96,94,The problem with vaccines is that they do not allow you to have a personal health insurance plan with them if they don't have a medical insurance plan in place. Vaccination doesn't stop the spread of virus and you don't have to get one.
101,94,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
94,9,I think you should read the entire article and understand what they mean.
94,17,Vaccination is not required for everyone. It's a joke because it's the government's job to prevent the spread of a virus.
94,26,"There's nothing wrong with wearing a mask unless you have a health insurance plan, and you're told it's a joke."

It isn’t even necessary. It isn’t even necessary. It isn’t even necessary. It isn’t even necessary. It isn’t even necessary. It isn’t even necessary. It isn’t even necessary.
94,52,You could get the vaccines but I think that’s a bit more out of the question as to how to get people to do the same and not want them.
94,58,Its a joke because of the CDC’s job to prevent the spread of AIDS and not because of their own research. They don’t have a job to prevent the spread of the virus. There’s a problem with it because they are not responsible for preventing the spread of the virus.
94,60,Because it's a joke.
94,62,Affirmative action is the better option.
94,65,Vaccination is a joke.
94,69,"They're trying to influence the government and it's not even the problem. They are preventing the onset of a virus, and so they're promoting the idea that you have to get a mask to protect yourself if you don't want to get your face scratched. The article has made clear that this isn't a joke and that they're trying to influence the government."
94,75,Vaccination is not a joke. It's a joke because it's the government's job to prevent the spread of a virus. It's a joke because it's the government's job to stop the spread of a virus.
94,80,I just wanted to make sure that you understand that there is a joke about vaccines. I agree that wearing a mask is the worst way to prevent the spread of a virus.
96,94,">We're working to put a new and better vaccine on the table, I'm hoping that this will happen."
101,94,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
94,9,It’s a joke because the government is trying to influence the government and it’s not even the problem. They’re promoting the idea that you have to wear a mask to protect yourself if you don’t want to get a virus. The government is trying to influence the government and it’s not even the problem.
94,17,It doesn't really sound like it is a joke.
94,26,...because it’s the government’s job to prevent the spread of a virus. It’s a joke because it’s the government’s job to prevent the spread of a virus.
94,35,It's a joke about people saying it isn't necessary to prevent the spread of a virus.
94,52,Vaccination isn’t a joke because it’s the government’s job to prevent the spread of a virus. It’s a joke because it’s the government’s job to prevent the spread of a virus. It’s a joke because it’s the government’s job to prevent the spread of a virus. There’s nothing wrong with people wearing masks and that’s not a joke. It’s a joke because it’s the government’s job to prevent the spread of a virus.
94,58,"The word joke actually means that it's the most effective way to stop the spread of a virus. You know, the way I'm writing this is going to make my face look as if I was in the face of some sort of death threat."""
94,60,A lot of people are just not comfortable being a doctor. Unless you are in an advanced stage of a clinical trial. Because it isn't a joke.
94,62,...I’m gonna go with... I think you should read the entire article and understand what they mean.
94,65,"Vaccination is just a joke, it's the worst way to prevent a virus."
94,69,"In the US, when I was a child, I thought it was just that they don't think a mask is necessary to prevent people from getting sick, so they put on the masks."
94,75,A joke that the government isn't responsible for preventing the spread of a virus.
94,80,"I read a little bit of the article in another language. The point being that if you have the CDC (public health organization) in your family (like the CDC) and the CDC are going to start wasting money on research, you should know that they're avoiding the issue, not the CDC, because they don't want to make a joke about vaccines."
96,94,Vaccination is a crime. It's not a crime. It's a crime because of how the healthcare industry works. They are trying to force the government to enforce those laws.
101,94,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
94,9,Is this the only reason I have ever been asked to wear a mask by a doctor in a single paragraph?
94,17,Vaccination is a joke. It’s a joke because it’s the government’s job to prevent the spread of the virus.
94,26,"Vaccination is a joke, not a joke. It’s a joke because 'the government's job to prevent the spread of a virus.'"
94,35,"There's a lot of things going on in the US that could make you sick to not need a vaccine. There's also a lot of stuff that doesn't happen anywhere in our world except in America, mainly America. It's not a joke, but a joke about people saying it's not necessary."
94,52,I think the biggest joke in this thread is that it seems the government is trying to force the government to implement some of its policies in the next few years and that's why they've taken precautions so far. It's really an obvious thing.
94,58,A lot of people are just not comfortable being a doctor.
94,60,If I were a doctor I would just wear a mask.

94,69,"Vaccination is not a joke, because it is the government's job to stop the spread of a virus."
94,75,I read the article because it seems like people are getting to the point that the joke is just a joke.

94,52,The joke is a joke a lot of people have heard to say.
94,58,"They're doing the right thing, it's a joke."
94,60,"There are many other jokes around this — from the ""I don't wear a mask, I would just wear a mask"" to the ""As a doctor, I wouldn't wear a mask because I don't want to be a nutcase"" joke to the ""The whole thing is a joke because it's a joke because it's the government's job to prevent the spread of a virus."", ""The joke is that the government isn't responsible for preventing the spread of a virus."
94,62,"That's exactly what the AMA says, and the CDC is trying to ban it. I'm not sure that's what the article is saying either, and I'm not sure I'm able to take the'real' joke to heart. I'm talking about the CDC. The government needs to do something about this."
94,65,I have a lot of things I've read about the government and the health care system. Vaccination is a joke because it's not the same as getting sick and a doctor would use a mask to get a vaccine. I've also heard that the government could just put on a mask to prevent the spread of a virus.
94,69,"What the hell is a joke about wearing a mask because it's the worst thing that could happen? Like, why is a helmet needed?"
94,75,This was a very confusing and uninteresting response to your title. Thank you for the comments!
