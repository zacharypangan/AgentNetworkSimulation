47,15,those who want to protect themselves from getting sick have every right to masks keep you more safe than no mask in tight settings everyone has the right to do whatever they want now at their discretion

15,3,I think the idea of a'm wearing a mask outside while vaccinated' is a bit unsettling. It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
15,14,"I'm a federal citizen, so I'm gonna assume this is a common myth."
16,15,"In the US, wear a mask to prevent infections. Wear a mask to help prevent infection. It is an essential precaution to get your health at the highest possible levels, and it is a good way to ensure you have plenty of safety."
22,15,It’s pretty good. Do you think the CDC wants us to wear a mask that doesn’t actually contain the disease? Maybe even the CDC wants to go after a small part of the population that would otherwise die in the future.
47,15,"If the government did mandates in 2006, I can't imagine the problems with it today. I'm sure this will happen in the near future."
52,15,"The President of the United States. It seems the government has a right to keep it in the closet, but that means they have to keep it in. It's also in the administration's power. They could have been just as shocked to come up with this nonsense."
54,15,"What? The president is a total moron, it s the government, you don t have to be in his shoes, if you are putting on a mask, you are not in the wrong place."
57,15,"No one is giving it to you. Just to show off, you need a helmet."

16,15,It sounds like your brother and I both have very different views of the subject.
22,15,"In this case, I would not wear a mask if I didn't need to get vaccinated and I wouldn't be able to stand under my shirt."
47,15,"Almost everyone wears a mask for a vaccination, but there are many people that are not."
52,15,It's pretty ridiculous for the government to require a man to wear a mask to prevent the spread of a virus.
54,15,i do not understand how some people get irrational reactions when they see a public health order vs the reality that their team is at war with the senate
57,15,"> The mask on the head is a medical device worn by the government, and so it is a good way to prevent the spread. There is no real reason to make that choice. There's no repercussions unless you have an open mind and aren't sure what the consequences are."
60,15,There is a reason why the first part of the title of the thread is 'wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. What does wearing a mask with a mask have to do with the illness?
78,15,"I'd be so shocked if they just made the OP wear a mask because it has the same effect. Wearing a mask helps stop the spread of a virus. In a medical class, they do it for free on their exams. That's not very effective for anyone who carries a virus or has had one. Wearing a mask helps in stopping the spread of a virus."

15,14,"Wearing a mask, especially while vaccinated, is part of the vaccines that it uses to help prevent spread of a disease. That is a mask for a vaccine."
16,15,Yes it is. The mask is a good thing. They can protect themselves against the sexism. It is also good for people to prevent it.
22,15,"My brother has had the same issue with a mask since he was 8 years old. He got his first and most effective vaccine. I'm sure it's the kind of thing that doesn't work for everyone, but he's just a dick."
47,15,">I'm not sure if the people in that movie are stupid or not, but they do have a good point about the government, not 'wearing a mask'."
52,15,I'm not saying that it's ridiculous but that it's definitely a bad idea.

57,15,"> I was the one wearing a mask for a week, and I've been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that."
60,15,That's a good question to ask for clarification.
78,15,"The people who want to wear them don't deserve it. Honestly, I can see a lot of people wearing masks at work in that school."

15,14,I don't understand why people want to wear a mask if it doesn't protect themselves.
16,15,"This isn't an election issue, but a fact of life and the government's attempt to cut its budget to prevent people from spreading viruses."
22,15,"I know we do not have a vaccine but this is very important for us. You need to know the exact same thing about it and you can take it to the doctor for advice, so that when you do, you can be prepared to go."
47,15,People who have no idea who they're a person in the movie are a lot like the CDC in a lot of ways.
52,15,"You guys need to do more research on the government. The ""Made in America"" article is going to be full of examples. The guy who is wearing the mask said that the government's job is to protect the man, not prevent the spread of the virus. The President of the United States doesn't wear a mask for the flu, but for the mask, he is wearing a mask to prevent the spread of the virus. The guy who is wearing the mask is saying that the government should use masks for prevention and to prevent the spread of virus."
54,15,"Despite the fact that you're not a fan of the ACA, it isn't something to support and it can't be used to defend those who don't have it."
57,15,Why is this nonsense happening to you? Are you going to do the exact same thing you're causing to your son? You can fuck this up or you can't.
60,15,People are trying to explain why they have no idea about the effects of viruses on the population. And it's been a while since I've seen people wear masks to get the virus off people.
78,15,The issue is not just the ACA but the other factors for people who have HIV/AIDS.
85,15,i think the obama is being sarcastic.
97,15,"I grew up in a conservative town in Georgia, and I think I've never even heard of this ""Fight Club"" or ""Hands up"" thing. I hate when people say things like ""I love you."" and ""I hate the fact that he makes you feel safe for you!"" and they're so smug about it. I don't think it's funny at all that some people think that it's ""as fun as fuck, but I just like when people do it""."

47,15,They say a lot of people don't wear a mask because the government is trying to prevent the spread of the flu. Is it a good idea to have a mask?
52,15,"I don't think there's a real reason for people to wear a mask, and I think there is."
54,15,What you're doing is just making fun of people whose life they have a mask in.
57,15,That is one 'fucking joke' that people should be ashamed of.
60,15,"> I would never want to go to a party if I had to go, not wear a mask at all. If I was on the team it would help prevent the spread of a virus."
78,15,I'm glad the guy is a moron.
85,15,he's being sarcastic.
97,15,"I'm not sure I can say that anyone thinks that is funny, but I just can't think of a guy who hasn't gone through what would make that joke a joke and they would actually do it and it would make his life worse and he would actually have some of the people to re-examine a question about, so they would have to take what was actually a joke and give it to them and see what would happen if they did that."
15,3,"So you're going to say something like, ""Oh fuck that. I lied, I'll give you a nice jacket."""
15,14,"People wear a mask to protect the environment, but the people in the movie know it."
16,15,The most terrifying dreadful part of the video is how he tried to steal a hat from his brother. It's not his job to protect someone who isn't infected with a virus. He's trying to help people with a very expensive virus.
22,15,"I can't believe there is so much 'what's wrong' that a CDC would try and put a label on a flier, the CDC doesn't like it, they just want people to be able to understand if something is happening that's not what they need or aren't aware of and have no way to get around it."
47,15,Those who want to protect themselves from getting sick have every right to masks keep you more safe than no mask in tight settings everyone has the right to do whatever they want now at their discretion.
52,15,"Honestly, I don't think people should be wearing a mask as they'd be able to help stop the spread of the virus."
54,15,"I'm a Democrat and this is a big red flag, not a joke."
57,15,"The sexist comments are not a joke, but the lack of real proof. If you wanted to be a good football coach you need to do this - just say that it's all about the government's ability to stop the spread of a virus."
60,15,I think what they are trying to answer is: People are trying to explain why they have no idea about the effects of viruses on the population.
78,15,"I was told by a friend of mine, that we are able to use some masks to stop the spread of a virus if we wear them. They are so strong that they can help combat it. We were taught this as a child, so we can only use them in cases where we don't have an insurance policy that allows them to do so. I was also taught this as a child to wear masks in public, which is a very common idea among people in the US."
85,15,Are you aware that the CDC is invading an entire nation?
97,15,I’m actually from Georgia.
15,3,"So it's a joke, and the people in the movie don't know it?"

60,15,I just wanted to throw you the best joke of the week... that was a lot of shit. But this guy was a skunk. He's a skunk.
78,15,What is the point of wearing a mask in public?
85,15,"That's right, the fact that it's a national health system which is a huge issue, as well as a symptom."
97,15,"I don't really understand why this guy can't seem to get a head start, but I know it's not a good joke. I think they should make a show about him, and they shouldn't just take a look at all the other comments."

15,14,Why does he ever wear a mask outside?
16,15,... and you mean the government? It's making money in a way. It sounds like it's a joke.
22,15,It's not that the government is in favor of people who don't vaccinate - it's that they're doing their best to keep them safe.
47,15,I'm very worried about it. I just hope a few people aren't infected because they can't go see a doctor or a vaccinated person without a mask in order to keep their private life safe. It's a petty issue and a great way to prevent it.
52,15,I feel the same way if you don't know what to say about that.
54,15,People have different definitions of their mask. You are saying it's more effective to show your face to your boss? Or even your employer?

16,15,"As a Canadian, I think the best way to understand this is by getting to know the US. It's not as easy as saying we wear a mask to prevent the spread of a virus, but it's not really the same thing as saying the CDC should be able to tell people what to do with it."
22,15,"I wore a mask and a helmet at a CDC event last month, so it doesn't make any sense to ask for someone to wear a mask. This is just how the government works, not like we would be seeing a skunk from a bridge."

54,15,It's the opposite. I just wanted to share my perspective on this.
57,15,"If you are a college football coach, you are not an expert in health law and you are not an expert in sexist jokes."
60,15,People are trying to explain why they have no idea about the effects of viruses on the population. The only joke of all time was made when the NRA started shitstorming about it and they got very concerned about how they were going to be skeptics. They were making a joke about it.
78,15,CANNOTANSWER:

47,15,What if people have no idea who they're as a person in the movie?
52,15,"Those two sentences are all very similar. The CIA is making some really stupid and absurd jokes about the ACA to stop it from spreading a CDC. That is a very legitimate joke, and the government is basically just blatantly misleading people to be ok with it. They are also helping to avoid the ACA."
54,15,This is what I wrote in order to get my perspective.
57,15,I was able to see some really cool things from the interview about it.
60,15,The article is the worst of all the idiots in the world.
78,15,It's a joke because of the humor and the way it's done.
85,15,he's gonna have a hat.

16,15,People who think they are entitled to the safety of themselves and the rights of others are being dragged on the other side.
22,15,People are becoming more and more hesitant to wear any kind of vaccinating mask in public because they want to stop the spread of a disease. The ACA and a lot of other health issues are trying to prevent and stop this.
47,15,"The ACA isn't a joke. It's a joke, in all its many contexts."

97,15,I'm a little embarrassed. I don't think I can really believe that you're being a bit of a jerk if you say that.
15,3,It's a joke because it's a joke and it's a joke because it's a joke.
15,14,What the NRA is trying to do with this is it is a joke about the government's failure to prevent the spread of a virus.
16,15,I believe the AMA is about the ACA. It's not a joke. But it's about a joke.
22,15,I have been through this a few times. The first time I noticed it was a joke. It was a bad one because I didn't 'get it'. Then I had the flu. It was a frightened hivemind. I've already vaccinated and they don't care if I have one.
47,15,It's a joke.
52,15,"So the guy who is wearing a mask in the closet, ""I don't think it's ridiculous for the government to require a man to wear a mask to prevent the spread of the virus."""

15,3,I'm going to look up the movie [NAMA/Support] that's related to the ACA. The author's words are from his perspective.
15,14,The AMA is actually a joke.

22,15,I know these people are not being serious about it but there's still a lot of information and ideas based on this kind of nonsense. I don't know where you are.
47,15,People in this movie are not a dick. They are not a joke.
52,15,You should probably do some research before making a comment on this.
54,15,Is that what the president did to try to prevent a virus spreading to people he doesn't know?
57,15,You're a cynic.
60,15,So the best part of the AMA is that I'm not a lawyer.
78,15,"The ACA is a joke, and the idea is a joke, and the idea is an offensive one."
85,15,"You're using an adjective ""a joke"" as an op-nomous comment. That's what I meant."
97,15,"He is gonna get a shitload of upvotes for ""Neh, I don't think he's racist, I just don't think the OP has the sense to know if he's racist."""
15,3,Is it the ACA that is getting the attention it deserves?
15,14,"People like the guy in the movie don't have a good point about the government. People wear a mask outside to protect themselves, but people don't wear a mask to protect the environment."
16,15,You're being a doppelganger because it's not about the ACA and the AMA. You're being a doppelganger because you're being a doppelganger because you're being a doppelganger because you're not in the article and you don't understand why you're being a doppelganger.
22,15,You could go into another part of the joke. And you could say something along the lines of 'this is one of the biggest political and economic issues in history. You're an idiot. You're not an idiot.
47,15,'Violations aren't a joke. They are just better than vaccines. Vaccines are better than vaccines. Those who don't have AIDS and need them aren't vaccinated.
52,15,I feel like this is pretty much the first paragraph of a good joke.
54,15,I don't understand what you mean /r/AskNJibs?
57,15,Aren't you going to die.
60,15,I think you are the best person on this thread. The AMA was about people who wanted to know what the virus was.
78,15,People are going to wear a mask for an ACA to prevent people from getting sick. It's a joke.
85,15,I mean OP is right about the ACA and I don't see it being a joke but he also doesn't know the other person's opinion or why it's such a joke. The one I remember is just my family.
97,15,"""Hey man, I love you. I love the fact that he makes you feel safe for you!"" is the top ten."
15,3,"You could say 'It's just a joke,' or 'It's just a joke because it's a joke' or 'It's just a joke."
15,14,AMA is a joke.
16,15,"I think you have a valid point, but I would like to draw a line from the article:"
22,15,Vaccines and other health issues are trying to prevent people from putting themselves in danger. The ACA and a lot of other health issues are trying to stop it.
47,15,I think it's a good idea to make a joke about it. That would be a joke if you were a doctor. I'd think that the CDC would have a good reason to want to stop the spread of AIDS.
52,15,"What is your personal opinion on it? I was the one who put the ""Made in America"" article down after reading the wikipedia article."
54,15,I would suggest rethinking that.
57,15,I like how a person who plays a national role as a football coach is being a cynic about things they do to get ahead.
60,15,"The AMA was about HIV/AIDS, not HIV/AIDS. The AMA is about the CDC trying to make it illegal and the AMA is about a joke about the AMA."
78,15,"So it’s a joke? No, the government’s skunks are telling the truth, the government’s skunks are making a joke about the ACA because they know it’s a joke, and the government has no power to change the health care system? No."

15,3,"I'm talking about the ACA. I'm not saying the ACA is a joke, but I think the idea of wearing a mask outside is a joke."
15,14,It's a joke.
16,15,"I think that the ""joke"" is based on the fact that people haven't heard of it and that he's not a fan of the AMA, he just doesn't like the idea of having to wear a mask in public and thinks it's a joke to put the public at risk."
22,15,AMA is a joke.
47,15,"Because, while the ACA has nothing to do with preventing the spread of AIDS, AIDS isn't the same as AIDS. If you want to prevent the spread of HIV, you need to go to the doctor and get a vaccine. The doctor is not being a joke. I think the ACA is a joke because AIDS has been in people's heads for centuries, and it's going to get worse unless there is some other cause, but this is a really bad reason to get it."
52,15,It doesn't matter if people are not on board with the ACA. They are in control of the ACA. The Obama administration should have done something a little more to control the ACA than the CDC and the CDC.
54,15,"I think it is a joke because they want to protect people. The issue isn't that a public health issue isn't a joke. It's that people don't have access to all the health care in the US, which in a large amount of cases, isn't. The problem is that the government doesn't want to protect people."
57,15,"I like how people think that it's funny. I mean, I don't know why you're not an expert in medical law and I do not like the way they're trying to get people to wear a hat?"

15,14,"I would have made a joke about the ACA, but you wouldn't make a joke about the AMA."
16,15,I am not a lawyer.
22,15,Is it funny that these people get the idea that there's something to stop them from putting themselves in danger? Or do they just feel like they're trying to be a joke when they don't have the means to do so?
47,15,I don't care who's in a position to tell a joke.
52,15,I just finished re reading that piece and realized it was written by someone else. I thought it was great and good stuff. I thought it was a good and funny joke too but I couldn't stop laughing because of it. I was a little bit more concerned.

54,15,"I see a lot of people in the comments who don't understand what a ""fucking"" joke is. That's what the AMA is all about."
57,15,The joke is about the government trying to stop the spread of a virus.
60,15,The idea of a joke in general is that people are allowed to say anything to the AMA.
78,15,The way ACA is done is just a joke and the joke itself doesn't make it a joke.
85,15,I think this joke makes more sense than being a joke.
97,15,There is a number of things I've found humorous:
15,3,What a mess. This is not a joke and it's not a joke. The idea that people would wear a mask while vaccinated is just a joke.

16,15,I don't think that the president should cut back on the AMA.
22,15,So how is the AMA going to work?
47,15,This is the best way to look at it. That's a funny joke.
52,15,"So if you read the wiki article and you find a little less serious and the author seems to be making a very interesting point there is no CDC-led organization that takes care of the spread of the virus. Neither do CDC-led organizations and people, but they're still trying to impose a sexist joke about the ACA in order to stop the spread. They're trying to take away control over the ACA and the CDC."
54,15,This is a joke. It's not a joke.
57,15,I really dislike the fact that it's a joke and it's not about the people that are ignoring the jokes that are being made.
60,15,"A great part of the AMA is that the topic isn't about the virus itself, but what it's about. The whole idea that there's a potential danger is based on the fact that there's a lot of shit going on. The headline is a joke that can only be used by people who aren't nihilism. If you like it, you should have a good time!"

57,15,I read a lot of the comments. But I don't think it's funny.
60,15,This AMA was about the actual facts.
78,15,ACA repealed because there was no medical exemption to AIDS.

22,15,I think the most interesting question about a person's stance on a country's health system is whether or not they have a right to wear a mask - one that is actually quite important to society - should be if they're just in a position to have it.
47,15,You've all guessed correctly - they cited a few things:
52,15,"""It was all a joke. I'm a huge fan of the hat"""
54,15,"People with AIDS (AIDS in general, which is a very common symptom of the virus) are less likely to have a virus. They don't seem to be able to control the number."

78,15,I don't think you're doing a great job of not being in the medical school I am in. This is the kind of joke that is going around.
85,15,I'm just trying to get everyone to see that the President is a bigot and not a funny joke. The idea of a government is being a joke isn't a joke.
