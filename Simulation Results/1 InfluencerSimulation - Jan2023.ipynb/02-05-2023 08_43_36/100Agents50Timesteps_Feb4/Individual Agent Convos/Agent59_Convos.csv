59,38,"It's a good way to get your mind out of your own head, though, so that you can get rid of the mask and stop the spread of a virus and prevent the virus from spreading further."
59,58,I think the first part is too bad it is also part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

74,59,I like the look of a mask and the smell of one

59,4,"As someone who has never been to Twitchcon, I'd have to say I'm not a fan of them, unless you don't like the ""whipped"" parts."
59,12,"I'm a huge anti-viral advocate, but I don't think that's true. I just think that it's a good way to get your mind out of your own head and not getting mad at the sane folks for not putting a mask on. Especially as a man of my word."
59,21,"You are not missing the point that you are describing. You are describing a specific issue - how do you get a virus to spread in a state that has laws about removing them? How does your state treat those that aren't. You have the right to decide which is the best solution. This is not something that is the best option for everyone, but it is also part of the policy. The mask and vaccines are different in each state, but that is still a valid concern for the state as an individual, and the best idea to make up for that."
59,37,"So the next episode of The New Yorker is about a woman who got a viral bite off of a woman's throat, and she died of a stroke? Is that true? It isn't."

68,59,> It is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.says the woman that wears the mask to protect herself
73,59,I had a hard time breathing because I couldn't put on a mask. I couldn't go to work because I didn't want to pay for the insurance because of my work related illness. I've been unable to sleep because of that and my partner's asthma. I couldn't get a job because I couldn't keep my eyes open.
74,59,i've always thought that people in sd were sick of twitchcon and twitchcon. i know not enough people who wear a mask
77,59,"I think it's a good idea for the school district to do it. That's pretty standard, in that most people do not. I'm gonna say it's the biggest one that I've ever heard and it's going to go viral in schools."
89,59,"This is a topic that should be brought up at any one time or another, right?"
90,59,One would think that the school was going to shut off their air ducts so that the fecal cords would be made of aluminum for a short period of time?
100,59,In Washington D.C. the mandates that are part of the measures deployed by the government are to keep people vaccinated and not spread viruses.
59,4,i thought the worst part of this was that people would always have the problem of not wearing a mask and that is why i think the most important thing to do is just put on a mask.
59,12,"The mask and vaccines are different in each state, but that is still a valid concern for the state as an individual, and the best idea to make up for that. This is a very difficult point to prove to a court that the public health order is being broken because of this, and that they should get more information about it."
59,21,Why is putting on a mask not a good idea?
59,37,"The CDC would be able to pull out of the schools and get them out, but there are laws in place to disallow all public use of public health equipment."
59,38,"As someone who has never been to Twitchcon, I'd have to say I'm not a fan of them, unless you don't like the ""whipped"" parts."
59,58,The idea of the mask is a lot more common in schools than it is in health insurance. The problem is that you are doing it to prevent people from getting sick in a controlled environment.
64,59,A liar. This was written by an unemployed citizen. It is an understatement that the school must have put on the mask to prevent any public health care related problems.
68,59,A man wearing a mask isn't a white person. He is a female. he is not a man.
73,59,It's ridiculous to me.
74,59,I haven't seen it but I do know a few things about sd. It's not like a large portion of the population actually wear masks. They are still mandatory.
77,59,"Aye, if they can't wear a mask, the school board is going to get mad because it's a huge political issue and the school board can't get mad at the school board."
89,59,Do you really like being with the doctor? It would be a good idea if he could make someone who has had a mask go through some sort of antiviral medication.
90,59,... And I'm surprised that the only reason for those who didn't vote against the ACA were people who didn't vote for the one that was in a community of people who support their choice.
100,59,You know it? You're gonna get a little mad at them.
59,4,I'm glad people don't wear masks anymore in my state.
59,12,"Why are you so worried about a doctor's decision, or that this will be an issue if it's the teacher's choice, or the state's decision, or the entire country's choice?"
59,21,A man with a mask is an unemployed citizen.
59,37,"The CDC has a legal obligation to get rid of these kinds of public health equipment. I don't know what they say, but the school board is being able to get mad because of this, and the school board is... not being able to get mad."
59,38,... and it's a big red flag.
59,58,The one in the link is all of that info.
64,59,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. OP, 'No mask' or 'No mask'? ', 'No mask', 'No mask'? ''."
68,59,"In the movie ""The Black Panthers"" it says that ""The black Panthers"" are the first team to go through the XII to be president."
73,59,"I think he was trying to convince people that a'meat allergy' is somehow an excuse to wear a mask, but that that isn't enough to make a ""right"" decision. This isn't what he's attempting to say in a joking manner, which is ridiculous to me."
74,59,"> If you want to get mad at someone that doesn't wear a mask, you have to do something about it. If you don’t want to, you should probably get rid of it. Are you sure you don’t want to wear a mask, and be in a party he doesn’t support, and a candidate he has already met."
77,59,I'm pretty sure that's what the teacher said. They are not required to wear a mask. That's ridiculous.
89,59,I think it's a good idea.
90,59,>Is the issue with the mask in your city really that difficult to work out? Is it is my responsibility to do my own thing.
100,59,I think you are being conservative. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
59,4,Is the issue with the mask in your city really that difficult to work out? Is it is my responsibility to do my own thing.
59,12,I think it's quite obvious that this is a big red flag.
59,21,"He is being a bit of a narcissist, and apparently he is talking about his personal health, which is something that is so common in people who would be in the position to 'put on a mask.'"
59,37,"This is a common theme in the United States of America: ""Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. It's ridiculous to me. I haven't seen it but I do know a few things about sd. It's not like a large portion of the population actually wear masks. They are still mandatory."
59,38,I think it's a good idea to make the mask a temporary issue. Putting a mask on your face will help the state not have to go through the full cost of the mask to keep it in place.
59,58,This is the best way to handle this problem.
64,59,"I like to see people get on the fucking reddit front page, but that is not enough to get them to do it. I'm a small town in Georgia and I don't want to be the only one trying to do it."
68,59,"If it wasn't for the fact that he was wearing a mask because he had a gun, he would have had to wear a hoodie. The joke is just ridiculous, and I don't see anything else that makes sense."

I feel like the only good thing about a mask is that it makes a lot of people uncomfortable in their room, so it becomes like the ol''fucking shit."
77,59,...and I’ve always thought this is something that’s a bit of a fucking joke.
89,59,"I'm not talking about the whole ""I think it's a good idea"" thing, but the fact that you're asking for a question about ""why would you want to be in a medical emergency and wear a mask"" that makes you think he can make a point of that makes the question ""why would you want to be in a medical emergency and wear a mask?"""

59,37,We can say that all the kids in the school are now wearing masks in public buildings. The problem is a lot of people have been trying to do something like this for over 10 years.

64,59,I don't know if it would be more of a problem if the school wasn't in it. I think it could be a problem with some school allowing the kids to wear masks at school - you can't change their clothing.
68,59,"It sounds like they are using a mask to get the ""fuck out of this."""

59,37,What's crazy is the public school board can't even get the schools to stop using them because of a virus outbreak. This is a huge problem for many reasons. It's pretty obvious that this is not a good idea and it sounds like it's a silly idea.

73,59,This is the exact joke that the EPA is using in its first article.
74,59,So the President wears his mask in public when he goes to his office? I’m not sure why anybody’s point being made.
77,59,I think you are on to something.
89,59,"If you wear a mask on your hand that doesn't make it contagious, then you are a nutjob."

59,21,A woman's right to be in the position to see the president without a mask is the same as an invitation to a party fundraiser or political event.
59,37,This is the most crappy and stupid idea I've heard in a long time.
59,38,The problem isn't the fact that the ACA is being used to prevent outbreaks of viruses or how it should be used. It's that they are being used in order to stop a specific outbreak. The mask & vaccines aren't even legal anymore. They're not going to stop the spread of a virus.
59,58,The ACA has the potential to be a big deal for sure.
64,59,(https://www.neah.gov.ca/neah/).
68,59,"So, the point of the mask is to prevent the spread of a virus? I'm sorry but I'm not sure if it's a joke that's all that funny, or if it's just a joke because it's just one of the things the president wants people to remember."
73,59,"It's one thing to be very angry and be defensive, but it's another thing to be angry and be naive."
74,59,You should look up the CDC’s statement on this subject.
77,59,If the teachers can't support a ban on it they can't change their policy. If they have a problem with it they can.
89,59,i like to think that you're trying to bring this up and not being serious
90,59,"It's a little more than that. You know that's just one part of a larger issue: It's more than just a ""shit story,"" it's that the problem is the fact that the law is in place, but the problem is that people still have to vote against it because they think that it is better for everyone."
100,59,I didn't read it to be fair.
59,4,I think the biggest problem with that is the lack of evidence proving that the mask is not contagious.
59,12,"The first part of the title — 'Why are you so worried about a doctor's decision, or that this will be an issue if it's the teacher's choice, or the entire country's choice?' — doesn't contain much information about the whole issue."

59,38,I have no idea what to make of this.
59,58,"The point of a mask isn't preventing any disease, it's stopping the spread of infection."

100,59,"I’m getting a bit old and getting old, but I know that I’m in my mid-20s. The twitchcon movement has been trying to get me off the rails.

59,4,No. We're talking about the same thing. And then we put on a mask.
59,12,"It sounds like you're on to something. I'm in my 20's and I've got a lot of experience in this sub. I've found it to be an amazing opportunity to be an effective public health advocate, but it's hard to think that the school district can't get anything out of it in my city."
59,21,"Assuming the CDC is correct, it's not just a joke, but the kind of joke you're describing in the title."
59,37,It's kind of like the twitchcon movement that makes an entire subreddit full of stupid and ridiculous comments and stuff that isn't relevant to their own agenda.
59,38,The government is trying to force you to be in a town that is not safe. They're trying to convince you that if you don't go to the hospital the mask is the best thing for you to do.

77,59,It's not a joke. They don't want to change it. The problem isn't a joke. It's a joke.
89,59,The problem lies with how we treat people and how we deal with the effects.
90,59,I'm pretty sure it's a movie starring Paul Mendoza that is a skunk-friendly one.

59,4,"""I feel like the only good thing about a mask is that it makes a lot of people uncomfortable in their room, so it becomes like the ol''fucking shit.''"
59,12,There are many questions here. The government is trying to force you to be in Texas and to keep your hands lubricated for years. The CDC has a lot of serious issues involving this but it's a really interesting topic.
59,21,"i'm not a doctor, but as a skunk a good bit of a narcissist that can talk about health."
59,37,"As someone who lived in Texas before I was 18, I would be curious how a trump-themed movie is."

74,59,I am the president. I am an adult. I am not the president.
77,59,>It’s a joke. But I just think it’s a joke.
89,59,> I am not a big fan of Obamacare.
90,59,That’s not exactly a skunk-friendly movie. The idea of the movie is that the skunks who are in their school would be sick and nauseous if their fecal cords were made of aluminum.
100,59,"I'm not an expert on the subject, but I can understand why they are calling them ""lawful."" The reason that they are trying to end them is that they are trying to make them all out of something they are."
