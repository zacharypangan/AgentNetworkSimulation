101,53,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
53,5,Its not illegal. Its illegal to wear a mask when you're in public and get fired.
53,7,When you wear a mask or get the jab you have to scream for the other guy's life to stop them from coughing.
53,8,They ruined the economy. People deserve to get to choose.
53,19,"Then, when they start to change their regulations, we will see the difference."
53,27,"They're basically a law that states it can be revoked, so the government can't do it unless they know."
53,30,I would rather not be wearing a mask than a jab for a very long time.
53,33,Those are the two issues that you should be wary of.
53,39,"No, no! You can't stop the virus. The government is ignoring it."
53,41,No I think that s just the fucking nonsense that's going on here.
53,43,It's just not worth it.
53,47,There are also lots of pathetic guys that slam dunk the masks as a way of working.
54,53,"I've always heard the phrase. ""I wear my mask when I m in public lawmaker who isn t wearing his mask in public says"""
65,53,That's the question I'm arguing about. I think you need to think about how we'll stop a virus if we don't wear masks.
66,53,"You've had it already? You've already had it? You don't have to. You can't stop a virus from spreading anywhere, but you can't stop a virus from spreading all over the country. Those are only the last few instances where the flu spreads by force, because they aren't effective."
83,53,I'd rather not play and have to go somewhere with a helmet.
97,53,"You just don't have the courage to tell this a story. We will have to wait for that to happen, but he can put a mask on his face."
101,53,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
53,5,People are going to get fired. It's the worst. It's not the best. It's the worst. It's the worst. It's the best. It's not the best. It's the worst.
53,7,"That's a really tough sentence for me. I've been trying to remember the name of the guy who used to teach people to have a face mask. And you? You know that the only fucking reason they can't put on face masks is because it sucks, right?"
53,8,I'm not against vacks mandates.
53,19,I don't think the mask will stop the flu and I don't think it's an issue that's been discussed with any professional or academic players about it.
53,27,"They're basically a law that states it can be revoked, so the government can't do it unless they know."
53,30,"Yeah, that's a good one. And yeah, I think it s ridiculous, but I think that if we are to stop the spread of the virus, we need to be ready for the next phase."
53,33,A very recent article in the Guardian notes that the government is ignoring all sorts of facts.
53,39,"I'm just not familiar with these words, and there's a great deal of confusion over them."
53,41,Honestly I'd rather not wear a mask and if I ever had one on I'd just sit there and talk.
53,43,It is a good idea to wear your mask when you are in public and getting fired. It could also be a good idea to wear a mask to stop the virus from spreading all over the country.
53,47,I like this one. I'm going to have to try and explain my reasoning here.
54,53,I feel like I've got a lot of friends who hate the idea of being told to wear a mask while they play.
65,53,"I think that ""wearing a mask"" is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
66,53,I can tell you from experience the very best way to stop the spread of a virus is to go to the police. I am not against them.

101,53,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
53,5,This article is actually just some omissions from the US Department of Health and Human Services' recent report on the effectiveness of anti-virus vaccines.
53,7,You need to make an exception to all the restrictions on the wear of face masks. That's just a rule you can't change. There is a reason not to wear face masks. It's more that you have to wear a mask to prevent people from catching the flu. It's not a rule of thumb if you do something illegal to prevent it from spreading.
53,8,I don't understand why anyone would want to wear a face mask. I just feel like it would get you fired if the government could do a bit more.
53,19,"We need to have more people who understand the government's role in the spread of the virus. If we start to get rid of the weed, eh?"
53,27,"It is so much easier to have a face mask and the way you eat a piece of meat, and you're going to have to wear a mask."
53,30,That's a good one.
53,33,"> I want to not play and have to go somewhere with a helmet. You just don't have the courage to tell this a story. We will have to wait for that to happen, but he can put a mask on his face."
53,39,Your friend should go ahead and go to the police with their questions.

65,53,"I’m not going to agree with the rest of your comment, but I think wearing a mask to stop the spread of a virus is absolutely useless."
66,53,I think it is really great the government will make this change and let the people who want it go.
83,53,A lot of shit is pumped into the huddles of huddles and I can't stand to look at it from behind my back.
97,53,"It was not a stupid thing to do on a map of the US. It isn't a reasonable thing to do. And that's why we call it the racial ""religion"" thing. There aren't millions of people who would actually want to go to a real world government for help and it's not a good thing."
101,53,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."

53,8,"If your friend is the only one who is against vaccinations or the 'vaccination' and has the time, the government should make a stop to the outbreaks. That's because they don't want people to have to wear a mask, they want people to be able to choose what they want and who to not eat food. It's just not a rule."
53,19,I've had to wear a mask once. I didn't want to go to the police in the first place. I just found the first sentence in that sub to be completely uninformed.
53,27,">I don't know what to say about the mask issue, but if I want to go to the police with their questions, I'm going to be totally honest with you about the mask issue."

53,41,I think it is a little too early to tell. Is this what the health departments should be doing?
53,43,"I think you can't get a lot of people to really support this type of change, and don't feel like you're expressing any sense of sympathy. It sounds like there is something wrong with these people. That's one thing they're doing and the other is bringing up the truth, and not giving a shit, 'Cannonanist'.

54,53,"I'm not being facetious. I mean, I've heard a lot of things about it. And that's an awfully broad definition of contagious. That's why I think it's a big deal. I was in a position where a person wanted to wear a mask in public, and a person who did not believe that a person could wear a mask in public would not, because it would make a bad point. I don't like the idea of having to wear a mask outside or in your car and a sword are two words"
65,53,"It's really a shame that you don't understand what ""Vacks mandates"" are. I mean, they are what the government is all about, and it's not necessarily a bad thing, because they're used as a way to make people feel less uncomfortable. That doesn't make them feel better."
66,53,"The ""I'm not against"" part is misleading and misleading. Is the government trying to push a thwarted, expensive system that isn't gonna fix it?"
83,53,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

53,7,I think that's the thing to think. It seems like the government wants to stop people from becoming sick to give people a choice.

53,43,The first paragraph sounds really sexist and insulting to you. That's really the most egregious part of it.
53,47,Why don't the public be more concerned about how people get sick in public? They don't want to be hurt and need to see a doctor.
54,53,I love people who are in the public sector. I'm surprised that the only reason for those who didn't vote against the ACA were people who didn't vote for the one that was in a community of people who support their choice.

53,43,"They are trying to change the constitution to stop the spread of AIDS. I don't think they are a joke. I don't think there is a good reason to get away from it if it means that people can't get rid of it.

53,47,"People can't care how the government treats themselves, but it's just another way of avoiding some of their most damaging threats. The government would be worse off without the protections they would have had to make. It's a nice way of saying it's a bad thing."

53,47,It's a joke because I don't like the jokes.
54,53,"It's a joke that sounds a lot like ""What are the benefits of vaccination, and how they could be used to spread the disease? The whole point of the ACA is that it is not really a joke, but it's just an attempt to prevent a spreading of a virus."""
65,53,"There's actually a whole section about this, but it isn't exactly ""the joke"" at all."
66,53,It's about the mask. But the idea of it's a joke is not about the money. It's about a mask that you can buy to stop the spread of a virus.
83,53,i don't understand why people are going to be more defensive than they're aware.
97,53,I know someone in the government who thinks they are racist. And I don't think it would be possible for him to turn himself in on a mask.
101,53,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
53,5,"Honestly, the ACA is one of the most controversial laws that have been passed - 'I'm not gonna put on a mask because I'm not getting a diagnosis '- i just don't know what it means."
53,7,"If I remember correctly, you have to be very careful if you don't wear face masks to keep infected."
53,8,This is why it's so much more insensitive than the AMA.

53,27,"HA! Yeah, this is really a joke! This is how you end it all. You don't even need a mask to stop it, and you have no idea what you're doing here."
53,30,"I can't understand what you're saying. I'm not against the ACA, I think you're just saying it is a joke."
53,33,"This is a joke, not a joke. I have a bit of the same question, but just a bit different, because you haven't heard anything about it. Then again, I'm not anti-vaccination."
53,39,"So what are some things that you think are funny, or at least humorous?"
53,41,"No. The President's response to a recent thread stating that ""we do not need a mask to stop the spread of a virus."" This is a joke."
53,43,"> The AMA isn't a joke, it's a joke."
53,47,The Obama Administration is a joke and this is how the joke started. The Obama administration was making jokes about that. People aren't indifferent to it because they are so much less intelligent.

66,53,A man who has been diagnosed with HIV and asked about the government's role in helping tackle the AIDS epidemic. It seems that it's not an obvious thing.
83,53,"Yes, that is the whole point of a mask. The point of a mask is to prevent HIV from spreading in a public place and in a private home environment. I've been to a few events without a mask. That's all I've had. Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of a virus. In fact, the whole idea of a mask is absurd. The issue is that if someone has HIV, they will have to get their vaccine. If they have to get their vaccine, then they're not a joke."
97,53,That's a pretty funny way to look at it. The joke that is being made by the President is very very different from the joke of Donald J. Trump's. It's a joke about how a lot of people in this sub are making fun of the President and he is defending his shit. This is just an example of people getting too tired of people being joked and depressed over how the President is so clearly white.
101,53,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
53,5,This isn't a joke.
53,7,"The jokes of the President are actually about the fact that they're being called a joke, in which it's not about a joke. They're about the fact that it doesn't affect people's health, because people are looking for a reason to be so scared that they can't get a better chance of getting HIV than to avoid them and their parents."
53,8,The president said they would take a lot of abuse when they were discussing the ACA.
53,19,"They are not actually a joke, they are trying to push for anti-virus legislation."
