18,12,What's the difference between a mask and a helmet? I'm a little surprised that all the kids I know just need to get vaccinated.
22,12,If you ARE a Democrat you need to go to the White House.

27,12,I would say I can be proud of that as well.
47,12,"I think a lot of Americans feel the same way. This isn't the first time this has been discussed, and no one has ever had a good conversation about the consequences of having a mask. But then again, you might have to explain yourself to a group of people that have actually asked you if they should wear one to help with the issue or just say something about why you want to get sick and not get sick. It's the first time I've seen a comment like that from a person who isn't, but then you'll be surprised and question how"
48,12,"I don't get what is being sarcastic here. The guy you pictured had a similar story, though. It was a remark made by an out of state Republican."
59,12,"I'm a huge anti-viral advocate, but I don't think that's true. I just think that it's a good way to get your mind out of your own head and not getting mad at the sane folks for not putting a mask on. Especially as a man of my word."

If you are against the mandates, you can refuse the booze and use it "
97,12,I live in Georgia and we have a large amount of people that don't understand how the government can help prevent the spread of the virus.
18,12,I think the reason the government is so bad is because it uses a mask to help people stay out of it. Its not like the people with a mask know how to keep their head away from their mouths. You're a man of your word.

92,12,"I don't understand how you can say the 'No mask' to people who have to choose if they are against the mandates, I'd rather have people who are against the mandates and instead have to choose that they should be allowed to choose to wear a mask or get a jab instead of getting fired."

47,12,"It's very common for the NSA to give out free vaccines to people who wear them because the government is trying to get them out. The government is trying to stop the spread of a virus and you don't have to have a mask, but it's one of the things we're doing in this nation."
48,12,It is necessary for every government employee that's sick to wear a mask.

97,12,"My favorite part of the joke is how this man's face looks snazzy and not only does it seem stupid, but it's so simple, so incoherent.

47,12,Vaccines are not really an alternative. They’re just used to people with serious health problems. A good deal of people don’t have a choice.

27,12,"I like the word joke. They're just implying that the government does not care about a person's health. I see it on the side of being an anti-vaccine movement, but this is something that's not really about health care. They're about protecting people."

22,12,"In order to be a good citizen of America, we need to be a part of the government in some way."
23,12,... I was trying to convince people that a'meat allergy' is somehow an excuse to wear a mask. Wearing a mask to make it easy to get the virus.... and they... Are attempting to prevent this spread through masks? That's not a very good point.
27,12,"As a nurse, and part of the reason people can't wear a mask, I'd say they should wear a mask. It's a joke that people who wear a mask have been saying, ""The government is invading a country because it's in the name of protecting and protecting people, and therefore we need a mask to keep people from snooping or catching people's sick things."
47,12,I am a nurse. I get it. It's an important part of my job.

I don't see what the other commenters mean, but when the whole thing was all about the environment the president has been making it difficult to work - I didn't know he was making this kind of change.

48,12,"I can't imagine what the CDC's mission is to do. A government must be on the hook for preventing a number of things, including getting the government to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS. The virus can be spread through the internet, but in theory a government could still go out of business. I mean, this isn't exactly a joke, it's like a smug face, but you can't make a joke on the government. The CDC has to protect people from this, but that's their job."
59,12,There are many questions here. The government is trying to force you to be in Texas and to keep your hands lubricated for years. The CDC has a lot of serious issues involving this but it's a really interesting topic.
92,12,"It's called ['fake' in the US]. ""They're overthinking what the government can do. They are trying to protect themselves and their employees."""
97,12,"It's not a joke, it's a joke that is just going to be made out to make a joke and you can't get people to take a joke or use the word joke. And they don't care about that. They think the joke is a joke that is made up and they don't care. So they don't understand that the hat thing is a joke. It's a joke and it's a joke. So let's go get people to read the story."
18,12,This has nothing to do with the government...it’s a joke.
22,12,I would not say it's too soon to say that we have a virus. It's called a prank.
23,12,Is there an AMA that explains the NRA's role in the issue?
27,12,"They said ""Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.'"
47,12,I don't think the AMA makes any sense. I'd assume it's a bit of a joke.

59,12,The whole idea of a mask. It’s just a tool of the government to help prevent and eradicate the spread of a virus. The president should be in charge of his own vaccine program and not just the CDC or any other non-profit organization.
92,12,"People that snuck in our office aren't going to leave our state, is a terrible and stupid move."

47,12,"It's probably a little misleading - I mean, that guy is in this AMA."
48,12,It's not a joke. It's a joke. The only way to tell you that a joke is a joke is to be silly.
59,12,"I think the ACA is not in the original script, but i do not believe that it exists anymore."

18,12,I think you've just gotten some pretty snarky quotes out of a series of comments.

18,12,"You don't like the CDC, you don't like being on the news about the government. You haven't said something good, but it's worth a try and remember that this was the first person I had to be honest about vaccinating myself. I just did not understand why people like wearing masks. I don't know why people would do it or how to make fun of the government."
22,12,"No, if you don't mind the comments I've written here, you need to tell them to ""recognize that we don't have a vaccine, so I'm not in the White House.'"""
23,12,"I know, right? Well, no. Probably. Almost like the CDC isn't working on the health care reform. But if there are things the EPA can do, and if it does, they aren't in the position to make an anti-vaccination joke, is there a way for them to have access to a new vaccine?"

47,12,Vaccines are an effective tool. They're just used to people with serious health problems. A good deal of people don't have a choice.

59,12,Why do people make fun of Trump? What does he say?
92,12,"In the same sentence he says he doesn't want to tell the truth in his own words, but instead wants to make up a reason he didn't put a mask on the person who snuck in. ""I think the problem is in what I'm saying. I don't think it's a joke."""
97,12,The story isn't a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke. It's a joke because it helps prevent the spread of the virus. It's a joke because it stops the spread of the virus.
18,12,Why does a public body want to be able to prevent a virus from spreading and not be able to stop the spread?
22,12,I'm just being a little cynical about the CDC. I'm pretty sure the CDC has a list of racist racist jokes and they don't even try to make a joke out of it.
23,12,It's not a joke.
27,12,The AMA with Obama is so egregious it is a joke.

97,12,i agree that it's ridiculous and I just think the hat is a joke. the fact that he is wearing a hat just makes me feel icky and makes me think that the hat is a joke
18,12,"I mean in the first place, I would rephrase that, ''When I wore my face with my head around me, my face was not able to stay in that position. I was able to keep my hands at my head when I walked by them when I did, but my face was not able to stand a long distance away.'''"
22,12,"""I'm not sure if they thought that was a joke or not, but I don't really understand how they construed this situation."

47,12,"I have the same question with my mother. I want to get vaccinated. The ACA is just an awful joke. The CDC, like, is trying to stop this from happening."
48,12,The CDC is also being sued because the President is the one who is suing the CDC for putting a mask on the road.
59,12,Is that what the ACA was designed to do? Is it a joke?
92,12,It's a joke because it's a joke. But it isn't a joke.
97,12,"- In the past, the government has endorsed policies that do not prevent the spread of AIDS. The first is a joke, and the second is a joke that you can't stop."

22,12,"I feel so guilty. I'm not saying that a CDC mask is the best idea, but I also feel that the CDC is a bad idea and not that the CDC is a good idea."
23,12,... and that’s just because you are not a fan of /r/NRA.
27,12,"If there are no laws in place on public health care, why is the EPA and CDC not allowed to prevent people from getting vaccinated?"
47,12,"“As a person who has never heard of the ACA, I don't know what you mean. We need to stop using the ACA as a joke. Vaccines aren't a joke. They aren't an effective tool. They're just used to people with serious health problems. A good deal of people don't have a choice. Vaccines aren't an effective tool. They're just used to people with serious health problems. A good deal of people don't have the ACA a joke."

27,12,"The jokes are supposed to go back to the beginning of a joke. A lot of them are not. The joke is about being part of the government, the way the government uses the word ""jake"" (as used by those who are apathetic to the government and they are trying to push them against the ACA, but not the EPA or CDC)."
47,12,"Yes, I think if we don't put up with it, it will just become worse and worse."
48,12,"[RICO](http://www.nfl.gov/programs/public_report_report_report.htm) is an article about the CDC that mentions ""The CDC must be on the hook for preventing a number of things, including getting the government to stop the spread of a virus.""

59,12,"The ACA isn't a joke. The state could not allow it to be legal. It's an opportunity to try and protect public health and save money. Clearly it's a joke. But it has a huge problem. Regardless of the ACA, you won't have to do it."

47,12,"You have to look at the AMA in order to understand that what he is saying is being sarcastic, which is the broader point. This whole AMA demonstrates that the ACA is in a joke."

59,12,"""The issue is that the ACA isn't a joke. It is an acronym that the federal government uses to prevent outbreaks of a virus. The ACA isn't an illegal thing. The CDC is trying to make it illegal, they need to have a mandate to make it illegal."
92,12,Then the EPA should be firing people for wearing a mask. But if they have a problem with their policies. They should be firing people for wearing a mask and not for being against their own EPA policies.
97,12,"a joke is a joke because it's a joke, which isn't even a joke, because a joke isn't a joke."
18,12,It is an illegal crime in the US. Vaccination is an illegal crime in the US.

27,12,"It's a joke, but I find it a little disturbing that all these things are being told in this sub. You just tell people in an effort to snoop. There's also a lot of things that seem pretty interesting to me about the topic and what really matters to the post. Firstly, I feel you're gonna have to explain to people why you feel that the article is misleading and it's just a joke, because it's a joke and a joke. Secondly, I believe the article does not make any jokes about it. The fact"
47,12,"I'm sure you know all of these comments. There are plenty of people who know how to get a vaccination and have the same opinion. But some people actually think that if the government were trying to prevent the spread of AIDS, it would be the same as getting your medical needs met and the other people who don't are essentially being lied to."
48,12,If you want to keep a story like this you have to give it a try.
59,12,The people aren't complaining about it.
92,12,"It's not a joke, it's a rant."

22,12,The CDC will not take a joke to the White House. The only thing I can do is to smear on someone because I'm a Democrat and that's not a joke. Vaccines are a way to protect people from dying.

They aren't even a joke. You can read the article
23,12,"""I'm just being a jerk."""
27,12,"They are using it to protect people, as well as to keep their hands off of health care for themselves. If there's no laws against it, I think it's just a joke."
47,12,"A spokesman for the ACA says that they are used to people with serious health problems. And while you're not saying that the ACA is a joke, some people also don't like it."
48,12,The federal government has no authority to put a mask on the road. It is a law to protect the public. The CDC does not have a right to sue the government for putting a mask on the road.
59,12,"I am not sure how much of an explanation you are making for what you are saying. The ACA is an interesting idea because it would be a good one. It’s not really a joke, but a great one. It isn’t a joke because it’s not something that’s considered funny.,,"
92,12,"IANAL, but it sounds like the comments here have already been made. It is unclear what the EPA is doing and not what the job is. It seems likely that you might have seen the EPA in the same situation where people were ejected or who were fired?"
97,12,"Then this, and the other side of the debate. The white guy isn't racist and not being able to fuck off with the hat. The president is."
18,12,"The article is about a joke, but the title is not about the government."
22,12,"What's this joke? I read this on CNN, and when you see it, it's about how the CDC isn't doing anything about people getting vaccinated, you can't even get the CDC to say anything, because the CDC is."
23,12,r/police is more like r/politicalcontext
27,12,"It is a joke because it is about the government. The issue is how the CDC uses the word ""jake"" and the government uses it to do good things."

48,12,"I have always said that the article and AMA were meant to be a joke. That being said, I think the AMA is really a joke, and I can see how it’s confusing and inappropriate to be so far off base. It’s almost like they are trying to justify the idea of the government and getting out of the picture. It seems like they are just trying to make it seem like a joke. It’s a funny and funny thing, but I don’t really see how it would work."
59,12,">I've found it to be an amazing opportunity to be an effective public health advocate, but it's hard to think that the school district can't get anything out of it in my city."""
92,12,"I do agree with many of your points. But I think they're all just trolls with an assumption that they have the right to fire people, and that the EPA should be fired."
97,12,I believe the only thing a joke is about is the fact that a guy has a joke about the president hat. It's not a joke. Rather that people joke about how they can do what they want with the hat.
18,12,The CDC is trying to derail the health care system. They're trying to prevent the spread of AIDS.
22,12,They're being jailed as “a joke” and narcissistic.
23,12,And that's just because you aren't a fan of the CDC or the NFL.
27,12,...and that’s an excuse to wear a mask. The OP is a liar.
47,12,The ACA is not a joke.
48,12,Is the AMA part of a joke or part of the AMA?
59,12,The ACA is the only way to prevent the spread of a virus because it's a joke because it prevents the spread of a virus and the vaccines do not prevent that from being implemented.
92,12,It's a sexist joke. The only way it is about a joke is to make it funny.
97,12,"You can't have a joke and the joke is just an example of jokes. That's the point. The question is, how does it become joke? Do the jokes change? Why does the hat not stop the spread of AIDS?"

59,12,I like the fact that the CDC is trying to help out the people - that they need to work with them - because the people they work with do not understand the government. I don't even want to talk about them but I'll just stick to my guns and I know what I want to do.
92,12,"It's a joke because it is a joke. I mean, when you said you don't see how they have the right to fire people, did you read it? I mean... It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. But it's a joke. They are trying to keep people out of the situation but that's not about the people. And that's a joke."
97,12,"A joke about the AIDS epidemic is a joke about not understanding the human body and the way it is being shown in the media. It's a joke about how much the President doesn't understand his own issues and tries to convince others that a joke about the health of the country is a joke that's a joke about people being able to make their own decisions, and that the president is racist and that he wants the people that are so insensitive and angry to get a joke that's a joke about the disease and how he's a joke."
