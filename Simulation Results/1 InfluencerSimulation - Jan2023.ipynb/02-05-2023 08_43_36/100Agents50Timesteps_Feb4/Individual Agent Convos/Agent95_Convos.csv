95,29,"So I've written about this before. If it makes you feel better, maybe you should also consider what the 'happiness' is: a lot of the people describing 'infectious' people can equate to what the person was infected with and it has nothing to do with the virus, but with the threat of something. Then there's the 'happiness' of not wanting to be infected, and with a willingness to be a part of a group. But I do not know how they are doing that. 'Haha"
