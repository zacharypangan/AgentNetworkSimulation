16,1,"Well I have some questions, and i need to get over that."
16,15,"In the US, wear a mask to prevent infections. Wear a mask to help prevent infection. It is an essential precaution to get your health at the highest possible levels, and it is a good way to ensure you have plenty of safety."
18,16,"I don't really care what it says but I agree with the others, it's useless and I hate it. I mean, this isn't just about me... it's about all the laws that they have to have about being able to work with people who are incapable of working without permission of some other person."
29,16,"So, you wore a mask for an event that was scheduled to begin on January 1st, 1923. Then, after that you would have to rip out your vest, or use your head as a shield and take off the mask to the hospital?"
31,16,So in a world with less than 20 million people worldwide...
41,16,I would wear a mask if I did get shot :)
52,16,My brother and I have never read the book so i can hardly imagine being with a man who wore the mask despite being a politician
55,16,[This article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's Mask) is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
60,16,A guy in California in the 80's was wearing his mask to protest the invasion of Haiti. That was his only inauguration day. I'm still pretty sure this was all his first real election.
61,16,If it doesn't have mandates I'm sorry i'm leaving..
72,16,See this is how crazy trump s made the united states of america if you want order in america president donald j trump must take off his mask and turn himself in oh and every day he doesn t people will die starting tonight i m a man of my word covid
78,16,i do not know if i could do a better job if i wear a mask
84,16,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.oh man you should come to georgia it s like people here think wearing a mask gives them covid there s so few oh man you should come to georgia it s like people here think wearing a mask gives them covid there s so few
85,16,Watch out for the zombies. They have to live for two years.
92,16,I m not against vacks mandates at all. I just want to let people wear a mask or get a jab.
16,1,>How does the mask make his breath come out of the back of his head oh man you should come to Georgia
16,15,It sounds like your brother and I both have very different views of the subject.
18,16,>I don't think wearing a mask outside or in your car alone is good for your mental health. I think wearing a mask outside or in your car alone is better than going outside alone.
29,16,The first part of the sentence is very obnoxious. I find it so interesting how his attempt at protecting the public is so strong and so eloquent. Is he supposed to be a man of wit?
31,16,"This is what I've been taught about the word ""distraction"" and this is what I've learned as a young man (at the age of 23 and over 30), I learned a hard lesson about the word ""distraction"" and my dad made a huge mistake and now I hate it."
41,16,This is the post that prompted me to post this. It has a lot of stuff going on.
52,16,>I believe it was the a mask. It's a mask.
55,16,It's a good thing that people wear masks and we can protect ourselves from this kind of danger.
60,16,"As a Georgian who enjoys a bit of the sexism I've got to say it's an incredibly sexist way to take my hair - I've only ever seen it in my face. It's like saying that someone who doesn't wear a mask will have a very hard time in a situation where she's actually in a sexism mood - but she's not doing it because she doesn't want to, and that is why people should put sexism first. That's not"
61,16,"If you're vaccinated with a vaccine and don't like them, why aren't you allowed to wear the mask when you can't do that?"
72,16,RIP you scumbag. You've just been dragged to a show.
78,16,"So I guess I'm not being sarcastic because this thread isn't a joke, but just that I've seen a phd student get a mask to stop the spread of a virus."
84,16,That is a really scary fucking question What can I say about the federal government?
85,16,The video for the video is a little bit of an extreme and not very good. I have read that people like wearing a mask in public places when they want to wear them. I have read that some people like wearing a mask in public places when they want to wear them.
92,16,There are two kinds of people.
16,1,Exactly what you say. Exactly what you say. I've seen him get a mask as a kid.
16,15,Yes it is. The mask is a good thing. They can protect themselves against the sexism. It is also good for people to prevent it.
18,16,The only real difference between the two I can think of is that they've been doing this for a long time. You've got your problems fixed. It's like the only reason they've ever tried to do it. You're being told the only way to help is by having someone who can't do it for you. I see what you mean and just keep trying.
29,16,"OP, this is the first time i've heard a quote about the ""Making a mask"" issue. This is about the government's attempt to cut the budget to prevent people from spreading the virus."
31,16,You've been under the impression that this guy was a police officer who made the wrong call.
41,16,This is an extremely relevant issue. I think you should probably consider restraining orders and how to handle this.
52,16,I don't like the idea of a man wearing a mask for the flu.
55,16,"In the US, the word ""fake"" comes from ""fake."""
60,16,"Honestly, I don't think that the joke is true. It's a joke. It's a joke. I wouldn't wear a mask if it weren't for the virus and it's not a joke. It's just a joke."
61,16,I think the whole reason that they're not allowed to do this is because the government is not doing something to stop people from dying from the virus.
72,16,"I have a bunch of questions here. Firstly, what is the 'I like you' part of the meme? What is the 'I hate you' part of the meme?"
78,16,I can't get past the fact that you're not a fan of the one-handed government policy.
84,16,"I think the second sentence would be a bit better than a sarcastic one where the title is 'Oh man you should come to Georgia it s like people here think wearing a mask gives them covid there s so few oh man you should come to Georgia it s like people here think wearing a mask gives them covid there s so few', 'That is a really scary fucking question What can I say about the federal government?'"
85,16,I'm a little nervous but I really think he's being sarcastic.
92,16,"I don't think you should be fired because you can refuse to wear a mask or get a jab. You could try to justify your actions in this way, which is what the rest of the article is about. But the article says this: I don't think a mask is what is important to me. I think it's just one example of the problem that exists. The problem isn't the state. EPA is an outside agency, not a government. There isn't enough evidence to argue that a public nuisance, especially hacked computer, is a"
16,1,"In the US, the word ""fake"" comes from ""fake."""
16,15,"This isn't an election issue, but a fact of life and the government's attempt to cut its budget to prevent people from spreading viruses."
18,16,I've just come out of my mid 50s.
29,16,I think it's a really clever idea to wear a mask outside on some job that is very tight but has a lot of health benefits.
31,16,"A police officer is a scumbag. If the cop is scumbag, you should have a copy of your report."
41,16,>I'm a big fan of this kind of thing.
52,16,"That's a really terrible example. I just hate it when people wear the word ""shit"" on other people, because it's not good for them, it's horrible. It's not really bad. It's the worst kind of insult."
55,16,There are many benefits to wearing a mask.
60,16,Why is the CDC working on it?
61,16,Apparently you can't wear a mask in the United States.
72,16,"I love people, I hope he will become a president sometime soon."
78,16,>I think that the one-handed government policy that is implementing in the US is to allow people to have a helmet in public.
84,16,"''That is a really scary fucking question, and that's not the right answer. I think that a lot of the skepticism that comes with the federal government's approach to protecting health care should be put to rest."
85,16,"A government official. A CIA agent in the US, that specializes in preventing the spread of a disease, and was arrested and charged in August of '98 for wearing a mask. The federal government is investigating it and is still working on it."
92,16,EPA's only issue is people who aren't able to afford the masks they want. They're not going to be able to afford the EPA's 'defensive' tool.
16,1,The EPA is working on a CDC initiative to prevent the spread of viruses. They are also trying to make people who aren't infected with viruses have a helmet that is supposed to cover up their actions.
16,15,"""... because I've got my own phd."""
18,16,It’s a cliche. The best way to do this is to make yourself feel safe.
29,16,They're saying that this is one of the best ways to keep people away from spreading the virus.
31,16,I don't see anything wrong with this.
41,16,"i want to read more about this, which is a nice way to say it, but do you want to think about the ""consumers of a vaccine"" movement and how it relates to the death of a family member who was the primary target?"
52,16,"The guy who is wearing the mask said that the government's job is to protect the man, not prevent the spread of the virus. The President of the United States doesn't wear a mask for the flu, but for the mask, he is wearing a mask to prevent the spread of the virus. The guy who is wearing the mask is saying that the government should use masks for prevention and to prevent the spread of virus."
55,16,"It's one of those things that it doesn't make sense, and that I hate."
60,16,The joke doesn't stop the spread of the disease. It stops the spread. I'm pretty sure this has anything to do with the virus.
61,16,"They are using the same tactic and methods to get people's vaccines, instead of getting them off to do the same tactic and doing whatever else they want with the health care reforms."
72,16,"""The guy in the video is referring to an old guy who is still going to die without the help of a mask. I think this was part of what 'Suck it Up' was about. I read it as ""I love you."" I thought it was sarcastic and not a joke."
78,16,>I think that the one-handed government policy that is implementing in the US is to allow people to have a helmet in public. I don't know what to do with this but you're being really sarcastic - there's a lot of information in here that points to that. if he had the courage to put a mask on the neck he'd be able to save his life. that would be great.
84,16,"A bit more like a ""I think that a lot of the skepticism that comes with the federal government's approach to protecting health care should be put to rest. I think that a lot of the skepticism that comes with the federal government's approach to protecting health care should be put to rest."
85,16,He wore a mask and told the CIA about it.
92,16,I don't know why you're being so snarky.
16,1,">This guy in the video is referring to an old guy who is still going to die without the help of a mask. I think this was part of what 'Suck It Up' was about. I read it as ""I love you."" I don't see anything wrong with this."
16,15,The most terrifying dreadful part of the video is how he tried to steal a hat from his brother. It's not his job to protect someone who isn't infected with a virus. He's trying to help people with a very expensive virus.
18,16,It seems like a very common joke.
29,16,"I would be shocked to learn that this is an innocuous and racist phrase that was only used in the US and never translated. It's like saying 'There's nothing wrong with the government, it's just that people don't use it'. It's like saying, 'There's nothing wrong with the government.'"
31,16,"I'm going to give you the most accurate explanation. Despite all the crazy stuff about masks and my opinion on them, I'm pretty sure most people with serious illnesses feel the same way, and that's not the only reason. I think it's a joke and it does seem like it's getting away with being so sexist. The idea of the mask making people feel stupid about it is kind of pathetic."
41,16,"If he had a life outside the system, he could have been protected by the EPA."
52,16,"I don't like the idea of a man wearing a mask for the flu. I think there is a real reason for people to wear a mask. I'm not a big fan of that stuff, but I do want to thank the NSA for not taking away the responsibility for this. So, they're going to stop the spread of a virus. So, they're going to stop the spread of a virus? This is a joke, and I don't mean to be a sarcasm, but you are absolutely right in that"
55,16,The truth is the truth. He's not sexist. It's a joke.
60,16,"So, if the guy didn't wear a mask, how many people would not wear a mask to protest?"
61,16,"I think you're being very confused here, I am not saying they don't have a problem with this issue. I am saying that this is a big deal with a big deal with an entire nation. It's a major problem with the government."
72,16,CANNOTANSWER OP?
78,16,"The ACA is actually aimed at helping to prevent more people from getting sick from wear a mask. But it's a fucked up policy that doesn't work on other countries, such as Africa."
84,16,"Well, that's pretty accurate. And, I'd like to go with that."

16,1,"he is being sarcastic and saying ""but i don't want to lose any health care and get sick"" and then he has a face mask?"
16,15,It's a joke.
18,16,"I'm a huge fan of this, and I agree."
29,16,I cant even explain that if I'm a guy wearing a mask. It's a joke that can only be put down because it seems like a joke.
31,16,">I'm not surprised that a lot of people use it to justify their actions, but I'd like to clarify how I feel."
41,16,"if you want to read more about this, you need to read the sidebar."
52,16,"I think you're right. They should do something for the government. I think there are many examples that support that, but I don't really think it's what they're supposed to be doing. I think that's the first thing they should have done."
55,16,"So, what would be the point of this discussion? How is this not the way the president does this? It seems like he is trying to influence people to do something to stop a virus."
60,16,"I can think of many more that you are not going to get the reference to, for that matter. You just say that a mask makes you look weird, a person isn't ok with the 'i'm going to wear a mask' joke."
61,16,They are doing everything they want. They are attempting to put people in danger by cutting off access to vaccines.
72,16,You have no idea what a skunk would think. Having a mask isn't a joke. The mask in question is not in order to prevent HIV/AIDS and I think it's a joke.
78,16,">We all eve a mask at least once a year in our country, and a big part of it is the protection we give our children. I'm pretty sure the idea of a vaccination in the US is not really a joke because there isn't much they can do in that regard."
84,16,"''Oh man, I've got a joke '' to make."
85,16,"I don't understand what you mean by ""sarcasm""."
92,16,EPA wants to get involved in cutting a very complex problem that is not the federal government and that is why they are making more money than they are working towards.
16,1,(i do not think it's the way the president does this) It seems like he is trying to influence people to do something for the government.
16,15,... and you mean the government? It's making money in a way. It sounds like it's a joke.
18,16,"My boyfriend and I, wearing masks for fun. They're the only ones who've really really made me hate wearing them. I'm a big fan of their stuff, and I can't stand people's views on it."
29,16,I agree with the other commenters - it sounds like a good thing that there are people like this.
31,16,I'm not sure if you're a huge fan or not but that is what I've heard from a lot of people on Reddit.
41,16,"Do you want to read more about this, which is a nice way to say it, but do you want to think about the ""consumers of a vaccine"" movement and how it relates to the death of a family member who was the primary target?"
52,16,"You know what a skunk is? They're the ones who should have been able to say what a skunk is and why they shouldn't be able to say whatever they want on the internet and you're the one that should be able to say anything and anything you want to say. The CDC should be able to tell people what to do with this skunk joke, and there's a lot of evidence that it's the real solution. The author is so stupid as the story doesn't work."
55,16,Vaccination is essential to stopping the spread of a virus.
60,16,A lot of this is just a common joke. But they're probably not going to censor it and they're going to be just as stupid.
61,16,"I'm not going to say that this is a petty joke, but I'll tell you what I read. I'm not going to lie to you, because it is not a joke."
72,16,"People wear masks to protect themselves from being effected. I'd tell a friend ''RIP you scumbag. You've just been dragged to a show."" ''You've just been dragged to a show."" ''Suck it Up'''"
78,16,"In all honesty I am not a fan of ACA, but I agree with this."
84,16,"I am a republican and I know a lot of people who think wearing a mask is a good idea if you don't like it when people don't think it's a good idea - but when it comes to health care and how people are treated, the truth is that I would be able to go with the one-liners."
85,16,>[The US government is essentially trying to stop the spread of a virus.Do they have a government mandate to take off a mask to prevent infectivity?
92,16,"If you believe in the idea of being a troll, then you're too harsh. That's a lie, right?"

I don't see anything wrong with this.'', ""But I don't want to lose any health care and get sick"" and then he has a helmet that is supposed to cover up their actions."""""
16,15,"As a Canadian, I think the best way to understand this is by getting to know the US. It's not as easy as saying we wear a mask to prevent the spread of a virus, but it's not really the same thing as saying the CDC should be able to tell people what to do with it."
18,16,They are not supposed to stop the spread of a virus.
29,16,It's a joke. And to use a mask outside on a job that is very tight but has a lot of health benefits.
31,16,...the only reason the government actually does something is because people are getting mad at you.
41,16,[NAME] is going to be a bad person.
52,16,"The story isn't a joke, it's an article."
55,16,He's doing the right thing by not wearing a mask. It's useless and I hate it.
60,16,Because the joke doesn't stop the spread of the disease.
61,16,My coworkers were always very upset because the CDC was being extremely overly protective and I figured that if you had a mask there would be a huge problem.
72,16,I think it's the wrong joke.
78,16,"I mean, this is not the kind of thing that's really fun or exciting, the kind of thing that is fun, or at least what's on a TV."
84,16,"So, you are saying that the government should enact legislation to help prevent the spread of a virus?"
85,16,I think you have an answer for this.
92,16,"I’m not saying that I’d be fired but that’s a bit unfair. I have read it as a “I don’t think you should be fired” and it’s a “I don’t think you should be fired for not wearing a mask” despite my own opinion, and I can’t think of any other way to put it."
16,1,"There is a whole article where the doctor asks him to wear a mask because he doesn't want to lose health care or get sick, but it's the man who says he has a mask, so he can have a facial mask that reflects his life to the doctor."
16,15,"That was so much more offensive than my 'I'd be a good person', I had a feeling I'd end up putting on my mask."
18,16,"I am in a situation similar to this, so I feel it makes sense to keep this subreddit up."
29,16,"It's pretty easy to hear what the CDC was referencing, but I don't know what the US government is trying to do. There is a lot of information out there on the CDC."
31,16,I have a terrible idea why people need to take a joke. I'm going to make a ridiculous joke because it's funny. But I'll say it's a joke.
41,16,"You don't need a federal mandate to keep the federal government in business, do you?"
52,16,I'm going to ask you if you have any other questions that you might be curious about.
55,16,"I don't know what to say about ""the whole thing."" I can be more clear here: I just want you to know that if you don't wear a mask then don't work. That is the whole point of a mask. The mask is to protect you from the spread of a virus."
60,16,"People believe that the government is not using sexist humor to stop the spread of the virus. They believe it's a joke, but they believe it to be true."
61,16,"This is not just a joke, it's a statement made about how the government is going to be in charge of health."
72,16,"I don't have any idea how the skunk guy would say something like that. That's not the kind of thing that people like to have, it's a sexist joke."
78,16,"The mask was made in an attempt to prevent the spread of the virus. It sounds like the government wants to stop it and that the first thing they do is make it mandatory for people to have a mask on. That doesn't mean it's a joke, it means that there's not enough evidence to make it legal for people to get a vaccine."
84,16,That's a sarcastic question and I think that a lot of the skepticism that comes with the federal government's approach to protecting health care should be put to rest. I think that a lot of the skepticism that comes with the federal government's approach to protecting health care should be put to rest.
85,16,"I think you have no idea what you're referencing. You are suggesting that it's inappropriate for a person to be wearing a mask. You say, ""I have read that people like wearing a mask in public places when they want to wear them."""
92,16,"I have always been anti government and hate to say anything negative about this. This is the kind of thing I can't stand, and that's why I've found my job, but the people I work for are too stupid to care about the EPA."
16,1,The reason for wearing a mask is because people don't want to lose health care and get sick.
16,15,This is why people on here keep trying to figure out how to communicate with one another.
18,16,"""...I don't think wearing a mask outside or in your car alone is good for your mental health. I think wearing a mask outside or in your car alone is better than going outside alone."""
29,16,There is a lot of information out there on the CDC.
31,16,"This is why people want to be a doctor - and we should be doing everything in our power to help prevent the spread of the flu. The CDC wants to have a good reason not getting sick, but isn't."
41,16,It is an obvious example of the government's retaliation against anti-Vaxxers.
52,16,A lot of people are confused about the actual joke.
55,16,They have to wear the mask in the future to stop the spread of a virus.
60,16,Vaccines aren't even legal anymore. They're not going to help with the spread of the virus.
61,16,The article I read about it and r/RightsAndReddit is in a completely different subreddit than this post and the entire post is about a lot of things. I don't know why anyone would be upset about the CDC being overly protective.
72,16,This guy is a skunk.
78,16,The ACA is just an attempt to stop the spread of a virus.
84,16,I don't get that any of these are the most popular comments.
85,16,"This post sounds like a very interesting one. I'm glad to hear that people are now going to take on this shit, but there is some pretty stupid rhetoric out there about the idea of wearing a mask if you want to protect the public. You can see the potential to be infected by wearing a mask on the street and the fact that it is a great idea."
92,16,"It is a fucked up one. Honestly, he's a dick."
16,1,This is a huge red flag and I'm going to go back to reading this post. This is how people can have a lot of fun.
16,15,The reason it's inappropriate for a person to be wearing a mask is because people don't want to lose health care and get sick.
18,16,This is pretty stupid. But a lot of people are using it as an excuse to get their vaccines.

31,16,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

55,16,"...and that's the joke that just got written. It was a joke. And now that I understand the meaning of this I'm gonna go ahead and say 'Women's Mask', but I want you to be clear in what you say about the mask and the other comments about ""Still here's the one I can't comprehend."""
60,16,What's not to like about a mask?
61,16,The NRA is being sabotaged by the government. They aren't a government agency.
72,16,"You said something to me, and you didn't answer that."
78,16,If I'm not mistaken. This is the first time a joke is made like this in the internet: I do not want to know what's going on with my life.
84,16,People will wear them to protest the lack of adequate medical care. Whether it be a cancer or a blood disease?
85,16,"You're right, a mask is really an uncomfortable idea. But, this is the problem. That supposition is so ridiculous. It's a big thing and the government is trying to prevent it."
92,16,"OP's statement is based on the notion that people can’t work without a mask, and thus can’t have jobs."
16,1,"I'd start with ""I'm not anti-Vaxx."" and then change to ""The fact that this is not a joke because there isn't much the president can do in that regard."""
16,15,CANNOTANSWER: Is this going to get upvoted? I'm not anti-Vaxx. What's the point of the article? he's not being a prick for not bringing up the right and wrong reasons. he is a doppelganger of the [Propaganda Section](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_by_sharp_and_advice_of_the_virus)
18,16,Vaccination is not going to stop people from getting sick without a vaccine.
29,16,The CDC is trying to prevent and eliminate some of these things.
31,16,This isn't a joke. This is a joke.
41,16,"I know the topic of the post is not that much more controversial, but the article is very clingy. The article is not well worded. It is not just a federal topic.'Is the article actually written by the NRA?"
52,16,"I hate to say it, but there is a lot of evidence that he was a racist."
55,16,It doesn't seem like they're using the word 'terrorist' in their statement. The quote is about a woman who is infected with HIV/AIDS. It's a joke about the fact that he is going to wear a mask to protect herself from HIV/AIDS.
60,16,A lot of this is just a common joke. But they believe it to be true. They believe it to be true. They believe it to be true.
61,16,I have a lot of misconceptions about 'putting people in danger'. I'm not a doctor. But I'm not a physician.
72,16,"OP, ""You said something to me, and you didn't answer that."""
78,16,It sounds like the government is simply doing the right thing. Is there a way we can stop that from happening? It sounds like that would be a joke. If this is a joke it isn't.
84,16,"It's a bit bizarre, but that's the type of shit we're talking about."
85,16,I'm sorry you can't get into the story.
92,16,I'm just reading your OP a bit. It seems like I've read more of the article than I should have.
16,1,The Obama administration is doing something right. I'm fucking shit at this and the fact that the people are insecure and ashamed of their own health is a big red flag.
16,15,Vaccination is not going to stop people from getting sick without a vaccine. The CDC is trying to prevent and eliminate some of these things.
18,16,Wearing a mask to hide a viral infection is a terrible way to keep the health of an individual.
29,16,It’s an awfully funny joke. I hope you don’t think it’s racist.
31,16,I think the only thing I can think of for the day is the notion that sexist is so prevalent in the US that it's hard to really see why they have a problem.
41,16,I think you're right. The AMA is a huge piece about what the NSA is doing. And what you're trying to say is that this is not a logical and rational thing to do.
52,16,"This is one of those situations where people are completely devoid of a proper understanding of the facts and facts, but I would say that in the long run, this is one of those situations where it's a joke."
55,16,>It doesn't seem like they're using the word 'terrorist' in their statement.
60,16,"I'd be very annoyed at the fact that you're just saying that if it were just a joke, the joke isn't funny."
61,16,"I have always felt like this is a great post. I would be a bit more surprised if this would make a comment about someone in the country that didn't have a mask but is a nyc representative, and was in the US for a while and haven't been to a 'funny' post. That was pretty unrelated to the whole conversation."
72,16,I think the article is more detailed and clearly stating that the AMA is about the AIDS/HIV virus epidemic.
78,16,"There's a joke in the movie ""I'm not a fan of the ACA, but I agree with this"". ""() It is a joke. It is a joke. If this is a joke. In general, if the problem isn't the mask. Its not the idea of a vaccine. Its a joke. In a good way, I think the idea of making people who have a virus be better off without it is just what the ACA is about. I'm not a joke. ""."
84,16,"The joke is, because we are a racist organization."
85,16,I am a lawyer. I am a lawyer and I will be a lawyer. This isn't a joke.
92,16,"You're on reddit, don't bother."
16,1,"It’s a funny, funny comment."
16,15,">To be fair, the AMA was supposed to be about people who didn't have a mask to prevent them getting sick, so in general it seems like a joke, isn't it?"
18,16,"I've been in a lot of situations where I wore a mask for fun but was being forced to wear a mask to help myself. I know some people don't, but I find it to be a way to go."
29,16,I don’t think it is racist. That’s how people respond to the CDC referring to people who don’t wear masks in public. The CDC isn’t trying to reduce vaccination and they can’t cut it out to prevent it.
31,16,Vaccination is an essential part of any policy. I’d rather have a private one or a private one that is based on what I’m told.
41,16,''The AMA is a huge piece about what the NSA is doing. And what you're trying to say is that this is not a logical and rational thing to do. I think the article is really well worded.
52,16,"In the article, the president mentioned a few jokes about the virus. The CDC's spokesperson has said that the disease is not ""too serious"" but it is very difficult for the public to understand why he is wearing a mask."
55,16,Is this part of a joke about being an anti-government group?
60,16,"There's nothing funny about a joke, or an issue. Just to let you know that they are using a joke to stop the spread of the virus."
61,16,> (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CannotAmend-a-Mallet-Block). No I'm sorry to say that this is what happened. You're not in it for nothing. I don't think the NRA is a terrorist group.
72,16,"I read the AMA as 'I love you' and ""I like you"""
78,16,There's a movie where a guy is joking about the ACA a bit ad absurdum claiming the ACA is the only ACA that works?
84,16,It's a joke.
85,16,"You are not a joke, are you?"
92,16,A ain't nobody reading this.
16,1,"I didn't realize that the ACA is the only vaccine that doesn't really do anything but prevent the spread of viruses. I read the AMA as I wasn't anti-Vaxx, just that it is, as if this isn't a joke. I read the AMA as ""I'm not a fan of the ACA, but I agree with this""."
16,15,i've read some of the comments.
18,16,"I don't know if it's really that funny if you haven't already, but I'm afraid that you're being completely obtuse about a word or two."
29,16,"The article states: ""The government has no problem with some people saying they are against government mandates, but this doesn't necessarily mean that they are against government mandates."""
31,16,"What if I were this guy and it was a doctor, I'd get sick and that's the whole point of being a doctor? I'd be a doctor if I ever wanted to get sick."
41,16,It's not a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. The EPA is a government-sponsored organization that needs to know what's going on and what's going on. They’re getting a bit out of control. It’s the ACA’s policy and they’re getting passed.
52,16,I think a good way to start this discussion is to make sure that the article is accurate.
55,16,They fucking can't make a joke about being anti-government
60,16,It's a joke. A lot of the jokes they make tend to be funny.
61,16,"I am confused as to why it is not a prank. I am not going to lie to you, because it is not a joke."
72,16,"It was a joke, not a joke at all, and a joke is a sexist joke."
78,16,The US has to work very hard to get the ACA repealed.
84,16,Wearing a mask in the us to stop the spread of a virus.
85,16,"""There's an amazing and important thing that we can all do to make this a thing that we should make up."
92,16,"Having a job at the EPA (and the people you work for) is probably not the best way to deal with the issues you are facing. It's a joke, a lie, and a dick move to distract from it. If this was the case in the past, I wouldn't have a job for EPA."
16,1,"Well, what if I were your guy and it was a virus, I would stop doing this and get a job at the EPA."
16,15,The whole issue of not wanting to have a hat from a virologist is not a joke. It's just a joke.
18,16,And it's a pretty good thing the federal government is not the one to make up for the fact that it's promoting a vaccine.
29,16,"The article says: ""I'd rather adapt wear the mask and survive than contract the virus bc of what s more comfortable"""
31,16,"It's very funny, but I don't think anyone could be wrong about the idea that it's not a joke, or that it's not an attempt to discredit it."
41,16,"OP, I'd like to clarify that while the AMA is interesting it's the actual AMA and AMA are the same, in my opinion."
52,16,"The whole thing seems very, very ridiculous. You can do things that are not good for you but are not that way. They should definitely be taking action for the betterment of health."
55,16,"So why do doctors wear masks at all? If you like a mask, you need to wear a mask and it's safe."
60,16,Vaccines aren't legal anymore. They're not going to help combat the spread of the virus.
61,16,I'm very confused. What's the point of this conversation?
72,16,"Basically, the idea of a skunk is ""suck it up"". You are saying ""suck it up"". That's pretty sexist and a joke."
78,16,What the fuck? This is what it is.
84,16,"... and the truth is that the government is just doing their job.... It is a joke, but you can't make a joke that the government can't provide enough health care. The president doesn't even have to wear a mask. The government is trying to keep the healthcare system healthy. If the president was a skeptic about the government, he should be a skeptic, as is my theory."
85,16,"It's about whether people will continue to be ill and unprepared, not that crazy, but how many nihilists have you encountered?"
92,16,"I’m sure there are others that are already doing this as well, but I think we have to ask the President to address the situation, not the ""people with a mask"" part. It's a joke. The problem is that they aren’t going to do anything."
16,1,"Yes, I think he was being a little crazy about this."
16,15,"""It is an essential precaution to get your health at the highest possible levels, and it is a good way to ensure you have plenty of safety."
18,16,"If you are a public servant, I'd recommend that you go and buy a mask if you have one. That's the only reason to have someone take care of you. And that is why I can't imagine spending that kind of money on some one who's not going to take care of you if you're not being a cop, unless you want to see a cop, which is not an option."
29,16,"They're referring to the government, I don't think that makes any sense."
31,16,The first thing I heard in the last three days was that the CDC was using masks to protect people from infection. Then a doctor came to the room and told the CDC to wear a mask.
41,16,It's really not an interesting article.
52,16,"A lot of things have happened in the last 40 years but none of them have been reported. This is not about health care. This is about the health care system, not the health insurance."
55,16,...and that's the whole thing.
60,16,Vaccines are not legal anymore. They're not going to help combat the spread of the virus.
61,16,Isn't there a reason the CDC was sabotaged by the federal government?
72,16,"The thing about a skunk AMA is that it's not a joke. It's an attack on the idea of the government who wants to get rid of a virus. They can say no, but this is actually the AMA."
78,16,I'm not joking. I am just asking for your input.
84,16,I have heard it described a bit of a joke. Like a good joke.
85,16,It's a big joke that the CDC wants to eliminate vaccines for people with the same condition that haven't been vaccinated. They're going to use them for a variety of reasons.
92,16,>I think wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
16,1,"The president can't make the joke of it. Unless he does. The president's government's policies are gonna get worse, and he will use them in an increasingly desperate effort to stop it."
16,15,"I was just reading about it. There's an AMA about a viral infection being sprayed onto people in different parts of the country for a variety of reasons, but I have to wonder if this actually applies to people in the US."
18,16,I don't understand why you don't want to eat. You eat.
29,16,> Is he supposed to be a man of wit?
31,16,"I'm really glad they've got the info. It's not about the joke, it's about how people can be stupid. It's not about the fact that people use a joke to justify their actions, but rather the fact that they're wrong. 'The only way we can stop the spread of a virus is to put a shield on all the people that want to try to prevent it. ''A lot of this sounds more like a joke than a joke."
41,16,The NRA is not even a news organization.
52,16,"And the CDC should know, too."
55,16,"""Hey, I can't believe in the truth."""
60,16,I'd tell you that I am more of a liberal than a dick about the joke.
61,16,"Its not a joke, it's a statement."
72,16,"It's a joke. It's a joke, it's an attack on the idea that the government is trying to get rid of a virus. The government isn't insensitive and this is what's called an AMA. I think a joke is only a joke when it is intended as an attack on the idea of the government who wants to stop the spread of a virus. They can say no, but this is actually the AMA."
78,16,I am a member of the American Affairs Organization of Religions. It is a great show.
84,16,"The first sentence of the article says ""... if the president was a skeptic about the government, he should be a skeptic."" It sounds like the government has not done the job it is supposed to do, so there isn't much you can do."
85,16,It sounds like the joke is going to have a lot more ramifications than it should.
92,16,"It sounds like OP's point would be that if the government had implemented these measures, they'd be more willing to take measures against it."
16,1,I am really glad I am a member of the American Affairs Organization of Religions.
16,15,"I don't really understand what is going on here. There are a lot of people who do not like the idea of having to wear a mask for vaccination, but do a good job of showing up at meetings and talking to a public health officer, and I have to say that is one of the best places for them to post their comments. This is going to get upvoted if you read the whole article."
18,16,A lot of people get sick while wearing masks. And because of this it's a joke that nobody else is supposed to use. This is probably because you are being dragged to a subreddit about this.
29,16,CANNOTANSWER: I'm just pointing out that the government hasn't done anything to stop the spread of a virus. I'm not sure what your point is.
31,16,I'm going to give you the most accurate explanation.
41,16,CANNOTANSWER: I’m a pretty liberal conservative. I think that what the article is about is the biggest threat he’s had to take on the EPA.
52,16,It would be pretty easy to take away the role of the CDC in this because it’s a little skewed. You need to put it in the mouth of an ex.
55,16,It sounds like the only way for Obama to have a fight for the ACA is to change the medical system.
60,16,"I don't like the word ""joke"" when it comes to the subject."
61,16,"""The ACA"" is the best plan in the history of healthcare for the next 50 years. It's not a joke and doesn't exist for everyone. It is a good plan."
72,16,"It's a joke, and it's a nutjob joke, because a skunk is a skunk and the joke is a nutjob joke. It's a skunk, and a joke."
78,16,">I'm pretty sure the idea of a vaccination in the US isn't really a joke because there isn't much they can do in that regard."""
84,16,The first paragraph isn't so much that it doesn't really mean anything in general or even that it actually means anything.
85,16,I don't understand why they think people should eat a hive mind for fear of being ripped off or not being vaccinated.
92,16,"You are being smug, right??"
16,1,a lot of people get sick while wearing a mask. I don't think they have a right to wear a mask. They have the right to wear a mask to keep them in check.
16,15,">It sounds like your brother and I both have very different views of the subject.', 'Yes it is. The mask is a good thing. They can protect themselves against the sexism. It is also good for people to prevent it.',"
18,16,"...and if they can't afford to get rid of the EPA, they're going to have to take them out. The article states that the CDC has an issue and has been trying to derail the healthcare system. They can fire people who don't comply with the regulations and would be fired for violating them. A lot of people get sick while wearing a mask. 'It is pretty stupid. But a lot of people get sick while wearing a mask. A lot of people get sick while wearing hat."
29,16,I wouldn’t wear a mask at the NSA or a reputable source.
31,16,"No, the article is not racist."
41,16,"The AMA is very, very controversial and very true."
52,16,>The CDC is trying to force people to wear a mask in order to stop the spread of a virus.
55,16,"I'd like to say that the fact that wearing a mask would be a joke isn't the whole point of this discussion. The president is a joke about the government, he's trying to make fun of it. RIP, the people who have their nose cut off, the people who have their mouth cut off, the people who have their nose cut off, the people who have their nose cut off, the people who have their nose cut off, the people who have their nose cut off, and the people who have their nose cut off."
60,16,"No, he didn't say the joke was funny. It's funny that they've taken a back seat to the situation. Vaccines aren't legally allowed anymore. Vaccination isn't even legal anymore. They're not going to help combat the spread of the virus. The only problem is the article that says that it's not a joke, but a joke."
61,16,It is not a joke. It is a problem. And it is not a joke.
72,16,The article is misleading and the headlines are misleading.
78,16,...but I can't get past the fact that you're not a fan of the one-handed government policy.'
84,16,"I think we need to make a public policy of health care, not the other way around."
85,16,">I think there is a huge misconception here about who's getting the ACA and when it comes to a healthy lifestyle, and to be honest, if you haven't seen that movie, then the joke is pretty much lost on you. I'm sure the CDC has found a very good source to make that up."
92,16,> EPA doesn't have the authority to stop the spread of a virus.
16,1,[I'm pretty sure] wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
16,15,"Nope, I don't."
18,16,This is a joke. The government has no power to do anything. They are just a joke.
29,16,CANNOTANSWER: I'm just pointing out that the government hasn't done anything to stop the spread of a virus.
31,16,"Aside from the fact that the CDC is able to protect people from getting the virus (sorry, I'm sorry), the people on the internet are just trying to get people to accept that you are wrong and not being racist."
41,16,Is the AMA actually written by the NRA?
52,16,CANNOTANSWER: It's just a joke.
55,16,People wear masks because they get sick.
60,16,"The article is misleading. I'm pretty sure it's an actual joke, which I'm not sure people are saying is true, but the fact that it's not a joke in this context is completely irrelevant."
61,16,"The problem isn't that the government isn't responsible for everything, it's that they are trying to sabotage the healthcare system."
72,16,I've read that the article was misleading and the headlines were misleading. It hasn't been analyzed in detail. It's an AMA. It's misleading and misleading. The article is misleading and misleading. The article is not a joke.
78,16,"CANNOTANSWER is not a fan of the ACA, but I agree with the joke."
84,16,"... that's really scary fucking question, and that's not the right answer. I think that a lot of the skepticism that comes with the federal government's approach to protecting health care should be put to rest."
85,16,"He was charged with a crime of wearing a mask, not a crime of being in a hat, not of being in a mask, but of being a sarcastically ignorant asshole."
92,16,"They don't have the authority to stop the spread of a virus, but they should be able to do so without a mask. The issue isn't the state, and they shouldn't be firing people for having a mask or getting a jab."
16,1,"The problem isn't that the government isn't responsible for everything, it's that they are trying to sabotage the healthcare system."
16,15,">I think the issue isn't the state, and they shouldn't be firing people for having a mask or getting a jab."
18,16,"It's actually more than one thing, and it has very very similar repercussions. It's one of the first times a government agency is able to do something illegal, because it's a bit of a joke. But it's not the whole situation. It's just a joke that it's been doing."
29,16,he’s an attack on the CIA
31,16,"I think it is hilarious that someone uses the word ""joke"" so much and this article isn't a joke, it's more of a sexist joke."
41,16,"There are a lot of different views, one being to make them more partisan. But I'm still not a big fan."
52,16,">It's one of those situations where people are completely devoid of a proper understanding of the facts and facts, but I would say that in the long run, this is one of those situations where it's a joke."
55,16,I'm not sure if he is a sexist or a sexist joke.
60,16,The joke doesn't stop the spread of the virus.
61,16,"There are people who get the most of the ""so that the government isn't responsible for everything"" jokes: ""You can't wear a mask in the US."""
72,16,"It's a joke a lot of people believe in, but I don't know how that came across. This is not a joke."
78,16,It's not a joke. I don't think it is the joke of the ACA that is being slammed.
84,16,I think the president should just let his jokes go.
85,16,i agree with all of the other comments in the thread.
92,16,"I think this is a fair one. I can't think of an acceptable troll in this context, and the actual jokes I think about are satirical. But, if you really want to understand the issue, I think you might want to give me an example of the EPA that will be more than happy to be a part of the solution."
16,1,I don't really understand why you're being downvoted. I think it's time to stop joking. I think the idea is that everyone is a bit petty about the fact that their state is involved. I think it's time to stop joking about being in an office that has no responsibility to protect them from the government.
16,15,"The ""Joke"" about the CDC is basically ""Don't tell me what to do with my mask. Do I have to wear it?"""
18,16,I'm sorry but I'm not at all in favor of the people trying to use the word 'judgement' as a joke. It's just that they can do it without the federal government.
29,16,There's a story in my book about a guy who had to wear a mask after being infected.
31,16,I've read about this at least 4 times before.
41,16,>I’m a pretty liberal conservative. I think that what the article is about is the biggest threat he’s had to take on the EPA.
52,16,You think this is a joke?
55,16,It's a joke that's used to justify the CDC. And it's a joke that the government has already put into place.
60,16,I'm gonna get all of that out of my head.
61,16,I don't think a government is going to change anything. You can't make any other government change.
72,16,"""Well I'm just wondering if it has nothing to do with what's going on in this country, and this is not a joke. I don't know how this came across."""
78,16,"Assuming that you are a fan of the ACA, I don't think this joke is the joke. The joke is an attempt to prevent the spread of a virus. It sounds like the government wants to stop it and that the first thing they do is make it mandatory for people to have a helmet in public."
84,16,"The first line is 'I don't get that any of these are the most popular comments."""
85,16,"oh wow you are not kidding, the president made a joke out of that joke. He is being sarcastic, but not being the'sarcastic one'. That's the kind of thing you would expect from the hive mind. I'm sure there are some pretty good sources to make up the joke."
92,16,I'm not a federal contractor - I am an independent contractor and we use to work for the federal government. So I don't know why you're being so smug.
16,1,"""Also, the fact that I'm not in favor of the ACA is a joke because there isn't much the government can do in that regard."""
16,15,"They're trying to fucking change the government by dumping people in a public place, and they're just trying to make fun of it."
18,16,">I've been in a lot of situations where I wore a mask outside or in your car alone is good for your mental health. I think wearing a mask outside or in your car alone is better than going outside alone."","
29,16,CANNOTANSWER: I find it so interesting how his attempt at protecting the public is so strong and so eloquent. Is he supposed to be a man of wit?
31,16,"CANNOTANSWER: I think it's a joke. The only reason it's a joke is because people are getting mad at me. I'm pretty sure most people with serious illnesses feel the same way, and that's not the only reason."
41,16,You think he was a joke? It's a joke and the government should pay for it.
52,16,"I was able to make a joke from the cover, but then it was kind of too long."
55,16,"""Something I didn't know about the health care bill was a joke. It seems like he is trying to influence people to do something to stop a virus."""
60,16,A good one. You have to get over the fact that a lot of the jokes that the NRA is making seem so funny. Its a joke.
61,16,Why is a public health agency involved in this?
72,16,You are making a good point. You need to write it down. I will post a summary later.
78,16,i want to know what kind of joke i'm talking about.
84,16,This is an awesome joke that the CDC has put in place for the protection of health care.
85,16,"This is so funny because it's funny that the government is trying to stop the spread of the virus, but not just a joke."
92,16,I have a lot of ideas for you.
16,1,There is a whole article where the doctor asks him to wear a mask because he doesn't want to lose health care and get sick.
16,15,"I can't see the whole joke, but I still think the idea of the ACA is a joke. I think that if people are asking for a mask in public, they don't want to hear it. If you aren't getting a mask, you don't want to hear it."
18,16,">Then he says he is a racist because he believes that people who want to be racist should know what he's talking about, and that the president can't afford to spend money to protect others."
29,16,"""We're referring to people who don't wear a mask in public, so we can stop spreading the virus."""
31,16,CANNOTANSWER: '...the only reason the government actually does something is because people are getting mad at me.
41,16,It's a prank.
52,16,There's a lot of good examples of the skunk joke in this.
55,16,"I think it's a troll, but you gotta get your hopes up. It's just so awfully untrue. You can't say a joke doesn't really work in the real world, I'm not gonna listen to your skunk joke about the government."
60,16,You’re all in the minority.
61,16,I think you've just misread what you wrote. The article is supposed to be about the government.
72,16,"I would say that I'm a fan of the NRA, but I don't believe they are right to sue me for what they've said."
78,16,I can't tell what a joke is.
84,16,"I don't know what it means to be a senator, but there is a lot more than a joke : it sounds like people are in the middle of trying to have their own opinion about the health care situation. The person is not the one to tell the joke. They are the one to make the joke. The person that is a skeptic about the government does not need to be able to have a presidential office."
85,16,"''We want to stop the spread of a virus ''' 'I'm not going to say it isn't a joke'''. ''I'm going to make a joke about that ''I don't get it'''', 'I don't understand why the government is trying to prevent the spread of a virus '''' and ''I'm not going to make it to work'''' ''Is this what the president's ''' joke''"
92,16,"I like that the term ""fake"" is used as an excuse to work for the EPA."

18,16,"Vaccination is a joke. Then he says he is a racist because he believes that people who want to be racist should know what he's talking about, and that the president can't afford to spend money to protect others."
29,16,The issue is being discussed because you don't know anything about it.
31,16,Why do you even have a choice? The CDC doesn't really care about preventing people from getting vaccinated.
41,16,"AMA: [NRA member,] I think the article is really well worded. It is not well worded. It is not just a federal topic."
52,16,"CANNOTANSWER... is one of those situations where people are completely devoid of a proper understanding of the facts and facts, but I would say that in the long run, this is one of those situations where it's a joke. The article's name is ""a ripoff of a huuuge wikipedia article."""
55,16,Vaccination is essential to stopping the spread of a virus.

78,16,"i think they need to repeal it asap, which I doubt i would do."
84,16,What kind of person is it a skeptic about?
85,16,"I've heard this many times in this thread. The person who said ""I have read that people like wearing a mask in public places when they want to wear them."""
92,16,"The article states ""I think wearing a mask is what is important to me. I think you could try to justify your actions in this way, which is what the rest of the article is about."
16,1,I'm on a rant about that one and it's on there.
16,15,I've heard it mentioned a few times.
18,16,... and I feel like I'm being completely obtuse about a word or two.
29,16,It is the US government who is using the CDC to prevent the spread of the virus.
31,16,I’m a doctor. I’d get sick and die of a flu.
41,16,"The NRA is a national advocacy group, so they should stop promoting the anti-Vaxx group."
52,16,I am so confused that I'm reading what the article is saying and wonder why people aren't even aware of what's going on with that joke.
55,16,"I can't help you. I can't even say the name of the article, even though it is a joke."
60,16,AMA: The only person who can get vaccinated is a person who was sick for 5 years before the vaccine was a thing.
61,16,The AMA is based on the actual fact that the CDC isn't sabotage. It's also about how the CDC is using the government to sabotage the healthcare system.
72,16,> People are referring to the issue of the issue of the mask being a joke in general.
78,16,"The government is not doing the right thing because it is trying to repeal the ACA, but they are trying to be the one that does."
84,16,I think the most effective way to do this is to simply take the people from a poll and put them on a bus for about a week and then start throwing in some sarcastic jokes.
85,16,People aren't supposed to eat a hat for a health purpose. They wear a mask. They're supposed to be hatless.
92,16,"You don't have to be the one to be fired for wearing a mask, but the one to be able to say ""I don't think you should be fired"" is what a troll would say, or at least make you believe it. Until then, the article is all for what OP thinks."
16,1,"It's like ""What if I were your guy and it was a virus, I would stop doing this and get a job at the EPA."""
16,15,"There is actually a lot of talk on there. There are a lot of people who don't like the idea of having to wear a mask in public and if it's not the right thing to do, you can sue them. The point of being a doppelganger is that the government is trying to prevent the spread of the virus."
18,16,This sub is about all the federal laws being implemented if you want to save your lives. It's a joke.
29,16,">“I think it's pretty easy to hear what the CDC was referencing, but I don't know what your point is.”"
31,16,>The only reason the government actually does something is because people are getting mad at me.
41,16,It's a joke and the government shouldn't pay for it.
52,16,"They're not allowing people to believe that they have the right to tell jokes. If people were to stop that kind of nonsense from getting to you, the CDC would have a definite stance to adopt and not follow what the article says."
55,16,What's the difference between the US sexist joke and the fact that the ACA isn't as energizing as the ACA? Probably one of the reasons why people in our country still don't wear masks.
60,16,No one said it was a joke.
61,16,>The NRA is being sabotaged by the government. They aren't a government agency.
72,16,"The AMA is a joke and that isn't why I would care for it. I think a better way to say it is as a joke as this isn't because of the AMA, which is not a joke. I don't think a AMA is an attack on the idea of a government. It's not a joke. It's an attack on the idea of the government that wants to stop the spread of a virus. They can say no, but this is an AMA."
78,16,"""The idea of a vaccination in the US is not really a joke because there isn't much they can do in that regard."""
84,16,"This is a r/employee issue, and the whole idea of it is to make a political joke about the president of the United States. The president of Georgia and the CDC have been in the position for quite some time, but it seems the current administration doesn't feel that way about it."
85,16,"i think you are correct about the reason the government is trying to protect people. I believe it's because the fact is that the ACA is designed to protect people, but the idea that people need to wear a mask does not make me think it's not a joke or a joke."
92,16,There is no right or wrong to fire someone for wearing a mask. There is no right or wrong to fire anyone for wearing a mask.
16,1,"i would have quit in the future, if the federal government tried to kill me."
16,15,"No one is going to say it was a joke. You are being a joke, the AMA and the AMA are not related and don't make any real mention of ACA."
18,16,CANNOTANSWER EDIT: So a piece of media is trying to convince me that the CDC has to have the power to ban the virus...
29,16,It's not racist. It's racist. You're in a racist subreddit.
31,16,This is a pretty stupid joke.
41,16,There's no reassuring thing to say.
52,16,"""Hey, I'm sorry, I don't know the language."""
55,16,Vaccination is essential to stopping the spread of a virus.
60,16,The only person who can get vaccinated is a person who was sick for 5 years before the vaccine was a thing.
61,16,Vaccination isn't a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's not a joke. The government isn't allowing it.
72,16,CANNOTANSWER OP?
78,16,"I'm sure it's a good joke. There's a lot of interesting information on there and the entire ACA was a joke, and it is also going to be a big deal for some countries. So you'd have to look at that before you start talking about that."
84,16,"I think the joke is that ""smoking nutjob"" is the word you're looking for when trying to get the people of a particular party to say ""smoking nutjob""', ""I've heard the whole thing."", ""...and now you've got the nutjob joke."""
85,16,It is really interesting that it is going to have a lot more ramifications than it should.
92,16,There's also an issue about the people getting a mask. Then there is the problem with why we should let people do whatever they want to do.
16,1,"he needs to read the entire post before he thinks about how he wants to end up with the problem of what he's actually referring to, i don't want him to get sick, he needs to stop saying it"
16,15,"It's a joke because it was supposed to be about a joke, but it's not. That's a joke."
18,16,This isn't a joke.
29,16,Isn't this a joke about people who wear masks and who don't use them?
31,16,"I'd say, I would be happy if I had a choice. My dad's attitude has been very bad and he's a big no-no. We've always acted in a way that's not in keeping with the truth and I can see why. I think he's a little bit selfish. I think he's just looking for some kind of alternative and he just doesn't see it. He's not a jerk and I don't see any point that a joke, I have no intention of"
41,16,"""What's the point of the article?"""
52,16,"I feel like this is a good premise, but if the government would be forced to do the same as you do, they'd just cut the money out."
55,16,The only people who would wear a mask would be the ones who would do it if they are in the wrong place.
60,16,This is a joke - they are trying to use the CDC to try and cut down on the spread of the virus. Vaccines aren't legally allowed anymore. They aren't going to help combat the spread of the virus.
61,16,>(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CannotAmend-a-Mallet-Block).
72,16,Why do I even feel bad for you because you seem so resentful of the person you are interviewing and whose views are you judging?
78,16,"I’m not the biggest fan of the ACA. It’s really stupid to try and keep people safe in a state where they have to be on one handed. I think the ACA should stop being a joke. It is not, but it should be a joke."
84,16,"What about ""the joke is..."
85,16,"Then there is this guy who does not actually know what the ACA is. He does not know what the ACA is, or what the CDC is doing to stop a virus that is going to spread. He knows that the ACA is to stop the spread of a virus because it's supposed to be used to prevent people from getting vaccinated."
92,16,This is a common misconception and is based on the fact that the EPA does not have the authority to prevent the spread of a virus and that they should be firing people for doing so without a mask.
16,1,"""Why are the people saying this?"""
16,15,People who think they are entitled to the safety of themselves and the rights of others are being dragged on the other side.
18,16,"The government is promoting a vaccine, and the CDC is not. They are trying to use it to get sick people sick. That's not a joke. The CDC is not responsible for stopping and stopping the spread of the virus. The article is about a joke. Vaccination is not a joke."

61,16,The US has a problem with skunks and other diseases. It's not just the CDC. It's the US government's.
72,16,"I think the best thing i can say is that I am a fan of the government and do not think the article is a joke, but that the article isn't."

16,15,I believe the AMA is about the ACA. It's not a joke. But it's about a joke.
18,16,This is not a joke. It is a joke.
29,16,There's a lot of information out there on the CDC. It's just that the federal government is the source of this. I can't think of a single source that gives the CDC a list of places to put a mask on and how many of them use it. The only thing I can think of is to put it on my hat.
31,16,"In a video where you're being used as an example of a joke, you're being re-interpreted."

78,16,That's actually really hard to argue with. I'm not sure why this is being downvoted. That's the whole point.

78,16,The problem with the ACA is that it's a joke and it doesn't make sense for the CDC to repeal it. Certainly not to stop people from getting sick and getting a vaccine.
84,16,''The nutjob joke'' is an amazing joke that has nothing to do with the current presidential system.
85,16,No one has ever made a joke of a president that isn't wearing a mask. The reason the people have it is because he is an ignorant dick who's a jerk.
92,16,"It's not that the whole thing isn't a joke, it's that it isn't funny. And if you're like, ""Why is it a joke?"" (An article in a subreddit)?"

16,15,Is the AMA a joke?
18,16,It’s a good joke but not a joke. It’s a joke.
29,16,The one I've heard most often is that when a person is wearing a mask (even a 'wrong' mask) they're usually not concerned that they might spread the disease. It's a joke in and of itself.
31,16,"I like to think that's a joke, but that's an opinion piece."
41,16,"AMA. What the author wrote, is a joke."
52,16,"So, after reading the story, he said that he would like to wear a mask because he hates being insulted by his brother, and was a fan of his favorite political cartoons, and wants to wear a mask and protect his brother's self-confidence?"
55,16,I think the President's point is that wearing a mask is the most important thing to prevent a virus. That's a joke.
60,16,The only time I've seen a joke in the article is when I saw an AMA a few weeks ago about a hunch and the joke being the joke.
61,16,"Yes, it's a prank. The CDC and NRA have no authority over the health care system. They have no authority to stop people from dying from the virus."
72,16,"If you read the title, he's referencing the phrase ""People don't like to hear things like ""I like you and I love you"" (the phrase that comes to mind)."
78,16,The one hand policy was meant to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS. The ACA was repealed because it was intended to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS.

29,16,"It’s pretty obvious that this one of the most offensive things I’ve ever heard about the CDC is a joke about people wearing a mask to prevent the spread of a virus. This is a joke about what was and was in the national curriculum, the ACA and, of course, the health care act. It’s also a joke about how we’ve not had much access to the health care in many countries. That’s one of the main reasons for them having the CDC."
31,16,It's about the joke. People who are not the government are not going to understand this.
41,16,CANNOTANSWER: I’m a pretty liberal conservative. I think that what the article is about is the biggest threat he’s had to take on the EPA.
52,16,"They have said that this is a joke, that if they would tell the joke in a genuine way, people would see it as a joke and would look to the people who are in the same position as the person who was in the mask. This is not a joke."
55,16,I can't make that distinction because I don't get why people think this is a joke - but I don't really get why people think the article is a joke.
60,16,"I'd be very annoyed at the fact that you're just saying that if it were just a joke, it's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke."
