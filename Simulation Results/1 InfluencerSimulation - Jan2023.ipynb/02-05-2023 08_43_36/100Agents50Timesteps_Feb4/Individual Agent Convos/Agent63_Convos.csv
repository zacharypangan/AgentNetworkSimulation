77,63,two tri county health dept board members from douglas county voted against the mask public health order and one did not vote due to affiliation to a school
78,63,how does the mask make his breath come out of the back of his head
99,63,oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that
63,1,> How does the mask make his breath come out of the back of his head
63,3,A lot of things have been going wrong. People are sick and have been doing nothing wrong. Now it looks like everyone has a mask on.
63,8,"They've gotta stop it, because the first one, the first one, was sooo contagious"
63,10,He said his eyes had a virus on them...
63,14,"How can you be in the newest strain, it seems like a reoccurring illness, as there are several known strains and their tidbits can be a reoccurring infection."
63,17,> how does the mask make his breath come out of the back of his head
63,22,The article has some interesting stuff for us to eat out at home. The news that it is a good idea to wear a mask on your hands.
63,23,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.yes the newest strain is soooooo contagious just bc they have a mask on their hands pics don t mean they re using it
63,30,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
63,34,"You know a doctor who worked in public health in a doctor's office has the latest strain of the virus but she has a mask on her hands, that makes it more contagious if you think about it.."
63,37,He is wearing a mask for no good reason.
63,39,"We all are on this earth, it doesn't matter if you are on this earth unless you are alive and you don't like it."
63,40,"So, the new strain is soooooo contagious just bc they have a mask on their hands pics don t mean they re using it how does the mask make his breath come out of the back of his head yes the newest strain is soooooo contagious just bc they have a mask on their hands pics don t mean they re using it"
63,43,Then wear it like a full face mask and it works wonders when you're dressed and don't have your hands wrapped around you.
63,47,The newest strain is soooooo contagious just bc they have a mask on their hands pics don t mean they re using it yes the newest strain is soooooo contagious just bc they have a mask on their hands pics don t mean they re using it
63,50,The fact that Maroon is wearing his mask does not mean that they are using it. I am really sorry.
63,51,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.yes the newest strain is soooooo contagious just bc they have a mask on their hands pics don t mean they re using it
63,56,Then that's what I'm trying to avoid. Wearing a mask on your hands is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
63,57,"The mask on the head is a medical device worn by the government, and so it is a good way to prevent the spread."
63,60,We gotta fuck ourselves and stop pretending to be the next king of the health department...
65,63,"I want to talk about wearing a mask to stop the spread of a virus, but I think it's useless."
76,63,"Yes, it is a sign that they are having fun in their lives, whether that is wearing a mask, or wearing a mask, because the people who take it haven't done much to stop it."
77,63,i read that this was a joke by a guy that i lived with in dc and he said his parents were sick and that he had to attend school because he thought they had a terrible cough
78,63,Wearing a mask helps in stopping the spread of a virus.
99,63,i was trying to put that in context but it wasn't quite right
63,1,You have no idea what the newest strain of the virus is? Does he even have the virus on his hands? Does he have it on his hands? Does it contain any bacteria?
63,3,"I love how the movie I live in, has a pretty good movie and the guy is hilarious."
63,8,"We're not going to stop it, but it isn't a vaccine if you've got a virus. We can't stop it."
63,10,"They're not on their hands. They're on their heads, which is why they get so sick."
63,14,"I read the article to a friend about wearing a mask. I had a cough, it came out of his mouth, but my throat wasn't so bad as I assumed it was a virus. It came out from his throat."
63,17,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
63,22,i think its useless that maroon and mcdonalds are avoiding the same problem
63,23,Wearing a mask helps in stopping the spread of a virus.
63,30,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
63,34,"A man on a motorcycle who is taking a virus has a mask on his hand that works wonders when he's walked on his back. A guy who was wearing a mask at my high school in Wisconsin and was a typhoon virus fan, is wearing a mask on his hand, and is wearing a mask on his hands as a sign that he doesn't want to be sick. He is wearing a mask for no reason. Wearing a mask on his hands helps in stopping the spread of a virus. He also says that a"
63,37,The fact that Maroon is wearing his mask does not mean that they are using it. Then wear it like a full face mask and it works wonders when you're dressed and don't have your hands wrapped around you.
63,39,The whole reason the virus is so sick is because it makes us all think that the person in charge of the virus is just going to get it and that the person that isn't at risk of it is simply not ready for it to develop.
63,40,... But they wear a mask on their hands.
63,43,Unless you grew up with a bunch of rats (like in the CDC and with a bunch of other diseases).
63,47,"People in the US aren't really talking about how this is a ""bad idea"" and just don't think about it. People who are not concerned are the ones who are pointing out that a ""bad idea"" is better than a ""bad idea"" because they think it's the worst idea that they have on the brain. Those people seem to think the ""bad idea"" was bad and were pointing out that ""bad idea"" is better than ""bad idea""."
63,50,I'm in my 20s and I'm going to go to school with a mask on.
63,51,"It isn't a bad idea, but you're implying that the current strain of the virus is soooooo contagious they're not actually infecting other people. So there are some pretty good examples that the recent strain is very contagious. It's not as if people in the U.S. are at all, but the idea that it's actually not is just silly."
63,56,The fact that Maroon is wearing his mask does not mean that they are using it.
63,57,"I was thinking that because of his facial hair, we could not protect him from the virus."
63,60,"My girlfriend said her father took the newest strain of the virus and he is really worried about it, but she still has it on her and it's not a virus."
65,63,"I think it's useless, because it's necessary to keep people alive."
76,63,"I'm not a fan of the stuff that comes in at this point, but the 'Newton virus' is the best kind of virus for any person. We don't want people to think that we have enough people to put their own clothes on if they don't wear masks."
77,63,This is not how the federal government is supposed to deal with this.
78,63,It's been mentioned in a bit of the video that it's the first time I've heard of this...
99,63,I'm not saying it's wrong or that it's a good idea or that it's just a bad idea or bad idea but a nice way of presenting it to a person.
63,1,"It is in my blood, as well as all my clothes. I can barely wear them without getting infected."
63,3,... The fact that Maroon is wearing his mask does not mean that they are using it. Then wear it like a full face mask and it works wonders when you're dressed and don't have your hands wrapped around you. The whole reason the virus is sooo contagious they're not actually infecting other people.
63,8,Well that is ridiculous. Vaccines are not just good for your health. It's only for people who have an interest in a disease that you can't seem to prevent in terms of virus and its severity.
63,10,This is not a good idea.
63,14,Wearing a mask helps prevent a virus. It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
63,17,I'm assuming it was the CDC that spotted the newton virus and made the decision to wear a mask?
63,22,"I grew up with a bunch of rats, and my mother took a strain of the Virus. It was contagious. I never got it but I thought I was pregnant. I'm a little sad."
63,23,It is not like a mask is the first thing the public is going to erect on the street.
63,30,"If the government is trying to protect someone who is a bit sick by getting rid of the virus, there will be a lot more people getting bitten by the virus."
63,34,"They don't know if it's a virus. They're assuming it's not a virus, they're just asking for a sign that they know what it is and they're not putting it on their hands."
63,37,A guy who was taking a virus has a mask on his hand that works wonders when he's walked on his back.
63,39,"This is like saying how doctors are putting on the'shelter' to prevent viruses from spreading, and you just can't really tell them from the signs and how they're going to use them."
63,40,It's not the first time I've heard of this.
63,43,"Well, I know that he's probably not really a big virus fan. I'm just more into his mental health and he's been wearing a mask for years, so I don't think it's that bad."
63,47,"I'm not a fan of the stuff that comes in at this point, but the Newton virus is the best kind of virus for any person."
63,50,"You aren't crazy, this sounds like a stupid idea, but I really don't want to sound guilty because you're not the one who wants to wear it on your hands."
63,51,"They are attempting to combat the spread of the virus through people, not masks."
63,56,"The fact that Maroon is wearing his mask does not mean that they are using it. Then wear it like a full face mask and it works wonders when you're dressed and don't have your hands wrapped around you. The whole reason the virus is so sick is because it makes us all think that the person in charge of the virus is just going to get it and that the person that isn't at risk of it is simply not ready for it to develop. I think it's useless, because it's necessary to keep people alive."
63,57,"I wore a floppy tiara last week. I took it to school, it was pretty damn good, and it was just great. Now it's pretty funny how many people wear floppy masks and can't even get them out of their clothes, even if they weren't at home. It's like a band aid."
63,60,"The CDC are threatening to make sure no one gets caught by the virus. If they are, they cann't be held responsible. They can put a mask on to prevent them from being infected if they do not put it on."
65,63,You can't keep your mouth open and a virus is a disease. But you can't prevent a disease if your mouth closes and the virus is pushed in.
76,63,My favorite -crst post ever.
77,63,"> he said his parents were sick and that he had to attend school because he thought they had a terrible cough',"
78,63,I don't know much about the medical side of things. I'm just curious about the government trying to stop people from wearing masks. I don't think it would be a joke. The idea of people wearing masks will only lead to more people getting HIV/AIDS.
99,63,Vaccination is actually pretty good for preventing the spread of a virus.
63,1,CDC was the one that spotted the newton virus and made the decision to wear a mask. It is not like they were putting on a mask because they wanted to stop the spread of the virus.
63,3,"I am a big fan of the CDC and it is a good idea to put on a mask. I was in a lab with them and I was having a lot of difficulty getting it off, and I wanted to have a mask on."
63,8,They're threatening to prevent the spread of a virus by putting on a mask. Vaccination is actually pretty good for preventing the spread of a virus.
63,10,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
63,14,I'm going to go ahead and defend the CDC's decision. They are trying to make it so that you don't get the first thing you hear about a virus.
63,17,"The CDC deems it 'unhealthy' to use a mask to keep people alive, even if it makes them feel better. The people being infected will not make them sick, they're just going to be getting sick."
63,22,"I thought a virus was contagious, but I was so upset."
63,23,So... why does everyone wear a mask?
63,30,"It's really silly and ridiculous, it's almost as if people have no idea what a virus is. I mean, it's probably just the fact that you're so sick of people wishing to live and that they're sick, but that's the only way they're going to be infected."
63,34,"It is pretty obvious that you're an anti-virus expert, and that your current policy is to avoid exposing your family and friends to a specific type of virus. It's not very surprising that your parents thought this was a sign of a symptom."
63,37,They are doing so with the'shelter'
63,39,"There are other things that can be done to keep people alive, such as wearing a mask on your hands and a tiara. But the government is doing something that should be done to keep people alive."
63,40,"You know, the one that made me laugh the hardest was how they wore a mask that didn't work. But they said that it was a good idea and that they are attempting to make sure no one gets caught by it."
63,43,As someone who recently got a tiara I don't think this is a bad idea. It looks like the CDC erects masks around all public buildings for people who want to wear them.
63,47,I don't think that is a bad idea.
63,50,"Unless someone's a troll, I'd say that they have absolutely zero respect for the public health. But the truth is that it's possible they don't wear masks at school. That's a fucked up idea."
63,51,"I have had one for a long time, I'm so glad it helped me get through it and have no other side effects to go on."
63,56,"The only people that have HIV/AIDS who do not wear a mask are people with dementia and depression. It's just a symptom of the disease, and in most cases that does not occur. People who do not have a face mask often do not go to the doctor or to have someone put on their mask."
63,57,So why do we have to erect a mask on my mom? We have an infected guy with the virus.
63,60,I'm assuming it was the CDC that spotted the newton virus and made the decision to wear a mask.
65,63,There is actually a law that the government can put people in for more than three days without being allowed in.
76,63,"If they are not wearing masks, the other guys are. If they are, they aren't ok if the other guy has the virus in them."
77,63,I live in California. We have the rules. I've heard of the rule.
78,63,"I don't like how you aren't using the word ""sarcastic"" to describe this, you're using the word ""dick"". That's a sarcastic one."
99,63,This is why a lot of the commenters are not as sensitive to women as other commenters are to the mask.
63,1,"It's pretty obvious that you're an anti-virus expert, and that they are attempting to make sure no one gets caught by the virus."
63,3,"Unless someone's a troll, I'd say that they have absolutely zero respect for the public health."
63,8,">I think it's really silly and ridiculous, it's almost as if people have zero respect for the public health."
63,10,"The problem with the government is that it is deemed unhealthy to use a mask to keep people alive even if it makes them feel better. The people being infected will not make them sick, they're just going to be getting sick."
63,14,"In California it's not just the CDC, they're the same thing, but they're the same thing. I'm in CA and we have rules on how people wear masks in public buildings and can't use them at school or work."
63,17,>There is actually a law that the government can put people in for more than three days without being allowed in.
63,22,I am a bit sick of the CDC making the people a troll. They do not seem to understand the issue.
63,23,It seems like a lot of the commenters are not as sensitive to women as other commenters are to the mask.
63,30,Is it possible that someone's not as sick of people wishing to live and that they're sick? Because that's a very valid point.
63,34,...I don't know about that.
63,37,I'm an anti-virus expert and I have a few stories.
63,39,It's a sad thing. I've had no idea what the CDC did to keep people alive.
63,40,You just have a mask in your tiara?
63,43,In my country the only one that got it is the only person who has it. This makes no sense because it seems like it's an expensive idea.
63,47,A mask is a mask that you put on to prevent a virus that is causing you ill. This is one of the best ways to get it out.
63,50,I don't know much about people who get HIV/AIDS but I just read the title from the context of his post. It's not a good idea for him to be mentioning it.
63,51,"You are using the word ""sarcasm"" incorrectly."
63,56,"If you've snooped into a CDC meeting and you're not aware what a ""shelter"" is, you probably have the virus."
63,57,I'm pretty sure the one in my class who got a mask at an event had a virus and thought it would spread. I was trying to make someone feel better about the guy who got infected :)
63,60,"I've never heard of the term ""Mask for it"" in any way, so I don't understand why people want to hear it when their parents aren't actually wearing them."
65,63,"I have the full set of vacks mandates, and I like how you have them all."
76,63,You can get tested for this virus at the pharmacy you work at. The doctor will tell you how to get vaccinated and how to have the infection removed.
77,63,"I don't get the full story but I've seen it. It was just that I was a teacher who had been wearing a mask at school, and the fact that she had no access to a public health facility that wasn't a normal thing to say."
78,63,he said he would be surprised if they had just put a mask on the neck and not wear them in the public - I mean he actually felt better and didn't even get sick from wearing it. I would like to think that I was wrong.
99,63,"They do not need to get anyone to wear a mask, they need to have their doctor to do it. It's a very stupid thing to say about what people don't want to know."
63,1,I'm very interested in what your doctor recommends when talking about the CDC's work on the prevention of spread of HIV/AIDS.
63,3,"Apparently they want to stop people from getting HIV/AIDS. Besides, if it's contagious, then everyone needs to be infected."
63,8,"Vaccines are a terrible way to protect people. You don't get to have the right to get tested for a disease by putting on a mask, but you do have a right to be sick, and this is what the CDC is doing to prevent it."
63,10,>I am a bit sick of the CDC making the people a troll. They do not seem to understand the issue. It seems like a lot of the commenters are not as sensitive to women as other commenters are to the mask.
63,14,I'm trying to defend the CDC's decision. They are trying to make it so that you don't get the first thing you hear about a virus.
63,17,CANNOTANSWER](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canons/Canons/Canons/Canons.html) is a pretty good summary of the CDC's methods and their recommendations for the prevention of HIV/AIDS.
63,22,I think the people who are really into HIV/AIDS are ignorant of it.
63,23,"He spelled that out in the context of his comment as being in the context of what is supposed to be a very interesting subject, and it sounds like this should have gone a different way."
63,30,I'd really like to have you know this.
63,34,"The CDC makes you uncomfortable. They are a private body with no mandate, and you aren't going to get to make that decision. They're not doing anything for you, they're just trying to keep you safe. It's really not that surprising that he wasn't even talking to your parents, and they didn't have to help him."
63,37,"The government wants you to be infected. It isn't that easy, there is a law to prevent people from being infected. The people stating a virus is actually part of a federal law that protects from the spread. Those laws aren't very effective."
63,39,"OP, you're using the word'sarcasm' incorrectly."
63,40,I'm not a CDC expert but I've heard this before.
63,43,"I'm not a big HIV fan but I know people who have gotten the virus. I don't want to hear it, and I don't want to be around people who grew up with a bunch of rats."
63,47,"This is not about the virus, it's about the virus being spread through the body."
63,50,People are more likely to be sick from wearing a mask than from a virus that has spread to the people who are sick. Especially if they get infected to prevent future illnesses.
63,51,"""They are attempting to combat the spread of the virus through people, not masks."""
63,56,A mask is a mask that you put on to prevent a virus that is causing you to become sick.
63,57,"He said he did not get any of the benefits of wearing a mask, he was just trying to have a conversation with someone who was a troll."
63,60,People wear a mask to keep people alive because people are infected with HIV/AIDS.
65,63,'There is actually a law that the government can put people in for more than three days without being allowed in.
76,63,As a health worker I was concerned when I heard that you have a very common type of infection called a Newton virus that the government is threatening to kill.
77,63,The premise of a mask isn't to stop people from spreading a virus.
78,63,"i would like to think that I was wrong. It's called ""Assisting the spread of a virus"" as I think it is."
99,63,This is the point that you're making.
63,1,I don't know why I think you have the same problem as OP. But I think it's not a stupid premise.
63,3,They're not doing anything for the public. And no. The CDC has no mandate to prevent people from getting HIV/AIDS.
63,8,I'm really curious as to what kind of people do you like to talk to?
63,10,> He said his eyes had a virus on them...
63,14,">I read the article to a friend about wearing a mask. I had a cough, it came out of his mouth, but my throat wasn't so bad as I assumed it was a virus. It came out from his throat.''"
63,17,He was being a troll. His first line is: 'how do the people being infected do not make them sick? They just want to keep them alive.'
63,22,"I can understand people not understanding the problem, but the CDC makes you uncomfortable by making him a troll. He said he was trying to try to explain that it is actually to prevent the spread of the virus and that he could not possibly be the one to have a conversation with someone who has had a conversation about it."
63,23,Is this a personal opinion? Or are you a public health worker?
63,30,"[NAME] has a joke. (Mental infections like these aren't common) ""If you were sick from wearing a mask, you wouldn't be infected to keep yourself alive."""
63,34,"In a similar way, when someone said ""a man on a motorcycle who is taking a virus has a mask on his hand that works wonders when he's walked on his back."", he said ""...I don't know about that.""."
63,37,'I'm an anti-virus expert and I have a few stories.'
63,39,"I've been in the U.S. for more than 2 years, I know you can't get the virus without your mask and a mask. Is this the same thing we've done to prevent the spread of the virus?"
63,40,"[Wild is important], 'Making masks to prevent spreading of a virus is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
63,43,">The CDC is attempting to combat the spread of the virus through people, not masks."
63,47,"So this is what I was referring to if I was talking to someone. I was just making a joke, I was referring to the fact that the CDC has no mandate to protect people, so he can't be seen in public. I was just trying to make sure someone was aware of the CDC's methods and recommendations for the prevention of HIV/AIDS."
63,50,No one is being sarcastic. And he has a fucked up idea. His premise is to combat the spread of the virus through people. Is he not a troll?
63,51,"The CDC makes you uncomfortable. They are a private body with no mandate, and you aren't going to get to make that decision. They are not doing anything for you, they're just trying to keep you safe."
63,56,... and they... Are attempting to prevent this spread through masks? That's not a very good point.
63,57,"It's an interesting question because I'm not a major anti-HIV advocate, so it's not unusual for me to see this comment in a similar light."
63,60,CDC is not a private body with no mandate.
65,63,I'd go on for a second and go on with my life.
76,63,"Vaccination isn't a medical necessity, it's a necessity. It's the only way a patient dies, it's the way a patient is vaccinated and not their health. I'm a doctor. The vaccine is required for me. If they are not wearing masks, the other guys are. If they are, they aren't ok if the other guy has the virus in them. I'm a doctor. The vaccine is required for me. If they aren't wearing masks, I don't have"
77,63,"The idea of a mask isn't to stop people from spreading a virus. What they are proposing is for a school to have a'separate'school that does not allow anyone to be inside and outside, thus potentially causing people to be unwell."
78,63,There isn't enough information in here that supports that
99,63,"I have a copy of the CDC article that says it's not a joke, but a joke..."
63,1,"What a mess. Why do you think the CDC is a troll? The government is trying to cut off the CDC and keep them out of the public eye. They're doing the right thing, as far as I'm concerned."
63,3,"They don't need to protect people, they need the public. But they need to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS from others. It is the same way you are asking."
63,8,The CDC is trying to prevent the spread of AIDS by putting on a mask. A mask is required. But there is nothing in the article that says it is a joke.
63,10,"I am not a medical doctor, but i see this as a problem for a lot of people. The government is a private body with no mandate. The issue is with those who rely on the private bodies to try and prevent the spread of the virus, not the person who can be seen on the streets. The people who do know are not immune to the CDC, and they are not aware of it."
63,14,I know people are in a similar situation when the CDC is not a private body with no mandate.
63,17,"They're putting people in quarantines in cases of illness. If they're not in quarantines, then it isn't even possible for the vaccine to have been used."
63,22,"I'm a health professional, and this is definitely the kind of thing that makes people uncomfortable about it."
63,23,... and they... Are attempting to prevent this spread through masks? That's not a very good point.
63,30,"The CDC is trying to combat the spread of HIV/AIDS through people, not masks. It doesn't seem like it's going to stop it. It's going to help with some of the most difficult and insidious ways possible."
63,34,"The article states: ""This is a joke. "". Is that what I was referring to?"
63,37,> Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.He was being a troll.
63,39,"A doctor, and a public health worker."
63,40,"""The CDC is attempting to combat the spread of the virus through people, not masks."
63,43,>Making masks to prevent the spread of a virus is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
63,47,>His first line is: 'how do the people being infected do not make them sick? They just want to keep them alive.'
63,50,">the CDC makes you uncomfortable. They are a private body with no mandate, and you aren't going to get to make that decision. They are not doing anything for you, they're just trying to keep you safe."
63,51,"I'd really like to ask you if you have a copy of the article that says it's not a joke, but a joke."
63,56,This seems like a troll on purpose.
63,57,"He was being sarcastic, because he is a troll. The fact that he was trying to explain that it is actually to prevent the spread of a virus does not make him a troll. He also claims that they aren't doing anything for the prevention of the spread of a virus."
63,60,"The CDC is threatening to make sure no one gets caught by the virus, but if they are, they can't be held responsible. So he is making a troll joke. He is not a troll."
65,63,I don't know what to say but I'd go on for a second. The whole reason you want to be a teacher is because you're a teacher is because you're in a school and you know nothing about a school and that you just need a mask for your job.
76,63,"I don't want the CDC to keep getting in control of the health care system, I want the FDA to do it if needed."
77,63,"I don't think it's a joke, that it's supposed to be funny."
78,63,"OP, the idea is not ridiculous and the problem is that people who wear a mask aren't in the minority."
99,63,">I think you can't just say ""oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that"" Vaccination is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I think you can't just say ""oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that"" Vaccination is actually pretty good for preventing the spread of a virus."
63,1,"In a nutshell: The fact that he was being sarcastic, because he is a troll."
63,3,"It seems like he's joking. I'd like to ask you if you have a copy of the article that says it's not a joke, but a joke."
63,8,"I think the joke is because I'm a health professional and I can't even remember what the word for it is, but I can't remember what the term for it was in my head."
63,10,This post was written by a doctor who was sick of people getting sick from being under a mask.
63,14,You seem to be getting the wrong kind of joke. People don't need a mask. Vaccination is actually pretty good for preventing the spread of a virus.
63,17,>The whole reason you want to be a teacher is because you're in a school and you know nothing about a school and that you just need a mask for your job.
63,22,I am a health professional. I am sure that I understand people not understanding the problem.
63,23,Why do you want to work in a school with a CDC?
63,30,"In that video, he talks about how it's putting people in quarantines when they get sick."
63,34,"> The CDC is trying to combat the spread of HIV/AIDS through people, not masks."
63,37,> He also claims that they aren't doing anything for the prevention of the spread. They are not doing anything for the prevention of the spread. They aren't doing anything for the prevention of the spread. They are not doing anything for the prevention of the spread.
63,39,"A troll with a joke on purpose? No, this is a troll."
63,40,And that's just because the article says that.
63,43,"I don't think the CDC would want to put the CDC at risk for some sort of vaccine, or have a stance that people should wear their masks unless the government explicitly mandates them to."
63,47,"If it's a joke that isn't a joke, it's a troll fad if you ask me. This is why I'm a schoolteacher and I don't have a problem with vaccinating people who don't have a mask. Vaccination is not a bad idea but it doesn't work. It's just bad for preventing spread of a virus."
63,50,"The issue that plagues the people who get HIV/AIDS, and the reason it spreads through their hands, is that it's extremely harmful, and their mouths and hands are reliant on contaminated foods for contamination. The more people there are on it, the more likely it will spread. Vaccination is actually pretty good for preventing the spread of a virus, especially in the schools and hospitals. I don't think I've seen any videos of people who have a very good fear of that virus. I think I'm a really good thing that is able to keep"
63,51,I think this is kind of funny. What's the point of a CDC employee? You have no idea how that goes? The CDC has been trying to stop the spread of the virus through masks for years?
63,56,"I'm a medical professional, and this is definitely the kind of thing that makes people uncomfortable about it....and they... Are attempting to prevent this spread through masks? That's not a very good point."
63,57,">I'm a health professional, and this is definitely the kind of thing that makes people uncomfortable about it.... and they... Are attempting to prevent this spread through masks? That's not a very good point."
63,60,"The point of the article is that this is a joke, not that it's a troll joke."
65,63,I had a teacher in one of my psych programs that had a mask for everyone. He said they had to have the vaccine but not wear the mask in school. It was a joke. He just wanted to help someone and it doesn't seem to work.
76,63,I'm a big anti-vaccine fan and have been on this list all my life. It's a fucking joke.
77,63,"If the teachers can't support a ban on it, then the public health department would probably be shit about this."
78,63,"There's nothing more scary about the idea of the mask being on the neck than how they have to do it for the sake of being part of the government's program. That being said, it is really funny that they are trying to make people wear their masks, it is very unlikely they can get their own."
99,63,>The CDC is blaming women wearing masks because they can't get their child vaccinated and that means that if they didn't know the facts about their child they would get their child vaccinated.
63,1,I'm a doctor so I'm not sure I understand the story. I'm very concerned about this and I'm very interested in what your doctor recommends when talking about the CDC's work on the prevention of spread of HIV/AIDS.
63,3,It's not a joke. They're just trying to prevent people from getting that virus.
63,8,"Yes, it's funny because the article is a troll."
63,10,"It sounds like the article is just a hoax. I understand how this is a troll joke, but this is not. It's a bad joke, and not a good one. It's kind of like a troll joke that you're a medical professional and it's a joke. It's just not a joke."
63,14,"A lot of doctors have said it is a bad idea to have a mask on, but it does not mean the vaccine will be the first thing they hear about. They can make some crazy statements."
63,17,[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canons/Canons/Canons.html) is a pretty good summary of the CDC's methods and recommendations for the prevention of HIV/AIDS.
63,22,They are getting the idea of vaccines at the same time a new generation gets them.
63,23,"The CDC's policy is to prevent people from getting infected with HIV. If the CDC does something similar, then they may as well let someone else get the vaccine. If they can't, they will end up with a list of all the anti-vaccine and anti-vaccination jokes tagged as ""fake-vaccination jokes""."
63,30,"I know what you mean. I just realised that this is going to make people uncomfortable, and I just wanted to say something... I don't see a need to think about this."
63,34,"""This is a joke, not that it's a troll joke."""
63,37,"There is a bunch of ""We're putting people in quarantines at schools"" jokes here. Those are from someone else, and you may have missed the main point."
63,39,I'm a medical professional. I've had a little idea how I would feel if I knew a person who had HIV.
63,40,"Vaccination is actually pretty good for preventing the spread of a virus, especially in the schools and hospitals."
63,43,Vaccination is not a bad idea but it doesn't work. Vaccination isn't just about preventing the spread of a virus. It's also about preventing the spread of a virus. It's a good idea but they're not going to take a back seat to protecting the public.
63,47,"As a teacher, I genuinely have no problem with getting my child vaccinated. I want to get out of this situation and I want to be better at it."
63,50,"I don't know what I know about the current state of HIV/AIDS, but I have read many articles about people who are getting sick from it."
63,51,"I’m a school teacher and I’m sure that I understand people not understanding the problem. Why do you want to work in a school with a CDC? In that video, he talks about how it's putting people in quarantines when they get sick. He also claims that they aren’t doing anything for the prevention of the spread. They aren’t doing anything for the prevention of the spread. They aren’t doing anything for the prevention of the spread."
63,56,>The whole reason you want to be a schoolteacher is because you're in a school and you know nothing about a school and that you just need a mask for your job. I am sure that I understand people not understanding the problem. Why do you want to work in a school with a CDC?
63,57,Vaccination is only one of two things.
63,60,You're putting all the people of the world in quarantines.
65,63,I'm glad that my post can be upvoted to the top of this thread. It's pretty good in a lot of ways.
76,63,Is the government trying to get on the list if it's gonna be a joke?
77,63,"What a joke, huh? I'm glad the CDC is stepping up for me!"
78,63,"""I think it was a joke. It was just an idea. It wasn't a law. They said that this was a joke. It was just an idea. It wasn't a law. They said that this was a joke and they wanted to stop the spread."
99,63,"Assuming the vaccine does not stop an epidemic of malaria or any other type of disease, it doesn't make it a joke at all. Vaccination isn't required by the government and is illegal. They are the most liberal and progressive anti-vaccine movement."
63,1,"I don't see how the government would put a troll in the first place... but I don't see how the CDC is trying to cut off the CDC, they're trying to cut off the CDC, and they're trying to cut them out of the public eye, as far as I'm concerned."
63,3,"In my experience, people will put the government's vaccinations policies behind their policies and it's very hard to put them back on the list."
63,8,"""Well that is ridiculous. Vaccines aren't just good for your health. It's only for people who have an interest in a disease that you can't seem to prevent in terms of severity."""
63,10,"I'd like to be informed, but a medical professional who hasn't been educated on the topic at all. I see this is not a joke. The guy who wrote that is a good idea."
63,14,"The last line is really, really funny. If I had a cough, I'd start wearing a mask."
63,17,I'm really glad you're on the side of the vaccines a lot. This is an anti-vaccine joke that's getting more and more attention.
63,22,"It's also been reported that the virus will spread in other countries as well, as is the case with other diseases. The virus is just going to spread."
63,23,"""We're putting people in quarantines at schools"" is a good joke."
63,30,"I am not saying it is a troll joke, but it is a joke that the CDC wants to stop the spread of this virus. They can't do anything about it, they're just trying to prevent the spread. They are trying to stop the spread and they're not doing anything about it."
63,34,"I don't know what you mean, but I think the point is that the CDC is using the CDC as a platform to spread the virus, not a public health agency."
63,37,"So... the CDC, the CDC, CDC, the CDC, and the other government agencies are just trying to stop the spread of HIV. That's all they need to stop. Isn't the same as asking someone if they can stop the spread?"
63,39,"Vaccination is a good idea, but it isn’t required by the government, and it doesn’t make it illegal. You will always feel that you know what they’re doing, and it makes you feel uncomfortable if they aren’t doing something."
63,40,I don't know why people want to get the job. My wife has HIV and I just got a mask to keep me warm and keep me from getting infected.
63,43,I would not let the government take a back seat to protecting the public.
63,47,>[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canons/Canons/Canons.html) is a pretty good summary of the CDC's methods and recommendations for the prevention of HIV/AIDS. They are getting the idea of vaccines at the same time a new generation gets them.
63,50,I'm a little concerned that a lot of people would be uncomfortable doing this in schools. If I'm a teacher I'll make a point to take it seriously.
63,51,"A CDC employee could easily do this, so I think he might be off the hook. ""I don't see what a troll joke means. They aren't doing anything for you, they're just trying to keep you safe."""
63,56,"I see a lot of teachers as very religious. And to me the most important thing is to be a good person, not a troll."
63,57,"As a health professional, I'm very skeptical of the idea of an active anti-vaccination program in the US."
63,60,Why is he the first person to suggest that it should be a joke? There is no way that would make you uncomfortable.
65,63,I think that's all of my questions.
76,63,This is a joke. Why are you wearing a mask? You are wearing a mask and are the one with a face. You have a mask? Do you have a face? Because it's not just what you want to see?
77,63,"CANNOTANSWER: Wearing a mask would help stop the spread of a virus. You said that you weren't really sure the doctor was being taken to a doctor for the job of a teacher, not a doctor if you're a psych specialist....I think you're on to something."
78,63,The ACA is an effort to pass a law against skunks. This isn't a joke. It is a joke.
99,63,"The world is a joke about people with HIV. Vaccination is a joke. It is an important part of protecting children and the public from a deadly virus. You can wear a mask as a guard for your child, as long as your child is healthy, and your parents are free to do so."
63,1,I'm not sure what you mean. I don't think it's a troll joke. It isn't a joke and I don't think the government would cut it off. This is just a troll joke.
63,3,I don't think the article in the article is a joke. The article is based on the fact that a lot of the people in the article are not really accustomed to wearing a mask.
63,8,Vaccination is only good for people who have an interest in a disease that they can't seem to prevent in terms of severity. It's only good for people who have an interest in a virus that they can't seem to prevent in terms of severity.
63,10,The people saying that the mask is a joke aren't real.
63,14,Vaccination is an important part of protecting children and the public from a deadly virus.
63,17,"So your idea that your job is to protect the public from HIV is not really a joke, but rather to promote the idea that vaccination is good for your health?"
63,22,"So you are the one who actually knows the truth about HIV/AIDS. You have an infection, you are a virologist, a troll, or a liar?"
63,23,I don't know about this but I do know about some of the other jokes that the CDC is talking about.
63,30,"It's really silly, ridiculous and they're not doing anything about it. They're just trying to prevent the spread and they're not doing anything about it. I don't think it's a joke, and I would not let the government take a back seat to protecting the public."
63,34,"It is a joke. But it also doesn't make a joke, it makes a joke. A doctor with a mask might not have known that the man was wearing a mask. If someone with a mask told his parents that he doesn't know if it's a virus, he would've just told them, so he could have seen what he was getting from wearing the mask."
63,37,This is a joke. You don't know the meaning of it.
63,39,I have a friend who has one. I'm afraid it is very hard to tell her from the description of her being a medical professional. She has HIV but she's not getting the virus.
63,40,"In the world, this isn't a joke. It's a joke. The government and the health care industry are all just as bad as you'd think. It isn't a joke."
63,43,"It's the biggest joke in the history of medicine. CDC's inept methods of disarming people with HIV, and spreading it, as well as using the CDC as a platform for spreading HIV/AIDS, are often used to promote better health and wellness in people's lives."
63,47,> [How do the people being infected do not make them sick? They just want to keep them alive.'
63,50,"It's a joke. If you think this is a joke, you should think about it. What if I had a better idea..."
63,51,People get sick of the ACA. The CDC and public health institutions should be doing more to halt the spread of the virus. The CDC and private health services should work together in a way that prevents the spread of the virus. The government shouldn't be being used as a platform to spread the virus. So we should put a stop to this.
63,56,"I mean, it's a joke. That is just a joke."
63,57,I don't think the ACA should be an anti-vaccination program.
63,60,"""People wear a mask to keep people alive because people are infected with HIV/AIDS."""
65,63,"When I first started working in the US government, I grew up in an apartment where the staff had to come in when there was no virus."
76,63,This is a really common one.
77,63,A few things. I think a joke is a joke. The premise of a mask is intended to prevent a virus and can be a major threat to everyone in the health care system.
78,63,It is not a joke. The government acted by making it so that people who get AIDS can get their own.
99,63,You are not a joke.
63,1,"It is not a joke, it's just a joke. If someone is being sarcastic about the CDC, that's why they are trying to cut them off."
63,3,"I think that the article was a joke, as is the premise. And if it is a joke that the CDC is making it out to be a joke, why wouldn't you have a copy of the article?"
63,8,This is a joke. There's nothing that says it is a joke. They can't do anything about it. They just'middle the game'.
63,10,"As far as I know, this is not the joke in question."
63,14,"In the US, a joke is the definition of a joke, and a joke is the definition of a joke. A joke is when a government government act to prevent a virus. A joke is a joke."
63,17,I don't think a joke is a joke. The CDC should not have taken a back seat to stopping HIV/AIDS. I think they are not doing anything about it. It's just not funny.
63,22,"That is a joke, not a joke. This is not just a joke. The CDC is making a joke about that, not the other way around. The government acted to protect us from the CDC."
63,23,"We are dealing with an epidemic and it is very bad advice to take your time and work with an anti-vaccination organization. The CDC is going to be a tool to protect you from the spread of HIV/AIDS, which is the primary threat in the US."
63,30,Isn't this a joke? I thought it was a joke.
63,34,"So we're talking about this issue on the same side. And while I love your jokes, they seem really shady as well."
63,37,"I don't want to be a troll, but I would rather be a liar, like the person who was being a troll?"
63,39,Using a mask for protection is such a good thing.
63,40,CANNOTANSWER A THING THAT I KNOW IS NOT A JIE. I KNOW NOT A JIE. I KNOW NOT A JIE. I KNOW NOT A JIE. I KNOW NOT A JIE. I KNOW THAT I KNOW NOT CANNOTANSWER THAT THE CDC ASSISTS TO SAVE FEELINGS. I KNOW NOT HIMSELFLY SAID THAT THEY HAD AIDS AND TOLD YOU WHO THE PEOPLE HAD THEY HAD AIDS A HALF HUNGER
63,43,You're being debunked. The best stance of all time is to avoid the government trying to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS.
63,47,"Vaccination is better than ""bad idea"". If you think that is a joke, it's a joke."
63,50,I can't even imagine what he's aiming at here. He has a joke...
63,51,What the CDC is trying to prevent is the spread of HIV/AIDS a lot. That and the fact that there's already a lot of research to see if it was actually spreading.
63,56,"I'm not a doctor, I'm not a doctor, I'm a doctor."
63,57,> This is a joke.
63,60,Because it is an illegal thing to use your personal ID for a personal purpose.
65,63,You have a very nice post.
76,63,i would reread this all day when my parents called me to say I'm the one who is putting me in my car.
77,63,This is a joke. The joke is just a joke. I don't think the joke is a joke.
78,63,"I'm a huge fan of the ACA, but I can understand why someone has a problem with that. I can't understand the difference between a joke and a joke. I don't like to make jokes. I find them sarcastic. And I am not sarcastic. I don't even have a sarcastic sense of humor. But I do want to help."
99,63,Why is it not a joke if it doesn't stop the spread of a deadly virus.
63,1,"If you don't like the CDC, you should definitely get out of the car."
63,3,"It's not a joke unless it's a joke, because it's an illegal thing to use your personal ID for a personal purpose."
63,8,You can go to the CDC website for the CDC's website. You can check it out - https://www.cdc.gov/ irdc/ - to find out more about the CDC's website.
63,10,I think your article is a very good one. You sound quite a bit too old to care what you are talking about. I think you should look up a better title.
63,14,"The definition of joke is the definition of a joke. It is the definition of a joke, and it means that a government is attempting to help stop the spread of a virus. You know that means that a joke is an important part of the public health and protecting people from the spread of a virus."
63,17,"It's funny to read the ""I can't believe a guy who has a mask in the US has it. CDC wants to save our lives. I have an old virus and I haven't read the ""cannot believe"" part yet."
63,22,This is not a joke. Because it is an illegal thing to use your personal ID for a personal purpose.
63,23,It's a joke. What does the CDC do? Not something you're supposed to be in a joke about?
63,30,A joke? What's the difference between a joke and a joke?
63,34,"A CDC article titled ""How do you know if a man who is taking a virus has a mask on his hand that works wonders when he's walked on his back. A man who was wearing a mask on his hand, and is wearing a mask on his hands as a sign that he doesn't want to be sick."" [In another context, that quote is just a joke. I think it's a joke because of the title, and that's why the CDC joke"
63,37,"It seems that you don't understand the difference between a joke and a joke. You're not trying to imply that you are a joke or that the government is trying to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS, but you're trying to say that they're trying to stop HIV/AIDS."
63,39,"I've always felt sarcastic to say the least. Basically: The people who have HIV are the people who will be in the hospital for a long time without knowing what it is, and they aren't even trying to protect themselves."
63,40,It sounds like the CDC is trying to make a joke about the AIDS epidemic.
63,43,I hate people who think they can't do anything to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS because the government is not protecting them.
63,47,You are being debunked. The CDC has not taken a back seat to stopping HIV/AIDS. I think they are not doing anything about it.
63,50,"I think the point here is to emphasize that the purpose of a mask is to stop the spread of an epidemic. I think it's important to acknowledge this as an issue that must be addressed, and that the fact that a joke is a joke is an important part of that."
63,51,Vaccination is better than having your health checked for a flu like it is with HIV.
63,56,"...I would rather be a liar, like the person who was being a troll."
63,57,"I was thinking about the CDC in particular but that was a joke in the sense that you can wear a mask that helps prevent the spread. You are being silly and not funny because it's not a joke, it's a joke."
63,60,"I don't think it's a joke, but I just think it's a joke. You gotta stop pretending to be the next king of the health department, right?"
65,63,I see this as a joke to be honest and give feedback to anyone who wants to help.
76,63,"As someone who was sick all my life, a sick person gets to wear a mask if they want to get vaccinated."
77,63,Is the CDC stepping up for me?
78,63,"CANNOTANSWER: The only thing I don't understand is the fact that the government is trying to make them wear a mask in public, and they are not allowed to do so is really telling."
99,63,"I had a similar conversation with someone who got a male HIV test in Mexico where they were told if the mom was having an AIDS infection, she might need to get a vaccinated asap. I was surprised how people didn't realize that the CDC was pushing it."
63,1,This is not a joke.
63,3,People have no idea what it is. But they do know a joke is the same as the original.
63,8,"It's a CDC joke, and they should be able to make that a joke based on its content. Is that what they're trying to do?"
63,10,This is a pretty cliche joke...
63,14,I'm also in CA. My friend gets the flu as a joke. I've been in the hospital for a week. We don't get it for months. He got it in September.
63,17,"It's a joke, and a joke."
63,22,"CDC was being jokes, which is why he is trying to explain that, and not make the joke."
63,23,I'm surprised that people didn't realize that the CDC is pushing this.
63,30,This is what I do when I am sick:
63,34,"""The CDC is trying to combat the spread of HIV/AIDS through people, not masks."""
63,37,They aren't trying to stop the spread of AIDS. The CDC isn't trying to stop the spread of HIV. They are trying to prevent it.
63,39,I don't think the CDC is being sarcastic here. It's a joke aimed at people who think the government is trying to stop the spread of the disease.
63,40,"The CDC is attempting to combat the spread of a virus, specifically, through people, not masks. I haven't heard of anything that sounds like a joke but I feel like I'm being really insensitive. The CDC is trying to make it a joke to stop HIV, which is why it's not a joke."
63,43,"I have HIV and I have never had anything like that happen in my life. I'm still not a doctor. I have to take meds for it to work, though."
63,47,"If you think that is a joke, it's a joke. It's not a joke."
63,50,"I've got to say, some people just haven't gotten that far."
63,51,What if the CDC is really going to stop this from happening?
63,56,"A CDC article said ""How do you know if a man who is taking a virus has a mask on his hand that works wonders when he's walked on his back. A man who was wearing a mask on his hand, and is wearing a mask on his hands as a sign that he doesn't want to be sick."""
63,57,"It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of the virus.It's funny to read the ""I can't believe a guy who has a mask in the US has it. CDC wants to save our lives. I have an old virus and I haven't read the ""cannot believe"" part yet. This is not a joke. Because it is an illegal thing to use your personal ID for a personal purpose. It's a joke."
63,60,What exactly is a joke?
65,63,"I know, right? It would be funny if they took the vaccine but not the meds. I doubt that they did anything wrong."
76,63,I'm not sure about what the CDC is trying to make up. It's like saying the government is trying to do something that isn't a joke. It's like saying the health system is supposed to be in place to fight the government if it's not to be done.
77,63,I think I'm the only person who thinks a mask is funny.
78,63,"It sounds like the government is simply doing the right thing. The entire point of the ACA is to protect Americans from the threat of life-threatening illnesses. Its not a joke. Its just a joke. ""The real problem is that there aren't enough people in the country who actually have to wear a mask. Its not the same thing as the ACA."
99,63,"I don't know if the CDC is blaming women for wearing the masks, though, but there's a lot of skepticism about it and the government is being an anti-vaccine group."
63,1,Is there a way they're using a troll comment instead of a joke? The joke is trying to make people think they're being funny.
63,3,"Vaccines are a joke. They don't actually fight against it. The only thing that has ever been done has been to make it worse, and the CDC's response was absolutely horrifying."
63,8,"I don't know if the CDC is telling the whole truth, but I can't believe they are telling a lie."
63,10,"The article is being sarcastic. This is what I do when I am sick: ""The CDC is trying to combat the spread of HIV/AIDS through people, not masks."" The article also tries to make fun of women wearing masks, to try and make them feel better. They are trying to stop the spread of AIDS. The CDC is trying to stop the spread of HIV, which is not a joke. It's funny to read the ""I don't think the CDC is being sarcastic here."
63,14,"I don't have much insight in public health and the fact that this is a joke. I don't have any experience with the CDC. I just think it's pretty funny, and it sounds like it can really help prevent a virus."
63,17,"Yes, the CDC deems it 'unhealthy' to use a mask to keep people alive, even if it makes them feel better. The people being infected will not make them sick, they're just going to be getting sick.'"
63,22,It's one of the reasons I don't think it matters.
63,23,... i just listened to the guy who wore a mask on a friend's birthday that night
63,30,"It's not a joke. The CDC is claiming that the CDC is trying to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS through people. It's a joke, and it's just a joke."
63,34,"The CDC is not a joke. They are trying to prevent the spread of AIDS through people, not masks. They're attempting to stop it through people, not masks."
63,37,That was the worst thing I've ever heard...
63,39,>I'm a medical professional. I've had a little idea how I would feel if I knew a person who had HIV
63,40,I would be a lot more worried if my wife and I were wearing the masks and if they were going to go to the doctor.
63,43,The CDC is erecting masks around all public buildings for people who want to wear them. They are attempting to combat the spread of HIV through people. They aren't trying to stop the spread of HIV. They are trying to prevent it. They are trying to stop it.
63,47,I think you've got a point. I don't think it's funny if it's on your hand. I just thought it was a little funny and if it isn't I think it's a joke.
63,50,>(http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit_reports/r/reddit_reports/r/reddit/comments/report/Report_File/report_file_2004_2005_Report_File)
63,51,I was the one who actually jumped into the joke about a male being able to wear a mask and not a male. The fact that it would be funny to get the CDC's attention is quite pathetic.
63,56,"I can tell you from experience that the one part of this is really funny, but that part of it is just a joke. You are a jerk. It seems like the CDC is trying to cut down on the use of the term ""mask""."
63,57,"The CDC is trying to convince people that wearing a mask is not a joke, and that their approach is wrong."
63,60,">It's funny to read the ""How do you know if a man who is taking a virus has a mask on his hand, and is wearing a mask on his hands as a sign that he doesn't want to be sick."""
65,63,"I don't even know how that makes sense. The joke isn't a joke, it's just a joke. Trying to do that in your current position would be silly."
76,63,"Vaccination is the only way to stop a disease - it's the only way to get a good one. But, the US government doesn't have the ability to make any effort to stop the spread of that disease."
77,63,"[Language in this subreddit: i read that this was a joke by a guy that i lived with in dc and he said his parents were sick and that he had to attend school because he thought they had a terrible cough', 'This is not how the federal government is supposed to deal with this.',"
78,63,The issue is not the actual threat. Its the threat of the whole system. Its a joke.
99,63,It's the world is a joke about people with HIV. Vaccination is a joke. The world is a joke about people with HIV. Vaccination is a joke.
63,1,As a medical professional I can say this is one of my favorite jokes and all. But you're not gonna be able to change.
63,3,"Vaccination is the best method for dealing with the health problem without taking the government's advice or guidance in a manner that could potentially cause a major death. In many countries people are not being vaccinated at all, or having the vaccine on their hand doesn't make things worse. There is no legal implication on that as the best way to deal with it, and it's a joke."
63,8,"There is a good deal of talk about it on the internet, but I think there is a lot more to the story. If you are able to get a quote from the article and the source is in r/media, it is a bit hard to get that to be a good one."
63,10,"You're getting a'slap on the wrist' vibe from this comment. You should read it carefully and re-read it and re-read it in a slightly different way. You seem to be a bit over-sensitive to the post title, especially the headline."
63,14,"Vaccination isn't a joke, it's an affront to a common sense sense. You can tell from the title, it's a joke. You're going to have a joke. I'm not sure you've got the answers you want, but I think it's a joke. You need to stand up for yourself."
63,17,I think the way it was portrayed wasn't funny.
63,22,"I am a medical professional. I can tell you from experience that the one part of this is really funny, but that part of it is just a joke. The fact that it would be funny to get the CDC's attention is quite pathetic."
63,23,I believe the people who voted for a CDC president or president should have heard that the CDC should have taken the time to write a letter to the president.
63,30,The joke isn't funny. It's just a joke.
63,34,It is a joke. It is not a joke. It is a joke. It is a joke. It is a joke. It is a joke.
63,37,If you were to have a question and you thought you had an interesting answer then don't say anything. You are merely pointing out that you don't have a point and you aren't a doctor.
63,39,Its a joke. Its a joke.
63,40,I'm not sure how you explain why people can't wear a mask. It isn't a joke. I'm more than sure it's a joke and a joke.
63,43,You know what's funny?
63,47,"Vaccination is not an ""anything's good"", just a way to get rid of the germ. You are not a jerk for a joke. It is the only way to prevent it. Vaccination is not a joke."
63,50,"It's also a joke. Whether or not this has actually been said, ""This isn't the best or the most effective way to stop the spread of the virus,"" or ""Always get out of there"" he's probably using a joke."
63,51,"In a way, the CDC is trying to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS, which is a very dangerous disease, but not for health reasons that would stop the spread of HIV/AIDS."
63,56,"The joke isn't funny, it's a joke. You're a jerk."
63,57,"I've been reading the CDC's ""The issue is not the actual threat. It's the threat of the whole system. The world is a joke about people with HIV."
63,60,I think the whole point of being a joke is that it makes people uncomfortable.
65,63,"This is a good joke, but I guess you shouldn't be able to make it out to someone who can't get the vaccine."
76,63,I'd read the article and I'd be impressed by the humor!
77,63,"Those are some of the best jokes I've seen here in the past - ""I don't see why they would even be so much of a problem."""
78,63,"CANNOTANSWER: ""The only thing I don't understand is the fact that the government is trying to make them wear a mask in public, and they are not allowed to do so is really telling."""
99,63,"I'm not saying the government is good, I'm saying it's a good idea. I'm just saying that the government is working on a way to prevent HIV infection and the vaccine is a joke."
63,1,I am trying to tell you that the idea of wearing a mask to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS is so pathetic that it makes it impossible to see it.
63,3,"I've never heard the phrase ""Face mask on the face"" before in my life, but I am pretty sure I could find that one."
63,8,Vaccines aren't a joke. It's a joke.
63,10,It seems like a lot of the commenters are not as sensitive to women as other commenters are to the mask.
63,14,I don't know why he says that.
63,17,It's a joke. Vaccination is a joke.
63,22,"So, what does the US do to help with HIV/AIDS?"
63,23,"I've heard this joke before, and I'm just not sure how the people who voted for the President were made to agree with it."
63,30,"I didn't realize this was a joke, I saw a lot of people with HIV on the news and was not happy with it. I was not surprised that there were a lot of people in the news who aren't sick."
63,34,"""You're not a doctor, you're just asking for a sign that they know what it is and they're not putting it on their hands."""
63,37,"""The fact that Maroon is wearing his mask does not mean that they are using it. Then wear it like a full face mask and it works wonders when you're dressed and don't have your hands wrapped around you."""
63,39,CANNOTANSWER:
63,40,"""If you were to have a question and you thought you had an interesting answer then don't say anything."""
63,43,I'm not saying it's a joke. I'm saying it's a joke.
63,47,The word is a joke. There is nothing funny about it. The only way to stop it is if it is in their hands.
63,50,"This sounds like the kind of thing you can get away with. Besides, there's nothing funny about this troll, he's just trying to make it seem that his premise is fucked up and is a joke."
63,51,I would be willing to bet that a doctor will come into school and start laughing about the issue.
63,56,"The CDC is not trying to cut down on the use of the term ""mask"". They're essentially trying to make the people in the school that work in a sick school wear a mask."
63,57,Vaccination is the only way to stop the spread of a virus.
63,60,"CANNOTANSWER: ""The only thing I don't understand is the fact that the government is trying to make them wear a mask in public, and they are not allowed to do so is really telling."""
65,63,It’s not about what to do with people who don’t want to get a vaccine.
76,63,"""This is an interesting post on the internet. I've seen it on r/ntxpanda many times and it's pretty funny that this person talks about the NRA and the CDC."
77,63,A joke is a joke because it's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
78,63,I'm a big fan of the ACA.
99,63,"Vaccination is the same as not being vaccinated without proper training. But yes, some people have a problem with it, but it's not the joke. People are using it to smear the government and they have no real reason to believe that it's actually a good idea."
63,1,What the fuck? What does the president have to say about the lack of vaccine?
63,3,"The only way to prevent someone from getting it is to be vaccinated. You just need to take the word out and try and see what the CDC genuinely wants. This is not about being a troll, it is about helping people. I think this is about a troll trying to get a good answer."
63,8,Vaccination isn't a joke. It is actually a joke. It is a joke. It is not good for preventing the spread of a virus. It's a joke.
63,10,"I’ve been in school for 6 years and my mother made fun of her. I’ve been in school for a few years, I think."
63,14,"""The first thing you hear about the virus is not going to be the first thing you hear about."""
63,17,"""I don't think a joke is a joke. The CDC should not have taken a back seat to stopping HIV/AIDS. I think they are not doing anything about it. It's just not funny."""
63,22,I'd say a lot of the people who voted for the President were made to agree with it.
63,23,I think the joke is just the joke.
63,30,"I'm not sure I believe the government is going to give us a fuck about a mask or something that's not true or something. The whole ACA thing is a joke. I mean, the CDC is supposedly trying to stop the spread of a virus, it's not a joke, it's just a joke."
63,34,There are two kinds of masks for people.
63,37,"Vaccination is a joke, it's not about what to do with people who don't want to get a vaccine."
63,39,Is it a joke?
63,40,> It sounds like the government and the health care industry are all just as bad as you'd think. It isn't a joke.
63,43,The joke makes it sound like people want to stop the spread of HIV and that they want to stop the spread of the virus
63,47,What are the terms used to mean?
63,50,It's a joke.
63,51,"[Not just an anti-viral joke, it's an anti-semitic joke."
63,56,"I think the most important thing is to be a good person, not a troll."
63,57,"The CDC is trying to convince people that wearing a mask is not a joke, and that their approach is wrong."
63,60,"""I think the whole point of being a joke is that it makes people uncomfortable.... Then wear it like a full face mask and it works wonders when you're dressed and don't have your hands wrapped around you."""
65,63,There's no real difference between making people wear a mask and making people get sick. There's no difference between getting sick and being sick.
76,63,The NRA was also very controversial. The CDC has a responsibility to ensure that the people who are at risk get vaccinated.
77,63,">I don't get the full story but I've seen it. It was just that I was a teacher who had been wearing a mask at school, and the fact that she had no access to a public health facility that wasn't a normal thing to say."""
78,63,In what way does this make it better for the people who want to protect them?
99,63,"Yes, it's a joke. It's a joke. Vaccination is the same as not being vaccinated without proper training. And yes, some people have a problem with it, but it's not the joke. People are using it to smear the government and they have no real reason to believe that it's actually a good idea."
63,1,I'm not sure why the CDC is trying to cut them off. I think the joke is just a joke.
63,3,"This is a joke, i know a lot about it and they are trying to get you to believe it. I hate to say it, but I can see why people can't believe a joke is a joke. Its a rebuttal to the fact that the CDC has no mandate to prevent people from getting HIV/AIDS."
63,8,The guy is a troll.
63,10,"It sounds like this is about a troll. People are not attracted to the joke, and a lot of the commenters are not as sensitive to the article."
63,14,Is this a joke? You are referring to a joke about not being vaccinated. Is it a joke about not being vaccinated?
63,17,"I'm an empathetic child who thinks that the government is doing their job, to prevent the spread of AIDS, is a bit harsh to a student and not a good one."
63,22,In the future it would be very difficult for the public to become a bit of a doctor and to even have a symptom. A simple mask in a neoprosthetic will be enough for a lot of people and can essentially put on a permanent mask. The real thing is that you could be working in the CDC or in a clinic because if they get sick they can't even do anything about it.
63,23,"I don't think you understand why a joke is considered a joke. There's a joke in the sense that if you wear a mask, it helps you feel better."
63,30,"That's not a joke if you're putting people in quarantines, but a joke if people just stop going to the doctor, so they get sick if they don't."
63,34,Vaccination is not a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.
63,37,There's no'mood joke' in this post. The CDC is trying to convince people that wearing a mask is a joke. The government is trying to make a joke about it. The CDC should not have taken a back seat to stopping the spread of a virus. I think they are not doing anything about it. It's just not funny.
63,39,"I'd call the CDC's approach ""a joke."""
63,40,There's no way to make a joke out of a joke because it's not going to get you sick.
63,43,Is a mask part of the measures deployed by the government?
63,47,"If a person vaccinates them, then that's a joke. They have to know this is a joke and are not going to make any money off of it."
63,50,That's a pretty big joke. It's just a joke.
63,51,Vaccination is a joke. There is nothing wrong with using it as an excuse to have a fever.
63,56,"Is it really a joke? It's a joke if it isn't, right? Those are all just examples of fake news that can get out of hand. The problem is that most people on reddit do not even get a joke like this."
63,57,>We got a floppy mask on my mom
63,60,The CDC should have taken a back seat to stopping the spread of a virus. I think they are not doing anything about it. It's just not funny.
65,63,"Wearing a mask prevents the spread of a virus. It's an excellent joke, it's not just a joke. It's a joke. I don't like the idea of being a jerk, I don't want to be a sarcastic asshole."
76,63,"Yes, it's a serious problem, but a CDC, and even the Obama Administration, are working to prevent a large number of people from getting the vaccine, as opposed to the government. Regardless of how much work they're taking, it's pretty much a joke."
77,63,"Thats kind of what I am saying. ""Dear, I just want to say I'm happy this is a joke."
78,63,The government will do what is best. The way the joke is coming off is sarcastic.
99,63,"You mean ""not a joke?"" That's kind of a joke to me."
63,1,I think the CDC is just trying to get people to stop going to the doctor. It's an excellent joke.
63,3,"It's a joke, it's a joke. It's a joke. Vaccines are a joke. A joke is a joke if you get sick."
63,8,"Vaccines are a joke, and the fact that there's nothing in the article that says it is a joke is a joke."
63,10,The article was published at a time when it was going on the front page as if there was a joke that the government was trying to stop the spread of AIDS by putting people in quarantines.
63,14,I read the title in a journal and can't find a joke but I'm sure some people get it.
63,17,"I don't think the CDC is doing their job, to prevent the spread of a virus."
63,22,People say that they're trying to convince people that a mask prevents the spread of HIV/AIDS.
63,23,So we're talking about an epidemic.
63,30,"You can do it when you're sick because of it. You can't make it by putting a mask on your hands, and it's just a joke. But I can tell you from experience that the vaccine has had a lot of bad experiences, and that they don't expect you to do it anymore."
63,34,I think the main point of the article is to point out that wearing a mask doesn't help with the spread of a virus. It's a joke because it reflects on the government's willingness to go down that path.
63,37,"> I'm an empathetic child who thinks that the government is doing their job, to prevent the spread of AIDS, is a bit harsh to a student and not a good one."
63,39,I'm not an asshole. I don't even know why this is a joke.
63,40,"Because the fact that this article has a lot of headlines proving to be true (and is inaccurate), and the fact that there are more headlines, it can only be construed as an explanation for the situation."
63,43,Vaccination is a joke. Its not just a joke.
63,47,Vaccination doesn't get rid of the virus.
63,50,... It sounds like a joke.
63,51,"People are misunderstanding that, as a doctor who got a sick patient with HIV, it is a joke. It is an actual joke."
63,56,What kind of mask is wearing at the school to stop a virus from spread?
63,57,"I want to point out that the people who are interested in identifying with HIV is an empathetic kid who thinks that the government is doing their job, to prevent the spread of AIDS, are essentially just children in school. That's part of the fun, part of the fun of this."
63,60,I don't think that's a joke. I think that people are just being a little selfish.
65,63,>Asking for some masks doesn't give you the right to prevent them from coming out and I am going to have to buy them for a different reason. I don't think it's that bad a joke isn't it?
76,63,Vaccination is necessary for everyone. But it is a joke.
77,63,It's very sad that this is a joke if it has nothing to do with the government. The premise of a mask is intended to prevent a virus that may not be spread all the time and isn't even very helpful.
78,63,This is a joke. I don't care how stupid and sarcastic or narcissistic it is. The ACA is a joke. 'The government is just skunks. The entire point of the ACA is to prevent people from getting sick.
99,63,Vaccination is a joke. It's illegal.
63,1,If the CDC had tried this as a joke they would have cut the CDC off as well.
63,3,This is a joke. It's a joke.
63,8,I'm the one who found the article blatantly inaccurate.
63,10,It is not the joke. The joke is a joke.
63,14,It is an obvious joke that it is an affront to common sense.
63,17,"Vaccination is a joke, as in the government is doing their job, to prevent the spread of a virus."
63,22,"I'm a student at a university, and I've read a number of articles that are misleading and incorrect about this whole problem. A teacher is very rude and I don't understand that."
63,23,I think I should be more clear about the topic and not just the people in the article.
63,30,"So, why do people call this a joke?"
63,34,"They can't really stop that kind of thing at the school, and they can't even start a public health department. Vaccination is a joke, because it's meant to stop people from getting sick."
63,37,They are not doing anything about it. They are trying to stop it.
63,39,">An empathetic kid who thinks that the government is doing their job, to prevent the spread of a virus."
63,40,I don't think you have the right to be sick from HIV/ AIDS.
63,43,This is a joke. The government is just skunks. The whole point of the ACA is to stop people from getting sick. Vaccination is a joke.
63,47,I don't think you are being funny. I'm not arguing that it's a joke. I'm trying to convince you that the ACA isn't a joke because it says that people need to learn to protect their children. Vaccination is just a joke. You don't even have to be a joke to be a joke.
63,50,I'm in the nth grade.
63,51,A man can do that and he is going to be fine. A doctor needs to be okay with this joke.
63,56,CDC does not support a government mandate for the mask to prevent AIDS spreading. You can't even make it a joke if you have HIV.
63,57,"So you're asking if you're being funny? I'm gonna chuckle if you were, but it's a joke."
63,60,People who are able to recognize how sick someone is with a virus and are using them for a purpose is a joke.
65,63,"It's an excellent joke, but it's just a joke. I don't like the idea of being a jerk, I don't think anybody in the public health system is being able to give you the benefit of the doubt."
76,63,A joke. A joke. A joke. A joke. A joke. A joke. A joke. A joke.
77,63,"I do not want to be an authority figure in the government, but I think that is a joke that has nothing to do with the government. A mask does nothing to help prevent spreading a virus. It just prevents people from getting sick or sick."
78,63,It's not a joke. The government is just skunks.
99,63,"The joke is a joke, not a joke."
63,1,"I don't even know if this is a joke, but I've heard the whole CDC thing before. Aside from being a joke, it's just a joke."
63,3,"The truth is, the world is the most complicated and often messed up world."
63,8,The article is misleading and I cannot accept that. I'm asking because the CDC is giving it a second chance and doesn't even look like the CDC is trying to change it.
63,10,"If you are sick and you can't make fun of someone else, don't wear the mask. And you are not being funny."
63,14,> I think I should be more clear about the topic and not just the people in the article.
63,17,"If you're gonna be a doctor, you need to get out. This is the whole point of the ACA."
63,22,Vaccination is meant to help stop the spread of HIV/AIDS.
63,23,"I'm not an authority figure, but I'm trying to convince you that it's a joke."
63,30,"Vaccination is a joke. They don't actually have to do anything about it, but it's a troll joke. It's the kind of joke that people should not have to use."
63,34,"...and they're not doing anything for him because of the mask, and he doesn't need the mask, so they're not trying to stop him from getting sick. He didn't even want to say he's sick, and he wanted to stop him from getting sick. It's not a joke."
63,37,"You're assuming that, in a lot of ways, the government is a joke and the government is trying to stop the spread of AIDS."
63,39,I think a joke is funny because it is aimed at people who think the government is trying to stop the spread of a virus.
63,40,"People can't really know what the issue is at all if they don't go to a doctor. A doctor doesn't have a duty to know, if they're concerned, if they're concerned. It's one thing to wear a mask because it's so common a health issue but a public health issue."
63,43,Vaccination is not a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.
63,47,People are not being skunks. I don't think it's funny because I think it's a joke.
63,50,"So what is a joke? I mean, the joke is a joke. It is a joke, it is a joke."
63,51,"Vaccination is a joke a lot of teachers do not understand. They want the public to understand and help spread the disease, and as such, they don't see it as a joke."
63,56,>A man who is taking a virus has a mask on his hand that works wonders when he's walked on his back.
63,57,It’s a joke.
63,60,Vaccination is a joke.
65,63,"If you're not being serious, there's a huge difference between a joke and a good joke."
76,63,The people who put the mask on are just joking around. The government doesn't want the people to have a go. They want the government to go ahead. They want the government to take care of the people and not protect the people.
77,63,'I feel like they’re trying to make the jokes that people are so out of touch with are just a lot more revealing.
78,63,"""Wearing a mask helps in stopping the spread of a virus."
99,63,"That’s a really, really bad joke, but the idea of using the word'silly' to smear the government is one of the most stupid and stupid things you’ve ever heard."
63,1,"You know, I'm a doctor, so I don't know a lot about you."
63,3,"What's a joke? I'm actually not trying to convince you that that's a joke, but that's exactly why the article is so ridiculous: The fact that Maroon is wearing his mask doesn't mean that they are using it."
63,8,I’ve never seen a joke in that oppressed nature.
63,10,"""The government is trying to combat the spread of AIDS through people, not masks."""
63,14,Vaccination is a joke and isn’t a joke. The government is trying to make people understand and protect the people. It’s just the gov’t smearing the gov’t and not the public
63,17,"Vaccination isn't a joke. It's a joke, a joke, a joke."
63,22,"I don’t know how I think people can get to a CDC interview when they’re working with doctors, they just can’t seem to think it’s a joke and I don’t get it."
63,23,"I'm not sure what else is relevant, unless I understand why a joke is considered a joke."
63,30,That's an awesome idea. I don't think it would be fair to wear a mask while sick because if it is a joke.
63,34,"Vaccination is intended to stop people getting sick. This is a joke. The joke that the CDC is trying to prevent is a troll joke. They're trying to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS through people, not masks."
63,37,"""""A guy who is taking a virus has a mask on his hand that works wonders when he's walked on his back. It’s a joke. Vaccination is a joke."
63,39,The people that use it are the one who get sick. I don't know how it's actually a joke.
63,40,It's one thing to wear a mask because it's so common a health issue but a public health issue.
63,43,So if this isn't the best stance of all time then I'm gonna say it's a joke?
63,47,"I was in a position where the joke was more about a joke than it is about a joke, so maybe I can explain it more. Vaccination is a joke because it's a joke."
63,50,This guy is trying to make you think it is a joke.
63,51,Vaccination is a joke. It's a joke. It is a joke. Vaccination is a joke.
63,56,"No, he's right. I think the CDC should be in charge of the prevention of the spread of HIV/Aids. The reason that he's wearing a mask on his hands is because he knows he's sick and he knows he has to go to a doctor. I think people with HIV/Aids are also going to get a bit bit sick because their kids do not have a mask on their hands."
63,57,People who wear a mask are being sarcastic and not funny.
63,60,Vaccination is not a joke.
65,63,There is a huge difference between making people wear a mask and not doing it. You can't say it's a joke and you can't say that you like it. There is no joke.
76,63,I'm a medical doctor and am a doctor with a lot of friends who have this virus and the same doctor who has a sneezed rat.
77,63,"Is it possible that a teacher of mine may not want to be an authority figure in the government, but is going to be a joke about the government? Clearly, I don't want to be a dick about this."
78,63,"It's a joke if you like it a lot, but there's nothing a joke doesn't mean."
99,63,"I haven't even had a conversation with you on that one, but there were comments here about the fact that you were surprised how many people who were unaware of the CDC jokes were talking about people wearing masks."
63,1,"""A guy who is taking a virus has a mask on his hand that works wonders when he's walked on his back. It’s a joke. Vaccination is a joke."
63,3,[It was a joke but I'm not sure how to put it].
63,8,They are trying to stop a virus by putting on a mask.
63,10,That's all. My point is that I don't want to know what they think of the article. That's what I've been saying. I don't know how I'd want to be informed about the article.
63,14,"The joke is a joke, it's a joke."
63,17,"It's a joke. Vaccination is a joke, it is a joke, it is a joke."
63,22,A teacher is very rude and I don’t understand that. It’s a joke. It’s a joke.
63,23,"What do you mean by ""Joke""? Is it a joke?"
63,30,I believe in the CDC they knowingly chose to use a mask.
63,34,It is a joke. It is a joke.
63,37,It's not like the joke is an actual joke. The joke is that it's a joke and the joke is about it. It's not the same as asking someone if they can stop the spread of AIDS.
63,39,"Vaccination is a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke, so I wouldn't take it as a joke. Vaccination is a joke because it's intended to stop the spread of a virus. Vaccination is not a joke, but it's a joke."
63,40,A bit of the people in this thread might not understand the CDC assassinating a joke.
63,43,"""Vaccination isn't a joke. The joke that the CDC is trying to prevent is a troll joke."""
63,47,I believe you're being a bit sarcastic because of the CDC. But the joke is a joke because it's so obvious that it doesn't actually mean anything when it comes to HIV/AIDS. It could be a joke if CDC could say it was a joke.
63,50,"I mean, I've seen an entire episode of This Post recently where a doctor has a sick child, and a teacher asks her parents if she can go to the doctor with it."
63,51,Vaccination is a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.
63,56,"My job is more about the school, and if someone doesn't have a fucking problem, they can't do it. Trying to avoid a joke is one thing, but being a troll on purpose is another. Vaccination is a joke because it prevents infections."
63,57,People have different perceptions of the vaccine.
63,60,"The CDC has made this a joke for years, so if you want to know why, try calling it a joke to get the word out there."
65,63,I think they should stop wearing the mask because it prevents the spread of the virus.
76,63,"Vaccination is the only way to stop a disease, it is the only way to get a good one. However, there's no way that vaccines are to stop the spread of a disease in other countries."
77,63,"The ""Joke"" isn't a joke. This is a joke."
78,63,"The first person speaker says that the fact that people get AIDS from wearing a mask is a serious problem, and I don't think it's a joke at all. I just think it's just a joke, and the point of the ACA is to prevent people from getting sick."
99,63,"I'm gonna call this a joke, a joke about you guys."
63,1,"This isn't a joke, it's a joke about the CDC's efforts to prevent infection. The CDC and the U.S. are trying to 'cut off the CDC', and they're trying to keep them out of the public eye."
63,3,It's actually not a joke. It's just a joke.
63,8,Vaccines are a joke. It is a joke.
63,10,"I've read a lot of this, and this is what I'm talking about."
63,14,"The joke is, by its definition, a joke."
63,17,"The point of the ACA is to prevent a disease and if people don't get the virus, they can't vaccinate them."
63,22,It is a joke. The CDC is trying to stop the spread of the virus. Is there an alternative or not? I am guessing the answer would be to have a sex with someone or not in your own country. The CDC is being a troll.
63,23,The point is that the only way to keep people from getting sick is to put it on a mask.
63,30,I'd love to have you know this!
63,34,"The article states: ""This is a joke. I think it's a joke because it's intended to stop people from getting sick."
63,37,That was the worst thing I've ever heard.
63,39,There are very few CDC guidelines. They are the rules that are used by the government to try and stop people from getting AIDS.
63,40,"I don't know why I'm being insensitive. I'm being a bit sarcastic. I want to rant about what the CDC is trying to achieve in this thread, but I'm not sure. I don't care."
63,43,Vaccination is a joke. The CDC erects masks around all public buildings for people who want to wear them. They are attempting to combat the spread of HIV through people. They are attempting to prevent the spread of HIV through people. They are attempting to prevent the spread of a virus.
63,47,"Vaccination isn't a joke, it's a joke."
63,50,Is this a joke? No?
63,51,You don't understand the joke?
63,56,Why would the CDC put masks on everyone?
63,57,"It’s really funny. I gotta say I’m an avid AIDS victim. It makes me feel like I’m the joker. I just hate the word ""joke."" It’s ridiculous, and it’s not funny."
63,60,It's a joke because he makes a joke about the disease. You are wrong. He is a troll. The joke isn't a joke.
65,63,"There is a big difference between wearing a mask to prevent the spread of a virus, and not getting sick. The point is that the mask is ineffective."
76,63,It's a joke because the government hasn't been able to do anything to stop it.
77,63,"I don't know how this would be a good joke but I'd be happy to make it on a page where I can't be an authority figure in a government, but I think this is a joke."
78,63,"The ACA is a joke, but it's a joke, just like the ACA."
99,63,I have an attorney who does not understand a joke and has a lawyer that is a doctor.
63,1,"""I can't even see it,"""
63,3,Vaccines are a joke. Its a joke because they're meant to fight the HIV epidemic. And they are not a joke.
63,8,I just wanted to tell you something.
63,10,Is this the one that I'm gonna talk about.
63,14,So how are you in the US?
63,17,"Vaccination is a joke, and it's not a joke, because a joke that's actually a joke and isn't a joke is not a joke. Vaccination is a joke because the CDC is trying to stop the spread of a virus."
63,22,"> The point of the ACA is to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. The point of the ACA is to prevent a disease and if people don't get the virus, they can't vaccinate them. It is a joke. The CDC erects masks around all public buildings for people who want to wear them."
63,23,"I don't know if this is a joke or not, but I'd suggest a doctor make a post explaining the difference between wearing a mask and not getting sick. That way, you don't have to explain the difference between the two."
63,30,"They're not trying to stop the spread of the virus, they're trying to stop the spread of HIV through people. It's just a joke."
63,34,"I'm an anti-viral doctor, so I don't really know how the joke isn't funny."
63,37,"Is wearing a mask to stop people from getting sick, or to prevent the spread of the virus. It’s a joke because the government hasn’t been able to do anything to stop it. It’s a joke because the government hasn’t been able to stop the spread of the virus. The CDC is trying to stop the spread of a virus. It’s a joke because the government hasn’t been able to stop the spread of the virus. It’s a joke because the CDC has no shit on the problem here."
63,39,"You could also say, ""We all are on this earth, it doesn't matter if you are on this earth unless you are alive and you don't like it."""
63,40,> I don't think you have the right to be sick from HIV/AIDS.
63,43,"I think it’s funny and funny. If this is a joke, I’ll take it."
63,47,It's funny. But I thought it was funny.
63,50,I've got a lot of people that have never had this happened but I don't get it.
63,51,"This is the CDC trying to prevent. You should never say that you don't understand the joke, or you should never mention it."
63,56,It makes me feel like I'm the joker.
63,57,"I was trying to make fun of a troll for wearing a floppy mask at my school, and was very insensitive."
63,60,A lot of this is a joke.
65,63,Having a 'joke' and a joke in the same sentence are two entirely different things.
76,63,"Vaccination is a joke because of the fact that it has to be done for a good reason, as the government has been doing so for years. This is a joke because the government is trying to stop that, but it's a joke because it's been used for good reasons."
77,63,"I've been on a hat joke several times. I can't really say I'd want a hat joke, but I'm not going to play that hat joke."
78,63,It was just an idea. It was just a joke. It wasn't a law.
99,63,>It's the world is a joke about people with HIV. Vaccination is a joke. It is an important part of protecting children and the public from a deadly virus.
63,1,This isn't a joke. The CDC has a lot of time and resources on this topic.
63,3,The CDC has no mandate to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS. They've been doing nothing about it. The people in the article aren't even saying that this is a joke.
63,8,A troll is an idiot. It's a shitstorm of people that know the truth about the joke. The CDC is trying to prevent the spread of a virus by putting on a mask. The CDC is trying to prevent the spread of a virus. The joke is being made by a troll.
63,10,">I am a bit sick of the CDC making the people a troll. They do not seem to understand the issue. It seems like a lot of the commenters are not as sensitive to women as other commenters are to the mask.', ""He said his eyes had a virus on them...', ""I am not a medical doctor, but i see this as a problem for a lot of people. The government is a private body with no mandate. The issue is with those who a joke."
63,14,Vaccination is an important part of the public health and protecting people from the spread of a virus.
63,17,It's a joke because it's a joke and a joke for a reason.
63,22,Vaccination is an important part of protecting children and the public from a deadly virus.
63,23,"No way. The joke isn't really that funny, it's that people are trying to hide it so that the public doesn't think it's funny. It's a joke because it's not just a joke."
63,30,You have no idea what a troll joke is.
63,34,"The article says that the CDC is trying to prevent the spread of AIDS through people, not masks. It's a joke."
63,37,They are doing something to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS. It’s a joke because they don’t want to be infected. AIDS is one of the few diseases that Americans can get without going to a doctor. It’s a joke because the CDC is trying to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS.
63,39,It's a joke because the government isn't doing their job.
63,40,I'm sure that the CDC has something to offer.
63,43,"It's a joke and a joke, not a joke."
63,47,Vaccination isn't a joke because it's an obvious issue that the government's not going to do something about.

63,57,This is a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.
63,60,It's a joke because he makes a joke about the disease.
65,63,This guy has written in an excellent piece about how the government is making it illegal because it makes people sick and not helping others.
76,63,Vaccination is a joke because it has a good reason. A joke because it has a good reason.
77,63,Thats a pretty fucking funny joke. You should not be allowed to go to a public school for a viral illness. That's a joke.
78,63,It is a joke. The ACA is a joke. But it's not a joke. It's a joke.
99,63,The CDC is pushing it.
63,1,It doesn't actually make sense.
63,3,The whole article is based on a lot of the people in the article who were in the lab with him. I would also add that he's trying to get people to put on a mask.
63,8,"There is an AMA on the Internet about a vaccine being put on a mask, that can prevent a virus and spread without anyone noticing a difference in severity. Vaccines are very effective for preventing the spread of a virus."
63,10,"I think the most important issue to look for here is the title, which is not about a joke."
63,14,"The CDC is a joke, and they're trying to stop the spread of AIDS - if you don't know what it's called - but I think the government is a troll."
63,17,I can't believe the government has said this. Vaccination is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
63,22,"I was in the hospital and I went from having a cough to not getting sick, and my GI symptoms were more or less comparable to what my CDC told me. This joke is hilarious."
63,23,The government is not doing anything to stop the spread of the virus. It's a joke because people are unable to get vaccines.
63,30,"I don't know about the ACA, but the CDC is trying to protect the public from the AIDS virus. The CDC is pushing to stop the spread. They are trying to prevent it and they are not doing anything about it."
63,34,"In some ways, it's a joke, in other ways it's a joke that's about an issue that is not going to be addressed in the ACA."
63,37,The article states that the CDC is trying to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS. It’s a joke because it has a good reason. It’s a joke because it has a good reason.
63,39,"I think the CDC just wanted to make people feel better that the government was making a joke about the problem, and not the facts. Vaccination is a joke to prevent people getting AIDS. But it's a joke because the government isn't doing their job."
63,40,"You gotta keep a mouth shut, you gotta put the masks back in the back of your neck."
63,43,CDC: it's a joke because it's a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke because it has a good reason.
63,47,"There are still plenty of ways to do it. Having an vaccinated child is a good idea. It doesn't seem like it's something the government will do. But the fact is, if you're actually in a position to make the point, the CDC isn't really making a point about the issue. If you're not aware of how the ACA is doing things, the CDC isn't doing anything about it."
63,50,You can’t possibly do it as a joke. You can’t just do it in a public place. They can’t even say something about it. You have no idea what a joke is.
63,51,Vaccination is a joke because it's a joke for a reason.
63,56,"I'm in my 40's and I work in a private health clinic & a psych clinic and my teacher tells me I wear a mask to get sick and that the person who is sick has no clue what I'm wearing, and if I do, they don't use it. I'm not wearing a mask."
63,57,"I can't imagine a doctor ever thinking about wearing a mask at a school that wasn't very familiar with the virus because he had an infected mom (or any other family member) and there's been a bunch of uninformed kids, as opposed to people who would have had a mask on themselves."
63,60,"""It's a joke because he makes a joke about the disease. I think that people are just being a little selfish."""
65,63,"This a bunch of jokes in general are all just jokes that are just jokes. This is where we get that stuff and I'm not sure if you're using a general joke, just a joke. I'm very sorry to hear that."
76,63,"You're a funny doctor? Not a doctor, but a joke?"
77,63,I'm surprised that someone thinks it's a joke.
78,63,CANNOTANSWER is an anti-obama nut who likes to complain to the government about the ACA and is referring to the lack of the ACA. Its just an attempt to stop the spread of a virus.
99,63,The joke about the mask is also the joke about the health care system.
63,1,This whole thing is making me wonder how a CDC official might understand that he is talking about the AIDS vaccine.
63,3,"It's a joke because it's a joke. They are making a joke. That's what's going on. It's a joke to have a funny joke, but it's still a joke."
63,8,"No, he's not a joke. The government is acting like a joke."
63,10,"I've read a lot of the comments I've read about it, and I can't even remember how to properly say it without making fun of people."
63,14,Vaccination is a joke because of a joke that makes them more likely to get sick. It also means that it can prevent the spread of other diseases like HIV/AIDS if they can't stop it.
63,17,"It's very hard to say that Obama is anti-vaccine, or that Obama doesn't want to end the fight over the ACA and that it will not make sense for him to do so. Is it worth the risk of the ACA?"
63,22,"It sounds like some pretty ignorant person in the US doesn't know what the ACA is, so he's probably not quite aware. I'm just saying. It's not a joke. It's a joke because the CDC wants to stop it."
63,23,This is about the CDC and the Obama administration.
63,30,I'm sure a lot of CDC-connected people are ok with this.
63,34,"He's a doctor, isn't he?"
63,37,This is a post that has been posted for over three weeks and we're all gonna have to resubmit a little bit more if we don't want to continue the nonsense. We have a long way to go to this.
63,39,Vaccination is a joke because it's intended to prevent the spread of the disease.
63,40,"No, no. No, no, no. It’s a joke. Rather than a joke."
63,43,There is no such thing as a joke. Just a bad joke.
63,47,"I don't have a problem with vaccinating my kid, and have no problem with getting my kid vaccinated."
63,50,"It doesn't sound like they were trying to stop the spread of AIDS. They're talking about the fact that a man who's been in the hospital with an AIDS infection has an unproven infection. A man who tries to kill other people who get HIV/AIDS is in fact a racist who thinks his BS is true, which is a bit of a stretch."
63,51,It's a joke for people to have it.
63,56,"No, not a joke. Just a joke. You just said that."
63,57,>I just hate the word joke.
63,60,"A lot of these cdc jokes are very true, but not for the general general ones like 'People who are able to recognize how sick someone is with a virus and are using them for a purpose is a joke.'"
65,63,He's not a jerk and he shouldn't be forced to do that in his current position.
76,63,Vaccination is a joke. It's not a joke because it's a joke.
77,63,"I don't get why a mask would be a joke. Whether or not that's a joke, the issue lies with the government."
78,63,The joke is a joke. It's a joke. The government has no obligation to protect people or prevent illnesses in the first place. It is just a joke.
99,63,"Yes, I'm going to go ahead and give the quote, I'm just saying that the CDC is pushing it."
63,1,"Yes, we can't have a CDC official stop the conversation, and he is not a troll. The president is a troll because he is an anti-vaccine shill, so he is being very clear about the facts and he is making the point that if someone gets infected he is a troll, not a troll. He is a joke."
63,3,What's a joke? That's a joke.
63,8,There's a lot more than just a joke. The CDC is trying to keep people in the system.
63,10,There was a really bad story about the article that went up about the people vaccinating their kids and got them in quarantine.
63,14,I don't know why people are ignoring the joke. It's not a joke that the CDC is pushing the ACA.
63,17,"""This is a joke that's getting more and more attention."""
63,22,The point of the ACA is to help stop the spread of a disease.
63,23,The joke is the one that's not the joke. The one that's the joke that's the joke.
63,30,You're being insulted by a CDC article.
63,34,It's a joke.
63,37,It’s a joke because the government is trying to stop the spread of the virus.
63,39,He's being sarcastic because he is a doctor and is referring to a joke aimed at people who think the government is trying to stop the spread of the virus.
63,40,I know the CDC is trying to stop the spread of AIDS and there is actually a lot of things happening that need to be addressed. There is a joke of 'But a mask does not prevent the spread of AIDS'. This is a joke. This is a joke.
63,43,Vaccination is not a joke. The joke is a joke because it has a good reason. They are attempting to prevent the spread of HIV through people. They are trying to prevent the spread of HIV through people. They are attempting to prevent the spread of HIV through people. They are trying to prevent it through people.
63,47,This is what happens to me when someone is in a situation where I have no problem with them being in a bad situation. I have not tried. If I do I will continue to think that the ACA is better for preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS. I am trying to convince them to stop the ACA.

63,37,CANNOTANSWER has been complaining to the CDC about the ACA -
63,39,Vaccination is a joke because it's intended to stop the spread of the disease. It’s a joke because it's intended to stop the spread of the disease.
63,40,"I think they're being very conservative, but you're right that that's not a good joke."
63,43,"I'm a big HIV fan and I don't think it's a joke. It's just that the CDC doesn't use the word ""cowardly"" in their policies. This doesn't sound like a joke."
63,47,I'm a parent.
63,50,You think I'm a troll? No. It's not a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke.
63,51,"It is a joke because it is about the government, and the government wants to have the government go all the way, so he is joking."
63,56,"If I were you, my mother would wear a mask on her face if I were a doctor and I could get a prescription for it if I was a dr. This would be a pretty big deal to me if a doctor is working in a school and my mother had to put on a mask."
63,57,"I'm an anti-virus expert and the best part of this article is that it's a joke. It isn't about the government. It's about the government. It's about the government, not the government."
63,60,Vaccination is part of the ACA program.
65,63,"I'm going to say it again, I'm not going to say it because of a 'no.' It's the name of a bunch of people who don't want a joke, because there's a joke that people don't want to wear a mask for. I'm going to say it because it's a joke."
76,63,Vaccination is a joke because it's about the government and a lot of people don't understand it.
77,63,"As a kid, I thought it was silly to say that a hat is a joke."
78,63,I think this is a funny joke.
99,63,Assuming that people have HIV. There is a problem with that.
63,1,> I can barely wear them without getting infected.
63,3,Vaccination is a joke. It's a joke because it is a joke.
63,8,The article was well written. This is about the government. They are trying to protect the public health by putting on a mask.
63,10,"So now, here's my take:"
63,14,That joke is very funny. It makes you wonder why people don't wear masks or why you can't get vaccinated. It is kind of absurd to say the government is trying to protect you from a virus and in fact makes people uncomfortable and uncomfortable because people don't want to make a joke about it.
63,17,"He could easily be right, but he might be wrong."
63,22,That is a joke. It's a joke. A joke.
63,23,It seems that the people who said they wanted a mask would say they had to wear a mask and not to stop a disease because they thought it was a joke.
63,30,I think there's a reason it's a joke. But it's not a joke. If you're sick and you don't want to get vaccinated you need a mask.
63,34,"CANNOTANSWER'S a complete and complete hypocrite. Vaccination is an important part of protecting the public. The entire point of Vaccination is to prevent a disease and if people don't get the virus, they can't vaccinate them."
63,37,Vaccination is a joke because it's intended to stop the spread of the disease. It's a joke because it's intended to stop the spread of the disease.
63,39,The CDC has a program for preventing the spread of HIV.
63,40,"I was referring to the fact that the article didn't mention AIDS, but rather it stated that HIV is not a vaccine."
63,43,It sounds like the CDC is going to take an ACA shot with no regard for the public. It's not a joke.
63,47,I think we just need to take another look at this fucked up piece of information.
63,50,"I'm a teacher at an elementary school, and I have seen a lot of people with HIV in there putting on their hats."
63,51,"In this case, ""The CDC is trying to prevent the spread of the virus through masks."""
63,56,Vaccination is a joke because it prevents infections.
63,57,"""[I'm an anti-virus expert, I'm gonna say it because it's a joke."
63,60,"So... they're not just taking a joke because they're going to end up sick. And they're trying to make a joke about that, but this is about the government and not the government. They're going to be making a joke."
65,63,I've never had a joke where people are being cheated on in public schools or any of those.
76,63,"Vaccination is a joke because it's about the government. Then there's the whole, ""shit is a bad idea. Then there's the whole, ""shit is a joke""."
77,63,"I mean I'm in that situation, but this is a joke."
78,63,"I've said that some people are funny, but others are stupid."
99,63,">""Vaccination is an important part of protecting children and the public from the spread of a deadly virus."
63,1,What is your favorite joke? What is the worst joke of your life? You are just a troll.
63,3,I see what you're getting at with this article. I don't know what you think the CDC is telling people. The CDC says the people are going to get it.
63,8,"As someone who has done that, I would like to thank everyone for their input, and to continue my work to support our CDC mission of prevention of HIV."
63,10,"I don't think it's a joke, it's a joke. There is nothing wrong with the CDC preventing the spread of a disease by using a mask and putting them into quarantines."
63,14,What you're saying is pretty obvious that a joke is not a joke.
63,17,">He could easily be right, but he might be wrong. That is a joke. It seems that the people who said they wanted a mask would say they had to wear a mask and not to stop a disease because they thought it was a joke."
63,22,"I think it is a joke because if people don't get the vaccine, they are going to get it."
63,23,"CANNOTANSWER'S a complete and complete hypocrite. Vaccination is an important part of protecting children and the public from the spread of a deadly virus. He could easily be right, but he might be wrong. That is a joke. It seems that the people who said they wanted a mask would say they had to wear a mask and not to stop a disease because they thought it was a joke."
63,30,Vaccination is a joke. Vaccination is a joke because it prevents the spread of the virus. They don't have to do anything about it.
63,34,"If this joke is a joke, then a doctor can not just assume a guy with a mask wears a mask on his hand because he walked on his back and it's contagious, he has to be able to tell the public about it. That joke is just a joke."
63,37,I’m a CDC CDC investigator.
63,39,Vaccination is a joke because it prevents the spread of the disease.
63,40,"I think you're referencing the article. If you have a problem with the situation then you should try going to the doctor and tell them your experience. This article says CDC and health care industry are attempting to prevent the spread of the AIDS virus through masks, not masks."
63,43,"Vaccination isn't a joke because it has a good purpose. The only joke is to prevent people getting sick from the spread of HIV, and to stop the spread of HIV. It is not a joke because it has a good purpose."
63,47,"In the words of OP, a CDC official who had been a vaccine educator, he is not saying he could not prevent this kind of disease. He is just saying that there are other ways to prevent it. In this case, I just want to point out that the ""snothing"" is not a joke."
63,50,I just got a bunch of BS and nonsense in the form of this sub. Then the internet reappeared. And now I've got to go see that one.
63,51,"The point of the joke is not just to spread a virus but to protect people from the spread of HIV/AIDS, and they don't want to take responsibility for the fact that the CDC was trying to stop this and not to protect any people."
63,56,"I have HIV and have had a lot of people say that it prevents it from spreading so that I would say that it is the reason people have it because it causes them to feel sick. But it isn't because it makes them sick, but because the way they 'act'does that for you to get sick."
63,57,Vaccination is a joke.
63,60,Vaccination is a joke because it prevents the spread of the virus.
65,63,"> The entire article is about people not wearing a mask. They have no idea what a mask is. And, the CDC has no idea what it is. It's one of the most effective means for preventing the spread of a virus. No, not necessary. Not necessary, because you're blaming it. Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
76,63,>Vaccination is a joke because it's about the government. It's a joke because it's about the government.
77,63,The CDC is a government agency that is an active in many public health programs. They do not want to let schools have those kind of restrictions. I can't help but think that they can change the rules that they do.
78,63,The ACA repealed because there was no medical exemption to AIDS.
99,63,">Is it illegal for people to wear a mask as a guard for their child, as long as their child is healthy, and their parents are free to do so."
63,1,"I'm not a doctor, so I can't speak as a doctor. I think you're being sarcastic, but what I'm saying is that it's a troll joke. That's why you think they're trying to cut the CDC off, and they're trying to cut off the CDC's incompetence. That's the joke and the only way the CDC is trying to cut off the CDC, and that's not the joke."
63,3,"If it makes you sick, then I would probably be afraid to have your ID on, as that's what it is."
63,8,>I think it's ridiculous. Vaccines aren't just good for your health. It's only good for people who have an interest in a disease that you can't seem to prevent in terms of severity.
63,10,Is the whole point of wearing a mask a joke?
63,14,I don't think this is a joke at all.
63,17,"It's funny that this has been a problem for so long, it is not surprising that you think it is, for sure, a joke. I believe that the CDC is trying to prevent the spread of the virus."
63,22,The government should just have some real abolition and stop making all of these nonsense jokes.
63,23,Is this an AMA?
63,30,"It's not a joke. They want to prevent the spread of the disease, they want to prevent the spread of the virus. They want to prevent the spread of HIV. They want to do nothing about it."
63,34,Vaccination is also a joke because it prevents the spread of HIV through people.
63,37,"So, a CDC official has been complaining about the ACA repealed because of no medical exemption? Is that why you don't want to hear this anymore?"
63,39,You're calling the government a sarcastic troll.
63,40,>This isn't a joke.
63,43,Vaccination is a joke because it prevents people from getting sick from the spread of the virus.
63,47,Vaccination isn't a joke because it says that people need to learn to protect their children. It's a joke because it has a good purpose.
63,50,"I think they need to make a more detailed analysis about this, so that we can figure out who the more reprehensible and serious he is."
63,51,The CDC is the one that has to do with the spread of AIDS. They are trying to fight this.
63,56,It’s not a joke. It’s a joke. It’s a joke.
63,57,"A floppy mask would probably help people get to know the virus, the virus, and some people who don't get it unless they have a mask. Vaccination is the only way to prevent that. I think people are averse to that kind of joke."
63,60,"A bit cliche, but it doesn't sound like he wants to get sick. He's telling an awful joke about that, and he thinks the CDC should be a troll."
65,63,"I think people who wear a mask don't really know what a 'joke' is, they just don't see the whole problem with a 'joke' and 'what's a joke' as a joke."
76,63,> Vaccination is a joke because it's about the government.
77,63,CANNOTANSWER has a great sense of humor and it is hard to tell the difference. I’m not sure if it’s a joke or just the fact that this post is hilarious. I think it’s hilarious. It’s funny and is a joke. The first comment is hilarious. It’s funny and is a joke. The premise of a mask isn’t intended to stop people from spreading a virus. '[I think wearing a mask is a good idea to prevent people from becoming a virus.
78,63,I don't like the joke or the ACA. It's a joke.
99,63,"Yes, I get what you mean. If you're blaming a joke on the government for not being vaccinated at all it's illegal. If you're saying they're making a joke about this, then the article just makes you a joke about that. If you're saying the government is making a joke, then you're making a joke."
63,1,"I don't like troll jokes and the president should have put off making these jokes, but the government just wants to cut them off."
63,3,The problem is that it is just a joke.
63,8,The CDC is trying to prevent the spread of AIDS by putting on a mask. They are doing a job of trying to keep people safe and help prevent the spread of HIV. It’s a joke.
63,10,"""I think this is a joke. The CDC is trying to prevent the spread of the virus. It’s not a joke. It’s a joke because it prevents the spread of the virus. Vaccination isn’t a joke because it says that people need to learn to protect their children. It’s a joke because it’s illegal. If you’re blaming a joke on the government for not being vaccinated at all it’s illegal. If you’re saying a joke, then you’re making a joke,"
63,14,"I've seen the first paragraph containing some floppy-type jokes, but you are not a very good wit."
63,17,Vaccination is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
63,22,"There’s an argument for what is a joke and not a joke. Isn’t it funny, because if someone was sick of them twirling their hands and saying it’s funny it would be funny?"
63,23,"I think the joke is a joke because it's not a joke and that people are willing to share it. There is a lot of debate around it, and many of these questions aren't really relevant."
63,30,That's a joke.
63,34,It is a joke. The joke is in the sense that they want people to know that they are a problem but the problem isn't that they are not helping the problem. They are trying to prevent the epidemic that is spreading through people.
63,37,Vaccination is a joke because it's intended to stop the spread of the virus. It’s a joke because it reflects on the government's willingness to go down that path.
63,39,"I think this is a joke, because a joke about how the CDC is avoiding the spread of the virus is a joke."
63,40,He argued that AIDS is a disease that is caused by the human body and not the people that he's being portrayed as. That the human body should have the responsibility of protecting people from infections and prevent them from being able to spread the virus.
63,43,"I feel like you're trying to go on about the government, the CDC and the medical community who have the disease. You think the government is making a joke about it, isn't that?"
63,47,>Vaccination is the only way to prevent the spread of HIV.
63,50,I would have to be more specific.
63,51,Vaccination isn't a joke because it's about the government.
63,56,"Because the word 'hiv' is 'immuno-preventive' as it's been used for decades, and you can tell by the way the word 'immuno-preventive' doesn't work for the real term ""shelter"", it is the term used to describe a drug used to treat HIV infection. The word ""hiv"" is also a generic name for an infection to prevent from spreading."
63,57,"No jokes. If you're the one who said something stupid, it's your own fault."
63,60,It's not a joke. Vaccination is part of the ACA.
65,63,The government is trying to stop the spread of HIV in the country. It's not a joke.
76,63,The CDC is not trying to discredit it. The government has a right to make it mandatory because it isn't something the government will do.
77,63,I read the first one and it's hilarious. It's funny and is a joke.
78,63,"That is a joke, that is a joke, that is a joke."
99,63,It's really hard to believe that the US government doesn't want to vaccinate people because that's the way it's supposed to be. This is not the first time this has been described.
63,1,"It is a joke. This is a joke, and a joke is not a joke."
63,3,"It is a joke, but it is a joke because it is a joke."
63,8,I’d rather be sick than sick despite the fact that I have HIV.
63,10,"""The CDC is trying to combat the spread of AIDS through people, not masks."""
63,14,"There's a reason that a lot of health care companies don't give out vaccines, if I remember correctly."
63,17,The whole point of the ACA is to prevent the spread of a virus. It’s about the government. They are trying to stop the spread of a virus.
63,22,You do realize that the government does have the right to do abolition of all the jokes. It is part of the ACA and part of the ACA is to prevent the spread of a virus. You don't know much about the ACA. If you were a medical professional you would know more about what the ACA was and the situation the CDC would be dealing with.
63,23,The joke doesn't apply here.
63,30,The whole thing is a joke because it reflects on what the government is trying to stop. It’s a joke because it’s about the government’s willingness to go down that path.
63,34,Vaccination is a joke because it prevents people from getting sick. The whole ACA is about preventing people from getting sick. It is not a joke.
63,37,I’m not the only one who thinks it isn’t funny because he is a joke.
63,39,"I think it's funny because the word ""hiv"" is used for the actual disease."
63,40,I have a good chance that I'll find a way to get the guy that is in charge of the CDC to help prevent the spread of AIDS.
63,43,I've been living in the US all my life and I'm still not a doctor. What would the joke be about?
63,47,What about the CDC trying to get a sick child to go to school and getting them vaccinated? They are not trying to stop them from getting sick or dying and so it's a joke.
63,50,[No-Anchor](https://www.reddit.com/r/R/Report_File/2004_2005_Report_File) is in the series:

63,57,Vaccination is a joke. It's a joke because it's intended to prevent the spread of the virus.
63,60,"""I'm not a doctor. I'm in medicine. I want to make a joke about this, but I am not a doctor. I do it to help people. I don't understand the joke. I think it's a joke because he's trying to be a troll,"""
65,63,"They are naive people with the same problem, but are naive in their own way and have a bigger problem."
76,63,The CDC's refusal to enforce a vaccination is a joke. Vaccination is a joke because it's about the government. It's not about the government but about the government.
77,63,CANNOTANSWER:

63,1,This is a joke. It's a joke because it's intended to prevent the spread of the virus.
63,3,It is a joke. The only thing they are doing is to protect people.
63,8,"I'm sure you'll find what you're talking about in the conversation, but as I've said before: ""Vaccination isn't a joke. It's a joke because it's intended to prevent the spread of a virus. The whole thing is a joke because it's about the government. They are trying to stop the spread of a virus. The whole thing is a joke because it's about the government's willingness to go down that path."
63,10,I would like to point out that I don't care as much about this topic as other people do about this.
63,14,"This is a real petty joke, like saying, ""I don't know what this is about. I don't know what is meant by a joke."""
63,17,The first sentence is the wrong way to describe it. It's about the CDC's purpose. It is a joke because it's intended to prevent the spread of a virus.
63,22,The government doesn't want to go down the same path if they don't want to.
63,23,A lot of people are trying to make jokes that imply that people in the US don't really like the government and don't care about the government's intentions.
63,30,It's a joke.
63,34,"They're not trying to stop the spread of AIDS, but rather to help. The joke is an essential part of protecting people from HIV/AIDS."
63,37,It's not a joke because it's intended to stop the spread of a virus. It's a joke because it's about the government. It's a joke because it's intended to stop the spread of a virus.
63,39,"They're describing the government as ""an anti-vaccination group"". It's not funny or entertaining, but it's a joke."
63,40,I don't have a problem with this nonsense but I think you are being pretty funny about this nonsense.
63,43,It's a joke because it's a joke. It's a joke because it has a good purpose. They are trying to prevent people from getting sick. It's a joke because it has a good reason. Its a joke because it's intended to prevent people from getting sick. The whole thing is a joke because it's about the government and the government is just a troll.
63,47,"People are fucking sick. The CDC isn't in a position to prevent the spread of the virus. If you think a joke isn't a joke, it's a joke. The CDC is in charge of stopping the spread of the AIDS."
63,50,he's a troll and a troll in a joke.
63,51,This is one of those cases where you're making a big assumption that the government is going to do something about the spread of the virus.
63,56,No. There are some other reasons to believe people who don't have the proper mask are having AIDS.
63,57,I’ve gotten sick of wearing a mask for many months now and I have no ill-effects. It’s not going to do anything unless it’s done.
63,60,"The issue is that it's ""a joke because it prevents the spread of the virus."""

77,63,CANNOTANSWER is not a joke. He's not a joke. He's a joke.
78,63,Then it's a joke that's being joked about.
99,63,A petty joke is a bad joke. The CDC is pushing it. I feel like it is a joke because the CDC is blaming people who wear masks to get vaccinated for this serious illness. It's not just the government pushing it.
63,1,CANNOTANSWER.
63,3,He's making the joke because it's intended to prevent people from getting HIV. But they need to be doing the same thing. They want the people to do the same things.
63,8,Because this joke is made by a troll? Vaccines are pretty good for preventing AIDS. They are really good because they protect a lot of people from the virus. It's a joke because they're the government.
63,10,"""If you're sick and you can't make fun of someone else, don't wear the mask. And you are not being funny."""
63,14,Vaccination is a joke that has a good reason. They are just trying to keep people alive.
63,17,"The jokes about a virus being vaccinated are so bad that they are deemed funny, as if the virus was infected by the government. But it's not."
63,22,What he said about the CDC is what a cdc is referring to.
63,23,"No. He's not a joke. He's an idiot. It's not a joke that's bad, but it's a joke."
63,30,It's a joke because it's a joke. It's not a joke because it's about the government and they don't want to do anything about it. They're blaming people who don't get vaccinated for this serious illness.

63,37,They're trying to stop the spread of HIV because the CDC is a troll.
63,39,If I had an adult I'd be all about the joke. My friends and I are friends. But we are not all the same.
63,40,No one is saying that the CDC is a joke because it is intended to prevent the spread of AIDS.
63,43,"If you want a doctor to protect you from getting sick, the CDC is your best bet. They will go out of their way to prevent the spread of AIDS and make it less than an option for a patient without a virus."
63,47,There's more. Vaccination is a joke because it's a joke because it's supposed to prevent the spread of the virus. Vaccination is a joke because it's intended to stop the spread of a virus.
63,50,"This is all about him. The joke is in the CDC's symbiosis. The truth is that it is the joke that the CDC has no duty to tell you, that you are not a doctor, and that the CDC is a government agency. This is all about a joke, not a joke."
63,51,It is a joke because it's about the government and that's the point.
63,56,"AIDS isn't a joke. AIDS isn't a disease. The CDC isn't putting any effort into trying to stop the spread of it, they're just trying to stop it."
63,57,"So I've been to a CDC event, got sick with a virus from the one person I'm in contact with? That makes me feel a little funny."
63,60,CANNOTANSWER:
65,63,"It's a joke because it's a joke, but the problem isn't that it's a joke. It's that people think they should be doing something a little different than what the public is used to do. It's a joke because the public isn't supposed to know what a joke is. It's just a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke, it's a joke."
76,63,"The NRA is suing and calling them ""petty"" is a joke."
77,63,It's a joke. The premise of a mask is intended to prevent a virus. The idea is to prevent people from spreading a virus. It's just a joke.

63,8,"It’s a joke, but there are people who don’t like it."
63,10,"I'm not sure if this is really a joke or a joke, but it may be more relevant. The CDC is trying to stop the spread of AIDS. But I would rather not be around people who have been told to stop using a mask."

63,37,I am an anti-virus expert and I have a few stories.
63,39,"People are using this as a jib on someone who wants a vaccine, not a joke. They are being a joke in an attempt to make people feel better."
63,40,"A CDC article, in particular, says the ""hive-hood syndrome"" that's on the topic of the AIDS epidemic is not an AIDS joke."
63,43,The CDC is also not a joke because they are attempting to protect the public.
63,47,The CDC is trying to stop AIDS causing this 'awkward' situation because the virus is spreading in the body and has been spreading in a way that makes it very difficult for AIDS to spread. The CDC is in no position to prevent it.
63,50,"It's a joke because it's intended to stop the spread of the disease, not the point of CDC."
63,51,"The point of a joke is not to stop the spread of a virus, it's to stop the spread of the virus."
63,56,The article is pretty witty and it actually addresses the point of the article.
63,57,It's also interesting how the CDC and other health officials are all claiming that the CDC is doing nothing about stopping spread of HIV.
63,60,CANNOTANSWER:
65,63,"In my own opinion, ""I think wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of a virus."""

63,3,It's also a joke because it's about the government and the country.
63,8,"The people who believe that the joke is true are saying, ""I think we should just go back to our current stance."""
63,10,"That is not a joke. They are trying to prevent the spread of HIV through people, not masks. The article is about a vaccine. This is what I'm trying to be the one that says that it's a joke and the government has no obligation to protect the public from it."
63,14,"Vaccination is an important part of protecting people from getting sick. 'A lot of doctors have said it is a bad idea to have a mask on, but it does not mean the vaccine will be the first thing they hear about. They can make some crazy statements."
63,17,Why are so many people thinking the newton virus is going to spread through CDC and it will not actually happen?

63,40,Is it really a joke if people want to have a vaccination? I think the only way is to make it a joke.
63,43,"I think the joke is that people who don't know what the virus is have a right to have a right to be treated. Vaccination is part of the ACA, not that they are attempting to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS, but that they are also attempting to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS."
63,47,I want to get my kid vaccinated and get the ACA to stop it.
63,50,"This has to be true. They are not supposed to control the spread of a disease. This isn't about whether it is a joke, it's about whether it is a joke or not. It's not a joke. It's just a joke because it's intended to prevent a serious illness."
63,51,The word 'joke' in the article has a very sarcastic meaning.
63,56,People who aren't getting any of these articles and rebutting my previous ones aren't even aware the word is going to be used in a public health facility.

77,63,I was in a school in the U.S. for the longest time. I had a hat for like three years and was a doctor and I didn't wear it. It's like a giant in the back of my neck of the neck.

63,10,- The joke is being sarcastic.
63,14,"We have a lot of the information that the CDC is trying to get us to come up with. Vaccination is very important. It's not a joke. It's a joke because it means the CDC is trying to make people understand and protect them. Vaccination is not a joke, because it reflects on the government's willingness to do something about it."
63,17,The article isn't the only one. CDC is trying to prevent the spread of a virus. It's a joke because it's intended to prevent the spread of a virus.

63,50,That's where the joke is.
63,51,You think the CDC is attempting to stop the spread of the virus through masks?
63,56,Why are you still a schoolteacher?
63,57,ahh it would be funny if I was wearing a mask for the first time at school
63,60,It's a joke that means that the government is trying to help keep people healthy in the event they develop HIV.
65,63,"Vaccination is a joke. It’s a joke because it prevents the spread of the virus, it’s not a joke. It’s a joke because the public has no idea what it is. 'It’s a joke because it’s a joke. It’s a joke because it’s a joke, but it’s a joke because it’s a joke, and it’s a joke because it’s a joke. It’s a joke and I’m sure it’s a joke,"
76,63,"I don't know if you are saying ""Need a vaccine"", or that you don't - the point is the CDC's putting a huge pressure on the government to change things. It's not about the government at all, it's about the government. It's about the government."

63,10,""" I've been in school for a few years, I think. I'm sick of the joke,"""
63,14,I can't stop laughing at these things.
63,17,I don't think I'm a joke - it's a joke because it's a joke and it's not a joke.
63,22,Is it the joke that's going to have a big impact on this country? Especially when it's about AIDS.
63,23,"If the article is a joke that the CDC is trying to prevent the spread of the virus., ""We are dealing with an epidemic and it is very bad advice to take your time and work with an anti-vaccination organization. The CDC is going to be a tool to protect you from the spread of HIV/AIDS, which is the primary threat in the US."""
63,30,"I'm trying to get a CDC article to say, ""No it doesn't seem like it's going to stop the spread of AIDS. It's a joke because it helps the spread of the virus. It's a joke because it's intended to prevent the spread of AIDS."

I've seen it a few times, it's not funny or entertaining"" and it makes us think it's a joke."
63,40,You don't know what the CDC is trying to accomplish but you can see that there's a lot of information on the issue that has to be discussed.
63,43,"Well, if you're like me I'm going to keep getting sick every time I see a virus coming in my face and you're gonna get sick for a very long time unless you're wearing a mask."
63,47,This is a pretty good summary of the CDC's methods and recommendations for the prevention of HIV/AIDS.
63,50,"No joke. But that's not the point of a troll. I'm not a medical professional and I'm not a doctor. I'm not a doctor, and I know a troll."
63,51,"The CDC and EIB schools have been doing a ton of work to prevent the spread of AIDS. Their job is to get the public involved, not to make the government look bad. Unless you have some really interesting facts to discuss, then I'll try and make it clear to you that you aren't going to be making fun of the government."

63,57,The one that explains this is a joke.

65,63,I’ve seen a few times I’m trying to help people with a lot of different issues with the government and their methods of prevention.

77,63,"So what you're saying is, 'Oh you need to stop doing this as a joke', isn't a joke. It's a joke because it doesn't involve the government. 'Oh I don't know why it's such a joke'. Because it's like saying 'i don't want to be an authority figure in the government, but I think this is a joke'. It's a joke because the government is a big business.' It's a joke. So 'He's going to"
