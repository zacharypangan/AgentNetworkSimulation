70,51,i love coaching however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops
81,51,says the woman that wears the mask to protect herself lmao well dear the gun works the mask doesn t
99,51,oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that
51,29,"What a waste of time! We are going to see a mask ban soon, and this is a time to come down to the issues with them."
63,51,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.yes the newest strain is soooooo contagious just bc they have a mask on their hands pics don t mean they re using it

99,51,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
51,29,"I think we should rethink our attitudes towards masks... if you have to wear a mask for any reason, it snuffs."
63,51,"It isn't a bad idea, but you're implying that the current strain of the virus is soooooo contagious they're not actually infecting other people. So there are some pretty good examples that the recent strain is very contagious. It's not as if people in the U.S. are at all, but the idea that it's actually not is just silly."
70,51,That one's the most annoying part of the whole thing
81,51,"I like the quote and the video a lot, but i hate that they are so oversimplified"
99,51,He didn't get a mask until he got his first vaccine. He never said he should wear it.

81,51,"If you wear a mask, you are going to die."
99,51,"I'm sorry, but this is a silly joke that's not about the mask. The joke is about the masks being used as protection against a virus. This is a topic that should be brought up at any time or another, right?"
51,29,"I think that's a good point. We are attempting to combat the spread of a virus. It's not as if people in the U.S. are at all, but the idea that it's actually not is just silly."
63,51,"I have had one for a long time, I'm so glad it helped me get through it and have no other side effects to go on."
70,51,"I gotta say that you're the one that should stop, that's the best thing I've ever said."
81,51,I think people will learn that wearing a mask in public is a big part of stopping the spread of a virus.
99,51,What kind of doctor is it? It would really be something to be worried about if it was a virus. It's really not about a mask. It's about the people who are not going to be able to do it.
51,29,"IANAL. EDIT: Oh my God, I'm a little sad to hear that. I'm just imagining that this is the world that we live in today and you can have a good one, because there are so many people who could eat and do a job with you. I really don't know how I could think of a better thing."
63,51,"You are using the word ""sarcasm"" incorrectly."
70,51,"What I am seeing is that in your post, ""We have a lot of players who are not wearing a mask"", you are just saying, ""We have a lot of players who are not wearing a mask""."
81,51,This is the first time that I have heard that the US President is using a face mask.
99,51,"OP has a good point, but I think the point is that the government should keep it on the side of the people, as the public has to know what the people who are going to get sick might do to protect themselves from the vaccinated ones."
51,29,"I'm not sure what I feel. I have no idea if the government will be able to ban it because they're out to save people. But I just can't see why people would do it if they don't know about it if they know they are getting sick, which is a really interesting point."
63,51,"""They are attempting to combat the spread of the virus through people, not masks."""
70,51,So you are like [President Trump](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditMemes/r/RideCityMemes.aspx?subtext=raised-by_President_Trump_neo-hist-sssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
81,51,That's why the president is wearing a mask. He said it's about the spread of a virus. This is how vaccines work.
99,51,"Vaccination is a medical necessity, it entails getting vaccinated."
51,29,"I was just imagining that when someone says something like, ""Have you ever had a funny face?""? I mean, I know, that sounds funny, but you're being so sarcastic."
63,51,"The CDC makes you uncomfortable. They are a private body with no mandate, and you aren't going to get to make that decision. They are not doing anything for you, they're just trying to keep you safe."
70,51,CANNOTANSWER OP??
81,51,"As a Canadian I'd like to add that, even if I said they weren't required by law, the mask is a pretty bad idea to put on people who can't afford it and are only in a few years of clinical trials."
99,51,"I know that's funny. If I were on the side of people I would never get sick, as a joke. I was just about to say this:"
51,29,He is a terrible President. He is going to put on a mask to keep people safe and it should be a mandatory condition unless it is a virus.
63,51,"I'd really like to ask you if you have a copy of the article that says it's not a joke, but a joke."
70,51,"""Personally speaking, you don't need to wear a mask, because it is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. The fact that he's wearing it properly under a helmet, despite the reality of what happened is a humbling sign."", ""I don't think he is a reeeally shit."
81,51,"It's called ""The government is not willing to admit that their behavior is wrong or a good thing."""
99,51,There's a video of this guy demonstrating why he needs to be vaccinated. I was just about to say he just cried.
51,29,"I see a couple of things going on. One is the fact that he’s wearing it under a helmet, is a little embarrassing, and the other is the fact that he is able to put it on. The question is, “How did he learn to rape people while wearing a mask?”"
63,51,I think this is kind of funny. What's the point of a CDC employee? You have no idea how that goes? The CDC has been trying to stop the spread of the virus through masks for years?
70,51,"I can't imagine any president in the history of our country not wearing a mask, but the infamous ""RideCityMemes"" where it's the top comment that isn't ""raised by the neo-hists""."
81,51,Vaccination is not required for everyone unless the person is in an advanced stage of a clinical trial. That's why the president is wearing a mask.
99,51,The fact that people are being treated with a mask is not an accurate indicator of how serious a problem is in the medical community.
51,29,"'They are attempting to combat the spread of the virus through people, not masks."
63,51,"I’m a school teacher and I’m sure that I understand people not understanding the problem. Why do you want to work in a school with a CDC? In that video, he talks about how it's putting people in quarantines when they get sick. He also claims that they aren’t doing anything for the prevention of the spread. They aren’t doing anything for the prevention of the spread. They aren’t doing anything for the prevention of the spread."
70,51,"""You don't need to wear a mask, because it is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. The fact that he's wearing it properly under a helmet is a great sign of him having a career, he deserves it and I love him."""
81,51,Vaccination is not required for everyone unless the person is in an advanced stage of a clinical trial. Vaccination is not required for everyone unless the person is in an advanced stage of a clinical trial. That's why the president is wearing a mask.
99,51,The CDC is blaming women wearing masks because they can't get their child vaccinated and that means that if they didn't know the facts about their child they would get their child vaccinated.
51,29,"The first part of the story is a little misleading. As a teacher, I am going to be stoked if my boss doesn't read the article."
63,51,"A CDC employee could easily do this, so I think he might be off the hook. ""I don't see what a troll joke means. They aren't doing anything for you, they're just trying to keep you safe."""
70,51,I'm not sure what this is about. It sounds like the president is being racist.
81,51,>The President is being stupid and sarcastic. He made a legitimate argument and I am not surprised by the response.
99,51,A joke about how it's a joke isn't a joke. It's an actual joke. This is a joke about the fact that people who haven't gotten vaccinated are not taking the time to have a look at it.
51,29,...and what he did was pretty funny.
63,51,People get sick of the ACA. The CDC and public health institutions should be doing more to halt the spread of the virus. The CDC and private health services should work together in a way that prevents the spread of the virus. The government shouldn't be being used as a platform to spread the virus. So we should put a stop to this.
70,51,>How is it possible to make it all better?
81,51,I don't know what you are talking about. But I've always liked the quote. It's just what I thought it meant.
99,51,He was vaccinated from the same type of virus as a sex slave in China. He's still alive and cured from what he found.
51,29,CDC has an innate innate instinct for the sick to wear a mask when they're afraid of what might be coming. If people can't wear it when sick then they should be able to put their child in quarantine.
63,51,What the CDC is trying to prevent is the spread of HIV/AIDS a lot. That and the fact that there's already a lot of research to see if it was actually spreading.
70,51,">I love coaching however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops"""
81,51,This is just a good example of how to help those in need by protecting their own health.
99,51,"I'm going to go get some e-readers to understand it, so I can make a joke about it as a good start."
51,29,"""It sounds like the president is being racist."""
63,51,Vaccination is better than having your health checked for a flu like it is with HIV.
70,51,It's not a joke. It's just something people say.
81,51,"I can only describe it as a ""Jake"" and I find it interesting that there's a joke in the title."
99,51,Vaccination is not a petty joke.
51,29,I really think a mask is a bad idea. It doesn't look like you're going to make any of that happen.
63,51,What if the CDC is really going to stop this from happening?
70,51,I love all the anti-terrorist stuff I read on r/reddit. That's why I'm surprised a lot of people are genuinely upset. Obviously it's not a joke. It's just a fucking joke.
81,51,"This is my own interpretation of a joke, and is my idiocy, and a part of a problem with my life. I would rather spend time with my family in the country than in the country to see if I could actually help others. I know where you are coming from and I see what you're saying."
99,51,I'm going to go make a joke about this.
51,29,Vaccination is better than having your health checked for a flu like it is with HIV. It's not a joke. It's just a petty joke.
63,51,I was the one who actually jumped into the joke about a male being able to wear a mask and not a male. The fact that it would be funny to get the CDC's attention is quite pathetic.
70,51,"I agree with you, I don't think this is a joke. It's just a fucking joke. What's this about?"
81,51,I would rather spend time with my family in the country than in the country to see if I could actually help others.
99,51,">I think the CDC is trying to force the people to get vaccinated, rather than the government."
51,29,Why should the federal government be responsible for such a big shit mess like this? Why should a president just bring in some clown?
63,51,"In a way, the CDC is trying to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS, which is a very dangerous disease, but not for health reasons that would stop the spread of HIV/AIDS."
70,51,I was just reading the article that said it's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
81,51,>The president is being stupid and sarcastic. He made a legitimate argument and I am not surprised by the response.
99,51,This is the first time the government has taken a position to make an effort to change the law.
51,29,"I'm an American. I don't know how to be a joke - he was pretty much the person that jumped into the joke. He was just making fun of the president for his behavior, not just what he had said. The article is also a bit misleading. ""This is a joke"" isn't even a joke."
63,51,I would be willing to bet that a doctor will come into school and start laughing about the issue.
70,51,"'(Personally speaking, you don't need to wear a mask, because it is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
81,51,I hate that jokes are a part of a problem with my life. I would rather spend time with my family in the country than in the country to see if I could actually help others.
99,51,Vaccination is a medical necessity. It is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
51,29,"It's one thing to wear a mask at school to protect against the spread of a virus, and another to have the parents get in the way of the virus. That's an issue that is important to a lot of people, and it's something you can't get through a school without having to suffer for years."
63,51,"[Not just an anti-viral joke, it's an anti-semitic joke."
70,51,">I'm not a racist, but I do believe that because the joke is about the whites, then the government should be responsible for the masking of their facial hair."
81,51,'Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus'
99,51,This is something I read a lot as an Englishman and a student of English. The first thing I read was the word 'catch'. Not 'i'. It was the first time I've ever seen someone say that a number of things had changed in a country.
51,29,"I've read a couple of quotes about the president, not sure what that is, but it's not a joke."
63,51,Vaccination is a joke. There is nothing wrong with using it as an excuse to have a fever.
70,51,"I gotta say that you're the one that should stop, that's the best thing I've ever said.''"
81,51,"That's the best joke in the book. It's the most antisemitic, not only antisemitic of all."
99,51,I don't like having to wear a mask.
51,29,"It is just a joke, and a joke isn't a joke. It's just a joke."
63,51,"People are misunderstanding that, as a doctor who got a sick patient with HIV, it is a joke. It is an actual joke."
70,51,"And it was an official and not an official. And it's a joke, not a joke."
81,51,"It's an antisemitic joke, in my opinion, and I'd like to agree with it in another way."
99,51,"People who get vaccinated, on a public health diet, should always be the first to take the time to have it on. I believe most people are now able to get vaccines because it is much easier than they thought. They can also get vaccines with the help of some medical professional or health insurance."
51,29,"What the actual jokes about Obama being a racist are, as in, sarcastic. The article teaches you how to use a faked word (which is usually a joke) to disguise a joke."
63,51,A man can do that and he is going to be fine. A doctor needs to be okay with this joke.
70,51,"""'We have a lot of players who are not wearing a mask, you are just saying, ""We have a lot of players who are not wearing a mask"".'"""
81,51,"It's a joke. It's not about the fact that it has a funny title, it's about the fact that the president wears a mask because he doesn't want to hear what his bf is saying, and not if he has a good reason not to wear one."
99,51,Vaccination is a joke. I'm just saying that the government should be responsible for the people who decide what the shit is going on.
51,29,"""It's an antisemitic joke, 'Why should the government be responsible for such a big shit mess like this?"""
63,51,"Vaccination is a joke a lot of teachers do not understand. They want the public to understand and help spread the disease, and as such, they don't see it as a joke."
70,51,i think it's a joke. I think it's a joke. I think it is a joke.
81,51,"""I'm in the process of starting to understand what the president is saying."""
99,51,"I'm not saying that the CDC doesn't have the government's support. The CDC does. It's not, not the people. It's a joke. They've tried to make it illegal for years, but they're trying to make it legal and they're trying to make it illegal. They say they don't care. It's just an attempt to make it illegal."
51,29,Vaccination is an antisemitic joke.
63,51,Vaccination is a joke. It's a joke. It is a joke. Vaccination is a joke.
70,51,"I'm not saying I think it's a joke, I'm just saying it's a joke."
81,51,"I like this story as well, because I've been at it since high school."
99,51,Vaccination is a medical necessity. It entails getting vaccinated.
51,29,"I'm on a school health board that doesn't teach public health - and no - and so they have to ban it, because it's so much easier. I'm saying a mask is a joke, and a mask is a joke. I think it's a joke."
63,51,Vaccination is a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.
70,51,"In an interview with a conservative thinker, he said ""You should wear a mask because he can help the government by helping with prevention of cancer and a number of other things.""."

99,51,"A lot of times I've read these things. Vaccination is a joke. But a lot of people who can get it aren't 'obvious' people who want it. That being said, there's nothing 'nothing'that makes it a joke. It's not like there's anything 'nothing' that makes it a joke. It's a joke about a joke."
51,29,What do you think of this joke about vaccines?
63,51,You don't understand the joke?
70,51,"Yes, it is a joke, but I think it is. It's a joke, and I think it's a joke."
81,51,"He's being sarcastic, and a joke. This is the first time I have heard that the President is wearing a mask."
99,51,"So, the CDC is trying to change the laws to make it illegal, not just a joke."
51,29,I've always been against vaccination but it seems like a joke if you make it funny to your school board. They don't know what a joke is. But they know how to be funny.
63,51,"This is the CDC trying to prevent. You should never say that you don't understand the joke, or you should never mention it."
70,51,I believe the article argues that it is a joke.
81,51,I'm so sad that my family is sick and ill and there's no way I could care less about what they're experiencing.
99,51,"I think this is an excellent reference to the “Dad, why do you need to get vaccinated” type of joke."
51,29,"""An antisemitic joke isn't a joke."""
63,51,"If you're a doctor, a doctor, etc., don't wear a mask in public, or at a CDC/EIB school, you're going to get a good laugh at them if they don't even mention it."
70,51,The article is misleading and the headlines are misleading and this is one of the few instances of a troll comment.
81,51,"The author of the book is the editor of the documentary ""Snoop Dogg"" (Peter Cohn of the Reddit - who explains how the joke is interpreted in the book), who has a lot of experience in the field."
99,51,"I mean I would have a better idea of what they want to keep it on a legal limb but it's actually something you should be thinking about. Vaccination is a medical necessity in Texas and is mandatory. You're not required to wear a mask, but you must be able to do so at any time."
51,29,I've seen this book several times.
63,51,Vaccination is a joke because it's a joke for a reason.
70,51,"Assuming you mean a joke and not a joke, this isn't the article. This is an article. You're right. You're just being a joke."
81,51,"The sarcastic response comes out in a funny way. Then, I’ve seen this movie, and I think the sarcastic response comes out in a funny way. Then, I’ve seen this movie, and I think the sarcastic response comes out in a funny way. The joke isn’t really about what happens at the office, but rather that someone wants to make fun of them.

70,51,I'm surprised that so many people are upset about the article.

81,51,"I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic, but I think a sarcastic response might be the best way to interpret that. Unless the book is about Obama, and the president is not in the country to stop HIV/AIDS, then yes, the book is about the government.

99,51,"It was the first time I read about it, I was going to say it. It was kind of funny."
51,29,"No joke. This is not a joke. A joke is an antisemitic joke. You don't have to explain what it's about, and you can't make a joke about it. This is a joke because the government is trying to make it illegal."

99,51,"I thought it was a joke. It's funny because I'm not sure where it got its name, but I thought it was a joke."
51,29,A reversal of that is in the back of your mind. The actual joke is not a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke. It's not a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke.

51,29,No way. But I can see a joke that is sarcastic about the President and not how he's been trying to stop the spread of the virus.
63,51,"That's a really good question, but is the whole point of it being a joke?"

51,29,Is there any way that he's got a chance to have a laugh at the fact that he doesn't have the mask at all?
