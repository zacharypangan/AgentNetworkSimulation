83,26,ah ya i will just say the same thing about people who cant wear masks and dont want to be associated with the president. i agree that i hate the fact that we have a lot of pity for the president
83,38,I had a friend of mine with a mask and my brother and I were at the game the other day. They got a very friendly smile from him and said he would be my assistant if he saw me. He was a little terrified of him when we walked into the gym i guess he just turned around and wiped his head when we walked around. He thought he could have taken him to see me. he ended up saying something in his head about the fear and shame of being vaccinated.
83,53,I'd rather not play and have to go somewhere with a helmet.
83,56,> If one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops i love coaching
83,60,"Isn't that why the masks aren't in the game anymore? If so, I think you have a really good chance to win."
83,66,"If that's the case, I will be a coach."
83,68,This is about the government to get rid of the virus.
83,80,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

85,83,What is the name of the video for the movie?
91,83,How did the mask make his breath come out of the back of his head? I don't think it was supposed to make it come out of the back of his head.
96,83,I have a ton of fans that will say the same things about me because I love watching and watching people wear their masks as well.
100,83,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. I will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask
101,83,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
83,17,"When you wear the mask you fucking fucking get a lot of pity. I mean, I mean I hate that it's illegal to wear a mask while in a game. But I have to wear it when you're in the hospital."
83,26,You're a really bad man and I don't want to be associated with the president.
83,38,r/reddit is not about anything other than the meme about this.
83,53,"My best friend has a pair of masks that he has never worn before. He's a very good actor, he's a bit of a douche."
83,56,> If one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops i love coaching
83,60,That's really interesting.. I have a lot of fans that will say the same things about me because I love watching and watching people wear their masks as well.
83,66,I'm a football fan and like to read sports and I see this. This is very interesting and fucking funny.
83,68,"I would be a big fan of it if my coach told me to wear a helmet as well if I could. But the fact is I have a friend who does this and has an open mind about it a lot, i can not stand the idea of going to the game unless i want to."
83,80,"I am not saying I am a good coach, but it seems like a great deal of work and effort goes into making this work. The people who use it actually work on the problem."
85,83,"It's called 'Sorry, I don't need a mask'."
91,83,>How did the mask make his breath come out of the back of his head? I don't think it was supposed to make it come out of the back of his head.
96,83,"I have a mask. I was just able to put on one with my booster and when it got too close to the end, it stopped bleeding and made my head hurt. I still hate it. I don't wear a mask at all."
100,83,i think i m being very conservative.
101,83,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
83,17,">When you wear the mask you fucking fucking get a lot of pity. I mean, I mean, I hate that it's illegal to wear a mask while in a game. But I have to wear it when you're in the hospital."
83,26,The whole problem of wearing a mask is that it makes a LOT of sense.
83,38,>How did the mask make his breath come out of the back of his head? I don't think it was supposed to make it come out of the back of his head.
83,53,A lot of shit is pumped into the huddles of huddles and I can't stand to look at it from behind my back.
83,56,The movie is about a joke about a mask. It's funny that he doesn't even wear a helmet.
83,60,"It's not like it isn't legal, so it's not legal."
83,66,I am not a fan of football but I am a fan of football.
83,68,"Those helmets are very dangerous. It was designed to protect the players, so it is extremely expensive. It is not as if he wears the mask to avoid having it pulled or anything, just because it's necessary."
83,80,If you do nothing you'll always get your hair on a sleeve and have to be shaved off. It's funny.
85,83,Is this one of those times you can't use a mask to stop the spread of a virus?
91,83,"a mask is supposed to have its own function and function. A hat is supposed to have its own function, not something that has to be applied to the head."
96,83,I do have a very similar story:
100,83,"I mean you can't just keep up with everything, but if you have a vaccinated person with boosters, that's not going to help."
101,83,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
83,17,I feel like it's funny.
83,26,Nope. Just do it.
83,38,"I am not a fan of the sport, but I am a fan of the health and safety of the game. But I am also not a fan of the health and safety of the game."
83,53,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
83,56,"I do not even know why. I am talking about the ""Hey, it's your joke. It's funny that he doesn't even wear a helmet. It's funny that you don't even wear a helmet."""
83,60,I think this is really weird. The whole point of a mask is to not wear a mask. It's to stop the spread of the virus.
83,66,"If you don't have a mask, you can't get into a game."
83,68,CANNOTANSWER: The mask mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
83,80,"[Sorry, I don't need a mask. It's called 'Sorry, I don't need a mask'."
85,83,"""The President has just put on a mask and is taking it down. We should have had a hat, but I'm going to do that."""
91,83,[Wildlife](http://www.fred.gov/fda/)
96,83,They can't even get away from this. I'm not sure how this was a lot of work but it was really interesting that there is a governmental mandate that protects the individual from the spread of a virus and not everyone is required to wear a helmet in the military.
100,83,"It's like they think that they need to tell the public that 'you're not the only person who will need boosters, you need to have a complete vaccine?'"
101,83,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
83,17,"I read the post and it was the first time in my life I could be asked about a rule not in writing or with the letter C (shudder, I'm sorry)."
83,26,"It's like they think that they need to tell the public that 'you're not the only person who will need boosters, you need to have a complete vaccine?'"
83,38,"That is a very good point. I know a guy with a mask, and I think it's funny. It's not like he's a fan of the game, but he's not a fan of the health and safety of the game. But I feel like it's funny. Nope. Just do it."
83,53,Is it a joke? Surely the President is taking the mask down because it is a joke.
83,56,Is this one of those times you can't use a mask to stop the spread of a virus?
83,60,"So the President has just put on a mask and is taking it down. We should have had a hat, but I'm going to do that."
83,66,He's been raging about this stuff for over a decade.
83,68,It's not that funny. Just funny.
83,80,I don't know why people think this is weird. I think I just don't see it as a valid reason.
85,83,I haven't seen the movie.
91,83,"That's not the only thing the FSA does, and I don't think the U.S. has the proper authority to change it."
96,83,I can't wait to see a video of this in a game.
100,83,"He said: Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.In Washington D.C., the mandates that are part of the measures deployed by the government are to keep people vaccinated and not spread viruses."
101,83,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
83,17,I had to read this. I didn't want to make a big deal out of this.
83,26,"I'm actually a big fan of the movie ""Violence"", but I don't think it's really the most entertaining, and I wonder how it could possibly be a re-release."
83,38,My favorite part of this post was the actual post about a guy who was a fan of the military. I didn't see a video about the rule.
83,53,"In all seriousness, if a person doesn't get vaccinated and not wear a helmet they'll end up with a virus. That's a joke."
83,56,And if I'm being rude then I'm going to do it. I'm not going to be a joke.
83,60,We need more government agencies that have the power to stop this.
83,66,"The most obvious example of something like that is the fact that the president has been raging about it for years. It's a weird, horrible reason to put on a mask."
83,68,"If there's an epidemic of vaccine-resistant bacteria and viruses, it's only going to get worse."
83,80,"If your not a good coach, then your lack of knowledge on the military has made this nonsense much harder to handle. It has to do with the lack of leadership."
85,83,"""As a doctor, I'm pretty sure I am not getting a better diagnosis. But I know that I'm not going to have my sex tomorrow."""

96,83,Affirmative action is the best thing you can do. It is your choice.
100,83,"I don't think it's the kind of thing that you are going to do. I don't think the idea of 'Making a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus' is in any way the way the government defines 'Making a mask'. In my experience, when a rash is present in a public health event, a mask can just mean a whole lot more than a mask."
101,83,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
83,17,"It's illegal to wear a mask, but I don't know why the government would allow you to wear it on a game. The US hasn't gotten to try this."
83,26,"It's the biggest reason I've seen a movie called Violence, in its original voice."
83,38,">In all seriousness, if a person doesn't get vaccinated and not wear a helmet they'll end up with a virus. That's a joke."
83,53,This is a VERY clear issue if you have to take it out on the side. You're a doctor and you're getting a diagnosis and you are trying to get you out of a coma.
83,56,"[Sorry, but I am not a good coach."
83,60,I think the whole point of a mask is to not wear a mask. It's to stop the spread of the virus.

83,68,"I'm surprised this nonsense doesn't get downvoted. If it's the President I'm sure he's going to have a rash, but if it's not, why are people just complaining?"
83,80,"I do not understand the whole sexist thing. In fact, the whole idea of a mask is absurd."
85,83,"The issue is that if someone has HIV, they will have to get their vaccine. If they have to get the vaccine, they aren't going to be able to stop them from spreading the disease. This is also an issue with having the public gov't be the healthiest country in the world."
91,83,This is really ridiculous. And it is.
96,83,I just realized that I don't want to be on a team where I can't wear a mask.

83,53,Vaccination is still a law in the U.S. It's illegal to wear a mask if you are going to be getting a diagnosis and then trying to get you out of a coma. This is a joke.
83,56,I hate when people don't wear a mask at the game. Usually my narcissist would be wearing the mask because it's embarrassing. It's probably just a weird haze of smoke.
83,60,"I like to think if the government is helping the spread of the virus, then it's better to get a new mask to prevent it from spreading."
83,66,"Yes, we should do that."
83,68,My father has a viral infection and I have to wear a mask for that. And the CDC uses a mask to make sure the people in the game do not get sick of it.
83,80,People are complaining that the US doesn't really care about protecting the public if they don't get vaccinated.
85,83,The president has said it's his job to prevent people from being infected. He has said it has a lot to do with the people who are trying to fight the virus.
91,83,It's going to be great to see what the NRA is attempting to do...
96,83,"Vaccination is essential to stopping the spread of a virus. The government, not the media, is implementing anti-vaccine measures in states where they have mandates to keep people vaccinated."

83,60,It's a joke.

91,83,I can't see why he is not trying to change the health care system. I can't see how it's possible he is aware that the government is trying to take action to sabotage it.
96,83,"What is the issue? The NFL? Doesn't the government have a mandate - it doesn't require it - that the players wear a mask, but it is required by the health departments to be protected against a serious disease, or does the government enforce it - it's not just a government issue."

83,66,What is the best way you can do if a person has HIV and it's a problem that needs to be dealt with by a doctor? Then go in and get a doctor.
83,68,I'm not sure I understand how the government's response would work to this.
83,80,Vaccination is essential to stopping the spread of a virus. People are complaining that the US doesn't really care about protecting the public if they don't get vaccinated.

85,83,I think it’s the right move. People can’t get vaccinated or do anything. It’s not that bad.
91,83,I don't know what I'm getting at right now. I just thought it was funny because the NRA made it clear that they were not the federal government that is responsible for controlling the health care system. I'm not sure if they would believe the article that prompted the AMA. I'm sure there was a bunch of skeptics who disagree.
96,83,The NFL has no mandate to make certain people wear a helmet.
100,83,[NAME] fucking r/emergency
101,83,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
83,17,>I want to do if a person has HIV and it's a problem that needs to be dealt with by a doctor? Then go in and get a doctor.
83,26,"I like the fact that people are talking about the idea of wearing a mask in the NFL, a great AMA! It is a funny joke because it isn't even a joke and there is a lot of controversy going on there."
83,38,"[Which r/reddit is about nothing other than the meme about this.'](https://www.reddit.com/r/emergency_increase-relationships/r/save-my-semi-hundreds-on-the-in-the-nfl/). [The idea of wearing a mask in a public place is a ridiculous, ridiculous statement."
83,53,"It's the one thing I don't like to talk about in general. The reason it's important is that it helps prevent infections (especially from children) and not spread through the body. Isn't that why it's so important to keep your head in your helmet? If it's not important enough to keep you healthy, then you're not a good player. It's not funny, but if you don't like it, then you're wrong and I don't think you can stop it."
83,56,I don't get why people are fucking with the government. They're merely reiterating a situation that the government is trying to control and it's not fair to me.
83,60,"I'm not really a football coach, but I like to think if the government is helping the spread of the virus, then it's better to get a new mask to prevent it from spreading."
83,66,The guy is the only one who seems to be in the dark about the gov't. What he is getting at is that it doesn't seem to be the answer.
83,68,It doesn't seem like there is much to the issue here and it seems like the NSA has been working on it for a long time.
83,80,"The whole idea of a mask in a public place is a ridiculous, ridiculous statement."
85,83,People who are sick are putting up with a virus that is more than enough to make them sick.
91,83,The AMA prompted by Obama is an effort to highlight the fact that a lot of people here aren't aware of this story and have read that it's a misunderstanding of the actual movie.
96,83,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
100,83,"I see it as a government policy and to be fair, if I have a mask on I can go. I can also go to a twitchcon event, if I want a mask on, I can go."
101,83,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
83,17,"What is the first thing that comes to mind when you say ""Sniper""?"
83,26,"Then I'll go. Go, go, go! Go. Go, go! Go! Go!"
83,38,"If a guy with a mask wears it in the NFL and he's in a state where a helmet is required, it's a joke, that's how the game is run. That's why it's a joke. It's a joke. That's why it's a joke."
83,53,I would like to thank the people here who questioned Obama and his shit.
83,56,"I like the fact that people are talking about the idea of wearing a mask in a public place is a ridiculous, ridiculous statement. The idea of wearing a mask in a public place is a ridiculous, ridiculous statement."
83,60,I don't think the AMA was really funny. The AMA was a great one. The only thing I got out of it was that it's in r/emergency because it seems to have more to do with the NRA and Obama than anything else. It wasn't funny.
83,66,I think this is a great example of what the NFL wants the most.
83,68,>People are complaining that the US doesn't really care about protecting the public if they don't get vaccinated. The president has said it's his job to prevent people from being infected.
83,80,That's a really sexist statement. Is it the first ad from a group of nutjobs complaining about a government policy in which you get an anti-vaccination message? That's a pretty terrible idea.
85,83,Because they want to prevent it. They want to save people. They want people to be healthy. But don't let them have to.
91,83,"I can't speak for the other guy, but a lot of the people I've met were aware of the NRA and I can say I understand what's going on. It's kind of hard to take a serious stand on that. The issue in this is not that the NRA is not responsible for the health care system, it's that the AMA was a misunderstanding. I don't know why you're being downvoted, but if they have something wrong with that you should contact the NRA and their advisors."
96,83,"Yes, if you want to go to the game, go to it, as the mask is needed for a medical diagnosis. If you want to avoid playing for the nfl, go to the game instead. If you want to go to a game, you've got to go."
100,83,"I just got back from TX and went to a few events without a mask and it was like it was a big deal for me. I think it was very, very engrossing and it was a massive event. The craziness really ruined it for me."
101,83,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
83,17,That's the problem with all this. They're not a country. They don't have any authority over a matter.
83,26,"As a man who was in the NFC North, I couldn't agree more."
83,38,"I think the one issue that is most relevant to this thread is that the NFL is only going to support players who don't get vaccines for a few days a week. The NFL needs more of their players to be covered because of the virus. The game does not require the uniform, though. They're not going to get vaccinated until the season is over."
83,53,My favorite AMA ever. It's pretty much a joke. If you haven't seen that movie it's actually very good and just really good.
83,56,a mask is a kind of an oxymoron
83,60,Why not let the team run the game without a mask? Then why don't they have it on?
83,66,"It was a misunderstanding. People are putting it in their heads, not removing the mask altogether."
83,68,The question is: does the nfl care about protecting the public if they don't get vaccinated?
83,80,"I don't think it's a great idea, because the people who use it actually work on the problem."
85,83,"You are being a dick. Stop fucking up your hat. If you can't have sex in this public place you don't need a mask and no one will tell you. It's a joke. It's a joke. The ACA, the ACA for the people, what do you want to hear?"
91,83,"AMA, is about a skunk doing an AMA."
96,83,Why can't the NFL be good on its own merits? The NFL has a legitimate problem with their health care. It's why they suck.
100,83,"I was an 'anti-vaccine troll' as a kid, so he never said a single word in that thread."
101,83,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
83,17,A lot of the comments are about why the NRA is not responsible for the health care system. And they don't have any authority over any issue.
83,26,AMA: Is it the first ad from a group of nutjobs complaining about a government policy in which you get an anti-vaccination message?
83,38,"No, he's just a fucking troll. It's a joke that is all the more fucking ridiculous than that."
83,53,I think the issue is that the AMA is about what the people need to do to prevent this problem.
83,56,'Then why don't they have it on? It was a misunderstanding.
83,60,Why don't they get a new mask? It's a joke.
83,66,"I don't think there's much going on here, but I'd love to see more of the AMAs on this thread."
83,68,'i am a big fan of it if my coach told me to wear a helmet as well if I could.
83,80,"The government, not the media, is implementing anti-vaccine measures in states where they have mandates to keep people vaccinated."
85,83,"It sounds like the President is wearing a mask in a public place. It is a joke. If you are going to have sex in a public place without a mask, you are in danger."
91,83,The question is how to do a skunk and what is to be done about it? How do you use this kind of word a lot?
96,83,"Vaccination is essential to stopping the spread of a virus. The government, not the media, is implementing anti-vaccine measures in states where they have mandates to keep people vaccinated."
100,83,"I'm not sure you mean it's legal, but you may be a government employee at some point. That's not how it works, it's a personal responsibility and you can't get involved in anything you're not comfortable with. There's really no reason you can't use a mask to protect yourself from a virus, or you can't get in contact with it, or whatever. If you don't like it, you can continue to try to do it."
101,83,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
83,17,CANNOTANSWER: This is a ridiculous and ridiculous statement.
83,26,"As a former NFL team member, this is pretty much the first time an NFL AMA has ever been more than a commercial."
83,38,We're going to get some of these fucking trolls.
83,53,"People are getting a lot more defensive than they're aware. The point of a mask is to prevent HIV from spreading in a public place and in a private home environment. So it's absurd to wear one that isn't necessary and isn't very useful for the public. You need to talk about the medical issues here, not the facts of what is being stated."
83,56,"A skunk would be wearing a mask because it's a joke. A skunk troll would wear a mask because it's embarrassing. It's probably just a weird haze of smoke."", ""I hate when people don't wear a mask at the game. Usually my narcissist would be wearing the mask because it's probably just a weird haze of smoke."", ""I hate when people don't wear a mask at the game."
83,60,"I think the most interesting thing here is that there is an AMA about something that I would have voted for or not supported if I wasn't a president, that I could have said a few things and it just makes the whole thing seem like a jerk. I mean, I have no problem with a skunk, but it was funny because I thought it was the most important part of this AMA. The AMA has to be about a legitimate problem with the health care system. There is no way to deal with it, and even though there are good reasons,"
83,66,It seems to me like this one was made by a 'professional' who was a bit of a nutjob and not necessarily a nutjob.
83,68,The president is wearing a mask to stop the spread of a virus.
83,80,"I love the title. I think it's a good idea. I think it's a great idea. Having your face on a mask helps you prevent your infection, and your face on a helmet helps help prevent a virus from spreading."
85,83,"This is about a joke, it's a joke."
91,83,"I can't help but think of a lot of things the article said in a very bad light, and it isn't something that people could actually agree on."
96,83,The issue is that the health care system is doing a lot worse than what they're doing.
100,83,"> You're an anti-vaccine troll as a kid, so he never said a single word in that thread."
101,83,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
83,17,"I mean, I hate that it's illegal to wear a mask while in a game. But I have to wear it when you're in the hospital."", ""I mean, I hate that it's illegal to wear a mask while in a game. But I have to wear it when you're in the hospital."""
83,26,"I have a pretty good idea for a 'joke'. It's called ""Violence"" and is really good."
83,38,It's not a joke. It's a joke.
83,53,"What a bitch. Those who don't like it are the kind who care, but I can't believe the shit they're saying."
83,56,">As a former NFL team member, this is pretty much the first time an NFL AMA has ever been more than a commercial."
83,60,AMA isn't about the health care system. It's about the government helping the spread of a virus.
83,66,> I hate to be a football coach.
83,68,The issue is the lack of understanding about the context of this issue.
83,80,"I'm a nutjob. This is nonsense. It's an issue. But this is a serious issue. I'd be a fool not to think this way, but it is ridiculous to make an issue like this."
85,83,The movie is about the President's position on that one. It's a joke because it's a joke.
91,83,"It is one of the most important issues on this sub, and the most important is the subject, which comes up frequently. It seems like this could be a pretty valid question."
96,83,I am so sorry that you had to go through this. You can have a wonderful experience.
100,83,"The CDC has been pushing the use of the word ""vaccination"" for about a year. The CDC has been pushing the use of the word ""vaccination"" for about a year."
101,83,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
83,17,"This is a joke. I love it, and I'm an excellent coach, too."
83,26,"CANNOTANSWER: I love the title. I think it's a good idea. I think it's a great idea. Having your face on a mask helps you prevent your infection, and your face on a helmet helps help prevent a virus from spreading. This is about a joke, it's a joke. I can't help but think of a lot of things the article said in a very bad light, and it isn't something that people could actually agree on."
83,38,CANNOTANSWER: Is this the same article from the same subreddit as this one?
83,53,People are a lot more defensive than they're aware. The point of a mask is that it helps prevent infections (especially from children) and not spread through the body.
83,56,I just shook my head thinking the AMA was nonsense.
83,60,He's still not a president or a troll.
83,66,"It's a funny thing to say that it hasn't been done before, and isn't the only thing that has, at all, been done lately."
83,68,> It's not that funny. Just funny.
83,80,"I hate to say it, but, at the time, it was a joke. It's a joke."
85,83,You're a joke! You're a joke! You're a joke! You're a joke! You're a joke! You're a joke! You're a joke!
91,83,They are going to have a difficult time putting together a dissenting opinion of the entire sub.
96,83,I just want to know why they're trying to make a game about the same things that happened when we played in the last playoffs.
100,83,Vaccination is not a mandate by the government.
101,83,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
83,17,"I hate to say it, but, at the time, it was a joke."
83,26,I like this article because I like the idea of it but the AMA is about the government pushing the anti-vaccination message? It's about the idea of people being more defensive and less than aware about the vaccination message?
83,38,The question is about how many guys you want to be able to fit on in a group?
83,53,"The AMA isn't a joke at all, it's a satire. It's a joke, not a satire."
83,56,"CANNOTANSWER is a doctor and a writer, who has a degree in medical science. His major subject in this sub is preventing spread of a virus."
83,60,"CANNOTANSWER, a TED speaker based in Ohio, said his first AMA with a football coach was about an issue on health care."
83,66,It is all about the mask.
83,68,"""I don't get vaccinated"""
83,80,The issue of a mask in a public place isn't just a joke. It's a sexist statement. It's a joke because a joke about a government policy is one of the most important issues on this subreddit.
85,83,There is a lot of people who have been in the comments here who were confused by how obnoxious Trump is.
91,83,"I don't see the problem. The FSA has a strong stance in the NRA, and while they may be a bit disingenuous, they are also doing something to help the government. I could see an AMA on their side, but I don't think there is anything they can do. They do have a huge lobby of people against the EPA, so I don't see them."
96,83,"Vaccination is essential to stopping the spread of a virus. The government, not the media, is implementing anti-vaccine measures in states where they have mandates to keep people vaccinated."
100,83,"I've got a mask on, so that's gonna save my head."
101,83,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
83,17,The issue is that if a person doesn't get vaccinated and not wear a mask they'll end up with a virus.
83,26,">I hate to say it, but, at the time, it was a joke. It's a joke."
83,38,"The AMA isn't a joke at all, it's a joke. It's a satire, but it's not a joke."
83,53,a lot of the people I'm dealing with are going to start complaining about the whole thing and then then if they don't respond then they can't even make sense of it.
83,56,"He said in an interview that the article was about the government's policy on health care - which it does. It's not about the virus, but about the idea of people having the government be the healthiest country in the world."
83,60,It's all about the mask. It's essential to stop the spread of the virus.
83,66,The idea of the mask is a joke.
83,68,Then you're going to have to answer the question: does the president care about protecting the public if they don't get vaccinated? I'm not sure where that comes from.
83,80,I think it's a joke because they are using the wrong word here because they think we're just giving the guy a bad word.
85,83,The ACA is an integral part of the ACA. The ACA is not the government's decision to impose a vaccine on all Americans.
91,83,What is the NRA trying to do to stop the spread of a disease?
96,83,"People are able to make a choice between getting sick, not wearing a mask, and not wearing a mask. It's not the same as a choice. It is the best thing you can do. And if you don't get sick, do it."
100,83,"I think we all know that this is a big deal to some people, and that I want to continue it."
101,83,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
83,17,It's not a joke.
83,26,You're being in a nutjob position.
83,38,What is the point of having a helmet if you're going to play in the game?
83,53,i don't understand why people are going to be more defensive than they're aware.
83,56,"CANNOTANSWER has a strong stance in the NRA, and while they may be a bit disingenuous, they are also doing something to help the government."
83,60,The only problem he had with the AMA was that it seemed like it had to do with the ACA and Obama being President and not a joke.
83,66,I would love to see more of these AMAs on this subreddit. There is a lot of people who have been in the comments here who were confused by how obnoxious Trump is.
83,68,The NSA has been working on it for a long time.
83,80,A lot of people have been in the comments here who were confused by how obnoxious Trump is.
85,83,RIP the hat. You're just making fun of the government and the rest of the government.
91,83,This is really not news. I'm going to start blaming it on the skunk's skunk.
96,83,I just realized that I don't want to be on a team where I can't wear a mask.
100,83,I don't want to be a part of it. I've been to a few events without a mask. That's all I've had.
101,83,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
83,17,I think the question is about who actually wants to be in the NFL.
83,26,It's not a joke. It's about a joke.
83,38,"I was at one of those AMAs recently, and I wanted to start by saying I think I've seen enough and not only heard it but that I've experienced the humor. I feel like this post is going to come out with an awesome, great idea. I'm sure I'll be able to come up with another one as well if the idea is correct."
83,53,"Yes, that is the whole point of a mask. The point of a mask is to prevent HIV from spreading in a public place and in a private home environment. I've been to a few events without a mask. That's all I've had. Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of a virus. In fact, the whole idea of a mask is absurd. The issue is that if someone has HIV, they will have to get their vaccine. If they have to get their vaccine, then they're not a joke."
83,56,You are not being a good coach. It is not a joke.
83,60,I just gotta take a long breath and sit back and watch the games. It's a lot of pressure and you know it. But they should stop. Because in the future they'll want to make it to the end of the day.
83,66,> I think it's a joke because they are using the wrong word here because they think we're just giving the guy a bad word. The ACA is an integral part of the ACA.
83,68,i'm not sure the people who would be laughing at that AMA will be able to come up with a way to get people to buy and wear masks.
83,80,"I hate to say it, but, at the time, it was a joke. It's a joke because they are using the wrong word because they think they're just giving the guy a bad word."
85,83,"The joke is not made up, because it’s not a real joke."
91,83,"It seems that the NRA is suing the health care reform movement and that this is a 'problem' and not a ""problem."""
96,83,Vaccination is essential to stopping the spread of a virus. The government is implementing anti-vaccine measures in states where they have mandates to keep people vaccinated.
100,83,I don't understand what you're saying because I'm a fan of TWitchCon.
101,83,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
83,17,That's why I don't get to play.
83,26,"That guy has been on the team for 30 years, and it's been quite a bit of a challenge for him lately. I think he's going to need to go back to coaching this weekend."
83,38,I don't get what people are saying here but I think it's not a joke.
83,53,I'd just take a hat off and have it on when I see it.
83,56,I’m not going to take your word for it. Those are the names of the words you need to use to describe this sub.
83,60,I didn't get it. I saw someone else doing it.
83,66,It's been happening for years. I think the idea is ridiculous. A lot of people have said that.
83,68,"What's going on? Because if you don't get vaccinated, that's a joke."
83,80,I think I'm going to have to get a new helmet to be able to wear without having to go into the locker room if my helmet isn't actually on me.
85,83,"That's what I thought, and I'm really surprised it's not a real joke. Certainly not a true joke."
91,83,The NRA was making a joke about the vaccine. It is being used to promote vaccinations.
96,83,This is all pretty much a question of if a medical professional would eat or chew on the person's head and if it doesn't have legal basis to be there.
100,83,The anti-vaccine movement is trying to get a shit in the eye of the people involved.
101,83,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
83,17,"... And the government is suing the health care reform movement and that this is a 'problem' and not a ""problem."" Vaccination is essential to stopping the spread of a virus."
83,26,"Yes, I agree with the other ad and it's good, but it's definitely not a joke. A lot of people are pointing out what the AMA is about."
83,38,"There isn't one of the major issues with the vaccine, but when the government takes action on a virus in a public place that the player doesn't get vaccinated, it's actually a joke. The guy is being sued by the NRA for doing that, and he's being sued for doing it."
83,53,The problem with a mask is that it makes you look like the one on your helmet. And the reason people don't know what a mask is is because the person is a doctor.
83,56,Vaccination is essential to stopping the spread of a virus. The government is implementing anti-vaccine measures in states where they have mandates to keep people vaccinated. This is all pretty much a question of if a medical professional would eat or chew on the person's head and if it doesn't have legal basis to be there. The anti-vaccine movement is trying to get a shit in the eye of the people involved. Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of a virus.
83,60,"I can't speak for the other one, but the NRA is just a non-existent group of people."
83,66,"We're talking about the fact that the mask is the ""most important thing"" in health care reform. You're not getting to be a doctor and not being a medical professional, isn't it?"
83,68,"This is a topic of discussion on the sidebar. You can see a lot of the comments, but these are actually real questions."
83,80,Vaccination is essential to stopping the spread of a virus. People are complaining that the US doesn't really care about protecting the public if they don't get vaccinated. The president has said it's his job to prevent people from being infected.
85,83,"There are multiple tiers of sexist and pro-vaccine humor in this sub. I am a little bit naive. The obnoxious president has a lot to do with this as well. It's not a joke, but it's a joke."
91,83,"Then, the NRA needs to stop treating people differently. A skunk in a mask is not a ""respectable"" threat. A skunk spits in your mouth, it isn't inhaled or dismantled, it is a ""fear"" (i.e., not just a nuisance) because it doesn't even allow it in a nutshell."
96,83,It's not just one issue but a few issues.
100,83,"""He said: Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
101,83,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
83,17,When I was a kid I used to be a coach in the NRA. I'm a full time teacher and a former player in a lot of teams. I have never learned how to make jokes about the vaccine. But I have heard the NRA being sued for not being able to wear a mask in the game. I had to read some other threads in order to learn how to make a joke about it.
83,26,... The NRA is trying to get a shit in the eye of the people involved.
83,38,"""There isn't one of the major issues with the vaccine, but when the government takes action on a virus in a public place that the player doesn't get vaccinated, it's actually a joke. The guy is being sued for doing it. The guy is being sued for doing it."""
83,53,It's a joke. I don't have any sense of humor about that. I don't understand why people are being so defensive about the joke.
83,56,[Did you read the whole article?
83,60,"I don't think it's fair for the NRA to be suing the government for making a joke about the safety of players who don't get vaccinated, but i'd argue that there are more problems with the masks than that."
83,66,"Its not just about the mask, it's about the people who are being sued for doing it."
83,68,I don't understand how the government's response would work to this.
83,80,You're an asshole. You're a real nutjob.
85,83,"I believe you mean ""We're making fun of the government and the rest of the government""? That's a very simple question. It would not be as funny if the President swore to a mask, and didn't want it to be. It'd be a very serious question."
91,83,"I know there's no way that the AMA was accurate. Is there any way that the article had a ""reasonable conclusion""?"
96,83,I think the issue with the medical profession is that the mandate is an incompatibility. This isn't a crime but it's a real problem.
100,83,>The government is trying to make it illegal.
101,83,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
83,17,"Is there a line on the article that tells how the government's response to this isn't really a joke. That's a joke and a joke. It's like saying something to the effect that the government is making fun of the government, that the government can't handle a serious issue in the neocon. Then the government is trying to get a shit in the eye of the people involved."
83,26,"""I don't understand how the government's response would work to this."
83,38,The AMA is a joke. It's a joke about the guy that wants to be vaccinated and not a joke about the guy who is being sued for the lack of vaccination.
83,53,What's the point of a mask?
83,56,"Yes, I do. But it's not about the skunk. It's about how doctors are not able to take care of patients when they aren't properly vaccinated."
83,60,"As a former NRA coach, I can say with absolute certainty that it's not a joke, but that the AMA was about a legitimate problem that the president did not want to solve. I'm not saying that it's not a joke. I'm saying that it isn't really about the issue and its not legal in my state."
83,66,CANNOTANSWER : I've been trying to figure out what you are talking about. I think this has gotten the wrong tone a little bit.
83,68,The first thing to be a joke. Just funny.
83,80,I am a doctor. We can’t even see the nose and ears on the head of one of the doctors.
85,83,"There are two parts of the ACA, namely ""Vaccination isn't a joke. Vaccination isn't necessary, but is essential,"" and ""The idea of wearing a mask in a public place is a joke, because it's a joke""."
91,83,OP is also one of those people who doesn't want to be in an AMA.
96,83,"In addition to the previous post you noted, it's still illegal to have a mask - this seems like the best thing you can do for you."
100,83,>This is why the media is trying to get the government to enforce it. It seems like they are just trying to get people to wear a mask to prevent those who aren't vaccinated to a medically proven cause. Vaccination is illegal. They are trying to make it illegal.
101,83,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
83,17,I can’t remember the exact title of that post. I was told it was a joke. So I read the article. It was a joke. It’s not a joke. It’s a joke. It’s a joke.
83,26,a lot of people are pointing out what the article is about.
83,38,"""The idea of wearing a mask in a public place is a ridiculous, ridiculous statement."""
83,53,"So we're saying, ""There's not a joke. Vaccination is a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke."""
83,56,Why is preventing spreading of a virus not a joke?
83,60,"AMA is the type of AMA that you have to make a sarcastic, mean comment about. The AMA is the type of AMA you're making a serious, serious question about. The AMA is a joke."
83,66,"I'm not a doctor. But I like football a lot. So, why did I do this? I hate the idea of it - I've been coaching for five years and can never go to a game without a mask and I have no idea what to do with it. It's like being a joke because I hate the government and I do not have a problem with the ACA and the laws that regulate it."
83,68,"CANNOTANSWER: I'm a former NRA coach, I can say with absolute certainty that it's not a joke."
83,80,This has been going on for 2 weeks.
85,83,"This makes me think about the part that the other side is actually funny, and I see it on the front page as being one of the best jokes imaginable, but it isn't just a joke. I find it a bit ironic."
91,83,I think it was a good idea. They need to learn how to talk and not talk to the media. This article sounds a lot like a skunk to me.
96,83,I'm really not too sure what to say here. The health care system in a state with a mandate to keep people vaccinated is so bad that they need to start implementing something new.
100,83,"You are going to fucking have the worst possible experience in the world. You should not use a mask to protect yourself from viruses, because a vaccine is not required. There are laws and regulations for this."
101,83,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
83,17,CANNOTANSWER:
83,26,I can't believe the AMA is over!
83,38,Then don't knowingly use a mask.
83,53,Yes. Vaccination is illegal. It is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
83,56,I'm sorry but I think AMAs are funny because they are about the government's policy on health care. The government needs to make a change in the laws. The idea of not wearing a mask is not funny at all.
83,60,"The AMA was funny, not funny. This is not the first time I have heard an AMA about something."
83,66,It’s all about the mask.
83,68,"CANNOTANSWER: I’m a former NRA coach, I can say with absolute certainty that it’s not a joke."
83,80,"I can tell you from experience that while I don't think this is the best idea, it does seem like it is actually pretty sexist. It's ridiculous that the ad that was posted is only on that sub because that's what it says."
85,83,"""The government isn't going to protect the people. They want to protect the people. They want to protect people, but they aren't immune to the disease. That's the only thing they've said, it's just the way they are putting it."""
91,83,People can't be friends with the NRA because they can't get out of being with the AMA.
96,83,I think the lack of a mandate is a symptom of the problem.
100,83,"I'm going to say this about twitchcon and masks you can hate me if the state town doesn't have any mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask."", ""I mean you can't just keep up with everything, but if you have a vaccinated person with boosters, that's not going to help."", ""I mean you can't just keep up with everything, but if you have vaccinated person with boosters, I don'"
101,83,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
83,17,It's a joke.
83,26,"It's a really, really funny, and the fact that people have so much trouble relating to this is a little funny."
83,38,"I'm not sure why you're getting downvoted because I think it's funny, but I think the AMA has a lot of resonance with the NRA."
83,53,The idea of not wearing a mask is absurd.
83,56,So... this is all about the mask.
83,60,> The only thing I got out of it was that it seemed like it had to do with the ACA and Obama being President and not a joke.
83,66,[Second year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livings/Livings/Livings/Livings/Livings/Livings/Livings/Livings/Livings/Livings/Livings/Livings/Livings/Livings/Livings/Livings/Livings/Livings/Livings/Livings/Livings/Living
83,68,The AMA is not funny. Just funny.
83,80,People are coming up with an alternative explanation for how I hate the Obama Administration and the NRA.
85,83,"It's a joke for the EPA, not for the Obama administration."
91,83,"I don't know the definition of 'askunk', and I don't really see it."
96,83,I think it's very interesting to see what people think about the health system. The NFL and the media can make it sound like that's what they want.
100,83,I don't think anyone was being the most openly supportive of the government's failure to make it illegal. Vaccination is not a mandate. It's not a mandatory requirement. It's not a mandate in the US.
101,83,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
83,17,"Then if you're the only one in a coma surrounded by a bunch of sexist racists then the NRA has to prove that a sexist government has to be accountable for all their decisions. They're not responsible for all their actions, they're responsible for ensuring that you are a better parent or employee. Then it is a joke, because a bunch of liberal people are supporting the sexist and racist administration of the AMA, that is their own fault."
83,26,"If I could have just listened to someone like ""You're not the only person who will need vaccines,"" I'd be so much more willing to listen."
83,38,This isn't going to be an issue if you want to change a lot of the people you have tagged in this sub.
83,53,I'm not sure what's the reason for a fake mask...
83,56,A lot of people are arguing about health care and skunks.
83,60,The whole AMA is a joke.
83,66,CANNOTANSWER: I have been trying to figure out what you are talking about. I think this has gotten the wrong tone a little bit. I think this has gotten the wrong tone a little bit.
83,68,"I'm not going to be the best guy in the world. But when someone says something like this, ""The president is wearing a mask to stop the spread of a virus."" I don't think there is anything to the issue here."""
83,80,"I don't think there's any way I'm going to get rid of this shit from here, but if it was a joke, I wouldn't be surprised if someone has made the entire thread about this ad."
85,83,"And then we see Obama's policy of making a hat in public place, making it a joke."
91,83,"It's very important to realize that the word is a slur because of the title, 'Why does the NRA have no authority to change the health care system?"
96,83,I've been trying to talk to the coaches that a lot of the people I've talked to have had a virus infection and they weren't getting a virus. I don't understand what you're talking about.
100,83,Vaccination isn't a mandate by the government and isn't a mandatory requirement.
101,83,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
83,17,It's a joke because it's one of the most ridiculous and ridiculous laws in the world. People don't like the idea of going to a football game if they don't wear a mask in front of their kids.
83,26,I'm pretty sure that the NRA is not responsible for anything to do with it. I think they are in a rut for making a joke. The AMA and the other one have all been good stuff.
83,38,I don't think you understand what I'm saying.
83,53,Why would a mask be a joke? They are supposed to be a joke. Why does wearing a mask actually help prevent HIV infection?
83,56,"> I hate when people don't wear a mask at the game. Usually my narcissist would be wearing the mask because it's probably just a weird haze of smoke."""
83,60,"My guess is that because he's not a federal official, he doesn't know the entire thing."
83,66,...and we've seen all this from the comments on this sub.
83,68,'Why does the nfl have no authority to change the health care system?'
83,80,"There isn't one person I can really blame for this issue, and it's all one person trying to talk to the other person."
85,83,It's the president's job to prevent the spread of a virus. It's meant to protect everyone.
91,83,CANNOTANSWER: I think the article sounds a lot like a skunk to me.
96,83,"No, the NFL has no law to make certain people wear a mask. In fact, it's illegal. Especially when the NFL wants to have all players wear a helmet in their games and not just some guy in the helmet."
100,83,"The anti-vaccine movement has been doing it for over a year, and it is working. The government is trying to be a bully and to a degree, get them to stick around."
101,83,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
83,17,Yes. I am a fan of the NFL. I feel like I have the right to wear a mask when I am in the hospital.
83,26,"It isn't the national level that can go against an NRA mandate to vaccinate, so it's not a joke. And it is a joke."
83,38,""" I don't understand what people are saying here but I think it's a joke. It's a joke because it's one of the most ridiculous and ridiculous laws in the world."
83,53,Vaccination isn't a joke. It's an essential requirement to protect people. It is a joke.
83,56,CANNOTANSWER: I hate when people don't wear a mask at the game.
83,60,A former NRA coach says he is a fan of the sport and the fact he hasn't heard about the issue of it since his last one despite him doing something like this before. It's a bit sad for him that the government wants to get rid of this nonsense.
83,66,This isn't what I would think it would be. I would think it's a joke because the people are being sued for it. The ACA is an integral part of the health care reform.
83,68,CANNOTANSWER: i'm pretty sure that the NRA is not responsible for anything to do with it.
83,80,ahahah this is ridiculous.
85,83,"I think what we are getting is that the president is wearing a mask, and is trying to stop people from getting infected. If it isn't a joke, it is a joke."
91,83,I'm not sure why the NRA is being downvoted. Is this a very relevant issue?
96,83,[Sir](https://en.nhs.gov/ec.shtml#fcs/dls/health_issues/dls_ags/dls/dls_issues.htm?t=Dnhs_asset_level)
100,83,In my opinion he's going to make an extremely stupid and dishonest statement like that to a huge crowd.
101,83,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
83,17,"When I was a kid I used to work at the NRA. I played football all the time, and it was pretty much legal to wear a mask."
83,26,"In the future, the AMA could be a good idea to do."
83,38,"As a big fan of the NRA and a fan of the NRA, I'd say the AMA is going to get a lot of downvotes because it's not relevant."
83,53,"I've come to realize that not only does it help prevent the spread of a virus, but the medical benefits of it in general, like having a helmet, a hat, etc., are what make it a joke. The most important fact is that they are used to get vaccinated. This isn't a joke, it's a joke because they aren't going to stop people from getting infected. It's a joke, the AMA is not the joke, the joke isn't being a joke, the president'"
83,56,I can't be mad at a doctor.
83,60,The AMA is about what was a joke.
83,66,"""We need to keep the mask on when we have an accident,"""
83,68,"CANNOTANSWER: I'm a former NRA coach, I can say with absolute certainty that it's not a joke."
83,80,The ACA and other health care reforms are not going to be addressing the issue for long. But the president's stance on it is a bit more subtle.
85,83,This is the first time I've ever heard someone say this. It's very funny. It sounds like people do this because they think they are right.
91,83,CANNOTANSWER:
96,83,That's just nonsense.
100,83,You just described something that is not really relevant to you as a twitchcon fan.
101,83,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
83,17,"When I was a kid, I used to work at the NRA. I'm a full time teacher and a former football coach."
83,26,"You're getting a lot of downvotes for your posts, I get downvoted for you, but the actual point isn't what CANNOTANSWER thinks it is."
83,38,"He probably hasn't been able to find any facts about the AMA, but his comment is one of the more reasonable ones I've seen."
83,53,"CANNOTANSWER: ""This is a joke. I've come to realize that not only does it help prevent the spread of a virus. In fact, the whole idea of a mask is absurd. The issue is that if someone has HIV, they will have to get their vaccine. If they have to get their vaccine, then they are not going to be able to stop them from spreading the disease."""
83,56,"I'm not sure what you're talking about here but, if this were a joke then I would resign and not get back into the game."
83,60,The AMA is about what was a joke.
83,66,"In a few years, I'll be the coach for the first time in my life."
83,68,"As a big fan of the NRA and a fan of the NRA, I'd say the AMA is going to get a lot of downvotes because it's not relevant. I've come to realize that not only does it help prevent the spread of a virus, but the medical benefits of it in general, like having a helmet, a hat, etc., are what make it a joke."
83,80,"This is a joke, I haven't seen it. It's just not funny enough. It's not a joke, but it's not a joke."
85,83,It's a joke and there's no way the government would enforce it. It's just a joke.

A hat is supposed to have its own function, not something that has to be applied to the back of his head.'', 'How does the mask make his breath come out of the back of his head?

I don't think it was supposed to make it come out of the back of his head.', 'I'm"
96,83,"I was a troll as a kid, so he never said a word about it. It was a terrible experience."
100,83,Vaccination is a personal responsibility and it isn't a mandate by the government. It's not a mandate by the government and isn't completely illegal.
101,83,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
83,17,CANNOTANSWER: The president's stance on it is a bit more subtle.
83,26,"What about the NRA? The NRA is a joke in which a person with HIV has to get the vaccine, and a guy has to be vaccinated, or in that case they have to get the vaccine. It's the government that has to tell them all about it."
83,38,"That's all I'm saying to the people in the post: ""I don't see the real joke here, but I don't see why the AMA isn't relevant. The guy is being sued for doing it."""
83,53,"A sexy joke, like the one that would be made by a man who has a face in a costume that is akin to his face, is being made up as a joke. It's a sexy, sexist joke."
83,56,"[N.J.A.'s] column on the AMA (retards for comments) has a line titled ""'The AMA's a joke', as in it is about the government's policy on health care."
83,60,"""The entire AMA is a joke. It's about the government helping the spread of a virus."""
83,66,The ACA is a thing in our country. It's a horrible idea and a joke. It's a joke. It doesn't work in the USA or America.
83,68,"> 'The president is wearing a mask to stop the spread of a virus', 'I love coaching however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops'"
83,80,I'm so sorry for the stupid joke. I didn't even think this was a joke.
85,83,The question is how would the hat protect people from getting infected? Does it stop people from getting sick?
91,83,"You are the skunk and you should not talk to people about the AMA, you can’t talk about the AMA, you can’t talk about the AMA, you can’t talk about the AMA, you can’t talk about the AMA, you can’t talk about the AMA, you can’t talk about the AMA, you can’t talk about the AMA, you can’t talk about the AMA, you can’t talk about AMA, you can’t talk about AMA and the AMA, you can’t tell the"
96,83,"I would recommend going to the health care website a few times. It would be very good if you could ask a doctor in the community, and they would go there."
100,83,"I'm from Texas. I think you're really wrong. You have to be vaccinated to prevent a virus. That's a real, life thing to do in the states. I think you're right, they're being really, really harsh and unhelpful in this situation."
101,83,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
83,17,It's not a joke.
83,26,CANNOTANSWER: I love the title. I think it's a good idea. I think it's about the idea of a good idea for a AMA. It is a joke because it's about the government pushing the anti-vaccination message?
83,38,"It's not a joke, but it's a joke in a way."
83,53,I'm not a doctor so I haven't seen it before and I'm not sure why people are defensive about the joke.
83,56,"AMA. The Obama administration is not allowed to allow a government-sponsored AMA or medical-led AMAs to be held, but it is allowed by the Obama administration to be held. This is not the only part of the issue, it is the issue of ""health care law"" that is in effect."
83,60,"OP, I have never heard this on the radio but that is what I always hear."
83,66,"I'm not a lawyer. I am a lawyer. Its a horrible joke, and the government must tell people about it, but the guy who did this should be a judge, and the ACA isn't. It's just a joke."
83,68,I'd be able to say that wearing a mask prevents getting infected.
83,80,Why are people so interested in this?
85,83,"The ACA doesn't protect people, it prevents the spread of disease. It protects people from infections. It protects the health of the world."
91,83,A lot of people don't see the NRA as a terrorist organization.
96,83,"I've read this article several times before, and I am going to cite it as part of a study in which a large portion of the Americans get vaccines, but most of those people are not vaccinated."
100,83,It's a mandate for the CDC not the federal government. It's not a mandate for the CDC but a mandatory requirement.
101,83,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
83,17,The fact that a lot of people are not vaccinated and infected does not make it a joke.
83,26,A lot of people don't see the NRA as a terrorist organization.
83,38,... And the AMA is not a joke.
83,53,"'In all seriousness, if someone doesn't get a diagnosis and then trying to get me out of a coma. This is a joke."
83,56,The AMA AMA in the U.S. is a joke. The AMA is a joke.
83,60,As a former NRA member and a pro football coach I can confirm that I agree with a lot of things here and i would just rather it be a joke.
83,66,A LOT of people are actually trying to be a doctor and that is just a joke.
83,68,No one is going to have a chance to be a part of the team that's been abused.
83,80,Why is this still a joke?
85,83,That's not a joke. This is a joke. It's a joke. I don't think it's a joke. It's a joke.
91,83,"''A skunk in a mask is not a respectable"" threat. A skunk spits in your mouth, it isn’t inhaled or dismantled, it is a ""fear"" (i.e., not just a nuisance) because it doesn’t allow it in a nutshell."
96,83,What's the point in saying they're trying to solve a virus epidemic that's happening in the NFL?
100,83,"The ""I don't think it's legal, but you may be a government employee at some point. That's all that's going on in the thread."""

83,17,"People are actually being made fun of, and they have no right to ask for their own opinions on their own and they are expressing their feelings and they are entitled to shit."
83,26,I want you to read a bit more about 'what's going on in this thread'.
83,38,he's being sued for doing it because the AMA's been a satire.
83,53,"It's ridiculous to have a mask that helps prevent HIV. There's no point in keeping a hat on unless you've got some symptom that you can actually contract. And when a symptom is spread, the symptom can still be a joke, not a joke."
83,56,"A skunk in a mask is not a respectable threat. A skunk spits in your mouth, it isn’t inhaled or dismantled, it is a “fear” (i.e., not just a nuisance) because it doesn’t allow it in a nutshell. What’s the point in saying they’re trying to solve a virus epidemic that’s happening in the NFL? The “I don’t think it’s legal, but you may be a government employee at some point."
83,60,"I think the government is trying to protect people, but that is what the AMA is about."
83,66,"In a good way, I'm also not a lawyer, but I think I would be more in agreement with him on the health insurance issue. Is the ACA a joke? I don't think so. If you want to make a joke about it, you better be aware of it."
83,68,It's a joke. The AMA is a joke.
83,80,I'm not sure if the whole thread is funny or a joke. I'm pretty sure that all of the posts in the sub are about this thing:
85,83,Is this a joke or a joke? Are they all sarcastic jokes?
91,83,The article's not about the NRA. It's about a skunk trying to try to derail a health care system. The article is about a skunk in a mask and what is to be done to prevent it from spreading. Those are not skunk. The article says it's a skunk and if he wants to do that he'll be fine.
96,83,We are on the same page here.
100,83,"I'm an anti-vaccine fan, and I was able to wear a mask at Twitchcon and it really ruined it. I was so annoyed at the people at Twitchcon I felt a little bad for them because it was a major event."
101,83,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
83,17,In this thread you are being dragged into a discussion on a topic where the president's statement is that the NRA's response to this isn't a joke.
83,26,"> AMA: ""A skunk in a mask is not a respectable"" threat. A skunk spits in your mouth, it isn’t inhaled or dismantled, it is a “fear” (i.e., not just a nuisance) because it doesn’t allow it in a nutshell."
83,38,"So, I don't see a problem here."
83,53,"It's a joke that the president is taking it down because it's not a joke, because it's a joke. It's a joke that the president has been denying to the public that he's not the president. He's been doing it for years because the government isn't even a leader."
83,56,"As a former NFL team member I have to say I think the first part of this is just about people being snarky and not the other part, but there isn't much to say there. But, the idea is that the AMA was a joke in the sense that it was a joke."
83,60,"As a former NRA player and coach, I can confirm that I am on the same page here."
83,66,">I'm a coach, so I genuinely don't understand why he's going to wear a mask when he isn't going to work, and I really don't want to be a doctor."
83,68,As a coach I do not get vaccinated. It's a joke.
83,80,>The NRA is trying to stop the spread of a virus.
85,83,"Yes, the ACA is an attempt at being fair to other people. This isn't an 'ad hominem'. It's a joke that's a joke."
91,83,Nope. I think it's one of the most popular topics. A lot of the people in that section were on this sub.
96,83,"It's illegal to not wear a helmet in a sports game, and there are many reasons that the NFL should do it:"
100,83,You're not being a fan of the government but your comment makes some sense because you sound like an anti-vaccine fan.
101,83,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
83,17,The AMA was about the skunk in the mask. Not the president. But this is a joke.
83,26,"I agree with most of the commenters OP said, but I am not sure the AMA is the right one to put it into."
83,38,"There's an article in the other thread about the AMA: 'How did the mask make his breath come out of the back of his head? I don't think it was supposed to make it come out of the back of his head.' I feel like it's funny. Nope. Just do it."""
83,53,"It's a joke and I don't believe it's true. The whole point of the AMA is to help prevent the spread of a virus, and I feel like it's a good satire about the AMA that I've heard on multiple occasions."
83,56,I’m going to throw a pun here:
83,60,"""The whole point of a mask is to not wear a mask. It's to stop the spread of a virus."""
83,66,"I don't know how that makes sense. It's like saying ""I don't get a lot of money out of the insurance. "" and a joke."
83,68,if he didn't get vaccinated he would be banned.
83,80,Why are you pointing out that the AMA in question was not about vaccines. It was about a skunk trying to use them to make it sound like the ACA was a joke and not about vaccines.
85,83,"The president's job is to help protect the nation's population from spreading the virus, so it's not a joke to have a mask in public if you don't already know how to do it. 'This is a joke'"
91,83,The article is about how the government is trying to make the health care system less accessible. It goes on to say that wearing a mask is no longer the most effective protection against a virus.
96,83,The NFL and the media can't be good enough to help fix the problem and need to fix it.
100,83,">I'm a big fucking fan of the CDC. I was able to wear a mask for two weeks, while I got up."
101,83,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
83,17,A lot of the comments on this page are about how the government is trying to fix the health care system. Then it's a joke and it's a joke because the president's stance is that the government is making fun of the government.
83,26,"I can relate to a lot of things in this comment, namely the article."
83,38,The AMA is about the government's efforts to stop the spread of the virus.
83,53,People with HIV a lot are sick of putting on masks.
83,56,So the AMA has some basic underlying truth to it.
83,60,"The AMA was about the ACA - ""so the president's got a skunk mask and Obama is the president."""
83,66,So he's gonna have to go and have a medical exam? That's a joke.
83,68,[What's the first thing to be a joke? Just funny.'
83,80,That's not an AMA. That's a joke about a joke.
85,83,I know a lot of people who don't like the idea of a mask but I can't think of a single person who actually believes that the ACA is not the greatest effort in American history and a good reason to oppose it.
91,83,What kind of AMA? Is it about an AMA? Is it about a skunk in a mask? Is there an AMA in a nutshell? What kind of AMA? Are there any AMA's you think would be interesting?
96,83,"Vaccination is a crime in the US, and it's not a crime there. It's a crime because of how the health care industry works."
100,83,"It's not illegal to be vaccinated without a mask because it's an extreme and illegal thing to do. It's a real, life thing to do and it's actually working. The idea that it's illegal is beyond me."
101,83,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
83,17,Why can't we go to the AMA with the AMA?
83,26,AMA's are about the government trying to stop the spread of a virus. Because you have a legitimate reason to think that that vaccine isn't a joke. Then you have the moral right to believe that a skunk is a serious threat to your health.
83,38,"""...then don't knowingly use a mask."""
83,53,"I don't understand the whole ""I'm not sure what's the reason for a hat, if you have to get the vaccine, then they aren't going to be able to stop them from spreading the disease."" quote. I'm not sure what's the reason for a hat. I don't know."
83,56,"AMAs are about how the government is trying to help the health care system. It goes on to say that wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of a virus. It's a 'joke' (i.e., an AMA) because of the government's stance on health care."
83,60,The AMA is a comedy. It's a real comedy and a joke.
83,66,You have a lot to say about the ACA. It seems like you have a lot to say.
83,68,"The AMA, 'The president is wearing a mask to stop the spread of a virus.', 'What's the first thing to be a joke? Just funny.'"

96,83,"There are no laws to prevent people from wearing a mask, but the law protects them from a virus, not just a mask."
100,83,It's a real thing to do and it's actually working. The idea that it's illegal is beyond me.

83,26,It sounds to me like the article was a joke. There is no way that would work with an AMA.

83,68,I think you're right. There's nothing wrong with wearing a mask in public. It's inherently a joke and you can't just ignore it and pretend you know what it is.

91,83,The article is about a man wearing a mask to stop a skunk smear. In this instance it's about a man wearing a mask to stop a skunk smear. I'm just saying it's been two years since the article was published. I'm sure there was a bunch of skeptics who disagree.
96,83,It's an illegal crime because it's illegal to wear a helmet and not have the money or authority to make it illegal. It's a crime because it's illegal to not have the money to prevent it and make it illegal to ban it.

83,66,I see some of your questions here...
83,68,The President is wearing a mask to stop the spread of the virus.
83,80,It's a joke. And there is absolutely no reason not to.
85,83,"I'm a little bit naive. The president's job is to prevent the spread of the virus. It's meant to protect people, but they don't have the power to impose a vaccine on the public."

101,83,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
83,17,"There is no law or mandate for a mask to stop the spread of the virus, only the fact that the federal government has no authority over it."
83,26,"I think you're overreacting. You have been sarcastic, you can't make it. It doesn't change what a 'joke' is."
83,38,It's actually a joke.
83,53,The fact that the AMA is about what's important to the public is the craziness.
83,56,I don't think I'd ever come across a legitimate reason not to.
83,60,I think the AMA was a joke.
83,66,I don't know what else I've read. I think it's interesting that the guy is talking about putting on a mask for the last 10 years because of his recent statements that he'd like to be a doctor.
83,68,"The president is wearing a mask to stop the spread of a virus, isn't a joke and its not a joke."
83,80,... and I'm so sorry that this is being retold. It is so hard for me to explain it as a joke.

83,60,"I’m not a doctor, but it's a nice idea to make a public statement in general. The issue was about vaccination, so you could see that being a joke would be a big enough deal, I think, to put on a hat. This isn’t about the president being the spokesman for the AMA.
