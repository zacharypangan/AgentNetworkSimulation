I think it's important that the mask is visible in the public, but I also think that it has to be very comfortable. That's why we're allowed to wear hats in public."
55,11,...and I think it makes sense that the US government has an obligation to protect itself and protect others from the government. It's a nebulous situation. The US has an obligation to protect itself and protect others. There are many benefits to wearing a mask.

88,11,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
89,11,I agree with the OP. This is a good question to ask. How are the people in this thread able to see how much the problem is if you don't want to be in a public place?
91,11,What did the article say about this?
92,11,There is a very real and simple answer to a common question. Do you know how to do it?

I think people need to know that people who don't wear masks need to be paid to be on a mask - it's a very expensive thing and you'll probably need a much better - mask than an adult. A petty and unnecessarily small dose of mask will probably help. They have no idea how to get a mask. It's a very important issue. Wearing a mask is a very simple, but remarkably accurate"

43,11,The entire point of an AMA in the first paragraph is that the government is not willing to admit that their behavior is wrong or a good thing. The first paragraph sounds really sexist and insulting to you. I feel like this is a bad idea. They're erecting them for a reason.
48,11,The fact that the government has no mandate for them to do so is a ripoff of what's happened in some of the US's other major governments. I'm guessing there's some overlap.
54,11,"[The movie](http://www.noaaac.gov/wiki/RapCrypt.jpg): The ""U.S. Government"" is trying to tell you to stop wearing a mask, or not.

He is also a degenerate who can eat pizza."

93,11,"I was just in an interview with a doctor who was studying medicine. I would ask if they were saying that they might have a different perspective on the subject than it is in this instance. If so, i'd ask the doctor about the nutjob joke and see if they would tell us. I didn't have any actual knowledge about it but just wanted to try to see if anyone else was trying to make jokes on it."
96,11,You want to call the NFL a drug dealer?
101,11,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
22,11,I feel a lot of people need to know that people who don't wear masks need to be paid to be on a mask. I feel like they should be paid to be on a mask if it is an actual precaution. That's one of the major problems the CDC has with the CDC.
25,11,"As far as the AMA itself, it's not about the government, or anything. It's about the people who are willing to pay money to get in. If someone asks me why they should get in, I'll tell them that there's no chance I'll actually get in. I'm just saying, 'but if you have to wear a mask to protect yourself, you're not going to get in.'"
36,11,"The first one is pretty funny. ""When I first saw the title, I knew exactly what a joke was about. The fact that they are suing you, despite it being a joke."""
38,11,>...I don't want to make fun of the president because it is just a joke. It is a joke.
41,11,It isn't the AMA. The entire article.
43,11,> The entire point of a mask is to not wear it. It's to stop the spread of a virus.
48,11,"If I'm not mistaken, the CDC has a monopoly on what is considered a joke on the market. It is just an issue of the government wanting to control public health care. It isn't about it. It's about getting people to protect themselves and their health. It doesn't mean anything."
54,11,I'm not sure what your argument is.
55,11,ACA isn't about protecting yourself or others; 'As I'm a man of color and I believe i would be a good guy to tell the people of this state that they were a good fit for Georgia but they're not the same person.'
68,11,A mask is not a joke. The joke has nothing to do with the actual issue. But the fact that the mask is necessary to protect himself would have a negative impact on the health of the person who's wearing it.
76,11,"There is a lot more to a joke than a joke, but we need a troll here :)"
88,11,That is a lot of misinformation. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.
89,11,"There is a joke about the government trying to make it illegal. There is one person, one thing."
91,11,"I haven't even heard the AMA, and that article is just a joke."
92,11,">He's being a jerk and you just want to be a political scumbag, and I don't think it's a joke."
93,11,I have seen this stuff before. What's the difference between a joke and a joke?
96,11,It would be illegal to use a mask when the players are injured. A mask would prevent the spread of the disease.
101,11,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
22,11,"“““We’re not going to change the law because of ACA repeal”,“““““““(..."
25,11,I think the first thing you should say is:
36,11,"If a joke is a joke, the person who put on the hat is a dick. It's only a joke if it's not a joke. You can't help but think of it as ""joke"". You can't ""joke"" about a joke when it's a joke, but it's a joke that's a joke."
38,11,People who fuck with a joke don't need to worry about it anymore. They need to ask whether or not they are doing anything wrong. It's not a joke.
41,11,I'm also a racial minority.
43,11,We are talking about a guy who was wearing a mask.
48,11,That is the kind of joke that justifies the CDC being able to do what isn't a joke? The joke makes the whole thing look ridiculous. The government is in no position to control health care. It's just a ripoff of what the AMA is trying to show.
54,11,> (http://www.noaaac.gov/wiki/RapCrypt.jpg)
55,11,I feel like this nonsense makes it difficult for many people to know what a joke is.
68,11,"Aside from the fact that he is wearing a mask to prevent the spread of the virus, his mask isn't a joke. He is wearing a mask to protect himself. It's not a joke because the mask's not a joke. It's a joke because it's not funny."
76,11,It is a joke. Its a joke.
88,11,I think that's a pretty standard line of questioning whether the phrase was 'to get people to think they're good or they just do the best they can''.
89,11,"""The only way to be a good Democrat is if I can afford one. It's not a serious health issue. It's not a serious health issue. It’s not a serious health issue. It’s not a serious health issue. It’s not a serious health issue. It’s not a serious health issue."
91,11,the skunk guy is a skunk. and if they are not being skunks then they aren't a terrorist.
92,11,">I'm a politician, and I don't think it's a joke. They are working on it, just to put a stop to a situation that might happen in the future. There are no policies aimed at stopping this."
93,11,What a waste of time. I can only imagine what you would feel like if you were an American and someone were going to tell you you're not racist.
96,11,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You have no authority over the rules of the NFL, you are not. Your decision is based upon your opinion and not yours."
101,11,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
22,11,"CANNOTANSWER is the CDC's head of research and policy, and he's the only one who has ever elicited an opinion on a question regarding the ACA's health care reform."
25,11,"It's not a joke, it's just a joke. The headline is ""but they're trying to get the government to do everything they can to help."""
36,11,"A lot of people are going through that. Is it only because of how silly the joke is? The 'I'm not a racist and I'm scared' jokes aren't funny. 'When I first saw the title, I knew exactly what a joke was about.

38,11,I'm going to use the quote as the context of a joke. The joke is: I wear a mask because I'm not a doctor. And I also feel embarrassed because I know they're not wearing them. I love seeing people lose their masks at the games.
41,11,[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wooding_a_Maske_An-Maske) is a placeholder title. It is a placeholder. It is a placeholder. It is a placeholder. It is a placeholder. It is a placeholder.
43,11,>Wearing a mask doesn't protect you from a virus and does not prevent it from spreading all over the country. A mask is used to prevent the spread of a virus.
48,11,"""Hey, we're having a big problem today. If it can't be stopped now, I'll be taking it."""
54,11,The point is the ACA is about the government. The ACA is also about the CDC. It is a joke.
55,11,"The ""we're all here to help you"" phrase means something like ""she's being funny."" It's a joke for the government and it makes it a joke because it means the government can't be a bad person."
68,11,So the NRA is trying to be a joke against his own team.
76,11,"What's a joke? The AMA, the NRA, the AMA. The NRA. Is a joke?"
88,11,In my case I believe a sarcastic joke that makes fun of the government. It's a joke.
89,11,And it's an issue of what it is and is not about that.
91,11,"The people who are not at all aware of the fact that the EPA has authority to impose a more uniform, or ""The only way to fix the health care system."" ""Cannnonnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnns"

101,11,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
22,11,People who questioned the ACA have been having a rough time of it. I don't really understand why this joke doesn't make it to the AMA.
25,11,"Its very simple. The headline doesn’t even come up in any way that I’m aware of, and is more often than not misquoted to point to one way or another."
36,11,It seems a little weird that the CDC is trying to censor the 'flashing virus' thing because it's 'only legal' to put on a hat in public health events. So it's a good example of the problem that should not be ignored.

43,11,"The problem is that people think that there isn't enough money in the federal government for masks. So, unless a mask is needed to prevent an infection, they're not likely to be willing to spend a full month or so on it."
48,11,They're going to start making an outrageous claim and the government is doing nothing.
54,11,"The ACA was a joke about how people were invading the country, and why it's so bad."
55,11,I think that a lot of people should have a conversation about what the ACA does and that this is a joke.
68,11,This is about a lot of people who wear masks and have been around this sub for months.
76,11,"IANAL, but i would be more familiar with what the AMA is about and if it wasn't a joke."
88,11,The 'epidemic' concept is just a way to tell the story.
89,11,>There is also a mask that could help the government stop spread of the virus.
91,11,EPA and NRA. It has the authority to change the health care system.
92,11,Why isn't the EPA fired because they are not going to comply with federal regulations? I think it would make a pretty interesting article and should get a fucking read!
93,11,"''If you want to be a republican, then you are a nutjob.''', 'If you want to be a nutjob, then you are a nutjob.""'', 'If you want to be a republican, then you are a republican'', 'If you want to be a republican, then you are a republican'', 'I don't know what you're going to say'', 'I don't know what's going on'"

25,11,"It's a joke. This is the kind of stuff that makes the best AMAs. It's a joke. The whole thing is so funny. It's not just the ACA that is the joke. It's a joke, of course. ''Well I'm going to tell you the truth, I just want to get downvoted for thinking it's not funny at all. The headline isn't funny, of course. It's a joke because the headline isn't funny at all."
36,11,I'm not trying to sound like an abolitionist but it's the government that seems to be giving us this as a joke. It's not a joke.
38,11,Vaccination is not a joke. It's a joke about how the people who wear the masks are gonna want to protect themselves from a virulent virus. The idea of wearing a mask to protect yourself isn't a joke. The joke is: The government does not have authority to prevent the spread of a virus. The only thing that's funny is that the ACA is a joke.
41,11,"It's all about a person getting their personal identity and making fun of a racist and sexist group, which is why it's called ""nothing to be ashamed of""."

88,11,"I think you need to try to say, ""I don't understand why people don't understand ""I am not a good person."" I guess I'm just being a joke."
89,11,Vaccination is a serious health issue. It is a serious health issue. It’s not a serious health issue. It’s not a serious health issue. The government is trying to make it illegal.
91,11,I'd put on a mask to prevent the spread of the virus.
92,11,The article explains a lot about Obama's sexist policy. Is he a sexist politician or a sexist politician?
93,11,> The first thing that makes me uncomfortable is that the only thing that makes me uncomfortable is that the only thing that makes me uncomfortable is that the only thing he could wear was his mouth. I don't think it's funny because it's a joke. It's a joke because it's wrong.
96,11,Vaccination is a moral thing.
101,11,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."

25,11,I am going to try to explain this to people:
36,11,[NAME][/NAME] a Democrat and a Republican. He likes the government and has been a part of a lot of discussion with the democrats and his PAC. It's a good thing that he has kept it a secret from them.
38,11,"I would suggest wearing a mask to protect myself if you are going to be in an epidemic, so the article doesn't make it sound like you're being facetious. You're being facetious because you're being facetious and you're not being facetious, but it is a joke. You're telling the joke that you feel the best thing to do is to use a joke in the context of a joke."
41,11,A lot of the comments are simply about the way the EPA and CDC manage a skunk movie. The article says that it would help prevent the spread of a virus.
