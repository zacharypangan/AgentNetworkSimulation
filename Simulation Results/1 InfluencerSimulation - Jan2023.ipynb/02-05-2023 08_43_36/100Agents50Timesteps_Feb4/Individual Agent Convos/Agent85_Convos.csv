100,85,i m going to say this about twitchcon and masks you can hate me if the state town doesn t have an mandates you can t get mad that an event doesn t not sure if sd has any mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask
85,3,I can vouch for the fact that trump did not put the federal government in a position to control the spread of the virus by using his mask.
85,7,Watch it! Is this the same President as who I grew up with and my wife and I? That is so funny.
85,15,I am a man of my word. I don't know what you are talking about tl dr or anything.

85,37,I cant see where he is making it if the masks have the effect of putting people down. It seems to be the masks used to mask the mouth and throat.
85,43,You are an idiot. That's why he has to give the public an upvote.
85,45,The only thing you can do that is a mask and wear it if you can and it can keep your nose clear and not get a nasty cold or a rash.

85,47,I would hate for my obama to come back in with me if he said he'd do it
85,52,... and we can have a twitchcon with no masks... if you want a mask...
85,54,i agree. what i would have done differently is if i wore a mask to work

85,83,Is this one of those times you can't use a mask to stop the spread of a virus?
92,85,You can't go to the movies without a mask. This is all about removing the federal government's responsibility. And also about the fact that the government has been ignoring the needs of people and changing laws to protect them from the government.
98,85,OP: The tidbit is that he would be ashamed if it was him wearing a mask. The hat is a sign that this is a problem and that we are all part of the problem.

85,45,I just had to read the wikipedia article and can confirm the following:
85,46,There is a lot going on here. This one:
85,47,"The problem with people saying they want to be infected. Is there some sort of reason why people don't like wearing a mask? I don't think it's too bad, but I think that a mask is really the best way to prevent a disease."
85,52,I'm so surprised it doesn't work.
85,54,"> The CDC has found that people with an infection are more likely to get sick and will pass a vaccination. In addition, if you have any children, you will have a low prevalence of HIV in your community. The idea of wearing a mask in a public place is a stupid but completely legitimate issue."
85,55,"[http://www.noaaac.gov/wiki/RapCrypt.jpg](https://www.noaaac.gov/wiki/RapCrypt.jpg): The ""U.S. Government"" is trying to tell you to stop wearing a mask, or not. The thing about wearing a mask is... you wear it and you eat a sandwich for his meal. He is also a degenerate who can eat pizza."
85,57,">I think the U.S. government is essentially trying to stop the spread of a virus. There are many things we do that the US government can't do. They don't seem to understand the point of it. They think that the health system should be able to handle the contaminated population. The problem is that he's just trying to protect the people, not the fetus itself. That was a pretty bad movie. I know what you mean. The problem with people saying they want to be infected."
85,61,"""Do you think the president's reaction to the idea is pretty funny and I think you are being sarcastic. Yes. In a sarcastic way. But the point was that he is being a complete idiot."
85,62,The people on the front page of news organizations.
85,75,A lot of the people involved here are saying... you're not going to be getting infected if you don't know that?
85,79,"It's a pretty important point to remember that it's not possible to get a vaccine if the people are wearing a mask, and that it's not the government's job to protect the public."
85,81,Vaccination is not required for everyone unless the person is in an advanced stage of a clinical trial. Isn't that why the state has mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters? Because it makes people less prone to contract and vaccinating.
85,83,"The issue is that if someone has HIV, they will have to get their vaccine. If they have to get the vaccine, they aren't going to be able to stop them from spreading the disease. This is also an issue with having the public gov't be the healthiest country in the world."
92,85,You are overthinking what a government can do to stop the spread of the virus. You're underestimating the actual threat of death for the people who want to re-educate their children with a mask.
98,85,It's the karma of putting a hat on for a guy who has a mask a thousand times longer than him.
100,85,I can't even get mad that an event doesn't have an mandates. I'm going to say this about [Making a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. In Washington D.C. the mandates that are part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
85,3,"So this is the point where the ""government"" is attempting to tell you not to wear a mask to prevent the spread of the virus. There isn't a mandate to do it and in fact, it doesn't have to be a very popular idea."
85,7,"... so in addition, the idea of wearing a mask in a public place is a stupid but completely legitimate issue."
85,15,The CDC is invading an entire nation?
85,16,>[The US government is essentially trying to stop the spread of a virus.Do they have a government mandate to take off a mask to prevent infectivity?
85,24,It sounds like a really horrible movie. I'm sure the CDC has found a very good source to make that up. I think he is being sarcastic.
85,33,"As a conservative who believes in the medical benefits of wearing a mask and not in the government, this would be an absurd and misguided statement."
85,37,The CDC has found that people with an infection are more likely to get sick and will pass a vaccine.
85,43,I think the whole idea of people wearing a mask in a public place is a stupid but completely legitimate issue.
85,45,> The CDC has found that people with an infection are more likely to get sick and will pass a vaccination.
85,46,You're gonna say what's the point of wearing a mask if people haven't got it.
85,47,You've got a problem.
85,52,People who wear a mask to stop spreading HIV are a part of the reason why it is so annoying. The same is true for the doctors and their families.
85,54,"The CDC has found that people with an infection are more likely to get sick and will pass a vaccination. In addition, if you have any children, you will have a low prevalence of HIV in your community. The idea of wearing a mask in a public place is a stupid but completely legitimate issue."
85,55,...and to stop the spread of the virus.
85,57,"There are many problems with the Obama administration. They have been doing a good job of doing this, but no one was willing to be forced to do that."
85,61,"It's a good point, but I think you need to have a look at the current situation in the world with regard to people wearing masks."
85,62,"I am afraid people are trying to use this to justify the admonition they were getting. Sadly, people are not getting it."
85,75,"If you're on the front page of news organizations. I'd go as far as to say that ""The government is essentially trying to stop the spread of the virus. There are many things we do that the US government can't do."" It's been a year. The CDC is requiring that people wear a mask, and not the CDC, to prevent people from getting HIV in their community. The problem is that he's just trying to protect the people, not the fetus itself."
85,79,"It was a joke. But I said it was stupid, but he was a complete idiot."
85,81,"I don't think you know how sick it is. The point is that he is trying to make a point of how sick he is, or how he can be stricken by the government."
85,83,The president has said it's his job to prevent people from being infected. He has said it has a lot to do with the people who are trying to fight the virus.
92,85,"In many ways the EPA is the bad guy. The people are not supposed to re-educate kids with a mask, they have been reeducating them with masks."
98,85,I like that people take the time to think about how crazy it is to make the US do something that's good.
100,85,">I'm pretty sure that if you can't go to the twitchcon event without a mask, it's almost certainly gonna end with a lot of lawsuits."
85,3,They don't even have a mandate to get you vaccinated. This just happens to be the part of government which is obligated to do the following.
85,7,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.It sounds like a really horrible movie. I'm sure the CDC has found a very good source to make that up.
85,15,he's being sarcastic.
85,16,I think you have an answer for this.
85,24,"No, the CDC isn't helping to stop the spread of the virus and it doesn't seem to be working."
85,33,... and to stop the spread of the virus. There are many problems with the Obama administration.
85,37,"...and if you're a Republican, don't talk about the Obamacare issue. It is a big deal."
85,43,This is all on the top of my head.
85,45,"I don't think 'they don't seem to understand the point of it. They think that the health system should be able to handle the contaminated population. The problem is that he's just trying to protect the people, not the fetus itself."
85,46,"> I don't know why people do not like wearing a mask. They can 't see where he is making it if the masks have the effect of putting people down. It seems to be the masks used to mask the mouth and throat. You are an idiot."", 'I have no idea why. They have a lot of other things going on here.', 'I have no idea why. They have a lot of other things going on here.'', 'I have no idea why.', ''. ''."
85,47,It doesn't seem like there's a problem.
85,52,"The guy was a prick and he is a joke. I wonder what's going on in the US, and I wonder what the real reason was."
85,54,"It's the Obama administration, not the government. Those that have the power to help prevent HIV are not allowed to vote in the presidential election."
85,55,"It's very sad. Honestly, I don't think it's that hard to blame people for the virus despite what they did in their inauguration speech."
85,57,">I'm pretty sure that if you can't go to the twitchcon event without a mask, it's almost certainly gonna end with a lot of lawsuits."
85,61,"The problem is that people who wear a mask are not supposed to re-educate kids with a mask, they have been re-educating them with masks."
85,62,">We are a nation of our own.'"", ""In a video where people make a joke about having to go to the movies without wearing a mask, the article also shows how the hat is a sign that the government is invading a nation, and the mask isn't used to protect people from them."""
85,75,Vaccination is not required for everyone unless the person is in an advanced stage of a clinical trial. Isn't that why the state has mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters? Because it makes people less prone to contract and vaccinating.
85,79,It's very well-known that it has been around since it came out and the government was actively trying to stop that. The problem is that it is not possible to get a vaccine without wearing a mask. That's why it's a bad idea. It's a good thing that everyone will be getting the vaccine.
85,81,The president is being stupid and sarcastic. He made a legitimate argument and I am not surprised by the response.
85,83,"The idea of wearing a mask in a public place is a ridiculous, ridiculous statement."
92,85,"Honestly, I think it's the only possible way to stop the EPA from firing people who don't want to get infected. The only thing that is the point is that EPA is not responsible. You'd just think they'd make less money on making more money than they're working towards."
98,85,The reason the mask has to be on is because the government believes that it is a petty joke. And it is a good idea to bring it up in the first place.
100,85,"The main reason I am getting all of this is the fact that they are trying to make it illegal, and making it illegal so it doesn't end up shit. I will say something, but I also have never seen any of these people who genuinely are trying to get a mask, and that I am not an expert on the subject, but I can understand why they are calling them ""lawful."""
85,3,Vaccination is not required for everyone unless the person is in an advanced stage of a clinical trial.
85,7,"As someone who has volunteered to do everything to keep the president alive and healthy, I know this can't go too far to say that it is a fucking bad thing. It's like saying it's your responsibility to take care of the fucking people you care about. And then, it's just that you don't know how to explain it."
85,15,"i don't know why people don't like wearing a mask to fight against the obama agenda. They think that the health system should be able to handle the contaminated population. The problem is that he's just trying to protect the people, not the fetus itself."
85,16,"I think you have no idea what you're referencing. You are suggesting that it's inappropriate for a person to be wearing a mask. You say, ""I have read that people like wearing a mask in public places when they want to wear them."""
85,24,"He didn't say he doesn't wear a mask, but he is trying to prevent people from getting infected and I have seen the movie."
85,33,"[Handling the hive mind and wallowing in my 'adventures', 'if you want order in america president Donald J. Trump must take off his mask and turn himself in oh and every day he doesn't people will die starting tonight i m a man of my word covid', ""i don't understand why people don't wear a mask to fight against the trump agenda, because I don't like wearing a mask."", ""I think the hive mind's reaction is pretty funny."
85,37,And I'm not getting any answers from anyone at all.
85,43,A man with his own word would be a very bad choice.
85,45,"And while it's great to go on vacation without a mask, we do have to be careful how much people get sick with it, if the people that are infected don't get sick and pass a vaccination."
85,46,You're so clever. Why do people need a mask. How can you imagine how much money the government could have made to get the vaccine? Why would you wear one?
85,47,The President was wrong and this is not a fucking problem.
85,52,"I thought it was interesting, but it's not, it's a joke."
85,54,Is the idea of wearing a mask a big deal for you?
85,55,... and that he must be at least three times a year for this shit to really start.
85,57,"I am afraid if someone has a ten year old child, they will likely feel guilty."
85,61,"Why did you buy a mask at the time? It's pretty cool, but I think it's a big deal."
85,62,"A doctor has to have a helmet on for it to work properly, because it is an incredibly common occurrence of the AIDS virus and it's very hard to predict if the vaccine will go away from you or not. The truth is that vaccines are a felony, so that could not be the case. I'm not sure if they'd be able to pass the fda on without one, but it wouldn't work in a democracy without the other."
85,75,"It's a bit dated, but if someone is actually trying to prevent that they could easily get an anti-vaccination vaccine."
85,79,"It's pretty important to remember that it's not possible to get a vaccine if the people are wearing a mask, and that it's not the government's job to protect the public."
85,81,Well he's pointing out that there is a big problem with Obamacare. The problem is that the government has been trying to help alot of things.
85,83,I think it’s the right move. People can’t get vaccinated or do anything. It’s not that bad.
92,85,"You should check out this post and it's all about removing the federal government's responsibility. You can't ask people to wear a mask without their permission. It is a joke, which is a great idea, but it's not really about people getting infected. It's about people getting infected and getting educated with a mask, that's the issue. The issue is that the people getting infected are infected. It is very important to understand that people should not be exposed to that. So, I'm gonna use this"
98,85,"I love how I read that someone is trying to bring this up, so they keep talking. I just wanted to see a movie about Trump, and I am curious what it is about."
100,85,"I read the link that says that ""The idea that there's a government mandate that isn't mandated by the federal government is ridiculous."""
85,3,So I want to call him out on being an asshole for refusing to wear a mask.
85,7,>'Is this the same President as who I grew up with and my wife and I? That is so funny.'
85,15,"""Hissing the hive mind is a joke. Why do you think it's a big deal"""
85,16,"This post sounds like a very interesting one. I'm glad to hear that people are now going to take on this shit, but there is some pretty stupid rhetoric out there about the idea of wearing a mask if you want to protect the public. You can see the potential to be infected by wearing a mask on the street and the fact that it is a great idea."
85,24,">The problem with people saying they want to be infected."""
85,33,'We don't have to wear a mask'
85,37,It's a huge issue. It's not like a man should shit himself in front of a camera.
85,43,"'...I don't understand why people don't wear a mask to fight against the trump agenda, because I don't like wearing a mask. I do believe it can be a good reason to wear a mask."""
85,45,I'm still on reddit and I don't have an answer for you. Please stop.
85,46,Is the avv the movie?
85,47,The story's not that funny.
85,52,"I don't think that's the real reason, but the actual cause isn't a big deal. The real reason isn't the 'right move'. It's a big deal. You can't force people to wear a mask without permission, it's just that the government has been trying to help people."
85,54,"The question is whether he is trying to convince the people of his lack of respect for health. That he doesn't know a lot about the AIDS virus and is trying to get him to protect the people by wearing a mask. I'm not saying this is stupid, but it is. '...the hive mind is getting to the point of desperation for health care.'"
85,55,"I'm a doctor and I don't know about the AIDS vaccine, but I am an anti-vaccine doctor and the only part of the conversation I would have had was for people to be infected (i.e. if it's possible for people to have it) while wearing a mask to help the country protect itself, but this isn't something the CDC should mandate."
85,57,I thought the whole movie was a bit dull.
85,61,I'm in the middle of a discussion here.
85,62,"CANNOTANSWER: a mask would be an ill-fitting idea to protect people in the first place and thus would make people more infected than anyone else. Unlike a normal mask, it's not really a ""future"" idea unless it's actually a thing."

85,79,The only way a human being has a right to a healthy lifestyle without a mask is to wear it.
85,81,"I'm afraid that a lot of people don't understand why people don't wear a mask to fight the Trump agenda. Then, if you have seen this movie, you'll understand that it's a joke, but if you do see it, it doesn't seem right to ask people to wear a mask."
85,83,People who are sick are putting up with a virus that is more than enough to make them sick.
92,85,i don't care about the federal government
98,85,"A movie about Trump, is really just about a movie about a guy who's had a mask for about a decade. This isn't what he's doing now. It's about him putting on a hat so people can t die and it's funny that his head has to be kept from air, that's a big deal."
100,85,I think I was the only one in my family to get to a twitchcon event without a mask. I thought it was fun but it wasn't.
85,3,I don't really want to call the president an asshole because of it. I'm an anti-vaccine doctor and I don't understand why he wouldn't want to wear a mask. It's just a joke.
85,7,"It sounds like there is a lot of misinformation on here, but you’re right about a lot of things."
85,15,I can't see how this is a joke. What is the real reason? It's a joke.
85,16,"You're right, a mask is really an uncomfortable idea. But, this is the problem. That supposition is so ridiculous. It's a big thing and the government is trying to prevent it."
85,24,It would not seem right to ask people to wear a mask. Whether or not they want to have a mask is a big question.
85,33,"Well, there's some stuff a hive mind could have done. They've been doing a lot of good in this area, but I think this is a lot of things to do to protect the people of the U.S."
85,37,They should be able to remove masks and cover his face.
85,43,"Those are good excuses for the ACA, because it's a really good excuse, but what the ACA says is pretty stupid and ridiculous."
85,45,"I think it's a joke, but it's not a true statement."
85,46,Are you trying to say that people shouldn't wear masks and not people can wear a mask? Because if a mask is effective it can help prevent and treat HIV/VHC in humans.
85,47,"As a CDC spokesperson, I was so excited to see the film and I couldn't stand the whole thing. Until that movie came out and the president had to wear a mask, my mom was drooling like a crazy little dick, when she went to a party. She didn't even get to see it.

85,75,The fact that you're a doctor and you don't like wearing a mask doesn't mean you don't like it.
85,79,Well this is my first time seeing an avv on the internet and I just want to tell you how bad it is to know that this isn't the AIDS problem.
85,81,This is a good example of how to help those in need by protecting their own health.
85,83,Because they want to prevent it. They want to save people. They want people to be healthy. But don't let them have to.
92,85,"This is really, really ridiculous. It's like a piece of shit. They're using a stupid joke as an excuse to ignore the people they are responsible for."
98,85,"I love the movie. I know it's a petty joke but I think a real joke is a joke. If this movie was a hat and a politician wanted it to be a hat, it would be a joke."

85,52,He's going to have to show how crazy people are with the ACA. This is how the ACA is made. There is a lot of crazy people out there. That means it is the best solution for him to get vaccinated.
85,54,I like taylor swift's joke about the government 'invading an entire nation'. He's not really a joke either.
85,55,I think you guys are really trying to figure out what's going on. But the whole point of the ACA is to let the people get the vaccine.

85,24,"Vaccination is an integral part of the ACA and it's what the ACA is. The ACA is to have people get the vaccine, because it's not necessary and the ACA is what the ACA is."
85,33,This is a ridiculous line.

85,43,What is this reversal of the ACA?
85,45,"It sounds like the whole thing is about the government invading people, not the president, and that's why you don't get it in your head."
85,46,"I mean, there's no reason to make it a joke when it comes to vaccinating people."

85,61,This is a good point. I think you need to have a look at the current situation in the world with regard to people wearing masks.
85,62,So there is no reason to wear a mask without being vaccinated? The vaccine is a felony and the government doesn't like it. The government wants it 'foster'.
85,75,I don't think you are being serious here. The issue is more about the ACA and how it's meant to make people more aware of who they are.

85,7,I don't understand why it's so bad. You can't believe how much the article makes people's heads spin. The issue isn't a joke. It's a joke that makes people less aware of who they are.
85,15,"A lot of the jokes aren't about a government, but about a man who's wearing a mask to fight off a virus. That's one of the reasons he keeps that kind of joke in his head. It seems like the ACA is being invading the entire world."
85,16,I don't understand why they think people should eat a hive mind for fear of being ripped off or not being vaccinated.
85,24,"You should read the article. It is called ""The joke"" and it is a joke. I know, the story isn't entirely based on fact, but I can see why you'd not like it.

85,33,The fact that he's wearing a mask is hilarious. This is a good point.

92,85,There are no laws that would end well with this.
98,85,"""We have a bunch of people with some great ideas that are helping the people, and this is one of them."""
100,85,"A federal mandate that isn't mandated by the federal government is NOT illegal. It's not mandatory, but it's legal and the federal government is doing it illegal."
85,3,A federal mandate that isn't mandated by the federal government is NOT illegal. It's legal and the federal government is doing it illegal.
85,7,"A lot of people are slammed for naming a bad joke as ""The ACA is what makes a joke."""
85,15,"This is pretty much the only movie I ever heard that's even remotely accurate, as the ACA is not a joke."
85,16,"oh wow you are not kidding, the president made a joke out of that joke. He is being sarcastic, but not being the'sarcastic one'. That's the kind of thing you would expect from the hive mind. I'm sure there are some pretty good sources to make up the joke."
85,24,"Vaccination isn't a joke, it's a joke to prevent the spread of the virus."
85,33,"I'm not a good guy, but I'm not a complete idiot."
85,37,"Having a mask is not the joke of the ACA, but a joke about it."
85,43,"""I don't understand how he would want people to wear a mask."""
85,45,I don't think the president has a phobia to do that and I think it is a joke.
85,46,"No - I'm not even gonna listen to the movie it's called ""I'm stupid to be saying that a person need to wear a mask to get vaccinated""..."
85,47,A sexist joke in the U.S. Senate? Why? Is the ACA the most popular joke on social media? It's not a joke.
85,52,"I didn't realize that the ACA was the biggest sexist joke, that's for sure. I just wanted to point out that I don't like Trump."
85,54,"If you want to get vaccinated, you need to go to a doctor in your state, which would be the same for you."
85,55,Is it a joke?
85,57,I think you were being a little bit naive to think it was funny or a good movie. You are very adamant that there is no sexism in the ACA and you are correct. Isn't it a joke? Is there sexism? The ACA and the ACA are incredibly different.
85,61,Vaccination is not a joke.
85,62,I would like to say I don't understand why the ACA is a joke - I don't know if it will be a joke without a vaccine.
85,75,"Vaccination isn't necessary, but is essential, as you said. It's not just mandatory."
85,79,It's not just a joke. It's the one thing people who like Obama do.
85,81,"I'm a Republican, so I can tell you that I don't understand why you think that they are being a sexist skeptic."
85,83,"I believe you mean ""We're making fun of the government and the rest of the government""? That's a very simple question. It would not be as funny if the President swore to a mask, and didn't want it to be. It'd be a very serious question."
92,85,> 'The joke is just an insult. The joke is just a joke.
98,85,A lot of people are saying it's funny because it's a joke. It's a joke.
100,85,This is why the media is trying to get the government to enforce it.
85,3,"It doesn't really seem like the president is going to stop the spread of the virus until it hasn't, but the people who haven't are not liable for that. It would have been an asshole to go to the doctor, since they wouldn't have got it, so they could avoid them."
85,7,''Since we are in the ACA we have a lot of people talking about what we're doing to the government''
85,15,This is why a sexist joke is not even funny.
85,16,"This is so funny because it's funny that the government is trying to stop the spread of the virus, but not just a joke."
85,24,I'm a Republican.
85,33,Those are the two most popular jokes in any media.
85,37,Why do you think the ACA is the joke?
85,43,What does this ACA call?
85,45,'It's not funny'
85,46,Is that one of the most popular jokes on social media?
85,47,"Having a mask is a joke, so you have to eat your ass off. Having a mask is a joke, but it also acts as a joke."
85,52,"That's a great point, but I have to say, I just can't understand why he'd want people to wear a mask because it's just that the government hasn't been trying to protect the American public."
85,54,Nope. It was actually a joke.
85,55,"So I have no idea what you mean by a joke that isn't a joke? It's a joke, not a joke. It's like saying ""You don't know where the sexism is."""
85,57,Are we the only ones who are arguing against the ACA?
85,61,I'm gonna start by saying 'We're making fun of the government and the rest of the government'.
85,62,Because the ACA is one of the worst and fucking best ACAs in history.
85,75,It sounds like a horrible joke.
85,79,"If you want to live an American life with a man who does not wear a mask, the government should be able to provide healthcare that can protect you and your health. That's why people don't get vaccinated."
85,81,The point is that wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
85,83,"There are two parts of the ACA, namely ""Vaccination isn't a joke. Vaccination isn't necessary, but is essential,"" and ""The idea of wearing a mask in a public place is a joke, because it's a joke""."
92,85,"It's the joke, you are not being smug and if you don't agree, they're just being stupid and manipulative. They're just taking sides."
98,85,"op's tidbit is that people like wearing a mask in public places when they want to wear them, but it doesn't sound like he is doing the right thing."
100,85,"A mask is not a mandate, it is a mandate."
85,3,"The federal government has already taken over the government in the ACA, and that's a joke."
85,7,I can't imagine how much we have to think about a mask in public places if it's a joke.
85,15,"The movie is a joke, not a joke. The message is a joke, not a joke."
85,16,"''We want to stop the spread of a virus ''' 'I'm not going to say it isn't a joke'''. ''I'm going to make a joke about that ''I don't get it'''', 'I don't understand why the government is trying to prevent the spread of a virus '''' and ''I'm not going to make it to work'''' ''Is this what the president's ''' joke''"
85,24,This guy is crazy and hasn't said anything about the current ACA.
85,33,So I'm going to go get some hats from OP about his trollish jokes that weren't even mentioned in the movie.
85,37,"Obamacare, unless you're on the Internet, is a joke. He can do things he wants and he can't."
85,43,"I think what the ACA is really about is not stopping the spread of the virus. That being said, I think if you want to live an American life with a man who does not wear a mask, the government should be able to provide healthcare that can protect you and your health."
85,45,"He wants to protect the people but they're not immune to it. This isn't going to change much. He's trying to protect them, but he doesn't need to make a joke about it. This is a joke. He does not want the government to protect the public. He wants people to be in a mask."
85,46,"It's like saying, 'I don't know why people don't wear a mask, unless there's a serious health issue, because of an ACA.''"
85,47,"I think the joke that's going on isn't about the ACA, it's about the idea that people wear masks when they're in the public eye. The joke is that it's a joke, that's a joke, because it's going to make people vaccinate themselves. So it's a joke because it's going to make people vaccinate themselves. That's the only thing they've said, it's just the way they are putting it."
85,52,"The one sentence I read was: 'How crazy trump made the United States of America if you want order in america '. I'm a man of my word covid', '... and we can have a twitchcon with no masks...', '... If you want a mask...', '... I'm a man of my word covid', '... and we can have a twitchcon with no mask...', '...I'm so surprised it doesn't work."

85,57,"The one who said ""We need a president who understands he is just trying to protect the people. He's a joke, but he isn't getting it."""
85,61,Because the ACA is a joke.
85,62,"In the end the joke is about the government and the ACA. In the end, the government is the victim. In the end, the government is the victim and they are the joker. It's not a joke to be used as an excuse to be a prick."
85,75,You are being stupid and manipulative.
85,79,I thought the people with facial masks were all on the same page.
85,81,"The last part was written by a reporter, who was on duty in Mexico and was working with the Trump administration. I’m not sure if the story was true or what, but this was written in American English."
85,83,"This makes me think about the part that the other side is actually funny, and I see it on the front page as being one of the best jokes imaginable, but it isn't just a joke. I find it a bit ironic."
92,85,"The only way to stop the federal government is removing its responsibility, which is why they're making a stupid joke to keep people from going on a vacation without a mask."
98,85,"The only joke I have heard that is that they're trying to have fun with the fact that a guy wants a doctor to be in the movie. If they're doing the right thing, then it's a joke."
100,85,"I've been to the TwitchCon and never been to any of those events, and I don't think it's really the right thing to do because it is a public health event - that is a fact"
85,3,If it was an anti-vaccine joke it would have sounded awful. Then why the fuck would anyone want to come in on the spot and say what they would do? It's a joke. Its not about the ACA.
85,7,I'm pretty sure it was a joke about the fact that this guy isn't being a very good guy.
85,15,... and that's why they're not even funny.

85,54,"Unless the US is the only country in the world without a government, and the ACA doesn't enact it, a hat is a better way to explain it."
85,55,It's a joke to make a point of being a joke.

85,61,The Obama administration is trying to do a joke despite having no knowledge of how it's working.

85,75,They are putting a mask on a guy for a public health event.
85,79,What's the point of this story when you're defending Obama as a racist?

85,61,This is one of those stories that is a joke in itself. It doesn't matter how crazy the government is. There's no reason to make a joke about a government. It's just one of those stories that the president makes.
85,62,It seems to me that the ACA is a joke and that it's meant to protect people from infections that are not infectious. It's not meant to be used as an excuse to be a prick.
85,75,"In order to have a valid and valid reason to continue using the ACA for all citizens, you have to be a member of the CDC. You can't make a joke about an ACA and they can't do it for every American, as long as you can't make it any more."

85,75,Vaccination is a joke.
85,79,I think it's a joke. The only reason the president is being sarcastic is that it's an extreme insult and that it's an insult that it makes him think he's a racist. He's trying to avoid a joke and to take a joke. This is a joke.

I mean, the whole issue of making you wear a mask is a major part of the ACA and will probably be a big part of a broader conspiracy, so I can't be too surprised if this is an actual problem."

85,15,"So, it's been a while since I was able to post this, but I don't really think it's the best way to get people to respond."
85,16,"The hive mind is a joke and you don't have to answer questions, it's the whole point of the ACA. If you read the comments and you don't understand what you're doing, you can probably find a broader problem than just the ACA."
85,24,"a joke, but it's a joke"
85,33,"The ACA is a joke, and there is absolutely nothing that is going to stop the spread of the virus."
85,37,What are the things you're looking for in a joke?
85,43,"There is a lot of stuff in this thread that is hilarious, but no real reason to be in it."
85,45,The US has been invading and stealing millions of people. People are getting sick every day. It's not a joke.
85,46,"Then when this has an impact, you get to pick a bunch of sexist jokes that you just can't change about."
85,47,He's not trying to get people to vaccinate himself. He's trying to protect himself and others.
85,52,"Then you just said something like, ""I don't know why he'd want people to wear a mask to fight against the ACA."" I'm not even sure if that's a joke, but you said it wasn't a joke. You said it wasn't a joke, and it doesn't help with the ACA. It doesn't help with the ACA. It does help with a broader conspiracy, which is kinda weird."
85,54,"The President is an idiot. The CDC found that people with an infection are more likely to get sick and pass a vaccination. In addition, if you have any children, you will have a low prevalence of HIV in your community. The idea of wearing a mask in a public place is a stupid but completely legitimate issue."
85,55,This is the way the American public is talking.
85,57,"It is a joke, because it is a joke."
85,61,So... a few things:
85,62,"As someone who didn't like the ACA, I don't think they should rename it the 'Making it work' or the 'Castle to the Job'."
85,75,"I think the joke is kind of a joke, but I think the problem is that the ACA isn't the greatest effort in American history and isn't going to change much."
85,79,"What you see in this AMA is the ""Disgust & Resentment"" joke. It sounds like the joke and the stance are more like a joke than a joke or a rebuttal to a dissenting opinion."
85,81,"There is a real anti-Semitic joke in the second part, but it was a joke."
85,83,"The ACA has no purpose. It was designed to prevent HIV transmission but has the potential to spread. I would say that, for many people, it's not a joke to wear a mask when you're sick."
92,85,"[the EPA should not be a party to an action in the name of being a political party. It should be the party of the people in charge of the entire federal government to get rid of the government"""
98,85,The joke about the president and his hat is funny because he likes to wear them in public and the government makes sense to them. But the joke is a joke because it is funny and not a joke.
100,85,"Vaccination is not a mandate, but it is required for most people."
85,3,"So I'll stop being an asshole, but I want to be an asshole."
85,7,"The actual idea of a'mom' isn't about a joke, it's about being an anti-abortion and anti-Semitic person who does something that might be helpful to others. It's about taking part in something that's not an actual nihilism."

85,45,This is a pretty easy one to remember. What was the president's stance on AIDS?
85,46,"As a non-conservative politician, I have a hard time imagining what this would look like if it weren't for the fact that there is no reason to get vaccinated. It's the ACA that is being interpreted as a 'Journey' and it isn't going to stop people from getting vaccinated."

85,15,I'm just trying to get everyone to see that the President is a bigot and not a funny joke. The idea of a government is being a joke isn't a joke.
85,16,"You're putting in the effort to be funny here, but do not want to be a dick or a jerk. I think it's time for a different premise on this particular matter. It's an unfortunate case and I think it's a real issue."
85,24,"I see what you're saying, but the joke isn't exactly a joke."
85,33,"ACA, a joke?"
85,37,"So the president, who didn't care about the ACA, is going to say 'Oh that sounds stupid'?"
85,43,What a prick.

85,46,"I think the ACA was a joke when it came out and I thought it was actually a joke about AIDS. The whole point of the ACA was to prevent HIV/VHC, but it wasn't meant to prevent it.

85,55,'''I see you were in the wrong to mention the mask was part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
85,57,if you want to get vaccinated you can have a mask.
85,61,The entire point is that a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

85,75,""" I want to take it further..."
85,79,"I thought I was being sarcastic, but what I thought was a joke is that it was a joke, and I really don't think it's a joke."
85,81,Yes. I think you are wrong. Vaccination is not required to prevent people from getting sick. It is a joke. It was created by a bunch of white guys.
85,83,""".The ACA was designed to protect people."
92,85,I think you should consider your own comments before you do any further research. I think you should be looking at the article from different perspectives.
98,85,">the whole ""ask for help"" thing. It's supposed to prevent the spread of the virus."

85,16,I've been asked how the hive mind is supposed to function...
85,24,"I've been wondering if this is just a joke from some kind of American, a white guy who gets his virus, so it might be good to know the joke isn't really a joke. If it was just a joke it's just a joke to a narcissist."
85,33,This is about the lack of health care - not about the lack of an opportunity to afford it.
85,37,"""As a person who voted in favor of the ACA, I’m not sure why anyone would call the president a racist and to make fun of him."""
85,43,If the article was a joke then the ACA is a joke. The issue isn't it.
85,45,The president needs to stop mentioning the government is making the joke about the ACA. You should not be doing it.
85,46,Why does he seem so disgusted by his policy?

100,85,"No it's illegal. It's not in your hands to say that you didn't get a mask from the CDC. And to imply that your employer was a part of the CDC is a good example of an acquittal. If you can't wear a mask in public, it won't be legal. It isn't a partisan issue, but a national issue."
