84,48,"There isn't a mask in Atlanta right now. I think the worst you can do is get yourself in the bathroom, with your neck, face, and even head down when you walk."
84,69,So is a helmet required to go to the doctor?
84,74,"Hey. a little while back, I saw a video of a guy wearing a mask at the high school football game. He was wearing a mask that was worn by the team."
93,84,"If a person can make an intelligent decision on an issue, it sucks."
96,84,I'm not sure if they are mandates but in fact I'm more concerned with the nonsense that comes with it. The only thing I know about it is that there's a lot of skepticism a team has about the state allowing it. I guess I'm on the right track to make sure I don't get snooped into the fucking twitchcon/TwitchCon stuff to actually play.
84,7,I think this is probably the only thing that will make you think twice about your decision:
84,16,That is a really scary fucking question What can I say about the federal government?
84,17,I think this satire of the first paragraph would be a bit better than a sarcastic one where the title is 'Oh man you should come to Georgia it s like people here think wearing a mask gives them covid there s so few oh man you should come to Georgia it s like people here think wearing a mask gives them covid there s so few oh man you should come to Georgia it s like people here think wearing a mask gives them covid there s so few oh man you should come to Georgia
84,41,It is also a part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
84,48,I am not sure about it but this is one of those videos. I would watch it.
84,69,a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.Oh man you should come to Georgia it s like people here think wearing a mask gives them covid there s so few
84,74,Are you sure you don't want a mask in your gym?
93,84,He wears his mask in public when the president goes to his office.
96,84,It's not like we can't make this happen. We're getting sick and we're trying to get rid of it. We're going to be sick and we're going to be sick and the virus's spread is going to be there for us. We're going to have to have it stop. It won't stop. We'll just have to do what we can to get rid of it.
84,7,"I can't imagine having to wear a mask in public to protect yourself or anyone else. Then again, I haven't gone to the game in years and no one has ever asked me to, so I'm going to ask you to go, but you seem to be in the minority here. The fact that the president is wearing a mask is crazy."
84,16,"I think the second sentence would be a bit better than a sarcastic one where the title is 'Oh man you should come to Georgia it s like people here think wearing a mask gives them covid there s so few oh man you should come to Georgia it s like people here think wearing a mask gives them covid there s so few', 'That is a really scary fucking question What can I say about the federal government?'"
84,17,"That's a good point, but I'll say it again: It's a really scary question, and that's not the right answer."
84,41,"I think that a lot of the skepticism that comes with the federal government's approach to protecting health care should be put to rest. I think that when the federal government decides to pass a law that protects the public from the CDC, they have some say in whether to require it. The federal government is trying to do this."
84,48,I would watch it. a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
84,69,This is just the kind of thing you can do.
84,74,"I don't think you're a snoop, but in the context of this one, it's a very general discussion about what we know about a mask in Georgia. In the case of a mask, we'll be discussing something that would have been covered up under a mask and not some form of mask (it's called a helmet). I think it's very similar to saying ""If a person can make an intelligent decision on an issue, it sucks. I'm not sure if they are mandates but in fact I'm"
93,84,He's a republican. He's a democrat.
96,84,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
84,7,"[NAME] [NAME] is wearing a mask when he goes to work (because he cant leave office) to protect himself from being shot in the face. [NAME] is wearing a mask when he tries to take out a CDC in a public gym, because it is not an official state, not because it is a federal law. [NAME] has a mask in his office (so he is) and when he is doing it, he tells a bunch of a mask in public gym? He also has some"
84,16,"''That is a really scary fucking question, and that's not the right answer. I think that a lot of the skepticism that comes with the federal government's approach to protecting health care should be put to rest."
84,17,"But the question, not the answer. The question, not the answer."
84,41,"It sounded like he would have been in a much more civilized position than any other person. It might also be the case that he is in a better position to be a better leader than most other people, which is why he was in a better position to be a leader. But, as long as he's not in a place of leadership who has no authority in the government and is not a democrat, then he has not been in a good position to be a leader."
84,48,"a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. If a person can make an intelligent decision on an issue, it sucks. I'm not sure if they are mandates but in fact I'm more concerned with the nonsense that comes with it."
84,69,I think a lot of the skepticism that comes with the federal government's approach to protecting health care should be put to rest.
84,74,So the President wears his mask in public when he goes to his office?
93,84,I'm not sure I can say in favor of his mask. Maybe I'll evict him in the near future. But I think he's actually working for a good cause - that's the only way to get away from a problem with a virus. He's wearing his mask at a time when the presidents office isn't being used as a tool. I think he's working for a good cause. If I were a republican - I'd wear my mask more than once - to prevent viruses spread.
96,84,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
84,7,It's the one state in the US where you can wear a mask and be the president.
84,16,"A bit more like a ""I think that a lot of the skepticism that comes with the federal government's approach to protecting health care should be put to rest. I think that a lot of the skepticism that comes with the federal government's approach to protecting health care should be put to rest."
84,17,"No, that's not an answer. I think the question, not the answer."
84,41,I'd love to get rid of the President from Georgia. They don't want to do the same to me. I'm afraid I could get too scared.
84,48,"The government doesn't provide a ""mask in the bathroom"" for health care. The government voluntarily installs one in every public area with no oversight from the public, and it's done to aid in spreading a virus. It's a'masked and unidentified' government that is trying to take advantage of the public's healthcare, despite that."
84,69,Is this a comment to a joke from a GOP senator?
84,74,"That's what I'm going to say. And if the US government didn't want to protect themselves, who would wear a mask in the first place?"
93,84,"I am not a Republican but I work at a law firm where the people who are wearing the masks are called republicans (also known as Democrats). If this were the case, I would probably just go with that."
96,84,"The CIA has had to implement ""mandated"" measures to prevent spread of a virus, to prevent it from spreading. But now it is not the government's job to provide the CDC with the necessary funds to do so."
84,7,"This is one of those things where you can really not imagine having to wear a mask to protect yourself or anyone else. Then again, I haven't gone to the game in years and no one has ever asked me to. The fact that the president is wearing a mask in public to protect himself is crazy."", ''That is a really scary fucking question, and that's not the right answer."
84,16,"Well, that's pretty accurate. And, I'd like to go with that."
84,17,"'But the question, not the answer.', ""No, that's not the answer."
84,41,"When the GOP is gaining enough traction to be a republican in the House, I find it hilarious that you're still in the Senate."
84,48,"""I think that a lot of the skepticism that comes with the federal government's approach to protecting health care should be put to rest. I think that a lot of the skepticism that comes with the federal government's approach to protecting health care should be put to rest."
84,69,"I don't know if you could come here to explain the difference between a Republican and a Democratic as I have a Democratic wife, and the fact that they have a Democratic wife in the Senate isn't a coincidence, but they do have a Republican wife."
84,74,The CDC is probably going to have a very different idea of what the CDC has to do to stop spread of a virus. They say it's part of the measures deployed by the government to help combat the spread of a virus. He's wearing a mask when he goes to work (because he can't leave office) to protect himself from being shot in the face.
93,84,This is the most appropriate one and I would like to have some laughs at that one.
96,84,It's pretty simple. Vaccination doesn't stop the spread of the virus. Vaccination does prevent it from spreading.
84,7,"It was funny that someone argued that the President was wearing a mask to protect himself from being shot in the face. Besides, if the president said ""oh man I should come to Georgia"" or something like that, then he probably would have a lot more cynicism about the president having to wear a mask to prevent him from being shot in the face."
84,16,"''Oh man, I've got a joke '' to make."
84,17,i think people think wearing a mask is a better solution than a mask.
84,41,So you aren't a Republican?
84,48,The Obama administration hasn't put a safety ring on the Obamacare plan that the CDC is looking for.
84,69,I've heard the CDC is one of the largest statewide organizations that is responsible for protecting health care.
84,74,I like to think that it's kind of weird that people think it's a good idea to wear a mask when they can't leave office.
93,84,">We just need to put some of the sexist masks on for people to wear... And we need to make sure people are wearing them because the other guy isn't wearing them""."
96,84,Vaccination is NOT required for everybody unless the person is in an advanced stage of a clinical trial.
84,7,"We're at an point in our lives where we cannot really be in the position we're in. This is what is at the heart of the health care debate here. We need to talk about vaccines and what the other guys are wearing, and the reasons they aren't in the position, and I'm afraid I haven't heard any good news for that either. If I were the President, I'd be able to talk about all the issues and the policies of the president in that area."
84,16,"I am a republican and I know a lot of people who think wearing a mask is a good idea if you don't like it when people don't think it's a good idea - but when it comes to health care and how people are treated, the truth is that I would be able to go with the one-liners."
84,17,"But what does ""Oh man I should come to Georgia... if it's not a mask"" mean?"
84,41,Is it because the president is wearing a mask to prevent him from being shot in the face? The guy doesn't.
84,48,A Republican doesn't really have the right to have a Republican party.
84,69,"This guy screams ""you're not a republican, you are a democratic Republican!"""
84,74,"This is pretty much how my friend worked in a restaurant where someone wore a mask, like the guy wearing a mask. Apparently he was wearing a mask to protect himself from being shot in the face, but didn't know he'd had the opportunity to do so when he got to the hospital in the first place."
93,84,"I don't think it's funny that people who voted to keep Obama on the white house, who are in Congress, have a right to be at least a little more vocal about it."
96,84,"I'm so sorry to say I was never aware that a virus has become so prevalent in the NFL for a while. Honestly, the thing that bothers me about the NHL is the amount of people in the world who don't know about it and can't think of a good reason not to get vaccinated. They're not going to know until after a few years. I mean, in fact, they are going to not know about it for a long while. I'm not sure why anyone would even consider the need to know about it?"
84,7,The issue is that people are still trying to convince the rest of us that a mask can protect themselves against the effects of a virus and that it is necessary to protect someone else who has already died or died of it.
84,16,"So, you are saying that the government should enact legislation to help prevent the spread of a virus?"
84,17,It's not that a guy wearing a mask would have an answer to you: it's like a person wearing a mask because they think it's a great idea and it's not necessarily a good one.
84,41,The president hasn't been doing much to get vaccinated.
84,48,"I don't know why someone would think of anything but ""We are not going to be able to make the call about getting vaccinated."""
84,69,Are you going to make an effort to change the law or get into the health care debate in a couple of years?
84,74,"Well, the president should wear his mask when he gets to his office to protect himself."
93,84,I think you're a bit off on this point.
96,84,"I have a great experience in the NFL. I've heard of a guy who said ""We need to be taught how to do it, and to use proper techniques."" And I still haven't gotten the CDC's help."
84,7,"I believe that this isn't a conservative problem. I do know that there are people in the world who think the president should be wearing a mask because he isn't sure what to do with it, but I'm sure that he's a good person and can use it against someone who's sick or dying. Isn't this just because of the fact that he is the only one who can actually visn't wear a mask when he's sick?"
84,16,That's a sarcastic question and I think that a lot of the skepticism that comes with the federal government's approach to protecting health care should be put to rest. I think that a lot of the skepticism that comes with the federal government's approach to protecting health care should be put to rest.
84,17,This is the first time I've heard of any CDC comment about this.
84,41,I am going to go with the one-liners.
84,48,"I wore a mask on my friend and we talked about it. It was a good idea, and a good idea for him, i.e. it was for the president. It also prevents them from trying to make money off a sick person and it was not like they had been in the hospital when it happened, or at least it was not."
84,69,I have no idea how this is even possible. I want to talk about vaccines and the other guys are wearing them.
84,74,"""I think it s pretty much weird that people think it s a good idea to wear a mask when they can't leave office."""
93,84,> We just need to put some of the sexist masks on for people to wear... And we need to make sure people are wearing them because the other guy isn't wearing them.
96,84,And that's why the team is trying to change.
84,7,It seems that the government is trying to influence the situation but doesn't have enough support for a system where people can wear whatever they want.
84,16,I don't get that any of these are the most popular comments.
84,17,It seems like someone who is an idiot is actually trying to give a good answer to this and isn't doing anything to change the law.
84,41,", ""'s just a good idea, and a good idea to prevent a person from being shot in the face? The guy doesn't."", ""'s just a good idea, and a good idea to prevent a person from being shot in the face? The guy doesn't."", ""'s just a good idea, and a good idea to prevent a person from being shot in the face? The guy doesn't."""
84,48,What a dick joke!
84,69,"i've never heard that one, but it is a bit weird that people think that the government should enact legislation to help prevent the spread of a virus"
84,74,I'm a guy who goes to college and plays baseball for a large company and can say a lot about how they see it when they go. There's also no denying that they know more than the President. The president should wear a mask when he goes to work. He should be allowed to wear it when he goes to work. He should have a right to know. The president is a skeptic that the government doesn't care. The government should stop going after sick people by making them sick a mask.
93,84,"Whether or not you would be a Republican, the whole political landscape would be different. The presidents are a nutjob. What if he were a nutjob?"
96,84,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
84,7,This is how sexist is a troll!
84,16,People will wear them to protest the lack of adequate medical care. Whether it be a cancer or a blood disease?
84,17,"It would have to be to stop all use of a mask for anyone, especially a guy who's not a big fan of the idea of ""in a mask"". ""If it was me I would wear a mask but if it wasn't the best option to get rid of my mask I could never take it off myself""."
84,41,The CDC does not have enough authority in the U.S. government to be able to say that people should wear masks when they see the illness.
84,48,This is why we can't have a president in power. That's why our elected officials are elected. I'm not a guy.
84,69,"I'm an American. I can tell you a lot about the CDC and that my husband has his face plastered on every office, but at least he has a lot of information on vaccines."
84,74,"I think the question was ""is it possible that the president will wear a mask?"""
93,84,This is not a joke. It is the ad hominem of a sexist stereotype. This is a fact.
96,84,This seems like a legitimate problem for the NFL.
84,7,"""The president is wearing a mask in the us to help stop the spread of a virus."
84,16,"It's a bit bizarre, but that's the type of shit we're talking about."
84,17,"I was just thinking that if you don't like them, then maybe you should."
84,41,>We just need to put some of the sexist masks on for people to wear...
84,48,"What if you get a flu like me, but are you not an Obama."
84,69,"The article states that the CDC is the primary government agency. The president has a 'no control over healthcare policy'. Its a huge mistake to use this to protect the health of everyone. Its also a very good idea to not keep people in a hospital for a long time, and therefore prevent the spread of a virus. It is not an official policy or official mandate for any person."
84,74,A lot of things that are a common thought are:
93,84,"The entire topic of the discussion is not a joke, it's just a joke. And I'm going to repeat this: ""[Do you think the entire problem about the Obama administration is a joke, or does the Obama administration take a joke about it? "")"
96,84,"It has no bearing on the fact that the NFL is on the verge of a national sceptic disorder, and a lack of support. It's just not that good. The NFL is a crappy organization, but the way they handle it is the same."
84,7,"That was kind of the point. I mean, I'd be a lot more open about not going to the stadium with the mask."
84,16,"The joke is, because we are a racist organization."
84,17,The president is wearing a mask in the us to help stop the spread of a virus.
84,41,"It seems like the CDC is one of the largest organizations in the world that have come up with this ""obvious problem"". Basically, there are other things going on in the world that are 'debatable'."
84,48,This guy makes it sound like he isn't really the president.
84,69,"I think the issue here is that the NFL is on the verge of a national sceptic disorder, and a lack of support. It's just not that good. The NFL is a crappy organization, but the way they handle it is the same."
84,74,The President is wearing a mask to stop the spread of a virus.
93,84,This is very interesting. You've taken the right place.
96,84,The government is doing a pretty good job of preventing the spread of the virus.
84,7,"The point of the article is ""[Do you think the entire topic of the discussion is a joke, or does the Obama administration take a joke about it?]"
84,16,It's a joke.
84,17,That's a pretty good question. You've taken the right place. The government is doing a pretty good job of preventing the spread of the virus.
84,41,The CDC is not a sexist organization. Its a crappy organization.
84,48,The whole issue is that we can't afford it and we can't afford it. We can't afford it. It's not a joke. The federal government can't afford it.
84,69,The president doesn't even have to wear a mask. He is trying to keep the healthcare system healthy.
84,74,"If the president was a skeptic about the government, he should be a skeptic, as is my theory."
93,84,"> The joke is that ""I'm not a nutjob, I'm a nutjob. And he just likes to talk about nutjobs as a political insult. I think the best idea to do this is to have a mask on. But you're right it's not an ad hominem, but you should say that ""smoking nutjob"" has been a joke for a while. I really think it's the best way to do it."

84,69,"I've always liked the first comment. I don't agree with it because it's very offensive, but I find that more effective than the last is to use a mask in public to prevent outbreaks. It seems like the mask is a good way to prevent a virus outbreak and is a good way to stop the spread of a virus."

If the president was a skeptic about the government, he should be a skeptic, as is my theory."
84,17,It's a good joke that was made by an American politician and a conservative.

But at the same time, the government would be more concerned about the problem of having a ""one"" vaccine than the NFL."
84,7,They don't need to wear a mask to stop the spread of viruses.
84,16,I have heard it described a bit of a joke. Like a good joke.

84,41,It would be too funny to have the president wearing a mask and having the CDC do the job for him instead of for people.
84,48,It sounds like the media has already made the president and the president's position in the white house sound worse than the Republican leadership.
84,69,"I don't see how this would help save the government's image, but I don't think this will change a lot in the future."
84,74,You are thinking of the idea of the President wearing a mask when he goes to work. He should be allowed to wear a mask when he goes to work. But is there a premise for this?
93,84,"Well he does seem like a fairly logical, and rational person. I think it's funny the way the President does, but he does seem pretty egocentric. It's not a joke, it's more of a joke. It's a joke."
96,84,It's also sad that there is such a big lack of respect for the NFL.

93,84,"There's no such thing as a joke. It's a joke, and a joke. I think it is a joke, and a joke."
96,84,I'd be more concerned about what other people think of the NFL.
84,7,"Well, this article says that he is still getting on the ""coin of fear"" with his comment about the president and not slandering the situation, and that it's just being a sarcastic and wacky joke."
84,16,"... that's really scary fucking question, and that's not the right answer. I think that a lot of the skepticism that comes with the federal government's approach to protecting health care should be put to rest."
84,17,The CDC should be allowed to wear a mask to help stop the spread of the virus.
84,41,This is a very good point.

84,17,"This is a joke that is more about the President wearing a mask than the President doing the whole ""stop the spread of the virus"" thing."
84,41,The title has a bit of a catch. That the president should put on a mask because he's a skeptic is wrong. The CDC does have authority in the U.S. government to be able to say that people should wear a mask to prevent the spread of the virus.
84,48,"The guy who made a joke about the president and it wasn't a joke, but I'm sure it's a joke that the joke is funny?"

96,84,What's the point of using a mask that prevents spread of a virus? It sounds like someone else is just throwing in their narcissism to help them.
84,7,"I was asked to respond to a joke about someone who was arguing that the president is not the only president to wear a mask, and that he should have some sort of mask to protect him from being shot in the face."
84,16,"I don't know what it means to be a senator, but there is a lot more than a joke : it sounds like people are in the middle of trying to have their own opinion about the health care situation. The person is not the one to tell the joke. They are the one to make the joke. The person that is a skeptic about the government does not need to be able to have a presidential office."
84,17,"I've heard that ""The president is wearing a mask to help stop the spread of the virus."" Is that not a joke?"
84,41,"I don't know if you have this conversation, but it's been in your head for a long time."

84,16,"This is a r/employee issue, and the whole idea of it is to make a political joke about the president of the United States. The president of Georgia and the CDC have been in the position for quite some time, but it seems the current administration doesn't feel that way about it."

84,41,"It is a joke. It is a joke, and it has no bearing on the issue. It is a joke."

84,17,It was a great idea and a good joke. It's also about people wearing a mask and the government in order to fight the viral outbreak. That's a joke. It's actually funny because the CDC doesn't put a mask on a civilian who has had their hands shaved in the past. It's just a joke about a white guy who is not in the national spotlight.
