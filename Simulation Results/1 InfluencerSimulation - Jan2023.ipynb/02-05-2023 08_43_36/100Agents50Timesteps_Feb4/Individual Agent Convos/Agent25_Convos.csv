27,25,It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
35,25,[NAME] is a national tv series. They want to teach their young kids about how they'll do it in order to prevent spreading the virus. Is this the way it works?
36,25,I was just chatting with a bunch of guys I knew who were not wearing a mask. I was also trying to find out if they were actually going to get sick by wearing a mask on them. Then they showed up for the drive-up and I tried to try it on myself and I couldn't get sick.
55,25,"Wearing a mask helps in stopping the spread of the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
68,25,Does it say she is wearing a mask or is she wearing a mask? Or is it the same thing as the other posters saying it.

25,6,This makes me think about the President. I'm going to go with him as to why he must wear a mask. That's crazy!
25,8,"When I was a teenager my mom wore a mask when she visited her cousin, and then she tried to wear a mask because she was not a very good nurse."
25,11,"And if you don't know why, don't you? Is wearing a mask to prevent spread of a virus part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus?"
25,22,The CDC has an insanity measure designed by the government to make it easier to find someone with the virus and find out what it is.
27,25,As an old man who wears a mask every day I can imagine that if the other person was a victim of a mental health disorder he would be a terrible victim. I think it is a good idea to use a mask for protection.
35,25,"You have to realize this, and you are trying to make fun of it. You don't like wearing a mask to prevent a virus, that's you."
36,25,i'm from a senile state and i've never done that :) i'm going to say this about twitchcon and masks you can hate me if the state town doesn't have an mandates you can't get mad that an event doesn't have any mandates as a senile person with boosters :) I am a big fan of this but in order to prevent transmission I have to have a mask on. You need to get your head around a lot of people on a medical scale 
55,25,"In the U.S. the word ""fake"" comes from ""fake."" If you don't like it, go to a different school, go to a different college, and go through a new university, you can eat a few good pizzas and eat a few of these pizzas. Then you'll get fake. It has no value, no useful benefits, nothing."

27,25,"I've been on the opposite side of this for 6 years, and I never wore a mask outside of the party, only a couple of times a week. There's no sense to being a mask at all. I wear a mask every single day and I have never had an accident or illness. I don't like it at all."
35,25,I think they are trying to teach their children to do something to prevent spreading of the virus. Is this the way it works?
36,25,"You're right it does not help, it's useless and I hate it."
55,25,I think a lot of people have had a bad experience with a mask and that was what they thought when they read it. Then there are people who aren't aware of the importance of the mask because of their inability to tell if they're infected with the virus.
68,25,"I think this is a valid question, but I think the fact that the player isn't wearing a mask is what you're getting at, which isn't so stupid."

55,25,"I don't think it's an easy task to get people to think that a mask is going to help prevent spread of a virus, or even prevent the spread of it. I don't think it's really necessary."
68,25,I think he is trying to get a piece of shit out of this. A lot of his work is just trying to get it done and then some. The ad just says she was wearing a mask because he had a gun and it got smashed. That's not a good fit to wear.

I do wear one though because he's an alcoholic and he thinks he doesn't really likes it, but that's not"

25,5,"People that believe that the mask is an effective prevention tool aren't going to learn to accept a solution, but if they think it's not enough they probably will accept the CDC and will refuse to recognize it as a valid means of treatment. It might be a sexist tactic. But that's what it's supposed to be referring to: how people who wear a mask are actually treated in the US, not the other way around."
25,6,"The AMA is a joke... Apparently, a prank like this is something that is common in the military."
25,8,"I’m not a lawyer. I can only assume the EPA has a monopoly in healthcare in the US. The other issues are, of course, being a joke based on the government’s “discussion” of a vaccine. If he wants to use the mask to protect against the virus, he wants the government to make a deal with him and take care of this as a way to get things done. He just wants to prevent anyone from spreading it."
25,11,There is a big controversy in the US with that mask.

36,25,"I was wearing one as a child, and I have no idea what the problem is. But it was a joke. I could not stand that people were not going to use it, so I was so incredibly nervous to try it on myself. It was one of the worst things I've ever done. The EPA was not going to admit that their behavior was wrong, but apparently they should have kept them on the side of the people."

68,25,I don't think the military would be doing anything about this. It's more that they wouldn't actually get involved because they have to worry about making the players feel uncomfortable or insecure about making a joke based on something not very relevant. I think the CDC could find another way to take the matter out of the war and get him into it.

25,11,"The article is really funny. It’s funny to me that people are being a dick about wearing a mask. Honestly, I was going to say it."
25,22,I was at the hospital with my husband and two kids when this occurred. I think that was the joke that had to be made.
27,25,"I'm a little dick. I think it's more of a joke, or at least a joke to be able to put on a mask."

25,1,I don't think it's a joke.
25,3,"It's very easy to see that a doctor does not even give a medical opinion and a skunk is getting sick. I'd be surprised if the government actually did. They have a really good reason to believe that they are not being the most effective, which they should."

25,5,This is one of the greatest things to happen in life.
25,6,A prank like this is common in the military. A prank like this is something that is common in the military.
25,8,My guess is that the problem is the CDC isn't even putting them in place and that you don't know enough about them to know what is going on with your skunk.
25,11,I think the article is a bit funny.
25,22,Well it’s just really funny. The people that comment on this are actually hating on the government for not removing the CDC’s 'emergency' of preventing this from happening.

74,25,I think this is an old joke because of the 'honest question' we get here.

25,11,I'd have to do a little more research on how the EPA is going to sue them and how it will effect them if this person is not getting the treatment they need.
25,22,The joke is not a joke.

36,25,"So, the idea of a mask is like a joke, but the idea of a hat isn't funny?"
55,25,The fact that it is a joke makes it more of a prank. It's more like someone jerking off and trying to make a joke about a group of kids who don't know they can get a good crowbar without having a face in their mouth. It's not the same as people getting a bad face in a fight against an epidemic that's a joke. It's the idea of the crowbar and the whole concept of being a joke.

72,25,I have to say that the fact that Obama has put the law in place to stop skunks in his AMA is a bit misleading.
74,25,I gotta say that the joke that they're making isn't a joke. They're trying to make it a joke because a mask is not something that people are comfortable wearing. There is no problem with that. But it makes you uncomfortable. The only way to prevent people from getting sick is to get vaccinated because they can afford to do it.
89,25,"I've always sat on a blackboard to show how conservative the Democratic party is and how they support their agenda in the form of bigotry, and I couldn't agree more.

25,4,This sounds so familiar. Is the word a prank?
25,5,The way this is thrown around here is that a mask is a joke. There is no such thing as a'serious' joke. I think it's silly and not really a joke.
25,6,"I would imagine that the president could wear a mask in a very casual way. In the real world, a mask will only make people uncomfortable in a way that is eerily similar to that of a face mask. You would feel like the person would have some sort of 'northern' dreadlock to distract them."

27,25,The ACA has a bad record and a lot of people are ill.
35,25,The Obama ACA isn't a joke. There is a joke that the CDC isn't making the ACA a joke.
36,25,There is a lot of negative news about the EPA. The only thing that I see is that people are being harmed by a mask.

So I'm not sure if this is a cliche or a joke. The difference between a joke and a joke is that it isn't a joke. But if it's a joke then it's a joke."""
72,25,It's a nutjob joke. The guy who wrote the AMA is referring to a skunk guy who is still going to die without the help of a mask. The article goes on to say the EPA and NRA have no authority to change the health care system. They have been trying to get the U.S. government to do everything they can to help. It's just a joke.
74,25,"Vaccines aren’t even legal anymore. They’re not going to help combat the spread. It’s not in the context of the article, it’s the context of a post. Vaccines aren’t even legal anymore.

74,25,I'm a republican who thinks the joke is about the government trying to make a law that prevents people from getting sick from wearing masks.
89,25,"I know what you mean. The jokes about the people who are actually on the issue are ridiculous. I can't imagine a doctor who can't wear a mask on a regular basis. They're not really a joke about a virus that's just a common occurrence in public - it's just a joke a person could be doing, and they're not in a position to smear the government."

25,22,I think this has to do with the fact that it was a joke. I do not understand how this joke could be a prank. It's not a joke.

They don't want people to be able to see a mask that they would have been wearing. They haven't got
36,25,It's very interesting and I don't have a lot of information on the issue. It's a very vague and interesting topic but I think it is worth being aware of. It is a nutjob joke.

68,25,It's a joke. And the joke isn't funny.
72,25,"I like all the comments. It's a bit of a joke. Is there a place where it's a joke, or is it just a joke. It's not about the ACA. It's about the people who don't care about it. They don't care about it. It's about the people who do care about it. It's about the people who know better."
74,25,"I'd like to point out that the only good thing about a mask is that it makes people uncomfortable in their room, so it becomes like the ol''fucking shit.

25,5,I think a joke is more than just a joke. It's not a joke.

25,11,"I think it was one of the reasons the AMA was created. Those people wore a mask to protect themselves from AIDS, because it was a joke and that the AMA was an attempt to help people who didn’t wear a mask. It was one of the reasons they wanted to push to protect themselves and the people who had been in the CDC since their days."
25,22,The wording here is prickly and obnoxious. The first line just sounds like a joke.
27,25,That's because a person like you would not have to wear a mask to be able to protect themselves.
35,25,"The ACA was passed in 2005, and many people did not vote against it. Now it is in effect. It's actually not a joke at all, and it's not very funny. It is very well documented that AIDS does not exist. I don't really think it's an ACA joke unless you really have a very good sense of humor. The ACA was passed in 2010 and that was because of a partisan conspiracy that was actually a joke. It has been passed many times. This isn't a joke."

27,25,I believe that the government is trying to get a better response to a joke to keep it out of the mainstream. That's why some people are going to eat their way out of it.

36,25,"I'm afraid you don't know. You can't take advantage of a hat on a job that you think you're a racist, especially if it's to protect yourself against the government trying to get you into a fight for your health."
55,25,Is it a joke that people in a group who do not believe what they are seeing are getting a skunk in their body?
68,25,What kind of a joke? The only one that actually makes sense to me is that it is a joke - a joke about a government in a war-- that can be funny.

35,25,"This is going to be funny. The CDC should tell you what the ACA is, but I don't see that going out of the way to try and stop the spread. That's a joke to tell you what the government needs to do to stop this."

27,25,"In addition to what people are saying in the article, I've also heard the quote, ""If you want a better response to a joke because it's a joke, I'm going to assume that some of the jokes in the article are from conservatives or evangelicals."
35,25,They're also telling the story of how this man wants his son to be taught how to protect his children from the spread of the virus by telling him to keep his head up and not put on his mask.
36,25,The whole thing is so ridiculous.
55,25,"[It's a joke. I'm not a troll, but I am a professor.](http://www.reddit.com/r/RaisingTheSavages.htm) (http://www.reddit.com/r/RaisingTheSavages.htm) (http://www.reddit.com/r/RaisingTheSavages.htm) (http://www.reddit.com/RaisingTheSavages.ht"
68,25,"""The only person who can get vaccinated is a person in the NHL who has a mask. I think that's funny because it makes me feel uncomfortable or insecure."""
72,25,It's the best case scenario where someone will stop doing something about something that isn't the ACA. They are going to be sued because of it.
74,25,We need a solution that works in the context of this thread:
89,25,"That’s very true. Vaccination is not a joke. It’s a joke. The problem is the joke, but it is an issue. People are sick, the government is smearing the health and safety of the public, and people are not making fun of it."
25,1,“But you're right in saying that the joke is a joke because they are trying to get the government to do everything they can to help. They are trying to make it illegal.”
25,3,"You do the right thing, you are not the one that has a problem with your government. It's not a joke. It's a prank. I'm not even going to budge on this one. It's going to be a prank because you're trying to tell people something that's not the AMA, but to make people laugh or to be funny and make them laugh."
25,4,"(http://www.reddit.com/r/RaisingTheSavages.htm)(http://www.reddit.com/r/RaisingTheSavages.htm). [I don’t think it’s funny, but it’s a joke. The problem is the problem is the joke, but it is an issue. People are sick, the government is smearing the health and safety of the public, and people are not making fun of this."
25,5,Vaccination is not legally illegal in Texas. They're not even legally legal anymore. They're not going to help combat the spread. The ACA and the military aren't a good place to start.
25,6,It's an unpopular opinion. I think a lot of people aren't happy about that.
25,8,">He is the president who wants to help people find a job, but he wants to make a deal with him and take care of this as a way to get things done."
25,11,"It's a joke. This is the kind of stuff that makes the best AMAs. It's a joke. The whole thing is so funny. It's not just the ACA that is the joke. It's a joke, of course. ''Well I'm going to tell you the truth, I just want to get downvoted for thinking it's not funny at all. The headline isn't funny, of course. It's a joke because the headline isn't funny at all."
25,22,The problem with the joke is that the article is referencing the ACA.
27,25,"I don't really want to be a politician, but hey. I am sure you are on a good day."
35,25,"It's been around for about four years. The ACA is not a joke, it's a joke. It's a joke."
36,25,"CANNOTANSWER'S PERSON HAS LOST ENTIRE DEAD SHOTS OF PARTS OF THE CDC. It seems a lot of people on here in the past and a lot of people who are aware of what is being said about people wearing a hat, but the guy told me that it's illegal to wear a hat. It's a joke because people are taking advantage of it to protect themselves. 'Is the idea of a hat like a joke?"
55,25,"""But they don't want to change the health care system."""
68,25,The joke is about how the NFL wants to stop the spread of a virus.
72,25,"I am not a lawyer and can not support these lawsuits. I don't know what to say to the AMAs, but I agree with them."
74,25,"The people on this sub are not really talking about the ACA. They are talking about how it isn’t a joke, but that the president is naughty."
89,25,The government is not in charge of vaccines.
25,1,"Vaccination is illegal in most countries, but the AMA isn't really a joke because it's being made up."
25,3,"I cant remember which one, but I do remember it's not illegal to get a hat. Unless someone was trying to get a vaccine. I'm not sure what your point is. I just remembered that because of the way the article was written, that it wasn't illegal to get a hat. If people wear hats like that, the joke won't be a prank, but it's a joke. I'm not sure if anyone has said anything about the ACA or whether or not, but this was a prank"
25,4,"I’m not really a pro skunk, but I think the entire article is a joke."
25,5,">''(http://www.reddit.com/r/RaisingTheSavages.htm)"""
25,6,"I see a lot of interesting comments here on the AMA thread, but I'm still very much confused about the other AMA posts and the one about how ACA is illegal."
25,8,"I’m a young woman living in a wheelchair and a big medical bills are being paid on a daily basis in the form of a personal health insurance policy. If someone does this to me, I get paid to make them stop. Its just that it’s a joke and it’s not a joke that anyone would be hurt by."
25,11,I am going to try to explain this to people:
25,22,"The question is, how do we deal with this?"
27,25,>What's it about the ACA that is being used? The AMA was the only one that popped into my head.
35,25,I feel like the first time we read the article was about a prank about the ACA that was made by the government to prevent spreading of AIDS.
36,25,I don't know if that makes sense. That's a lot of hats. I do not think they can be worn when it's needed in emergencies. It's a hat.
55,25,"It's a joke. It's not a prank, but it's a joke."
68,25,"Yes, if you can't get yourself in to the gym, you're not going to get vaccinated. Then, if you can't get out of the gym and use a mask, you're not going to get into a lot of trouble for being in the gym all the time. You're a hater, if you can get out of the gym, you're going to have a fucking problem."
72,25,"I see what you're saying, but I'm not going to argue that the whole ""I hate you"" joke is wrong."
74,25,"The article states that ""I would like to point out that the only good thing about a mask is that it makes a lot of people uncomfortable in their room, so it becomes like the ol''fucking shit."
89,25,"It's not a joke, it's a joke."
25,1,"In the US it is illegal to wear a mask in public because it is so uncomfortable in the room that it's so dangerous to the human body. It's a joke because it makes the other side feel so uncomfortable, but it's a joke because it makes it sound like it isn't. It's also illegal for people to wear a mask in public if they do not have the proper protection."
25,3,The AMA isn't a joke. It's a prank.
25,4,", 'I don't think it's illegal for someone who doesn't know what a mask is called, to wear it at an event.'"
25,5,It's not illegal. Its a joke. It's a joke.
25,6,"This is not a prank, and it is illegal in Florida."
25,8,I'm an immigrant from the United States and I would like to add to this:
25,11,"As the guy who wrote ""'I'm just a little bit of a racist nut who thinks a mask is the best way to protect myself from a virus"" [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/relationships/famous-govt-choice/comments/r/Relationships/doctor-the-huffington-post)](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/"
25,22,The first sentence just sounds like a joke. The second line sounds like a joke.
27,25,The problem is the government is trying to make it a joke that is absurd.
35,25,Why do you think the article is a joke? Because you want to be a joke?
36,25,"""Is the EPA going to stop a viral attack on me?"""
55,25,"The fact that they use sexist words like ""terrorist"" or ""terrorist"" to get rid of a bad situation is not a joke. They just use the word ""terrorist"" as a slur."
68,25,"""Fascinating jokes like this are only a joke. There is no reason why you can't get vaccinated. In the US, vaccinating a person, and not getting a new mask, is a minor crime. There is absolutely no reason why a mask should be a crime in a country."""
72,25,"[What the AMA is referring to is misleading and misleading], but I don't think he is in any of those positions."
74,25,"''Then, we need to find the best way to do this.'''"
89,25,"I don't think you are serious about this, but you are not a doctor."
25,1,"I don't know if I'd get a good laugh out of wearing a mask in public as I'm a racist, but I don't know if there's something to be said in this article that would make the entire thing a joke."
25,3,“I don’t think this is a joke. Because I’ve seen a lot of people that believe that it’s a joke”
25,4,I believe the AMA is a joke because people do not have the requisite insurance coverage. They are just making a joke that's based on real facts.
25,5,"The ACA is still illegal. They are not going to allow the government to protect other people. I’m going to fucking say they want to stop a joke, but they are a joke and they want to get into trouble."
25,6,"I would say it's a joke because it makes people uncomfortable. I'm not a liberal, but I think the AMA is a joke because of it. I think it's a joke because it's funny because it makes people uncomfortable. I think it's funny because it makes people uncomfortable. In my view, it's funny because it makes people uncomfortable. In my view, it's a joke."
25,8,CANNOTANSWER:
25,11,What's the point? It's a joke. It's not a joke.
25,22,"They're all for the government. It's a joke. There is no reason to go outside, even if you don't have a vaccinated person. And it is illegal. In the USA, a vaccinated person is not a member of a government. There is no reason for them not to be in a position that isn't vaccinated. Those people do not have the appropriate protection from the government."
27,25,"OP's response to that is that it's just a joke. ""It's a joke because it's the government's job to stop the spread of a virus. Vaccination isn't a joke."""
35,25,CANNOTANSWER: 'Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
36,25,"I mean, I'm not a racist, but I'm not a racist, or any of the other people."
55,25,I don't care if it makes you happy or not.
68,25,I think the most significant part of this joke is that he has the chance of being arrested for something he did not get. And it's not a joke because he doesn't have the chance to prove anything
72,25,> The only way to get the public to learn about this is to write a AMA.
74,25,I'm going to be in the midst of a discussion on how to prevent the spread of a virus.
89,25,There is a problem with people not knowing how to make a joke about someone not being able to use a mask. That is what the nutjob joke is about.
