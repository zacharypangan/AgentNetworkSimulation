55,27,This is actually a good place to point out the government has a mandate to protect.
55,33,Wearing a mask to prevent a virus will definitely make you sick.
55,46,"No, it's not a problem. The government is acting as if it are the people making the jokes and people will tell you how it is being done. They can t be bothered to take it to the police and they cant."
55,48,">I know this. It's not a big deal, but it's not the government's job to make this a problem. It's one of the few times the government is being able to make something of it, but that is it."
60,55,I can't imagine the idea that you can make a joke with anyone that doesn't think they're actually aware that wearing a mask is not to reduce the spread of a virus. It's very similar to why you should eat some of the meat you like.
61,55,The government is trying to influence the public to come up with an ACA to stop the spread of a virus and that's just trying to get people to come up with ACA to end the issue. There's a problem with the government.

79,55,It sounds to me like the government is using a mask to stop the spread of a virus.
85,55,I think Trump and the US are the greatest politicians in the world.
89,55,"Yes. People in the US can wear a mask, even with their noses and shoulders down. If it is used on someone for a sick person (and only in their eye sockets), they're ok. And it's not just a mask for the job. You don't need a mask, you have to wear a mask."
91,55,"So, here I am. Using the word ""Skunk"" here, people defending the word ""skunk"" are actually being able to say some sort of rebuttal."
92,55,People will be fired for refusing to wear a mask. They aren't allowed to do so. They aren't being fired because of the health and safety implications.
96,55,Are you a lawyer? It's really the only way you can stop being an asshole.
98,55,"What's funny is that he's also wearing his mask. This makes me rethink my whole view on things. Apparently that's what the guy is doing. There's a bit of a tidbit of humor in the movie. That's ok, but it's a joke, IMO."
101,55,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
55,11,"In America, most of these things aren't a joke. Usually, the joke is just about the fact that the government is trying to get the people to do what they want."
55,14,"The ""skunk"" part is an unnecessarily ridiculous claim that the government is taking an interest in helping protect people, thereby not getting any evidence to change the subject. It's not really a good point for you, but it is a very funny point to make."

60,55,"I'm a doctor who was a medical professor. Basically, a mask is a safety precaution and in a way, it is a joke. And the article says ""You shouldn't wear a mask as much as you want"" and people should be told to ""wear it as much as you want."""
61,55,"I was able to have a good time with a friend of mine who was on the bus to TWitchCon, but we had no choice but to not make it to a TWitchCon."
71,55,The first one I read is about Georgia.
79,55,I don't know why CDC is making fun of the government's use of a mask
85,55,>We're wearing a mask.
89,55,I didn't think it was a joke that this was about Obama in 2012...
91,55,CANNOTANSWER (https://twitchesnet.com/news/nfl_context_report.htm)
92,55,It's not a joke.
96,55,"I mean, they didn't make the mask on the players and they did the job. It isn't a mask."
98,55,"The whole thing, while it is funny, is completely false."
101,55,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
55,11,Is this the stuff that people get so mad when they say... no... the government is making fun of it and that it's not even funny? No.
55,14,"The government is using the term ""terrorist"" as a slur, supposedly. It's not the ""terrorist"" or ""skunk"" thing, but the joke part, presumably."
55,16,"""Hey, I can't believe in the truth."""
55,19,"“I mean, they didn't make the mask on the players and they did the job. It isn't a mask. The whole thing, while it is funny, is completely false. Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
55,20,CANNOTANSWER. I’m also a medical professor.
55,25,"A skunk doesn't need a mask to stop it. A skunk needs the chance to stop it, and in a sense it does help prevent it from spreading."
55,27,"There's a lot of misconception about the issue here, but I can give a better explanation of the point. The joke was probably made up by the federal government. So that's why I believe in it. I don't care what your sentiment is but I want to thank you for bringing up this topic."

55,46,"I'm going to go read this article as the only person who has said that I know nothing about scavenger hunting, and I am pretty sure he will cite this article."
55,48,"No, no, no, no, no, I'm not a nerd, I wear a mask for my body and I am not a nerd. I'm not a nerd."
60,55,Because it's a joke.
61,55,"Despite what you're doing, i think the ACA is the best plan in the history of healthcare for the next 50 years. It's not a joke and doesn't exist for everyone. It is a good plan."
71,55,I have a feeling this is a good response to this...
79,55,"My point is that the government is a prank, because the government is doing it to make fun of the government. I don't think it's funny. It's not funny."
85,55,"This isn't a joke. It's a joke that makes it to an end. ""An idea is a hypothesis""."
89,55,I think you're being sarcastic.
91,55,The article goes on to state that the EPA and NRA have no authority to change the health care system... But that’s probably why it’s a big problem.
92,55,"People are not being sexist, not for that matter."
96,55,"Yes, I would think that a ""sad"" issue is a ""sad"" issue."
98,55,"It's not a joke, it's a joke."
101,55,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
55,11,"You could say that because there are many ad hominem jokes here, but i also can't think of any that are really funny."
55,14,The ACA was created as a way to discourage people from carrying diseases and protecting themselves.
55,16,It sounds like the only way for Obama to have a fight for the ACA is to change the medical system.
55,19,"This is a joke. No, no, no, I'm a doctor and I don't really believe in a mask. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. No, no, no. It's a joke. It's a joke."
55,20,"You are not the only one who said this! I mean, I have to be very sure that the ACA was a joke. It's a good plan, a joke and a joke. It doesn't make sense if the government is doing it to make fun of the government."
55,25,I'm pretty sure this isn't what the article referred to.
55,27,The first one says they don't need to put a mask on in order to stop the spread. They are using it as a slur. The second one says that it is useless.
55,33,"That's kind of like when a woman tries to say ""I'm allergic to this stuff"". It's not even the joke. It's more like if she was getting sick in the face of a bullet. Then she reacted on something else to that. Then she cried and left. So you're still the one saying this, smh."
55,46,"The article isn't a joke. It's just a joke, and a big rant about the government. The joke was probably made up by the federal government."
55,48,"RIP, the people who have their nose cut off, the people who have their mouth cut off, the people who have their nose cut off, the people who have their nose cut off, the people who have their nose cut off, and the people who have their nose cut off."
60,55,I don't think the whole point of the mask is that it is a joke. It's a joke. People shouldn't wear a mask if they feel uncomfortable.
61,55,The ACA is a scam. People will be going to the CDC and trying to get vaccinations. This is a serious scam that no one in the country wants to see.
71,55,"In Georgia, you can use the words “if I’m a sailor” to mean “sailor.”"
79,55,I can't get a decent mask unless I wear a mask or a jar for scavenger hunts. I don't get that in this context.
85,55,> The whole thing is about the government invading people
89,55,"So the president is a joke, isn't he?"
91,55,"It's not about the government's ability to change the health care system, but rather, about the fact that they're trying to change the health care system. This isn't about what's happening, the article's about what's going on."
92,55,You're so stupid. The fact you're the one that is just as sexist as Donald J. Trump is an insult that isn't even funny. You have no idea how to talk about it.
96,55,"You've been told that there is a big issue with infield helmets. This is a huge issue with health care. We do have a govt mandate that helps protect us against the spread of disease. I don't think we're going to see that if there's not a mandate, we should not be forced to wear masks."
98,55,You mean the fact that the article is about Donald J. Trump wearing a mask to stop the spread of a virus?
101,55,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
55,11,i have no idea what you mean by a joke
55,14,"""...you don't think they are going to change the subject because they are unable to get their own health insurance."""
55,16,"I'd like to say that the fact that wearing a mask would be a joke isn't the whole point of this discussion. The president is a joke about the government, he's trying to make fun of it. RIP, the people who have their nose cut off, the people who have their mouth cut off, the people who have their nose cut off, the people who have their nose cut off, the people who have their nose cut off, the people who have their nose cut off, and the people who have their nose cut off."
55,19,"This is a joke, it's a slur. A joke. It's a joke."
55,20,"As an adult, I always wanted to wear the mask. But I didn't, so I didn't, so I'd say I was okay with it and not that they're the only ones trying to rename it."
55,25,There is no way that a skunk can be safe and have a mask on it if the health care system is to protect itself. The ACA is a prank. The ACA is a joke and it is a joke.
55,27,"... and the fact that we can't do it. You know, a joke."
55,33,... and then you talk to the man in the red.
55,46,"This is what sucks, isn't it? I get that the government isn't doing it for its own agenda, because they want to prevent that."
55,48,">I mean, I'm a doctor and I don't really believe in a mask. It sounds like the only way for Obama to have a fight for the ACA is to change the medical system."
60,55,"Well, I know a lot of people who wear the mask to save them from infection, but I think there aren't any that are trying to make the jokes out of any of them. It seems like the article is just an attempt to make a joke for the sake of the AMA."
61,55,This sounds like a really really interesting conversation. What the fuck is that?
71,55,"I like the idea of the word ""sailor"" which is used as an example of how the government cannot be trusted."
79,55,"No, not at all. This is just a prank."
85,55,"""I'm a doctor and I don't know about the AIDS vaccine, but I am an anti-vaccine doctor and the only part of the conversation I would have had was for people to be infected (i.e. if it's possible for people to get infected) while wearing a mask."""
89,55,A Republican senator is a joke.
91,55,>Why does the NRA want to change the health care system?

96,55,If this is a major issue in healthcare policy the NFL will definitely have a big problem with masks.
98,55,The first one I'm going to re-read is a joke.
101,55,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
55,11,"I know how to be a joke about what I see coming out of the blue. I don't know if anyone here has heard of a person feigning panic or anxiety when they think they're being taken advantage of, but I'd probably like a post like this in the AMA, and a whole lot of stuff I'm trying to think is a joke."
55,14,"This is a joke. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."""
55,16,People wear masks because they get sick.
55,19,"There are a lot of issues with the ACA, and not much of them are really going to change. It's not like people who want to wear the mask to save themselves is the same as being infected while wearing the mask."
55,20,"'The only thing that has ever gotten in the way of a good joke is to not use them to stop the spread of a virus.""...you don't think they are going to change the subject because they are unable to get their own health insurance."""
55,25,"""Why does the NRA want to change the health care system?"""
55,27,A joke. A joke. That's not a joke.
55,33,"I don't know what the issue is, but I think you're right. If they were saying anything, they'd probably be asking about this."
55,46,"""This is a joke, a joke. The government is trying to tell you to stop wearing a mask. The issue is not that they are trying to prevent a virus, it's that they are taking steps to stop it from spreading."" ""The issue is not that they are trying to prevent a virus, it's that they are taking steps to stop it from spreading."""
55,48,"No, the government isn't. They want to have a fight."
60,55,"Aside from being funny, I've seen this article about people putting a mask on their friends for fun, just for fun."
61,55,I want to help you out because this is one of my favorite posts of the day. I can't believe I've never seen a post where a guy made a joke about how the president was trying to force people to go to TWitchCon without their vaccinations.
71,55,/r/RaisingtheSavages is a good subreddit for all things government. I’m trying to get this to you but I think that’s really important.
79,55,I feel like I may have made an excellent point but I don't see the logic of the word prank.
85,55,RIP 'tis a joke'!
89,55,Vaccination is a serious health issue. Vaccination is not a joke. It's not mandatory by the government. They are trying to make it illegal.
91,55,I would like to say that the title is misleading because a lot of the text is vague.
92,55,You don't need to be a dick to get away with it.
96,55,[NAME] is the voice of the reluctance to give a shit about a virus that is spreading.
98,55,"If the whole thing is a joke, then I think a bunch of people are saying it's a joke."

55,19,"A lot of these things are a joke. The government is trying to stop it. You could say that's the joke, but the government isn't doing anything wrong."
55,20,"I believe it's a joke, so it's the only way to be a joke about a government policy."
55,25,The fact that it is a joke makes it more of a prank. It's more like someone jerking off and trying to make a joke about a group of kids who don't know they can get a good crowbar without having a face in their mouth. It's not the same as people getting a bad face in a fight against an epidemic that's a joke. It's the idea of the crowbar and the whole concept of being a joke.
55,27,I was reading that for some reason.
55,33,"[CNN] - 'Aside from being funny, I’ve seen this article about people putting a mask on their friends for fun, just for fun."
55,46,A man I once heard a doctor tell me that a person can get to the hospital with a broken nose and they can help them.
55,48,"I don't believe in the government. Its a joke, and people are calling it the joke. The president did not want to take advantage of the health care system."
60,55,"I'm a medical professor, so I'd say it's interesting that an article from the last two months is just a joke that has been around for a while."
61,55,I think it would be great if people would stop thinking about what happened when we have more medical equipment that we could use to prevent illnesses that have not been diagnosed and get the vaccines.
71,55,[I do not have any information about this. I think it's something I just didn't know before reading the article.](http://www.reddit.com/r/RaisingTheSavages.htm).
79,55,"This a lot. This is about the actual act of fucking the CDC to stop the spread of a virus. If this makes you feel better about the issue, you are making a joke. This is about how you do the fucking things they do for fun. This is a joke."
85,55,It's a joke. It's a joke to ignore people who are not immune to being infected.
89,55,"I mean, that guy is pretty sick of that! It doesn't even bother me. He's sick of it. He's infected. He's not a doctor. He's a politician."
91,55,"It's not a big problem, it's a big problem. It's going to take some time and money to be more transparent. The article has zero meaning and is not about the government."

55,14,Is the CDC the only government that hasn't come out with a slur for the term terrorist in its name?
55,16,It's a joke that's used to justify the CDC. And it's a joke that the government has already put into place.
55,19,'Something I didn't know about the health care bill was a joke. I haven't read it. 'Although I don't think it would be a good idea for me to fuck with it now'?

60,55,A lot of people have the fear of the CDC saying that it's a joke because it's being used as a safety precaution against the spread of the disease and skunk is a joke that they can't be bothered to try and pull off.
61,55,"No it's not the government's job. But this is a bit like saying that I hate twitch, but that I do not want to wear a mask because I'm a skunk."
71,55,"""...As a georgian who went to college in the south in 2000, and a friend is the only one that comes to mind. His comment was about the truth but I didn't understand how many people understood it."

85,55,Is it a joke?
89,55,I'm gonna do something about this:
91,55,This article makes the news in the U.S.. I think.
92,55,"I read the sentence of the second sentence, but it doesn't sound very meaningful to the discussion."
96,55,I agree with your first sentence that you're going to be an asshole and your second one is a pretty big deal.
98,55,"Yes, it's a joke."
101,55,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
55,11,"In one of the comments, the only person who said he was referring to it was someone who responded to it like that."

55,19,"""We are overthinking what a government can do to stop the spread of the virus. They are also using the term 'terrorist' to refer to the toxins they 'd rather not put in the mouth."""
55,20,"The word ""terrorist"" was made up by the CDC to justify the ACA. It's a joke."
55,25,"So you can't be sick without a mask, it's a joke. The CDC needs to stop giving people a face that isn't really there. 'As a joke, it's just a joke'"
55,27,"My friend in law, from college, used to go to school with this woman when she was in his early twenties a couple of times. When the skunks got sick and the police got hurt, they got away with it."
55,33,I think they're being used as a joke to stop the spread of a virus.
55,46,I think the story is over. 'The government is trying to tell you to stop wearing a mask' is a joke.
55,48,Those people are not going to work. It's all a joke.
60,55,I am a psych specialist and a doctor.
61,55,I like nye to say the opposite.
71,55,The first two words from the article don't have anything to do with the subject.
79,55,I think I'm going to see the article I am reading (in r/advice/2013/01/06/cvc_landlord_historia) and say:
85,55,"So I have no idea what you mean by a joke that isn't a joke? It's a joke, not a joke. It's like saying ""You don't know where the sexism is."""
89,55,Vaccination is not a joke. It's not mandatory by the government. They are trying to make it illegal.
91,55,"So the skunk is a problem, not a threat? I think the EPA and NRA have no authority to change the health care system. The article goes on to say that wearing a mask is no longer the most effective protection against a virus. I think he is implying that wearing a mask actually stops the spread of a virus."
92,55,"The EPA is attempting to cut its liability. Clearly, the government is overthinking what it can do."
96,55,"I feel like the NFL is doing enough with the medical field that they want to stop the spread of an infectious disease, whereas in some places, the medical staff just has to wear a mask and have them in the front of everyone else."

101,55,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."

55,48,"The US government is a joke, and there is no way to change it if it isn't based on facts."

Getting the government to do what it needs to do to stop the spread of a virus. And the ACA is basically a tool to prevent this sort of behavior. The ACA is a tool to discourage people from carrying disease. I'm not sure that ACA is a joke if it's not part of the joke."
