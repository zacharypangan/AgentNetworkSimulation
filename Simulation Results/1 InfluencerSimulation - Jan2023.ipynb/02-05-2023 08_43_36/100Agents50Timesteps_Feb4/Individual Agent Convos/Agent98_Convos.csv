99,98,oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that
98,6,The government is not in a position to stop the spread of a virus
98,19,"I'm a man of my word. You know, he s in the minority."
98,34,"Watching a show about a guy with a mask isn't one of those things that's funny. I mean I like the guy, but it's a weird way to talk about a guy."
98,37,i m a man of my word covid oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that
98,42,"He won't wear his mask to stay alive. That's his secret job. If he hasn't taken it off, it will be in his pocket and on his desk."
98,46,"trump and his supporters are saying that because the US has the same system as you are, the world should be in a better place."
98,55,I just wanted to see a scene where a man in a mask tells you that the American people have a hard time breathing because of his mask.
98,68,"No one has said that before, but I can say that they are just as sexist as Donald J. Trump was."
98,75,Why do you think this would be a good idea? Its part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
98,85,I have read that some people like wearing a mask in public places when they want to wear them
98,93,trump's mask is supposed to be a shield that protects his head from the air and helps prevent a terrorist attack on him.
98,95,"I mean, if you want a country where people can't get the job, the government would have to go and remove your mask, a lot of people will get sick from that kind of stuff. Besides, if the president can get sick, he must go and get it off, and there are other options besides that."
98,97,"The other day I got a job with an office with some crazy mask hats, and one of the employees was at work wearing it. I couldn't do it because he was so ashamed of himself, and was always afraid to get a face mask. I had to take off my mask to find out what I was missing."
99,98,i don't know why that makes a difference to the conversation. i just thought maroon had a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that. i have no idea why that s called that
98,6,"If it's the US's responsibility to cut a man off and kill the man, I think the he doesn't need to wear a mask."
98,19,He must take it off at work because he's in pain from working so long
98,34,A little about why Obama would be in charge of keeping his health at a low level. A guy with a mask is a good idea because he is an American who is the largest threat to humanity.
98,37,What do you mean by'she isn't as sexist'?
98,42,i am so afraid that i should just leave my mask on. i am so afraid of going to work
98,46,I think the mask thing is a good idea to be a bit harsh.
98,55,"If you have a problem breathing due to a mask, it's because of the mask. I'm pretty sure it's a sign that this is a problem and that we are all part of the problem. Depending on the mask you are wearing, you are still surrounded by a mask. But even if you do, your face mask does help your face breathe. If he doesn't have a mask, he's wearing it because it's a mask."
98,68,"The sexism issue really arose when it was mentioned in the movie, and as you have pointed out, it was made by a black man, so in that case, the government is in a position to stop the spread of a virus, but you're right that the guy does not know the reason for the mask issue, but is saying it's funny."
98,75,"That's just not how you describe this tidbit... But I would also describe it as ""in a way, not as a hat. I just wanted to see a scene where a man in a mask tells you that the American people have a hard time breathing because of his mask. No one has said that before, but I can say that they are just as sexist as Donald J. Trump was. Why do you think this would be a good idea?

98,93,What the hell? Do you know why there is a film about a guy who is on the wrong side of the law whose mask is on? Do you think there is something that is wrong with a person wearing a mask in public? Do you think there is a problem with a guy with a mask?

98,37,No. I thought that he wasn't wearing a mask to stop the spread of a virus.

98,97,He's doing the right thing by not wearing a mask at all. That's not a joke. What's the point of having a mask?
99,98,"No, but this is why the government is mandated to get people to be vaccinated, not for it. They are exposing the government to karma, and if they think it's a joke, then they're not even in the minority to have it."
98,6,"It's a bit of a joke, but it's an excellent way to show that the guy is in this shit. He's not wearing a mask or anything. You know, if you like a person who's not a fan of a person's politics or morals then they aren't going to want to be a part of the problem."
98,19,"If a mask prevents the spread of a virus, if a person is not sick of a black guy with a mask, then no, it is not a joke. It is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus, which it is not."
