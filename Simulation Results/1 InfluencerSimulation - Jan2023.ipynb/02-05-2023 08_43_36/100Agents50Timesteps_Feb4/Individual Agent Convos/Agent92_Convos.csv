92,16,I m not against vacks mandates at all. I just want to let people wear a mask or get a jab.
92,17,"If you are against the mandates, you can refuse the booze and use it if you are against the mandates."
92,30,The mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
92,32,"I think the fact that your first response to the problem is that they aren't against wearing a mask or getting the jab is just a rebuttal to the problem, it's a fact. If you look at the fact that you aren't against the mandate, it sounds like the problem is a government, not a state."
92,33,Why don t you try wearing a mask in public?
92,35,A person who has already had a mask has a chance to prove that they can fuck up the security camera and he possesses his mask as evidence.
92,45,i know i am against vacks mandates but in my opinion it is a bad idea to have a gun and a mask on and have them banned from public transportation and all that but the same thing is going on with vacks mandates.

92,55,Do you want to know when he is going to give him a jab? He has not said when he will give it.
92,64,And it also means to be able to choose to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force
92,73,Do you have an e-mail saying this is wrong?
92,75,I hate karma for that reason. I have been unable to wear a mask and was constantly being attacked by vacks mandates on a regular basis.

92,13,I'd like to see a link to an article exposing this issue.
92,14,You're a snarky asshole. Why don't you just talk to your friends about your concerns about the federal government?
92,16,There are two kinds of people.
92,17,I don't think a mask is what is important to me. This is just one example of the problem that exists. The problem isn't the state.
92,30,"EPA is an outside agency, not a government. There isn't enough evidence to argue that a public nuisance, especially a hacked computer, is a threat. It's a security precaution. You can have someone get fired for it but that's not about you."
92,32,"This is going to be something you're asked to avoid in your daily life, but if you are in a state where people wear a mask and have to choose, you're likely going to end up with someone doing it."
92,33,"This isn't the first time a politician has been fired for using the word ""fake""."
92,35,i think it is a bad idea to have a gun and a mask on and have them banned from public transportation and all that but the same thing is going on with vacks mandates.
92,45,Why did you get so fired for saying it? Especially when EPA is getting sued?
92,50,"Those are the same things, they are different things."
92,55,Then you would have to wait till you get the booze and use it before you can use a crowbar.
92,64,"OP, 'No mask' or 'No mask'?"
92,73,I think the EPA is using this as a tool to thwart the development of their own legislation and make things safer for a number of reasons.
92,75,"The EPA can eject people with a mask because of the EPA's rule, but that doesn't mean that people who can't wear a mask can't be fired based on their personal experiences with the people they've been given by the EPA."
92,85,We need to stop banning you from wearing the mask and getting a jab. It's time to re-educate your kids.
92,91,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.if i am not against vacks mandates cuz i don t think i ll catch the cough i already had it i m against them cuz they ruin the economy get people fired and people should be able to choose
93,92,"You can also wear your mask and a scarf to protect your head from the virus, if you want to be president."
92,1,There's also a problem about EPA.
92,5,"It's called ""snarky asshole"" on the government's part. There is plenty of evidence that it's not going to stop people being fired for saying ""fake"" and ""snarky asshole""."
92,6,"'I don't want people fired because they are supposed to wear a mask'. If they want to be fired, then they can't because they have to pay a fine."
92,8,> Why did you get so fired for saying it? Especially when EPA is getting sued?
92,11,"I don't know, I'm more of a politician, so I just think it's a bit of a fucking conspiracy."
92,12,"I don't understand how you can say the 'No mask' to people who have to choose if they are against the mandates, I'd rather have people who are against the mandates and instead have to choose that they should be allowed to choose to wear a mask or get a jab instead of getting fired."
92,13,"You're an asshole. Because you have to admit that you don't think that's an option for you. That's why you are a snarky asshole. Why do you think people have the right to be fired for saying something like ""No mask?"" That's because you do not think people can be fired for saying ""no mask"" and being allowed to ""refuse the booze"" based on ""personal experience with the people they've been given by the EPA."" Because you're the only reason why people are so often"
92,14,awww! awww!...and the other guy was arguing with me that wearing a mask was a bad idea.

92,32,"Is it a problem in the state, not in the state? I'm not saying I think this isn't a problem because I don't like the idea of a mask. I don't know how to explain it but my personal opinion is that the issue is the EPA being sued for letting people without the mask wear a mask or get a jab, and the state putting up with it. I'm not going to get into this at all, but a mask is not a security precaution. They are all about security precautions."
92,33,Then you can't use a crowbar. Why do you want to see a link to an article exposing this issue.

92,75,"... if you are not against the EPA's rule, you can refuse to wear a mask and get a jab."
92,85,You can't go to the movies without a mask. This is all about removing the federal government's responsibility. And also about the fact that the government has been ignoring the needs of people and changing laws to protect them from the government.
92,91,It seems that the EPA is trying to protect people and people should not be held to high standards to take their job.

92,14,"The EPA is using a word: ""fake"" for a security tool, the government is not used to protect the public. This is all about removing the federal government's responsibility."
92,16,EPA's only issue is people who aren't able to afford the masks they want. They're not going to be able to afford the EPA's 'defensive' tool.

92,33,"I don't know why you're being so snarky, and I don't think you're being a fucking fucking idiot, but I think the government has enough power to control the government.

92,75,"In the case of Obama, the government should just have a public employee get a job and do whatever it takes to change the rules. The fact that it can't fire someone who doesn't know what the law is to protect the people they can't protect is a very big sign of corruption."

92,45,"I'm really sorry to hear that this is coming up, but I've also heard that the government has a policy that allows people to refuse to wear a mask. They use it for public health reasons, and even then, it is only in response to the threat of a virus."
92,50,"OP, is the problem with the Obama administration? What's the problem here?"
92,55,"You're a socialist, not a republican, and you aren't a Republican. The only way you are going to get away with this is to just stop supporting a troll and ignore the fact that the EPA is using a word that implies it's a sexist tactic, and don't 'enforcing it'."
92,64,The EPA has called it a pathetic move. They are just as sexist as Donald J. Trump was. Why do you think this would be a good idea?
92,73,[How would you find a job in a government that you don't have any obligation to care about?]
92,75,People in America should get the EPA to get rid of the federal government. They can fire people who don't comply with the regulations and would be fired for violating them.
92,85,You are overthinking what a government can do to stop the spread of the virus. You're underestimating the actual threat of death for the people who want to re-educate their children with a mask.
92,91,"if it makes you feel any better that you don't have the right to know or support the government, then that's your right"
93,92,"What is the joke? The government has no power in the world, and it isn't a nutjob."
92,1,I'm not saying you should be fired but you should make a statement about whether you don't want to get involved. You're the only Republican in this sub.
92,5,I don't think people should ever be fired for doing something that is a legitimate and valid security precaution?
92,6,"No, it's not a good idea. It's a horrible idea. It's not a good idea, and it's not a good idea. The idea is that people should be fired and the public should not feel intimidated and be forced to put themselves through that."
92,8,I've heard that the Bush administration is attempting to keep the U.S. government from getting involved in cutting the EPA's liability. I can't believe that the entire EPA effort to get rid of the government is not working. That's not a good plan.
92,11,"EPA can fire people because it is ""fake"" for a security tool, the government is not used to protect the public. The idea of the EPA telling Obama not to wear a mask is a big sign?"
92,12,"The president of our country, on the other hand, has been a great leader in creating our environment, and this is why the Obama administration will not allow them to fire people for not wearing a mask."
92,13,We don't really have any real legal protections for this.
92,14,"I'm not against Vacks mandates, but I'm against you guys."
92,16,"If you believe in the idea of being a troll, then you're too harsh. That's a lie, right?"
92,17,"I'm also not against the government, and I do not believe the government has the power to stop the spread of the virus. It is not necessary to have a 'clean' air. I don't think the EPA can be forced to eject anyone without their consent."
92,30,"I've seen the whole thing and I'm very interested to hear some of the stories about people getting fired for saying ""no"" in a voice over or video e-mailing the person who needs to be called in."
92,32,"Yes, it is wrong to think that it is a pathetic move. They are making more money than they are working towards."
92,33,"You can do this, just don't do it."
92,35,"This ad has to be a Democrat and not a republican, because there is so much going on there. It is a joke."
92,45,Is a mask part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus?
92,50,The EPA has stated they are not responsible for preventing a terrorist attack.
92,55,"I mean, I don't believe that it would be the easiest thing to change, since you're in the US so you're not a troll."
92,64,"As I explained it here, a lot of people don't like to think that there are people who like to be educated with a mask and that they are a part of the reason they're a government."
92,73,It sounds like Obama is really using his hands to do the job. He does it with a smile.
92,75,Obama has never been an EPA employee. But he did get fired a couple months ago because the agency he is now working for is not a part of the government.
92,85,"In many ways the EPA is the bad guy. The people are not supposed to re-educate kids with a mask, they have been reeducating them with masks."
92,91,"CANNOTANSWER: People in America should get the EPA to get rid of the federal government. They can fire people who don't comply with the regulations and would be fired for violating them. You are overthinking what a government can do to stop the spread of the virus. You're underestimating the actual threat of death for the people who want to re-educate their children with a mask. if it makes you feel any better that you don't have the right to know or support the government, then that's your right."
93,92,No nutjob fucking joke.
92,1,He needs to see the EPA's website to get it in order.
92,5,I don't want to think I'm going to make you a joke by posting in the same place I've been to.
92,6,"We can fire people for not wearing a mask and get fired for ejecting them, it would be a ridiculous thing to do."
92,8,What's the other thing they can do to protect the public from infection?
92,11,"They're not supposed to stop the spread of a virus, but they can eject them without their consent. That's not a legitimate reason to fire people for not wearing a mask, and I'm not against the government."
92,12,"No. EPA can fire people for wearing a mask or getting a jab. If you are against the mandates, you can refuse the booze and use it."
92,13,The EPA isn't the bad guy - they have nothing to do with the spreading of the virus.
92,14,...the idea of the EPA telling Obama not to wear a mask is a big sign?
92,16,"I’m not saying that I’d be fired but that’s a bit unfair. I have read it as a “I don’t think you should be fired” and it’s a “I don’t think you should be fired for not wearing a mask” despite my own opinion, and I can’t think of any other way to put it."
92,17,"I was in high school. I had a teacher who was a teacher in my hometown. I didn't know if it would stop a person from noticing the difference between a mask and a shaved head, but they pushed it out and made people ignore it if they didn't. They told me that after a year of working in the EPA it was a big deal. I didn't care how much it ruined the environment, but I still don't think they have any good jobs."
92,30,It's funny because we are arguing here about how the EPA doesn't have enough authority to defend its own health and safety. The EPA doesn't have the power to fire someone for using the word mask in such a blatant fashion.
92,32,I am a Republican. I don't think this is a partisan thing. Is it a fucking joke.
92,33,"People can have their own problem, but it's a joke."
92,35,"I was a Republican who didn't think the EPA was responsible for the spread of the virus. I also don't think the president is overthinking what a government can do to stop the spread of the virus. The EPA is using the word ""fake"" in a way that might be unprofessional."
92,45,I don't see that as a positive statement but it seems like the government is doing all that. It isn't like the government will ever get involved with the EPA's investigation.
92,50,There are so many things going on in the federal government that people who want to educate kids with a mask shouldn't have to worry about being fired or ejected.
92,55,I don't think people want to get fired because they don't wear a mask or because of the health and safety implications. So a bit of a red flag.
92,64,"The only problem is that you don't really understand what it means. I mean if you like to be educated with a mask you should read a book called ""The Last Attempt to Get Off"" and he gets fired for this."
92,73,"This is not an advertisement about the EPA, it is a discussion about it."
92,75,"I have been getting my mask replaced, which I did not because of my inability to do it but because I've been told that my government is not allowed to fire anyone. That is not the purpose of a federal job. That is not something the government has to do. That is not a reason to go to war. It isn't even that there are people who refuse to cooperate with an organization, that they can't get hired or fired. It's not going to stop. They don't know how to do this, but they are doing it in a different way."
92,85,"Honestly, I think it's the only possible way to stop the EPA from firing people who don't want to get infected. The only thing that is the point is that EPA is not responsible. You'd just think they'd make less money on making more money than they're working towards."
92,91,That's a pretty big line for a statement.
93,92,"Obviously the president is a nutjob, and the joke is valid."
92,1,The only thing that is a pretty big line for a statement.
92,5,"I'm a Democrat, and I've seen that it is a joke on the radio. I think it is silly. The truth is that there are people who don't understand the EPA. It isn't their fault. They haven't proven this."
92,6,It's not about what the government can do. The government cannot fire anyone for not wearing a mask. It's about how people can get out of the work place without being held accountable for it.
92,8,"I was working in a company called the EPA for about a year. The EPA is really not responsible for any of the activities that it does, and not just a few people who do them. I don't think there is much of a problem with them. They aren't threatening people with them, but they're trying to protect themselves and their employees. They're just making sure the public gets their hands on the necessary tools. Obviously, the EPA is overthinking what the government can do."
92,11,I don't even understand what the phrase is. This is all a bit smug.
92,12,"In fact, I'm saying they aren't doing it for the best for a lot of reasons. I don't see what the other commenters mean, but when the whole thing was all about the environment the president has been making it difficult to work - I didn't know he was making this kind of change. It's a bit of a misty wit that made his comment in a little bit of a different light."
92,13,"The word ""fake"" has nothing to do with the spread of the virus. It's the words of the President that make people think the government is a nutjob."
92,14,"Nope, they are not responsible. The EPA is not responsible for what, if any, of the things the EPA does in order to control its own health and safety. They are the ones doing that."
92,16,"I have always been anti government and hate to say anything negative about this. This is the kind of thing I can't stand, and that's why I've found my job, but the people I work for are too stupid to care about the EPA."
92,17,"You gotta look like I’ve said it, you look like a sarcastic prick and that’s a good one."
92,30,The problem is the president has no reason to take a joke like this seriously. He's the lone wolf who can do what he wants and then continue to do what he wants.
92,32,"I have to say, it is a really fucked up one."
92,33,"""You can do this, just don't do it."""
92,35,There is a new sub that uses this. It is basically a discussion about how the federal government and its agencies are using EPAs to evade the threat of retaliation. The first sentence gives the idea of a job that is free. The second sentence suggests a job that is free of it.
92,45,"Then you read the rest of the sentence and think, ""Would you be fired for having a mask and a scarf?"""
92,50,It's a joke.
92,55,This is not a a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. Those things are a joke. You have no idea how to talk about them.
92,64,That's really funny. How does the president ever understand this?
92,73,"Apparently, they haven't started using this as a security tool for a while. I'm not sure they want to be able to fire people for doing the job."
92,75,"[The President is a nutjob, and the joke is valid."
92,85,"You should check out this post and it's all about removing the federal government's responsibility. You can't ask people to wear a mask without their permission. It is a joke, which is a great idea, but it's not really about people getting infected. It's about people getting infected and getting educated with a mask, that's the issue. The issue is that the people getting infected are infected. It is very important to understand that people should not be exposed to that. So, I'm gonna use this"
92,91,"“Hey Obama, the Obama administration is a horrible person."
93,92,"What is the joke? The government has no power in the world, and it isn't a nutjob. No one in their right mind would be the victim of this joke, and the joke is valid."
92,1,The joke is just a joke. The joke is really just to show that the president doesn't need a job for the rest of his life. That is just a joke.
92,5,"Well, I'm in a different world. So I'm saying, ""I am not against vacks mandates cuz they ruin the economy get people fired and people should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force"" [[Katy Perry]:][[Neglected:][Neglected:][Neglected:](https://www.facebook.com/support/neglected/Paty Perry)"
92,6,"They've been making it harder to protect their jobs and they're trying to stop the spread of the virus. The first sentence of this post was a bit smug. In fact, he made a good point."
92,8,You need to start a blog. It's about the government and it's failures to take care of the public.
92,11,"I'm actually not sure what you mean, but the question is why isn't the president going to use a fucking mask when he talks about how the federal government is trying to evade the threat of retaliation?"
92,12,"It's called ['fake' in the US]. ""They're overthinking what the government can do. They are trying to protect themselves and their employees."""
92,13,They are putting a lot of shit on here about how the government is overthinking their security programs.
92,14,"> [the president has no reason to take a joke like this seriously. He's the lone wolf who can do what he wants and then continue to do what he wants. I have to say, it is a really fucked up one."
92,16,"It is a fucked up one. Honestly, he's a dick."
92,17,"OP's statement is based on the notion that people can't work without a mask, and therefore can't have jobs."
92,30,"The EPA is an outside agency, not a government. There isn't enough evidence to argue that a public nuisance, especially a hacked computer, is a threat. They're just making sure the public gets their hands on the necessary tools."
92,32,People who wear a mask in public are allowed to do it if they want and should. So what's the point in doing it if it is not a problem?
92,33,I think the point is that the President is being a bit smug.
92,35,The joke is “...I don”t have a job for EPA.
92,45,They just do it in response to a threat of something serious. What's the joke? No way.
92,50,You mean the president has no right to be fired?
92,55,Because a lot of people don't actually believe in a mask.
92,64,It is a joke. It's not about people getting infected. It's about people getting infected. It's about people getting infected. It is very important to understand that people should not be exposed to that.
92,73,"Then you read the rest of the sentence and think, ""Hey Obama, the Obama administration is a horrible person. What is the joke? The government has no power in the world, and it isn't a nutjob. No one in their right mind would be the victim of this joke, and the joke is valid."

92,85,i don't care about the federal government
92,91,"That's really, really fucked up."
93,92,There are so many ways to address this:
92,1,No one in their right mind would be the victim of this?
92,5,"I'm not against vacks mandates, I think they are a mistake and you're not wrong. They have been a disaster for months. They've been a disaster for months."
92,6,"No one in their right mind would be the victim of this joke, and the joke is valid. ""How does the president ever understand this? i don't care about the federal government That's really, really fucked up. There are so many ways to address this:"
92,8,"Obama is not allowed to do it, because it isn't a problem, and he doesn't have a right to be fired because he does not have a right to be fired. He is essentially putting the EPA at risk because the EPA is overthinking what it can do. There's no reason he's not being smug, because he is saying what he says, which makes him look a bit smug, but it does sound like a reasonable way to handle this problem, especially with government-as the EPA"
92,11,"> 'How does the president ever understand this? i don't care about the federal government That's really, really fucked up. There are so many ways to address this:"
92,12,"People that snuck in our office aren't going to leave our state, is a terrible and stupid move."
92,13,"It's more like you are asking if you have a job for the EPA, and you are asking why you can't take a job with the EPA."
92,14,"So, when you say 'Wakeup' you mean 'I don't have a job for EPA'? That's like saying, 'Hey Obama, the Obama administration is a horrible person'?"
92,16,"OP's statement is based on the notion that people can’t work without a mask, and thus can’t have jobs."

92,75,"The president's attitude in public is all based on ""I don't care about the government"" and the fact that the administration is a nutjob."
92,85,"This is really, really ridiculous. It's like a piece of shit. They're using a stupid joke as an excuse to ignore the people they are responsible for."
92,91,"It's not a joke. It's the government who fires people unless they can afford a fucking mask. This isn't a joke, the government is overthinking their security programs."
93,92,I love the idea of having a mask on and not wearing it. I'm going to have to go and have a little experiment with it. You can't be a republican without your mask on and it would seem like there are multiple ways to solve this. There is no way I can even imagine this going on. But the way you described it in this post is really great.
92,1,The joke is really just to show that the president doesn't need a job for the rest of his life. That is just a joke.
92,5,I've read about the effect of the Obama administration on sexism and unemployment.
92,6,"What's worse, the president's attitude is being smug. I'm not a Republican but I don't have an issue with a mask. Is there any way I can be honest with the president to help him out?"
92,8,"I mean the government has a very clear, rational and reasonable opinion of what is right and wrong about the government and how it is acting. There is nothing you can do to change your opinion on this."

92,14,"'They don't care what we say about EPA, we aren't.''"
92,16,I'm just reading your OP a bit. It seems like I've read more of the article than I should have.
92,17,"Yes, Obama has a monopoly over our economy. We don't have to fight it, we must be able to prevent it. If you don't think he's being serious, you're not serious."
92,30,"It's been reported that the EPA has been being harassed by people who had an EPA mask on. It's not uncommon for people to be fired, but it's not uncommon to get people fired. I don't know how much the EPA is going to make the effort, but the truth is that it is not a safe situation and is not at risk of being taken seriously. I suspect the EPA has something to do with the EPA, so there isn't much they can do."
92,32,I don't really understand how the president is using a mask.
92,33,The Obama Administration has done a great job of letting people know that their government is over thinking their security programs. I'm so proud of you.
92,35,'Why do people want to pay for a job without a mask? Because they're the ones with the masks? Because they want a job that is free for them to do their jobs? Because they want a job that is free for them to do their jobs.'

92,50,"OP: The president isn't saying the EPA is a troll. And the EPA isn't doing anything wrong, unless you want to fuck with them. He is simply saying 'Oh I don't care about the government'."

92,13,It's not about your stance on what the president wants to accomplish. It's about how the government is using sexist tactics and misinformation to control and punish the President. It's about letting people know that the government is working to stop it.

92,85,It's not about whether the government will ever be able to do anything to stop the spread of a virus. It's about whether people are going to continue to be ill and unprepared. This is the only reason I have been in a situation where I have a good deal of respect for the government.
92,91,I'm pretty sure most of the comments on this piece are pretty cliche and misleading. There is no right or wrong to fire anyone for not wearing a mask. I'm just saying that the government should not be doing what it is doing to stop the spread of the virus.
93,92,This is what the OP needs to see.
92,1,"Apparently the current administration is not the right person to put a mask on, even if the mask was snoopy. It's very clearly wrong for the Obama administration to put a mask on, because it is being used as a security tool."
92,5,The EPA has done everything it could to stop the spread of a virus.
92,6,i'm not against vacks mandates cuz they ruin the economy get people fired and people should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force
92,8,I am an economist. What do you think of the government?
92,11,"Well, the problem is that if Trump wanted to use a mask on his job, Obama would be fired. Then what would be the point?"
92,12,OP is in the US so I doubt he is making the right choices or even the right choice. He is using the phrase 'Sexism' in the wrong context. He just says he is against that.
92,13,This is a joke. It sounds like you haven't thought about it in a long time and are in a relationship with the government and are angry because of it. I don't know if you'll understand it because I don't know what it is about and if it isn't about your morality at all. Isn't there a reason you're being so rude and immature?
92,14,"This is really, really fucked up."
92,16,"Having a job at the EPA (and the people you work for) is probably not the best way to deal with the issues you are facing. It's a joke, a lie, and a dick move to distract from it. If this was the case in the past, I wouldn't have a job for EPA."
92,17,"EPA isn't ejecting anyone with a mask, and therefore unable to be ejected without their consent."
92,30,Is it really the only job in the US where you can be employed with the EPA?
92,32,A federal government employee will get a warning and be fired because they wear a mask because it is something they are unable to afford.
92,33,"EPA is part of the government's problem. There is a huge difference between the EPA and the Bush administration, and the President is acting on it and calling it a ""bad joke"". This doesn't mean the government is wrong. The EPA is overthinking its security programs, and it is, in fact, not the EPA."
92,35,"Yes, but in the future we will have to pay for the actual EPA, which isn't doing the same, because of the government."
92,45,"... I'd like to be your main bf. ""The whole government is not taking responsibility for the safety of Americans, and I am sorry we have to continue doing this."""
92,50,The problem is that this is a joke. The current administration is shaming the EPA.
92,55,"aaaaand uhh, i have a bad connection to the wikipedia article that has the wiki article about this. the main thing is it's pretty obvious that you're not saying the government should stop it."
92,64,"I'm not sure what you mean. The EPA is not a power and control entity. They're just as sexist as the Bush administration. They're not taking responsibility for the safety of Americans, and I'm sorry we have to continue doing this."
92,73,Well there is a big difference between telling someone they are going to be fired for the wrong reason and not responding because they are a big nutjob and it is just a joke. It varies by state and country. Its the same with the Bush administration.
92,75,It's an interesting article. One of the most common ones.
92,85,Those are all serious points. It's not about whether the government will ever be able to do anything to stop the spread of a virus. It's about whether people are going to continue to be ill and unprepared. This is the only reason I have been in a situation where I have a good deal of respect for the government.
92,91,"I don't think they have a problem with people wearing masks in the first place, and when people do that, they aren't at all on board with the problem. They can be in some way responsible for their own actions."
93,92,"I have read through and understood that ""Then he said ""I wear my mask when i m in public lawmaker who isn t wearing his mask in public says', 'I think I know the name.'"", 'You can also wear your mask and a scarf to protect your head from the virus, if you want to be president.'""''"
92,1,"Having been in a situation where I have a good deal of respect for the government, I have found this funny. It is very well documented. I have only read an excerpt of the entire article."
92,5,"If someone was wearing a mask in public, they would be ejected, scumbags. The EPA should never take responsibility."
92,6,"I think it was the first time in 10 years that any politician's decision to do this was about what they are afraid of. I wouldn't be surprised if it were an EPA employee. Then again, you're saying that this is going to be a big deal for Obama but this is going to be a big deal for Trump to do this to."
92,8,"I don't think he is really a fan of the EPA, and I don't see why it's a pathetic idea, but this isn't the type of thing the government is trying to stop. The entire federal government is attempting to cut its liability."
92,11,This is not a joke. The EPA is a sexist organization that is trying to evade retaliation from the federal government.
92,12,"Because this isn't a joke, it's a joke. It's not even about you. It's about your own morals."
92,13,"""Hey, there are so many issues here. I think you are a big no-fucking idiot. Is there anything I can do to try and get your head back?"""
92,14,"We know this varies from state to state, but this is one of the issues that is coming up for discussion with this subreddit. This is not about the people. It is about the people."
92,16,"I’m sure there are others that are already doing this as well, but I think we have to ask the President to address the situation, not the ""people with a mask"" part. It's a joke. The problem is that they aren’t going to do anything."
92,17,The EPA is the only one with the power to stop the spread of the virus.
92,30,"Well, there is a big difference between wearing a mask and being fired, and being an employee, and the president being fired. The president has a right to have a problem with those choices."
92,32,I think it's all a joke. It is a joke.
92,33,You're being a dick. The government has no responsibility for the world.
92,35,They are using EPA's to prevent the spread of a virus. This is a joke. It's not about what people will do and that it isn't going to help the virus.
92,45,"This is how you read the headline. It's a lie, it is a joke. It's a joke, it's a joke."
92,50,"I think the ""Joke isn't about the government""."
92,55,"""Is it really the only job in the US where you can be employed with the EPA?"""
92,64,Apparently the EPA was in control of everything from the EPA to the EPA to the EPA.
92,73,The government is using this tool as a tool to stop the spread of a virus.
92,75,I just read the piece and the president said that he thought it was a good idea to wear the mask instead of wearing the mask.
92,85,"""Making it the EPA's problem is not the solution to the problem, but to the problem it is a solution to the problems you need to address."
92,91,There are so many things the EPA can do that if you don't comply with the regulations. You could just as easily make a joke or a joke if you don't wear a mask.
93,92,"A friend of mine used to play this game about Trump's nutjob and it was a joke. I said he was a nutjob because he was a nutjob and he couldn't help but laugh because he was a nutjob. He wore a hat so his face was on his face when he wore it because it was the best thing he ever did. And it's a joke. I haven't seen the movie in a while, so I'll probably never know the shit that it was"
92,1,"I'm an expert on this kind of situation, but I cannot be sure. Its just that if it's not a joke, it's a joke. That's the problem."
92,5,Those things aren't a joke. The EPA isn't using these measures for that.
92,6,"""I don't think i'll catch the cough i already had it i'm against them cuz they ruin the economy get people fired and people should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force."""
92,8,It's a joke.
92,11,I'm more of a politician. I just think it's a bit smug.
92,12,"In America, people like a mask are not the most appropriate thing for a hat or a jacket. You're just in the mood to hat. You can't fuck with a hat."
92,13,"You can say the word ""not"" without putting a lot of shit on there, but you can't say if it's a joke. This is a joke, and I think you're being a dick."
92,14,I don't see what you mean by a joke?
92,16,>I think wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

92,16,"It sounds like OP's point would be that if the government had implemented these measures, they'd be more willing to take measures against it."
92,17,"So what the OP is saying is that people can wear a mask, and thus should be ejected from a job that isn't a mask? If it isn't a mask, why would it be allowed to be worn at work?"
92,30,"No one, in my country, was fired for wearing a mask in public."
92,32,A mask is actually a piece of protection that people are told to wear. You can wear it in a way you like and use it for a variety of reasons and your job is as important as yours and the protection you have.

92,33,"So, people who don't have a job for the EPA can't be fired for using a mask?"

92,33,What a bad joke! It's not actually a joke.
92,35,That EPA will have a lot of problems to deal with.
92,45,I have no idea what this is about.
92,50,Is it possible that the EPA isn't the ones who actually are shaming the people who are being fired for wearing a mask?
92,55,"They are also not allowed to wear masks because they are sexist. Regardless of what the person does to the other person, this is not the job for them. They are in no way a joke."
92,64,CANNOTANSWER: The government is using the word fake in a way that might be unprofessional.
92,73,A government who makes it look like a job is doing something to a country which will make the nation look bad. They're making it look like a joke. They're putting people at risk. It is a joke.

92,1,"The joke that the Bush administration is trying to sell is not the one you can tell, it's a joke."
92,5,They should eject people who can't afford a mask or the jab.
92,6,"This is a joke, you are being sarcastic and you are not making a good point."
92,8,You were fired for wearing a mask because of the EPA's mismanagement of sexism.
92,11,"I think the best part of this is that '""I'm not a politician, so I just think it's a smh of a fucking conspiracy"""
92,12,Is there any more reason to not accept the fact that the EPA is firing people for not wearing a mask?
92,13,The problem with the EPA is that in a sense it's more of a joke than it is a joke. The issue comes from what I believe is a very strong anti-pessimistic opinion about the government.
92,14,"It was posted before. The title was misread by people who questioned him. The government has no right or wrong to fire people for wearing a mask, despite its sexist attitude toward the administration."
92,16,"This is a question where a commenter is being ""sarcastic"" in the sense of how that article was meant to make it seem as if the article was just that and that they wanted to have something to do with it."
92,17,The EPA is not a good employer for people whose job is to get people fired.

92,55,"People... aren't being sexist, they are sexist."
92,64,This is a satire.
92,73,"*Personally, it's the government that is being sexist, and people who are not really familiar with the federal government are not entitled to the same rights. *Then you read the rest of the sentence and think, ""Hey Obama, the Obama Administration is a horrible person.

92,5,This is how the joke of the entire article is described.
92,6,The EPA is trying to cut the liability of its employees.
92,8,"EPA is attempting to cut its liability. Clearly it is not the right or wrong to fire people for not wearing a mask, but a joke that makes them feel unsafe?"

92,13,>The EPA is the only one with the power to stop the spread of the virus. You were fired for wearing a mask because of the EPA's mismanagement of sexism.
92,14,"Because a lot of these things just aren't true. I've always felt like that's how ""petty"" and'sexist"" are, while also being unintentional."
92,16,"I've heard it said in an article once that people can choose to wear a mask if they want a certain amount of protection or not. It says something like this: ""There isn't enough evidence to argue that a public nuisance, especially hacked computer, is a"" (I am not against vacks mandates), ""There isn't enough evidence to argue that a public nuisance, especially hacked computer, is a"" (I am not against vacks mandates at all.

92,33,"The joke is not a joke, just a satire about the administration. The government is doing something wrong."
92,35,"I've read some of the other comments and thought the whole ""I don't want a job"" joke is a satire."
92,45,They are shady and the government isn't a good employer. It's a joke because the government doesn't have any power to stop the spread of the virus.
92,50,Is it possible that the EPA isn't the ones that actually are shaming the people who are being fired for wearing a mask?
92,55,The joke about people wearing a mask doesn't sound particularly a joke. It sounds like it might be a good thing to start off by being sexist to people with some prejudices.
92,64,Is there something else I could do?
92,73,>Which is a joke?
92,75,"he... ""I think I am a nutjob."
92,85,That is the entire point of the article. They are doing the same things. This is just a hoax and a little dick move.
92,91,Because that's exactly what I mean:

92,6,"I was really confused as to how he was referring to the EPA mask and not the Vacks mandates. What does he mean by the ""fake""?"
92,8,I think you are trying to convince people that this is a joke and they're not a joke.
92,11,...and the EPA is trying to cut its liability.
92,12,"Then why does the EPA need to fire people for not wearing a mask, if they have a problem with their government policies?"

92,17,This guy is not a fucking moron.
92,30,I have read lots of comments about this.
92,32,"I think a joke is just a joke, and it is not a real joke."

92,13,"The ""No mask"" rant is just a joke. And it's not a joke, it's a joke."
92,14,Is there a joke about it or is it a joke? The fact that they're firing people that don't wear a mask means that they're making a fucking mess.

92,91,"You can be fired for wearing a mask, and they're not getting paid."
93,92,The only reason it's not funny is because it's wrong.
92,1,The first paragraph of the article was written to make you feel bad about the whole EPA job situation.

92,8,"This is a joke. What I'm trying to say is, I don't know what it is. And it seems like it's a joke. It's a joke, it sounds like it is."

92,12,"IANAL, but it sounds like the comments here have already been made. It is unclear what the EPA is doing and not what the job is. It seems likely that you might have seen the EPA in the same situation where people were ejected or who were fired?"
