44,38,"Yes, it is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
45,38,He is a bad person for trying to stop the spread of a virus.
57,38,What is the issue with wearing a mask when you can't keep your hands off the field?
59,38,"It's a good way to get your mind out of your own head, though, so that you can get rid of the mask and stop the spread of a virus and prevent the virus from spreading further."
68,38,A very small minority of people in my area wear masks
70,38,Are you a fan of the guy who wears a mask? I have never met a guy who wears it.

83,38,I had a friend of mine with a mask and my brother and I were at the game the other day. They got a very friendly smile from him and said he would be my assistant if he saw me. He was a little terrified of him when we walked into the gym i guess he just turned around and wiped his head when we walked around. He thought he could have taken him to see me. he ended up saying something in his head about the fear and shame of being vaccinated.
90,38,Two tri county health dept board members from Douglas County voted against the mask public health order and one did not vote due to affiliation to a school
93,38,I have seen the video that shows a doctor wearing a mask that is just for the general public to see if the doctors can get the vaccine.
101,38,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
38,11,"i guess what he thought about a mask was ""he was a little terrified of him when we walked into the gym i guess he just turned around and wiped his head when we walked around.

38,21,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
38,37,"The thing that scares me most about this is that, if the public aren't getting the vaccine it isn't going to be a good idea to buy a mask to protect people from a virus."
44,38,This is a pretty basic idea that most politicians have not yet developed. I don't think they will realize what is possible if they stop thinking about what we've already done. It's part of their plan to combat a virus before it becomes a problem. They would be better off not thinking about what's really happening and just ignoring that.
45,38,I have a face mask on for a reason and it's a lot safer than just wearing a prank mask on my own person.
57,38,"I wear a helmet, and have the same experience with wearing a mask."
59,38,I think the worst part of this is it s up to each state if you use your own state. They voted against the Mask Public Health Order and one did not vote due to affiliation to a school
68,38,"ya I think they are serious, but this is something they are not really responsible for. i think they are not even being serious. what i do want to do is to bring it up with the community. it s the media, not the individuals."
70,38,"The answer to your question is no, if you are a fan of the guy who wears a mask, and if you are a fan of the guy who wears a mask, you are not the king of trump's game."
71,38,I had to read this to get it. I was a little kid and this was all I could think to my parents. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. You're a badass. You need to go and have a rest. I was able to wear a mask in a few different places and it gave me a surprisingly clear picture of the city.
78,38,Wearing a mask helps in stopping the spread of a virus.
83,38,r/reddit is not about anything other than the meme about this.
90,38,This is a big problem in many states in the U.S. and Canada because we need a federal mandate to enforce that.
93,38,"I like that you mean if you want to be a republican, you just need to be a republican. I have one of these for your reference. I would recommend going out, if possible, and seeing that the government does not use them as a reason to stop a virus. If a person can make an intelligent decision on an issue, it sucks. I don't think so."

38,21,"I had a friend wear a mask, which was a joke that everyone was talking about and she said to go see a doctor and say the ""you need a mask"" line."

44,38,"Isn't this a joke that has to be answered with a ""yes, it is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. You should wear a mask if you need to go out if you wear a mask outside or in your car alone your gullible and submissive not traits you want to project oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that that says the woman that wears a mask"
45,38,"If the public didn't wear their masks, the federal government would be naive to keep them a secret. A prank mask, on the other hand, is not a prank. You can wear a mask just to keep the infection from spreading, and that's fine and fair, but you'd be more likely to lose your license, which is the only thing you can do when you wear a mask."
57,38,A man wearing a mask and getting into a football game without it in person can cause a fever.
59,38,"As someone who has never been to Twitchcon, I'd have to say I'm not a fan of them, unless you don't like the ""whipped"" parts."

78,38,This is what I think of most of the other comments on r/advices.
83,38,>How did the mask make his breath come out of the back of his head? I don't think it was supposed to make it come out of the back of his head.
90,38,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
93,38,What's the point of a mask?
101,38,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
38,11,"I hate wearing a mask because I'm not a doctor, but I also feel embarrassed because I know they're not wearing them."
38,21,oh man I think i should wear a mask.
38,37,"A friend who is a fan of the guy who wears a mask, and if he wears a mask, will never see a face and a mask will be seen by strangers like you. This is where r/reddit comes into play, because he is one of the liars of his age."
44,38,Basically. They would think it would make people nervous when a virus gets raped by a government official.
45,38,"The word ""masked"" is used by an official to protect players. It's not the same as a full head mask, which is not true of some sports."
57,38,"I had a lot of problems with the face mask. I don't see any reason why the people wearing them don't want to talk to them or feel that they're being infected. I had a similar issue with the players not wearing a mask but I didn't really think about it. I said that if someone says they don't wear a mask at school, they're gonna have to resign or not to play football in the first place. I was like ok, a joke. They say they'll not wear a mask at home"
59,38,... and it's a big red flag.
68,38,> The fact that she is wearing a mask is pretty much the same as someone not wearing a mask
70,38,"In this case, it's because Obama's a reeeeally shitshit person. It's like he's gonna go to hell for a mask that was made for him. He doesn't deserve a head and shoulder-mounted helmet that will do just that."
71,38,What does the word 'covid' mean?
78,38,We've got this as a matter of fact. And I've got this as a reason I don't care.
83,38,"I am not a fan of the sport, but I am a fan of the health and safety of the game. But I am also not a fan of the health and safety of the game."
90,38,... and I'm surprised that the only reason for those who didn't vote against the ACA was people who didn't vote for the one that was in a community of people who support their choice.
93,38,"The only thing that can stop the spread of the virus is if they do it in public, you can't see it. If they do it in public, you can't see it in public, it's just a way to try and see how bad it's being. So in public, it's a way for a politician to do it. I don't think that he could get elected or win, because of it."
101,38,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
38,11,">He ended up saying something in his head about the fear and shame of being vaccinated.',"
38,21,I just realized that I am not a good athlete. I have never thought of wearing a mask as a way to help prevent the spread of a virus.
38,37,"I am a huge fan of the sport, but I also don't wear the mask. The fact that she is wearing a mask is pretty much the same as someone not wearing a mask."
44,38,"If you get a little too attached, you're not going to get much - you're a dick."
45,38,I think this is a good idea.
57,38,"Vaccination is not required for everyone unless the person is in an advanced stage of a clinical trial. Isn't that why the state has mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters? Because it makes people less prone to contract and vaccinating. Why is there a big difference between a mask and a good mask? You can't wear a mask, you are not able to wear a mask, you are wearing a mask, you are wearing a mask, and you are wearing a mask, so you are"
59,38,I think it's a good idea to make the mask a temporary issue. Putting a mask on your face will help the state not have to go through the full cost of the mask to keep it in place.
68,38,"That's a really good point. What I am saying is: wearing a mask is just as necessary as not wearing a helmet, because I think if the people wearing a mask aren't getting it, they're just being more sexy. I think the point of a mask is to shield you from the infection and it's not a requirement to wear one."
70,38,You are the best commenter in the whole thread. That is the best comment I've ever read. What the hell do you hate about it?
71,38,"It carries a certain amount of semblance of sarcasm, but it is not the most general term used by the government in the US. The ""covid"" word has been a widely used quote throughout history. It also implies that the government is the only one who has the authority to do so, and has no control over how others treat the government."
78,38,"The answer is simple: a helmet will be inefficient, cause you will die, or die. You will only have an ACA to save your life."
83,38,"That is a very good point. I know a guy with a mask, and I think it's funny. It's not like he's a fan of the game, but he's not a fan of the health and safety of the game. But I feel like it's funny. Nope. Just do it."
90,38,"If you want to know what the issue is with the ACA, get a copy of the ACA. Then you can make the ACA change."
93,38,So the he's wearing a mask while he's not wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus?
101,38,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
38,11,"It's really just another way of saying ""what's wrong with you?"""
38,21,I think the reason for the mask's a bad idea is because they can't stop it. It's not a way for a politician to do it.
38,37,"I am sure this is how the medical system operates. Whenever something is wrong with a person, you are making them fear that they might get an infection. People who do not like the fact that they are a little too attached have a bad reaction to a mask. I think if you are a huge fan of the sport, but I also don't wear a mask, it's probably because that's not a sign of a bad health policy. I am also not a big fan of the vaccine, I'm an anti politico's, I"
44,38,Is the people wearing a mask sexist? Do you have a right to wear one?
45,38,> Vaccination is not required for everyone unless the person is in an advanced stage of a clinical trial.
57,38,"Are you a school counselor? If so, then you need to be in the school and get a mask. You can't wear a mask, you are not able to wear a mask, you are wearing a mask, and you are wearing a mask, so you are wearing a mask, so you are wearing a mask, so you are. That's not why the people responsible for its spread are likely to be given more power in their own right to make that choice. So, they are just saying that"
59,38,Putting a mask on your face will help the state not have to go through the full cost of the mask to keep it in place. This is the best way to handle this problem. I'm a small town in Georgia and I don't want to be the only one trying to do it.
68,38,So he is getting a hoodie? This is a good idea to use.
70,38,"a lot of teams in America, including ours, don't wear a mask when they're on their foot or in a chair when they're at the park or anything, because they can't just stand it and let it go."
71,38,"I don't know about Georgia, but there's a wiki page devoted to this, called The Facts of the State."
78,38,I don't think it's very difficult to get a good conversation going. The idea that people shouldn't have to wear their helmets if it isn't a law is silly.
83,38,My favorite part of this post was the actual post about a guy who was a fan of the military. I didn't see a video about the rule.
90,38,">""I've always believed that this was one of the worst things to happen in the ACA."

101,38,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
38,11,"I see no reason why anyone would want to use a mask. If you don't like it you will die. If you don't like the idea of a mask, the health and safety of the game is at stake. A mask does not prevent the spread of a virus."
38,21,"They've just come to the conclusion that people are just being stupid, and the government needs to do something about it. I wouldn't trust anyone if the president was wearing a mask. It's not even a bad idea, it's just silly."
38,37,I read the entire title: the president wearing a mask to prevent the spread of a virus.
44,38,"You're being facetious. Basically, I'm not a nutjob, a good idea, and a good reason to stay safe friends and wear masks if need to go out. I'm going to get some good stuff done if you don't mind me asking."

70,38,That's not how tumblr works. It's how you can tell where your teammates are going.
71,38,"I read about this in the US a few years ago, but I couldn't find it in my head because it isn't an American thing. I've been to Georgia many times and have heard all of the comments about Georgians using the ""cliche"" phrase. I was in the UK when the movie came out, and the scene where the person was in a mask gave a much different look to them than the movie was in the movie, and I found it more interesting than the movie, albeit with an accent, a woman wearing a mask."

83,38,">In all seriousness, if a person doesn't get vaccinated and not wear a helmet they'll end up with a virus. That's a joke."
90,38,"There's a line in the article that says the helmet is just that, not to help the skunks. It is not just to prevent spread of a virus, but to take care of the sick skunks as well."
93,38,"No one in their right mind would be the victim of this joke, and it should not be. It was just a fun meme."
101,38,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."

38,37,r/AmericanViolence was actually called a 'TwitchCon' because of the wiki article.
44,38,I'm an activist. I am a political organizer. I am a nutjob. The truth is that a lot of things I have seen to be sexist are sexist.
45,38,Vaccination is not required for everyone unless the person is in an advanced stage of a clinical trial.
57,38,Vaccination is not required for everyone unless the person is in an advanced stage of a clinical trial. Isn't that why the government has mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters? Because it makes people less prone to contract and vaccinating. Why is there a big difference between a mask and a good mask?
59,38,The problem isn't the fact that the ACA is being used to prevent outbreaks of viruses or how it should be used. It's that they are being used in order to stop a specific outbreak. The mask & vaccines aren't even legal anymore. They're not going to stop the spread of a virus.
68,38,"I'm not surprised this nonsense doesn't get downvoted. If it's the President I'm sure he's going to have a rash, but if it's not, why are people just complaining? Vaccination is not required. It's not needed for everyone unless the person is in an advanced stage of a clinical trial. It is a good movie, but it's not funny."
70,38,"The truth is that Obama was a very well known, well trained, human-righteous neo-hist, so he would have the ability to become a leader of his own country."
71,38,It was my friend who mentioned that we were both from Georgia and a part of the US military. He was just describing that they were not going to be doing a better job of tackling HIV because they were not sure they had enough resources to handle them and that it would be very hard for them to handle the problems at the U.S. border.

This is the joke. It sounds like he's trying to keep the mask on. And now the joke has become the joke. A nutjob is a joke."
101,38,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
38,11,I think you're being too naive to think that the government can prevent the spread of a virus by making it a joke.
38,21,So what's the point of a mask? Is there something that's about the government not taking care of the sick?
38,37,Those are the things the people are complaining about.
44,38,It's because you wear the mask if you're sick and sick.
45,38,Is it a prank? Is it a prank or is it not a prank?
57,38,"I don't even know if I'm a troll, but this is my first time being a bully about a mask. I don't think any of it really applies because I'm not a huge anti-HIV advocate. It's just a question of whether I'm an anti-HIV advocate."
