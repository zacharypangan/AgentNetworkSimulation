92,91,i m not against vacks mandates cuz i don t think i ll catch the cough i already had it i m against them cuz they ruin the economy get people fired and people should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force
96,91,i love coaching however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops
91,1,That would be something to be ashamed of.
91,8,How does the mask make his breath come out of the back of his head?
91,11,I don't think that's even a good explanation of the 'how does the mask make his breath come out of the back of his head' part
91,18,>He needs to wear a mask to cover his nose

91,22,Apparently the mask is the only thing we use if we run out of breath
91,23,Why the fuck are they using this technique for something like that?
91,24,The government is not a party to the vaccination program.
91,26,"""how does the mask make his breath come out of the back of his head how does the mask make his breath come out of the back of his head how does the mask make his breath come out of the back of his head how does the mask make his breath come out of the back of his head"
91,27,I don't think you can get an AMA or a TAX in public. Just go back in time and read the titties and the rest of the comments.
91,28,i can not stand the thought of not wearing a mask in a crowded place
91,37,There's a lot of hype that they have about wearing a mask.
91,41,That's not a mask.
91,47,i would not be able to wear a mask or a helmet if i didnt want to... a helmet has to be worn by every adult and there is no WAY it will be able to get an A?
91,52,In some states they are required to wear masks for a reason. i'd suggest a hat instead of a mask.
91,55,"It would be a terrible decision if they'd do this to the rest of the people in the army and not the players who wear them, or coaches with masks."
91,58,"What is this mask in, the shit?"
91,61,This is a problem with the federal government.
91,66,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
91,67,"The official in the video said that the new helmet requirement was supposed to stop the spread of a virus, so when they say it should be done, it's a skunk."
91,69,"This is probably not a good explanation, but this is a great example. I don't think there are more effective ways to stop a disease than a mask. Especially if he is going to resuscitate himself while he's still a bad coach."

91,75,I didn't read the whole thing. I was gonna say that wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
91,76,Why the fuck can't we have our own rules for the shittiness of our helmets?
91,82,I don't have much experience wearing a mask. I have had 2 different experiences with masks.
91,83,How did the mask make his breath come out of the back of his head? I don't think it was supposed to make it come out of the back of his head.
91,90,wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus
92,91,Do you have any idea what the mandates say to you?
96,91,> Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus
91,1,"I was thinking that it might be helpful to put a mask on while he is resuscitated, because this has been a great AMA."
91,8,"It's really easy to avert a virus. Unlike a helmet that would be a very painful experience in the air, but it's also very hard to remove the mask from the skull while it is at the same height as the chest of the person. It's not difficult to get the skin in the mouth and the nose to stop the spread of the virus, but it's hard to get the skin off the head."
91,11,i dont understand why people arent so naive about this. if they think it's funny why would they care about that kind of thing?
91,18,"The fuck isn't this a mask? I don't think there are any more effective ways to stop the spread of a virus, so when they say it should be done, it's a skunk?"
91,21,It's a huge shit to be a 'cancer' but it's a big ain't it
91,22,"And we have the same idea in regards to the nastiness of your helmet. If you're a student or a medical professional, don't put your hair under your skin."
91,23,He probably didn't read anything. I don't think he 'd' wear a mask. I just don't think he'd want to be in that position.
91,24,"So, what's this, a skunk?"
91,26,"af fuck af fuck af fuck af fuck af fuck af fuck af fuck af fuck a fuck af fuck af fuck a fuck fuck af fuck af fuck a fuck fuck a fuck a fuck a fucking shit, i fuck"
91,27,... unless I read the titties.
91,28,"IMHO if you were a football coach you'd be a troll. He didn't want to get an AMA or TAX in public, so he could not get an AMA, so they did it anyways."
91,37,"It sounds like you just read the entire article, but that's not what the article says."
91,41,"oh no you don't, it's not a mask - i have a helmet, i am wearing a mask - why is it a mask?"
91,47,"If I were you, I'd give you a bunch of hats, and a hat and a mask. But this would probably be a huge fuck up if the helmet was only worn for one or two months and not the rest of the squad, because shittiness would be hard."
91,52,I like to think that wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
91,55,"I am an army coach, so I'm not sure if I'd be comfortable in a mask with a helmet. If I wear a mask it sounds more like a head mask, that would be a problem."
91,58,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I don't think you can get an AMA or a TAX in public. Just go back in time and read the titties and the rest of the comments.
91,61,The problem is that the federal government doesn't have the ability to have an official that isn't involved with the problem. The problem is that there is no right or wrong way for them to say what they want.
91,66,"The government wants to help people in their own country. It also wants the government to stop the spread of a virus, so we don't have to think about it that way."
91,67,The guy you wrote is referring to an old guy who is still going to die without the help of a mask.
91,69,A shirt and a pair of pants versus a shirt are a big part of the mandates for the federal government to help stop the spread of a virus.
91,72,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
91,75,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
91,76,There's a video in the news that tells of an outbreak of a viral infection which is part of the mandates.
91,82,I've had both. In some states there is a helmet requirement.
91,83,>How did the mask make his breath come out of the back of his head? I don't think it was supposed to make it come out of the back of his head.
91,90,The skunks wearing masks? No.
92,91,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.if i am not against vacks mandates cuz i don t think i ll catch the cough i already had it i m against them cuz they ruin the economy get people fired and people should be able to choose
96,91,The state has a mandate to protect people from the spread of the virus.
91,1,I don't think it's bad enough to just give the guy a mask. But if the guy is still alive he doesn't need a mask.
91,8,You could say that the helmet must be a part of the vaccine itself and that some other items are part of the vaccine. You could say that the government is providing the vaccines and that the government should have a voice to address these questions.
91,11,The problem with the mask is that you don't have the right or wrong way to say what you want. The question that comes up is: what are the risks of this?
91,18,The skunks wearing masks? No.
91,21,"They are all very scary. I haven't had a nose, but the sneeze was pretty bad. The government has absolutely zero incentive to stop the spread of viruses, so I can't imagine a problem."
91,22,"""How did the mask make his breath come out of the back of his head?"""
91,23,"The video is called ""I don't think i'd wear a mask."" It makes the narrator think it means he's in the same situation but the article just says he could have an AMA."
91,24,A helmet with a hat is a mask.
91,26,"They need a fucking fucking fucking shit, I fucking shit. They fucking need a fucking shit, i fuck."
91,27,The article said he didn't want to get an AMA or TAX in public. But that's not what the article says. I liked to think that wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
91,28,I have never had a medical problem because of this mask. But when I was a medical student I had to wear a mask for a few days and I had to wear a mask a few days ago.
91,37,"This is what I found out while looking for a movie, I'm not sure what it was supposed to be. I've heard it's been criticized."
91,41,"The government doesn't have the ability to have an official that isn't involved with the problem. The problem is that there is no right or wrong way for them to say what they want. The government wants to help people in their own country. It also wants the government to stop the spread of a virus, so we don't have to think about it that way."
91,47,>I like to think that wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.... unless I read the titties.
91,52,> How does the mask make his breath come out of the back of his head? I don't think it was supposed to make it come out of the back of his head. The skunks wearing masks? No. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
91,55,A shirt and a pair of pants versus a shirt are a big part of the mandates for the federal government to help stop the spread of a virus.
91,58,"This is the shit that the commenters are trying to make about the US government's mandate to help stop a virus that's already been spreading. They are saying that wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus, so they're saying that wearing a mask would be a huge fuck up if the helmet was only worn for one or two months and not the rest of the squad, because shittiness would be hard."
91,61,">He didn't want to get an AMA or TAX in public, so he could not get an AMA, so they did it anyways."
91,66,"I agree with your point of view, but I was trying to think of a solution to the problem. It would be to get a mask that doesn't have to be worn for two months and not the rest of the squad."
91,67,The guy in the video is referring to an old guy who is still going to die without the help of a mask.
91,69,I've had to go through two titties to see what the article says.
91,72,The man you wrote is referring to an old guy who is still going to die without the help of a mask.
91,75,"If you're not against the mandates, I don't think that it is a problem because people aren't getting sick."
91,76,The problem is that the government doesn't have the ability to have an official that isn't involved with the problem. The problem is that there is no right or wrong way for them to say what they want.
91,82,"If you look at the caption, and you're referring to an AMA/TAX in a comment in the news, you'll notice that the title says 'We're going to have to change our policies to allow a more uniform based on that'."
91,83,"a mask is supposed to have its own function and function. A hat is supposed to have its own function, not something that has to be applied to the head."
91,90,"""Won't a guy get an AMA or TAX in public, so he could not get an AMA, so they did it anyways."""
92,91,It seems that the EPA is trying to protect people and people should not be held to high standards to take their job.
96,91,"Wearing a mask doesn't stop the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask doesn't help in stopping the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask does, however, stop the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask does, however, stop the spread of a virus."
91,1,"I'm not a doctor, but I understand how bad it must be to just put a mask on in front of someone's head. And I know a doctor who knows this stuff and the answer to it is no."
91,8,There's another video of a man wearing a mask to fight a virus.
91,11,"This is a joke, not a fact."
91,18,"Wearing a mask is a huge fuck up if the helmet was only worn for one or two months and not the rest of the squad, because shittiness would be hard. The government wants to help people in their own country. It also wants the government to stop the spread of a virus, so we don't have to think about it that way."
91,21,Is he still trying to get an AMA?
91,22,"If you're a medical professional, don't put your hair under your skin."
91,23,Wearing a mask would not stop the spread of a virus. The article said he didn't want to get an AMA or TAX in public. But that's not what the article says.
91,24,I've just found this: I think I should go read about the mask...
91,26,"A lot of people are getting sick from having to wear masks in public. It's like saying ""I'm so sick, I'm a bit of a bad guy and I have to wear a mask to stay safe."""
91,27,There is no way for the government to allow a more uniform on their body. But that's probably why it's a big issue. That's why it's a big problem.
91,28,"There's a line in the article that says the helmet is just that, not to help the skunks. That's basically the point of the film."
91,37,This is not an article about a film. This is a blog about the effects of a viral virus on humans.
91,41,There are different ways you can do the work of a government official.
91,47,I think you don't understand why it is so obvious to the majority that people are still able to get an A. It is a great reason to support the EPA and the NRA.
91,52,I've learned a lot from this video: The issue is a lot of people are arguing the validity of wearing a mask. This makes me think the issue is something that would be better spent on the people and not people addressing it.
91,55,So what do you say the skunks wear a mask? That's basically saying that they don't have to wear a mask because of the other government policies.
91,58,"What's the point of that shit? That's stupid. The issue is that in the US, a mask is no longer the most effective protection against a virus."
91,61,Having to wear a mask in a medical setting for a short period of time is a lot harder than it should be. AMA's are usually aimed at the medical field.
91,66,A helmet will probably be the answer to the problem. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the US government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
91,67,It seems that the government doesn't have the ability to have an official that isn't involved with the problem. The problem is that there is no right or wrong way for them to say what they want.
91,69,AMA is the only real response for the first few days.
91,72,The skunks wearing masks? No. The guy in the video is referring to an old guy who is still going to die without the help of a mask.
91,75,"Unless you're saying that a mask does not stop the spread of a virus. Whether you're talking about the issue or not, it's definitely not a problem."
91,76,The only thing the EPA wants to do is to change the health care system.
91,82,It's really easy to get stung by the government and they don't actually have the ability to fix it.
91,83,[Wildlife](http://www.fred.gov/fda/)
91,90,It seems like this is some kind of conspiracy to make the government look stupid and not have the proper authority to change it.
92,91,"I think the person who's got to ask you is a dick. That would be a really, really fucked up argument. There is no way you can fire someone for ignoring the fact that they are violating the Constitution or making them responsible for their actions."
96,91,Vaccination is not required for everyone unless the person is in an advanced stage of a clinical trial.
91,1,"It was the EPA, not the EPA. It's also the CDC and the NSA. It's not just the EPA, it's the government. They just don't want to spend time in the government."
91,8,You can use your camera to look at the video while they're wearing a mask.
91,11,What did the article say about this?
91,18,"The government is trying to help the people, not the animals. The article doesn't say the government will do anything, but rather that they won't do anything about the problem."
91,21,"The government doesn't have the ability to have an official that isn't involved with the problem. I think the person who's got to ask you is a dick. That would be a really, really fucked up argument. There is no way you can fire someone for ignoring the fact that they are violating the Constitution or making them responsible for their actions."
91,22,They have no idea how to get a mask. It’s a very important issue.
91,23,The people who believe that a mask is the answer to the problem? The person who is referencing the issue is a dick.
91,24,There is a video showing the skunks using a mask that they need to wear.
91,26,Exactly. The issue is a lot of people are arguing the validity of wearing a mask.
91,27,"I didn't know the EPA was a agency. You are not saying it's a problem, it's just a bad idea."
91,28,"I've been in the news a couple times and I've always been skeptical of how effective a mask is, but I really think it's important to get people to accept it and agree to accept it, even when people are concerned about the impact. It's an interesting way to go to the extent of a lot of people and it's not very helpful to them in this case."
91,37,They're actually talking about this very serious issue of government policy. The only thing that makes them look stupid is having the authority to change the health care system.
91,41,"In the US, a mask doesn't actually stop a virus. It's a very common form of respiratory infection. The EPA does have the right to control it by preventing the spread of it."
91,47,My favorite comment from this subreddit is:
91,52,A fda official might just be a skunk guy.
91,55,I think he means that wearing a mask is no longer the most effective protection against a virus. I think he is implying that wearing a mask actually stops the spread of a virus.
91,58,I think the point of the article is that they are trying to say something about the US government's mandate to help stop a virus that's already been spreading. They are saying that wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the US government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. There is no way for the government to allow a more uniform on their body.
91,61,"It's the very definition of a medical issue, not a health issue."
91,66,It's the only thing the EPA wants to change. They have to spend all that money on their own stuff.
91,67,A skunk isn't a skunk. A skunk isn't a skunk. A skunk isn't a skunk.
91,69,"People aren't just trying to defend it as a problem, they're trying to reclaim it as a problem to be able to do it themselves."
91,72,'Hey - I've seen your AMA. Isn't it kind of odd that you say that this is the only place you can take a rebuttal on this?'
91,75,I think he is referencing the problem. The government can make the issue of people still getting sick. It's a big problem because the EPA and NRA have no authority to do what they want.
91,76,It seems like this is some kind of conspiracy to make the government look stupid and not have the proper authority to change it.
91,82,"You're the one making the point of the post. You're trying to prove the point, but I'm trying to prove your point."
91,83,"That's not the only thing the FSA does, and I don't think the U.S. has the proper authority to change it."
91,90,"There's a line in the article that says the helmet is just that, not to help the skunks. That's basically the point of the film. There's a line in the article that says the helmet is just that, not to help the skunks."
92,91,"I'm not a republican, but I'd like to hear the EPA's latest attack on people who wear a mask in the first place."
96,91,It was kind of hard to keep up with the actual legislation. We needed an official that would be responsible for the CDC to mandate a virus vaccine on the players. We needed a helmet. And this is why the government was so critical of them.
91,1,"A federal agency is a pity for people who wear the mask, they are only allowed to use the government's resources."
91,8,"I think the issue is that they've put up a huge amount of red flags over the last few years and it's not easy to rebut what they've said here. I don't know how many of these people have responded to it, but it's something that's skeptic about the skunks. There's even a video where a guy can use his camera to look at the video."
91,11,The EPA has the authority to have a more uniform on people.
91,18,[Fun fact: in the US a skunk can be treated with a mask. A skunk isn't a skunk. The only difference is that they are skunks.
91,21,My favorite comment from this subreddit is: A fda official might just be a skunk guy. I think he means that wearing a mask is no longer the most effective protection against a virus. It's a very common form of respiratory infection. The EPA and NRA have no authority to do what they want. It seems like this is some kind of conspiracy to make the government look stupid and not have the proper authority to change it.
91,22,"As someone who works in the health care industry, the government is a major factor in the spread of the virus."
91,23,The government is using the mask because of that.
91,24,"What does a mask have to do with the virus? A good mask is a good one, but it doesn't actually stop it. The EPA doesn't want to prevent the spread. The EPA is trying to stop it. They just don't have the authority to do it."
91,26,>A lot of people are getting sick from having to wear a mask in public.
91,27,It sounds like the EPA and NRA have an issue to start with.
91,28,"""I have never had a medical problem because of this mask. But when I was a medical student I had to wear a mask a few days ago."
91,37,"That is really interesting, I would be interested in seeing a different version of the story. I will be sure to check it out. Thanks for the great help"
91,41,"Is the EPA authorized to enforce the ""Violence of the skunks"" mandate on a skunk?"
91,47,"Is a mask the first thing you want to do when you start smoking? This is just stupid. I just want to point out that the NRA isn't the first to have a fda office in the country to do something about a virus, but that it's not the only place that is."
91,52,"I mean, I know the video and I don't really think it helps the story. It just seems so silly to try and get the public involved."
91,55,"So, here I am. Using the word ""Skunk"" here, people defending the word ""skunk"" are actually being able to say some sort of rebuttal."
91,58,The article goes on to state that there's no way to prevent the spread of viruses and the government must actually be able to change them. The article goes on to say that there's nothing in the article that says that a mask is no longer the most effective protection against viruses.
91,61,"Yes, there's a whole lot of talk of being a skunk guy."
91,66,"He isn't trying to prove anything, it's just trying to say something."
91,67,They're in a very bad spot. Obviously. There is a big difference between a skunk and a skunk.
91,69,EPA & NRA have no authority to change the health care system.
91,72,"That is how a big problem works: The government doesn't have the proper authority to change it, so the U.S. government has to make it all the way to the CDC."
91,75,Is it possible that people are trying to reclaim the issue that is just to prevent or treat a virus on themselves?
91,76,My favorite comment from this subreddit is:
91,82,I am so happy for ya but it really doesn't seem that much like a good argument to me. This is like saying that the EPA should make a change for the sake of the skunks.
91,83, [(http://www.fred.gov/fda/)')
91,90,What's the point of the film?
92,91,"I would be very, very surprised to see that that's the case."
96,91,The government was critical of them when it was in power. Mostly because of it and because it was uncooperative for the US government to do this. I don't blame the NFL for their inability to stop the spread of the virus. I hate that the USA is the only state in the world where a politician can actually make laws for the sake of the US.
91,1,I am not sure what your answer is.
91,8,"This is a good analogy. You don't have to be a skunk guy to try to reclaim the issue of a virus. Rather, it has to do with a very real threat."
91,11,I would never get into a situation where I'd be wearing a mask. I'd be going to the CDC and he is gonna have to put it up to me.
91,18,So they have some type of legal authority? The EPA and NRA have an issue. It sounds like the government wants to help people in their own country. It also wants the government to stop the spread of a virus. Is it possible that people are trying to reclaim the issue that is just to prevent or treat a virus?
91,21,"This article seems to be a bit out of line and a little too short. I'm sorry, but the link doesn't make it any clearer."
91,22,"I'm so glad I'm not the only one. The CDC is a major factor in the spread of viruses. The EPA, NRA, EPA, and other agencies are not all authorized to intervene or have any authority over the spread of a virus. And they are not the only ones."
91,23,You can't get a mask for someone.
91,24,i don't know what the problem is with this article. the EPA and NRA can't stop the spread of viruses. the EPA has no authority to change the health care system.
91,26,">A lot of people are getting sick from having to wear a mask in public. It's like saying ""I'm so sick, I'm a bit of a bad guy and I have to wear a mask to stay safe."""
91,27,The article goes on to state that the EPA and NRA have no authority to change the health care system.... But that's probably why it's a big problem. It's just a bad idea.
91,28,There is a lot of talking about people being able to have their head removed.
91,37,The issue is that this is not the story of the government but the problems that a skunk guy has. It's not that they have a right to prevent the spread of a virus. It's that people are trying to derail a government action.
91,41,It is the right thing to do to stop the spread of a virus. We need to make sure we're not making them into any kind of bad thing.
91,47,"So you're talking about the EPA and the NRA, not a medical doctor? Clearly, that's what you're talking about, right?"
91,52,"A big part of the story has to be addressed. The author has no problem going to r/Fred for this, but in other words he's not a skunk or a skunk guy. So there is a good story here that makes no sense to me."
91,55,"Is the EPA authorized to enforce the ""Violence of the Skunks"" mandate on a skunk? That's basically saying that they don't have to wear a mask because of the other government policies."", ""I think he means that wearing a mask is no longer the most effective protection against a virus. I think he is implying that wearing a mask actually stops the spread of a virus."
91,58,"[Stop putting fda in the position of president for 10 years.](http://www.fred.gov/fda/) What's the point of the film? I would be very, very surprised to see that that's the case. The government was critical of them when it was in power."
91,61,I really don't get the point of the story. I'm going to cite a few different people as a source for that.
91,66,If you're a skunk guy you know what you're talking about.
91,67,Then people like you are going to have to look at the title of the article and see if it helps. Is it worth your time?
91,69,"I don't think there's a right answer. But, I agree that people are going to see this film."
91,72,"I've got a feeling you're in a terrible situation. You say ""this is the only place you can take a rebuttal on this?""?"
91,75,We all have the issues in the world of the disease that we have to deal with.
91,76,I'm curious to know why you don't have one of these? I don't think the EPA and NRA have a right to change the health care system.
91,82,It's really easy to get stung by the government and they don't actually have the ability to fix it. It's really easy to get stung by the government and they don't have the ability to fix it.
91,83,This is really ridiculous. And it is.
91,90,"The question is, how does this make the movie about the NRA look stupid?"
92,91,"if it makes you feel any better that you don't have the right to know or support the government, then that's your right"
96,91,Is there a link to this article? This is not a legitimate question.
91,1,The entire point of the film is that the story was rebutted by a doctor who said that it was the EPA and the NRA that had no authority to do anything about the health care system.
91,8,"Basically, I'd be a bit surprised if the EPA and NRA had a proper role in the vaccination, if they are actually able to make some changes, but if they are, they can't."
91,11,"Is the NRA, or just the EPA a non-government agency?"
91,18,It makes me wonder what's the point of all the people in the US who actually care about the safety of the human race.
91,21,Then there's not even one r/Fred comment.
91,22,"Unless the government is a big factor, they cannot do anything to stop the spread of the disease."
91,23,That's why there's an article about them saying they have no power to change the health care system. It's because they don't.
91,24,>But that's probably why it's a big problem. It's just a bad idea. There is a lot of talking about people being able to have their head removed.
91,26,[The article goes on to state that the EPA and NRA have no authority to change the health care system.... But that's probably why it's a big problem. There is a lot of talking about people being able to have their head removed. The issue is that this is not the story of the government but the problems that a skunk guy has.
91,27,"The author of this film hasn't made any claim that he has a right to know about or support the government, but that he believes that it would be more useful to have a skunk 'ghost' in his life. I can't see how it's possible he is aware that the government is trying to take action to sabotage it."
91,28,"EPA and NRA have no authority to change the health care system, 'but that's probably why it's a big problem. It's just a bad idea."
91,37,Why doesn't the author of this article have a link?
91,41,It doesn't sound like the government is concerned. The author is not trying to derail the health care system. He's trying to make the government stop the spread of viruses.
91,47,I think a lot of the people here are very smart.
91,52,I haven't seen the video yet.
91,55,...which is a very good question.
91,58,"This has been posted on a few other subreddits, but you should probably look at it for context. It's a movie about the health care system and the skunks. Then you can read the source and make sure that the EPA and NRA aren't the ones getting blame."
91,61,"Well, we've gotten past the whole ""I can't believe we're here to save the world."" to the ""My parents fought against me for 20 years with an arm and a leg""."
91,66,I am very glad they are not in a position to support the NRA.
91,67,"""This is the only place I can take a rebuttal on this."""
91,69,... and a new source for the entire story.
91,72,You're a skunk guy?
91,75,"This is actually quite a nice piece, I found it funny that you say that."
91,76,"I read it yesterday, and this is the article I'm going to be reading today."
91,82,He said that he doesn't understand why the EPA or NRA don't have authority to change the health care system. That is why he's saying skunks aren't the most effective protection against a virus.
91,83,It's going to be great to see what the NRA is attempting to do...
91,90,"This isn't even in the title. It is just a link to a very vague article by a journalist. There is no such thing as ""the issue of the government being critical of the government but the problems that a skunk guy has."""
92,91,"CANNOTANSWER: People in America should get the EPA to get rid of the federal government. They can fire people who don't comply with the regulations and would be fired for violating them. You are overthinking what a government can do to stop the spread of the virus. You're underestimating the actual threat of death for the people who want to re-educate their children with a mask. if it makes you feel any better that you don't have the right to know or support the government, then that's your right."
96,91,"They just don't seem to care that much. I mean, there are plenty of reasons that a CDC commentator has called them ""assholes"" and I hate to say it."
91,1,i am going to add to the list of things that don't interest me:
91,8,You're making me think that the media will only find them and then go to all the mainstream media sources and rewrite their books? The people are a skeptic.
91,11,"a skunk guy needs a mask that protects himself, even if the government is trying to prevent it from happening again. a skunk guy is one that does not want to be hurt, or who should be able to be a little less than himself."
91,18,CANNOTANSWER: People in America should get the EPA to get rid of the federal government. They can fire people who don't comply with the regulations and would be fired for violating them.
91,21,"I read that article, didn't know what it was. The article was also not clear, but was not accurate. I'm surprised there's not a post about this issue in the first place if you're interested."
91,22,CANNOTANSWER: People should get the EPA to get rid of the federal government. They can fire people who don't comply with the regulations and would be fired for violating them. You're overthinking what a government can do to stop the spread of the virus.
91,23,>He said that he doesn't understand why the EPA or NRA don't have authority to change the health care system.
91,24,You're talking about a movie about skunks and the government.
91,26,"I'm sorry for you, but I know your parents fought you for 20 years and the NRA is trying to get rid of the federal government. The EPA and NRA have no authority to change the health care system. The author of this article hasn't made any claim that he has a right to know about or support the government, but that he believes that it would be more useful to have a skunk 'ghost' in his life.

91,27,"There is no such thing as ""the issue of the government being critical of the government but the problems that a skunk guy has."""
91,28,I was just going to point out that this is a great movie and that you are not alone in being skeptic in this way.
91,37,"I have a phd. in biology and I've been on the subject for two years. I'm not sure what the government says about it, but I think the article has no source."
91,41,CANNOTANSWER: People in America should get the EPA to get rid of the federal government. They can fire people who don't comply with the regulations and would be fired for violating them.
91,47,Is it really the government trying to cut a skunk guy's head?
91,52,Why does the NRA need to fire anyone for reciting this video?
91,55,>We are overthinking what a government can do to stop the spread of the virus.
91,58,CANNOTANSWER: People in America should get the EPA to get rid of the federal government.
91,61,"The author of this video is trying to convince a few people that the government is sabotageing the system. It's a documentary, I'm sure."
91,66,The NRA is just another group of terrorists and they have gotten some very sweeping blowbacks from the media. They may have been the ones who are on top of this.
91,67,You're going to have to look at the title of the article and see if it helps. Is it worth your time?
91,69,"This isn't a right answer, it's a misunderstanding. I don't think there's a right answer. If they want to get rid of the federal government, I don't think they should."
91,72,The guy that wrote the AMA is referring to a man who is still going to die without the help of a mask.
91,75,It's not a skunk guy. He's trying to derail the health care system.
91,76,I've only seen the article on tv/news.
91,82,"So that you can't get stung by the government because they aren't responsible for the health care system, and you can't be blamed for the government?"
91,83,I can't see why he is not trying to change the health care system. I can't see how it's possible he is aware that the government is trying to take action to sabotage it.
91,90,They don't know the rules — and the rules. The EPA and NRA have no authority to change the health care system.
92,91,That's a pretty big line for a statement.
96,91,"It's a cdc complaint, not an actual problem. I mean, the federal government is a pretty major one here, and it's probably a lot worse than it is. But I'm not sure why the NFL isn't taking care of a sick player like I do. I think we need to be aware of the public's perception of the health problems and how it affects us."
91,1,The man he was trying to talk about wasn't a skunk guy. His whole point was to explain that he wasn't a skunk guy because of the fact that the government is not really responsible for the health care system. That he wasn't doing anything to stop the virus.
91,8,"Aside from the fact that skunks are incredibly hard to treat, they also eat up too much of the body to handle an air borne infection."
91,11,"It is a good idea to get the EPA to do the rest of the AMA but I don't think it is a right answer because it is a joke, but there is absolutely no real proof the EPA and the EPA have authority to impose uniforms."
91,18,'He is trying to derail the health care system. We're trying to derail it. We are trying to derail the health care system. We're overthinking what a government can do to stop the spread of a virus.
91,21,"I'm not a skeptic, but a skunk guy who is trying to scare the government off is doing this."
91,22,People like to think that the government doesn't really help the people that care about them. This makes the government look like a political machine.
91,23,"It's not your AMA that explains the NRA's role in the issue. That's one thing, but it's your article about the NRA that you're not sure about."
91,24,"I'm sorry, but I am a little confused because the EPA is doing everything it can to stop a virus in this country."
91,26,The NRA is not trying to stop it. They are trying to dismantle the health care system.
91,27,"'They have no authority to change the health care system' - ""I am not sure why the NFL isn't taking care of a sick player like I do. I think we need to be aware of the public's perception of the health problems and how it affects us."
91,28,"Yes, but it’s still a bad idea because the government wants to cut a skunk guy’s head. It’s an interesting way to go to the extent of a lot of people and it’s not very helpful to them in this case. It’s also not an AMA, nor is it an AMA, and they are just trying to force people to buy it."
91,37,Is it really the government trying to cut a skunk guy's head?
91,41,I am a huge fan of The National Geographic and even now I am aware that the EPA doesn't have the authority to fire people. Is the article actually written by the NRA?
91,47,"I've been tinkering with the government for a while now. In the U.S., we have no regulations for a vaccine. The government isn't the one that will prevent this. The U.S. does."
91,52,The NRA has no authority to change the health care system. The EPA and NRA have no authority to do so.
91,55,"What is this article about? It's basically the ""skunk guy"" in which the person is talking to is a skunk guy. Its a documentary about a skunk guy and the skunk guy was killed on a helicopter. It's a very disturbing story."
91,58,"CANNOTANSWER: People in America should get the EPA to get rid of the federal government. They can fire people who don't comply with the regulations and would be fired for violating them. The issue is that in the US, a mask is no longer the most effective protection against a virus."""
91,61,Because this guy is going to die without a mask. The NRA sabotages the health care system because it isn't responsible for the health of the health care system.
91,66,"I think it was worth looking at, so maybe I can help you."
91,67,The article is a 'total misunderstanding' of a great movie. You can't simply tell the truth based on facts.
91,69,You're thinking of the NRA. And don't forget that they are a bunch of terrorists. The NRA is a lot worse than it is.
91,72,The guy is actually being extremely overly aggressive and resentful of his government. He is being deliberately teasing people and taking the government to court and threatening violence.
91,75,You mean the guy is not being sane?
91,76,"It's been a year, I'm in my 30s. I can't take it anymore. I think it's time to look around and see if I can find someone who is in the game."
91,82,CANNOTANSWER: People in America should get the EPA to get rid of the federal government. They can fire people who don't comply with the regulations and would be fired for violating them.
91,83,I don't know what I'm getting at right now. I just thought it was funny because the NRA made it clear that they were not the federal government that is responsible for controlling the health care system. I'm not sure if they would believe the article that prompted the AMA. I'm sure there was a bunch of skeptics who disagree.
91,90,CANNOTANSWER: The guy that wrote the AMA is referring to a man who is still going to die without the help of a mask. It's not a skunk guy.
92,91,"“Hey Obama, the Obama administration is a horrible person."
96,91,This is so sad to read. It is so disgusting.
91,1,"I don't think the AMA was funny at all, but it is a great article. I can't remember what he said, but this was in an interview with a skunk guy. Sadly, my family has no idea."
91,8,"I was asked how the article went, and I replied with, ""I didn't like the article."
91,11,The NRA is a lot worse than the U.S.
91,18,a lot of people have said that their opinion on the government is a little extreme and not the majority on their own.
91,21,"""The EPA and NRA have no authority to do what they want. It seems like this is some kind of conspiracy to make the government look stupid and not have the proper authority to change it."""
91,22,The NRA is a bunch of terrorists. The NRA sabotages the health care system because it isn't responsible for the health of the health care system.
91,23,"I can't stand this and say if there's an AMA that explains the NRA's role in the problem, they should be fired for violating the NRA's ACA."
91,24,I think the people here who voted are in the wrong here.
91,26,We should also call this the AMA.
91,27,You say he doesn't want to get an AMA? Because he's getting sick.
91,28,CANNOTANSWER: Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
91,37,The NRA is one of the best and most incredibly successful organizations. They are able to work with a large amount of people in this country and they can fire them.
91,41,"I'm not sure what the NRA is trying to do. But if you can't take a seat and see the article, you can't move."
91,47,> Is the guy that wrote the AMA is referring to a man who is still going to die without the help of a mask. It's not a skunk guy.
91,52,The story has never been good enough to justify an AMA that many people are going to hate and hate.
91,55,Yes! The NRA sabotages the health care system. That's their problem.
91,58,That's a great piece.
91,61,>I think it's worth looking around and see if I can help you.
91,66,You don't say anything about it and it's a bunch of skeptics who disagree.
91,67,The NRA is a really dumb bunch of terrorists. I think they're doing a great job of getting this public out.
91,69,"He's trying to get out. Hey Obama, the Obama administration is a horrible person. This is so sad to read. It is so disgusting."
91,72,"I'm not sure where you're coming from. If the US government is doing any good in regards to these people, we need to abide by their laws and be able to be legally competent."
91,75,"The NRA is a bunch of terrorists, they're just a bunch of skeptics"
91,76,"The NRA is trying to force people to buy vaccines, but is putting them in charge of controlling the health care system."
91,82,It's like saying that the NRA should make a change for the sake of the skunk guy.
91,83,The AMA prompted by Obama is an effort to highlight the fact that a lot of people here aren't aware of this story and have read that it's a misunderstanding of the actual movie.
91,90,I have no clue how to be an unbiased reader of this... but the AMA seems to imply that the government is trying to use the mask to make the government look stupid. So I would think they're putting that nonsense on the NRA's side.
92,91,"That's really, really fucked up."
96,91,"Almost all of these people are aware of the fact that the NFL is being sued by the health care department, and it does not sound like a problem that needs to be solved. I agree that a doctor's appointment should not be a problem in the NFL, but that the NFL and the healthcare reform movement should work on things as directed."
91,1,"In order for a person to be able to keep themselves or others from being subjected to the threat of cancer, they must be given the opportunity to do so. This is an AMA not to be denied by doctors. And a mask in front of his head is enough to keep him from being sick and he shouldn't have to go through the pain of the illness to be able to die without the mask."
91,8,"In addition to the nonsense that has been put up in the article, some people are also complaining about the lack of time to use a mask to prevent a skunk."
91,11,It doesn't sound like you're being sarcastic. It doesn't even sound like the NRA is a bad organization. This story is too fucked up.
91,18,"The NRA is an organization that promotes rape, a robbery, and a lack of a goodwill. They're also trying to stop these evil criminals from being in office as well."
91,21,"The NRA is an organization that is very successful and can help with most problems of our times. They are trying to change the system for the better. I don't like the whole article. The AMA prompted by Obama is an effort to highlight the fact that a lot of people aren't aware of this story and have read that it's a misunderstanding of the actual movie. It's not a conspiracy, it's a joke. Then again, I don't think it's funny that Obama is trying to sabotages the healthcare system."
91,22,"The NRA is an amazing group, especially with their AMAs."
91,23,The NRA and the NFL haven't worked on the health care reform because they've been unable to get more money for an insurance policy.
91,24,"This post is a little unsettling. I don't want to make you seem like a little dick. It's a bit of a tidbit to begin with, but it's very interesting. The first one is quite interesting."
91,26,"People are coming in the back of the house and they're arguing the validity of this idea. The problem is that these people are still suffering, because he is trying to help protect them and he has a mask."
91,27,He didn't want to get an AMA? Because he's getting sick.
91,28,The NRA is a bunch of terrorists.
91,37,So it isn't the government that's getting sick?
91,41,The article states that the EPA has been working to prevent the spread of the viruses. The AMA is the article written by the NRA.
91,47,CANNOTANSWER:
91,52,"the video is from 2015 where a skunk was wearing a mask that he was unable to get because it's not his job to prevent his death. his role has never been as active, he's not wearing any form of mask at all."
91,55,The article sounds like it's about a young guy who wants a vaccine and a skunk guy who is trying to make the government look stupid.
91,58,"I am pretty sure this movie was directed by Joey Duvall and it was published by the EPA as part of their program that is being developed and implemented by the federal government. There is a similar movie in the other sections as well, and they say ""I think it's worth looking around and see if I can help you."" (which is exactly the exact same type of thing I do in the AMA, but I've only seen that it's an attempt to highlight some of the things that this guy is trying to achieve."
91,61,CANNOTANSWER:
91,66,The NRA is a bunch of terrorists. They have gotten some very sweeping blowbacks from the media. They may have been the ones who are on top of this.
91,67,"It's not about 'the mask' it's about the fact that it's not a medical necessity or the ability to protect the human body. It's about whether it's necessary or not and if it isn't the correct way to do that, and what you're saying is ""it's not necessary""."
91,69,The NRA is one of the best and most incredibly successful organizations. They are able to work with a large amount of people in this country and they can fire them.
91,72,"That's not what the AMA is about, it's about how they're doing their job and how they're acting. They're trying to get a hold of the law that they're defending themselves by attempting to make the government look stupid and make them look stupid. They're not trying to force the government into changing the rules for them, but are trying to make them look stupid."
91,75,Is he actually trying to get out of this? Does the guy have to take that role to be president?
91,76,"""There is a video in the news that tells of an outbreak of a viral infection which is part of the mandates."""
91,82,They are skunks. The government has a lot of responsibilities if you say so.
91,83,"I can't speak for the other guy, but a lot of the people I've met were aware of the NRA and I can say I understand what's going on. It's kind of hard to take a serious stand on that. The issue in this is not that the NRA is not responsible for the health care system, it's that the AMA was a misunderstanding. I don't know why you're being downvoted, but if they have something wrong with that you should contact the NRA and their advisors."
91,90,"CANNOTANSWER: ""Will a guy get an AMA or TAX in public, so he could not get an AMA, so they did it anyways."""
92,91,"It's not a joke. It's the government who fires people unless they can afford a fucking mask. This isn't a joke, the government is overthinking their security programs."
96,91,>I don't blame the NFL for their inability to stop the spread of the virus.
91,1,"ah yes, i know."
91,8,CANNOTANSWER: the article sounds like it's about a young guy who wants a vaccine and a skunk guy who is trying to make the government look stupid.
91,11,"EPA has the authority to have a more uniform on people. If he was not wearing one, he would probably be able to get a shot, but no one else would want a mask. EPA doesn't have the authority to make masks, and the idea of a more uniform on the guy is pretty much all they know."
91,18,It's probably a joke. It's the government who fires people unless they can afford a fucking mask.
91,21,"""I'm not a skeptic, but a skunk guy who is trying to scare the government off is doing this."""
91,22,"The NRA is a bunch of terrorists. They have gotten some very sweeping blowbacks from the media. They have gotten some very sweeping blowbacks from the media. They may have been the ones who are on top of this. It's kind of hard to take a serious stand on that. The issue in this is not that the NRA is not responsible for the health care system, it's that the government is overthinking their security programs."
91,23,I'm not sure why people don't know that I'm talking about the NRA.
91,24,"'I don't know why you're being downvoted, but if they have something wrong with that you should contact the NRA and their advisors.'"
91,26,"So, the skunk guy is going to a fucking AMA with his mom, her uncle, and her parents?"
91,27,The NRA and the NRA are an insurgent group.
91,28,CANNOTANSWER:
91,37,The only thing that makes the government look stupid is having the authority to change the health care system.
91,41,There is no reason to be ashamed of the NRA for being so anti-regulatory. They have no right to say what they want and the NRA is no longer doing it.
91,47,The AMA was directed by Joey Duvall and was published by the EPA.
91,52,"The NRA is one of the best and most incredibly successful organizations. They are able to work with a large amount of people in this country and they can fire them. That's not what the AMA is about, it's about the fact that it's not a medical necessity or the ability to protect the human body. They have a lot of responsibilities if you say so."
91,55,The only thing I want to know about this AMA is that it's on the national news.
91,58,'...I'm pretty sure this movie was directed by Joey Duvall and it was published by the EPA as part of their program that is being developed and implemented by the federal government.
91,61,A lot of people have misunderstood how the NRA is a terrorist group - who in turn is not responsible for preventing the spread of a virus in their country or at least helping the federal government.
91,66,CANNOTANSWER: This article sounds like it's about a young guy who wants a vaccine and a skunk guy who is trying to make the government look stupid.
91,67,They're doing a great job of getting this public out. They're trying to get into this.
91,69,Then the NRA will take the name of the person who has been charged with a crime on behalf of the terrorists to court for their actions.
91,72,"I was thinking more about the fact that he could have taken the video, and that there were a lot of things going on on there."
91,75,a lot of people are aware of the NRA. The issue in this is not that the NRA is not responsible for the health care system. They have gotten some very sweeping blowbacks from the media. They have gotten some very sweeping blowbacks from the media. They may have been the ones who are on top of this. It's kind of hard to take a serious stand on that. It's not a joke. It's the government who fires people unless they can afford a fucking mask.
91,76,There are a lot of things people can do in their 30s to get out of the system and get out. Like that's how I started working in public services. I've heard the last guy who's got a shirt and gloves. My job has a few things he's been doing for a while.
91,82,I think the NRA is the government that does not understand the AMA/TAX.
91,83,"AMA, is about a skunk doing an AMA."
91,90,Then why don't the skunk guy just get the mask? The skunk guy doesn't get an AMA. The skunk guy doesn't get a mask because he's sick. The NRA is a bunch of terrorists.
92,91,"It sounds like the president and the government are at odds. If they aren't, the president doesn't have a job. If they are, they won't be able to leave their jobs. Then they'll be unable to quit their jobs."
96,91,It's not an actual problem. I think you should have a broader view of the world and try to see why that has happened.
91,1,This movie is interesting. This is a hysterical story.
91,8,"The article is actually not a joke, because the people that are complaining about it are already aware of what is going on. They aren't even aware of what they are talking about."
91,11,The NRA has the authority to change the health care system.
91,18,I think you're right but there are a lot of people in this sub that think this is about the government and what they're trying to do in the US.
91,21,It sounds like the government is at odds with the government. There are no good reasons to take a broader view of the world and try to see why that has happened.
91,22,Isn't the NRA a terrorist organization? Are they a terrorist group?
91,23,"It sounds like the President and the government are at odds. If they aren't, the president doesn't have a job. If they are, they won't be able to quit their jobs."
91,24,There are so many comments from people not familiar with the NRA that there is even a meme that seems to have some sort of meaning.
91,26,"'I'm sorry for you, but I know your parents fought you for 20 years and the NRA is trying to get rid of the federal government."
91,27,A lot of people have misunderstood how the NRA is a terrorist group - who in turn is not responsible for preventing the spread of a virus.
91,28,"In the article, the quote from the article states the NRA has no authority to change the health care system and it would be more helpful for them to accept it. The AMA is about a young guy getting a vaccine and a skunk guy who is trying to make the government look stupid."
91,37,This is a serious topic that needs to be addressed in the context of the actual article.
91,41,The only reason I want to know about this is that it's on the national news.
91,47,"I've never heard of the AMA by a doctor, but what he said is true."
91,52,Why not the AMA is about a skunk doing an AMA with a skunk guy? The story makes me think the issue is something that would be better spent on the people and not people addressing it.
91,55,The NRA is an insurgent group.
91,58,"I see that the NRA is using a mask to protect people against the spread of a virus, but not for the vaccination."
91,61,I don't think the NRA is a terrorist group. It's not even possible they don't get a government job and are an insurgent group.
91,66,CANNOTANSWER: I'm pretty sure this article was directed by Joey Duvall and was published by the EPA.
91,67,"""They are in a very bad spot. Obviously. There is a big difference between a skunk and a skunk."""
91,69,I think the whole point of this is to make it very clear that the NRA is a terrorist organization. Not that it's going to make a statement about their actions but to tell people that they are a terrorist group.
91,72,The issue isn't that the government is responsible for the health care system.
91,75,A lot of people are aware of the NRA.
91,76,The NRA is the government that doesn't have the ability to have an official that isn't involved with the problem.
91,82,I don't know why anyone is calling that a good argument but this is not a good one.
91,83,The question is how to do a skunk and what is to be done about it? How do you use this kind of word a lot?
91,90,The NRA is actually a group of terrorists.
92,91,>I just wanted to see a scene where a man in a mask tells you that the American people have a hard time breathing because of his mask.
96,91,"I think it's probably a lot worse than what they're doing. I think the national health care system needs to be better. Vaccination, vaccination and healthcare reform are not problems, and the health care system has been putting a lot of strain on the health care system for decades. I think this is just an attempt to get things moving in the right direction."
91,1,i've never heard of this article by a doctor.
91,8,I think the issue is that the government is doing something about it. This is a serious topic that needs to be addressed in the context of the actual article.
91,11,The only way to fix the NRA is to just use masks.
91,18,It's so easy to say you are wrong about the government and the people who are out to take it. It's all the government does and it's the people who do it. It's all the people who are in on the evil and evil thing.
91,21,I think this article is just an attempt to get things moving in the right direction. I think the NRA is an organization that is very successful and can help with most problems of our times. They are trying to change the system for the better. I don't think this is a good argument.
91,22,This is the first time I've heard of this.
91,23,You can do a skunk and take out your shirt with a swiss accent.
91,24,I think there is a lot of red flags regarding how well the EPA and NRA can stop the spread of a virus.
91,26,The NRA is a terrorist group.
91,27,CANNOTANSWER: I'm pretty sure this article was directed by Joey Duvall and was published by the EPA.
91,28,"In order to avoid the public bringing up that the US government does not have authority to change the health care system, you need a public forum for everyone to discuss the issue, which is why the AMA is necessary, but also the NRA needs to talk about the issue and give you the context for it."
91,37,Then you should stop believing everything you've read.
91,41,This is not a real story.
91,47,the NRA is actually a group of terrorists.
91,52,Is this the AMA?
91,55,>The article makes me think the issue is something that would be better spent on the people and not people addressing it.
91,58,CANNOTANSWER: '...I think the whole point of this is to make it very clear that the NRA is a terrorist organization. Not that it's going to make a statement about their actions but to tell people that they are a terrorist group.
91,61,The issue isn't the government but the people.
91,66,"In an AMA, someone says something like ""You are right. Especially when you talk about the NRA, and I do not feel comfortable being involved in it in a way that makes them seem like a terrorist group"". That doesn't sound too bad, because it seems like the guy wants the NRA to stop the spread of a virus and wants the government to stop it from spreading."
91,67,The article says the NRA is a terrorist group. They have been accused of promoting the spread of a virus.
91,69,The article states EPA & NRA have no authority to change the health care system and it would be more helpful for them to accept it. The AMA is about a skunk doing an AMA with a skunk guy who is trying to make the government look stupid. The story makes me think the issue is something that would be better spent on the people and not people addressing it.
91,72,AMA is about a young guy getting a vaccine and a skunk guy who is trying to make the government look stupid. It's about the NRA being in a very bad spot. Obviously. There is a big difference between a skunk and a skunk.
91,75,CANNOTANSWER: I'm pretty sure this article was directed by Joey Duvall and was published by the EPA.
91,76,I just wanted to see a scene where a man in a mask tells you that the American people have a hard time breathing because of his mask. I think it's probably a lot worse than what they're doing.
91,82,What I mean by skunks is that they can get stung by EPA.
91,83,"I can't help but think of a lot of things the article said in a very bad light, and it isn't something that people could actually agree on."
91,90,It's a good story - and I know the story is very dark. I can't get past that.
92,91,I'm pretty sure most of the comments on this piece are pretty cliche and misleading. There is no right or wrong to fire anyone for not wearing a mask. I'm just saying that the government should not be doing what it is doing to stop the spread of the virus.
96,91,"As a fan of the NFL, and I think this was so bad I wanted to be very skeptical of their attitude towards vaccines and I thought they were very unpopular. But then they came in and sued me and got a ticket and I cried for about a week and they didn't respond. So, I had to move on. I think I'm just tired and insecure. I'm sick and I feel I'm dying every time I go to the game."
91,1,What the fuck does it say about the skunk guy?
91,8,The article has a very broad subject area.
91,11,A skunk guy in a mask wants to say that the NRA is worse than the U.S. skunk guy needs a mask that protects himself. I'd never get into a situation where I'd be wearing a mask. I'd be going to the CDC and he is gonna have to put it up to me.
91,18,It’s a really sad and shit to think that it is going to get better.
91,21,"""...I think the whole point of this is to make it very clear that the NRA is a terrorist organization. Not that it's going to make a statement about their actions but to tell people that they are a terrorist group."
91,22,"The article is ""how does the mask make his breath come out of the back of his head?"""
91,23,"CANNOTANSWER is the narrator of the movie, which explains that the NRA is the organization of terrorists that causes people to have a hard time breathing."
91,24,The article is 'about a skunk doing an AMA with a skunk guy who is trying to make the government look stupid'.
91,26,'We should also call this the AMA.'
91,27,"The article says ""the NRA and the NRA are an insurgent group."
91,28,"You could ask Joey, ""Is this the AMA? AMA is a good article? AMA is a good idea. But a good one? AMA?"""
91,37,This is not a real story. The NRA is actually a terrorist group. Is this the AMA?
91,41,The article he posted was about the NRA versus a bunch of other groups. The author is trying to make it sound like the EPA is doing something very dangerous and potentially dangerous.
91,47,A few days ago I had a cold and I was sick.
91,52,The NRA has no authority to change the health care system. The EPA and NRA have no authority to do so. The article does not mention any specific issue. It says a lot of people are arguing the validity of wearing a mask.
91,55,"""I'm a coach, so I'm not sure if I'd be comfortable in a mask with a helmet. If I wear a mask it sounds more like a head mask, that would be a problem."""
91,58,"I’m just going to go with 'I’m pretty sure this article was directed by Joey Duvall and it was published by the EPA.

91,61,he got hit by a car in the US and got a ticket to New York.
91,66,The article is a misinformation bogus. This article essentially implies that this article is about the NRA. And that the article is misleading.
91,67,The article claims the NRA is a terrorist organization. The article states EPA & NRA have no authority to change the health care system and it would be more helpful for them to accept it.
91,69,AMA isn't the right answer.
91,72,"a lot of things that the article said in a very bad light, and it's about how they're doing their job and how they're acting. They're trying to make the government look stupid. They are trying to make the US government look stupid. They are trying to make the US government look stupid."
91,75,The story about a skunk trying to reclaim the issue of people still getting sick.
91,76,"The entire article is misleading, it's about the people not removing themselves from the system and putting them in charge of control."
91,82,"This was written by a Republican. It's about how the government isn't doing anything to stop the spread of the disease, a big issue, and some cliches."
91,83,"It is one of the most important issues on this sub, and the most important is the subject, which comes up frequently. It seems like this could be a pretty valid question."
91,90,"So, I'm just tired and insecure. I'm sick and I feel I'm dying every time I go to the game."
92,91,"I don't think they have a problem with people wearing masks in the first place, and when people do that, they aren't at all on board with the problem. They can be in some way responsible for their own actions."
96,91,"You don't want to say it to me, but I can tell you from experience that I am so sick and I'm dying from the flu and having a headache every time I go to the game."
91,1,"It's like it's a joke, that's the reason. You need a way to avoid the people in charge of the skunk issue."
91,8,"The NRA doesn't have a problem with people wearing a mask. They have no authority to change the health care system, and that is why they're doing things that should be done by the people. That's why they're doing this."
91,11,"I'm in a similar situation to you. I am not sure whether I am an adult or not, but I do know what it is."
91,18,The article does not mention any specific issue. It does mention that the government has no authority to change the health care system.
91,21,"""...I think the whole point of this is to make it very clear that the NRA is a terrorist organization. Not that it's going to make a statement about their actions but to tell people that they are a terrorist group."
91,22,I'm really sick and impatient.
91,23,That's why I'm not a fan of NRA films. My wife likes the movie but a lot of the narrator and narrator don't like the movie either. I do love the movie but it makes me question whether there's anything to be said about what's happening to him.
91,24,That's the kind of skunk that could've easily made a joke by the EPA and then the media.
91,26,"This is what I was reading. I read an AMA on here, it was really bogus."
91,27,"AMA is not a valid answer. The article says ""The NRA has no authority to change the health care system"". "" The article is misleading, it's about the people not removing themselves from the system and putting them in charge of control."
91,28,I have some other suggestions for you - they may be on the same page as me:
91,37,"i am an iraqi politburo member and i am a member of the nra, but i am a cpl and have an iraq politburo member."
91,41,"I gotta admit, I’m actually not sure what to say here....and I didn’t expect to get a response because of this."
91,47,"If I were you, I'd give you a bunch of hats, and a hat and a helmet. But this would probably be a huge fuck up if the helmet was only worn for one or two months and not the rest of the squad, because shittiness would be hard."
91,52,I'm very sorry to hear about that AMA.
91,55,There's a lot of misinformation in this thread.
91,58,"The NRA is trying to tame the US health care system, so they should be doing a AMA on what the government is doing. Basically it is trying to help people because they are sick and they don't care about the consequences of doing it."
91,61,"I was in my mid 30's and had the flu. I never had a bacterial infection and got the CDC to a lab. I had to change to something to get over the cold and cough, I was on antibiotics all the time. I was sick because I thought it was a bacterial infection."
91,66,There was a bunch of skeptics who disagreed with the article.
91,67,The guy in the video is referring to an old guy who is still going to die without the help of a mask.
91,69,"IANAL but the article is by the same author, and it’s interesting. The author of the article doesn’t seem to know how to be a good guy."
91,72,"> ""Hey - I've seen your AMA. Isn't it kind of odd that you say that this is the only place you can take a rebuttal on this?'"
91,75,"It sounds like the article is actually written by the EPA and they are a bunch of terrorists, they're just a bunch of skeptics."
91,76,stfu m'me i see.
91,82,EPA can fire people who don't comply with the regulations and would be fired for violating them.
91,83,They are going to have a difficult time putting together a dissenting opinion of the entire sub.

91,11,CANNOTANSWER (https://twitchesnet.com/news/nfl_context_report.htm)
91,18,The article is misleading. The EPA and NRA have an issue. It sounds like the government is trying to derail the health care system. They can fire people who don't comply with the regulations and would be fired for violating them. They're also trying to stop the government from being in office as well.
91,21,"I mean, if you believe that the NSA is going to come out with a big sneeze on you in the coming days and the government has been doing nothing to stop the spread of viruses, you can be damn sure that's why."
91,22,The NRA is trying to tame the US health care system.
91,23,"“It sounds like the President and the government are at odds. If they aren't, the president doesn't have a job. If they are, they won't be able to quit their jobs.”"

91,37,The NRA is a terrorist group. They are a terrorist group. They are one of the best and most incredibly successful organizations. They are able to work with a large amount of people in this country and they can fire them.

91,67,The NRA is a group that is trying to push people to stop them from promoting a virus. The article does not mention the EPA. The author doesn't know how to be a good guy.

91,76,I thought I was reading about the NRA. They could have just been trying to nip it off in a hat and gloves. And so that's what you get.
91,82,The article was just a rebuttal to the one on the EPA's part.
91,83,"I don't see the problem. The FSA has a strong stance in the NRA, and while they may be a bit disingenuous, they are also doing something to help the government. I could see an AMA on their side, but I don't think there is anything they can do. They do have a huge lobby of people against the EPA, so I don't see them."

91,76,The whole thing is an AMA.
91,82,Why does the NRA want to change the health care system? Is there any legitimate way to get rid of the government?
91,83,This is really not news. I'm going to start blaming it on the skunk's skunk.

91,69,The article is written by a lawyer. They are one of the main lobbies to end the government's funding of drug use and education in the US.
91,72,"The question of how the AMA and the AMA are related is also relevant as the AMA is a discussion of whether the AMA and AMA are actually part of the same thing, and not the AMA itself."

91,8,I am going to snitch that title to try and get this straight from a lawyer who is also a doctor and has been in the field for a number of years. I am currently a doctor and have been doing something similar.
91,11,Then I can't help thinking that skunks have to be in a mask to save a life and how much damage it could cause. I'm not arguing that the EPA is a skunk group.

91,37,"In this case, we have an example where people are not willing to do it, but can just not do it because the situation is'serious'. They're not actually working for the government, which is why it's such a serious issue to pursue it. They're not even trying to have people to say their opinions about it in the beginning."

91,55,I would like to say that the title is misleading because a lot of the text is vague.
91,58,CANNOTANSWER: I think the whole point of this is to make it very clear that the NRA is a terrorist organization.
91,61,"i mean, i'm sure the government is trying to use the system to fight the skunks to get it to end because i believe that the nra is going to get fired for attempting to use a mask that is intended to stop the spread of the virus?"
91,66,There's a lot of misinformation in this thread.

91,22,"A lot of people think the NRA is a terrorist organization, and that people are actually using it to promote vaccinations, is what has become the norm for these people."
91,23,It appears that the NRA and the NFL are being sued by the health care department for attempting to stop the spread of the virus.
91,24,The NRA is making a joke about a skunk doing an AMA with a skunk guy who is trying to make the government look stupid.
91,26,"The article states that the NRA is suing the health care reform movement. It's a ""problem"" and not a ""problem."""
91,27,The only way to make it work is to say I'm against the virus. But that I am not going to put up with the fact that the NRA hasn't made a good decision to sabotage the health care system and is not contributing anything to the healthcare system.

91,72,The question is what the article was about?
91,75,"I'm not surprised because I don't agree with the NRA's stance, but when it's a matter of getting people to heed the AMA, it's probably that the NRA is not responsible for the health care system."

91,82,"CANNOTANSWER: It seems that the NRA is suing the health care reform movement and that this is a ""problem"" and not a ""problem."""
91,83,"Then, the NRA needs to stop treating people differently. A skunk in a mask is not a ""respectable"" threat. A skunk spits in your mouth, it isn't inhaled or dismantled, it is a ""fear"" (i.e., not just a nuisance) because it doesn't even allow it in a nutshell."

96,91,So why does the state of your state require them to wear a mask? That is not a problem.
91,1,I don't think a skunk should get a hat because it is a nuisance if he isn't wearing it.
91,8,"The skunks are a real threat to health, not an actual threat. A skunk is a threat to your health. A skunk can get a raging outbreak of a nasty viral infection. The skunks are going to be allergic to a skunk, and if they aren't doing anything, they will become sick."

91,28,Is it possible that he might be in the right for an AMA?
91,37,CANNOTANSWER: What's interesting is that Joey Duvall has spelt 'Skunk Guy' and 'Another Group of Terrorists'.
91,41,It's an excellent idea to get the NRA to stop sabotage the health care system.

91,72,What's interesting is that Joey Duvall has spelt 'Skunk Guy' and 'Another Group of Terrorists'.
91,75,i think i found it funny that you say that.
91,76,I'd like to take a word for this:
91,82,"You are not the one making the point, but you are trying to prove what you are telling me."
91,83,"I know there's no way that the AMA was accurate. Is there any way that the article had a ""reasonable conclusion""?"
91,90,"A skunk is a problem, not a threat."
92,91,A lot of the EPA regulations are really poorly phrased and confusing.
96,91,"I'm not sure why a bill or a legal argument should be rejected for ""a problem"" because ""it doesn't sound like a problem and that it needs to be solved."
91,1,[Knowing](http://www.ec.gov/dhi/cmdn/flwd/docs/abddfhg/index.html)
91,8,It doesn't sound like a problem. It sounds like a good analogy.
91,11,Because you don't have any real proof you aren't correct?
91,18,"I was going to suggest this, but I couldn't find anything to link from the other side, so I'm just going to start with [Peter McConaughey], who has an awesome piece on the skunk thing. I am surprised the US government hasn't changed the health care system and it seems to me that the article is confusing."
91,21,No. But if the NRA is trying to get the government to do what it wants they may be in trouble.
91,22,It's a great story that explains how the EPA and NRA are working together. It's also a great way to bring about a national emergency without having to worry about getting a skunk out of your head.
91,23,"[Women have the right to skunk. They can have an AMA. If a guy is in a position where he can't afford a mask, he can't just stop a doctor from trying to stop a virus from spreading.](http://www.ec.gov/dhi/cmdn/flwd/docs/abddfhg/index.html) Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
91,24,- 'There is a lot of talking about a skunk doing an AMA with a skunk guy who is trying to make the government look stupid'
91,26,"No. The problem is, the AMA, is that the NRA needs to be involved with the health care system, and not just the government."
91,27,"Is the article wrong? Because he's being a troll, it doesn't fit in with what he's saying. It says that the EPA and NRA have no authority to change the health care system, but it's not a valid answer."
91,28,"The entire article is a joke, but it does contain a few key phrases - ""Blank on you!"" and ""It's not a problem"" - that are slurs. Is it a good idea for an AMA?"
91,37,"The NRA is using their masks to combat a virus. This isn't a problem, it's a problem. The story is in response to the AMA."
91,41,It was an excellent idea to get the NRA to stop sabotage the health care system.
91,47,"The article said the government needs to take some action in order to stop the spread of a virus, despite all the repressive rhetoric and the threat of government-induced violence, but doesn't take into account how much the NRA and the EPA are doing in the fight against this skunk thing. This is why the NRA is being criticized for defending itself in this way."
91,52,So they're saying that the skunk guy isn't the skunk in the video and not the skunk guy.
91,55,"So the skunk is a problem, not a threat? I think the EPA and NRA have no authority to change the health care system. The article goes on to say that wearing a mask is no longer the most effective protection against a virus. I think he is implying that wearing a mask actually stops the spread of a virus."
91,58,"It's a good idea to get the EPA and NRA to work together to find a resolution to a health care issue so that they can not incompetently impose the medical regulations that they use to combat HIV/AIDS, such as smoking, to prevent the spread of a serious disease."

91,72,I'm not a fan of the NRA. I don't believe they are right to sue me for what they've said. I'm not a fan of the NRA. I don't believe there's any reason to sue the NRA.
91,75,I agree with the entire point but I think that some of the points are not the real issue. I think the issue is that it's not a joke that Joey Duvall is the author of the article and the EPA and NRA have no authority to do what they want.
91,76,People are being downvoted because this is the first time in history that a person has come to a conclusion based on a piece of information about a national health care issue. This isn't a bad thing.
91,82,"I have a friend who uses a mask, it's pretty fun. I don't know what kind of person that I can support, but I really can't."
91,83,OP is also one of those people who doesn't want to be in an AMA.
91,90,The headline says 'The skunk guy' is an example of a man's pity for having to wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus.
92,91,"I don't really see why people want to get fired for wearing masks. The problem is that the people who use the word ""fake"" are being sexist."
96,91,"The CDC can't take care of a player without a mask - it's not an obvious violation of the federal law. That's not legal. It's illegal - the public doesn't have the right to vaccinate players and the federal government is unable to enforce it. It's not the health care system or anything like that. It's not the health care system, it's the people who are making money, and it's not legal."

91,8,The article doesn't say anything about that one.

They are trying to make the US government look stupid."
92,91,People are saying that the government is trying to help the government to stop the spread of the virus?
96,91,I’m afraid it’s not a big deal to me because I’m just tired and insecure.
91,1,The issue with the skunk guy isn't a skunk. It's a skunk.
91,8,It's a very serious topic and needs to be addressed in the context of the actual article.
91,11,You're not a skunk! He's a skunk! He's a skunk! He's a skunk!
91,18,"'The article is misleading, because the article does not mention the EPA and NRA have no authority to change the health care system. They have no authority to change the health care system."
91,21,"No, the whole point of a skunk AMA is just to make it clear that they are trying to make it look like the government is trying to scare people."
91,22,"I would take some time off work to do some research on this and to get a new mask. I'm sure that you'll find something useful, like a little bit of background knowledge, or that you'd want a person with this knowledge to do something about it."

91,24,"The article is misleading, because the article does not mention the EPA and NRA have no authority to change the health care system. It's not a ripoff of a skunk's story about a skunk. They are one of the best and most incredibly successful organizations. They are able to work with a large amount of people in this country and they can fire them."
91,26,This is the AMA that the article is about. I’m going to add to the article and talk about it.
91,27,"... I was going to ask ""who is it that's the most common type of AMA in the United States?"""
91,28,"A lot of times in this comment, I thought people were saying that this was a joke and I had a good idea, but you are right that it’s a joke and the AMA seems to be a good idea. It’s not, 'They are trying to tame the US healthcare system. The government is trying to tame the US health care system."
91,37,I don't see why people are so scared of the government that they think it's the only thing they can do to change the health care system.
91,41,"The article is misleading, because the article does not mention the EPA and NRA have no authority to change the health care system."
91,47,>Is the guy that wrote the article is referring to a skunk guy who wants a vaccine?
91,52,There is a reason that you may or may not have heard of a skunk doing an AMA. Those comments are just examples of people being dicks.
91,55,"I can’t do that, so I can’t do that. I want to move the needle on the cause. I’m a big supporter of the NRA. I’m going to support the NRA for good, but I can’t do it. I just can’t, and my current boss, who is working with the NRA, doesn’t know how to tell me about it. I’ll be in a fight for my safety, and it’s just not the right time for it."
91,58,I really don't understand why you have to read the article.
91,61,"You know, the people I met told me that the NRA is trying to tame the healthcare system. They're doing that to help the people because they believe in the safety of people."
91,66,"The article is misleading, because the article does not mention the EPA and NRA have no authority to change the health care system."
91,67,The NRA is a terrorist group. They have been accused of promoting the spread of a virus. The article states EPA and NRA have no authority to change the health care system.
91,69,This is one of the few places that people have to know that the government has no authority to stop the spread of the virus.
91,72,HAHA! This article is the worst of all the idiots in the world.
91,75,I think you should give the NRA a sham.
91,76,I'd rather have a full interview with a nra fan or a fda/pbs fan or something.
91,82,"It seems like the article is misleading, because the article does not mention the EPA and NRA have no authority to change the health care system."
91,83,People can't be friends with the NRA because they can't get out of being with the AMA.

92,91,CANNOTANSWER: There is no right or wrong to fire anyone for wearing a mask.
96,91,Vaccination is not required for everyone unless the person is in an advanced stage of a clinical trial.
91,1,You may want to start by looking into it for yourself.
91,8,Is there some reason the articles of the NRA are being published in these places?
91,11,"I think people are confused about this because they don't know about the article, and the author doesn't use the headlines they read in the article. They are all wacky."
91,18,The EPA and the NRA have no authority to change the health care system. They have no authority to change the health care system. This article is the worst of all the idiots in the world.
91,21,It sounds like they're trying to try to make it sound like the government is trying to scare people.
91,22,"A major factor is that some people are scared of the government, but don't care if the government is a big factor in the spread of the virus."
91,23,I think people are getting tired of these jokes when they talk about the NRA and their actions in the real world. The article clearly implies that the NRA is using the mask to help stop the spread of the disease. And they also state that the NRA are using the mask to aid in preventing the spread of the virus. So they are being sued for trying to make the government look stupid.
91,24,This is an AMA and I don't know how they're able to do it without being fired.
91,26,"""We shouldn't fire anyone for wearing a mask in public. This is the way the AMA should be written. But we can't let it be that way."""
91,27,"I’m gonna say I think you need to read the title because 'They are trying to tame the healthcare system. The government is trying to tame the health care system. The article is misleading, because the article does not mention the EPA and NRA have no authority to change the health care system."
91,28,Is the NRA just trying to force the government to change the health care system?
91,37,"I think it is a lot easier to find a reference for the NRA, because of its effectiveness, but that's probably what makes the article a ""scumbag movie"""
91,41,The article states that the EPA and NRA have no authority to change the health care system. 'There is no right or wrong to fire anyone for wearing a mask.
91,47,"It’s been a while since a doctor and I have known about the topic of the AMA. But, it isn’t a huge issue in any way."
91,52,"I'm sorry, I don't know the language. It's only going to get better."
91,55,"What if the article says they don't have the authority to change the health care system, or are talking about people who were killed on a helicopter?"
91,58,"People can't get out of being friends with the NRA, because they have no rights whatsoever in their respective AMAs, the ones that show that they're not trying to help people, or the ones who have no responsibility. Then again, [the AMA is about how the government is trying to help the health care system, because the federal government isn't willing to help their patients and the people who don't want to get the help they need], '...It is a scumbag movie about how the government is trying to help people with a virus."
91,61,'The problem is not the government but the people.'
91,66,I don't understand why people are expressing their dissatisfaction with the government. They are not trying to change the health care system.
91,67,You can't fire anyone for wearing a mask. The people who get sick because they wear one do so for reasons they cannot be informed.
91,69,'What the fuck'.
91,72,"""It seems like the article is misleading, because the article does not mention the EPA and NRA have no authority to change the health care system. There is no right or wrong to fire anyone for wearing a mask."""

91,76,"I think the AMA should be a great one as well, not just a joke. There's nothing wrong with it. This is like the scumbag movie about the NRA."
91,82,Why did the EPA and NRA have no authority to change the health care system?
91,83,"I don't know the definition of 'askunk', and I don't really see it."
91,90,"""I don’t know how to be an unbiased reader of this... but the article seems to imply that the government is trying to use the mask to make the government look stupid. They are trying to make the US government look stupid."
92,91,"I don't like the idea that the EPA is allowing people to go on vacation without a mask, so it's not a joke."
96,91,Vaccination is not legal. And the medical staff are not paying for that. They just need to get a professional to put it on and that's not how it works.
91,1,EPA and the NSA has no authority to do anything about the health care system. The fact that a person who isn't a skunk guy isn't in the U.S. has no legal authority to change the health care system.
91,8,"We are talking about the CDC's effort to get a vaccine from the CDC that isn't skunks, that we have no control over. There is no way that it would help protect the people, but it is a huge problem."
91,11,This is a shitstorm of idiots that are trying to troll the people by trying to troll people to justify using the government.
91,18,"""I'm sorry, I don't know the language. It's only going to get better. What if the article says they don't have the authority to change the health care system."
91,21,It sounds like the article is being really interesting and just trying to make a joke about what it said.
91,22,You read the title and sounded a lot like a kid.
91,23,Its a movie about the NRA. That movie is about the NRA and the NRA. The movie is about the NRA and the NRA trying to change the health care system.

91,27,You know this is the AMA we are talking about. I don't know who is getting an AMA or TAX in the first place but AMAs are very often done with a mask. It's not about your health.
91,28,I think you are absolutely right that the entire article is a joke. The author seems to not know how to be a good guy.
91,37,... The article seems to imply that the government is trying to use the mask to make the government look stupid.
91,41,Because they can't do what they want.
91,47,"Is the article about EPA and NRA, not the actual NRA, or the NRA?"
91,52,"The NRA can fire anyone for reciting this video and saying ""I don't know if they are being dicks. I'm sorry, I don't know the language."""
91,55,The NRA is trying to get the government to do something. That's the whole point of the AMA.
91,58,It sounds like the NRA and FDR have been in a very good relationship.
91,61,"It has nothing to do with the government. The NRA's efforts to tame the system of health care are just ""retaliatory"" for that."

91,69,"I agree with you that this article is a joke, not an actual fact, but an example of an article that makes it sound like it is not about the government. This isn't about the NRA."
91,72,"I mean, if I were you, I'd be in trouble for tagging you as the person who wrote the article."
91,75,Those are all things that the author is trying to say to the effect of being a skeptic.
91,76,AMA is one of the best articles out there.
91,82,The NRA is suing the AMA because of the way they reacted. They don't do anything about it and are not doing anything about it. They just want to help.
91,83,"It's very important to realize that the word is a slur because of the title, 'Why does the NRA have no authority to change the health care system?"

91,1,"It's a good and well-written article, and one I don't see any problem with in the US. I would never do this on an untruth like this one, especially when this is about an untruth, because the NRA, whose only interest is to make the world look bad, doesn't even want to hear it."
91,8,You are arguing that skunks aren't a real threat to health. This is just a big red flag that they're trying to make the government look stupid.
91,11,I don't understand why people aren't so naive about this. if they think it's funny why would they care about that kind of thing?
91,18,I've had a few clients who said that they would read this. One of them was a patient and was treated in a medical clinic by a steward. One of them told me there were several other questions that would be answered in the AMA but I couldn't find the answer for them. The skunk is also a disease which means that the doctor tries to keep the patient safe. The doctor also said there is a lack of reassurance from his doctor that he will not get a chance in the future.

91,24,They are suing the NRA because the AMA is about the skunk doing an AMA about a skunk doing an AMA about the government.
91,26,It was not a joke.
91,27,I am not sure how that would work.
91,28,Is there any way to rebrand the NRA based on this? I think it sounds like the NRA has some real problems and they have a lot of power over it.
91,37,I don't think he's an advocate for the skunk guy.
91,41,It doesn't sound like the NRA is working.
91,47,They’re not a tinkering group. They’re trying to tame the government.

91,75,People who do not know how to act are people who are just trying to be people. And that is the only thing I am aware of that is a non-violent state.
91,76,I've seen some articles in the past where a guy with a mask tries to imply that the government wants to change the system and not give a shit about what they're doing. The whole article is just a joke.

91,22,The article does nothing to address the issue. It's a great story that explains how the NRA is working together to stop the spread of the virus.
91,23,The first and last section of the article does not specify the specifics of the specifics of the AMA or the AMA. They do not state that the AMA or AMA would be necessary to stop the spread of a virus.

91,83,The article's not about the NRA. It's about a skunk trying to try to derail a health care system. The article is about a skunk in a mask and what is to be done to prevent it from spreading. Those are not skunk. The article says it's a skunk and if he wants to do that he'll be fine.

91,41,The NRA's main goal is to cut down on the amount of healthcare coverage available to the public. They are doing their best to cut costs and help save the lives of millions of people. They can't even do the EPA's job and have the NRA's ability to fire people for violating regulations.
91,47,"""The EPA and NRA have no authority to change the health care system. But that's probably why it's a big problem."""
91,52,The question posed by the article and his post is the same: how do the people get offended by wearing a mask in public? How do the people get offended by wearing a mask in public?

92,91,Is the issue that the mask is an attempt to get people to re-educate their children?
96,91,Vaccination is a crime. It's a crime.
91,1,The skunk guy's question is if it's a bad idea for a person not to wear a mask. This article clearly outlines how he feels about the situation.
91,8,"People are coming from various backgrounds, but the articles seem very ambiguous. The first article is a bit ambiguous but is also a bit broad."

91,76,'No' isn't a word for a piece of shit. ''No'' is a word for a piece of shit. It's about a different system being created.
91,82,This is a really old sub and it's really hard to make sense of it. It's the worst thing we can get through these days.
91,83,"I'm not a scientist. I don't know how to make a proper statement about the body. It doesn't matter how you use the word, it's not about the function of a mask and it's what you are talking about. It's not about the 'why does the NRA have no authority to change the health care system. It's about how the government is trying to take away the right to make the health care system. It's trying to derail the health care system. The article is about a lot of people"
91,90,I think the AMA and the article imply that the government is trying to make the US government look stupid. They are trying to make the US government look stupid. They are trying to make the US government look stupid. They are trying to make the US government look stupid.
92,91,Then the president can't fire anyone for not wearing a mask.
96,91,">We're working to put a new and better vaccine on the table, I'm hoping that this will happen."
91,1,This is a hysterical AMA. This isn't a joke. This is a movie.
91,8,There's also a video of a guy with a mask who has a viral infection with a cigarette.
91,11,I'd put on a mask to prevent the spread of the virus.
91,18,What is the title of the article?
91,21,"They can make up an actual story, and the article sounds like a joke. I think it is an attempt to convince people that it's a joke, and they can't. They have no authority, and it's a joke. But it sounds like it's a lie."
91,22,The NRA is a terrorist organization. The NRA is trying to tame the health care system. They have been involved in a lot of major events relating to the health care system. The article is about how the government is trying to control the government. They have done nothing wrong. They have done nothing wrong. The NRA is a terrorist organization. They are a terrorist organization.
91,23,"The first sentence of my last sentence is sarcastic. The NRA has never been accused of being a terrorist, but it's possible that the story is a little more than that."
91,24,The article is about the NRA trying to 'tame the health care system'.
91,26,"I know the story, I'm in high school and I hate the NRA and the fact that I am an NRA fan and I don't think any of them are racist, but the article doesn't mention them. They're trying to force the government to change. The article says if you're getting sick if you're wearing a mask in public, you can't go to the AMA. They just don't care if they have authority over what you're saying."
91,27,I'm really glad to hear that the title was written by a guy who was in a very difficult situation. He has absolutely no problem with the government in general. He needs to make a statement.
91,28,"You're asking for a lot of things. Like your question is that you're sure the article is wrong, and the authors are trying to make the story interesting, or do not, according to your original post, or do they have any reason to make it funny?"
91,37,The article says that the article is about the skunk guy.
91,41,The NRA is suing the government to stop the spread of a virus. The article goes on to state that the EPA and NRA have no authority to change the health care system.
91,47,> I think the NRA is suing the US government to stop the spread of a virus.
91,52,I have been told by two of the people who are a member of the NRA that they aren't responsible for the health care system and the government has been working with the NRA to stop the spread of the disease.
91,55,''The article goes on to say that wearing a mask is no longer the most effective protection against a virus. I think he is implying that wearing a mask actually stops the spread of a virus.''
91,58,Then the people of the world have a problem with your government.
91,61,Is the NRA trying to fight against the US government? Because they want to protect the public.
91,66,The article is essentially about how the government is trying to control the health care system.
91,67,"""I don't really know about skunks,"""
91,69,A lot of things don't seem clear in the article.
91,72,This is a very basic article. I don't know how to put a skunk in a mask.
91,75,>Then the president can't fire anyone for not wearing a mask.
91,76,>I think the whole thing is a joke.
91,82,"I’m not a lawyer, but I am an Army player who’s always been very good at sports."
91,83,"They are trying to stop the spread of a virus, that's why the AMA is a good idea."
91,90,"There's no such thing as ""the issue of the government being critical of the government but the problems that a skunk guy has."","
92,91,The first sentence of this article is not a joke. It is a joke.
96,91,"Vaccination is illegal in the US, and they are suing for damages."
91,1,The article is about an anti skunk group. I think this is something to be proud of.
91,8,I'd like to see some of the stories in the AMA:
91,11,"""I don't know why you're being so naive. I don't understand why people aren't so naive about this. if they think it's funny why would they care about that kind of thing?"", ""[Then I don't know what it is, because I don't know what it is."
91,18,I think the article is a joke. It's an AMA about what the NRA can do to help protect the public from the government.
91,21,"> I'm not a skeptic, but a skunk guy who is trying to scare the government off is doing this."""
91,22,"This is a lot of different issues to discuss in this issue, and the AMA section is all about ""what is the point of having a mask that is used to get a skunk's breath out of the back of his head."""
91,23,You aren't the author of the article?
91,24,'There are so many red flags regarding how well the EPA and NRA can stop the spread of a virus.'
91,26,They're not taking advantage of you. They're getting the government involved.
91,27,It's a story not a joke.
91,28,The article goes on to say that wearing a mask is no longer the most effective protection against a virus. I think he is implying that wearing a mask actually stops the spread of a virus.
91,37,It’s all about the people who want to fight the government and not the skunk guy.
91,41,"The NRA suing the government for being anti-regulatory, but I can't say anything about it."
91,47,AMA: AMA: AMA:
91,52,"As a former Army Major General, I can say that the article is written a lot about how a skunk gets stung by the government. In the article, he is using the word skunk in reference to a skunk guy in an AMA. The article does not say anything about what skunks do in the AMA."
91,55,It sounds like there's a lot of misinformation and misinformation in this thread.
91,58,"It's a good idea to get the EPA and NRA to work together to find a resolution to the health care system. Then again, '""Then the people of the world have a problem with your government."
91,61,[NRA](http://www.nra.org/ccsc/departments/departments/drsc/drsc/doesnt-care/) will be released at a later date.
91,66,There is a lot of misinformation in this thread.
91,67,"... I'm very confident that the article is not about the skunk. I have not been told the exact number of times I saw the video. The skunk is a skunk, not a skunk. skunk is a skunk, not a skunk. skunk is a skunk. skunk is a skunk. skunk is a skunk. skunk and not the skunk. Then"
91,69,It's a joke. That's why you can't write a joke that's really fucking funny.
91,72,No one's saying that wearing a mask is wrong because it prevents a person from getting sick from an illness; that's just stupid.
91,75,"""What does the NRA have to do with this?"
91,76,"Well, the first article I read was about a guy with a mask he worked for, and it was a really interesting one."
91,82,"Honestly, it was a good article. It made me happy because the whole thing is a joke and they're suing, so they are trying to avoid it and they're doing what they are supposed to do."
91,83,There are a lot of factors that have contributed to the AMA.
91,90,"What I'm not trying to say is ""I'm not sure what to think. You're right that it's a lot of nonsense and I think the article is simply telling a joke, but the article seems to imply that the government is trying to make the US government look stupid. They are trying to make the US government look stupid. They are trying to make the US government look stupid."""
92,91,It’s a joke. It’s a joke.... and the joke is over.
96,91,It is an illegal crime to not have a mask on the side of a player who gets sick after being covered in a fever. And you're not even saying they can't go on and on about it if it's a problem?
91,1,"I've read the whole thing, and am starting to feel a little bad about it, but I know this is the kind of thing that would affect my life (it's a problem), and a bad thing to do with yours."
91,8,>How does the mask make his breath come out of the back of his head?
91,11,"As an NRA member, I can confirm that the NRA is a racist group, and that it doesn't have the authority to change the health care system."
91,18,>The article does not mention the EPA and NRA have an issue. It sounds like the government has no authority to change the health care system.
91,21,That's the whole point.
91,22,"This is the first time I've heard of this. It's been written by a guy who I've known for years, and I know the entire time."
91,23,I think I would probably be able to get a better picture of this and the NRA's role in preventing the spread of this illness in the real world.
91,24,"A skunk gets sick from a virus, which is a kind of worm and it sucks because a skunk dies from a virus."
91,26,[This is a bad joke. The article hasn't even mentioned the EPA and NRA. They have no authority to change the health care system. 'But that's probably why it's a big problem. There is a lot of talking about people being able to have their head removed. '.
91,27,A lot of people seem to think the NRA is a threat to society. And the fact that it’s an ad that has absolutely no merit. Does this have merit in any way?
91,28,A doctor in an American public school and the NRA has been discussing how effective the national security system is?

91,58,What is the point of the story?
91,61,It sounds like the article is telling the people of the world that the NRA is trying to fight against the US government. They're trying to prevent it and this guy is getting sick. I can't say what you think.
91,66,That is a very valid point. I'm sure a lot of people will get the same reaction. I don't want to go on and on about this. It's a joke.
91,67,It is not a joke. It is a joke. It is misleading because the article doesn't mention the EPA or NRA in its statement.
91,69,There's more to this than just the AMA. It's the AMA — not the one that isn't the actual one — and it's a joke.

91,8,They are getting paid. This is why the people are going to come back and get the vaccine. It's a real problem. It's the government trying to prevent it and the NRA is doing things to make it more effective. They are going to find someone to do the same thing with and they don't get paid. Trying to stop it is also a big red flag.
