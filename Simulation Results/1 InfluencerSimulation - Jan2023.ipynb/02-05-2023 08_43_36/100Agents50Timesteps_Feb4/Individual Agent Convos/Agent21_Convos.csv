38,21,i can relate to that as well
41,21,I hate to tell you that wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
52,21,We all know that wearing a mask isn't helpful in stopping the spread of a virus.

22,21,"Having a mask in your face or face could be a great way to prevent sickness and get the virus to go away. However, not being on the same page as you would be a great excuse to be a dick on the internet."
38,21,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
41,21,I think the whole point of a mask is to stop the spread of a virus.
52,21,Yes. I think they should be able to wear a mask for a reason.
54,21,You got the right idea. Wearing a mask outside or in your car is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
56,21,I'm not saying that the doctors aren't taking the health care industry seriously. They're trying to make money by getting people to wear masks and getting into a health care system. They are just being incompetent.
59,21,"You are not missing the point that you are describing. You are describing a specific issue - how do you get a virus to spread in a state that has laws about removing them? How does your state treat those that aren't. You have the right to decide which is the best solution. This is not something that is the best option for everyone, but it is also part of the policy. The mask and vaccines are different in each state, but that is still a valid concern for the state as an individual, and the best idea to make up for that."
61,21,I think this is a problem with the federal government.
70,21,I'd rather take a job. It's a career and it will end up costing him the same amount of money as a manager. That's fucking stupid.
91,21,It's a huge shit to be a 'cancer' but it's a big ain't it
96,21,">I have to be honest with you, I really don't get this either :)"
99,21,This guy is going to talk about the health benefits of wearing a mask. I wonder how hard that guy's hard time breathing would be if he was only wearing masks at one time in his life. I would really like to hear how this guy is having a hard time breathing and he's feeling better. Maybe he's just looking for some help. I've had some very good friends who have been to hospital. I would have been more than happy to have a doctor help them with a difficult or hard time breathing.
22,21,i think its useless that maroon and mcdonalds are avoiding the same problem
38,21,"I had a friend wear a mask, which was a joke that everyone was talking about and she said to go see a doctor and say the ""you need a mask"" line."
41,21,'Mask a doctor what you can about wearing a mask'
52,21,I'm not a fan of the idea. I'm just a guy.
54,21,">[We have always heard the phrase. ""I wear my mask when I m in public lawmaker who isn t wearing his mask in public says"""
56,21,> What's the best thing about a mask is the fact that it is not contagious. The fact that Maroon is wearing his mask does not mean that they are using it.
59,21,Why is putting on a mask not a good idea?
61,21,"I like this guy, he isn't the president that he thinks is the best candidate to represent. I want people to decide if they like twitchcon, but it's not."
70,21,"So, unless he's still going to resign and you're still wearing your mask - you can only ask what the new rules look like in the future - you might be able to use it when coaching a sport you like - for the entire team - and they don't need the new rule?"
91,21,"They are all very scary. I haven't had a nose, but the sneeze was pretty bad. The government has absolutely zero incentive to stop the spread of viruses, so I can't imagine a problem."
96,21,Is it an actual law?
99,21,"I ain't just being narcissistic. It's a serious illness that needs a doctor to treat it. People need to be well informed about what's going on, especially on their own, and that's why it's the first thing that comes to mind."
22,21,It is very much the right answer.
38,21,oh man I think i should wear a mask.
41,21,"It's also not really a national issue. But there's also an issue with the fact that the government is trying to put people at risk by cutting a job. This might work in my state, too, and I think they should be working on a law preventing people from getting sick - but you're right it's not just the federal government."
52,21,"I don't understand why some people believe that, and some people don't even have the motivation to put on a mask. The problem with this is that the government has actually done a lot to help stop the spread of a virus."
54,21,"The problem with wearing a mask isn't the fact that the government is in fact trying to stop the spread of the virus, it's the fact that it's just a temporary mask, and you can't actually wear it anymore because of that."
56,21,"Exactly what I thought. It's actually a pretty smart way to have a ""free pass"" to get people to wear masks while driving, and a way to help spread a virus. Obviously, it's a joke and I'd love to see a movie about a virus that was never actually in the public eye."
59,21,A man with a mask is an unemployed citizen.
61,21,>Isn't that the one movie I watched with Obama? The problem is that the federal government doesn't have the ability to have an official that isn't involved with the problem.
70,21,>I love coaching however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops i love coaching.
91,21,Is he still trying to get an AMA?
96,21,You've never been to a game where a helmet wasn't required.
99,21,This is one of the top three things to post in the last few months.
22,21,You are just making a joke. And I don't care if you're not in a relationship with me.
38,21,I just realized that I am not a good athlete. I have never thought of wearing a mask as a way to help prevent the spread of a virus.
41,21,It seems that the government is not actually acting like it's being a real cause for concern. That's why a mask is banned and its a part of the problem.
52,21,"So, they're going to stop the spread of a virus?"
54,21,I feel like a guy who grew up in the 1960s is just an incompetent dick.
56,21,"he is making it a joke, not a joke. i mean that he is not the one joking about the government trying to stop a spread of a virus."
59,21,"He is being a bit of a narcissist, and apparently he is talking about his personal health, which is something that is so common in people who would be in the position to 'put on a mask.'"
61,21,"I'm very sorry OP, but the US government's decision to ignore the CDC's warning about the issue is extremely controversial."
70,21,"I think that the idea of a ""pavement"" of Trump's mask is really incompatible with a good coach."
91,21,"The government doesn't have the ability to have an official that isn't involved with the problem. I think the person who's got to ask you is a dick. That would be a really, really fucked up argument. There is no way you can fire someone for ignoring the fact that they are violating the Constitution or making them responsible for their actions."
96,21,"As an athlete, I have to point out that while we can't help stopping the spread of a virus by just wearing a mask, we can definitely help the government protect against it. I can't stand the idea of a game with the helmet on."
99,21,"So, if you like these comments, tell them to stop making the comments."
22,21,"I don't know if you should be getting a visa, but it's a big step to get an infection."
38,21,I think the reason for the mask's a bad idea is because they can't stop it. It's not a way for a politician to do it.
41,21,"I've got an argument for you. You should know that while you're not necessarily right, you need to take it from the government, and you don't necessarily have to be involved in the government's efforts to stop a virus from spreading, and not just the government."
52,21,"No, it's not."
54,21,It seems like this is some kind of conspiracy to make the government look stupid and not have the proper authority to change it.
56,21,This is what I think I need to learn.
59,21,"“The government must take a safety precaution by removing the masks. The masks are not necessary for a person to have a virus. I feel like the only good thing about them is that they make people uncomfortable in their room, so it becomes like the ol''fucking shit....and I’ve always thought this is something that’s a fucking joke."
61,21,"CANNOTANSWER OP Are you aware that the government is invading an entire nation? It's the very definition of a medical issue, not a health issue."
70,21,"Whenever I see a white guy wearing a mask, I wonder if the white guy is really not racist?"
91,21,My favorite comment from this subreddit is: A fda official might just be a skunk guy. I think he means that wearing a mask is no longer the most effective protection against a virus. It's a very common form of respiratory infection. The EPA and NRA have no authority to do what they want. It seems like this is some kind of conspiracy to make the government look stupid and not have the proper authority to change it.
96,21,"[Also, the CDC is incredibly ill for not wearing a mask. It is not the best thing to happen when you become a professional.](http://www.twitchcon.com/news/nfl/news/nfl_context_file_name/news_report/nfl_context_report.htm)"
99,21,"You know the joke. You can't just say ""oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that"""
22,21,"CANNOTANSWER: ""Is it OK to say something about people who wear masks when they don't want to."""
38,21,"They've just come to the conclusion that people are just being stupid, and the government needs to do something about it. I wouldn't trust anyone if the president was wearing a mask. It's not even a bad idea, it's just silly."
41,21,Basically the EPA is trying to stop the spread of a virus. It's actually a very common form of respiratory infection. The EPA does have the right to control it by preventing the spread of it. That's the point.
52,21,What if it were us? Who did you believe that was a lie?
54,21,"It's a good way to get people to show The movie ""The U.S. Government"" (http://www.noaaac.gov/wiki/RapCrypt.jpg): ""I'm a fan of the ""Wearing a mask in my car alone"" comment."
56,21,I'm going to go down to the CDC and the CDC's safety department and get you a list of all the things the government has to do to stop spread a virus.
59,21,">Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.It's very simple, he is using the phrase ""fuck I don't want to feel this way"" too much. I think he was using the phrase ""fuck I don't want to feel this way"" too much."
61,21,"You're right, and I think that's not true, but a bunch of other things that's happening in that issue. I don't think the issue would ever be addressed with the CDC. But the problem with them isn't that they aren't the government, it's that the government is influencing it. It's a problem, not a problem at all."
70,21,"It's because we all want to play a sport and if a person can't wear it properly, they will be sick and they can't be happy."
91,21,"This article seems to be a bit out of line and a little too short. I'm sorry, but the link doesn't make it any clearer."
96,21,I'm pretty sure the NFL is in the minority of states that require an infield helmet. They are just as inflexible about them as the rest of the country in terms of the law they implement.
99,21,"Vaccination is a medical necessity, it entails getting vaccinated. There's an article from 2006 that says it's not a joke, but a joke."
22,21,"I'm sure the CDC is a major factor in the spread of viruses. Vaccines are not just about preventable diseases, but prevention and prevention of infectious diseases."
38,21,That isn't a good idea. It's a good idea.
41,21,"[Although that was my first time, the government did the work for him]. They could not do anything about it without getting sued for damages."
52,21,"How are you being stupid? What's the point of the article? It's interesting, but it doesn't seem to bring up much more than just a joke."
54,21,"I don't think it's a good thing to wear a mask outside, because you can't get sick without it."
56,21,> So the government was telling the people to go to work and buy the masks?
59,21,A woman's right to be in the position to see the president without a mask is the same as an invitation to a party fundraiser or political event.
61,21,"Yes, there's plenty of ways for the federal government to control public policy."
70,21,"I’d like to know when the last time I read this, it’s like the worst part of the whole thing."
91,21,Then there's not even one r/Fred comment.
96,21,"I don't know the CDC, but I'd be interested in learning more about the health issues that have occurred since they were created and the way the NFL has treated the problem."
99,21,I'm actually a little surprised by the amount of comments that are being made by people that don't follow the definition of a joke.
22,21,"It's a joke about how the government is a huge role model, but it is not something that the government does. It is not about the CDC and it is about the federal government, which in the eyes of all Americans is responsible for creating and implementing health programs. I think it's a bit unsettling that you think the government doesn't want to have one."
38,21,So what's the point of a mask? Is there something that's about the government not taking care of the sick?
41,21,I know. If I am in this situation I would be pretty upset. I wouldn't want to have to put up with that.
52,21,>The CDC should be able to tell people what to do with this skunk joke.
54,21,"A person's disability is the reason he or she was diagnosed. I mean, how do people know he was actually a member of the government? And what's the craziness of his parents? He has never been able to make it clear to a doctor he does not have the right to have a physical disability?"

I'm a vaccinated person with boosters, so I need to be able to afford one. I don't like my school anymore because of the masks."

96,21,"Vaccination is the primary measure of preventive care, not the retribution of the public."
99,21,"I think the point of the article is that the government should keep it on the side of people, and tell people that they can't be slapped in the face with the worst things in the world because of vaccination.

41,21,It is one of those things that people get sick by putting a mask on. They don't even know why people wear it.
52,21,"I don't see the point of the article. The point isn't the government, it's the people who know of the facts."
54,21,Its not just the federal government that is stomping on the issue of public health.
56,21,He's saying that the government is trying to cut people out of the healthcare industry. He's not joking about the government trying to do anything to stop a virus.
59,21,"Assuming the CDC is correct, it's not just a joke, but the kind of joke you're describing in the title."
61,21,I'm not sure I can explain this correctly but I do believe a lot of the people in this thread are aware of the CDC.
70,21,I really like that the comments have a little bit of humor in them. I love hearing how the coaches say it. I also have a lot of sense of humor that's very useful.

52,21,A lot of people think that the ACA isn't a joke because the US government isn't able to help stop a virus.
