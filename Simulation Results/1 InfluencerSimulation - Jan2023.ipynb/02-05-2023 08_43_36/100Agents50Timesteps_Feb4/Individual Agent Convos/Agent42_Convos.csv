87,42,The OP and other people here are so upset :)
89,42,It s a viral virus that has spread to a lot of people in the US (and its related to a lot of states) and they are the first to stop it. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
97,42,"Ooh man i like na the best, i want to see the sleaze on it!"
98,42,"He won't wear his mask to stay alive. That's his secret job. If he hasn't taken it off, it will be in his pocket and on his desk."
48,42,The problem here is that they are going to get in trouble for having a mask and not making a decision. And I think they are going to have to take some serious action to get that out of the way.
50,42,They actually voted for the helmet to be allowed under the health care system and not the public health. I've heard that wearing a mask to protect your face against viruses does have benefits.

75,42,The mask is designed to prevent viral infections. And it's also part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of the virus.

82,42,Wearing a mask outside is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
87,42,I'm a bit worried that this will get buried unless someone else is taking the test for it. I am sure the state is doing a good job at this as well.
89,42,"I'd rather have a face mask compared to the rest of my friends and family, instead of having to wear my own face mask."

50,42,It seems like people are assuming the federal government actually voted to allow this to happen because it is a very legitimate measure.
70,42,I like it because you said that you dislike a guy that wears a mask...
75,42,The people who don't wear masks can't be fired because of this.
