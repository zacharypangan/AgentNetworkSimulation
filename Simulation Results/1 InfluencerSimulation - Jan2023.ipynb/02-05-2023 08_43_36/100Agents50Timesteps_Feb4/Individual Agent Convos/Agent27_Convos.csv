27,4,It seems that santa is wearing a mask to protect himself.
27,12,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
27,20,"I’m a fan of vaccinating kids, I can say I grew up with a big brother who does not wear a mask at all."
27,23,What is a 'common sense'?
27,25,It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
30,27,I woke up this morning to find a mask that said 'can't be racist and don't support d nald tr mp'.
31,27,"A little bit of caution, but I wore my mask today. I was only about to leave an office in my face. It made my eyes look better in the mirror."
32,27,"This a few weeks ago i was with an old guy who was going to visit him for his birthday and she said he wasn't going to go back to school for him. he was a bloke, and the old guy was going to visit him and say he had a mask but his friends said he couldn't get away from the welder. he was in the bathroom crying about the fact that his neighbor didn't like the bloke or his mask and he just made out with him. he told me that the rest of the story was his"
44,27,Hey :D you need to learn to wear a mask to protect yourself! You should always do that!
45,27,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. Mask protect other people he only cares about himself mask protect other people he only cares about himself
53,27,"They're basically a law that states it can be revoked, so the government can't do it unless they know."
55,27,"The best part is, we cant use it to protect ourselves."
60,27,You dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that
66,27,That's an excellent point about the masks in the fucking govt.

91,27,I don't think you can get an AMA or a TAX in public. Just go back in time and read the titties and the rest of the comments.
27,4,The government can't do it unless they know.
27,12,I would say I can be proud of that as well.
27,20,What's the point of having a 'common sense'? It is one of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
27,23,I'm pretty sure the whole premise is that the government is using a bunch of things to prevent the spread of a virus. I'm sure the most recent AMA (or TAX) I read in the comments is fucking cliche and untrue.
27,25,As an old man who wears a mask every day I can imagine that if the other person was a victim of a mental health disorder he would be a terrible victim. I think it is a good idea to use a mask for protection.
30,27,... because you haven't vaccinated your child yet.
31,27,"OP is not a good person and I'd like to apologize. I'm a guy in a mask, and I would like to say I am not in a mask. You are wearing a mask, and I would like to apologize for not wearing one."
32,27,"There is a government mandate preventing the spread of any form of illness, and wearing a mask is a way to stop it."
44,27,"Oh yes, a little sourness there, btw."
45,27,I'm actually a coach and I wear a mask at every single event. I want to wear the mask to protect the players from a virus or an infection but not to prevent it from spreading. But I'm trying to explain what the role of masks are in protecting the players because I think it is a good idea to get it in public and help prevent a virus or disease.
53,27,"They're basically a law that states it can be revoked, so the government can't do it unless they know."
55,27,And they eat the whole thing and say it's disgusting.
60,27,"So the other day, when a guy went to a state convention, he went to a TWitchCon, where he was asked what a mask was and what he was going to wear. I was like..."
66,27,"I mean, you can be the guy who wears a mask on a hot day to do something, but you can never be a prick for doing it. Hopefully a man of that profession will make a difference. But yeah, this is the stuff we need, and if you can be the one in charge of it, you don't need a mask to take a hot day off."
73,27,"I'm afraid you're missing the point. If it's a question of how people think, I think he needs to answer it. ""Yes, I am wearing a mask, and I am a bit afraid of you being a man, so I'm going to have to wear a mask."""
75,27,"i don't know, I am not a doctor but i have an old mask so my best guess is the most likely it is a virus he might have."
76,27,Why are you wearing a mask outside or in your car alone? Why would you want to wear a mask that says it means he is trying to avoid it?
81,27,You said a guy with a mask and a sword he carries in his body and wears it for the first time every time he does something like this. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

91,27,... unless I read the titties.
27,4,i'm really sorry. you are too young to realize that a man can wear a mask every day and still get sick. and that's an excuse to wear it.
27,12,The OP is a liar. He's being so cliche.
27,20,[TWitchCon](https://twitter.com/media/media/sci/news/2010/02/agma/twitter-devil-phd-as-a-puppet-r/en/)
27,23,"""I can't be proud of that as well. What's the point of having a 'common sense'? It is one of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
27,25,"I've been on the opposite side of this for 6 years, and I never wore a mask outside of the party, only a couple of times a week. There's no sense to being a mask at all. I wear a mask every single day and I have never had an accident or illness. I don't like it at all."
30,27,"This is a good point, but I think it is a good idea to stop and be aware of this kind of thing. I am not sure whether that is a good thing or bad thing. You don't mention this thing, but you do mention that people who are racist and don't support him will be fired for this. Apparently that is one reason that people are so stupid about not vaccinating their children. The point is, the CDC doesn't have enough evidence to discredit this."
31,27,It's not a rule. Apparently a mask is worn in most public places.
32,27,What is this stuff like? Because they're wearing masks to stop the spread of a virus?
44,27,"Then if I was a president, I'd wear a mask."
45,27,"You seem like a pretty intelligent person, and I would be very, very surprised if there is a law that only allows guns to be smuggled through the mouth into a helmet and allowed to leave your face uninfected to help stop this problem."
53,27,"It is so much easier to have a face mask and the way you eat a piece of meat, and you're going to have to wear a mask."
55,27,A few words: “Ah... what’s this? A lot of people don’t realize it’s actually the government. “ Wearing a mask doesn’t mean you can’t protect yourself.
60,27,"Wearing a mask in a party is really weird. When you wear a mask at the party, your hair looks different, because you're sick, and you're not infected."
66,27,It's called a 'comedian mask' because you don't want to be a bad person. That's why a lot of the anti-virus groups want to shut it down.
73,27,"The issue isn't the masks. The issue is that you need to tell the government to ""wear them."" I don't think this is an issue at all."
75,27,It is also part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
76,27,This was the first time I've ever heard about wearing a mask outside/in your car with a shirt. I'm a very religious person.
81,27,"As far as I know there is no evidence of anyone wearing a mask in public. It is just an idea, with no proof, of any actual effectiveness of any government tool. You could say that, if you actually think about it, you're describing the effectiveness of an idea."
82,27,YMMV. It's been a few days since I've been wearing the mask outside in my car. So I'm looking forward to getting my teeth cleaned out. It would be hard to work it out.
91,27,The article said he didn't want to get an AMA or TAX in public. But that's not what the article says. I liked to think that wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
27,4,You can never wear a mask at a party with a shirt and then a hat.
27,12,>Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.i'm really sorry. you are too young to realize that a man can wear a mask every day and still get sick. and that's an excuse to wear it. The OP is a liar. He's being so cliche.
27,20,What a jerk. I'm not joking. It's more like this : a fucking troll who thinks you have a legitimate idea of the government.
27,23,"You may not like a mask, but it's part of how you're not gonna be able to get off the couch because it's a habit and you've been wearing it every day in an attempt to stop the spread of a virus. The only way it can happen is if it's worn by your family and is worn in public places."
27,25,"... and a few words: “Ah... what’s this? A lot of people don’t realize it’s actually the government. “ Wearing a mask is just an idea, with no proof, of any actual effectiveness of any government tool. I don’t think this is an issue at all."
30,27,This is the first one I've heard of:
31,27,> I was at a party where a guy was wearing a mask and it made him go insane. I've been on the team to prevent a virus that I've seen on people all day long and I don't even get it.
32,27,"The issue is that the EPA is sued for allowing people without the mask to wear a mask, and the state putting up with it."
44,27,So that is a joke that you're not supposed to answer.
45,27,I am just wondering if there is a way for the federal government to use a mask to protect people in the event of a virus being spread.
53,27,">I don't know what to say about the mask issue, but if I want to go to the police with their questions, I'm going to be totally honest with you about the mask issue."
55,27,"i'm not anti government/police, I don't think i have a better answer for you."
60,27,"I would never want to go to a party if I had to go, not wear a mask at all. If I was on the team it would help prevent the spread of a virus. The CDC and my friend ARE causing a lot of problems."
66,27,"A lot of the anti-virus groups are resentful, like the US, for allowing people to wear masks, but not to fight off the virus - which is a serious issue that needs to be discussed."
73,27,"No, it is a joke. He is attempting to tyrant."
75,27,"Well, in a way, you should have a bit more time for this."
76,27,"People are crazy about the government. They don't want to do anything wrong, but they have a right to go where they want."
81,27,"> The only way we can stop the spread of a virus is to put a shield on all the people that want to try to prevent it. Wearing a mask in public. It is just an idea, with no proof, of any actual effectiveness of any government tool. You could say that, if you actually think about it, you're describing the effectiveness of an idea."
82,27,"I think it was a lot more than just the ''I don't wear a mask outside in my car, so that I can't get my teeth cleaned out'', but it's what I think they want to do to protect us from viruses."
91,27,There is no way for the government to allow a more uniform on their body. But that's probably why it's a big issue. That's why it's a big problem.
27,4,Is this the same for other things?
27,12,"""Well, in a way, you should have a bit more time for this. People are crazy about the government. They don't want to do anything wrong, but they have a right to go where they want."
27,20,There's a lot of people who aren't interested in a mask.
27,23,"The EPA is sued for allowing people without the mask to wear a mask, and the state putting up with it. So that is a joke that you're not supposed to answer."
27,25,">There's no sense to being a mask at all. I wear a mask every single day and I have never had an accident or illness. I don't like it at all.

I've been on the team to prevent a virus that I've seen on people all day long and I don't even get it. The issue is that the EPA is sued for allowing people without the mask,"
30,27,"Vaccination doesn't stop the spread of a virus, it just stops it spreading. Vaccination is a major and costly disease. It's like he has to choose a food that doesn't show signs of being infected."
31,27,I had a man with a mask on in a party. She wore it all day. He was totally freaked out and was screaming a lot.
32,27,There is nothing allowing people without a mask to wear a mask.
44,27,No it's a joke and isn't funny at all.
45,27,I'm sorry to be such a fucking shit man.
53,27,The police are supposed to know about the mask issue. Is this what the government should do?
55,27,he didn't just say you are a fucking idiot
60,27,It's a joke. That's the one that makes me want to have the joke.
66,27,"I'm a doctor. I've always wanted to be in a medical field but I've never been to a game where I've actually been wearing a mask, and I've never been in a hospital because I felt like I was going to be obliterated by a virus. I've been in hospitals because I'm on a cpa. I don't think I could find a job where a man couldn't go. But if I did, I'd never again, and it's not going to change"
73,27,"""You need to tell the government to ""wear them."" I don't think this is an issue at all.'', 'No, it is a joke. He is attempting to tyrant."""
75,27,"Well, I'll take a hat off, and it's an emergency!"
76,27,Yes. They have a right to go where they want.
81,27,"People seem to think the same thing. In fact, I think the phrase is oversimplified."
82,27,"I don't think it's that easy. If you have a car with a mask that has a roof, and you take it off at night, it's an unsafe place to have it with a car roof. It's not a problem for a person with a helmet, but a common problem when the person is not in a car. In the US, it isn't a crime to have a mask in the car."
91,27,"I didn't know the EPA was a agency. You are not saying it's a problem, it's just a bad idea."
27,4,"That is a very very simple and simple question to ask the same question to people you are in contact with. The only reason we have this is that people have different reactions to things, whether they're tainted by an EPA employee or a government agency."
27,12,"A hat in the car is illegal in many states because it is used in public areas, with the person in the car not wearing a mask in the car being covered in a protective layer, not the place it was made in."
27,20,Vaccination does help prevent some of the spread of a virus. They just don't want to go where they want. It's not a serious issue at all.
27,23,A big part of 'infected' people who are really not going to get vaccines is because they are infected by the virus and have been at a lot of events with the mask on.
27,25,>It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
30,27,"There are some very serious issues, but the issue is that these people are using their masks to help prevent more people from getting a virus. You are probably going to hear something like this on the radio."
31,27,"This is not a ""joke"" or ""right"" comment."
32,27,A mask can stop the spread of viruses. It can also stop the spread of the virus itself.
44,27,I'm not the kind of guy that likes to talk about a joke.
45,27,"I think the first issue is if it's a prank, you have no responsibility."
53,27,"' I am not against Vacks mandates cuz they ruin the economy get people fired and people should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force', ""They're basically a law that states it can be revoked, so the government can't do it unless they know."", ""There are some good stories about people in Florida that don't wear masks. I've seen people on a TV show, and I just never wanted them to go to the police when they are actually there."
55,27,This is actually a good place to point out the government has a mandate to protect.
60,27,"Well, if you're looking for some kind of protection, you could wear a mask and see a doctor."
66,27,"If you're willing to put up with a lot of stupidity, I think you are the kind of guy who would rather pay a little more attention to health care than a doctor who would rather fight it off? I don't think you are naive, he just doesn't care enough to a point where you are willing to pay an unimaginable amount of attention to the fact that you have a medical background to do something you want to do, even if it's not necessary to do something you don't like. He is a good enough to try"
73,27,What is a tyrant in a mask? I don't care how sexist or sexist the president is because he thinks people will use it in the future and in terms of what's actually a sexist joke. It's just a joke.
75,27,"I agree with all the other comments about the government making the issue, as you have described, untrue, and is an understatement of the facts and culture of the state, so it seems to be a lot of misunderstanding."
76,27,This isn't an argument. This is an argument against it.
81,27,Vaccination is not required for everyone unless the person is in an advanced stage of a clinical trial. Isn't that why the state has mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters? Because it makes people less prone to contract and vaccinating.
82,27,They're the police. They're the people to punish. And they're the people to do this. It's their job to help the nutcase.
91,27,It sounds like the EPA and NRA have an issue to start with.

27,12,We have a hat in my car and that is really pretty cool and nice.

27,25,"> The only reason we have this is that people have different reactions to things, whether they're tainted by an EPA employee or a government agency."
30,27,"I am so glad you were able to understand this: The people who say ""I don't like the govt"" can't be racist, and the president tripped and died in the US."
31,27,"What a bad person. Considering the government is being involved with this and that people like you have a lot of issues with this, it doesn't seem like it would be very fair of them to put this on their face in public."
32,27,"It's not the EPA's job to stop the spread of viruses, and even if you wear a mask, you'll never stop being sick, or living."
44,27,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.Basically. They would think it would make people nervous when a virus gets raped by a government official. Why don't you wear a mask for your safety. This is a mask for people who are sick and sick - just like everyone else is. It's like you're describing a guy who is sick and sick - he has a mask and hasn't tried to change his mask."""
45,27,"You’re right - it’s a prank. It’s an anti-vaccine idea. It’s also a way of preventing a virus, which is illegal in most places. Vaccination in public is a bitch to implement, and I’m not sure why you think it’s a prank."
53,27,"[I read that a guy dressed as a twat was trying to help people in Georgia. That wasn't the point he was trying to make.](http://www.reddit.com/r/faddit/) Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
55,27,"""The only thing that has ever gotten in the way of a good joke is to not use them to stop this fucking virus from spreading, if not a mask you need a mask. You can't help anyone, even if they wear a mask because if they didn't want to do it, you shouldn't. """
60,27,"Wearing a mask at a party is weird. When you wear a mask, your hair looks different, because you're sick, and you're not infected."
66,27,He can't really wear a mask for a reason.
73,27,"So the guy who wrote this is a sexist and racist scumbag who thinks it's racist and racist? He's trying to shit a guy out of his dick he's trying to tyrant, and he's using a mask to make himself look like a scumbag who is tyrant."
75,27,Is it possible that people are trying to reclaim the issue that is just to prevent or treat a virus on themselves? They are just as sexist as Donald J. Trump was. Why do you think this would be a good idea?
76,27,Wearing a mask in your car alone doesn't help your health.
81,27,It's just as funny that he was wearing a mask for a long time to tell everyone he was having a good time and is actually an idiot to do it.
82,27,I think it's more like saying that EPA should make a change for the sake of the skunks.
91,27,The article goes on to state that the EPA and NRA have no authority to change the health care system.... But that's probably why it's a big problem. It's just a bad idea.
27,4,'Phoenix'.
27,12,"I’m just trying to be positive, but I think we could just suck it up and say we’ve got a bunch of things to get out of our way here. Whether or not you do something is irrelevant."
27,20,I think the article goes on to state that the EPA and NRA have no authority to change the health care system.... But that's probably why it's a big problem.
27,23,"It's called an ""idea"": it is the same thing as having a mask in the car. It's used to protect you from the public, but for the purpose of helping your community, it's illegal to put it on your face and in public places."
27,25,"I've heard people saying, ""Feeling a mask on is a good idea."" This isn't just another prank - it's an anti-vaccine idea. It's the idea that a man who wears a mask does not want to have a mask in public. This isn't even an anti-vaccine idea."
30,27,The jokes I heard from my mother about the vaccination of children on this website are hilarious. I didn't even see it coming until a couple weeks ago. She was pretty funny.
31,27,"This is not a joke, it's an insult to the people who are asking for a good reason, and it's a joke to some people. This is a good thing, but not a joke."
32,27,The Obama campaign is not a joke.
44,27,"The government is not actually in power to stop this issue, and to prevent it. It is merely allowing the president to use this as a tool to protect people. This is why it is illegal to use the masks, so it becomes a joke if it comes up."

66,27,"I was a doctor. I went to a game where I was wearing a mask and when I got home I felt really bad for the whole thing. I haven't been to a game where I was wearing a mask for years. Then I left because of the NSA, but I didn't have a reason for wearing a mask. And the next year I was fired for being a cpa and going to a party with no responsibilities. I got to do the math and now I have to resign for no reason."
73,27,There is also a joke in this sub about a guy wearing a mask in order to keep the government from being able to prevent anyone from wearing a mask.
75,27,"Putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when I get to my table is one of the dumbest things things things things things I have done in my entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask',"
76,27,Vaccination isn't a medical necessity. It's a necessity. The government has a right to enforce the government's actions. EPA has a right to make it mandatory.
81,27,Are you aware that the US government is invading?
82,27,"It seems like we should do this. What are the benefits of wearing a mask outside or in a car? Besides the fact that it’s not dangerous, it doesn’t make the government a bad place to get a skunk in a car."
91,27,"The author of this film hasn't made any claim that he has a right to know about or support the government, but that he believes that it would be more useful to have a skunk 'ghost' in his life. I can't see how it's possible he is aware that the government is trying to take action to sabotage it."
27,4,"It's a joke, but it's not something you like, like a joke. There is nothing else to laugh at and that's okay."
27,12,"I like the word joke. They're just implying that the government does not care about a person's health. I see it on the side of being an anti-vaccine movement, but this is something that's not really about health care. They're about protecting people."
27,20,"[Witting a mask in the car is illegal in many states because it is used in public areas, with the person in the car not wearing a mask in the car being covered in a protective layer, not the place it was made in. Vaccination does help prevent some of the spread of a virus."
27,23,"I don't even think this is a joke either, I really think this is a joke. And the idea of not wearing a mask is a joke. It is a joke and not a joke."
27,25,"I think it's funny how one person actually wants a government mask, but they don't want to be putting it on."
30,27,"I don't think anyone should feel stupid or silly. I do think it is a good idea to stop and be aware of this kind of thing. You don't mention it, but you do mention that people who are using their masks to help prevent more people from getting a virus. The CDC doesn't have enough evidence to discredit this."
31,27,If I were you I'd have more information to share about this. I can’t think of any of this.
32,27,The sexist stereotype. The sexist stereotype. The sexist stereotype.
44,27,"What's worse, when your friend has a mask on and the person is getting a virus, his mask is going to be more sensitive than everyone else's."
45,27,"I'm in the US and my husband and I wear masks all the time. I work at a university that only allows for the protection of medical patients at the moment, but that is because they get sick and want to have their mouths slammed through the mouth to keep them from spreading."
53,27,Apparently this was something that was a joke.
55,27,"Well. I mean, it's very hard to imagine a state like Florida where you're a federal citizen and a federal health care administrator."
60,27,"I think the whole point of a mask is to not wear it, it is to stop the spread of a virus. You are just an idiot and you shouldn't wear it if you don't like it."

76,27,Is the government acting against you? They're just invading.
81,27,"I want to say I've seen this before. I don't see the point of the 'Waring a mask in your car alone' comment. I think it's just a sign that the government is invading a country because it's in the name of protecting and protecting people, and therefore we need a mask to keep people from snooping or catching people's sick things.

27,12,"As a nurse, and part of the reason people can't wear a mask, I'd say they should wear a mask. It's a joke that people who wear a mask have been saying, ""The government is invading a country because it's in the name of protecting and protecting people, and therefore we need a mask to keep people from snooping or catching people's sick things."

45,27,I'm really confused. There's something going on between the two of us:
53,27,Why is it so easy to wear a face mask in your car? Because you don't have to wear a mask.
55,27,"The EPA and the CDC are very wrong, because they are using a language that makes no sense. They are talking about what skunks need to wear. This is a joke that's sexist."
60,27,"I am just gonna give a little context. If people wear a mask and are sick, that is a joke, as I'm sure there's some kind of social problem with it. The best joke of the week is if you don't think the government is doing anything about it. The government has done nothing about it."
66,27,RIP. I do not want to be a doctor.
73,27,"I feel like this is a joke. People have to figure out if the EPA is just another government that is being used to ""protect"" people."
75,27,"They are also in an EPA program that's funded by the US government, but they are not funding it yet. Unlike the EPA, they are still operating, and are trying to sabotage the EPA's mandate to keep people in the program."
76,27,"I'm going to tell you a quick truth, this isn't funny."
81,27,I don't see the problem with this because my father was a doctor and he was a medical student. The president had a lot of time to find his own answers in his own words.
82,27,"The US government is doing a lot of bad things to people in this situation, but it's just a jerk-jerk reaction to it. There is a bit of a difference between what it's a crime to wear a mask in a car and what it isn't a crime to do."

27,20,"There's a lot of the wrong people here. People who don't want to be a doctor just don't get the time to think about that. I don't see why the government hasn't changed health care. I haven't heard a single single joke comparing a sick patient to a skunk whose parents were actually vaxxers, even in the US, as that has nothing to do with the health care system."
27,23,"I mean, how are these people going to decide to wear the mask in public places?"

27,23,I’m a little surprised that all these people can say they’re still laughing at the EPA AMA.

32,27,"I don't understand what you mean. I'm not sure if you mean it's a joke. I mean it's a joke, and I haven't really even had a chance to read it. I have had a lot of experiences with people who did a lot of shit to be honest. And I don't like being told how it's going to happen for the gov't but I do think it's a really bad idea to have a friend in a government program that's helping us by making the gov'"
44,27,"They are incompetent, not necessarily racist. You guys are a good joke. I'd like to think that he's an asshole because of the idea that there's something that is just too big a deal to happen, which is probably one of the best ideas of all time."

53,27,I want to say this as a courtesy to AMA's in this context because it seems to be one of those things where we can't have an open discussion about anything but the issues of how masks are effective at stopping the spread of the virus.
55,27,CANNOTANSWER.
60,27,"People are getting sick so often they don't know what to wear, and they're asking the same questions all the time. I think it was some kind of joke from someone."
66,27,>I'm not against vacks mandates cuz they ruin the economy get people fired and people should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force
73,27,'Masks can suck'? Not a joke but a joke. He is trying to troll us.
75,27,I think the EPA was misinterpreting what the article said.
76,27,This is not a joke. It's a joke.
81,27,"CANNOTANSWER: I find it interesting that there's a joke in the title. In the context of the book, Trump doesn't have an official medical name and the people involved were in an ACA trial. We can't stop the spread of a virus."
82,27,What you're trying to say is the EPA and the IRS are the ones trying to get things done.
91,27,"AMA is not a valid answer. The article says ""The NRA has no authority to change the health care system"". "" The article is misleading, it's about the people not removing themselves from the system and putting them in charge of control."
27,4,"They can't, as it seems like they want to. The article states, ""Also, don't you think the EPA and NRA are doing it so that the people in charge don't have to worry about how the government is doing it?"""
27,12,"This has been on many different wiki pages and the articles are not really about the US government or how the government is used, they are about a way to make people look better. It's also a very common occurrence for people to be afraid of being a terrorist, because they feel the government is inhumane and will make them feel sick if they feel they're not safe. They were all there and this is what they believe in."
27,20,">But that's probably why it's a big problem."","
27,23,What did the EPA say when it had the opportunity?
27,25,''That's hilarious and funny and I'm not interested.

31,27,I'm not gonna call you racist.
32,27,"CANNOTANSWER: I am a republican, but I do not agree that a man who wears a mask is a politician. Trump has a long history of doing things that aren't sexist and racist."
44,27,It's a joke because it's an asshole. The article isn't funny at all because it's a joke about how the government treats people.
45,27,"The CDC, not a prank, was trying to make the government look stupid shit."
53,27,This article is not racist and is a joke.
55,27,I want to thank you for bringing up this topic.

76,27,I’m surprised the article is still written in an obscure language.
81,27,CANNOTANSWER: I'm pretty sad if I saw the entire list of jokes. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
82,27,"I don't understand why you're getting downvoted. Your comment has nothing to do with anything in this discussion, it's something that's a little less likely to get upvoted."
91,27,> The article goes on to state that the EPA and NRA have no authority to change the health care system... But that's probably why it's a big problem.
27,4,"There is nothing more to laugh at and that’s okay. I’m not a lawyer, but I can’t see what it’s about."
27,12,And a little bit of the last one: a liar.
27,20,“I don’t think it’s a joke because it’s a joke. It’s a joke. I don’t see why the government hasn’t changed the health care system.”
27,23,I think the EPA is doing some ridiculous things but this is in the end a joke. It's not a joke.
27,25,"“It’s the worst joke in the NFL, but that’s not the joke. I’m not interested."
30,27,Vaccination is one of the most dangerous drugs in the world.
31,27,"They aren't racist, because they're racist. They're not trying to prevent people from being sick because they're black. They're trying to prevent people from being sick because they don't want their sick children to be sick. It's the same way being sick of people wearing their own mask."
32,27,"It is a joke. And it's not the government. It's the people that are being incestated, and they don't care about you. They're not a good choice for politics and they don't want to change anything."
44,27,"He is a good guy. He is a great guy, and he is a great guy for what he does."
45,27,CANNOTANSWER: Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
53,27,"OP - if it's not a joke, I can't say it's a joke."
55,27,"There's a lot of misconception about the issue here, but I can give a better explanation of the point. The joke was probably made up by the federal government. So that's why I believe in it. I don't care what your sentiment is but I want to thank you for bringing up this topic."
60,27,"What does ""Making"" and ""Jake"" have to do with a virus?"
66,27,It's a big deal in the US. We can just have the CDC or an NRA or something.
73,27,"I'm a huge fan of the Bush Administration, and I agree with the majority of people here. It's not about the masks, it's about the masks. That's the point."
75,27,I think the first part of the story is funny and the third part is pretty clear.
76,27,"This is one of the most disgusting things to say. The CDC has a very hard time putting up with it. They have some very twisted policies against this, and it is a problem in many places."
81,27,I don't have the facts but I think the title is confusing at times. I think the 'I don't see the problem' part is misleading.
82,27,It's a bit of a rebuttal to the one on the government's part.
91,27,You can't force your brain to turn into a cat fuck.
27,4,">The only reason we have this is that people have different reactions to things, whether they're tainted by an EPA employee or a government agency."""
27,12,It was actually a joke.
27,20,Vaccination is an important issue for both a national and international level.
27,23,The point of the AMA is that it's an AMA and not a joke. That's exactly what it is.
27,25,"''It's a joke, but I don't like it at all. It's a joke. I can't even think of anything else to do with it. It's just a joke."
30,27,"I had a friend who had a joke that someone was going to tell me to ""get in the bathroom and turn myself in"". Then he gave me the full story, ""Then I came up with the first 'hunch' we were discussing the vaccine, which I didn't have to do, so I stayed up and told him how to tell the joke."""
31,27,"I think the article is right to say that the article is full of examples. The author was right to say, “It’s pretty ridiculous for the government to require a man to wear a mask to prevent the spread of a virus.”"
32,27,It’s a joke. But I don’t like being told how it’s going to happen for the gov't but I do think it’s a really bad idea.
44,27,"I like to imply that there is a problem with the government. The Obama administration is not a democratic party, or a right-wing party, and they are not in it to deal with such issues."
45,27,"A prank, not a prank. But a prank to make the president look stupid."
53,27,Are you kidding me? I'm not. And you're not racist.
55,27,The first one says they don't need to put a mask on in order to stop the spread. They are using it as a slur. The second one says that it is useless.
60,27,Why would people wear a mask and not be infected? What's the point of wearing a mask? I think it's a joke.
66,27,"I was reading an article from the New York Times about a man wearing a mask and that's what it's like to do some dirty things like ""the government is sabotaging their ability to keep a hive mind in your face if you are going to leave a medical facility.

73,27,>The mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.It is an easy and effective solution.
75,27,"The EPA and the American people are going to get in trouble for doing shady, racist, hypocritical things."

27,4,"I like this idea. I'm a big fan of the vaccination part, but I'm a little tired of the rest of the post."
27,12,And that was my idea of a joke.

27,25,"In the United States we have vaccines for a wide variety of diseases, from viral illnesses to AIDS. Vaccinations do not prevent any of them, but the government has been pushing for it since the first administration in the 50s. The issue is a little more complicated than the jokes in the article. The government needs to be able to tell us what the jokes are about."

31,27,"A bit of a cliché to sound racist. But no, the NRA is trying to re-shape the population, and that is why they don't want to help people with this. They want to keep their own people from doing their own thing for them. They want to keep their own people safe."
32,27,"This doesn’t sound like a joke to me, but if you're an EPA official you can really get it to work, and it might be an effective way to prevent the spread of viruses. And the EPA can do the same with a mask. That’s not going to work."
44,27,It’s just a joke. You’ve got to believe.
45,27,"Well, he seems like a dick to me, so I can see that he's got a joke about a prank, I'd be gonna say I'm just confused about why it's a prank."
53,27,"HA! Yeah, this is really a joke! This is how you end it all. You don't even need a mask to stop it, and you have no idea what you're doing here."
55,27,"... and the fact that we can't do it. You know, a joke."
60,27,I'm going to have to take a break. But the article is saying something about the lack of understanding and a joke about this. I am still sceptical and not sure what the AMA is.

75,27,What are you doing here? You sound like the guy who has been at the center of the sexism scandal. You don't need a mask to stop the spread of a virus to get to your table. You don't need a mask to do the thing. You don't have a mask to help stop the spread of the virus.
76,27,I'm not sure how you equate 'unwanted' with 'unwanted'. I can't say that there's a way that it's a joke in this sub. I guess you could put your mind to it as well.

73,27,I'm going to go back to a different sub for a bit to find out why this is a joke. I'm going to say it:
75,27,"It's a joke because you don't have to wear a mask to protect yourself, and you're a Republican. Those people need to be vaccinated to prevent them from getting the ACA."

44,27,"a nutjob is a joke because he is a joke, and because he has a problem with sex and not just about the government he doesn't know how to do it"
45,27,A little bit about the ACA:
53,27,Vaccination isn't an essential requirement to stop the spread of AIDS. People with HIV are sick of putting on masks. People who wear a mask to prevent the spread of AIDS.
55,27,It's a joke because the general public is not on board with the health care system.
60,27,Vaccination is a joke. It's a joke because it is a joke.
66,27,CANNOTANSWER:
73,27,"I'd put a new one on the 'The problem isn't the mask', because it's a joke. But the joke is still pretty funny."
75,27,I think you just went from the first two sentences to the second one.
76,27,">""Is it a legal necessity because the government has a right to enforce it?"", ""I'm sure there is some humour there to sway the public to adopt a mask in your car alone doesn't help your health."""
81,27,"the phrase ""war"" is used by Americans to discredit government. People seem to be putting the blame on the government for all the jokes."
82,27,I think that's a good idea to do in an environment that isn't a hygienic situation or the government's business.
91,27,"I'm gonna say I think you need to read the title because ""They are trying to tame the healthcare system. The EPA and NRA have no authority to change the health care system. The article goes on to state that the EPA and NRA have no authority to change the health care system. But that's probably why it's a big problem. It's just a bad idea."
27,4,"Vaccination is legal in most countries. It's illegal in most countries. The ACA has a bad record and a lot of people are ill. Well, at least it's not a joke."
27,12,"They are using it to protect people, as well as to keep their hands off of health care for themselves. If there's no laws against it, I think it's just a joke."
27,20,What’s it about the ObamaCare Act that is being used?
27,23,The AMA was the only one that popped into my head.
27,25,"I don't really want to be a politician, but hey. I am sure you are on a good day."
30,27,"In this context, the CDC has to comply with the law to make the vaccine law enforceable."
31,27,"Having been in an AMA a while ago about the NRA, I think the first couple of words are that it's not a joke."
32,27,I have never heard anything about that.
44,27,What do you mean by joke? Because the article is being made by the CDC. It is an article about how the government treats people.
45,27,"I just saw this and I am incredibly confused and uninterested. This isn't a prank but a joke. It's a joke that you might not understand, because the ACA is a joke."
53,27,"I am not a big fan of any of the things you are saying, but I know some people who are not racist. So I don't think there is any reason for it, if not for the fact that I have seen people with HIV be raped and put on a mask in public and the ACA doesn't make it a joke."
55,27,>The only thing that has ever gotten in the way of a good joke is to point out the government has a mandate to protect.
60,27,I don't think they are a joke because it's a joke and they are the ones making a joke about it. It's a joke because of what they are doing.
66,27,"No, I'm not saying I am against them, but I think they are a legitimately sexist thing to do."
73,27,It is a joke. I'm not a troll. I don't think it's a joke.
75,27,"Vaccination is a joke, because it's the government's job to stop the spread of a virus. Vaccination is a joke. Unless the EPA mandates something else, the EPA should just not do it."
76,27,"I like to think the phrase ""Petty"" is an overused term."
81,27,"So when the ACA pilot pilot program is announced, it starts?"
82,27,"If we are talking about the government's own policy and it's not a federal problem, I'm gonna take a look at the wikipedia article, ""[I believe] wearing a mask outside and in my car alone is a crime."""
91,27,I'm really glad to hear that the title was written by a guy who was in a very difficult situation. He has absolutely no problem with the government in general. He needs to make a statement.
27,4,"Yes, it's a joke."
27,12,"It is a joke because it is about the government. The issue is how the CDC uses the word ""jake"" and the government uses it to do good things."
27,20,"The fact that it's illegal is not an answer to the question you're asking. The question should be to find a CDC/NRA article where the ""hat"" is part of the government's mandate to prevent the spread of a virus."
27,23,The idea that they want to make this joke is just dumb. They are using it to keep people from getting sick.
27,25,>What's it about the ACA that is being used? The AMA was the only one that popped into my head.
30,27,"A fucking doctor who is a troll threw a big shit to your CDC. A few days ago, the president told his daughter it was ""the fucking worst thing you can do in a day!"", a long time ago, the CDC said he was ""very impressed with the people who were so concerned about him, but he did not respond with ""Okay, he sucked a fucking virus in our country."""
31,27,I was at a party where a guy was wearing a mask and he was screaming at a group of kids. He was screaming at a group of kids. He was totally freaked out and was screaming a lot.
32,27,"A joke is a joke, not a joke. A joke is a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke. A joke is a joke because it's a joke."
44,27,"'A guy with a virus on, but not a white male, has a mask to protect himself from all his friends with a virus.'"

53,27,CANNOTANSWER FACT: The government is trying to rename it the 'Football Amendment'.
55,27,"I don't think you have any more of a problem with the joke than this one. It's a joke. It's a joke, and it is a joke."
60,27,"It's a joke, yes, but it's not a joke."
66,27,This is what is supposed to be a joke.
73,27,I don't think you are a troll because it's a joke.
75,27,The article is a joke.
76,27,What is the main topic? You're just a fan of the whole thing.
81,27,"CANNOTANSWER: I think there is a joke in the title. In the context of the book, Trump doesn't have an official medical name and the people involved were in an ACA trial. We can't stop the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
82,27,"In my opinion, it is only a minor problem if you wear a helmet to help get the skunks out. I would not be able to tell a fucking difference between a ""respective of privacy"" or ""what if a skunk is in the car."" I'd be more willing to be in my car than not being able to drive if I were you."
91,27,It's a story not a joke.
27,4,"Vaccination is legal in most countries. It's illegal in most countries. The ACA has a bad record and a lot of people are ill. Well, at least it's not a joke."
27,12,...and that’s an excuse to wear a mask. The OP is a liar.
27,20,A joke is a joke because it is a joke.
27,23,"What exactly is a joke, the one I read?"
27,25,The problem is the government is trying to make it a joke that is absurd.
30,27,The AMA is not the only joke. It’s not the only joke. The AMA is the only one.

32,27,He said he had an accident with the mask to prevent the spread of the virus and that he wouldn't want to go back to school for him. He was referring to the fact that his friend was a patriot because he had a welder. He said he was in a rush to stop it.
44,27,The whole joke is about how the government treats people.
45,27,"The joke itself seems to be that if you don't think the ACA is a prank, then the President should."
53,27,"... which means that it is the most incomprehensible thing on the planet and has a logical answer: I don't think the president is doing the ACA, just that it is a joke."
55,27,What is the joke about? Did the article say that the government doesn't need a mask? Did they do anything wrong? Did they have a right to prevent people from getting sick? Did they take away all of the benefits the CDC gave the public? What the actual joke is?
60,27,In the AMA that they are talking about the mask as a joke?
66,27,This is the type of joke that I can't think of that is actually a legitimate joke.
73,27,"oh you dont mind wearing your mask. You dont care if you wear a mask, I don't care if you are going to get tripped and have to have to wear a mask, if you're not a doctor, do you want to be able to speak to a doctor about a prank about the mask? The only way to prevent the spread of a virus is to have it on your face and on your head. I don't care what you are thinking about."
75,27,Vaccination isn't a joke. It's a joke because it's the government's job to stop the spread of a virus. Vaccination is a joke. It's a joke.
76,27,"I'm just gonna say that you're a huge supporter of the right to the vaccination, but I think the joke is a joke and is based on a lot of what I'm not familiar with, not just any ad hominem type thing. Essentially, your AMA is about how the government can't protect people from the spread of a disease. The people who are concerned about the government aren't the ones complaining about it."
81,27,"CANNOTANSWER: I think it's interesting that there's a joke in the title. In the context of the book, Trump doesn't have an official medical name and the people involved were in an ACA trial."
82,27,"''They are not just some bad thing, they are the people doing it."
91,27,A lot of people seem to think the NRA is a threat to society. And the fact that it’s an ad that has absolutely no merit. Does this have merit in any way?
27,4,Isn't a mask a joke? Vaccination isn't a joke. Vaccination is a joke.
27,12,It's not a joke.
27,20,It’s a joke because it doesn’t have a proper purpose. It’s a joke because it’s a joke. It’s a joke because it’s a joke. It’s a joke because it’s a joke.
27,23,It is a joke. It’s a joke. The joke is a joke. It’s a joke. It’s a joke. It’s a joke.
27,25,"OP's response to that is that it's just a joke. ""It's a joke because it's the government's job to stop the spread of a virus. Vaccination isn't a joke."""
30,27,"What was the joke? I don't care if it was about the president, it's about the AMA."
31,27,I like 'i like you'.
32,27,"I mean, this is a pretty big shit and pretty twisted joke apologies, but in your context you are only saying this because you seem to think it's very funny, but I agree with it."
44,27,''Something about a joke'' is a joke.
45,27,No. There is no ACA. The US is going through a lot of tragedies and they are trying to force the government to act like a prankster.
53,27,I don't really know.
55,27,"""The government does not need a mask to stop the spread of a virus."
60,27,The article suggests that the issue is a joke. But I would just leave.
66,27,"''It's not a joke'', 'What is it about?''"
73,27,So it was a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke about the government and how people treat other people. This is the worst kind of nonsense I've seen in a while.
75,27,You want a movie...
76,27,[As a guy who works for the NRA and the AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbysmart):
81,27,So what does he think the phrase is?
82,27,"You can't just fuck a skunk while driving in the rain, a skunk isn't allowed to be in a car or the government isn't able to prevent them from getting into it."
91,27,So you read the first part and don't like the ad?
