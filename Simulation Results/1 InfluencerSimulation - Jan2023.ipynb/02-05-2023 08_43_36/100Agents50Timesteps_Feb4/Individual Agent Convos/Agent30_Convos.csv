39,30,don t go to a party with a house full of ppl not wasting mask during a pandemic
48,30,i was late but i gotta hand it to he s got me wearing my mask everywhere and my area is spiking hard right now just signed up to get me and the wife a drive up test come saturday
49,30,a special shout out goes to mr londono and ms latorre we loved the teachable moment of mask wearing and addressing covid questions also a very happy birthday to our vebbulldog jamya
53,30,i m not against vacks mandates cuz i don t think i ll catch the cough i already had it i m against them cuz they ruin the economy get people fired and people should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force
63,30,yes the newest strain is soooooo contagious just bc they have a mask on their hands pics don t mean they re using it
73,30,oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that
87,30,i m going to say this about twitchcon and masks you can hate me if the state town doesn t have an mandates you can t get mad that an event doesn t not sure if sd has any mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask
92,30,i m not against vacks mandates cuz i don t think i ll catch the cough i already had it i m against them cuz they ruin the economy get people fired and people should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force
97,30,oh man you should come to georgia it s like people here think wearing a mask gives them covid there s so few
30,24,This post is going to turn into a shitstorm. Get up and go take a run for your life and get over yourself
30,27,I woke up this morning to find a mask that said 'can't be racist and don't support d nald tr mp'.
37,30,Exactly what i was hoping for!
39,30,"I've been a nut and my son is a vaxxer. But his dad is not a superspreader. If he wants to stay in a car, he can't have his dad drive up to a funeral."
48,30,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.i was late but i gotta hand it to he s got me wearing my mask everywhere and my area is spiking hard right now just signed up to get me and the wife a drive up test come saturday
49,30,It’s a joke but i’m going to try and say it again and try to justify this and i’m going to just leave.
53,30,I would rather not be wearing a mask than a jab for a very long time.
63,30,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
73,30,"i like wearing my mask because my fiancee wants me to go ashore, and I've had to get a big break from work"
87,30,As far as I know there is not a state mandate. A Vaccinated person can t go anywhere that requires a mask. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
92,30,The mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
97,30,"So, as a woman, I don't have much to hide...I'm just going to leave for work tomorrow morning, but it's all gone and I have no way to get a place to hide."
30,24,"I have a mask on my face that says ""Cannot be racist and don't support d nald trump."" It's pretty cool."
30,27,... because you haven't vaccinated your child yet.
37,30,The fact that he doesn't wear a mask as part of his campaign is not a good thing. I like a lot of the people you list that are trying to argue about what is going on. He wants to bring it up and the people who are trying to do it and it's not working out.
39,30,>Wasn't the newest strain of the virus.yes the newest strain is soooooo contagious just bc they have a mask on their hands pics don't mean they're using it
48,30,"I live in Georgia, and I've always been one of those people."
49,30,CANNOTANSWER: a special shout out goes to mr londono and ms latorre we loved the teachable moment of mask wearing and addressing covid questions also a very happy birthday to our vebbulldog jamya how does the mask make his breath come out of the back of his head
53,30,"Yeah, that's a good one. And yeah, I think it s ridiculous, but I think that if we are to stop the spread of the virus, we need to be ready for the next phase."
63,30,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
73,30,I think that wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I'm not against Vacks mandates'either but they are awful.
87,30,"Vaccination is a huge and costly disease, and isn't the only reason a person is unable to get the vaccine in the first place."
92,30,"EPA is an outside agency, not a government. There isn't enough evidence to argue that a public nuisance, especially a hacked computer, is a threat. It's a security precaution. You can have someone get fired for it but that's not about you."
97,30,"He was putting on masks to hide from a virus. I'm going to say that's not very much to imply that he made the US like that, but I guess if you think he is using a mask you should think something along the lines of he is trying to help stop it, but he doesn't do it, he was just putting it on, not doing it."
30,24,It's like someone who has no idea how to talk about the government.
30,27,"This is a good point, but I think it is a good idea to stop and be aware of this kind of thing. I am not sure whether that is a good thing or bad thing. You don't mention this thing, but you do mention that people who are racist and don't support him will be fired for this. Apparently that is one reason that people are so stupid about not vaccinating their children. The point is, the CDC doesn't have enough evidence to discredit this."
37,30,"It's not about the federal government (though not just in the federal government) but the gov't that 'protects' people from their health care needs by requiring them to wear a mask. The idea is that there are two kinds of masks, one for the public and one for the private sector."
39,30,I don't think the current rule is to use a mask. You get a swivel as an indicator of a swivel. It's also called a mask and is also used by people who have been affected by a virus that is very contagious. The whole reason the virus is so sick is because it makes us all think that the person in charge of the virus is just going to get it and that the person that isn't at risk of it is simply not ready for it to develop.
48,30,I think the better thing to do is to get in the bathroom and turn yourself in.
49,30,"We're going to have to wait, and then do something else. Honestly if he can't change his mind and get it changed he's just gonna go to his new job. It's like that to you for the sake of this sub."
53,30,That's a good one.
63,30,"If the government is trying to protect someone who is a bit sick by getting rid of the virus, there will be a lot more people getting bitten by the virus."
73,30,You could wear a mask for a good reason.
87,30,"Vaccination is a huge and costly disease, and isn't the only reason a person is unable to get the vaccine in the first place."
92,30,It's probably time to re-educate your kids.
97,30,"i'm not sure that's what i meant. if he is using the word mask as a way to stop the spread of a virus, the way i think about it is that people who can hardly see the signs and can't see if the gov't is the one to stop the spread of a virus. They can't even see the signs. But, they will see the signs and can't imagine the time they spent in hiding a virus. That's the point where i was trying to help him."
30,24,"[I live in Georgia, and I've always been one of those people."
30,27,This is the first one I've heard of:
37,30,"Yes, the only reason a person can have a mask in a public hospital is to get them a mask. Not everyone can eat pizza. You can eat the same food you eat on any day of the week."
39,30,It's more about how good the government and people of other nations do compared to what people wear and why people choose to wear a mask.
48,30,[Original post](http://richnesses.org/news/2011/06/Full_text_Full_text) [History](http://richnesses.org/news/2011/06/Full_text)
49,30,That is all the talk and no explanation. I hate reversals. I hate reversals.
53,30,I would rather eat a piece of meat and not wear a mask than wear a mask.
63,30,"It's really silly and ridiculous, it's almost as if people have no idea what a virus is. I mean, it's probably just the fact that you're so sick of people wishing to live and that they're sick, but that's the only way they're going to be infected."
73,30,"It's a really easy and effective solution, to work through a number of shitstorms, and for good reason."
87,30,"I think this is why people wear a mask to get an infection. I'm not sure how to make sure you wear it, but there is still an option to ot not wear it."
92,30,"[NAME] Is a person who is being fired for saying 'No mask' to people who have to choose if they are against the mandates, but have to choose that they should be allowed to choose to wear a mask or get a jab instead of getting fired."
97,30,"This is why so many of our people are fucking hate him. This was just a joke on r/womenwhodidntknow. Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
30,24,It sounds like a good deal of the reversals are about the government.
30,27,"Vaccination doesn't stop the spread of a virus, it just stops it spreading. Vaccination is a major and costly disease. It's like he has to choose a food that doesn't show signs of being infected."
37,30,"Getting a virus is a good thing if you ask me, and if you're willing to look at it it's going to make a lot of sense. But if you're willing to look at it like the movie did, it doesn't seem too serious to me at all."
39,30,>I think the idea of a mask being worn as a protective mask is absurd. I would hate for my obama to come back in with me if he said he'd do it.
48,30,"I think the best thing to do is to get into the bathroom and turn yourself in. When the president tripped in the US they are not using a mask, they have to wear the mask. They're using a mask to avoid the spread of the virus. [[http://richnesses.org/news/2011/06/Full_text_Full_text](http://richnesses.org/news/2011/06/Full_text) A lot of the problems that plague these guys are"
49,30,">The government is not willing to admit that their behavior is wrong or a good thing. And what about the people who said ""I'm not gonna lie"" or something like that. It sounds like there is a problem in the political world, that people are not doing that in a public place."
53,30,"OP, this is a pretty uninformed way to say the word."
63,30,Is it possible that someone's not as sick of people wishing to live and that they're sick? Because that's a very valid point.
73,30,"My favorite part of the story is the fact that I don't think it's actually a good idea, but my friend told me the whole thing. She said that if I were wearing a mask I would have to pay for it. This man is going to be the worst person to ever happen to me. It's because of that that I don't want to work on the job, but he can't work on his mask."
87,30,It's not a federal policy.
92,30,"If a Republican is being fired for saying ""yes"", it means ""no"" because the government is not using the term ""fake"" and is using it to defend its own health and safety, but rather, because EPA doesn't have enough authority to defend its own health and safety."
97,30,You should be ashamed to be on the wrong side of the internet. This is one of the most annoying things on the Internet and I've never heard anything like it.
30,24,"I like it. It isn't really a joke. I think the issue here is reversals of the same stance. A reversal of the stance against vaccination is like saying I will not vaccinate your kids. I don't care if the reversals aren't a joke, but if you want to get over yourself, I'd do that. The reversals have been proven so far that the problem is just more complicated than that. This is why it doesn't really make you uncomfortable and makes you uncomfortable."
30,27,"There are some very serious issues, but the issue is that these people are using their masks to help prevent more people from getting a virus. You are probably going to hear something like this on the radio."
37,30,"I love this movie, but if it has a whole lot more to do with how we treat this virus, this is what it sounds like to me. This film is incredibly infuriating. There's a lot of misinformation on here, but you could be right that this is not the case, and that's not the case. You can't just ignore the fact that a person's health is being treated in a 'needy' way. This movie makes no sense. What the other one's saying is that people have a hard time because they"
39,30,It's a good idea to do some research on the government.
48,30,"I'm a teacher and a politician. I'm not crazy about government, but I am so angry about the govt in a way that my wife does not have a job."
49,30,It was the kind of thing I like to do when I am sick. I don't suck it up.
53,30,"You know, I don't really understand why people would want to wear a mask. I just feel like it would get you fired if the government could do a bit more."
63,30,I'd really like to have you know this.
73,30,>I think the idea of wearing a mask for the purpose of saving the economy really that simple.
87,30,... you don't understand why you think a mask would be a good idea.
92,30,I would like to hear the government's latest attack on people who wear a mask.
97,30,I like the joke. My favorite is the part where he says that he didn't wear a mask when he was in Georgia. And he then says that he was putting on masks to stop the spread of the virus. The other one is when he is in a mask to prevent a virus from spreading and he tells people to don't use them if they say something like that.
30,24,>Is it possible that someone's not as sick of people wishing to live and that they're sick?
30,27,"I am so glad you were able to understand this: The people who say ""I don't like the govt"" can't be racist, and the president tripped and died in the US."
37,30,The other two are basically the same thing.
39,30,Is a mask part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus?
48,30,I don't think it's the government's job to make a joke.
49,30,"The problem is, that people wearing a mask in the public are not safe and that the government is doing it because it is a big deal in the political world."
53,30,I think that the joke is that the government is trying to get rid of a mask and to stop it from spreading.
63,30,"[NAME] has a joke. (Mental infections like these aren't common) ""If you were sick from wearing a mask, you wouldn't be infected to keep yourself alive."""
73,30,As someone who has been in a similar situation in the past.
87,30,"It was a long story, it's an interesting one."
92,30,"I can't speak for anyone else on the internet - but I'm not gonna argue with people who think this is a terrible, stupid move - because there's no rational reason to believe that they should be fired, and you should feel stupid for that, since it's so easy to say."
97,30,"As someone who was born and raised in Georgia and live in a small town, I can honestly say I find the entire hive mind to be just a little annoying. The whole place is a mess, and you can't just tell people to stop it. This is what's happened here. It's only been around for a few months, but it's been very, very, very long."
30,24,It's not going to make you uncomfortable or at all insecure. If I were to put on a mask and I'd just wear my pants to protect my face from the virus I would be fucked
30,27,The jokes I heard from my mother about the vaccination of children on this website are hilarious. I didn't even see it coming until a couple weeks ago. She was pretty funny.
37,30,I've never heard this article before.
39,30,This post is so short and sarcastic. This is not really funny. I hope you have a good day.
48,30,The problem is that there isn't a clear clear message to be utterly and completely addressed by these people. It's not the government's job to make a joke. It's the public's. It's the government's job to make a joke.
49,30,I'm going to leave now because I have to start getting a job I can't get the money for.
53,30,Is this a joke or is this just a joke? I've been to a lot of places and I've never heard about it but it just seems like a joke to me.
63,30,"The CDC is trying to combat the spread of HIV/AIDS through people, not masks. It doesn't seem like it's going to stop it. It's going to help with some of the most difficult and insidious ways possible."
73,30,"The EPA is using the term ""fake"" as a security tool."
87,30,"You say, ""Well, no, I don't like wearing the mask in public. I think it's kind of offensive that they're saying this, but I don't think it's that stupid."""
92,30,"I've seen the whole thing and I'm very interested to hear some of the stories about people getting fired for saying ""no"" in a voice over or video e-mailing the person who needs to be called in."
97,30,I'm a fan of the president and the president's policies.
30,24,In this post you said it was a joke. It has a joke.
30,27,"I don't think anyone should feel stupid or silly. I do think it is a good idea to stop and be aware of this kind of thing. You don't mention it, but you do mention that people who are using their masks to help prevent more people from getting a virus. The CDC doesn't have enough evidence to discredit this."
37,30,My uncle got sick while playing baseball last year and he told me this is one of those cases he'd have to keep it up to do.
39,30,"""I've been a nut and my son is a vaxxer. But his dad is not a superspreader. If he wants to stay in a car, he can't have his dad drive up to a funeral."""
48,30,The idea that everyone wears masks is a joke is misplaced. It's a joke. The reason a person doesn't think it's a joke is because there's not enough money to go around trying to get more people to wear them.
49,30,"Those people, even the people who aren't racist. I'd be really surprised if Trump was actually racist."
53,30,...and I don't think it's in the sense that you're saying the fact that the ACA is the only one to stop HIV is offensive.
63,30,"In that video, he talks about how it's putting people in quarantines when they get sick."
73,30,"I agree with everything you wrote, but I'm not a doctor, I'm just an idiot, I'm against a government that is trying to get people to do what they love, I'm not against the government."
87,30,What are you saying about the masks in public?
92,30,It's funny because we are arguing here about how the EPA doesn't have enough authority to defend its own health and safety. The EPA doesn't have the power to fire someone for using the word mask in such a blatant fashion.
97,30,The president is in a hive mind.
30,24,Why is everyone wearing a mask not a joke?
30,27,My uncles dad was also a vaxxer and he still wants his dad to die. I think it is a pretty valid point and not a joke.
37,30,>Wearing a mask in public doesn't help prevent the spread of a virus.
39,30,This is just a joke.
48,30,"I feel ya. It's a joke that you don't even know the CDC. And then you call it a joke. It's not a joke, it's just a joking joke."
49,30,I would say if there is no way the government can change their policies that might prevent that he is racist.
53,30,"There are two sides to this. The first is that you can't get the vaccine by yourself if you don't have a mask on you. The second is that the first is for your own safety. It's not even the same for me and I'm glad they're not the same as you. You know, maybe it's just you but that is all there is to it."
63,30,"I know what you mean. I just realised that this is going to make people uncomfortable, and I just wanted to say something... I don't see a need to think about this."
73,30,I like to read more about this topic.
87,30,I don't understand how they can be blamed for these things.
92,30,The problem is the president has no reason to take a joke like this seriously. He's the lone wolf who can do what he wants and then continue to do what he wants.
97,30,"This is why so many of our people are fucking hate him. It’s just a joke on r/womenwhodidntknow. Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of a virus. Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it’s useless and I hate it. I’m surprised that the president of Georgia is a Republican. My brother is a racist and I know this because of the jokes he makes. He’s also in the news, so it’s pretty cool that he’s wearing"
30,24,This is one of the most offensive things I've heard on here today.
30,27,"That's exactly why I got the idea that I was against vaccinating my kids, even though it might be because of how much we spend on vaccination."
37,30,"So this isn't about the government, it's about the government. I mean, you can make fun of it, but it's not about that. It's not just that the president is a nutjob, it's that people get their own opinion about something that's not necessary and a government person is a person."
39,30,This is a good movie.
48,30,It's just the idea that they don't know the CDC and therefore the idea that they aren't really helping the spread of AIDS?
49,30,"The government can be an ally in making changes, but its not necessary."
53,30,I love it when I go out and do my daily chores. It's the perfect time to get up and go to work. And I'm gonna be able to put my face mask on and I don't want to be in a coma.
63,30,"I am not saying it is a troll joke, but it is a joke that the CDC wants to stop the spread of this virus. They can't do anything about it, they're just trying to prevent the spread. They are trying to stop the spread and they're not doing anything about it."
73,30,The whole point of this post is to show how sexist Obama is. I just wrote a piece that I think should have come up more often:
87,30,There's more to this than just twitchcon or the people who are willing to do so.
92,30,"The EPA is an outside agency, not a government. There isn't enough evidence to argue that a public nuisance, especially a hacked computer, is a threat. They're just making sure the public gets their hands on the necessary tools."
97,30,"'Man, I'm so sorry for your shit in the first place. I'm so sorry that you had to go through that. You were the bad guy."
30,24,I love to read about what people say about a government being an enemy.
30,27,I'm not sure where you are coming from but the word mask is a big part of it.
37,30,And you are still here. I'm sure you are still here.
39,30,I can't believe people are so sensitive about this.
48,30,"""You're probably a big fan of the government's anti-smoking campaign and have probably never heard of it. You're probably a big fan of the government's anti-smoking campaign and have probably never heard of it."""
49,30,>It’s a joke but i’m going to try and say it again and try to justify this and i’m going to just leave.'
53,30,"So, who wrote the piece to say?"
63,30,"It's really silly, ridiculous and they're not doing anything about it. They're just trying to prevent the spread and they're not doing anything about it. I don't think it's a joke, and I would not let the government take a back seat to protecting the public."
73,30,I'd like to point out that I did not even read the whole article. I can read the original article and not even recite the rest of it. But I really didn't understand the joke and I was confused.
87,30,> I think this is why people wear a mask in public.
92,30,"""I'm not against vacks mandates cuz they ruin the economy get people fired and people should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force."""
97,30,I don't have a problem with this at all.
30,24,The point of the whole issue is that sexism is inherently a dangerous issue.
30,27,I want to ask if you're on the right side of this and if you are on the wrong side of this.
37,30,"CANNOTANSWER: Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.'I think it's weird to wear a mask outside, but you don't know how to say that. I don't think it's too bad."""

53,30,"I read something called ""The Mask"" in the comments a few days ago. Not so much the comment, but the point."
63,30,Isn't this a joke? I thought it was a joke.
73,30,It sounds like they don't want to ban people from wearing a mask. They want to stop it.
87,30,I am a big fan of Twitchcon and I think a mask should be worn in public and should not be allowed to be worn at any time.
92,30,"It's been reported that the EPA has been being harassed by people who had an EPA mask on. It's not uncommon for people to be fired, but it's not uncommon to get people fired. I don't know how much the EPA is going to make the effort, but the truth is that it is not a safe situation and is not at risk of being taken seriously. I suspect the EPA has something to do with the EPA, so there isn't much they can do."

87,30,I don't really get what your comment is saying. I was just a little bit confused about why a government policy would prevent people from using masks and why a government policy would prevent people from being invading.
92,30,People are fired for not wearing a mask in the first place. It is very common.

39,30,"I don't even know the skunk, but i do remember the quote about the skunk, and I do think it's a good one."
48,30,"No kidding. It seems like we all agree that the government is a joke, but there are a lot of things that we don't understand....I'd be upset if someone told me it was a joke."
49,30,"*The president is an ally in making changes, but its not necessary. *The government can be an ally in making changes, but its not necessary."
53,30,The AMA is about the government being trying to prevent the spread of the virus.
63,30,This is what I do when I am sick:
73,30,I'm pretty sure the government is trying to shut the fuck up and stop people from getting vaccines. I can understand the whole joke and be in agreement with you. I do think it's the right thing to do.
87,30,"""Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
92,30,This is pretty much a common complaint of the Obama administration.
97,30,It's not a joke.
30,24,Yes. The AMA is all about the government being an enemy.
30,27,"""I don't know what a joke is, but I think it's a good idea to stop and be aware of this kind of thing. I am not sure whether that is a good thing or bad thing.

37,30,He also mentions in the movie that wearing a mask in public is a great idea and is not a crime (it's more about the government). Those people supposedly aren't interested in the idea of the government and the 'fuck you're the one who said it's not a joke.'
39,30,The joke about the skunk makes you laugh.

73,30,"This isn't a joke, it's a joke that isn't even written in the comic, the joke is being made based on the fact that the EPA and the CDC don't have the authority to regulate vaccines."
87,30,There is a whole other topic in this thread.
92,30,Is it really the only job in the US where you can be employed with the EPA?
97,30,Its not a joke. It is a joke. Its a joke.
30,24,I've heard a lot of people say the same thing and sometimes people just don't want to think about it. It's a joke because they're not interested in trying to change the rules.
30,27,"It’s the worst joke in the NFL, but that’s not the joke. I think it’s the right joke to do."
37,30,"You can't just ignore the fact that a people's health is being treated in a 'needy' way. This isn't a joke, it's just a joke."
39,30,I have a hat that's only worn when I vaccinate my body.
48,30,It's a joke because they're not good at the game. The government isn't the only one responsible for the spread of the virus. It is a joke because they don't want to get away with it.
49,30,"So, you've been at the top of every article on this topic (i.e., I was trying to find something that was actually sexist. I'm not a racist, ''I don't think he should be fired, he can be fired. ''I love it trump! I love it trump! I love it trump! I love the fact that he makes you feel safe for you!""''"
53,30,I'm so sorry for the late reply. It's too late. The wording isn't in any way relevant here.
63,30,The joke isn't funny. It's just a joke.
73,30,"i think the jokes are pretty good. The first person to actually imply that they're racist is also a joke. The second person is just saying that they're racist, because they're racist."
87,30,I think this is the first time he has been like that.
92,30,"Well, there is a big difference between wearing a mask and being fired, and being an employee, and the president being fired. The president has a right to have a problem with those choices."
97,30,I'm sorry to hear that. My brother had a AIDS hat on when he was at the NSA headquarters.

49,30,You seem to be being a little overly defensive here. It’s a prank. It’s not the government being an ally.
53,30,I can read the article. I can't even begin to get back to the guy who has the most positive answers. He is going to suck if he gets it.
63,30,"I didn't realize this was a joke, I saw a lot of people with HIV on the news and was not happy with it. I was not surprised that there were a lot of people in the news who aren't sick."
73,30,I'm not even a doctor.
87,30,A lot of people don't really get the point. The whole thing is a joke.

37,30,"Then wear a mask in public, but you don't know how to say that. If it's not a joke, it's a joke. I don't understand why people think it's a joke."
39,30,This is one of the first times I've read a single post where a guy wore a mask in his car. I remember him scolding me for making that joke about a guy he didn't really know. And I didn't. He wasn't a racist and he'd go around telling me that the people in the military are the one who did it and that they aren't the ones who actually did it.
48,30,...it doesn't get better.
49,30,"In this case, we really just need to stop calling them 'happily racists'. They're too much. We need a bigger conversation. We just don't have enough - it's ridiculous, not true. The point is, the country isn't allowing this to happen."

63,30,"I'm not sure I believe the government is going to give us a fuck about a mask or something that's not true or something. The whole ACA thing is a joke. I mean, the CDC is supposedly trying to stop the spread of a virus, it's not a joke, it's just a joke."
73,30,"This is why the ""sabotaging"" is so commonplace."

92,30,"No one, in my country, was fired for wearing a mask in public."

37,30,"""I think it's weird to wear a mask outside, but you don't know how to say that. If it's not a joke, it's a joke."""
39,30,The thing is that a lot of people seem to think that the ACA was a joke based on a number of factors. I think it's kind of interesting that people aren't able to understand that it's about the government doing something that makes the public aware and the EPA isn't the one with the power to stop it.
48,30,I don't care what you think about that. I don't care what it says.

87,30,"I think what this guy is saying is, ""Waving a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

30,24,"I feel it is a joke that is about the people who are supposed to have it on a hat. I know a lot of people who do, but I can't remember if they will ever do it.

73,30,...I think it's a joke. Its a joke because people want to be involved with the government.
