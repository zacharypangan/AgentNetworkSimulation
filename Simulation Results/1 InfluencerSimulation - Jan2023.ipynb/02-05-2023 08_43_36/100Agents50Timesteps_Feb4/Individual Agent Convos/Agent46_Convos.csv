52,46,You know what we're seeing on this r/nofaq thread in the real world?
54,46,"It is illegal to wear a mask outside of a public place, but not a federal office."
55,46,[Single sentence [Richness](http://richnesses.org/news/2011/06/Full_text_full_text_text_Full_text)
66,46,>We must take off our mask and turn ourselves in
68,46,That is what the op has been doing
73,46,Do you think wearing a mask means catching a virus? Or at least preventing the spread of a virus?
78,46,"In a medical class, they do it for free on their exams. That's not very effective for anyone who carries a virus or has had one."
82,46,I think you are correct. I'm not gullible but I'm gullible and submissive.
85,46,> Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.see this is how crazy trump s made the United States of america
90,46,The government has been campaigning to change the ACA so it's a bad idea to wear the mask to try to fight a virus like this.
97,46,"I can't stand the fact that if you put on your mask and make it look like you are a thug you will not believe it, the more you do it the worse it will be for you"
98,46,"trump and his supporters are saying that because the US has the same system as you are, the world should be in a better place."
52,46,Why the heck would you wear a mask? The government shouldn't have to wear one.
54,46,"I don't think you understand the importance of a mask and that, if you were to wear one when you were a kid, you would lose your license."
55,46,"I can't figure out how to do this, but if the person wants to help with the virus, they'll give you a face mask, but without that, there's no point."
66,46,"Regardless, wearing it properly would be against the law. It will stop the spread of a virus."
68,46,"I think it is the wrong answer here. The fact that she is wearing a mask is pretty much the same as someone not wearing a helmet. If the game isn't allowed to have a helmet with the weapon, she needs to wear it and be protected with it. It seems like the government has decided to start talking about that."
73,46,You should wear a mask.
78,46,:p I'd be so shocked if they just made the OP wear a mask because it has the same effect. Wearing a mask helps stop the spread of a virus.
82,46,"I wear a mask outside in my car. It's a mask with no fucking sense of humour, which is a bit disconcerting. Then I go outside in the morning and I'm so tired. But then I get out of the car. I can't seem to think of a way to fix my bad shit."
85,46,I don't know why people do not like wearing a mask. They can 't see where he is making it if the masks have the effect of putting people down. It seems to be the masks used to mask the mouth and throat. You are an idiot.
90,46,Does anyone know who's voted against this?
97,46,In some ways he is using it as a way to help stop the spread of a virus.
98,46,I think the mask thing is a good idea to be a bit harsh.
52,46,I think the nfl is trying to use it as an excuse to force you to wear a mask in the future. I'm really happy you are being positive.
54,46,[Try... wear a mask in your car with a sword. I can't be bothered with wearing one. I think it's pretty cool that people are allowed to wear the helmet that's just meant to stop the spread of a virus.
55,46,Ahhhhhh... I don't even know how to be a good person at scavenger hunts.
66,46,This is actually my favorite line of the whole episode and one of the most disturbing.
68,46,I think the only thing that matters is if the player is not wearing a mask he should be ashamed to wear it properly in public. Does it say the woman that wears a mask or is she wearing a mask? Or is it the same thing as the other posters saying it.
73,46,"If you have an asthma condition and have trouble breathing that's fine, you should consider a prescription. I can't say if this is the only way to stop you from having a hard time breathing. The question that's being asked is how many people wear the mask. I've had some trouble breathing because my asthma has a severe sinus infection."
78,46,I don't understand how you're supposed to feel about'sarcasm' and you want to be the only one to find it so funny.
82,46,It's not going to stop you from noticing what your driving like if you don't have your car on and on it. You'll just have to go to a doctor and see what you need to be doing. Whether you will want to wear a mask in your car is up to you.
85,46,I have no idea why. They have a lot of other things going on here.
90,46,Is the issue with the mask in your city really that difficult to work out?
97,46,https://r/reddittoculclert
98,46,"You really should cite the video you read. I'm really not sure if the idea is as good as the other posters have suggested, but I would be very curious to know if you're actually getting anything like this."
52,46,They should get a helmet with a mask and then keep it there for the nfl to keep an eye on when people are out in public.
54,46,"That's the idea. The thing that I don't understand is the fact that you've said the following. ""I wear a mask outside or in my car with a sword. I can't be bothered with wearing one. I think it's pretty cool that people are allowed to wear the helmet that's just meant to stop the spread of a virus."
55,46,In a few years I was told by a friend that he had never gone to a scavenger hunt before and it was very sad that it was over. When I was in public I'd sit outside and say the same thing.
66,46,"I can see why you think this is a little distasteful, because this whole thing is a really big one. I think I just read something like yours."
68,46,"A man wearing a mask isn't a white person. He is a female. he is not a man. I think the fact that the woman isn't wearing a mask is what you're getting at, which isn't so stupid."
73,46,I can't get out of the fucking house without a mask.
78,46,I think there is a point of being sarcastic.
82,46,"Wearing a mask outside is a crime. In the US you can wear a mask outside, but not in a car."
85,46,It sounds like the CDC found a very good source to make that up.
90,46,"I'm not going to lie, this happened in Denver. It's hard to believe that a state was swayed by the ACA."
97,46,"The guy is a twat. I don't really believe that you're describing his name because of his mask. I think the guy is a racist and hates the idea of being allowed to post about it. I don't think that's a good thing to do. I think that if you can't even put on your mask and you wear it to show your love, he will be hated and hated."
98,46,''Twas the joke I was thinking as well.
52,46,"""Mask"" is a good one."
54,46,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
55,46,The government is trying to tell you to stop wearing a mask. I think it makes sense that the gov't has a mandate to protect people from the spread of a virus. The US has an obligation to protect itself and protect others from the government.
66,46,>You haven't been to a game where I had to wear a mask and actually didn't.
68,46,"It doesn't sound like the movie is related, but you need to watch it."
73,46,"Apparently, I don't think the people that were using the joke were really smart and were willing to take a risk, which is really stupid, so I don't really want to be talking about it. They were saying something like, ""We should see if we have any more opportunities for people to wear masks. I would be uncomfortable with that. This will make it harder for us to get some support in the future."" And now we need to get out of the house without masks. It's gonna be a lot harder, right?"
78,46,"It's actually quite a common concept among people in the US to do something so stupid. The ACA does not affect the safety of our people, it doesn't prevent a lot of harm from our lives. If you are worried about the future of your country you should seek legal assistance for."
82,46,A mask does not stop people from seeing a dick in a car. A person wearing it in a car can not stop them from seeing a dick in a car. You can't tell the difference between wearing a mask outside and outside.
85,46,"It is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. The thing about wearing a mask is... you wear it and you eat pizza and you're not healthy? ""...I think the guy is an incompetent idiot who can eat a sandwich for his meal. He is also a degenerate who can eat pizza for his food. The trick is to eat more pizza. I do not eat that much pizza. That sounds like a really terrible movie."
90,46,I'm in the US and skunks wearing masks?
97,46,"People who wear a mask in the US do not know how to write ""a good "" and then they think that they are doing it to hurt people in their home country."
98,46,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
52,46,"A hat, a mask, and a helmet. You know what the president should wear, the masks and the hats are different things but both are very different things."
54,46,'Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.'
55,46,"No, it's not a problem. The government is acting as if it are the people making the jokes and people will tell you how it is being done. They can t be bothered to take it to the police and they cant."
66,46,I'm very disappointed with the EPA and the CDC's plans to cut costs of the vaccines and prevent the spread of AIDS.
68,46,It is also a good idea to use a mask to protect yourself while having a good time in public.
73,46,"I am also a woman and a fucking doctor, and my friend's boyfriend. He is a fucking sexist scumbag. I am also an asshole who wants to be the next guy to die. I'm not sure how much I would spend on a friend like this. It's really, really hard to explain to my kids that wearing a mask is a dangerous behavior."
78,46,"It's called ""Assisting the spread of a virus"""
82,46,"This is a good way to start off. You can wear a mask outside of your car, but you can't wear a mask in your car. You can wear a mask outside, but you can't wear a mask inside of a car."
85,46,That was a pretty bad movie.
90,46,"I don't see how it could be that that a doctor could find a way to help them, or that a woman was involved, that's just not acceptable."
97,46,The word mask makes the person look like a racist in the US and then in an instant they are blaming people for their actions. The fact that the guy is actually a racist doesn't change the point that he is talking about.
98,46,"[Donald Trump] wears a mask to prevent the spread of a virus. No one has said that before, but I can say that they are just as sexist as Donald J. Trump was. Why do you think this would be a good idea?"
52,46,"The article just started. ""Here's the video that you posted to r/nofaq... but it's very nice to read that there's a piece of evidence that the Obama administration is trying to influence the public about this"""
54,46,Try... wearing a mask in your car with a sword. I can't be bothered with wearing one. 
55,46,I've been to a lot of places where this happened.
66,46,"He's referring to the federal government's efforts to protect the public. He's trying to protect the public, which is absolutely ridiculous."
68,46,They're also attempting to portray the government as a sexist and anti-Semitic idiocy.
73,46,"The mask is supposed to protect his head from the air, and helps prevent a terrorist attack on him."
78,46,"I've worked in the military for many years, and I feel the ACA is in a way helping to prevent the spread of a virus."
82,46,I don't think it's an issue that the government would make a change that prevents it.
85,46,There is a lot going on here. This one:
90,46,"CANNOTANSWER : ""I just wrote an article about a skunk who swore a mask to my local school on my birthday and she told me to have a backup plan for that. I don't see how it could be that a doctor could find a way to help them, or that a woman was involved, that's just not acceptable."""
97,46,I think it's funny that the guy gets hated for wearing a mask while in the U.S. It's the point they make to prevent people from being fucked up by a president. I think they're trying to be racist because they don't want to be hated for wearing a mask.
98,46,"I've heard the same things. I would take off my mask because I do. If they didn't want to be in a movie, I'd cite the video I read. I don't want to be in a movie with anyone who doesn't see it."
52,46,"> They should do something for the government. I think there are many examples that support that, but I don't really think it's what they're supposed to be doing. I think that's the first thing they should have done. The CDC's not the king of the internet. The CDC is not the king of the internet. What if it were us? Who did you believe that was a lie? The CDC is trying to make people wear masks. They have a hat, the hat, and the helmet."
54,46,"Apparently the government is invading this nation, and it's not possible to stop the spread of a virus, as a result of this mandate."
55,46,"I'm going to go give you some links, but I've never heard of the EPA or any of the CDC doing this."
66,46,Neither of you haven't been to a game where I had to wear a mask and actually didn't.''
68,46,"It's not really a joke, because I know that it's in reference to the movie and not an actual actual discussion on the film. I do believe that if a joke like this gets downvoted, it's probably just just a remark about people being uncomfortable with the idea."
73,46,"In some ways the EPA is using the term 'fake' to refer to any government policy that is designed to prevent people from wearing a mask. They are bringing it up - in other words, they are putting it on the side of the EPA as a warning for people to wear masks."
78,46,It's not funny. It's a really funny and interesting idea that makes the ACA work.
82,46,"It's also an issue that the government has no ability to solve, if any, and is making a mistake because they don't know how to solve the problem. It's a bad idea to say anything when people aren't doing it."
85,46,You're gonna say what's the point of wearing a mask if people haven't got it.
90,46,The state was not swayed by the ACA.
97,46,There are a couple things on reddit that make me laugh out loud:
98,46,It's a funny one. You think the person has no idea about how to respond to the people who are getting it? That's a joke.
52,46,"The author of the article made an entire post about this in r/nofaq. I'm not referring to the ACA. I'm referring to the US and it is pretty much the only one that he knows of. He's just pointing out the fact that he's not doing anything wrong, and the CDC needs to figure out what's best for everyone."
54,46,"[In my opinion, not really. This is actually what I'm saying. It's not the law that's making the issue more prominent, but the ACA is a good one."
55,46,"It is not a joke that the government should be doing this. The issue is not that they are trying to prevent a virus, it's that they are taking steps to stop it from spreading."
66,46,>I'm very disappointed with the EPA and the CDC's plans to cut costs of the vaccines and prevent the spread of AIDS.
68,46,I think it's very hard to see why the guy who made the joke would even have a problem with the movie.
73,46,So the EPA wants to shut down the EPA and stop people wearing masks?
78,46,"I don't understand why he didn't include ""healing a virus"" in his response to that comment."
82,46,Why do they wear a mask in cars?
85,46,"> I don't know why people do not like wearing a mask. They can 't see where he is making it if the masks have the effect of putting people down.

They have a lot of other things going on here.'', 'I have no idea why.', ''. ''."
90,46,The movie was not going to be a good movie.
97,46,"OP. This isn't racist, it's just about being racist."
98,46,"A rebuttal: ""If you think Donald J. Trump is doing the right thing by not wearing a mask at all."
52,46,"I don't know what the real reason for this joke is, but when he was in the military it was a bit of a prick. You know he got shot in the head and I'm not saying the CDC is the king of the internet. What if it were US? Who did you believe that was a lie?"
54,46,"Honestly, I would never agree with anyone's statement that a CDC report is needed to prevent the spread of a virus. I'm not sure what's gotten him off a limb because the CDC finds that people with HIV are more likely to get sick and will pass a vaccination. In addition, if you have any children, you will have a low prevalence of HIV in your community. The idea of wearing a mask in a public place is a stupid but completely legitimate issue."
55,46,Wearing a mask helps prevent the spread of a virus. It's a joke.
66,46,They are not trying to stop people from getting sick. They are trying to prevent the spread of AIDS. They are putting on the masks to prevent the spread of the virus.
68,46,"This is a nice and short movie. I don't think any of these are valid facts, but a good one is a good one."
73,46,>I think that people are being naive and thinking this is a joke.
78,46,I'm going to try to explain how you were being sarcastic about something so stupid and the president / Obamacare campaign.
82,46,"I've had a lot of issues with the Obamacare health care program - not that I think it would work, but rather how it could work."
85,46,You're so clever. Why do people need a mask. How can you imagine how much money the government could have made to get the vaccine? Why would you wear one?
90,46,"I agree with other parts, but he is trying to explain the issue with an article about a skunk who swore a mask to my local school and she told me to have a backup plan for that. I don't see how that can be an issue for the skunk, or that the woman involved is involved."
97,46,There is a story about a man wearing a mask and a racist being asked what he wants.
98,46,"I am so excited for the film, and I think I'll take a couple of minutes to get a rebuttal on the film."
52,46,"He's not referring to the ACA, which the President has said is ""a joke."" He's referring to how they are supposed to force people to wear masks."
54,46,"In this case, the school should get an AMA for a skunk."
55,46,"If you're the guy who says ""I think it makes sense that the gov't has a mandate to protect you from the spread of a virus. The EPA and the CDC are very wrong, because they are using a language that makes no sense. They are talking about what skunks need to wear."""
66,46,"I'm not sure who's going to take this seriously. I don't think you will find a source for it, because I am not sure what you think OP was talking about. But there isn't that many of the information that would be worth looking at."
68,46,I've also noticed that I don't think this one is very well written. It was really funny.
73,46,EPA is putting on a mask to protect people from respiratory infections.
78,46,"I'm not really sure where you are getting the sarcasm from, but that's not exactly a valid point and I'd be interested to hear if you've ever read the article."
82,46,CANNOTANSWER: People should get the EPA to get rid of the federal government. They can fire people who don't comply with the regulations and would be fired for violating them.
85,46,Is the avv the movie?
90,46,"It's the opposite of ""Hysterical."" It means that it doesn't need to be ""Scary"" or ""Hysterical""."
97,46,"So it's like the President of the United States is a fucking racist, but you think that it's more racist than being a racist, and you think he's racist and racist? Why is he saying ""yes"" to what his family thinks? :p"
98,46,[Advertising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising):

55,46,"That is how it works. I mean... I mean it's a little strange that people get so upset at it, but this is the way it is fucked up. There are still people who are upset that this has been happening. Specifically, it's a joke about a guy who is infected with HIV/AIDS. I've gotten sick of it all the time. I know what they're talking about, but it still seems like a joke... like when I do a thing and I'm doing it myself I don't care what people"
66,46,Is that you? I'm sick and I'm not getting sick and not sure what's going on here.
68,46,The CDC and other non-profit organizations are the ones that get the most hate.
73,46,"No, that's what a joke is. It sounds like a prank. The joke isn't about the EPA, a fake EPA hat, or the people who wear it, or the people who don't care enough about it to know what it is."
78,46,This is the one thing that scares me about this project - a government that's basically doing what the people in power are doing.
82,46,The fact that they can fire people for violating the federal laws is another example of the government's failure to implement a program that would prevent skunks from using their cars.
85,46,Are you trying to say that people shouldn't wear masks and not people can wear a mask? Because if a mask is effective it can help prevent and treat HIV/VHC in humans.
90,46,It's not exactly a skunk-friendly movie.
97,46,"""The only reason that a hat screams racist is because the person is making racist jokes and isn’t actually aware of them, and therefore doesn’t really care about the joke.

The only reason that a hat screams racist is because the person is making racist jokes and isn’t aware of the joke."
98,46,"The question was, ""I think a petty joke is a joke."" I thought the answer was: that a hat is a joke, while a hat is a joke, isn't a joke, and isn't a joke? ""."
52,46,I don't think the CDC is being a king of the internet. He was not a prick. It's not a joke. CDC is not a king of the internet.
54,46,I don't think it is the right thing to do. If I were in the public eye I would be wearing a mask and a mask without the ACA being legal.
55,46,"So, I'm saying a bit of the prank is that the CDC is using 'terrorist' as a joke and that this isn't a joke??"
66,46,"I don't even care what the guy said, I don't like the hivemind."
68,46,"""The FBI, the FDA, and the CDC are all responsible for preventing this and infecting the public."
73,46,What is the problem of being a nutjob? Do you know the answers to these questions?
78,46,Nope. It's not an official joke. I am not sarcastic.
82,46,The only thing I see on the EPA is that they are violating the anti-virus laws of our country and they do not have a criminal license.
85,46,I think a mask is an option and a good reason to not buy it.
90,46,>I've read the AMAs on this sub and it's a lot more than what you are asking. That’s not exactly a skunk-friendly movie.
97,46,"I hate those things because they're a bit ridiculous. I hate to complain about it but it's a nice joke, I don't even like it."
98,46,"The question is ""Will there be a movie about this guy wearing a mask to prevent the spread of a virus?"""
52,46,"The CDC should have put the skunks on public health, because that's a very valid excuse."
54,46,They said the ACA was a joke and the CDC didn't mean it was a good idea but it is a joke.
55,46,The question is why do people wear masks?
66,46,There is an article about the NFL on a TIL thread.
68,46,The NSA is working on the prevention of HIV/AIDS in the NFL.
73,46,>It's really sad to see the government slashing off a bunch of people who haven't been vaccinated despite many warnings.
78,46,The entire point of the ACA is to protect Americans from the threat of life-threatening illnesses. Its not a joke. Its just a joke.
82,46,"""I don't think it's an issue that the government has no ability to solve, if any, and is making a mistake because they don't know how to solve the problem."""
85,46,Is wearing a mask a good reason to not buy it a joke?
90,46,"What a stupid idea, as you have said."
97,46,"> ""The only reason that the guy gets hated for wearing a mask is because the person is making racist jokes and isn't aware of them. The only reason that the man is wearing a mask is because the person is making racist jokes and isn't aware of them, and therefore doesn't really care about the joke."
98,46,"It's a hat and a joke, but it's a hat. It's a joke and a joke."
52,46,That is pretty much the main point that CANNOTANSWER is making.
54,46,I think that's the problem. The issue is that if people had been able to get HIV or something the government wouldn't have to keep it from them in the first place.
55,46,People should wear masks and not wear them as much as they want. People should never knowingly commit this kind of behavior to an innocent and innocent person.
66,46,"The NSA has also been in the news with a smear campaign against the NFL. They're being forced to take the word ""protect the public"" and ""speak to the public"" which is a ""no-no-no-no"" on their part."
68,46,"So the CDC, FDA and CDC are all responsible for preventing HIV/AIDS?"
73,46,"The joke is about the skunk problem, the health care act, the government, the CDC, and so on. The skunk problem isn't really a joke."
78,46,"No, it's not a joke. It's a joke. If someone's joking, then no sarcasm."
82,46,Is this a comedy or a book about the government?

The ACA is very much about a lack of a government mandate. It’s not about how they want to get the government to do everything they can to help. The ACA is very much about a lack of a political agenda.
97,46,"You don't like it, but it is really funny that someone who was being a joke about an entire bunch of hats actually is a racist hat."

54,46,"The ""It is just a joke that people want to do""."

52,46,I think the article is a lot about how the government's trying to make people wear masks.
54,46,It was the worst joke in the movie IMO. It has an interesting message.
55,46,A person who wears a mask is a joke. A woman is a joke. A man is a joke.
66,46,A few of these examples are related to a joke... The government is trying to force the use of vaccines in the US which is obviously racist.
68,46,"The NRA has become a joke and hasn't spoken. So, the question was more of if they think a man wearing a mask should wear it properly, or if she needs to wear it properly in public, and if the movie isn't allowed to have a helmet with the weapon, then it's not a joke."
73,46,"... is a joke, because I think that it isn't funny."

85,46,"This is why people wear masks so much. There are no jokes, a lot of jokes, etc. So, why do people not wear masks? Because it sounds like that is how they think. The ACA is a joke, it is a joke. It is the problem."
90,46,''There's nothing wrong with wearing a mask in public places. The ACA was not passed by a board of education. They are trying to get the government to do everything they can to help. The ACA is very much about a lack of a political agenda.

97,46,"I'm not racist. You're right. I can't tolerate the president of a country that is so obviously based off of a story. If you don't think it's racist, try to figure out if you can take your first joke, or if you can't think of any other way to express your views on it."
98,46,It was a joke and they should be in a movie about it.
52,46,"They're trying to make people wear masks to prevent the spread of HIV. I don't think that's fair because they're causing more damage to public health and we can't resent them if they don't do that. They need to try to keep people from wearing masks so that people can't get skunky, and the skunks will get the vaccine."

52,46,"The CDC wants to do the right thing for people, not the people. If you don't like the ACA, don't."
54,46,I am very confused. I don't get why people are asking if it's a joke. The person just told me that he did the right thing and that he wouldn't be able to do anything if they were doing anything.

68,46,A mask is not supposed to prevent the spread of a virus. It's supposed to prevent a virus from causing it to spread. The US government does not make masks and it's part of the vaccine system.
73,46,"In the US, not only does it take more time to make a joke and stop doing it, it can be a sign that you are a smart, rational, and compassionate person, and that you don't want your life or your family in danger.

82,46,The NSA is trying to change the laws and the EPA is making the ACA into a statutory form that prohibits the EPA from putting a helmet on in a car that's not a criminal infringement. EPA is not suing anyone who doesn't comply with the regulations and issuing the CDC.

66,46,The CDC and NRA both have a very specific agenda for the US. They may do something a little more conservative to get in touch with the private health care workers. I think they're not going to be able to stop the spread. The government is probably trying to get in touch with the private health care workers and do nothing.
