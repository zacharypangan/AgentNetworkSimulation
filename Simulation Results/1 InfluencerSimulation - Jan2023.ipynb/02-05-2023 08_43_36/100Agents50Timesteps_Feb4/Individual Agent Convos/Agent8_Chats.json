    ">Waving a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. There is a law about it. It's not going to be enforceable, the government won't enforce it. And there are ways to make it enforceable.",
    "I think this is an important point, that it should not be taken out of context, because if someone has the opportunity to do that, then I wouldn't have the time.",
    "Vaccination is an anti-vaccination campaign. I'm sure some of the people you've said are right.",
    "I've been to two events where I was a fan of the CDC and I haven't wore a mask. It was a good idea to be there but I didn't want to risk being in the CDC's hands. I'd like to see some evidence that there is a government agency that has actually had a go at it and is working on it. I think there is also something that the CDC needs to investigate.",
    "I've come across an article recently where the CDC is working with TFW to get the federal government to make vaccine mandatory. Not all states have it. So it's not unreasonable to be against the ACA. The CDC wants to make a law that allows them to apply it.",
    "I have had more than my fair share of the stuff I'm going to post here.",
    "I'd be willing to bet that if the CDC were to pass it, it'd be in the hands of a few people. If I ever get into a fight, I'll be more than willing to get a new one.",
    "It\u2019s very true. As a man who has lived in the U.S. for 10 years, and has no interest in vaccinating myself, and I don\u2019t want to get in the way of the CDC (and the federal government) and try to keep me in a vaccinated state and do not mind not wanting to be vaccinated when they think it\u2019s too much work and risk, I\u2019m not sure how I would do that with the government and I think it\u2019s unfair. I also don\u2019t have a right to know that this is",
    "I just read your response: Vaccination is illegal.",
    "Vaccination is a mandate, and the government is enforcing it, if they have a reason to enforce it. If they don't, then that's not the case.",
    "As someone who's fought for over 20 years, I can say that the current congress is being extremely irrational and sexist. This was never the case.",
    "TWitchcon was a big part of the anti-vaccination movement.",
    "If I could take the mask off, would I be able to get on and on with my job? Because I have no insurance so I can get off and on with my job?"
