47,28,those who want to protect themselves from getting sick have every right to masks keep you more safe than no mask in tight settings everyone has the right to do whatever they want now at their discretion
48,28,i was late but i gotta hand it to he s got me wearing my mask everywhere and my area is spiking hard right now just signed up to get me and the wife a drive up test come saturday
73,28,oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that
74,28,i m going to say this about twitchcon and masks you can hate me if the state town doesn t have an mandates you can t get mad that an event doesn t not sure if sd has any mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask
82,28,if you wear a mask outside or in your car alone your gullible and submissive not traits you want to project
91,28,how does the mask make his breath come out of the back of his head
99,28,oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that
47,28,You got it. You want the NSA to stop spreading the virus?
48,28,i had my mask on and it didn't look like it was going anywhere
73,28,I don't really know how it all works.
74,28,"Vaccinating people with boosters is the only mandate I would like, but the sd state has a lot to work with."
82,28,Is it an antimicrobial product like a vaccine?
91,28,i can not stand the thought of not wearing a mask in a crowded place
99,28,You can't have a bad time in a community where a public health official is unable to wear a mask. You can only have one bad day in a community where a public health official has a mandate to be wearing a mask.
47,28,"You guys are a huge fan of the NSA. Its really just a joke. I don't know about your comments, but I have read an article a few times that alot of people are still arguing that it does help prevent any health problems. This includes the virus, but not the vaccine."
48,28,"You've got to be a doctor to prevent this disease, right?"
73,28,IANAL but what if the guy wanted to use a mask?
74,28,"What are some states that have a mandatory vaccination program, where there are still no mandates?"
82,28,"I know a man who isn't gullible and submissive, but I've learned to say it's important for his safety. He shouldn't be able to 'feel' his breath coming out of his car, just a mask."
91,28,"IMHO if you were a football coach you'd be a troll. He didn't want to get an AMA or TAX in public, so he could not get an AMA, so they did it anyways."
99,28,I think if someone had an attitude like this I'd be pretty uncomfortable with it because I was afraid they'd get upset and I'd hate to get them involved in the next phase of that conversation.
47,28,"I'm very a big fan of this movie, and can't stop laughing at the lack of any evidence. I can't do a hat or anything like that. Despite the fact that I like wearing masks, I don't think people care enough to wear them because of the fact that they aren't very good for protecting themselves, and aren't so sure that they're the right thing to do if they want to."
48,28,"We have a virus called B. espiron. In order to spread it, you need a mask. A full head mask, and an eye mask."
73,28,> I thought it was funny that he had a hard time breathing due to a mask.
74,28,"I love the video. There are so many interesting topics, and I don't understand what's going on here. It's hard to see why the 'common sense of humor' we are seeing here isn't a positive thing for a guy who doesn't wear a mask. It's a bad idea if you don't like the'sense of humor'. Clearly they're not that good, but they're very different things and they aren't necessarily trying to make people aware that it would be hard to change. It'"
82,28,"I'm a bit of a nerd, but I'm not stupid enough to go out on a limb."
91,28,I have never had a medical problem because of this mask. But when I was a medical student I had to wear a mask for a few days and I had to wear a mask a few days ago.
99,28,"""I was a narcissist who was allergic to a couple of septic shocks and a thigh ache in my teens. I don't understand what the problem is."
47,28,"A lot of Americans are going to think that the government is a threat to their health. I'm not sure the CDC has any scientific evidence to prove that vaccinations are effective, but that's not exactly true."
48,28,"I'm gonna say this is what the whole world needs to see from a policy perspective, but it's not the way it should be. This doesn't happen to us every time we have a virus or an epidemic. If they want to avoid it, they don't have to."
73,28,"> ""I think the idea of wearing a mask for the purpose of saving the economy really that simple."
74,28,"""... because a rapist and a rapist is going to put us in danger and that makes you stupid and bad. I'm sick of TWitchCon and Twitchcon, I'm sick of TwitchCon and TwitchCon."
82,28,Wearing a mask outside is not a crime. It seems that the government is allowing the person wearing a mask to wear anything outside of the car in the car.
91,28,"There's a line in the article that says the helmet is just that, not to help the skunks. That's basically the point of the film."
99,28,">I don't think the government has a ""toy"" for ""sick"" sex? Its about the government, not your masks."
47,28,"My friends said ""that's not the right thing to do if you want to."" I'm trying to help them. They were told by their friends, but we didn't tell them and it wasn't the correct thing to do."
48,28,"I have been in many countries in Asia. It isn't common, but it's not like every nation has a vaccine for it."
73,28,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.He's trying to force the person to wear a mask. They have to pay for their masks. They will cost them money, and the cost of the mask is based on who wears them, and not who isn't. You don't have to wear a mask to keep them away."
74,28,I can't be more wrong than this:
82,28,I think it's hard to believe that this is even a question. There isn't a law on the books regarding this.
91,28,"I've been in the news a couple times and I've always been skeptical of how effective a mask is, but I really think it's important to get people to accept it and agree to accept it, even when people are concerned about the impact. It's an interesting way to go to the extent of a lot of people and it's not very helpful to them in this case."
99,28,"The ""toy"" for sex is about the government, not your masks. They have mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters. Because it makes people less prone to contract and vaccinating. Its the ejaculation of the ejaculation and the fear of getting sick, which is what a lot of people don't understand. Its like putting on the mask to protect you from the sun from the sun, and then letting them go."
47,28,I think this is a good response to something I haven't had in a long time. I can't believe people haven't learned from the comments here on this subreddit.

73,28,He's trying to convince people that a'meat allergy' is somehow an excuse to wear a mask. It's a very expensive thing and you'll probably need a much better - mask than an adult.
74,28,"I think the problem here is that the whole issue isn't the'sense of humor'. That it isn't a positive thing because people think it's funny. But to put it simply, they don't have the same sense of humor as you. The point is, they're not being as good as the TWitchcon incident. 'I'm sick of TWitchcon and TWitchcon, I'm sick of TWitchCon and TwitchCon and TwitchCon."
82,28,Wearing a mask outside is a crime in the US.
91,28,"""I have never had a medical problem because of this mask. But when I was a medical student I had to wear a mask a few days ago."
99,28,The government should keep it on the side of the people and tell people that they can't be abused or criticized because it is a joke.
47,28,"I am a doctor and i do not follow a good diet, i am not a doctor."
48,28,"[Sir], you know how the internet works?"
73,28,"Are you saying the government is using the term ""fake"" as a security tool?"
74,28,He could be saying that the only problem with a mask is the fact that he is a dickhead because of what he's doing.
82,28,"The only problem is the government is not getting their way, and it's almost certainly not a crime in the US."
91,28,There is a lot of talking about people being able to have their head removed.
99,28,"That doesn't mean they shouldn't have a job, because of all the laws about the government's anti-vaccination policy."
47,28,"Vaccines are not an effective tool in that respect. The only person who's done that is a politician, but someone who hasn't actually done anything on a health care issue. If they can't help, then they need to talk to a medical doctor."
48,28,A good hat and a mask are both good idea in cases of infection. It's not really the government's job to make a joke.
73,28,This seems like an obvious reference for the government. Do you believe in the federal government?
74,28,The problem here is that the whole issue isn't the'sense of humor'. That it isn't a positive thing because people think it's funny.
82,28,"It isn't a crime in the US, it's a good way to start a conversation. There are plenty of people in the US who aren't gullible and submissive. It seems the only way the government is getting their way is to tell people they need to go outside their car to shit themselves."
91,28,"EPA and NRA have no authority to change the health care system, 'but that's probably why it's a big problem. It's just a bad idea."
99,28,I can't see how this would get any better if people wouldn't take it as a joke. It's probably just because it's not the most important aspect of the article.
47,28,The CDC does not have a mandate to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS.
48,28,I don't know why anyone's not getting a mask. I think its important to keep it. I'd be upset if someone told me it was a joke.
73,28,Apparently the government is using 'fake' as a security tool.
74,28,"They aren't really doing that to stop the spread of a virus. They are doing so to try and make things funnier, because we aren't doing anything serious or interesting. It's probably better than a lot of things they're talking about."
82,28,"I don't know. I think you're going to a conversation on why people like it, because I do know that people in the US are gullible and submissive. This isn't a crime, because people who like this stuff don't think it's a crime, because they think that people are so gullible and submissive. And people who want to get a virus because they think it's a big deal, that they're trying to try to get someone out of their house, and that's not an issue."
91,28,I was just going to point out that this is a great movie and that you are not alone in being skeptic in this way.
99,28,"Vaccination is an important part of protecting children and the public from a deadly virus. You can wear a mask, however you want. You can wear a mask as a guard for your child, as long as your child is healthy, and your parents are free to do so."
47,28,Vaccines are not really an effective tool.
48,28,"""I'm gonna say this is what the whole world needs to see from a policy perspective, but it's not the way it should be. I'm gonna say this is what the whole world needs to see from a policy perspective, but it's not the way it should be."""
73,28,"I've read a couple of these things. ""Are you saying the government is using the term ""fake"" as a security tool?"
74,28,Why are there so many things they're talking about?
82,28,That is how I define shit
91,28,"Yes, but it’s still a bad idea because the government wants to cut a skunk guy’s head. It’s an interesting way to go to the extent of a lot of people and it’s not very helpful to them in this case. It’s also not an AMA, nor is it an AMA, and they are just trying to force people to buy it."
99,28,I'm just gonna go with my own opinion. The government is a government and this is not a joke.
47,28,The CDC isn't a good thing.
48,28,CANNOTANSWER is a great resource and a great source for info.
73,28,"[As of now, I'm still on the internet trying to figure out what you are saying here. I do not know what you are saying.](http://www.nip.com/stn/news_articles.aspx)"
74,28,TIL that wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.Vaccines aren't legal anymore.
82,28,"The CDC just told the same thing, and they did a good job. I would just keep looking up the rules and trying to do what they are supposed to do."

48,28,"The problem is, you can make a joke to make it worse for the person you do not have a good reason to stop."
73,28,> I hate the idea of wearing a mask. It's just a tool of the government to help prevent and eradicate the spread of a virus.
74,28,You have some serious narcissists here.
82,28,EPA is in charge of regulating the skunk problem.
91,28,The NRA is a bunch of terrorists.
99,28,"Vaccination is a joke, and a joke about the government being in a position to stop it. This is about the government being in a position to stop it from happening."
47,28,...and that the government is not doing anything about the problem
48,28,">""You're probably a big fan of the government's anti-smoking campaign and have probably never heard of it."
73,28,It's the government that's slapping off millions of people who can't afford to get a vaccine.
74,28,"People just don't believe they need a mask. A mask, and in general, is a joke. But it's not a joke. If a virus spreads in the US it can't get in a US citizen's head."
82,28,It's part of the anti-virus epa's responsibilities and it's not just a crime.
91,28,CANNOTANSWER:
99,28,I’m gonna say a little bit of humor.
47,28,I'm actually interested in the sex act in the AMA i think the sex act has a good message in it - its about giving vaccines to the person who's being infected and then getting an injection to stop them from wasting their time.
48,28,...I'd be upset if someone told me it was a joke.
73,28,I don't have any real answers to these questions. I do have very hard time figuring out what it is that people are not comfortable with and that if people did want to wear a mask they would be uncomfortable.
74,28,"I'm not saying that wearing a mask isn't a positive thing, but I think the point is, that's a bad idea."
82,28,I don't like skunks. I don't care if they try to make me look good. I'll be very upset if you put me in a skunk pose.
91,28,"In the article, the quote from the article states the NRA has no authority to change the health care system and it would be more helpful for them to accept it. The AMA is about a young guy getting a vaccine and a skunk guy who is trying to make the government look stupid."
99,28,I'd think that the government has some sort of problem here.
47,28,The CDC is trying to repress public health. What he said isn't true.
48,28,"I agree with the other person about hats, but...the problem is, you can make a joke to make it worse for the person you do not have a good reason to stop....the best thing to do is to say ""I like you"" and ""I love you"""" instead of pointing out his frustration with the joke."
73,28,"[NAME] - ""I think the idea of wearing a mask for the purpose of saving the economy really that simple."
74,28,Vaccines aren't legally legal anymore.
82,28,Those are not the kinds of things that are allowed to go outside the car unless it's your own car.
91,28,"In order to avoid the public bringing up that the US government does not have authority to change the health care system, you need a public forum for everyone to discuss the issue, which is why the AMA is necessary, but also the NRA needs to talk about the issue and give you the context for it."
99,28,"I'm in a situation where I do not understand the meaning of 'petty joke', and my wife is so scared she is not allowed to wear a mask. I can't imagine her feeling that way, especially at age ten. I can't imagine her being able to wear a mask even if she is ill. I don't understand how the government is trying to prevent the spread of viruses, and I don't understand how they are bringing it up."
47,28,What is the sex act about?
48,28,"""...I'd be upset if someone told me it was a joke."""
73,28,I can understand the whole joke and be in agreement with you. I do think it's the right thing to do.
74,28,There are no mandates on how to take a virus.

82,28,That's a big part of the reason for the federal government's decision not to fire people for this. I'm going to put out a few more of these comments.
91,28,The author of the article doesn’t seem to know how to be a good guy.
99,28,"I'm going to go on the one page post and say ""I don't get why the government is trying to be a joke. They are trying to make us go out of our way to help them. So let's do that."""
47,28,The ACA is a joke.

91,28,AMA (The article goes on to state that the EPA and NRA have no authority to change the health care system...)
99,28,"In a country with so much public health care, and a bunch of medical devices to prevent the spread of viral disease, it's really not a joke, but it's a bit of a joke that people don't understand."
47,28,"Vaccines are good, but not exactly a joke : AIDS is the most effective anti-viral vaccine we have ever seen."
48,28,"As a person who has never read the AMA, this does seem like a great way to get rid of a lot of things like ""Don't think it's a joke, but what the point of this post is is that the government has no authority to prevent the spread of a virus."
73,28,So what about this guy with the mask.
74,28,There is actually a difference between wearing a mask and using a mask for a fight. A nutjob joke is a joke.
82,28,"It is a crime to wear a mask outside of a public place, because it's dangerous to your health.

74,28,I am so sorry I am not seeing your comment.
82,28,EPA has a policy to do it in order to make it difficult for people to avoid harming them. I'm not trying to go against the rules but I'm working on this right now to keep the CDC up to date with it.

91,28,A skunk could get a raging outbreak of a nasty viral infection.
99,28,I have been having a lot of narcissism recently. I had this idea that we were going to have some kind of vaccine that could prevent the spread of a deadly disease. I went through this when my boyfriend took me to a doctor to have sex. But I could've had that as well.
47,28,Vaccines aren't a joke. The CDC is preventing it from being repealed because the ACA isn't exactly an effective way to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS.
48,28,"As a person who doesn't have a doctor background, it sounds like I have something to talk about. I think it's a good way to get advice, but I can't say I can tell if it is a joke, but it's a great way to get rid of a lot of things like ""Don't think it's a joke, but what the point of this post is is that the government has no authority to prevent the spread of a virus."""
73,28,The whole prank is going to be about people wearing masks in their work. And there are people who a lot of people can't understand.
74,28,"I am so sorry, I don't see what you are saying."
82,28,It's one of the reasons why the EPA and CDC are trying to snatch a lot of jobs.
91,28,Is it possible that he might be in the right for an AMA?
99,28,I'm so sorry but the CDC has gone from being an anti-vaccination organization to being a anti-vaccination organization because of the CDC shaming them for taking their job at the government seriously.
47,28,I have been in the country for 6 years now and it's been very hard.

74,28,Vaccination is illegal in Texas. But ''weird'' isn't a joke.
82,28,It sounds like the EPA is trying to bring the problem of skunks to the people.
91,28,Is the NRA just trying to force the government to change the health care system?
99,28,"Because of the CDC, there is a big difference between a joke and a joke. A good piece of literature about the government has been found to be misleading. I've never heard an article about it."

74,28,You're very rude. That's a joke.
82,28,That’s not exactly a 'criminal act' either. The government should take more action to prevent the spread of a virus or make it legal.
