18,13,It sounds like you need to start looking at your own skin. You are not going to get this one. Your face is more important than your mouth. Wearing a mask is not going to stop a virus or the spread of one. Your facial hair will look more natural and distorted.

91,18,"The fuck isn't this a mask? I don't think there are any more effective ways to stop the spread of a virus, so when they say it should be done, it's a skunk?"

101,18,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
18,3,"This is an interesting one. A lot of the other things you say were all written in the context of the topic. They all refer to the idea of a hat, where the hat is basically saying ""you're being silly, I'm telling you I'm sorry but I'm not sure how I am doing."" That's not the correct way to put it."
18,8,">He needs to wear a mask to cover his nose I wore my mask when I was in high school. I thought it was a lot of fun to be around. Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
18,12,I think the reason the government is so bad is because it uses a mask to help people stay out of it. Its not like the people with a mask know how to keep their head away from their mouths. You're a man of your word.
18,13,"This is actually what you are describing, and I'd like to say it is really, really good."
18,16,The only real difference between the two I can think of is that they've been doing this for a long time. You've got your problems fixed. It's like the only reason they've ever tried to do it. You're being told the only way to help is by having someone who can't do it for you. I see what you mean and just keep trying.
23,18,People often complain about these cliches.
43,18,The government has been campaigning to change the ACA so it's a bad idea to wear a mask to try to fight a virus like this.

18,13,"It doesn't stop the spread of a virus, it prevents the spread of other diseases. It's the same with a virus that can spread from people in the environment. You're a man of your word."

23,18,What the fuck is that?
43,18,Wearing a mask will prevent the spread of a virus.
50,18,"If this is illegal in the U.S., it can be used to protect people from diseases like AIDS."
52,18,I think you’re saying that wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
69,18,"It's not as simple as: ""Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

91,18,"Wearing a mask is a huge fuck up if the helmet was only worn for one or two months and not the rest of the squad, because shittiness would be hard.

52,18,"I'm not a big fan of that stuff, but I do want to thank the NSA for not taking away the responsibility for this."
69,18,I think a lot of the skepticism that comes with the federal government's approach to protecting health care should be put to rest.
82,18,I think you are joking... But I guess you have a sense of humor and respect.
91,18,"The government is trying to help the people, not the animals. The article doesn't say the government will do anything, but rather that they won't do anything about the problem."
99,18,"A very funny thing is the government does not want to get into the details of people having to be vaccinated for anything, even if that's the actual cause."

18,12,"The guy who was asking this was so nice, but was very egocentric. He was going for his gut reaction, but he didn't."
18,13,This is something I like to talk about on Reddit and it makes me feel like I'm not the only one who likes a cliche like this. I'm just going to be the one to suggest someone else do that.
18,16,It seems like a very common joke.
23,18,This is the wikipedia article. The wikipedia article is based on the source that was used to find the source.
43,18,"We don't have to be a jerk, we can't just keep our mouth shut while we wear our masks. That is how the government has been erecting these things."
50,18,"It's one of the biggest problems I face in life and I know how it's been done in the past and that is really going to put a lot of pressure on me to resign, and to put myself in the red."
52,18,I just wanted to say something more interesting: Wearing masks does not help in stopping the spread of a virus. I would suggest that the president wear his face mask. He's not actually wearing a mask to prevent the spread of the virus.
69,18,> I'm glad to hear that people don't think we should be indoctrinated in a religion.
82,18,My cousin was a member of a group who used to wear a mask. It was to prevent the spread of a virus.
91,18,[Fun fact: in the US a skunk can be treated with a mask. A skunk isn't a skunk. The only difference is that they are skunks.

18,16,"I'm a huge fan of this, and I agree."
23,18,Is that a joke?
43,18,I think the most likely cause is... people on the internet...
50,18,It is a sign for people to learn about the CDC — how they can protect people against the CDC.
52,18,The CDC's not the king of the internet. The CDC is not the king of the internet.
69,18,"I don't see a whole lot of context here. It's about a sexist, rapist - racist, and ineffective government that is making people uncomfortable in public."
82,18,I'm assuming that the mask was invented as a way to prevent the spread of a virus. They're the people to punish. And they're the people to do this. It's their job to help the nutcase.
91,18,So they have some type of legal authority? The EPA and NRA have an issue. It sounds like the government wants to help people in their own country. It also wants the government to stop the spread of a virus. Is it possible that people are trying to reclaim the issue that is just to prevent or treat a virus?
99,18,"I think you can't just say ""oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that"""
101,18,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."

18,12,Is there a whole bunch of context here? Isn't it hilarious how some people like to put on masks to prevent the spread of a virus?
18,13,I'm not sure if it's a cliche but some people are.
18,16,"My boyfriend and I, wearing masks for fun. They're the only ones who've really really made me hate wearing them. I'm a big fan of their stuff, and I can't stand people's views on it."

43,18,"if they did that they could have a lot of good intentions, but don't do that. I know you don't know that people will get shit about it, but it can't help people get HIV/AIDS."
50,18,"AIDS, I think. I don't think you understand what the word ""safety"" means, but it is a phrase for people to learn about the CDC."
52,18,A lot of these comments have been snarky and stupid. What I don't agree with is that the CDC is trying to make people wear their masks to keep viruses from spreading. It's just a joke.
69,18,"That's actually a good one, and I would consider it an example of the same thing."
82,18,What's the purpose of a mask?
91,18,It makes me wonder what's the point of all the people in the US who actually care about the safety of the human race.
99,18,"Isn't it a very funny thing that the government should bring up health issues, which is why they were 'assholes'? What a silly thing to say!"
101,18,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
18,3,"I don't think you understand why they are making a ""snarky"" comment, and you're essentially saying, ""No...I don't want to be the first person to get a vaccine."""
18,8,"It's not about being the first person to get a vaccine, it's about a dick. It's about the other person being a bad person for it. It's not a question of if they are trying to stop the spread of a virus."
18,12,I don't want to get a head wound when I run out of food to get vaccinated.
18,13,"You seem to have an incredible sense of humor. It's not a cliche, it's a myth. It's not a cliche. It's a myth. It is not a myth. It's a fact."
18,16,They are not supposed to stop the spread of a virus.
23,18,"Considering that you're a medic, I think I should start to think of it more as a personal opinion."

91,18,CANNOTANSWER: People in America should get the EPA to get rid of the federal government. They can fire people who don't comply with the regulations and would be fired for violating them.
99,18,"It is a very simple thing to bring up, but I think it needs to be a lot more complex. The CDC is basically being an asshole for calling it a joke. They're not trying to be a joke, they're trying to put it in writing as a joke."

18,8,It's a joke. They are trying to help stop the spread of a virus.A lot of these comments have been snarky and stupid. What I don't agree with is that the CDC is trying to make people wear their masks to keep viruses from spreading.
18,12,Apparently it's not a joke to call it a mask. It's a joke that they want to be made fun of. They don't want to stop the spread of a virus.

It seems like people just don't want to be a joke about it and have no idea what they want."
43,18,"This has been happening for a while. You can see how the government is trying to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS by wearing a mask, but that's just because it's racist."
50,18,"Vaccination is also pretty good for preventing the spread of AIDS. The problem that plagues the people who get HIV/AIDS, and the reason it spreads through their hands, is that it's extremely harmful, and their mouths and hands are reliant on contaminated foods for contamination."
52,18,>The CDC should be able to tell people what to do with this skunk joke.
69,18,"The term ""hammer"" is a bit of a stretch but if you think the CDC will ban vaccines because the government has been saying this in the past, then I bet they will."

91,18,'He is trying to derail the health care system. We're trying to derail it. We are trying to derail the health care system. We're overthinking what a government can do to stop the spread of a virus.

101,18,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
18,3,I'm going to start to put a bunch of hats on myself because of what I can see going on around here. But I can't figure out where to put them.
18,8,"So, you were trying to be funny by trying to say ""Hey! I'm sorry to hear this. I don't like your name but it's a funny one. It was really fun to see your face, but it didn't really get to me."""
18,12,"It's kinda snarky. It's not even a joke, but a legitimate joke."
18,13,There is a lot more to this thread. I've already read the title of a book about wearing a mask and keeping distance.

23,18,"""I don't want to be the first person to get a vaccine, but I do want to get vaccines."""
43,18,That's a good point. You are not going to be happy if the government was pushing for someone else's health care.

52,18,"The author of the article is making a very obvious argument that they can’t prevent the spread of the virus. Apparently, the joke is a joke, not a prank. It’s a prank, and the article makes more sense."
69,18,A friend of mine told me about a viral infection that was spreading on his neighbor's apartment in California. He told me that if he was vaccinated he would wear a mask. The CDC told him not to use the mask.
82,18,It's a crime. Whether or not it is illegal is another matter. The law prohibits skunks from wearing a mask outside or in their car. This is actually against the law. It's against the law.
91,18,a lot of people have said that their opinion on the government is a little extreme and not the majority on their own.
99,18,I don't get that the CDC hasn't done anything afaik with people who haven't gotten vaccinated.
101,18,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
18,3,"It is not only an example of ""snarky,"" but it's a generalization that people will get sick with a virus. I am not saying that is necessarily wrong. If you look at the article it's basically ""you are making a joke to make people feel safer,"" but it doesn't really seem snarky to me. It seems like there are a lot of people who are trying to make the joke snarky."

23,18,"if we have a policy against it, I'm gonna say it's actually a joke, and not a joke."
43,18,"They would have to stop a new skunk from entering the building without their prescription and that would be pretty offensive. That would be a very important thing to prevent, not be the reason the EPA will stop."
50,18,You mean the president has no right to be fired?

69,18,"""I'm glad to hear that people don't think we should be indoctrinated in a religion."""
82,18,"It's a crime to be a skunk. If you don't get a job with the EPA, you can be in the federal prison for a year or two."

23,18,"Then they'll be saying something like ""I know it's a joke, but I don't want to be the first person to get a vaccine, but I do want to get vaccines."""
43,18,I'm not surprised the CDC is still making jokes and talking about people who aren't going to help.
50,18,"Vaccination is a bad thing in the US because it is still illegal in the US, but it is illegal in the US and it isn't a good idea."
52,18,You are going to die for being ignorant. You are going to die because of your ignorance and for a reason.
69,18,Vaccination is a slang term for what I'm sure a lot of people are not aware of.
82,18,"This shit was never that bad for people, it wasn't that bad for a guy."
91,18,It's probably a joke. It's the government who fires people unless they can afford a fucking mask.
99,18,What's wrong with it? It's a joke. But they're being sarcastic.
101,18,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
18,3,It sounds like the CDC is trying to take people's hats' a little too far fetched and overly generalized.
18,8,"Vaccination is a bad thing in the US because it is still illegal in the US, but it isn't a good idea."
18,12,I think you've just gotten some pretty snarky quotes out of a series of comments.
18,13,"It's a cliche. It's a myth. The only time I get it is when I see it in the title and look in a mirror. But if I am not gonna wear a mask, I can't be there for a second. I'm just trying to be there."
18,16,Wearing a mask to hide a viral infection is a terrible way to keep the health of an individual.
23,18,They have a policy against putting a mask on kids and then saying you don't want to be the first person to get a vaccine if you don't want to get a vaccine.
43,18,The whole point of a mask is to stop the spread of a virus.
50,18,"No, it isn't. It's not a joke."
52,18,That was all I've read today.
69,18,"Yes, the term is misleading and doesn't mean anything. I understand why the guy that was trying to make you feel uncomfortable on the internet is trying to sound like a racist, but not sure what his point is."
82,18,"I don't know about the other replies but I do know that it seems to me that in some places, a person may be on a sluggish path if they don't have a criminal license and can be fired for violating a law."
91,18,I think you're right but there are a lot of people in this sub that think this is about the government and what they're trying to do in the US.
99,18,No wonder I didn't realize that the government wasn't the one who was making jokes about the CDC.
101,18,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
18,3,I'm just trying to say I've read some of the comments and they don't sound very snarky.
18,8,Why not try and be as stupid as possible in the comments? You are being an asshole.
18,12,"You don't like the CDC, you don't like being on the news about the government. You haven't said something good, but it's worth a try and remember that this was the first person I had to be honest about vaccinating myself. I just did not understand why people like wearing masks. I don't know why people would do it or how to make fun of the government."
18,13,"The only time I get it is when I see it in the title and look in a mirror. But if I am not gonna wear a mask, I can't be there for a second. I'm just trying to be there."
18,16,"I've been in a lot of situations where I wore a mask for fun but was being forced to wear a mask to help myself. I know some people don't, but I find it to be a way to go."
23,18,I think he thinks that a few things are funny but not the whole point.
43,18,"I'm actually a little skeptical about the issue, but I think that it might be important to discuss that with a CDC expert or a doctor. As a person with a psych therapist, this may not be a good idea for you at all."
50,18,">'Wearing a mask in public places is a good way to keep an infection from spreading and can cause serious health problems.', 'If this is illegal in the US, it can be used to protect people from diseases like AIDS.', ""[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AskReddit_Facts/nafaqcd/nsfaq/gov-nsfaq/nofaqcd/default/influenzas_id_for_sup.'"
52,18,"Then, you know that it's a joke, right?"
69,18,You can't be a racist without the CDC. You cannot be a racist without the CDC. I'm a racist because I am racist because I am a racist because I can't be a racist because I am not a racist because I am not a racist because I am not a racist because I am a racist because I am racist because I am racist because of my religion.
82,18,"""I don't want to wear a mask outside or in my car alone."""
91,18,It's so easy to say you are wrong about the government and the people who are out to take it. It's all the government does and it's the people who do it. It's all the people who are in on the evil and evil thing.
99,18,This guy is putting his mask on in order to make fun of all of his trolls and their friends.
101,18,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
18,3,I think the only snarkiness in this post is that I don't really understand what the CDC's role in this problem is.
18,8,>I think that wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
18,12,>Waring a mask in public places is a good way to keep an infection from spreading and can cause serious health problems.
18,13,"The CDC has a policy against using masks in public places. And in Florida, there are two types of masks. They are called [Dawny Masks](http://www.dawnymask.org/detail/Dawny-Madness-Madness). They're meant to prevent people from developing a virus by preventing them from developing a specific type of AIDS in some cases."
18,16,"I don't know if it's really that funny if you haven't already, but I'm afraid that you're being completely obtuse about a word or two."
23,18,The article cites one possible example of a joke that comes from a joke. It's the actual 'Ask the CDC' article from which the government is promoting a vaccine.
43,18,"I was in one of these recently and the guy that I was talking with said I thought he was doing something wrong. I had to read his post, I was getting the impression it was in reference to a joke because he is being dickish. And I know that is not what the AMA is for but to get an AMA for some people is insane. And he's going to take a med for himself. The government is trying to stop the spread of a virus by erecting the mask and then it becomes a joke? What would it be?"
50,18,"It's a joke, which is a joke, not an actual joke."
52,18,As a former military personnel I can honestly say that I think that this article is pretty much correct and it has just been a bit over the top.
69,18,You're racist because you're racist because you're racist because you're racist because you're racist because you're racist because you're racist because you're racist because you're racist because of your religion.
82,18,It is a crime to wear a mask outside a public place.
91,18,It’s a really sad and shit to think that it is going to get better.
99,18,I'm an advocate for this because the federal government is not the one to make up for the fact that the government has an involuntary role in preventing the spread of viruses.
101,18,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
18,3,I read this when i was a little kid and it really helped.
18,8,>It's a really sad and shit to think that it is going to get better. I’m an advocate for this because the federal government is not the one to make up for the fact that the government has an involuntary role in preventing the spread of viruses.
18,12,"""They don't want to stop the spread of a virus."""
18,13,They're supposed to prevent people from developing a virus by preventing them from developing a specific type of AIDS in some cases.
18,16,And it's a pretty good thing the federal government is not the one to make up for the fact that it's promoting a vaccine.
23,18,"As a former federal employee who was a military contractor, this is the second time in my career I've been to an office, in a state where the military and civilians do not cooperate in the security of the state, and at the time I knew the public would want to have a choice of who to hire."
43,18,"""We don't have to be a jerk, we can't just keep our mouth shut while we wear our masks. That is how the government is erecting these things. We are attempting to combat the spread of HIV/AIDS. They are trying to prevent people from getting HIV/AIDS."""
50,18,"""I think it's a good idea to fire people because of the TAX."
52,18,The article is not about skunks. It's about the Obama Administration's ''abuse of health care''' s efforts to keep the spread of the skunks out of public consciousness.
69,18,There's a lot of undocumented fucking indoctrination going on here.
82,18,I've read the article. It is an interesting read and I've been trying to read it for a while.
91,18,The article does not mention any specific issue. It does mention that the government has no authority to change the health care system.
99,18,Vaccination is not a government requirement. It is a nifty thing to bring up in public about people who have a virus and who are not being vaccinated.
101,18,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
18,3,"I think the question is what the answer is, so I’ll be honest."
18,8,"Vaccination is a bad thing in the US because it is still illegal in the US, but it isn't a good idea."
18,12,I'd be upset if you saw a newspaper article about a black soldier in the midwest stating they'd want a shotgun but they weren't going to let him.
18,13,[This is a comment I've read for a while](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger-Matthews_Jen_Left.pdf).
18,16,"If you are a public servant, I'd recommend that you go and buy a mask if you have one. That's the only reason to have someone take care of you. And that is why I can't imagine spending that kind of money on some one who's not going to take care of you if you're not being a cop, unless you want to see a cop, which is not an option."
23,18,"Unless your wife has been diagnosed with HIV and your husband has a case of HIV, your job description is incorrect and you don't see that as a problem. This sounds very crappy."
43,18,I read a few articles about the government's failure to implement the health care reform.
50,18,"The CDC says that because of this, it will end up costing $600 billion in the long run."
52,18,It is actually true. The article claims that a hat helps to prevent a virus. If you don't like it - go buy a new one - just make a new one.
69,18,"My mom has a friend who is an AMA and is the CDC. They also slammed him for wearing a mask, and have been doing that since the day the first AMA happened."
82,18,"I grew up as a government employee and this was the first thing I knew, as an environmentalist who would tell me that ""I don't want to wear a mask outside or in my car alone is better than going outside alone."" and then the next thing I saw was a skunk being attacked by a skunk, and I'd just throw in the notion that ""if it was the same thing as a skunk, that would be the first thing I did."" and then I started to feel like my life had become more important and more important to me"
91,18,The article is misleading. The EPA and NRA have an issue. It sounds like the government is trying to derail the health care system. They can fire people who don't comply with the regulations and would be fired for violating them. They're also trying to stop the government from being in office as well.
99,18,I have a feeling that the government is just trying to make people more narcissistic.
101,18,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
18,3,'Snarky' is like saying that a lot of people don't really understand how the CDC's role in this problem is. It doesn't really sound as good as it sounds.
18,8,"""You know it's not the same as a skunk,"""
18,12,This is the r/legaladvice.
18,13,I’m not a doctor but if you are going to ask me how I do this I will be on the look out for you and give you some ideas about how to do it.
18,16,I don't understand why you don't want to eat. You eat.
23,18,"In the article: the president hasn't given any evidence that he's been fired, so he's probably gonna end up going to jail and being fired."

52,18,Why not just fucking put the hat in his mouth?
69,18,This is the biggest AMA about a skunk who is trying to make the government look stupid.
82,18,"My skunk cousin actually had a joke when he asked me if I wore a mask in my car for hours and then left with a scar on her throat. I was kind of in a funk until we met, and I thought he said he had an accident while he was out putting the mask on."
91,18,"...and if they can't afford to get rid of the EPA, they're going to have to take care of a lot of other people, and the EPA has to change the healthcare system."
99,18,I think the CDC is just trying to make jokes about it and putting them out there.
101,18,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
18,3,It's basically a joke:
18,8,"My uncle used to wear a mask in school, he would run around the block in the street in the middle of the day. He was one of the best at avoiding all distractions, so I had no problem getting around with him, even after he said ""I have a problem with it, but I need a good mask."" He also had a problem with the lack of a mouth to mouth with a hat on, which he said was just a joke. I threw a hat out for a couple months. I also wanted to get around to"
18,12,"People do it, but it's illegal. They have to take them out."
18,13,The article states that the CDC has an issue and has been trying to derail the healthcare system. They can fire people who don't comply with the regulations and would be fired for violating them.
18,16,A lot of people get sick while wearing masks. And because of this it's a joke that nobody else is supposed to use. This is probably because you are being dragged to a subreddit about this.
23,18,"""In the article: the president hasn't given any evidence that he's been fired, so he's probably going to jail and being fired. I think the joke is just the joke. It seems like a great place to go to the CDC, not the NSA. It's not like the health care system is in a vacuum. If the CDC aren't helping, they have to keep an eye on the players. Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
43,18,I don't understand why the government is making jokes on it. It's just one of the reasons the CDC's attempts to implement it are the ones being made.
50,18,“I think it's a good idea to fire people because of the TAX.'”
52,18,Why is it such a joke? It's just a joke.

82,18,"""It is a crime to be a skunk. If you don't get a job with the EPA, you can be in the federal prison for a year or two."""
91,18,"The article says that the government doesn't have any authority to change the health care system. It claims it can't change the system, but the article does."
99,18,It's also illegal for the government to ask for the protection of the private sector.

18,3,>They can fire people who don't comply with the regulations and would be fired for violating them.

82,18,What does this actually mean? Why would you want to be in prison if you don't get a job?
91,18,"[Peter McConaughey, author of the book, also wrote a book called ""Skittles"" by his daughter, I think you may find useful information here: he had a skunk with a hooded hooded jacket, a long neck, a slender nose, an old toothbrush and some hat."
99,18,The CDC is trying to make it illegal because it’s trying to make it enforceable.
101,18,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
18,3,I have been in prison for a year or two because the CDC is a very powerful agency.

18,12,I just don't understand that I don't know who's gonna get shot at with my mask.
18,13,What's the point in getting rid of the EPA? What's the point of getting rid of the CDC? How can the CIA help you find jobs? What's the point in not giving a fuck about the CDC?
18,16,This is a joke. The government has no power to do anything. They are just a joke.

52,18,It's not the CDC. It's the government. It's a joke. It's a joke.
69,18,So...it's not just a joke. It's a part of their policy.
82,18,"if skunks don't get a job with a public agency, you're a criminal. If you're a cop, you're a criminal. If you wear a mask outside a public agency, you're a criminal."

18,8,"The article clearly says that wearing a mask to stop the spread of a virus, that the president wears a mask to prevent the spread of a virus."
18,12,I don't think it's funny that someone's making fun of a joke about the government - they say you aren't racist - just that a joke isn't funny and this is a bad joke.
18,13,"I'm not a doctor, but I am a doctor. I am sure that a skunk is a good idea, but it's a ridiculous one."
18,16,"Vaccination is a joke. Then he says he is a racist because he believes that people who want to be racist should know what he's talking about, and that the president can't afford to spend money to protect others."
23,18,"The president is wearing a mask, despite the fact that the public is 'infected', while some people are 'infected' by the virus, and have been at a lot of events with it on. Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of a virus. The government is a parasite. The government is a parasite. The government is a parasite. The government isn't mandated to wear a mask."

69,18,Vaccination is not a joke. The CDC is not responsible for stopping and stopping the spread of the virus. It is one of those jokes that is funny to me.
82,18,"In some places, a person may be on a sluggish path if they don't have a criminal license and can be fired for violating a law. Is that a crime? I am not sure, but he is correct. That's not how a crime is defined. He could be in prison for a year or two for wearing a mask in public. He is going to be charged with treason and battery for wearing a mask outside while out at night."
91,18,I've had a few clients who said that they would read this. One of them was a patient and was treated in a medical clinic by a steward. One of them told me there were several other questions that would be answered in the AMA but I couldn't find the answer for them. The skunk is also a disease which means that the doctor tries to keep the patient safe. The doctor also said there is a lack of reassurance from his doctor that he will not get a chance in the future.

They are trying to prevent the spread of a virus.

23,18,The CDC and the CIA are the one who are trying to sway the conversation. I think this is pretty good to us for asking people what they should do - I can't imagine the president taking on this kind of attitude from someone who is more concerned about his health than his safety (and what his own health is in the public eye).
43,18,It's pretty much the same situation with the ACA: people who wear a mask can't get healthy without a prescription. People who wear masks can get sick without a prescription if they have some sort of bacterial infection - and it's also like people who don't have a doctor who knows everything about a virus.

18,13,"No. The article says ""What if someone has to do this for a reason, they have a right to be a scumbag"" (sic) and it sounds like a joke that people should do because of a valid reason."
18,16,I think that your post... is more interesting because it's a joke and the CDC doesn't have any authority to do anything.
23,18,"The article does say ""that's a joke"", but it doesn't say that it is a joke."
43,18,"'We don't have to be a jerk, we can't just keep our mouth shut while we wear our masks. That is how the government is erecting these things. We are attempting to stop the spread of a virus.'"
50,18,Vaccination is a joke. It’s a joke because the government has a duty to protect people from disease.
52,18,The article says the doctor isn't responsible for the health care system. The CDC tries to force people to wear a mask to stop the spread of the virus. The article is an article about a skunk whose job it's to protect the public. That's a joke. The article doesn't mention the fact that it's a joke.
69,18,Vaccination is a joke and the CDC is just using it to make people uncomfortable in their own country because they're the only group who actually have a legitimate reason to not use it in that situation.

91,18,I think a lot of the skunks in this sub aren't aware of what's going on. They aren't aware of what's going on. Is there a difference between a skunk wearing a mask and a skunk wearing a mask?
99,18,I'm a little confused with the title.

18,13,The first one is quite the joke to me.

52,18,Why not tell the CDC that they should change it so people won't have to go through with the whole thing because of the hat? Is that the joke or a joke?

23,18,I do not think you have the right to say this is a joke.
43,18,"The article doesn't cite any specifics. The person was pointing out that the person wearing a mask is a jerk. It wasn't to stop people getting sick and would be a joke. ""The whole thing seems a little sexist, but I don't think it's."""
50,18,It's not a joke because it is a joke. It's a joke because it is a joke about a government acting in bad faith.
52,18,"“It seems that the one-handed government policy that is implementing in the US is to allow people in the military to wear their masks. In general, if they are the first ones to have a hooded shirt or pants on they are considered to be a bit risky. The ACA and the healthcare system have nothing to do with the ACA."
69,18,Vaccination is a sexist system. It's a sexist system. It's a joke. But a joke is a joke. This isn't a 'political campaign'. This is the'real'question.

91,18,"It's not just the government. It's the federal government. You want to know what the point of the article is, and then 'obviously, it makes it more clear'"
99,18,The title is misleading. But the article is about the government. Vaccination is a legitimate medical necessity and I would not be going anywhere with that because it is not the way to get vaccinated. The title was a joke.
101,18,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
18,3,"I think that it’s just a joke. The idea of the article is so confusing that I can’t see it as much as the original comment, but as I see it a lot more people could read the article, and you’re not being sarcastic."
18,8,"In this context it seems like the only way to stop the spread of viruses in the U.S. is if you're wearing masks, like you are wearing a hat."
18,12,"I'm going to go with you because I'm a doctor and I'm going to be a doctor."""
18,13,I cant believe the guy is telling you what to do. He's gonna be in jail for a year or two if he doesn't have the money to do so. It's a joke.

18,13,Nope a joke. It is the only way to stop a virus that isn't in the U.S.
18,16,The problem is that the CDC is trying to make up for the government promoting the vaccine and the CDC has a tendency to make up for it. They are trying to stop the spread of a virus.
23,18,I don't like it because I don't want to read it. I'm afraid it will get thrown around in the background.
