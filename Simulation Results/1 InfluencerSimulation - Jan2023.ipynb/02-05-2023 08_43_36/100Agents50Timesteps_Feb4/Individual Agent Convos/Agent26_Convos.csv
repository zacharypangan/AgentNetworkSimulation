76,26,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. Yes, it is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
78,26,I think we should stop wearing masks in public.
83,26,You're a really bad man and I don't want to be associated with the president.

26,8,"There's a lot of stuff on the Internet that is tipped over into a troll account, if it's anything like this one, it's probably worth reading the comments and not going on the internet to find it."
45,26,>I'm actually a coach and I wear a mask at every single event. I want to wear the mask to protect the players from a virus or an infection but not to prevent it from spreading. But I'm trying to explain what the role of masks are in protecting the players because I think it is a good idea to get it in public and help prevent a virus or disease.
70,26,"OP. Are you a fan of the guy who wears a mask? I have never met a guy who wears it. If anyone will say that in a letter to president trump there will be a massive firestorm where the teams need to take a helmet off for safety. The answer is no. Until then, if you want order in America trump must take off his mask and turn himself in. That's fucking stupid. I'm not a fan of that part of the meme."
75,26,I'm a guy with a mask.
76,26,"I'm not a big fan of this, but I understand that people want to put their own masks on their bodies, and I don't think it's worth it to put them on if they don't have the virus."
78,26,>I'm surprised that the only reason for those who didn't vote against the ACA were people who didn't vote for the one that was in a community of people who support their choice.

45,26,"In order for people to get sick, they must wear a mask. In this context, he should wear a mask outside or in his car, where a doctor is on duty for a day. He should always put one on the driver's seat so the doctor can see the person. I've never been to a game where I had to wear a mask and I actually didn't."
70,26,I feel that this post is in the wrong direction and I'm not sure what you are trying to tell me. What you were trying to say is kind of a nod to the fact that the article is implying that Trump has a mask.
75,26,You're probably getting this wrong because it's a satire and a movie
76,26,So I have to go and get tested on this.
78,26,if he had the courage to put a mask on the neck he'd be able to save his life. that would be great.
83,26,Nope. Just do it.
90,26,It is not a skunk wearing mask. This is a public health measure. It would be a pretty bad idea to wear a mask when there is an outbreak of the flu in a local school.
91,26,"A lot of people are getting sick from having to wear masks in public. It's like saying ""I'm so sick, I'm a bit of a bad guy and I have to wear a mask to stay safe."""

90,26,"It is a public health measure. It would be a pretty bad idea to wear a mask when there is an outbreak of the flu in a local school. It is the best thing to do and will be the only thing to do, regardless of whether it is to prevent the spread of a virus."
91,26,Exactly. The issue is a lot of people are arguing the validity of wearing a mask.
94,26,I don't see how that could be done. People are supposed to think that these masks stop the spread of any type of illness and stop the spread of a virus.
26,8,"I can't imagine a coach with a mask in public, but as long as they don't have the flu and have it in their neck (it's possible the virus can spread), I doubt the flu is a problem with them."

76,26,It's very unclear. 'No' is a valid question. A person who has the virus who is a non-medical worker will be the first person to have the virus.

76,26,I don't think there's any chance it's a petty joke. There's nothing to be concerned about.
78,26,"There is nothing in the ACA that would stop you from getting a mask. Having a helmet for your children in your workplace makes it more likely that someone will get the rash out. Besides, you know people who don't get to go to public school, so the only way to get your child into school is to avoid their school. Getting a mask on your head isn't that much of an issue, it's just a way of recognizing when you've got a mask on to get it off before you've started to have one."
83,26,"In my experience, when a person has HIV, they will have to get their vaccine. If they have to get the vaccine, they aren't going to be able to stop them from spreading the virus. This is also an issue with having the public gov't be the healthiest country in the world. This is really ridiculous. And it is."
90,26,"The article mentions that the school voted against it. They could have voted against it for safety reasons. It's also interesting that the ACA is in place, but I am in the US as well."
91,26,[The article goes on to state that the EPA and NRA have no authority to change the health care system.... But that's probably why it's a big problem.

70,26,I think you're right about the 'Mask me a shit and my name' part.
75,26,I've been in an EPA based health care program and it doesn't seem like it's being done. It's not like there's a federal mandate to protect anyone unless they're pregnant.
