82,4,if you wear a mask outside or in your car alone your gullible and submissive not traits you want to project
99,4,oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that
8,4,"i wear a mask in public everyday and you can see it in public everyday and that is pretty cool to me. but the way they use it means you should be able to see it in public even if you don't want to go, because you are a virican and it doesn't have the same effect on people."
9,4,If you wear a mask you help to stop the spread of a virus.
14,4,[NAME] is a scientist and a politician. They're also in a medical team that makes a team called the nfl.
22,4,"Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of a virus, it's useless and I hate it."
25,4,oh i agree with your first comment... i'm wearing a mask in the hospital for a fever or flu. i've never had a flu. i was doing the same thing with my friend when i was in a hospital and i saw a scream from the crowd. it hurts. i don't know why the guy can't wear a mask at work and the guy can't get a job with no insurance or it is very uncomfortable.
27,4,It seems that santa is wearing a mask to protect himself.
31,4,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.please mask up and maintain social distance people please mask up and maintain social distance people how does the mask make his breath come out of the back of his head
47,4,IANAL but I am a big fan of those masks.
49,4,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
57,4,That's how I know it's not actually a true problem.
59,4,And then... i say 'I just got my mask'
60,4,What does wearing a mask with a mask have to do with the illness?

8,4,Nope nope. The government was bringing about the problem.
9,4,You wear a mask? I wore one last year but nobody liked it at all. I don't understand why anyone would wear one when you're in a hurry to get into that kind of situation.
14,4,That's what he said...
22,4,"I'm sorry, I'm not being a Democrat."
25,4,"I read the article: ""The CDC is implementing measures to stop the spread of viruses in hospitals. Says the woman that wears the mask to protect herself lmao well dear the gun works the mask doesn't see this is how crazy trump s made the united states of america """
27,4,The government can't do it unless they know.
31,4,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.how does the mask make his breath come out of the back of his head
47,4,"I don't even know what you mean by that. I thought it was interesting that they did mandated vaccination in 2006, but I'm sure this will happen in the near future."
49,4,"We can't let those who don't know the truth go to the local medical school in the state we live in. Besides, it's illegal to take off your mask when you need to go to the medical school to get vaccinated and get boosters."
57,4,Why does this make me a man of my word? I like to be able to tell what I want from people.
59,4,"As someone who has never been to Twitchcon, I'd have to say I'm not a fan of them, unless you don't like the ""whipped"" parts."
60,4,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
61,4,"I don't care for people like you either. You will probably feel worse if you do, but I'm saying the government is trying to get people to come up with some policies that, for the sake of the American people, aren't allowing it."
82,4,"Using the word 'facial' and the word'sensitive' to refer to the same thing as 'weaving a mask'. I'm not sure what is the correct one. Usually my first experience with a mask is if my boobs were in their mouth, I'd just feel as if they were in a mask. But this one's my favorite. I'd have to change my hair so that the boobs could get out of my face."
99,4,"I'm a guy in high school. He was in a mask and I was a big fan of it but I didn't really like wearing it. He has been having trouble breathing since but no one wants to talk about that. I am not a big fan of the word that Maroon, that's a shit thing. I'm a big fan of the stuff that is so obscure."
8,4,I don't believe the government wants to prevent you from dying from a virus.
9,4,I think a bit of the humor comes from the fact that people on this sub are more likely to use the phrase 'protect other people he only cares about himself' if there's no 'you wear a mask' instead of 'you're wearing one'.
14,4,"I would probably think that if they were able to use the same thing as they do without a mask, it would only take one of the other two to wear it properly."
22,4,This is not a joke.
25,4,"That's a funny thing to read here, but what does it say?"
27,4,i'm really sorry. you are too young to realize that a man can wear a mask every day and still get sick. and that's an excuse to wear it.
31,4,"I think it is a good idea to make a fucking noise that the government has a responsibility to stop, not just keep a mask on."
47,4,"I don't know the exact title, but I am not a big fan of those masks."
49,4,"Whenever we have a problem with a government mandated vaccine, we make a video that says it's part of the system to prevent it from spread. I don't think a person in a state that has a virus can change. We have an order for the health department to tell their commissioners what to do to prevent this. We don't want to go on and on about the government's handling of the situation. So I don't think the problem isn't that he's wrong about putting it on someone else's face, but that"
57,4,"Because you think the government is the one that has the power to stop the spread of a virus? I think it is something that is really important to the people to consider, so he has a responsibility to fend for himself."
59,4,i thought the worst part of this was that people would always have the problem of not wearing a mask and that is why i think the most important thing to do is just put on a mask.
60,4,I don't understand why people aren't aware that wearing a mask is not to reduce the spread of the virus.
61,4,"I don't know much about the subject, but they're getting a lot of media attention for their ""twitchcon"" stuff. It's the one event they're talking about."
82,4,Then you'd have to change your hair so that the boobs could get out of your face.
99,4,I read a lot of hacked comments like this. I don't see why they would care about any issues other than just the physicality of the topic.
8,4,"Because the government has no authority over anything, and has nothing to do with this."
9,4,I am going to make a list to go through on my next vacation.
14,4,"They can't, but they can."
22,4,"There is a lot of information pertaining to this in your post, including the fact that the government was actively trying to prevent the spread of the virus, which is not a joke at all."
25,4,Why don't you wear a mask at work? Does a person just walk into a hospital without a mask?
27,4,You can never wear a mask at a party with a shirt and then a hat.
31,4,... Is it a rule? I can't believe that some of it isn't really about making a good noise. I have an incredibly loud case of saying that the only way to stop a virus is to put a shield on all the people that want to try to prevent it.
47,4,It's really funny that Donald J. Trump went to college with his wife. I think he's a big fan of the government.
49,4,"Having seen the article you're responding to is just a snide way of saying you're going to have to wait, and then say something else. I am a londono and i am going to be a twat and i hate this guy."
57,4,The government has a power to stop the spread of a virus. That means that the people responsible for its spread are likely to be given more power in their own right to make that choice.
59,4,I'm glad people don't wear masks anymore in my state.
60,4,> I wouldn't wear a mask if it weren't for the virus and it's just a joke. It's just a joke.
61,4,Vaccination is a crime and your parents should not have to deal with it.
82,4,"The ""Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."""
99,4,The CDC has stated that a lot of people in the US are allergic to HIV.
8,4,I can see this problem in several different places:
9,4,"I don't think you understand why people would wear a mask in an emergency, but in order to do so, you need to be willing to work up the courage to be honest with people."
14,4,"This is not a great joke, and is not a good enough reason for you to disagree."
22,4,"""""Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of a virus, it's useless and I hate it."""""
25,4,I think you're being really rude and stupid about it.
27,4,Is this the same for other things?
31,4,The US policing has a reputation for being sexist and the government is a parasite. The government is a parasite. The only thing they can do about it is have a scumbag face mask and not get in contact with a real virus.
47,4,People who don't want to get vaccinated don't care. Vaccines are not a great idea.
49,4,"In my state, that would be a twat."
57,4,"Are you a school counselor? If so, then you need to be in the school and get a face mask, so you're not putting a mask on your mom."
59,4,Is the issue with the mask in your city really that difficult to work out? Is it is my responsibility to do my own thing.
60,4,"A woman in my high school told me that she had the virus and was going to wear it every week. I was horrified by it and he was horrified at the same time and then was like, wow, this is a horrible joke. I don't know how I can stop the spread of the virus or how this can get over if people wear it. But the fact that she was wearing it and they were sick and her face was pretty freaking weird."
61,4,"Is the government trying to convince you that if you don't mind, then you shouldn't be allowed to wear a mask. ''We are just there to protect the people. We want to do something about it, not just make sure the government isn't using it. Are you aware that the government is invading an entire nation?"
82,4,">As an American who is in the US, I think that you're a bit dumb about how you are actually a gullible and submissive woman."
99,4,Because we are not immune to HIV.
8,4,It sounds like a bit of a racial slur.
9,4,"I think a bit of the humor comes from the fact that people on this sub are more likely to use the phrase 'protect other people he only cares about himself' if there's no 'you wear a mask' instead of 'you're wearing one'.""."
14,4,"So it's not a good joke at all? The real question is, how can we wear a mask and not have to pay for a public hospital?"
22,4,I'm not a feminist but I love the concept of people getting their own masks. I love wearing my own masks.
25,4,Why don't you wear a mask at work?
27,4,"That is a very very simple and simple question to ask the same question to people you are in contact with. The only reason we have this is that people have different reactions to things, whether they're tainted by an EPA employee or a government agency."
31,4,I'm afraid a lot of people don't really understand that this is what it's being used for.
47,4,Vaccines are not a great idea. The only thing that really seems to work in this thread is how we make things a little easier and less dangerous. And why wouldn't we be doing the same thing?
49,4,"So, if the article argues that the EPA is ""not willing to admit that their behavior is wrong or a good thing,"" then the problem is that the EPA is using the word ""fake"" in a way that might be unprofessional."
57,4,CANNOTANSWER: Vaccination is not required for everyone unless the person is in an advanced stage of a clinical trial. Isn't that why the state has mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters? Because it makes people less prone to contract and vaccinating.
59,4,"I just want to say... that if people were to ask what ""I want to be in a medical emergency and wear a mask,"" then I'd be on a roll right now, so I'd be able to say I'm not in a serious condition yet."
60,4,> You mean to put on a mask? You can do whatever you want a mask for. Vaccination is not mandatory for everyone unless the person is in an advanced stage of a clinical trial.
61,4,">The act of vaccination is inconvenient and is a major part of it. It's one of the few times the government is being able to make something of it, but that's not a problem at all."
82,4,"'Wearing a mask outside, but not in a car, isn't a crime.'"
99,4,That isn't a joke.
8,4,"I mean, as a conservative, I don't think anything of a joke could possibly be any better than a dick saying something like this."
9,4,>Is there anything you can do to support the ACA and the ACA itself?
14,4,"I think that in a way, it's better than not wearing a mask."
22,4,A big problem for the government is that they are being actively trying to protect people.
25,4,">I love the look of a mask and the smell of one TWitchCon and DC’s, because you can’t afford to attend the event."
27,4,Vaccination is not required for everyone unless the person is in an advanced stage of a clinical trial. Isn't that why the state has mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters? Because it makes people less prone to contract and vaccinating. They're the people to punish. And they're the people to do this. It sounds like the EPA and NRA have an issue to start with.
31,4,Isn't it the problem that you don't understand what'sad' is?
47,4,I think we're already doing the same.
49,4,"If there aren't enough people in the US, you're not on the right track. The government is not on the right track, and in fact I would assume that the situation is inherently racist. It would be nice to hear this sort of thing, but I don't have a bad feeling."
57,4,I want a mask and I need a helmet and mask.
59,4,I don't have a problem with a lot of schools being in this situation.
60,4,Why is the president willing to do it because it is not a crime to use a mask?
61,4,You've got to go back and read the article.
82,4,We're not supposed to wear a mask in the car.
99,4,I agree with the others. The only thing that is missing is that this message has been around for years. I know the CDC is going to have to change it.
8,4,"Vaccination is a very different kind of health issue than the vaccines you can wear in your city and not your state. This is why they need to take measures to prevent the spread of the virus, even when it's not a real problem. I would suggest going with a doctor who hasn't seen a skunk in awhile, but is sure to go with that."
9,4,"No. The ACA is designed to prevent the spread of a virus. It's the same as the government that will be able to put a medical device on everyone without them or warning that people will have a virus. There's actually a very interesting piece by the author, and I like it very much. I'm wondering if the person 'wearing a mask' is a joke, or something else. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
14,4,"You're making a pretty good point, and I can't wait to see that npc, [http://www.acnn.org/article/distance-of-virus-senior-virus-senior-virus](http://www.acnn.org/article/distance-of-virus-senior-virus) reads to me, and it is really really funny."
22,4,"It's all good, you don't have to go around getting all sexy and sexy, and then they're like ""Oooooh you're an idiot"". That being said, the idea of people wanting their own masks is a bad idea, and it's not just that people who can't afford to be sexy and sexy can't afford to have their own masks."
25,4,I don’t think there is anything wrong with wearing a mask. I think that’s why the EPA has been so aggressive in their lawsuits.
27,4,'Phoenix'.
31,4,"It is not a joke that people would take it for granted because of it being so obvious. But if you are not familiar with the law, you can tell people if they believe it is a joke."
47,4,I was just trying to make sure someone was aware of the CDC's methods and recommendations for the prevention of HIV/AIDS.
49,4,I agree that they're not doing anything wrong based on what we have learned from the article. The fact that you have to wait to go see the doctor when you need to get vaccines is a bit twat to me.
57,4,"I don't think the current administration is being sexist at all, so I guess it's only a minor matter."
59,4,"It's like if a virus spreads to all the people who are going to be wearing it, then there are many, many people who are going to get it as a medical emergency."
60,4,You are just an idiot and you shouldn't wear the mask if you don't like it.
61,4,> Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
82,4,Nope. It's a joke.
99,4,The article states the public has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that.
8,4,In the AMA [here is a link to a few of my comments.](https://www.r/advice.htm).
9,4,That is what a mask is. The ACA is a joke. Until we change the laws and make people care for their own health. It is not a joke or just a joke.
14,4,There are tons of places that are doing it.
22,4,"In this case, it's not a joke. It's just a joke. It's not even a joke that the government is actually trying to prevent the spread of the virus. It's just a joke."
25,4,">I don’t think it’s illegal for someone who doesn’t know what a mask is called, to wear it at an event. I’m not sure what the actual reason is for this."
27,4,"It's a joke, but it's not something you like, like a joke. There is nothing else to laugh at and that's okay."
31,4,"[Right this side: You should stop being funny because you're not a joke. I mean, I'm a fan of the government.."
47,4,>People who don't want to get vaccinated don't care. Vaccines are not really a great idea.
49,4,"The guy I hated in the interview is the guy from the TV show “The Truth, “ about how the President is a joke that is on display. I like the hat idea because I like it, but that doesn’t mean it’s useful.” He gets no response."
57,4,Vaccination is not required for everyone unless the person is in an advanced stage of a clinical trial.
59,4,I think the biggest problem with that is the lack of evidence proving that the mask is not contagious.
60,4,The movie I was watching about it was a joke from someone at the school who's mother was an infected dickhead. I was horrified and a bit disgusted. Especially since she had an infection in the face and it was so bad she wouldn't wear the mask.
61,4,It doesn't even have to be illegal to wear a mask outside of a vehicle. It just has to be a policy.
82,4,The government is putting more resources into helping people and not inflicting such abuse on a community.
99,4,You're right about the CDC being a joke. It's not just the people who are trying to get the flu out of their country but the people who actually have an attitude that has been a joke.
8,4,Then the article says that the EPA and NRA have no authority to change the health care system.... But that's probably why it's a big problem. There's a lot of talking about people being able to have their head removed.
9,4,The ACA is designed to help stop the spread of the disease.
14,4,This is why we should not just wear a skunk mask. We do not have a mask that can stop the spread of a virus.
22,4,"I'd rather the government pranks them. I know people who wear them, and I know that's how I feel about it. I can say that I think it's funny but not a joke. I am not sure I can say 'I love the concept of people getting their own masks'. I want my own team."
25,4,Aaaaand I'm not sure what the facts were that the CDC wasn't using any sexist language.
27,4,"I just got a mask in a party, but I didn't want to wear it. I did want to wear it anyway, and I've done it in other ways too."
31,4,The op is an idiot.
47,4,"I'm a big fan of this one, but I don't think I've seen it in a long time."
49,4,"We love our nation and we love you, and the truth of this, and we love your country."
57,4,The title is a joke.
59,4,No. We're talking about the same thing. And then we put on a mask.
60,4,"""Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
61,4,I was in the CDC for 10 years and we had a lot of great problems.
82,4,Is it a crime to wear a mask in the car? Because that is not how they are supposed to get away with a virus in the car.
99,4,"""Is it really the CDC or the CDC that can be blamed for these things and keep them on the side of the people"""
8,4,Because we're the ones that are responsible for the EPA and NRA. It's not just a troll.
9,4,I don't know why people wear a mask. I think people wear masks because they look like they're going to do the same to others in the future.
14,4,"[http://www.thefcp.gov/hs/en/htc/en/sp/deployments/hpdcfi) has a video in which the government is infiltrating the government, while allowing the government to ""enact"" a vaccine that has already passed the federal mandate."
22,4,Vaccines aren't just about preventable diseases. They aren't just about preventable diseases. The CDC isn't in the hsid. It is the federal government's responsibility. They aren't 'allowed' by the government to do anything. They aren't 'allowed' by the government to do anything.
25,4,"> ""They don't even use a word that implies it's a sexist tactic. They say it's useless and I hate it."""
27,4,Y'know what I was thinking.
31,4,"If you wear a mask in public health emergencies, you get sick, and the risk of getting sick increases. It's only a joke if the government has a good reason for stopping the spread of a virus."
47,4,"A bunch of people that I know from a college of mine don't get vaccinated, but they're just saying they don't want to be vaccinated at all. They're basically saying the US government doesn't want to vaccinate people. This is a whole new kind of joke."
49,4,You have no idea who said that.
57,4,"This subreddit - this subreddit - is incredibly unfunny. You know the kind of comments people get all the time. I mean, you have to admit that you're a petty troll. But don't let yourself be the one who makes all these comments. You gotta have a laugh and let me guess."
59,4,"""I feel like the only good thing about a mask is that it makes a lot of people uncomfortable in their room, so it becomes like the ol''fucking shit.''"
60,4,I figured it was really a joke.
61,4,Vaccination is a crime and your parents should not have to deal with it. I think people are joking about the fact that the US government is a pretty terrible place to live.
82,4,You know that if someone is really into the skunk problem and the government thinks that they are in an ethical relationship then I wouldn't consider it a crime to do it.
99,4,"My dad and I have been vaccinated for many years, and when we first got the vaccine we had a little skunk in the side and started thinking about the stigma of being the first to die from a nasty infection."
8,4,You can’t change something that makes you uncomfortable or uncomfortable. You can change it.
9,4,"People wear masks and don't realize how effective they are. People do. And because they wear the masks they're infected and the virus doesn't spread. That's not a joke, it's a joke."
14,4,"You're talking about how a CDC member said the ""masked people are getting more aggressive to keep spreading a virus"" which in turn will be defunded by the gov. and the cdc. The CDC are doing the same thing and want people to stop wearing it."
22,4,You gotta take care of your body. That's a real thing.
25,4,I am not the one that writes any sort of AMA on skunks.
27,4,"The government is being an asshole because they are not putting health care on the people, and that doesn't mean they are not willing to do it."
31,4,"It's not a joke. It's a joke. You don't understand the message of the joke, or the purpose of the joke, it's to help keep the population safe, or to stop the spread of a virus."
47,4,"It's not a joke at all. You are the one who has no intention of getting any sort of vaccine for themselves, and no one will want to get vaccinated."
49,4,"I feel like a lot of people would say things like, ""Oh, the guy isn't racist, he is racist."""
57,4,"Vaccination is a little too obvious. In most countries, it's not necessary."
59,4,The skunks here are not in Texas.
60,4,I think it's a good idea to wear a mask when you can't leave office.
61,4,"Why does it have to be illegal to wear a mask? Because you can't, because I'm sure they can get you to stop wearing a mask, unless you are the first one in your family to get into a major infection."
82,4,"I'm not an expert, but the article is a bit misleading, because it states that the EPA doesn't have a criminal license. They're violating laws by restricting the use of a car or on the highway without permission from an owner. So I believe that the rule is incorrect."
99,4,"The CDC, as well as many other charities have put it, is taking too much money from the world to implement a vaccination program."
8,4,They need to find a way to stop the spread of the virus.
9,4,"It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. The government doesn't care about protecting the public. They are just skunks. The fact that it's a joke that everyone seems to be saying ""I feel bad for my parents who would wear a mask to prevent the spread of a virus."" Those who don't know the actual name of the doctor are saying ""I'm always confused by it. CDC uses that word for preventing the spread of vaccines."
14,4,I've been on the receiving end of a lot of bad jokes. So much so that people are comparing people to the guy that told it.
22,4,"Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of a virus, it's useless and I hate it."
25,4,I've heard a lot of people complain about skunks in their AMAs.
27,4,There's a good reason it's not an unconstitutional thing for you to wear a mask. Then you'll find out that it's illegal in most countries. Vaccination isn't really illegal in most countries because it seems like the CDC is trying to do it in order to make the government look stupid.
31,4,The article was full of examples.
47,4,I think it's kind of funny that the president is giving out free vaccines to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.It's actually kind of funny that the president is giving out free vaccines and then the CDC can get on that and not do anything about it.
49,4,I'm sure the first time I saw the movie was when I was trying to work out what to do next. I didn't even realize the article wasn't about a government mandated vaccine. And then I figured they were going to do something for the money. I didn't know it was just a joke.
57,4,"I think you're misunderstanding the meaning of the word ""revisiting"" and being rude. The answer to this is:"
59,4,I don't know what I know about a lot of the stuff.
60,4,"'Asshole', a joke?"
61,4,"> I'm not a doctor. The NRA is being sabotaged by the government. They aren't a government agency. I'm a vaccinated person with boosters. I wear a mask every day for the rest of my life. I get sick everyday. I get sick every day. Vaccination is a crime and your parents shouldn't have to deal with it. I don't like the idea of people being ""pooped"" for some reasons. I don't even have to be a policy."
82,4,I do not want to read the entire article in all of its dozens of variations.
99,4,Vaccination is a part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. It's a joke for the government to bring up health problems.
8,4,The article is pretty blatantly obtuse and ridiculous. And it does not say the government has any authority to change the health care system and is a doppelganger of the president.
9,4,">I see that you are not racist, you are racist. You have no point in saying that a mask will stop any fucking disease."
14,4,"It's also a joke that there is a ""masked"" version of the joke that the CDC is working on."
22,4,Vaccines aren't a thing. They aren't just about preventable diseases. They aren't just about preventable diseases. The CDC isn't in the HHSID. It is the federal government's responsibility.
25,4,There are not a lot of people out there who can't get a job with no insurance.
27,4,I resigned from the NRA. I was in my late twenties and got some basic medical training as a student. This is a joke to the person I am. They are supposed to prevent people from being vaccinated. But there's a problem with them doing it in order to look stupid.
31,4,"This is a joke. It's not a joke, but it's a joke."
47,4,"> I think it's kind of funny that the president is giving out free vaccines to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.The whole ""How do the people being infected do not make them sick? They just want to keep them alive."" thing is actually very interesting I think it's kind of funny that the president is giving out free vaccines to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
49,4,"""I want a mask that I can wear to my parents because I know that I can't get vaccines while my kids are out and I'm not able to do it when I am alone. I don't really understand how a man would be if he didn't wear a mask for HIV. It’s a joke. I’m just going to put some weight on a joke that doesn’t matter and that’s probably all the reason that the White House is there, even if he’s in the White House"
57,4,Vaccination is not required for everyone unless the person is in an advanced stage of a clinical trial.
59,4,It's been a long time since I've been able to find a r/raisedbytrump
60,4,>I've always loved the idea of the government using their power to protect the people who are sick.
61,4,I’m afraid you would get sick in a lot of places. Infected people like me will do whatever they want.
82,4,It says that wearing a mask outside is not a crime. It says that it is a crime to smoke if you do it in public without your permission.
99,4,"So, I read your piece a while back in high school and was joking to my wife about a girl who was getting vaccinated for the flu for 2 days. I couldn't believe I thought the government would do that. I couldn't even begin to think of a joke. I think the government tries to make the jokes more popular. 'The only way to get a virus is to be vaccinated. It's not required by the government. I am a doctor, and I can't think of an answer to that."
8,4,"The article said, ""But that's probably why it's a big problem."
9,4,What do you think the joke is? It is a joke that the ACA is designed to prevent the spread of a virus.
14,4,"> ""I wish you the best and may hope you get some healthy skin... Is it OK to be a good guy and help the poor?"""
22,4,I would like to call the NRA a terrorist organization.
25,4,This isn't the first time that you've been on the front page. That's not why you have been on it.
27,4,Isn't it a great joke? You're a great doctor and a good candidate. Are you a good lawyer or a politician? Is the NRA a terrorist group? Isn't it a great idea - I'm sure they are!
31,4,"The CDC has a reputation for being sexist and a parasite. The government is a parasite. The government is a parasite. The only thing they can do about it is have a shield on all the people that want to try to prevent it."""
47,4,I’m going to start a series of people’s faces when it comes to Vaccines vs AIDS.
49,4,>I am a nut case.
57,4,"A lot of the jokes I've heard on here seem to involve the government's role in the prevention of the spread of a virus, but not the public's."
59,4,"I'm not going to put it in your comments, but I'll leave it as if I had to say that you guys should not be on reddit."
60,4,This is what's in the article.
61,4,I'm a little confused by the last part.
82,4,I would fire people for wearing a mask outside.
99,4,Vaccination isn't a joke. It's a joke.
8,4,"The only thing that makes sense is people who've not been vaccined are not the ones that don't vaccinate, and even that's why the government is a joke."
9,4,"The ACA isn't a joke, it's just a joke."
14,4,"[I'm a lawyer. I am not a lawyer. I am a lawyer.](http://www.thefcp.gov/hs/en/htc/en/sp/deployments/hpdcfi) has a video in which the government is infiltrating the government, while allowing the government to ""enact"" a vaccine that has already passed the federal mandate."
22,4,"I am a doctor and I use to go to the doctor but not often enough to get one. I love it and I am so glad that I do. I am the only sane person in the world, and there isn't even a single person in the world who wears a mask and I can't afford it."
25,4,"It is a very simple, sexist thing to read, but also a really easy, and pretty reasonable thing to read. I have seen some very funny people write AMAs on skunks, so that is my interpretation."
27,4,People are 'not going to want to wear masks' - because that's how many people in the U.S. are actually allowed to wear them in public places with no one being able to see them.
31,4,I'm very familiar with the laws governing it and this particular piece is very informative. I can't help but think that it's a joke. The fact that people are joking about the vaccines doesn't make it any less of a joke than the fact that the NRA is an anti-virus group.
47,4,I would like to ask how the NRA got rid of the mask. I think the first line is:
49,4,"'You've only seen the movie, and the smear campaign?'"
57,4,>You are not a sexist. You are not a woman. You are not a woman. You are not a woman. You are not a woman.
59,4,Vaccination is a big deal. This is why the FDA is blocking people from vaccinating themselves.
60,4,I don't see how that was a joke about the CDC or any health authority. I know you're a doctor but this is a legitimate joke.
61,4,It's a prank. This isn't the government.
82,4,The issue of the skunk is the masks and the government. They don't make it illegal.
99,4,Vaccination is illegal in my state because it's not mandatory.
8,4,Then the article says that the EPA and NRA have no authority to change the health care system.
9,4,The ACA is designed to prevent the spread of a virus. It's designed to stop the spread of a virus. There are actually a few people here who have genuinely a question about the ACA.
14,4,The AMA is about the dangers of wearing a mask that could lead to deaths. You can not tell people what it is that will affect you and your health. It's a joke. It's a great way to learn about the anti-vaccine movement and make money on it.
22,4,"...but if the government isn't using a mask to stop the spread of the virus, it's not a joke. [http://www.reddit.com/r/advice_to_vaccination_deployment/comments/105417_en/](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adversary)."
25,4,I don’t know what’s in your interpretation.
27,4,"What about the other parts of the article? They're all in the same cult, so the fact that he hasn't had anything done that would be in the headline of the article doesn't matter."
31,4,I’m going to get downvoted for the title. I don’t have a problem with the skunk masks in r/articles.
47,4,"I think the ACA is a good one. I think he should do something about it because he's a fan of the NRA, and his sex act is very offensive."
49,4,IANAL. I just stumbled across a whole new subreddit. I don't even know what to write about them.
57,4,I guess what's funny about this subreddit is the sexist jokes that everyone makes about it and I think they're just a joke.
59,4,So what is the issue with people who are wearing masks?
60,4,It's only a joke. That's a joke. The joke is about the government helping to prevent the spread of a virus.
61,4,"I thought the word was ""the dick"" so I went for it."
82,4,"It's not that I think the government is using violence against people, it's that I think it's better to stick to what they're doing than to try and work on making you feel safe and welcome in a workplace where you don't have to be in an environment where you aren't gonna get caught and will feel abused. It's not like you can't keep your cool because you know it's in your own home. It's not really a good idea to fire people for being able to get a fucking thing on you"
99,4,"""The only way to get a virus is to be vaccinated. It's not mandatory by the government."""
8,4,I agree that this article is pretty blatantly obtuse and ridiculous.
9,4,I'm sure the most popular joke I've seen has been:
14,4,Wearing a mask doesn't protect anyone. People who have no mRNA or tRNA carry a virus and have to wear a mask do not protect themselves.
22,4,"[In this case, it's not a joke. I am not a doctor, but I'm a medical professional. I can tell you from experience that the one part of this is really funny, but that part of it is just a joke. The fact that it would be funny to get the CDC's attention is quite pathetic. I’m really sick and impatient. Wearing masks does not help in stopping the spread of a virus, it's useless and I hate it."
25,4,"And the EPA is trying to make it more fun to work at the restaurant I work at, but the skunks in the restaurant don’t work in that area and can’t afford to work there. This is very, very funny if you ask me."
27,4,"They can't, as it seems like they want to. The article states, ""Also, don't you think the EPA and NRA are doing it so that the people in charge don't have to worry about how the government is doing it?"""
31,4,>The CDC has a reputation for being sexist and a parasite. The government is a parasite.
47,4,Vaccines don't make people sick. They just want to keep them alive.
49,4,I am not a racist. And I don't think you are going to think about what you've said.
57,4,"As a coach I do not like this comment. I don't like this comment, he seems to have the opposite attitude."
59,4,OP: I'm glad people don't wear masks anymore in my state.
60,4,"The post itself is completely irrelevant, and I think he was just being humorous. In fact, he was saying something about the government helping to prevent the spread of the virus and that ''juke'' was the only joke that the article says."
61,4,"The only person who cared about this was the CDC. The CDC does not have the authority to rehabilitate people, and it has no authority to rehabilitate anyone."
82,4,It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. This is a comedy or book about the government. It's basically the same thing. There is no law against it.
99,4,"That's all of the ""I think the government is just trying to be a joke."" I mean they are trying to bring up the issue of how to get rid of a virus and why should they be able to prevent people from getting vaccinated."
8,4,(https://www.r/advice.htm).
9,4,I love when this topic is discussed here.
14,4,What? Are there people who think people are going to do it? Is the CDC trying to cut the joke?
22,4,"I know that the joke isn't about this but... I am not a 'prosecutor' and the joke is ""what does the government do in the US?"""
25,4,"Because a prank is an AMA. There are not too many AMAs on skunks. It's probably not a joke because it's a joke. The AMA is a joke, and the AMA is not the most intelligent."
27,4,"There is nothing more to laugh at and that’s okay. I’m not a lawyer, but I can’t see what it’s about."
31,4,"""Still in the discussion. I've been watching for about 6 months"""
47,4,"I can see how you'd feel if this was a joke. But in reality, it was a joke in itself. This is a joke."
49,4,It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's not a joke. It's a joke.
57,4,"I like to think of myself as a president, not a pedophile, not an obstetrician."
59,4,I think the whole thing seems a little naive. Is this a joke because the government is a big corporate?
60,4,“I just don’t see how it’s funny.
61,4,I grew up in a place where a lot of people voted for a health care plan and their mom was on antibiotics. My mother was in the hospital.
82,4,"The only reason for a law is to make sure they do it because there are no other laws in place in that country that will help the skunks. The government and the EPA will not stop the spread of the virus, which is an issue in the US."
99,4,The issue here is that the government is going to make the public aware that it's a joke and that it's making money for it.
8,4,There is something more to this.
9,4,"I read a great article called [['The ACA isn't a joke. It's just a joke. I want people who would want to do the apologies or nihilism to stop using the CDC's health information to make the decision that it's a prank, to stop the spread of AIDS? I don't think it's a joke."
14,4,"I think you're being a prick, and not a politician. But it's worth looking up in your head as a lawyer, because there is a lot of stuff you can find that makes you laugh."
22,4,I've also heard that the CDC is the only company that has not actually been able to do it.
25,4,I don't think the AMAs are meant to be funny or informative. I just thought it was a nutjob. The author is trying to argue against the ACA. The AMAs aren't funny.
27,4,">The only reason we have this is that people have different reactions to things, whether they're tainted by an EPA employee or a government agency."""
31,4,"No, you're not right. I'm going to give you the word ""skunk mask"" and use it for all the people."
47,4,People don't get vaccinated in the same way that people do in other countries.
49,4,"People are saying this, and they're expressing it. This isn't racist, it's about being racist."

60,4,"""The whole point of being a joke is that it makes people uncomfortable"" - if you can slap a guy in the face with a mask if he doesn't care about it"
61,4,"That's a tad extreme. You could say something like ""Are you aware that the government is invading an entire nation?"" or ""I think people are joking about the fact that the US government is a pretty terrible place to live."""
82,4,EPA & EPA are also putting more resources into helping people and not inflicting such abuse on a community. So they can fire people for wearing a mask outside. It isn't a crime to wear a mask in public.
99,4,"There is actually no law against that in our nation. That is the rule. The government is not obliged to give people a vaccine because of personal hygiene, and that is exactly what is illegal. We should have a law that essentially doesn't apply to it."
