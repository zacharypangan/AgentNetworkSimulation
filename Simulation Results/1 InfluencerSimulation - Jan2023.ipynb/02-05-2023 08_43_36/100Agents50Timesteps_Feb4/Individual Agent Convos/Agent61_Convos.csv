71,61,oh man you should come to georgia it s like people here think wearing a mask gives them covid there s so few
79,61,i m not against vacks mandates cuz i don t think i ll catch the cough i already had it i m against them cuz they ruin the economy get people fired and people should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force
85,61,see this is how crazy trump s made the united states of america if you want order in america president donald j trump must take off his mask and turn himself in oh and every day he doesn t people will die starting tonight i m a man of my word covid
91,61,how does the mask make his breath come out of the back of his head
61,3,They are being used to try to keep people from dying from the virus.
61,4,[TwitchCon] (https://www.maelmaelmae.com/context/) [Witting a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus](http://www.maelmaelmaelmaelmaelmaelmaelmaelmaelmaelmaelmaelmaelmaelmaelmaelm
61,5,You've got a twitchcon mask!
61,8,We have a lot of people hating on the idea of having a mask to protect people from the virus.
61,10,i m going to say this about twitchcon and masks you can hate me if the state town doesn t have an mandates you can hate me if the state town doesn t have an mandates you can hate me if the state town doesn t have an mandates you can hate me if the state town doesn t have an mandates you can hate me if the state town doesn t have an mandates you can hate me if the state town doesn t have an mandates
61,16,If it doesn't have mandates I'm sorry i'm leaving..
61,21,I'm a vaccinated person with boosters and I don't think i can wear a mask as a vaccinated person with boosters.
61,22,What do you want to see happen when you go to TWitchcon?
61,29,"I'm afraid to say it but I'm still going to put on my mask if it's not required on my part. This means I have a virus that cannot be vaccinated, but I m afraid to say the mask is not mandatory for this particular state. It's not mandatory at all."
61,47,I'm going to say this about twitchcon and masks you can hate me if the state town doesn't have an mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask
61,55,Twitchcon is the last event where you can wear a mask and have the flu
61,58,"Yeah, the truth is that a guy with boosters has the vaccine he needs to wear a mask with the vaccinated person in it - even though he isn't fully vaccinated - and I think a mask is worthless"
71,61,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
79,61,Are you a Republican? What are you wearing in the first place?
85,61,I think the guy is an incompetent idiot who can eat a sandwich for his meal. He is also a degenerate who can eat pizza for his food. The trick is to eat more pizza. If I eat it i can go eat more pizza. But i do not eat more pizza. I do not eat that much pizza.
91,61,This is a problem with the federal government.
61,3,You can't get mad that an event doesn't have a mandate to prevent people from dying from the virus.
61,4,"I don't care for people like you either. You will probably feel worse if you do, but I'm saying the government is trying to get people to come up with some policies that, for the sake of the American people, aren't allowing it."
61,5,The fact that this is an upcoming event on the TV news site is very disturbing to me.
61,8,What does that say about the other part of the article?
61,10,"""Making a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
61,16,"If you're vaccinated with a vaccine and don't like them, why aren't you allowed to wear the mask when you can't do that?"
61,21,I think this is a problem with the federal government.
61,22,"If you want a lot of people to decide if you like TWitchcon, go to a TWitchcon. Do not buy it. Do not wear it."
61,29,Are you a Republican? What are you wearing in the first place? I think the guy is an incompetent idiot who can eat a sandwich for his meal. He is also a degenerate who can eat pizza for his food. The trick is to eat more pizza. If I eat it i can go eat more pizza.
61,47,When I was in the military I always put on my mask because I could see the actual 'Factory' on the sidelines and it made the fight to stop twitchcon more dangerous.
61,55,Oh my god :( r/police
61,58,"If they are required to wear a mask, why can't they just remove it? I'm just saying it is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
71,61,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
79,61,"This is basically the same thing that happens to everyone in the US. The masks are good, they prevent the spread of viruses. But you could never have any kind of control over them. You could even wear a mask."
85,61,Isn't that the one movie I watched with Obama?
91,61,The problem is that the federal government doesn't have the ability to have an official that isn't involved with the problem. The problem is that there is no right or wrong way for them to say what they want.
61,3,"It's an example of the same thing that happens to everyone in the US, a lot of people are vaccinated, and they still don't really care about twitchcon. The facts, on the other hand, is a lot less interesting."
61,4,"I don't know much about the subject, but they're getting a lot of media attention for their ""twitchcon"" stuff. It's the one event they're talking about."
61,5,"Getting to know the people who are being vaccinated is a very basic part of how you protect yourself from viral infection. It doesn't mean there are no right or wrong ways to do this. You should probably look into what the government actually does and learn about it. It is very hard to come up with a policy that will prevent that type of behavior from happening. I mean, I don't know what they do, but it may not be something they can say to you."
61,8,The problem is that the federal government doesn't have the ability to have an official that isn't involved with the problem.
61,10,OP: There is a problem with the government in the USA.
61,16,I think the whole reason that they're not allowed to do this is because the government is not doing something to stop people from dying from the virus.
61,21,"I like this guy, he isn't the president that he thinks is the best candidate to represent. I want people to decide if they like twitchcon, but it's not."
61,22,>Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
61,29,A CDC report that states that we can not go to a TWitchCon event where a virus will not be vaccinated is that this is a problem with the federal government? That seems to be an interesting question.
61,47,You can't wear a mask. It's part of the measures deployed by the federal government.
61,55,"The government is trying to get people to come up with some policies that, for the sake of the American people, aren't allowing it."
61,58,"This is basically the same thing that happens to everyone in the US. The masks are good, they prevent the spread of viruses. But you could never have any kind of control over them. You could even wear a mask. The problem is that the federal government doesn't have the ability to have an official that isn't involved with the problem. The problem is that there is no right or wrong way for them to say what they want."
71,61,"I went to college in Georgia and one of my coworkers would try and tell me I needed a mask and he would come to the school and say, Oh, what's wrong with it? I was in that school."
79,61,"I don't think it's a big deal. We are just there to protect the people. We want to do something about it, not just make sure the government isn't using it."
85,61,Are you aware that the government is invading an entire nation?
91,61,">He didn't want to get an AMA or TAX in public, so he could not get an AMA, so they did it anyways."
61,3,"I would like to say that it was not something that the President was supposed to be doing, because that's how he wanted the government to respond to his threats, because it's not a thing that the government should be doing. Is there anything I can do that could really save people's lives? Is there something I can do to make the government more involved in that issue?"
61,4,Vaccination is a crime and your parents should not have to deal with it.
61,5,"It's the same thing that happens to everyone in the US. The masks are good, they prevent the spread of viruses. But you could never have any kind of control over them. You could even wear a mask. It's an example of the same thing that happens to everyone in the US, a lot of people are vaccinated, and they still don't really care about twitchcon. The facts, on the other hand, is a lot less interesting."
61,8,"You can wear a mask, but it does not have to be a mask or an ad, because the government has absolutely no way of doing that."
61,10,"I was in a similar situation at a CDC event. The fact that it was a school that you could not go to, is the point of what I got. I stayed to watch the twitchcon and I could barely figure out what my coworker was saying about it. He wouldn't even let me eat something that wasn't in my hand. It was a very important part of the process of infection control and prevention. I was on a government agency board and one person told me that it was because it was important that they do this. I'm not"
61,16,Apparently you can't wear a mask in the United States.
61,21,>Isn't that the one movie I watched with Obama? The problem is that the federal government doesn't have the ability to have an official that isn't involved with the problem.
61,22,>Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
61,29,I would not think of it as a problem with the government. I think that there are plenty of people who think that the government is invading an entire nation.
61,47,>You can't wear a mask. It's part of the measures deployed by the federal government.
61,55,"It's not a problem. You want to see if there are people in the country that aren't going to see a TWitchCon event because of the health care reforms. The government is not doing anything to stop the spread of viruses, they are doing a job protecting them."
61,58,"I'm an affluent person who lives in the US and the first thing I know about the TWitchcon is that I don't have a license to do so, but I do know that you don't know much about the TWitchcon."
71,61,"oh man, I've never seen it, but my friend said it's a fucked up movie that is part of the movie, isn't it?"
79,61,I'm going to say the opposite. I'd be quite surprised if the state could have mandated it without changing it.
85,61,> wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
91,61,Having to wear a mask in a medical setting for a short period of time is a lot harder than it should be. AMA's are usually aimed at the medical field.
61,3,There are many aspects to the problem that the federal government has. I would be very interested in a way to make a government-sponsored health screening to make sure the gov't isn't using the sysadmins a big deal and have them vaccinate everyone involved. It might be a way to help you figure out how to do it. I will let you know if you want to do that.
61,4,"Is the government trying to convince you that if you don't mind, then you shouldn't be allowed to wear a mask. ''We are just there to protect the people. We want to do something about it, not just make sure the government isn't using it. Are you aware that the government is invading an entire nation?"
61,5,This isn't about the masks.
61,8,"That's a VERY important point. If you want to use a mask, you need to use a mask."
61,10,>Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
61,16,"They are using the same tactic and methods to get people's vaccines, instead of getting them off to do the same tactic and doing whatever else they want with the health care reforms."
61,21,"I'm very sorry OP, but the US government's decision to ignore the CDC's warning about the issue is extremely controversial."
61,22,"It's probably a sign of a state that is being edgy, or that some people are afraid that they will see something not only happening but that they aren't going to be aware that it's happening and don't know if the person will come and wear the mask or not."
61,29,I don't think there is a problem with the government. It's a problem with the government. There's a problem with the government.
61,47,He is right. The act of vaccination is inconvenient and is a major part of it. I would say that there is a lot of nonsense going on here. He is being vague and cynical.
61,55,"I know this is a big deal, but it's not the government's job to make this a problem. It's a problem, and it's not a problem at all. It's one of the few times the government is being able to make something of it, but that is it."
61,58,"That's one thing. It's also another thing, in a different light, to say, that the government is trying to create a new era of ""adoption""."
71,61,"I think you're the victim. I see people using that phrase all the time, it's kinda like you're saying 'Waving a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
79,61,CANNOTANSWER OP
85,61,Are you aware that the government is invading an entire nation?
91,61,"It's the very definition of a medical issue, not a health issue."
61,3,It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
61,4,">The act of vaccination is inconvenient and is a major part of it. It's one of the few times the government is being able to make something of it, but that's not a problem at all."
61,5,"""Well, we are the one with the mask, so we just need to make sure everyone is safe. Let me start with a word about this. I don't like the idea of people being ""pooped"" for some reasons."
61,8,"The article is all about the government invading a nation, which is one of the reasons the US government is unable to do any of the other things necessary for an effective health care reform."
61,10,Is the CDC being edgy or just cynical?
61,16,"I think you're being very confused here, I am not saying they don't have a problem with this issue. I am saying that this is a big deal with a big deal with an entire nation. It's a major problem with the government."
61,21,"CANNOTANSWER OP Are you aware that the government is invading an entire nation? It's the very definition of a medical issue, not a health issue."
61,22,This isn't something the government wants to solve. Isn't it a very large government problem that we all have in common. I am not interested in seeing it.
61,29,I think the government is invading an entire nation. It's not just a political issue.
61,47,"Is there a difference between ""We are just there to protect the people. We want to do something about it, not just make sure the government isn't using it."" and ""Is it about the masks?""?"
61,55,The government is trying to influence the public to come up with an ACA to stop the spread of a virus and that's just trying to get people to come up with ACA to end the issue. There's a problem with the government.
61,58,"It's a problem, not a problem at all."
71,61,>Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
79,61,"I'm against the government, but I can't imagine being a republican who likes to call them a petty joke."
85,61,"Unless he has a good source, I don't think the CDC's claim is true. I'm not saying they are invading an entire nation, but in the context of a national health system it seems like this is a really good idea."
91,61,"Yes, there's a whole lot of talk of being a skunk guy."
61,3,The first two comments are a bit misleading because it says that the President's actions in responding to his threats were a problem in the government's eyes and I think it has something to do with the state of health.
61,4,You've got to go back and read the article.
61,5,I don't think you can say that that is a petty joke.
61,8,"i think you're the victim. I see people using that phrase all the time, it's kinda like you're saying 'Waving a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. I think you're the victim. I see people using that phrase all the time, it's kinda like you're saying 'Waving a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
61,10,This isn't a CDC article. It is the same article referred to in other subs: [Page 301](http://hs.cdc.gov/topics/faq-of-faqs-of-faqs-of-faqs-of-faqs/article_301_in/hsa-of-faqs-of-faqs/faq_of_faqs/faqs/what-faqs/
61,16,They are doing everything they want. They are attempting to put people in danger by cutting off access to vaccines.
61,21,"You're right, and I think that's not true, but a bunch of other things that's happening in that issue. I don't think the issue would ever be addressed with the CDC. But the problem with them isn't that they aren't the government, it's that the government is influencing it. It's a problem, not a problem at all."
61,22,I think you're missing the underlying point. I don't know what you're talking about.
61,29,"There's actually a huge amount of data that is being provided by the CDC. They're not just trying to protect the public from the government, but a lot of them do, and the government hasn't stepped in to prevent it. It's all about the government invading an entire nation, which isn't just a political issue."
61,47,The whole thing is really petty.
61,55,"This is a major issue for the CDC, but I doubt that any of it is an issue."
61,58,"I'm just going to say that it's not a bad idea to wear a mask, but that it's a good idea for people to be vaccinated, a real life savage."
71,61,"""I go to college in Georgia and one of my coworkers would try and tell me I needed a mask and he would come to the school and say, Oh, what's wrong with it? I was in that school."""
79,61,"The implication is that the US government is a depraved petty petty, and there are a lot of ways for government to control public policies. This is not the case for everyone in the US. It is a petty joke, but not a criminal one, in my opinion."
85,61,"""Do you think the president's reaction to the idea is pretty funny and I think you are being sarcastic. Yes. In a sarcastic way. But the point was that he is being a complete idiot."
91,61,I really don't get the point of the story. I'm going to cite a few different people as a source for that.
61,3,>Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.>

61,8,... because of the government trying to make the country safer
61,10,You don't seem to understand why the CDC has made threats to stop the spread of viruses?
61,16,"I'm not going to say that this is a petty joke, but I'll tell you what I read. I'm not going to lie to you, because it is not a joke."
61,21,"Yes, there's plenty of ways for the federal government to control public policy."
61,22,"I've been to a lot of CDC events lately. I've had several major disasters in my life, I was at TWitchCon and they were horribly effected. There was nothing edgy or wrong about this but I was pretty sure the government was getting mad about something else. I've never seen any skunks going on in TWitchCon, but it was a pretty bad experience."
61,29,"I think the point of the article is that it says that the government is invading an entire nation. The implication is that the US government is a depraved petty petty, and there are a lot of ways for government to control public policies. It is not the case for everyone in the US. It is a petty joke, but not a criminal one, in my opinion."
61,47,What's wrong with the masks?
61,55,"I'm gonna say that they are attempting to put people in danger by cutting off access to vaccines. I'm against the government, but I can't imagine being a republican who likes to call them a petty joke."
61,58,""" Having a mask is a bad idea to me. Rather than preventing the spread of viruses, it is a good idea to protect people from them.... because of the CDC and their inability to do it effectively,"""
71,61,"""I don't care if it's okay to make a life better and want to help. I don't care what the government does or doesn't do."""
79,61,"I don't think you have a lot of information here. I don't think the idea of wearing a mask outside of a vehicle is inherently illegal, but its legal to wear a mask if it's really necessary to protect yourself."
85,61,"It's a good point, but I think you need to have a look at the current situation in the world with regard to people wearing masks."
91,61,"Well, we've gotten past the whole ""I can't believe we're here to save the world."" to the ""My parents fought against me for 20 years with an arm and a leg""."
61,3,"Having a mask is not illegal, it is actually something that CDC has not done. CDC is not legally required to issue a vaccine to anyone."
61,4,It doesn't even have to be illegal to wear a mask outside of a vehicle. It just has to be a policy.
61,5,I've sworn to speak for the government as a volunteer in the CDC (I'm from Florida).
61,8,"So, you've heard of the CDC's attempt to stop the spread of a virus?"
61,10,It would be funny for the president to take a look at the current situation with regard to people wearing masks.
61,16,My coworkers were always very upset because the CDC was being extremely overly protective and I figured that if you had a mask there would be a huge problem.
61,21,"Well, I guess you're the one who needs to think about this, because I'm in Georgia. I'm a vaccinated person with boosters who wears masks for a lot of events and I'm in college. I'm a vaccinated person with boosters, so I need to be able to afford one. I don't like my school anymore because of the masks."
61,22,"My husband is wearing a mask all the time, and he can't stop the CDC from cutting access to vaccines. 'The implication is that the US government is a depraved petty petty, and there are plenty of ways for government to control public policy."
61,29,There is a lot of information out there about that CDC report. [NAME] is a public health agency in Georgia.
61,47,"Yes. The point is that the US government is a depraved petty petty, and there are a lot of ways for the government to control public policy."
61,55,">This is a major issue for the CDC, but I doubt that any of it is an issue."
61,58,I went to a TWitchCon and there were three major disasters going on. One was really bad. And then the second was awful. They were all too far away to have the same sort of problems in the CDC. So they started doing it at the TWitchCon because the government was so evil and trying to bring attention to the CDC.
71,61,>I think he is trying to take advantage of that. I think people are joking about the fact that the US government is a pretty terrible place to live.
79,61,"If there is a good reason to wear a mask outside of a vehicle, why don't you just take a dick or go to court to prove that they don't care?"
85,61,"The problem is that people who wear a mask are not supposed to re-educate kids with a mask, they have been re-educating them with masks."
91,61,"The author of this video is trying to convince a few people that the government is sabotageing the system. It's a documentary, I'm sure."
61,3,"Well, if you can show the CDC that your parents have not fought against you with an arm and a leg, why don't you get the CDC to provide them with one?"
61,4,I was in the CDC for 10 years and we had a lot of great problems.
61,5,It's very disturbing to me. The CDC is a public health agency in Georgia.
61,8,"I'm actually a vaccinated person with boosters who wears masks for a lot of events and I'm in college. I'm a vaccinated person with boosters who wears masks for a lot of events and I'm in college. I'm a vaccinated person with boosters, who wears masks for a lot of events and I'm in college. I'm a vaccinated person with boosters who wears masks. I'm a vaccinated person with boosters"
61,10,"'The implication is that the US government is a depraved petty petty, and there are plenty of ways for the government to control public policy."
61,16,"This is not just a joke, it's a statement made about how the government is going to be in charge of health."
61,21,I'm not sure I can explain this correctly but I do believe a lot of the people in this thread are aware of the CDC.
61,22,They aren't'real'things. They aren't 'allowed' by the government to do anything.
61,29,Having a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
61,47,The guy who is trying to convince a few people that the US government is sabotageing the system.
61,55,Is there an appropriate time for people to go to TWitchCon to get vaccines?
61,58,"So what do the other states have about having an official that isn't involved in the situation? They're essentially the same government as they are. They don't have a right to do anything that's not legally required, but their problem with the government is that the federal government isn't involved with the issue."
71,61,"I see people using that phrase all the time, it's kinda like you're saying 'Waving a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.'"
79,61,"So why does a mask require a license? The government has no responsibility for ensuring the health of the public. OP is a racist, he is not."
85,61,"Why did you buy a mask at the time? It's pretty cool, but I think it's a big deal."
91,61,Because this guy is going to die without a mask. The NRA sabotages the health care system because it isn't responsible for the health of the health care system.
61,3,"I've actually been to a CDC event, and that is about the biggest thing I've ever seen. They are the worst government sabotage force you to go to, and I am sure the CDC is involved, which is why I'm sure they sabotage it."
61,4,Vaccination is a crime and your parents should not have to deal with it. I think people are joking about the fact that the US government is a pretty terrible place to live.
61,5,"What you're describing is a public health agency in Georgia. Not a government agency, but a health agency that was formed by a government employee to fight the spread of a virus. This guy is saying that they are not allowed to use their public health agency to kill people who don't get vaccines. The NRA is being sabotaged by a government, they are trying to discredit the government, and they are doing it because it doesn't sabotages the health care system."
61,8,"I know, that I've gotten my life's work done, but I don't have the time to look for a different job than the one I have. I have to go to school, I'll have to wear a mask and I don't know how, but I've got the time."
61,10,The CDC isn't a public health agency. The CDC was never a public health agency. The CDC is a 501c3 organization that is running the health care system in Georgia.
61,16,The article I read about it and r/RightsAndReddit is in a completely different subreddit than this post and the entire post is about a lot of things. I don't know why anyone would be upset about the CDC being overly protective.
61,21,The CDC is the problem of all the people who get infected because the CDC doesn't really understand the CDC - and even more the government's control of it.
61,22,''They aren't 'allowed' by the government to do anything. They aren't'real'things. They aren't allowed by the government to do anything.'''
61,29,"OP doesn't seem very well-rounded, but this sounds really crappy."
61,47,The thing is... the president is using his right to twitch. You don't need to be a president to be elected.
61,55,I'm gonna make a point to point out that a mask is not a really good idea.
61,58,Because the government is a dick.
71,61,"People make jokes to make their family look bad, but if they're being sarcastic, they're not funny. It's only the fact that people have a hard time saying that."

61,5,">I don't like the idea of people being ""pooped"" for some reasons."
61,8,>A lot of people don't really like the jokes. I think it's worth looking around and see if I can help you.
61,10,I am not a doctor.

61,21,"I'm a vaccinated person with boosters. I wear a mask every day for the rest of my life. I get sick everyday. I get sick every day. Vaccination is a crime and my parents shouldn't have to deal with it. I don't like politics or politics, but I don't like this. I am the worst person I know."
61,22,"Getting the government to work against these companies is a waste of time. I've got a bunch of my fiancee's kids, but we still have no money to invest in insurance."
61,29,Why do you think a mask is a good idea? Because I'm afraid that the government does not have anything to do with it.

85,61,CANNOTANSWER: a mask would be an ill-fitting idea to protect people in the first place and thus would make people more infected than anyone else.
91,61,CANNOTANSWER:
61,3,"I'd be interested in a way to make a government-sponsored health screening to make sure the CDC isn't using the sysadmins a big deal and have them vaccinate everyone involved.

61,5,It's hard to know which group has a mandate or what is the specific reason for it. And I'd bet that's the reason he didn't wear one himself.
61,8,It was written by a doctor with a high degree of fluency in immunology.
61,10,ah the CDC isn't a public health agency.
61,16,I have a lot of misconceptions about 'putting people in danger'. I'm not a doctor. But I'm not a physician.

91,61,A lot of people have misunderstood how the NRA is a terrorist group - who in turn is not responsible for preventing the spread of a virus in their country or at least helping the federal government.
61,3,They are not a government agency. They haven't been able to issue vaccines in the past. But they are trying to sabotage this idea by not making people on their health care vaccinated and giving them the proper information.

I would be a bit more surprised if this would make a comment about someone in the country that didn't have a mask but is a nyc representative, and was in the US for a while and haven't been to a 'funny' post. That was pretty unrelated to the whole conversation."
61,21,"You should think about the possibility of doing a public health screening. A snarky joke is a snarky one, but I think you should consider doing the right thing."

61,47,"There's a difference. They can't simply have the government sabotage all public health in this way. But it's a great way to help the NRA.

61,58,This is why I have a lot of friends.
71,61,You could say it. It's pretty cool how people can take advantage of it but sometimes it just doesn't work.

61,21,The people in the thread genuinely want to know what's really going on. Then it becomes clear that this isn't the point of this discussion. It's the way people make fun of the government. You should tell them this:
61,22,You've got the right message here: I am trying to convince you that the government doesn't want to be a sarcastic prank about the people.
61,29,Isn't the problem with the mask part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus?
61,47,I can't think of a better way to end this. I'm just going to leave.
61,55,I'm not even sure what you mean.

85,61,So is the President using his mask to re-enforce protection from HIV infections? The whole “Making a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.”
91,61,he got hit by a car in the US and got a ticket to New York.
61,3,"So, in order to reaffirm the existence of the government, he had to wear a mask, while in office, and he had to vaccinate people, because there is a possibility he would die?"

71,61,"As someone who travels in the US, the article is clearly referencing the government. It's only one of several ways that I see people joking about the US government."
79,61,"I like this one, a bit more than the others."
85,61,>A little joke about the government is a joke.
91,61,"i mean, i'm sure the government is trying to use the system to fight the skunks to get it to end because i believe that the nra is going to get fired for attempting to use a mask that is intended to stop the spread of the virus?"
61,3,"The president's actions in responding are illegal. If you are not a govt member, you may want to go snoop around your state's health department."
61,4,>I think people in this sub should have a go at these.

61,29,"I don't think that this is the right answer. Having a mask would not be an easy job for people with HIV/AIDS, and I would think the answer isn't in the US because the government is not a skunk group."
61,47,"I have a list of things that don't matter that the law is a joke. It would help if the government was preventing it from being repealed (I would be interested in hearing about it), but I doubt there's a good way to prevent it from being repealed."
61,55,I think it would be great if people would stop thinking about what happened when we have more medical equipment that we could use to prevent illnesses that have not been diagnosed and get the vaccines.
61,58,"The ACA would have nothing to do with them allowing people to get to go to TWitchCon without their vaccinations. That said, it is important to consider that these types of restrictions are being used as a means of preventing this from happening. That isn't something that we should be talking about, and it doesn't have to be something that our own citizens or our government can't afford."

Vaccination is a crime and your parents should not have to deal with it."". ""[The CDC is not legally required to issue a vaccine."""
61,4,"The point is that it's important for the US to know the truth. As you might have noticed, in the past, we've just been inundated with the same kind of stories about the CDC in the states."
61,5,">It seems very strange that you are the only one who has ever commented on the AMA, and you did so in the guise of pointing out a flaw in the government policy, rather than pointing out what is happening - a sham! That's probably why there is an AMA about people getting vaccinated with a mask."
61,8,"I think the ACA is just a joke. I mean, it's a bit off. The only reason this is a joke is that the CDC is trying to be the skunk's main reason for stopping it. This isn't the skunks."

61,21,"I have to be honest - when I first heard about this. It was a lot of humor. I am not a big fan of the CDC or anything in particular. However, it does seem to me like the CDC is the largest employer in the US. And the one thing I find incredibly interesting about these comments is that they have been making fun of the CDC and what they are doing."
61,22,“...the government isn't responsible for everything”
61,29,"It cites the government for the majority of fda cases because he is a bad skunk who is willing to pay for public health care for patients and workers, who are willing to support the government's efforts to protect them."
61,47,No sarcasm. I mean I'm a sane guy who is a nerd and I can't believe a guy could even call his own country to speak about the federal government skunks.
61,55,"No it's not the government's job. But this is a bit like saying that I hate twitch, but that I do not want to wear a mask because I'm a skunk."
61,58,"A lot of the problems mentioned in the article are 'I'm an affluent person who lives in the US' and not ""cannot have any kind of control over them. I don't think they can do it effectively'."

61,3,It sounds like it was a joke and this isn't real. It seems like the president is snagging the government. I don't see the CDC's intentions as being a threat based on the joke.

61,10,I would have thought that it was a joke and not a joke. It is a cliche that we are in a minority and aren't obligated to act on the authority of those who are actually in power. Isn't it a great idea to have the president in charge of your health? Isn't it a nice idea for you to get the president to have your health insurance with him?
61,16,Why is a public health agency involved in this?
61,21,You mean “a person snooping in to their school for a lot of events? I can’t tell you how many masks I’ve got in my bag”? That’s just a joke.

61,8,"I think it's better to just say, ""I'm an vaccinated person with boosters who wears a mask.

I'm a vaccinated person with boosters who wears masks for a lot of events and I'm in college."""
61,10,There's no way the CDC has any authority in regards to vaccines.
61,16,I think you've just misread what you wrote. The article is supposed to be about the government.
61,21,"This is the CDC. The problem is that they are snooping in and causing problems in communities that don't have health insurance. They do not have access to health care. It's all a joke, and there isn't a way to go about it. I don't know much about the other issues but, that's a problem."

61,47,"I think I could go to any of the nationalities requesting that they stop using this kind of vaccine, and go to any of them, as long as they don't get sick or have some kind of cancer or other virus that they don't want to be treated with."
61,55,Having a skunk in a mask at your event and being vaccinated are two very different things.

61,16,It doesn't address the problem at all. It also has nothing to do with the federal government. I don't think it's a very interesting or important question.
61,21,It's not a joke because it doesn't address health care policy. It is a prank because it doesn't address health care policy.

61,22,I've been to several major disasters lately. I was at TWitchCon and they were horribly effected. There was nothing edgy or wrong about this but I was pretty sure the government was getting mad about something else.
61,29,I think a bit of a cliche is used to describe the fact that the federal government doesn't have a mandate on health insurance. You could say that the government isn't able to pass laws to prevent the spread of the virus and he isn't going to be able to help the federal government.

61,10,What's up with the whole CDC and a few other 501c3 entities?
61,16,What the fuck. It's like the government is promoting the wrong kind of vaccinations because they just wanted to give everyone else a chance.

61,58,Nope. A mask is not a joke because the government is promoting the disease.

61,3,It's a prank because the president wants to sabotage everything. It's an interesting fact and an interesting fact to be discussed here.
61,4,So your parents should not have to deal with your mom being on antibiotics?
61,5,"The question isn't: I think he's a politician, so I'm going to ask him if he is a lawyer. He's in that position, but in some circumstances he's a lawyer."
61,8,It's a joke. The NRA is trying to demonize the government. They're trying to make the government more evil than it should be.
61,10,I don't understand why the people who think that the CDC has no authority in regards to vaccinations are so ignorant.
61,16,"I can't imagine what your post would be about. It's too early to tell what you wrote, so you're essentially an asshole."

61,58,There is also the fact that the CDC and NRA have no authority over the health care system. They have absolutely no authority to stop people from getting HIV positive if they want to.
71,61,>I think that most people that don't live in the US don't wear a mask unless it's just for pleasure. They will often make a decision based on what they see as the most important issue in society.

85,61,It's not an anti-vaccination joke.
91,61,"The government is essentially removing the skunk and denying them the right to have the right to control the public's health care, not to put any more blame on it."

61,8,"Vaccination isn't a joke, it is a joke and it's the CDC is the culprit."
61,10,You are describing a different set of people than the other person.
61,16,"Yes, it's a prank. The CDC and NRA have no authority over the health care system. They have no authority to stop people from dying from the virus."
61,21,"Vaccines and masks are a major issue of the US government and the CDC is a major force that's causing the biggest problems in the country. The CDC has literally nothing to do with it. It's more about health care policy than it is about putting the blame on the government. It's the same thing as a dick joke, except it's a bigger problem and the CDC is not."
61,22,"... if it's only a joke, that's a prank."
61,29,It's a joke. It's a joke. I’m not a fan of the ACA but I’m a fan of people who can’t go to events that don’t involve a CDC report. Having a mask is a joke. Having a mask is a joke. It’s a joke.
61,47,What is this Obamacare that's not a joke? Are you saying you want to stay away from it? Are you sure the ACA doesn't support people's rights?
61,55,"The ACA is not a joke, it’s a joke. And I’m not saying it is a joke. I’m saying that people are trying to make people stop looking at a joke about how they’re being a prick."

79,61,People who can't wear a mask aren't going to get sick or die.
85,61,The issue of putting a hat on people who can't get vaccinated with masks isn't as simple as the ACA.
91,61,"I think the author is misrepresenting the point of this article, but he's using it as a way to show the implication that it's not a problem."
61,3,"They're going to make a joke about how they will make the issue worse, but they're bringing them up."
