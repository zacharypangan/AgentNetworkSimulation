    "If the government is trying to make a joke about a disease, it's illegal.",
    "I think this is the kind of joke that I see in every story about people who don't get it, or even who can't believe that it's a joke, or that it's a joke, or that they feel they are being assholes or something, but I just think that it's one of the big things that gets people offended and made me want to stop and make a joke about them.",
    "What is it like to be vaccinated for the rest of your life, eh?",
    "I think you need to take the time to read the article.",
    "It's going to be interesting to read, but I do know the truth. The story is about a guy who just tried to force himself to wear a mask because he thought he could get his husband vaccinated. It's a joke, but the joke is actually really good. I'm not a lawyer, but I'm working on my case in the next two years, and I can tell you that he's going to make a point.",
    ">Hey man! Vaccination isn't a joke. I mean, the government is supposed to be trying to impose a law that prohibits the wearing of a mask as an act of retribution or punishing people, not just the people who knowingly do it. The joke is pretty funny. \"Hey man! Vaccination isn't a joke. I'm not sure what it's about, but I feel like the government is trying to make it enforceable.\" (https://www.",

    "I think I can see a problem here.",
    "I agree with your previous statement, and would like to point out that this article isn't the joke. I've always thought that the CDC is trying to slash off more people to prevent a disease, rather than make a joke about it.",
    "It sounds like this is actually a joke because it seems like it is making a joke. I think it is the point.",
    "Well that's a really good point.",
    "A CDC employee has to wear a mask to protect his wife and children from viruses. If she doesn't do it to avoid being vaccinated, she's not a joke and should never know the consequences of it. She is the mother of the disease.",
    "The first thing you should do is explain it better to the other poster.",

    "> The only way to get a virus is to be vaccinated. It's not an easy thing to do and it's illegal.",
    "So the article states, \"\"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.'",
    "I'm not sure if that's a joke. It's actually a joke.",
    "So in the future if the CDC makes any more outrageous jokes about this the government can say, \"I'm not sure how I feel about this. \"",
    "I'm not saying it's a joke, it's a joke. I just think it's a joke. It's the only way to get a vaccinated, and if the government does this, it's a joke, and you're probably overthinking it because he's not the kind of person to tell a joke about a disease.",
    "I\u2019d suggest you read the whole thing \u2014 this is what you said. It\u2019s a joke. And the whole \u201cNo\u201d, they\u2019re a joke about things, which is a joke."
