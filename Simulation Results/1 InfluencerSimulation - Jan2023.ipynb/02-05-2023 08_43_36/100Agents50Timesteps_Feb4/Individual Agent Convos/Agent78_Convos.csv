78,26,I think we should stop wearing masks in public.
78,29,I've got to go.
78,35,It has been a long time since I checked the Wikipedia page for this. r/advices is actually a very interesting subreddit.
78,37,Isn't the fact that he wears a mask helps stop the spread of the virus sarcastic? Is there a specific reason for why it isn't effective?

78,58,"The other one is based off a joke. OP, I wonder how many people in the United States wear masks at work?"
78,63,It's been mentioned in a bit of the video that it's the first time I've heard of this...
80,78,"It's called 'infected' by the medical staff in DC. In DC, they get to wear a mask in public to help spread the virus, and it varies by school."
82,78,It seems that the government is allowing the person wearing the mask to wear anything outside of the car in the car.
90,78,'This is a good reminder of how to get people to stand up for themselves.' I voted for the mask because a school in Douglas County has already given some good advice to people who are in school because they believe that being out on a date for the first time is going to increase their chances of getting HIV/AIDS and have more public health problems and a greater population in the future. I'm surprised that the only reason for those who didn't vote against the ACA were people who didn't vote for the one that was in a community of people who support their choice

78,13,People in DC do not wear masks to help spread HIV/AIDS.
78,15,"The people who want to wear them don't deserve it. Honestly, I can see a lot of people wearing masks at work in that school."
78,16,I can't get past the fact that you're not a fan of the one-handed government policy.
78,19,... the only reason it isn't effective is because it prevents an infectious disease from spreading.

78,37,I think that the one-handed government policy that is implementing in the US is to allow people to have a helmet in public.
78,38,This is what I think of most of the other comments on r/advices.
78,40,"I've been going out with my dad, and we were very upset that we didn't wear a mask for the ACA."
78,42,A lot of people are concerned about the future of the ACA and are concerned about the health of their workers and the government.
78,46,I don't understand how you're supposed to feel about'sarcasm' and you want to be the only one to find it so funny.
78,52,"I'm not sure what you're talking about, but if you don't wear masks, then you can't take care of yourself without your friends."
78,54,I wonder how many people in the US wear masks at work?
78,56,It's not a joke. It's just the ACA.
78,58,I don't see a single point in trying to stop the spread of the virus in the United States.
78,63,I don't know much about the medical side of things. I'm just curious about the government trying to stop people from wearing masks. I don't think it would be a joke. The idea of people wearing masks will only lead to more people getting HIV/AIDS.

90,78,"I wore a mask on my birthday and a friend of mine wore a mask. And when we walked in the street we were clapping in awe when he did that, it shook my heart and I was like oh, this is not okay? I think it was my responsibility to do my own thing."
100,78,A mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
101,78,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
78,2,I don't really care what the question is. I'm sure you've got it right.
78,5,Basically what I am thinking is that a phd student could use the mask to stop the spread of a virus. It's pretty common for people to wear their masks when they're in public places.
78,8,"I've been in this position for a long time and have never been given a good answer to it. It's my job to make people feel better, and I think I have the right to be upset. But I also think it's so easy to look down on the government if the other person disagrees with them."
78,9,"You are an narcissist who just wants to talk to you, and your response is that you want the ACA to help you deal with the epidemic."
78,13,"I'm not saying I am a good coach, but it seems like a great deal of work and effort goes into making this work. The people who use it actually work on the problem. I think it was my responsibility to do my own thing."
78,15,The issue is not just the ACA but the other factors for people who have HIV/AIDS.
78,16,>I think that the one-handed government policy that is implementing in the US is to allow people to have a helmet in public.
78,19,I don't know what to do with this but you're being really sarcastic - there's a lot of information in here that points to that.

78,35,"So, it is just a joke. But it does sound like an interesting idea. It makes no sense."
78,37,"I wore a mask on my birthday, and the next day I was trying to see how I was feeling on my birthday. It was so awkward I looked up, was unsure why it was so so funny. I was looking at the wikipedia article, and I read the title in the hope that I'm not the only one that find it so funny."
78,38,We've got this as a matter of fact. And I've got this as a reason I don't care.
78,40,The problem is that the government is attempting to make them wear a mask in public. People who are in the minority are assuming they won't be able to pay for them.
78,42,"I think that's one of the major things that I'm very sensitive to, but I really don't have the time to be, in public unless I'm in the army. I think I can be of some assistance."
78,46,I think there is a point of being sarcastic.
78,52,Is there anything I can tell you you can do to support the ACA and the ACA itself? You've done absolutely nothing wrong.
78,54,"I'm a very experienced, irrational person. But what if we can't be bothered to make fun of this? We're just not allowed to wear our hats in public."
78,56,The whole thing is going on in my head. What if my friend in high school had to take a picture in front of me and say 'This mask really makes him feel better'? I can't believe the people on r/advices have not come up with something similar in their whole life. Certainly I don't like the government trying to change that and it seems like it will not happen.
78,58,"I'd probably want to wear a mask in the car to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS in my state. But a helmet is actually a skewed way of saying something like, ""You're a terrible person. The idea that people need to wear a mask is a joke."""
78,63,"I don't like how you aren't using the word ""sarcastic"" to describe this, you're using the word ""dick"". That's a sarcastic one."
80,78,"So, they don't use the masks and wear it while in public - which doesn't mean they don't want to - in schools?"
82,78,"I can't imagine how people feel about people who wear masks outside of their cars if they get sick, unless they are trying to keep it from happening in their own cars."
90,78,I'm surprised that the government has been campaigning to change the ACA so it's a bad idea to wear the mask in public places like schools. I'm surprised that the only reason for those who didn't vote against the ACA was people who didn't vote for the one that was in a community of people who support their choice.

78,9,Is there anything you can do to support the ACA and the ACA itself?
78,13,"I think the best thing he can do is get some more money, and then get sick or get out of the car."

78,37,Wearing a mask in public doesn't help prevent the spread of a virus. It's not a joke.

78,42,"It’s not an easy thing to do, is it? A person that has never done it would actually have a bad time. They just couldn’t afford the insurance."
78,46,"It's actually quite a common concept among people in the US to do something so stupid. The ACA does not affect the safety of our people, it doesn't prevent a lot of harm from our lives. If you are worried about the future of your country you should seek legal assistance for."

78,56,"I'm not very good at twitting. I'm a very experienced, irrational person, and I don't think I've ever been in such a situation. But I can say I'm not sure what this guy means. I'm just curious."
78,58,My friend's father also wore a mask on his birthday. The one-handed policy is to get him to wear it at work.
78,63,he said he would be surprised if they had just put a mask on the neck and not wear them in the public - I mean he actually felt better and didn't even get sick from wearing it. I would like to think that I was wrong.
80,78,"It's called ""Assisting the spread of a virus"" as I think it is. The ACA was passed on April 1st, 2012, and the US Congress passed the 'Holding the Vaccines Act' to stop the spread of a virus. It isn't a law, just an idea."
82,78,They're not going to change their policies that prevent that from happening. Especially since they won't.
90,78,This ain't good. You can't be in a place where it's not allowed.
100,78,"I think that the fact that he's trying to cite the article as ""serious"" is a big red flag."
101,78,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
78,2,"ACA is a thing of the past. The federal government is trying to pass something like that, and its not allowing people to wear one handed masks in public - a huge red flag."
78,5,"It’s called ""Assisting the spread of a virus"" as I think it is."
78,8,"People that want to be protected under the ACA have no right to wear a mask in public. They're merely trying to make people feel better. It's not good. It's not a joke. The answer is simple: a helmet will be inefficient, cause you will die, or die. You will only have an ACA to save your life."
78,9,"I think you are missing the point. There is an important problem. If you don't like it, don't. If you don't like it, don't."
78,13,>I think that the one-handed government policy that is implementing in the US is to allow people to have a helmet in public.
78,15,"I was told by a friend of mine, that we are able to use some masks to stop the spread of a virus if we wear them. They are so strong that they can help combat it. We were taught this as a child, so we can only use them in cases where we don't have an insurance policy that allows them to do so. I was also taught this as a child to wear masks in public, which is a very common idea among people in the US."
78,16,"The ACA is actually aimed at helping to prevent more people from getting sick from wear a mask. But it's a fucked up policy that doesn't work on other countries, such as Africa."
78,19,"We all eve a mask at least once a year in our country, and a big part of it is the protection we give our children. I'm pretty sure the idea of a vaccination in the US is not really a joke because there isn't much they can do in that regard. I mean, unless they use that as an excuse to not support the vaccination. I'm pretty sure they would support vaccinating the people who do it because it does nothing to save them from sanity."
78,26,This is the most stupid and ridiculous and naive comment I have ever heard.
78,29,"'How does the mask make his breath come out of the back of his head?', ""I do not know how many people in DC are aware of this, but it is a very common problem."""
78,35,I think the whole thing is 'It seems to make the ACA work'...
78,37,You are so witty.
78,38,I don't think it's very difficult to get a good conversation going. The idea that people shouldn't have to wear their helmets if it isn't a law is silly.
78,40,"They could get away with that, but I can't imagine the cost to go out and get a helmet is astronomical, whereas in the US, people can afford the cost of the whole thing in general, if they are willing to pay for the helmet. It's basically just a'safety issue' that makes people sick if they aren't in a position to pay for it."

78,58,So the government was telling the people to go to work and buy the masks?
78,63,"i would like to think that I was wrong. It's called ""Assisting the spread of a virus"" as I think it is."
80,78,I'm a doctor. I've been a doctor for years. There's not a lot that I can say that helps prevent the spread of this virus.
82,78,I'm a doctor who's been in the military and have had my head tattooed off with a mask.
90,78,You have to vote to change your ACA to a neocon conservative-sanctioned state.

101,78,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
78,2,"I'm not saying that the masks would stop the spread of a virus, but instead that they would prevent more people from getting sick from wearing them. That's just a fucked up ACA policy and it's a waste of money."
78,5,I'm not a fan of the one part of the ACA that we're essentially giving out.
78,8,I'm not sure if there's any evidence at all that the ACA actually works or if the other party is arguing that it works.
78,9,"'My son was a doctor for 25 years, and we've always been narcissists to the extent that I am convinced that the ACA is a major disaster.'"
78,13,"What would they do if the government would not just ban helmets? If the government wanted to do that, why not?"
78,15,What is the point of wearing a mask in public?

78,40,They are sarcastic. I just don't understand their point in the ACA.
78,42,"It is not an easy thing to do, but it can be done. The only real issue is to get people in the military to wear their masks. In general, if they are the first ones to have a hooded shirt or pants on they are considered to be a bit risky."

78,52,> I don't think any of these are stupid comments at all.
78,54,I'm not sure that the government will go against the grain of the ACA and the current ACA is going to be the least irrational thing you can do if your face is ripped open by the government.
78,56,> So the government was telling the people to go to work and buy the masks?
78,58,"I've heard that people can wear helmets in public, but they have a different problem. That said, I don't really care. I'd love to get a helmet because there are so many of us. I don't have a mask, and I have no idea why - but I'd like to help out if someone wants to help."
78,63,There isn't enough information in here that supports that
80,78,"I don't even know why I believe this. You know it was a joke and you could see it on TV, but you know it."
82,78,It sounds like a nice way to use your phone for that type of discussion.
90,78,Why did the public health board in Douglas County vote against the mask? I guess it doesn't really matter. But why should the school get an AMA?
100,78,i do not know the entire story but i do know the general theme for that event is to make everyone who goes to an event with a rash to wear a mask in order to prevent the spread of viruses. i just know that they don't even have a full vaccine or any other part of the mandatory vaccine.

78,5,"I am sure you already know how much I hate the ACA and think that it will tarnish it over time, but I am going to cite it as the reason it is the best thing to do in the future."
78,8,The best thing to do is to imply that the ACA isn't really the best for people who want to protect themselves from an upcoming virus and that it doesn't necessarily solve all the problems you described.

78,26,"There is nothing in the ACA that would stop you from getting a mask. Having a helmet for your children in your workplace makes it more likely that someone will get the rash out. Besides, you know people who don't get to go to public school, so the only way to get your child into school is to avoid their school. Getting a mask on your head isn't that much of an issue, it's just a way of recognizing when you've got a mask on to get it off before you've started to have one."

78,38,I feel bad for you for mentioning something like this in this sub.
78,40,I'd say the ACA would be a great thing. I've been in the military for many years and it's not really a joke.
78,42,People in DC can wear masks if they are in the army. This is very rare and the government is not going to do this for the rest of the year.
78,46,It's not funny. It's a really funny and interesting idea that makes the ACA work.

78,56,I don't like the government trying to change the ACA.
78,58,"They're really sarcastic. I'm sure that the ACA would not have gotten around to getting people to wear their helmets, and I'm really skeptical of what it might do. The ACA is what they want and they can actually get people to wear them and a vaccination is the only viable option."
78,63,"OP, the idea is not ridiculous and the problem is that people who wear a mask aren't in the minority."
80,78,"I think this is the most depressing and disturbing thing that ever happened in the US. If I were in the states, I'd tell my family and friends to wear a mask. I'm sure they know what the law is and have no idea what the law is."
82,78,The mask in question isn't an issue with the EPA or the government. This is not a matter of the EPA granting a waiver from the EPA if the person is wearing a mask outside of their car to keep their head in the car. The government does not have any power to prevent this.
90,78,"It's probably better to have a conversation with him about it, but it just won't work in this situation. IMO, the movie should be pretty good."
100,78,I'm just saying: I'm pretty sure that I'll not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask in order to prevent the spread of a virus.
101,78,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
78,2,"What is ACA supposed to do? If you've been in the military for many years, a mask is required. It's the only way that a person can have a face mask."
78,5,"So, if someone wants to get their child in school and it's their turn to go to the school, that's fine."
78,8,There's a great documentary titled The Best Way to Get Vaccinated.

78,16,"I mean, this is not the kind of thing that's really fun or exciting, the kind of thing that is fun, or at least what's on a TV."
78,19,That's how a narrator writes it.

78,52,This is an issue that's preventing some from getting the rash out. You guys need to look up the ACA and see how this works.

100,78,It seems that all the people who have gone to a TV event with a rash are just really stupid. Some people get really stupid. I think there is a reason why people still don't need a full vaccine. I don't think they're going to have it or know what to say about it.

78,8,I think you're being sarcastic.

78,13,It sounds like the government is trying to convince people to go on this experiment and try it.

78,9,"I love people who see the message here. The ACA isn't a joke, it's an attempt at putting the government in a situation where they should be able to prevent a public health epidemic. And you narcissist. It's a joke, huh? You don't like it. The ACA is a joke, not an official one. It's a joke."
78,13,"People with HIV/AIDS are not being forced to wear masks at all, they're being forced to do a lot of stupid stupid things."
78,15,The ACA is the joke.
78,16,"There's a joke in the movie ""I'm not a fan of the ACA, but I agree with this"". ""() It is a joke. It is a joke. If this is a joke. In general, if the problem isn't the mask. Its not the idea of a vaccine. Its a joke. In a good way, I think the idea of making people who have a virus be better off without it is just what the ACA is about. I'm not a joke. ""."
78,19,I can't help but wonder why this isn't a joke. It's basically telling people to read through and understand that not everything about the ACA is a joke.
78,26,"The ACA's'reaction' is not a joke, it's a joke. I'm not sure what to say about ""election bias"" and ""horror bias."""
78,29,"I'm gonna imply that all these people were joking in the past because of the ACA. The real problem is that there aren't enough people in the country who actually have to wear a mask. They're supposed to be wearing a mask and there's a problem with a joke or idea of vaccines. But the problem isn't that. If they aren't allowed to do that, the issue won't be there."
78,35,"Isn't the way the CDC was pushing vaccination, rather than trying to make a joke out of it, a joke?"
78,37,"CANNOTANSWER: The only thing I don't understand is the fact that the government is attempting to make them wear a mask in public, and they are not allowed to do so is really telling. The problem isn't the mask."
78,38,"""It seems that the government is allowing the person wearing a mask to wear anything outside of the car in the car. The idea of wearing a mask isn't a joke."
78,40,>It sounds like the government is simply doing the right thing. Is there a way we can stop that from happening?
78,42,This seems like a fairly common joke.
78,46,The entire point of the ACA is to protect Americans from the threat of life-threatening illnesses. Its not a joke. Its just a joke.
78,52,I don't think this is really an official joke. This is the first time a joke is made like this in the internet.
78,54,They were trying to prevent a large number of people from getting sick with a virus from people who wear their masks in public.
78,56,I'd be shocked to hear people start to think that 'the ACA is a joke' is the only one that actually works because it isn't going to be a joke.
78,58,"If the joke isn't based on a joke, then if a government was going to get them to wear them and get the vaccine, they wouldn't have passed the ACA.... and I'm sure it is a joke."
78,63,"CANNOTANSWER: The only thing I don't understand is the fact that the government is trying to make them wear a mask in public, and they are not allowed to do so is really telling."
80,78,"YMMV, I'm sure you've got it right."
82,78,"This is what I'm talking about. I think the government has some real skunk-friendly opinions. Unless the government is claiming to be ""a bunch of shit"", it's still illegal in the US."
90,78,"I believe the ACA was passed by a board of education, the CDC, a school board, and a lobbyist. It's not the same thing as the ACA, and a tad too big for a skunk movie."

78,5,You said that they were attempting to stop the spread of a virus.
78,8,"The problem is a simple one. The answer is simple: a mask will be inefficient, cause you will die, or die. You will only have an ACA to save your life."
78,9,I think you're missing the point. The ACA is a joke.
78,13,"I would be a nutcase, but you can't actually tell me what is a joke until you know why it's a joke. Especially when a skunk movie is based on it."
78,15,I've heard that a lot of people in the US use a mask. If it doesn't work it will not be in the ACA. I think the reason people wear a mask is because the ACA is helping.
78,16,There's a movie where a guy is joking about the ACA a bit ad absurdum claiming the ACA is the only ACA that works?
78,19,"I'm really, really confused by the number. I mean, I know this is going to be a joke, but I don't know if I could think of anything to support it."
78,26,"I'm very, very, very angry with you for this. If it were a joke, I'd say it's an insult."
78,29,"I haven't seen a twitchcon, but that's what I was thinking. The people who were joking in the past have been the ones who have been in the ACA's position. Apparently it's not the same as the ACA, so that's why it is still illegal, because it's an election fraud."
78,35,"I think the point of this is that a joke is just being the ""god, you're not going to be a twitch"" joke. This is a great joke, but I think a lot of people aren't doing the right thing."
78,37,I'm not saying it's an official joke. I'm saying that it's still a joke.
78,38,The thing about the ACA that's funny is that the US does not allow a person to wear a mask at all. A person wearing a mask isn't allowed to wear a mask in public.
78,40,It's not a joke. It's just a joke.
78,42,"I think the current administration is going to look at this as a joke. I don't know what the reason is but it seems like the new ACA seems really silly. They are trying to get people to wear a mask and have vaccines. It is just a joke. Its not just the ACA, its just a joke. Its not about vaccines or anything."
78,46,"No, it's not a joke. It's a joke. If someone's joking, then no sarcasm."
78,52,"There's a joke in the movie ""I'm not a fan of the ACA, but I agree with this"". ""() It is a joke. It is a joke. Its not a joke."
78,54,It's really funny how people are joking around about ACAs.

78,58,"I'm very confused at this point as to why all these people were joking in the past because of the ACA. The ACA, and the ACA's repeal are essentially the same thing."
78,63,"It sounds like the government is simply doing the right thing. The entire point of the ACA is to protect Americans from the threat of life-threatening illnesses. Its not a joke. Its just a joke. ""The real problem is that there aren't enough people in the country who actually have to wear a mask. Its not the same thing as the ACA."
80,78,"I'm a doctor and I wear a mask in public for the purpose of protecting myself, and the children."
82,78,"> It's a crime in the US to wear a mask outside a public place, because it's dangerous to your health. I'm a huge fan of the EPA and the CDC provide. I think it's a good idea to fire people because of the TAX."
90,78,"It's not about whether to wear a mask to make sure it's safe or not. It's about whether the health board should be allowed to use it to make sure it's safe, as opposed to the public health board not. It's all about a guy who's never done it himself because he doesn't have to go to a school, but who's allowed to go to a school. Usually the neocon abolitionists in the schools use it as a distraction from the people who think they're doing something bad"
100,78,"A mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.TX is a small city with a lot of anti-vaccine trolls and some of them go to festivals. If he has been vaccinated, he won't have to wear a mask at his local sporting events. Vaccination is not a requirement of a government agency. Vaccination is a federal mandate that's not enforceable. I mean, they're trying to make them all out of something they are. I'm not"
101,78,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
78,2,"I'm not even sure how witty that is. It was written by one of the biggest anti-vaccine trolls, and the one that said the president ""wasn't going to say anything."
78,5,"I am confused by the ten points of it, but I am not a fan of the ACA. It isn't the ACA."
78,8,"The answer is simple. The answer is simple: a mask will be inefficient, cause you will die, or die. You will only have an ACA to save your life."
78,9,That's the point of a joke.
78,13,/u/SkittlesTwoTwoDucksJokes/) I've never had any experience with the joke but I have seen at least three skunk movies and a couple of some. Some jokes like the ACA and skunk movie are pretty untrue.
78,15,If you don't have insurance you should avoid using it.
78,16,The US has to work very hard to get the ACA repealed.
78,19,A lot of people who have had their head tattooed off with a mask are considered to be a bit risky.
78,26,"""I hate to admit, I'm a politician."""
78,29,i'm not really a big fan of the ACA but i hate it
78,35,"The government acted on the idea of taking out the ACA, despite the fact that it's not the only ACA to work. It's a joke. It's not a joke."
78,37,"This is really a joke, the only way that any joke can be considered a joke is if the government is attempting to make it so that there are more people doing it."
78,38,It is not a joke. It is a joke. It isn't a joke. It isn't a joke. It is a joke.
78,40,i am the lone Republican who voted on the ACA because it had a bad effect on our health.
78,42,"This is a great joke, but I'm very, very angry with you for this. If it were a joke, I'd say it's still a joke."

78,56,"I'm so sorry for the confusion, but I just can't imagine a joke going around to tell a different person in another language than I do and why he's trying to use a mask on their friend. This whole thing is hilarious, and I just can't even imagine how many people in the audience actually have to wear a mask. I'm sure this isn't what it sounds like..."
78,58,"I'd be pretty upset if it was actually a joke, because I'm a doctor, and I'm a doctor."
78,63,The issue is not the actual threat. Its the threat of the whole system. Its a joke.
80,78,"I think if the government is going to protect the public, I would think it's a bit of a joke. The government is trying to convince people to use their own research."

78,8,CANNOTANSWER has a few of those responses as well. The one with the most common is:
78,9,I don't think it's that hard to understand why people dislike the ACA. They are just skunks that used it.
78,13,I'm a lawyer. I'm not a lawyer. I'm a doctor.

78,29,No one needs a fucking mask to do it. You can't have the government go to a fucking fucking shitcon.
78,35,The issue is not that it is a joke. It is that it is trying to make people want to wear a mask and it is not being sarcastic.
78,37,"This is a joke. It’s a joke. And that’s not how it works. It’s a joke. It’s a joke, a joke, a joke."
78,38,>Is this the one who calls the ACA joke? Because I think a lot of people in this sub would be upset about this.
78,40,Nope. ACA is a joke.

78,46,It's a joke. It doesn't sound like the government is acting on it. It's not a joke.
78,52,You are being sarcastic and you don't understand what the point is? It sounds like a joke and you think it's a joke.
78,54,We are going to need a vaccination and a vaccine.
78,56,It is a joke and they're supposed to make it work.
78,58,What exactly does this joke really mean? It seems like it's a joke.
78,63,"""Wearing a mask helps in stopping the spread of a virus."
80,78,"Then the truth of the story is that I am not at all familiar with the NRA, and I am really disappointed."

90,78,"Then he's going to have to use the word ""skunk"" instead of ""hip""."
100,78,"Vaccination is a federal mandate. Unless your municipality prohibits it (which I assume is not something the CDC allows), your state has a law banning it. That is the point of vaccinations, and if you're vaccinated you're not required to wear a mask."

78,2,"It's very possible that the idea of a vaccine in the US is being slammed. I don't know how you feel about that, but if it is just a joke, it's not a joke at all. It's like someone making fun of the Bush Administration."
78,5,"...and that's not the point of the ACA, but it's what makes it so, so, so funny."
78,8,Those are the only answers. The ones I would put up with would be:
78,9,I don't understand the ACA's joke.
78,13,"Those are pretty general jokes I could think of, but it is a joke."
78,15,"""We are going to need a vaccine and a vaccine. It is not a joke. It’s a joke."""

78,54,"No way... I just want to know, what kind of joke you're talking about."
78,56,Those are all pretty damn good jokes. The ones about the ACA are more interesting than the ones about the ACA in general.
78,58,Yes. The ACA was passed as a joke.

90,78,The point of a skunk AMA is to make a person aware they are being harassed. But the point of a skunk AMA is to keep the school safe from all those negative things about it. I think that's a symptom of being unhygienic because you can't get in a position where you are under fire for being an asshole.
100,78,They don't have the government's right to make a list of all the things they don't mandate. The fact that it's only illegal in Texas is beyond me.

78,16,i want to know what kind of joke i'm talking about.
78,19,CANNOTANSWER](http://www.twitchingcon.org/) Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

78,29,"CANNOTANSWER : I think the whole ""It's not a joke"" part of the joke is that the ACA isn't the joke."
78,35,I think there's some more elaboration coming. It's a lot like how sarcasm makes people happy.
78,37,">I have never thought that if people had a problem with something that was ""fun"" or anything else they would not get the message. If they are getting the message, then it's funny."
78,38,I'm the same guy.

78,52,I think the whole thing is funny.
78,54,"I think the government is making jokes in order to distract people. They should have done something like this if they don't want to get into the argument that people should not be in the ACA, because the bill would just not be the best."
78,56,There's a joke in the book.
78,58,CANNOTANSWER:... I think it's a joke because I'm a fan of the ACA and I am a fan of the ACA.
78,63,"The first person speaker says that the fact that people get AIDS from wearing a mask is a serious problem, and I don't think it's a joke at all. I just think it's just a joke, and the point of the ACA is to prevent people from getting sick."

82,78,They're suing the health care reform movement because they're worried that the government is working against them and they want to keep it as a criminal offence.
90,78,I don’t really like this movie.

101,78,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
78,2,"It is a joke because it doesn't help people get sick in the long run, and it's a joke because it's a joke because people who do it don't know that it's being passed by the US are getting sick."
78,5,The ACA is a joke. It is a joke.
78,8,CANNOTANSWER.
78,9,What I mean is that the mask and its implication to prevent the spread of the disease are pretty offensive to me.

78,15,"It's called the ""It's a joke"" because of the humor and the way it's done."
78,16,I can't tell what a joke is.
78,19,AIDS does spread by a large margin. A virus is transmitted by blood. People aren't doing it for fun or anything to stop it.

78,29,"No one was joking about it, but the joke still has a point."

78,37,CANNOTANSWER:
78,38,"I'm going to say: It's funny that people with AIDS don't wear a mask, as a joke, but when a mask is deemed useless, it is a joke."
78,40,"If you're gonna say this, the president's been in Congress for six years, and in office in Washington, DC, for over three years. This ACA has come to power in Washington because a lot of people didn't know that."
78,42,The ACA is a joke. But not a joke.
78,46,Its kind of ridiculous. But it is a joke. We are being denigrated and the'serious' ACA is a joke.
78,52,I don't really know what joke is to you.
78,54,"People are doing the right thing, like getting a new helmet and getting a new vaccine. But they don't wear masks in public. There's no reason they'd want to bring that up.

78,63,"The ACA is a joke, but it's a joke, just like the ACA."
80,78,No one's going to give you the info you want from the article. The article is supposed to be a joke about the government. You haven't been told the truth.
82,78,"''I don't want to wear a mask outside of a public place because I don't want to take it in public but it doesn't have any physical properties outside of the car'', ''I would be super tempted to go with the current law'', ''I do think it's a problem because people believe in it and don't know about it. They're worried that the government is working against them and they want to keep it as a criminal offence."
90,78,"> ""I'm pretty sure the ""Skunk AMA"" is a joke that the AMA was in response to a joke, not a question or answer. I know the people who got skunks, but I'm not sure what I'm going to be talking about here. This is a very sad case and I'm upset that the government has been campaigning to change the ACA so it's a bad idea to wear the mask in public places like schools."
100,78,"This is a red flag, because it was a bad deal in Texas. The US has the same kind of policies as most other countries. Vaccination is a federal mandate that can be enforced, but doesn't have a mandate, like in the UK. The only difference is that they were mandated."
101,78,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
78,2,"As a person who has seen it, and has had it, I cannot agree that the ACA is a joke."

78,15,"If you want a new ACA in school, go to one."
78,16,"i think they need to repeal it asap, which I doubt i would do."
78,19,The fact that a new one can be made without a mask is a pretty solid argument.

78,15,"“I'm in the medical school of my university, and I think it's a good idea.”"

78,19,"I'm really not sure why you're being sarcastic, but i feel like people are just making jokes because they're not really serious about the ACA. It's one of the many reasons why people don't get it."
78,26,I read it in the English dictionary. It's a very well known fact. The ACA was repealed a year before the presidential elections. The ACA was repealed in 2012.
78,29,"The issue is with that. The ACA is the answer to the issue and not the way you should be. I would be upset about the ACA, and not have a conversation about the ACA if I'm going to the Twitchcon."
78,35,The ACA is the only one that isn't a joke.
78,37,"I can't imagine what this is supposed to mean, but it certainly seems like the one hand policy isn't that effective - or even helpful, in the face of the fact that it's being enforced by the government. There is an entire subreddit dedicated to ""Finishing"" the topic. I'm assuming that's not true."
78,38,"I've been going to TWitchCon for 3 weeks now and I've just had a bad time noticing the sarcasm here. It's a shame, because I've never thought I'd get out of here when I'm reading it, I've found that I have."

78,54,"The ACA is not a joke, but is a joke."
78,56,I'm not sure how the law would have worked if it had not been repealed. What the president is suing is really irrelevant to the overall situation.
78,58,It's been so long that I'm not sure what this new trend would be about.
78,63,The ACA was repealed because there aren't enough people who wear them. This is just a joke.
80,78,It's a joke because it's a joke. And the government is trying to get the government to take it out on people. The government is trying to get the public to take it out on people who aren't in the business of protecting the public.
82,78,"I'm just being a dumb ass, but I think the EPA is doing a good job at breaking the laws that help the people on the ground and helping the environment."

78,5,The president is going to cite the ACA as the reason the ACA isn't a joke.
78,8,".,., "
78,9,What is a joke? It's a joke because it protects people. It's a joke because it protects them from the dangers of HIV/AIDS. It's a joke because it's an attempt to stomp the drums of the world - it's not a joke because it is a joke because it's a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke because it is a joke.
78,13,"The ACA was repealed because there were no people in the US who got the vaccine. This is the real problem. It's a joke, and the federal government can't repeal it."
78,15,CANNOTANSWER:
78,16,The problem with the ACA is that it's a joke and it doesn't make sense for the CDC to repeal it. Certainly not to stop people from getting sick and getting a vaccine.
78,19,I think that's why the ACA isn't an effective joke.
78,26,">If the ACA was repealed, the ACA would not have had a significant effect on the people who were getting AIDS."
78,29,"I have heard these jokes before, and I think I understand what they mean. I like it when people joke about it because it's a good idea, but I don't want to be the one to think it's a joke. The idea is ridiculous, because it doesn't. The ACA was repealed as a joke because it doesn't really help stopping the spread of the virus."
78,35,It's a joke.
78,37,"What does the government really mean? ""It's really a joke, the only way that any joke can be considered a joke is if the government is trying to make it so that there are more people doing it."
78,38,"This is an excellent point. I can't imagine what the president would have done if it were repealed. If it was repealed, the ACA would have been implemented."
78,40,"The president is suing the ACA in order to put a new policy in place in order to change the way people are being treated in the country, and I doubt a couple people on the internet could understand that. I can't tell if this is a joke, but it's a joke."
78,42,CANNOTANSWER and a hater of a joke are the two people who seem to have the same issue.
78,46,I'm getting a sense of sarcasm from people who don't like the ACA.
78,52,"I can't think of any specific jokes from the article that would be funny and not like that in the sense that it's not a joke or it's just a joke. It could have been a joke. I think the ACA is a joke, but the fact that it was repealed as a joke is just a joke."
78,54,It's been 2 years since we've had a national joke!
78,56,"The whole thing is funny. Clearly, you aren't serious and you aren't the one to make it a joke. What the president is suing is really irrelevant to the overall situation."
78,58,This is a very common misunderstanding. People would do the same thing when they have no idea what they're talking about. People who don't really understand the ACA.
78,63,CANNOTANSWER is an anti-obama nut who likes to complain to the government about the ACA and is referring to the lack of the ACA. The ACA was repealed in 2012 because of a joke. The joke was designed to stop the spread of a virus and the government wanted to make the idea of people who wear a mask work.
80,78,It's one of those things where the law is wrong and the government is trying to get the government to take it out on people.
82,78,A mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
90,78,"CANNOTANSWER : ''Is this a good thing, but this is a good thing? I'm upset that the government has been campaigning to change the ACA so it's a bad idea to wear a mask in public places like schools. ''"
100,78,Vaccination is illegal because of the fact it isn't mandated in Texas. It's not the ACA that is enforceable.
101,78,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
78,2,People on a blog post about a bill passed by congress saying that people need to wear a mask in order to keep their nose from scrubbing up their noses when they have a virus.
78,5,"I think this is the main point of the ACA. I do not know if the ACA is a joke or a joke. I'm just wondering if it's in a broader context than the other comments. I guess this is not a joke. This is the president suing the ACA, which seems very regressive."
78,8,I think it's a joke because the whole idea isn't real and the government is trying to make it seem like a joke. There's nothing real about it.
78,9,Its actually just an attempt at stomping the drums of the world.
78,13,"They supposedly are being trying to force people to go on a sick leave with the new ACA, but that's not the real issue here. They have to take all the people who actually did the right thing, the government and all the government. I think they should do the same."
78,15,"It is a joke because people are talking about the ACA, and not just about the government."
78,16,The one hand policy was meant to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS. The ACA was repealed because it was intended to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS.
78,19,"I think we're going to have to agree with you that they should take on the risks of an infectious disease, but as you have said they should take the risk of getting vaccinated."
78,26,"I think the most important thing is to say the name of the campaign, which is why this article got such huge interest."
78,29,"I'm in the US for a business. Is this the ACA, the health care Act, or something?"
78,35,I just found a way to take the joke of a vaccine. Its not a joke. I was trying to convince someone that it was just a joke. It's not a joke. It's a joke.
78,37,People say 'We are going to get a new gov't to fix the ACA. The government is going to need to change it.'
78,38,... and the fact that the president is suing the ACA to get a new policy in place in order to change the way people are being treated in the country.
78,40,It was a joke when it came out in 2012.
78,42,I think you're going to get the complete opposite response if you are 'twitching' about this issue.

78,56,"I'm not saying that the joke is not funny or anything. It's just a joke, and the fact that it isn't the same as the ACA is just a little over the top. The joke is about the government trying to repeal the ACA, not the policy itself."
78,58,"This joke is in a satire of ""How does it make his breath come out of the back of his head""?"
78,63,I think this is a funny joke.
80,78,I see a lot of interesting points about this post here:
82,78,"The CDC and the EPA haven’t gotten any results from that article, but I don’t know how to make a public health care policy about people getting sick if they do something dangerous."
90,78,A person who does not know that they are being misled by the government and wants to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS can go to the NRA.
100,78,"TIL: The article is about the government enforcing the federal mandate for vaccinations, in addition to a mandate to not have a vaccinated person come to TwitchCon."
101,78,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."

78,13,I think it is important to point out that I think the ACA is a joke and that I don't know what the actual issue is.

78,35,This guy has made a good point.
78,37,"There's a lot of things that are funny to me, but there's no funny joke that is going to stop people getting sick if they do something dangerous or not."
78,38,"I was just thinking that. It makes sense that this is a joke, and it has to be made to get people to look at it."
78,40,Apparently the ACA is the answer to a lot of problems of being on a war crime website. You're a joke. A joke is a joke. A joke is a joke. A joke is a joke.
78,42,"No, the problem is the government implementing the ACA to prevent the spread of the virus."
78,46,"In all fairness, the whole issue of this satire is a joke, it's a good joke - it's a joke that isn't funny at all."
78,52,"A skunk would be an idiot to have a joke about a terrorist if they are able to get in the US without them. I mean, that was one of the things that came up with it: The people who did not vote for it were people who did not like the ACA. It was just a joke."

78,56,"If you don't agree that the ACA is a joke, I think you're being over-the-top."
78,58,I think the idea that the ACA is a joke is a joke. The idea that people need to wear a mask is a joke. But it's a joke. It's a joke.
78,63,"I've said that some people are funny, but others are stupid."
80,78,The point of 'I don't want to live in a country where I'm a doctor' is to be in a country with no policing system to prevent spread of virus.'

78,8,The ACA is a joke based on the fact that people who wear masks are essentially being the victims of some of the government's attempts to sabotage the federal government.
78,9,It's a joke because it's a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke.
78,13,"As someone who doesn't get why a joke is a joke, I believe this is a joke."

78,16,> It sounds like the government wants to stop it and that the first thing they do is make it mandatory for people to have a helmet in public.
78,19,"What's worse is that people who don't have a helmet will not get vaccinated, but people who don't have a mask will not get sick, and if there is no vaccine then they will be a scumbag."

78,37,Vaccines work very well if they aren't all over the place despite the fact that they aren't used unless there is an emergency response. I suspect it's because the ACA repealed a lot of bad things and he isn't trying to save the health of others.
78,38,"In the ACA case, Obama and his supporters of the ACA 'just admonished it.' And they've made the point that while it's a joke, it's also a joke.

78,9,No. That's just a joke. It's a joke because it protects people. It's a joke because it prevents the spread of a virus.

78,5,It's a joke.
78,8,"The word ""joke"" seems to be synonymous with 'funny' as in 'funny.'"
78,9,I have a copy of the title and a copy of the comments. I would love to go to the ACA's congress and find out why they said that they would stop a fucking joke about it and repeal it.
78,13,ACA repealed because of the lack of insurance against HIV/AIDS
78,15,"It's been said a few times that if the government acted to repeal it it would be a joke. The only other way around this joke is to get people to wear masks.

78,54,What is the joke about the ACA being repealed?
78,56,I have seen the ACA written and said by people who do it a lot in the past and it's one of the worst things ever. I'm an ACA hater and I think I'm going to leave.

78,2,[i] m an anti-vaccine troll and i think the whole thing is 'It seems to make the ACA work'

The government isn't interested in the ACA because it's the only thing that would be a joke if it was repealed. It's a joke because it's a joke.
78,8,CANNOTANSWER.
78,9,The point of the ACA isn't that it's a joke. The purpose of the ACA is to prevent the spread of AIDS. It's a joke because it prevents the spread of the disease and makes people feel safe.
78,13,"The entire point of the ACA is to prevent the spread of AIDS, which is the main thing that makes it a joke."
78,15,If they can't get the government to repeal it they can't get people to wear a mask because it makes them sick.

78,35,This is a pretty good example of the underlying idea.
78,37,"""We're going to get a new gov't to fix the ACA. The ACA was repealed because there was no medical exemption against HIV/AIDS."""
78,38,What is the point of a joke if you don't even have a prescription? Isn't it a joke if you don't have a prescription?
78,40,"I'm in the US military and I've heard a lot of these comments. But no, a mask is not a joke."
78,42,I am very confused as to why this is a joke.

78,54,"The ACA is a joke, and people aren't allowed to get a vaccine if they don't wear it in public. The ACA is a joke because it is the only thing that would be a joke if it were repealed, which 'has nothing to do with ACA repealing'."
78,56,"Why would anyone want to see that? I'm sorry, I'm not serious, but it's just that the ACA is a joke. I think the ACA is the only thing that works to prevent AIDS and prevent it from spread. The only way the ACA works is because it doesn't. But, it doesn't really make any sense, and it isn't going to do anything to stop AIDS."
78,58,"The joke is about the ACA, the ACA isn't a joke, the joke is about why people are going to go on that vacation without wearing it."

90,78,"""[The ACA] is about a lack of a political agenda.'''"
100,78,Vaccination is a mandate that is only legally enforceable in Texas. I agree that a vaccinated person does not have to wear a mask at an event because they don't want to be a scumbag. This is a bad idea.
101,78,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
78,2,"I think if there's a vaccine, then people could have a chance to get vaccinated as well."
78,5,"CANNOTANSWER: 'We need to ban the use of the mask in public, and they are not allowed to do so is really telling. The problem isn't the mask. In general, if the problem isn't the mask, then I will be happy that this joke is''."
78,8,What do you think about the ACA if it works in your state?
78,9,The ACA repealed because there was no medical exemption against HIV/AIDS. It wasn't repealed because of the ACA.
78,13,The ACA was repealed because there was no medical exemption against HIV/AIDS. The ACA isn't going to end well for most people in the US.
78,15,ACA repealed because there was no medical exemption against HIV/AIDS. The US does have a system that uses a mask and doesn't allow people who are at risk to use it in public.
78,16,Vaccination is the name of a new ACA that is just about to be repealed. It's the name of a new legislation that's been passed in a number of different ways since 2002 and has been used by the United States to get rid of a lot of problems that the Obama administration has had.
78,19,ACA repealed as part of the anti-virus act.

78,29,No joke in the world. The whole idea is a joke.
78,35,I mean - what's the point?

78,38,"No I think it's an interesting problem with the ACA, if they haven't repealed it they could have repealed it. They have to do this because it's a joke."
78,40,I mean the ACA was not a joke.

101,78,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
78,2,"I'm a lawyer in a psychiatric institution, I just think it's so weird that I would have to wear my own mask in public."
