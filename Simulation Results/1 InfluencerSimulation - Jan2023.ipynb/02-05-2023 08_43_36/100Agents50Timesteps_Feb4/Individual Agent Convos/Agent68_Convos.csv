68,3,"Well, the whole issue of what you need to wear a mask to protect yourself has been the same for several presidents in the past, and we are going to have a lot of problems in the future because of that."

98,68,"No one has said that before, but I can say that they are just as sexist as Donald J. Trump was."

68,46,"I think it is the wrong answer here. The fact that she is wearing a mask is pretty much the same as someone not wearing a helmet. If the game isn't allowed to have a helmet with the weapon, she needs to wear it and be protected with it. It seems like the government has decided to start talking about that."

68,59,A man wearing a mask isn't a white person. He is a female. he is not a man.
68,60,I think he's having a good moment.

96,68,"What does the helmet say when you wear it,? Are they wearing a mask or a hoodie? Do you know why this is a topic on the front page? Because a helmet is necessary to prevent the spread of the virus, and you do not have to wear a helmet to prevent the spread of it.

68,35,"This isn't stupid either. I don't understand how this article makes any sense unless you read the article. I'm pretty sure it's about the government's mandatory masks, not about them.

68,38,"That's a really good point. What I am saying is: wearing a mask is just as necessary as not wearing a helmet, because I think if the people wearing a mask aren't getting it, they're just being more sexy. I think the point of a mask is to shield you from the infection and it's not a requirement to wear one."
68,39,"The guy was just making fun of his lack of security and the fact he is not allowed to get the protection. I thought it was a remark about a helmet as much as his failure to get a shirt, pants and boots."

68,11,I don't think it's a joke. But the point of a mask is to prevent it from spreading.
68,14,The movie is interesting to read and it's not just about the military. The actors are the one who aren't necessarily talking about the government if they're talking about it.

It's more that they wouldn't actually get involved because they have to worry about making the players feel uncomfortable or insecure about making a joke based on something not very relevant.
