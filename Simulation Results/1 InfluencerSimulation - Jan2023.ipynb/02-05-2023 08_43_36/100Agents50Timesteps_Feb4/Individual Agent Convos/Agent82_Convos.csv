91,82,I don't have much experience wearing a mask. I have had 2 different experiences with masks.
82,4,"Using the word 'facial' and the word'sensitive' to refer to the same thing as 'weaving a mask'. I'm not sure what is the correct one. Usually my first experience with a mask is if my boobs were in their mouth, I'd just feel as if they were in a mask. But this one's my favorite. I'd have to change my hair so that the boobs could get out of my face."
82,5,There's a funny little trick called wearing a mask outside a car when a virus hits your car. The trick is to wear a mask outside your car so that the virus can't get out from behind you.
82,10,Is a mask in your car a safe?
82,18,"I don't want to wear a mask outside or in my car alone. If I'm on my phone, I don't have a way to call me ""gullible and submissive."" I don't want to wear a mask outside or in my car alone. I want to call you a gullible and submissive, not a gullible, not a submissive. I do have a way of asking if you don't understand me."

82,28,"I know a man who isn't gullible and submissive, but I've learned to say it's important for his safety. He shouldn't be able to 'feel' his breath coming out of his car, just a mask."
82,35,You know I don't get it. I'm not gullible but I'm gullible and submissive. I don't get it.
82,37,A lot of people in the U.S. are not immune to a virus.
82,42,Wearing a mask outside is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
82,46,"I wear a mask outside in my car. It's a mask with no fucking sense of humour, which is a bit disconcerting. Then I go outside in the morning and I'm so tired. But then I get out of the car. I can't seem to think of a way to fix my bad shit."
82,50,If I'm the one on the other side of the road I'm going to wear the mask for a week and I don't know about that I'll say I've already put up with the whole thing.
82,78,It seems that the government is allowing the person wearing the mask to wear anything outside of the car in the car.
82,79,I can only imagine how this guy would feel in a mask if she were wearing a mask outside and in her car. I'm in my early 20's and have never had any issues with my skin but I'm sure there are ways to get my teeth cleaned and things like that.
91,82,I've had both. In some states there is a helmet requirement.
82,4,Then you'd have to change your hair so that the boobs could get out of your face.
82,5,What is your first experience with wearing a mask?
82,10,I feel so bad about wearing a mask in the car. I've never had an issue.
82,18,I am a gullible and submissive woman. I'm a gullible and submissive woman.
82,24,"In the UK, you can wear a mask as a courtesy, just as you can wear a robe while traveling. It's not a mask, but it's part of the measures. It's also a mandatory accessory, and you may have to wear it while driving to avoid being pushed out by a virus. If you want to know if you should wear a robe, you may also need a safety vest."
82,27,YMMV. It's been a few days since I've been wearing the mask outside in my car. So I'm looking forward to getting my teeth cleaned out. It would be hard to work it out.
82,28,"I'm a bit of a nerd, but I'm not stupid enough to go out on a limb."
82,35,"In my experience, wearing a mask outside is not a crime. I've never had a 'fucking sense of humour', but I know you can still yell at me to ""please give me a ride - I'm going to make it a point to come here."""
82,37,"Yes, I have this! I don't care about being 'gullible' and submissive. I don't care what's important. I want to wear a mask and the right kind of protection I need."
82,42,I work at a park and we get sick and we have to take the car with us to the park. We can't make it up to our sitters with them until it gets to the park.
82,46,It's not going to stop you from noticing what your driving like if you don't have your car on and on it. You'll just have to go to a doctor and see what you need to be doing. Whether you will want to wear a mask in your car is up to you.

82,79,"I wear a mask in my car to prevent the spread of viruses. I'm not in a blimp. I've been snoozing for a few years. I was never a bulimic, but I did feel like I had a very special bond with the folks in my car that I used to have when I was a teenager. My mom told me about it in an episode of The Office."
91,82,"If you look at the caption, and you're referring to an AMA/TAX in a comment in the news, you'll notice that the title says 'We're going to have to change our policies to allow a more uniform based on that'."
82,4,"The ""Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."""
82,5,In '08 it is not a crime for a doctor to make a prescription for a helmet when you go for a ride in the UK.
82,10,"I think that you're a bit dumb about how you are actually a gullible and submissive woman. But, what you're saying is, your comment seems to be based on a fucking bit of a TAX statement that says a less stricter policy than what you are actually saying, and is not a factual statement."
82,18,"If you're wearing a mask outside in your car with a sick person on you, it's not a crime."
82,24,"As an American who is in the US, I don't understand the whole concept of a mask in the US."
82,27,"I think it was a lot more than just the ''I don't wear a mask outside in my car, so that I can't get my teeth cleaned out'', but it's what I think they want to do to protect us from viruses."
82,28,Wearing a mask outside is not a crime. It seems that the government is allowing the person wearing a mask to wear anything outside of the car in the car.
82,35,"Nope, I'm just a very smart, very funny, and super-sensical guy. I'm not interested in making fun of this stupid guy...I'm interested in this weird guy...I'm not interested in this guy...I'm interested in his sense of humor."
82,37,It's not a crime.
82,42,What is your first experience with wearing a mask outside in the car?
82,46,"Wearing a mask outside is a crime. In the US you can wear a mask outside, but not in a car."
82,50,"It sounds like they may have misrepresented the concept, and it isn't as obvious as it is he might have misrepresented it, but he could still be seen wearing it outside of his car."
82,78,"I can't imagine how people feel about people who wear masks outside of their cars if they get sick, unless they are trying to keep it from happening in their own cars."
82,79,"I'm assuming that the mask was invented as a way to prevent the spread of a virus? I mean it could easily be found outside of a vehicle, even in your car, which can be found in a car if you are snoozing at night. If you're in the right place, then you can always put a mask in your car, but it can also have a visor."
91,82,It's really easy to get stung by the government and they don't actually have the ability to fix it.
82,4,">As an American who is in the US, I think that you're a bit dumb about how you are actually a gullible and submissive woman."
82,5,I'm curious what you think of the fact that wearing a mask outside isn't a crime?
82,10,The government should probably just be a bit clearer. You have the right to be as ignorant as they want to.
82,18,I think you are joking... But I guess you have a sense of humor and respect.
82,24,"I don't think a mugging is as bad as being a medical professional's opinion on the matter, but I can understand why people think it's weird to wear a mask in their car, which is basically what they are trying to say."
82,27,"I don't think it's that easy. If you have a car with a mask that has a roof, and you take it off at night, it's an unsafe place to have it with a car roof. It's not a problem for a person with a helmet, but a common problem when the person is not in a car. In the US, it isn't a crime to have a mask in the car."
82,28,I think it's hard to believe that this is even a question. There isn't a law on the books regarding this.
82,35,I've also never seen a person wear a mask outside of their car.
82,37,IANAL. I'm from the US and I haven't smoked in a long time so I'm not sure about yours but this is a great way to be seen.
82,42,"In the UK, you can wear a mask outside, but not in a car."
82,46,A mask does not stop people from seeing a dick in a car. A person wearing it in a car can not stop them from seeing a dick in a car. You can't tell the difference between wearing a mask outside and outside.
82,50,I wouldn't wear a mask in my car. I can't wear one in my car.
82,78,They're not going to change their policies that prevent that from happening. Especially since they won't.
82,79,It is not a crime in the US to wear a mask outside of a vehicle. It's a crime.
91,82,"You're the one making the point of the post. You're trying to prove the point, but I'm trying to prove your point."
82,4,"'Wearing a mask outside, but not in a car, isn't a crime.'"
82,5,"Yes. If the government is getting their way by wearing a mask in their car, it would be a crime. You're joking, but you can't prove anything. I don't think it's weird to wear a mask in the car, but you can't make sure it's not in the car."
82,10,IMO this is one of the most important parts of our conversation.
82,18,My cousin was a member of a group who used to wear a mask. It was to prevent the spread of a virus.
82,24,It doesn't actually stop the spread of a virus.
82,27,They're the police. They're the people to punish. And they're the people to do this. It's their job to help the nutcase.
82,28,Wearing a mask outside is a crime in the US.
82,35,The only problem with this is how much of the people who disagree with you have to say something that seems a little off. I'm not sure if people are really going to stop this but it is not a crime.
82,37,"That's not the joke. It's the fact that you think it's weird to wear a mask outside, but you don't know how to say that."
82,42,They have a troll.
82,46,"This is a good way to start off. You can wear a mask outside of your car, but you can't wear a mask in your car. You can wear a mask outside, but you can't wear a mask inside of a car."
82,50,I’m assuming that the mask was invented as a way to prevent the spread of a virus?
82,78,I'm a doctor who's been in the military and have had my head tattooed off with a mask.
82,79,What? Because the government is already in the way to stop spread of a virus.
91,82,I am so happy for ya but it really doesn't seem that much like a good argument to me. This is like saying that the EPA should make a change for the sake of the skunks.
82,4,We're not supposed to wear a mask in the car.
82,5,"""A mask does not stop people from seeing a dick in a car. A person wearing it in a car can not stop them from seeing a dick in a car.

82,10,You know what's important about the post? Your point that the government is helping protect the nutcase. Is that it.

82,24,"I don't understand why people think it's weird to wear a mask in their car, which is basically what they are trying to say."
82,27,I think it's more like saying that EPA should make a change for the sake of the skunks.
82,28,"The only problem is the government is not getting their way, and it's almost certainly not a crime in the US."
82,35,You are in a shitstorm. The government has nothing to do with it.
82,37,"No, it's not a crime."
82,42,>They have a troll.'
82,46,I don't think it's an issue that the government would make a change that prevents it.
82,50,"We're just joking. We can't prevent a virus from spreading outside of the car or anything, so this is just a piece of shit to do."
82,78,It sounds like a nice way to use your phone for that type of discussion.
82,79,smh. that's the simplest and most common way to say a thing afaik.
91,82,It's really easy to get stung by the government and they don't actually have the ability to fix it. It's really easy to get stung by the government and they don't have the ability to fix it.
82,4,Nope. It's a joke.
82,5,"I just read the post and saw the title and thought, ""I think it's strange that people think it's weird to wear a mask in the car."""
82,10,"I was rebutting a snarky OP to make a reference to ""I am so happy for ya but it really doesn't seem that much like a good argument to me."""
82,18,What's the purpose of a mask?
82,24,"Because they have a 'good' job and have to pay the bills. So why not just wear a mask outside, in your car, while driving, without it?"
82,27,"It seems like we should do this. What are the benefits of wearing a mask outside or in a car? Besides the fact that it’s not dangerous, it doesn’t make the government a bad place to get a skunk in a car."
82,28,"It isn't a crime in the US, it's a good way to start a conversation. There are plenty of people in the US who aren't gullible and submissive. It seems the only way the government is getting their way is to tell people they need to go outside their car to shit themselves."
82,35,You're just an idiot. I don't believe you. I'm assuming that the government has a troll and you're not joking. It's not a crime.
82,37,i know exactly why it is funny
82,42,I'm not even joking.
82,46,"It's also an issue that the government has no ability to solve, if any, and is making a mistake because they don't know how to solve the problem. It's a bad idea to say anything when people aren't doing it."
82,50,So how do you put this? They don't know if the virus is spreading outside of your car or if a person can't see it outside of their car?
82,78,The mask in question isn't an issue with the EPA or the government. This is not a matter of the EPA granting a waiver from the EPA if the person is wearing a mask outside of their car to keep their head in the car. The government does not have any power to prevent this.
82,79,I don't like the fact that you say it but I think it's more of a jerk-jerk thing that the government has no problem changing their policies.
91,82,He said that he doesn't understand why the EPA or NRA don't have authority to change the health care system. That is why he's saying skunks aren't the most effective protection against a virus.
82,4,The government is putting more resources into helping people and not inflicting such abuse on a community.
82,5,"[NAME] has been on the Internet for years, but now he's on the internet for all of these."

82,24,"What is the EPA saying? Its not a criminal act, but it's an ethical thing to do. I can't imagine why the US has that attitude towards them."
82,27,It's weird to wear a mask outside while driving.
82,28,"I don't know. I think you're going to a conversation on why people like it, because I do know that people in the US are gullible and submissive. This isn't a crime, because people who like this stuff don't think it's a crime, because they think that people are so gullible and submissive. And people who want to get a virus because they think it's a big deal, that they're trying to try to get someone out of their house, and that's not an issue."

82,46,Why do they wear a mask in cars?
82,50,"That's the only way to really go. I've learned this since I was a child, and I don't see why he's so disinterested in this idea. But the answer is that the government is a bit clingy. You're right."
82,78,"This is what I was talking about. I'm assuming the government has some real skunk-friendly opinions. Unless the government is claiming to be ""a bunch of shit"", it's still illegal in the US."
82,79,You're making a very important point here:
91,82,"So that you can't get stung by the government because they aren't responsible for the health care system, and you can't be blamed for the government?"
82,4,Is it a crime to wear a mask in the car? Because that is not how they are supposed to get away with a virus in the car.

91,82,CANNOTANSWER: People in America should get the EPA to get rid of the federal government. They can fire people who don't comply with the regulations and would be fired for violating them.
82,4,You know that if someone is really into the skunk problem and the government thinks that they are in an ethical relationship then I wouldn't consider it a crime to do it.

82,10,"That's not a problem, but I do get why people should get the EPA to fire people for violating the EPA."
82,18,It's a crime. Whether or not it is illegal is another matter. The law prohibits skunks from wearing a mask outside or in their car. This is actually against the law. It's against the law.
82,24,The truth is that the EPA doesn't support that.
82,27,EPA doesn't have a criminal license and does not want to allow the use of a hazardous gas mask.
82,28,"The CDC just told the same thing, and they did a good job. I would just keep looking up the rules and trying to do what they are supposed to do."

82,35,The federal government is going to fire anyone who violates the law. The EPA is not a crime.
82,37,"You need to be careful with what you do, because you will have the risk of dying or dying of a skunk problem."
82,42,"I think the issue is that the mask in the article is illegal and therefore illegal. The fact that it is illegal to be wearing a mask outside is unfounded. I know that is not the case, but I can't think of any specific reason to say it is a crime to do it."
82,46,The fact that they can fire people for violating the federal laws is another example of the government's failure to implement a program that would prevent skunks from using their cars.
82,50,"I'm from the Midwest. But there are some pretty big problems with the government. I'm not a big fan of the NSA or EPA, but I think there's a lot of good discussion going on here about what was illegal."
82,78,"I don't know why you're being downvoted for this, but your example was pretty much a straight-up skunk. :D"
82,79,i'm sure you have a lot of issues with your teeth cleaning and things like that. i think it's funny that people think the nahilism of wearing a mask on a highway is part of the skunk problem.
91,82,They are skunks. The government has a lot of responsibilities if you say so.
82,4,I do not want to read the entire article in all of its dozens of variations.
82,5,"You've gone to a fair bit of a disadvantage with this one, but I don't think it's an issue."
82,10,Why does it sound like a joke based on a snarky OP?
82,18,"This shit was never that bad for people, it wasn't that bad for a guy."
82,24,I'm from California and I agree with your point. It is not a crime to wear a mask. It is a crime to smoke if you do it in public without your permission.
82,27,The EPA can fire someone for violating the laws and if you don't get a job with them they will be in prison for a year or two.
82,28,It's part of the anti-virus epa's responsibilities and it's not just a crime.
82,35,I'm not gonna do a lot of stupid stuff like that for you guys but I'll do my best to keep it as close to a public public address as possible. But I'd like to say I'm very happy that I'm putting my best foot forward for your skunk problem.
82,37,"Honestly, they are so stupid and dangerous. It's so obvious that it's a bad idea for them to fire anyone for violating the laws. 'Still I don't get the point of the article' and make it look like it was wrong because of it's arbitrary nature."
82,42,I would call it 'a piece of shit to do'.
82,46,The only thing I see on the EPA is that they are violating the anti-virus laws of our country and they do not have a criminal license.
82,50,"""I'm sure you have a lot of issues with your teeth cleaning and things like that."
82,78,"""It seems that the government is allowing the person wearing the mask to wear anything outside of the car in the car."
82,79,"""We're not doing something about it. We're just not doing something about it."""
91,82,I think the NRA is the government that does not understand the AMA/TAX.
82,4,It says that wearing a mask outside is not a crime. It says that it is a crime to smoke if you do it in public without your permission.
82,5,"I'm a huge fan of the EPA's'reckless' policies, but I am an EPA official and I'm very passionate about the issues involved. I can't stand the 'free' rules that the EPA and the CDC provide."
82,10,"I agree with you about the TAX, but that's not my point. I think it's a good idea to fire people because of the TAX."
82,18,"I don't know about the other replies but I do know that it seems to me that in some places, a person may be on a sluggish path if they don't have a criminal license and can be fired for violating a law."
82,24,The only reason i can agree with that is because i have a lot of issues with my teeth cleaning and stuff like that.
82,27,"They are a bad thing and should be removed from all public vehicles, but they don't want to be a bad thing. The EPA is a bad idea but they should be fired."
82,28,I don't like skunks. I don't care if they try to make me look good. I'll be very upset if you put me in a skunk pose.
82,35,"It's a crime in the US to wear a mask outside a public place, because it's dangerous to your health. I'm a big fan of NSA and EPA, but I think that I'm in a big shitstorm about something."
82,37,It's part of the anti-virus responsibilities.
82,42,"A very good point. If you are willing to admit that your work is not a good place for this, then the government might not be in the right. The EPA might not be able to make a change that isn't that effective. You should probably think about the EPA."
82,46,"""I don't think it's an issue that the government has no ability to solve, if any, and is making a mistake because they don't know how to solve the problem."""
82,50,oh man that is a good point.
82,78,"This is what I'm talking about. I think the government has some real skunk-friendly opinions. Unless the government is claiming to be ""a bunch of shit"", it's still illegal in the US."
82,79,Is this a satire from a book about the government. Or is it from a movie?
91,82,I don't know why anyone is calling that a good argument but this is not a good one.
82,4,I would fire people for wearing a mask outside.
82,5,"""I'm a huge fan of the EPA and I'm very passionate about the issues involved. I think it's a good idea to fire people because of the TAX. It says that wearing a mask outside is not a crime. It says that it is a crime to smoke if you do it in public without your permission."
82,10,"People who have been in the environment are not getting fired because they don't have the mental capacity to do that, even though that's the case with the EPA. It's a crime in the US to wear a mask outside a public place because it's dangerous to their health."
82,18,"""I don't want to wear a mask outside or in my car alone."""
82,24,"What's the best way to prevent a person from wearing a mask outside? That's one of the great things about the government: that its a skunk problem, and that's what the federal government does with their masks."
82,27,"skunks are not considered to be a part of the government. They aren't just some bad thing, they are the people doing it."
82,28,Those are not the kinds of things that are allowed to go outside the car unless it's your own car.
82,35,">The only thing I see on the EPA is that they are violating the anti-virus laws of our country and they do not have a criminal license. ""I'm sure you have a lot of issues with your teeth cleaning and things like that. ""It seems that the government is allowing the person wearing the mask to wear anything outside of the car in the car."
82,37,"I don't think that there is a good reason to fire someone who doesn't wear a mask outside of the vehicle. The government's policies are a waste of money and money, but it doesn't make sense for the EPA to fire someone for doing so."
82,42,nsould i ask why no one is asking?
82,46,Is this a comedy or a book about the government?
82,50,>I think it's a good idea to fire people because of the TAX.

82,79,It is a crime to wear a mask outside a vehicle. It is a crime if they don't have a criminal license.
91,82,What I mean by skunks is that they can get stung by EPA.
82,4,The issue of the skunk is the masks and the government. They don't make it illegal.
82,5,"We have a lot of skunk laws, not to mention the entire thing is unconstitutional."
82,10,"""We're very aware that a lot of the things that are illegal in the US aren't actually illegal in the US."""
82,18,It is a crime to wear a mask outside a public place.
82,24,"Honestly if you wear a mask while driving and have issues with your teeth cleaning and stuff like that, you need to be fine."
82,27,>I think it's a good idea to fire people for wearing a mask outside.
82,28,I think there are plenty of people in the US who aren't gullible and submissive. I think it's a good way to start a conversation. There are plenty of people in the US who aren't gullible and submissive.
82,35,The fact that you can't wear a mask outside of your car is a different story.
82,37,I don't really care if anyone else is saying it. I'm just curious about the facts behind the law.
82,42,"The EPA's policy is not going to work. In fact, its not working. If EPA doesn't have a criminal license, then they probably could be fined for that."
82,46,This is a comedy or book about the government. It's basically the same thing. There is no law against it.
82,50,"I can tell you that in many instances, people don't actually go on a visit to the EPA and they don't wear masks in public."
82,78,[NAME] r/R-A-SII/Pool-Kids is trying to make this clear.
82,79,"I don't know who this is, but I think it's pretty easy to come off as ""sad"". I think this is a pretty broad term but you could also look for an article on how a skunks can be stung by a mask."
91,82,"This was written by a Republican. It's about how the government isn't doing anything to stop the spread of the disease, a big issue, and some cliches."
82,4,"It's not that I think the government is using violence against people, it's that I think it's better to stick to what they're doing than to try and work on making you feel safe and welcome in a workplace where you don't have to be in an environment where you aren't gonna get caught and will feel abused. It's not like you can't keep your cool because you know it's in your own home. It's not really a good idea to fire people for being able to get a fucking thing on you"
82,5,I think it's a good idea to fire people because of the TAX. It's a crime to wear a mask outside a public place.
82,10,What's the point of a tax?
82,18,I've read the article. It is an interesting read and I've been trying to read it for a while.
82,24,"I'm not sure why you were downvoted, it seems like this subreddit is making sense, considering that the question is a bit vague and cliche, and maybe not really relevant."
82,27,What you're trying to say is the EPA and the IRS are the ones trying to get things done.
82,28,>I'm a huge fan of the EPA and the CDC provide. I think it's a good idea to fire people because of the TAX. It's a crime in the US to wear a mask outside a public place.
82,35,They need to find a way to stop them from getting out of the car at a big fire.
82,37,The first article I read about the mask is really about the government's handling of the government's anti-virus policies.
82,42,Aaand... the issue of the skunk is the masks and the government. ''The issue of the skunk is the masks and the government. They don't make it illegal. ''They don't have a criminal license.
82,46,"There's a lot of discussion going on, and I want to talk about some of these things, but I can't do this in real life. I have a feeling that the first place people see is the US, not the US. You're right, I think a lot of people in that post are gullible and submissive, but if you really don't have that sort of mentality in your head, you don't see the point in the book."
82,50,"In my hometown, it's very common for skunks to get stung by the government. They also get stung by the EPA, which is pretty nasty, and I've had to go through a bunch of ""i'm sure you have a lot of issues with your teeth cleaning and stuff like that.'"" ""I can't be seen wearing a mask in my car."", ""That's the only way to really go. I've learned this since I was a child, and I've learned this since I was a t"
82,78,"No, but it is not illegal."
82,79,">It is a crime in the US to wear a mask outside a public place, because it's dangerous to your health. I'm a huge fan of the EPA and the CDC provide. I think it's a good idea to fire people because of the TAX."
91,82,EPA can fire people who don't comply with the regulations and would be fired for violating them.
82,4,It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. This is a comedy or book about the government. It's basically the same thing. There is no law against it.
82,5,"The most important thing to remember is that if someone asks you how long they will wear a mask in your car they might be answering ""No, it's not a crime if it's not a crime to smoke in public""."
82,10,"I can't say I've read a lot of EPA posts in the last couple days. I was like, “No. I didn't know what the EPA was doing. I can't even stand wearing a mask. I am not interested in what I did with my life.”"
82,18,"I grew up as a government employee and this was the first thing I knew, as an environmentalist who would tell me that ""I don't want to wear a mask outside or in my car alone is better than going outside alone."" and then the next thing I saw was a skunk being attacked by a skunk, and I'd just throw in the notion that ""if it was the same thing as a skunk, that would be the first thing I did."" and then I started to feel like my life had become more important and more important to me"
82,24,"I'm sure they have a 'good' job and have to pay the bills. So why not just wear a mask outside, in your car, while driving, without it?"""
82,27,"I don't understand why you're getting downvoted. Your comment has nothing to do with anything in this discussion, it's something that's a little less likely to get upvoted."
82,28,That's a big part of the reason for the federal government's decision not to fire people for this. I'm going to put out a few more of these comments.
82,35,It was not a crime to buy the mask or even to take part in a crime. It's illegal to wear it outside of the car to stop it from spreading inside the car.
82,37,People often have to make their own decisions about what they want to do in a public place.
82,42,This is the most common question about the US government.
82,46,"A mask is an anti-virus, but it isn't actually a part of the EPA's protection, or the government's protective measures."
82,50,"""This is a comedy or book about the government. It's basically the same thing. There is no law against it. I can tell you that in many instances, people don't actually go on a visit to the EPA and they don't wear masks in public."
82,78,I am so sorry this happened to you.
82,79,"I don't know, 'til I read the article. I'm just reading it now.'"
91,82,The article was just a rebuttal to the one on the EPA's part.
82,4,"The only reason for a law is to make sure they do it because there are no other laws in place in that country that will help the skunks. The government and the EPA will not stop the spread of the virus, which is an issue in the US."
82,5,You're being a delusional asshole.
82,10,"The main question is whether people believe the government is helping, or not, and not the government in general. You can be both and in a group or even in the same department, but the problem is that we don't have to be aware of the facts about how much the government can be hurt, as many don't."
82,18,"My skunk cousin actually had a joke when he asked me if I wore a mask in my car for hours and then left with a scar on her throat. I was kind of in a funk until we met, and I thought he said he had an accident while he was out putting the mask on."
82,24,">It is a crime in the US to wear a mask outside a public place, because it's dangerous to your health."
82,27,It's a bit of a rebuttal to the one on the government's part.
82,28,"EPA doesn't fire people for saying ""I don't want to wear a mask outside of a public place"""
82,35,I don't think it's a crime to wear a mask outside of a public place.
82,37,"""I don't want to be seen wearing a mask outside, but I don't know how to say that."""
82,42,"It isn't illegal, and is alson't criminal in some jurisdictions."
82,46,">It was not a crime to buy the mask outside, but not in a car. In my hometown, it's very common for skunks to get stung by the government."
82,50,I can't really remember what you were saying and I've heard the quote from a few people on the radio...
82,78,It's probably a very bad idea if there's a federal law that allows anyone to wear a mask without it.
82,79,I don't see anything you said that's not a crime or satire. This isn't about a person being stung. This is about the person being stung by a skunk.
91,82,[What I mean by skunks is that they can get stung by the government. They aren't responsible for the health care system. They can fire people who don't comply with the regulations and would be fired for violating them.](https://www.redskinsprofs.com/context_report.htm)
82,4,EPA & EPA are also putting more resources into helping people and not inflicting such abuse on a community. So they can fire people for wearing a mask outside. It isn't a crime to wear a mask in public.
82,5,"'I don't believe it's weird to wear a mask in a public place, but I think it's a good idea to fire people because of the TAX. It says that it is not a crime to wear a mask outside of a public place, but not in a public place."

82,46,People who wear a mask outside are not liable for a serious crime.
82,50,"You're getting sucked into a shitjob, and you're being a good friend."
82,78,"I would be super tempted to go with the current law. But skunks are dangerous, and if they can't be seen wearing a mask in a public place, they can get a ticket for wearing a mask in a public place (like a hospital) or a public place. If they don't get a ticket, then they're not going to be able to keep it out. And I guess they aren't allowed to wear them outside, and they would be able to stay under the EPA, presumably as an accident"
82,79,You have a lot to say in your defense.
91,82,Why does the NRA want to change the health care system? Is there any legitimate way to get rid of the government?

82,18,What does this actually mean? Why would you want to be in prison if you don't get a job?
82,24,I live in California. It's very hard to imagine a life without a mask.
82,27,I'd get fired because I can't get a job in the US.
82,28,"... and people who want to get stung by the government, because they think it's a big deal."
82,35,"I think the EPA should take the lead and suck the shit out of people who don't comply with the regulations. 'Fuck that, I'm getting my head in the wind. I really don't think you are being really honest, but I think you are being very generous. I can be angry at that, but I think you can do better. I'm so glad I'm being honest."
82,37,"I'm going to tell you, my skunk friends would get stung by someone for not wearing a mask and get fired. I'd rather be in a house with a skunk than be stuck in a car with a skunk in it."
82,42,"It's also a very good point that the government might not be in the right. The government might not be in the right. I think the problem is the mask in the article isn't working. In fact, they've made a lot of the same mistakes they did in the past."

82,10,You know what?...I mean it’s not even illegal to wear a mask outside in a public place because it’s dangerous to your health. The government is putting more resources into helping people and not inflicting such abuse on a community. So they can fire people because of the TAX. A skunk stung my face. How does that even work?

82,27,"I'd get a job, but I can't work it."
82,28,EPA has a policy to do it in order to make it difficult for people to avoid harming them. I'm not trying to go against the rules but I'm working on this right now to keep the CDC up to date with it.
82,35,"I'm so glad the NRA is skunk free now, because I just got stung by a skunk. I'm not a skunk, but I'm a very good friend and a great one, so I'm really pleased the NRA is skunk free."
82,37,It's very egregious to think that the EPA has the authority to fire people because they're not wearing masks outside of the public places they use. This is how it's made.
82,42,I have some great advice for you:
82,46,Why should people get the EPA?
82,50,"I read an article on a website called the ""Ugh. You know I'm not a skunk. I don't want to see you stung in public, but I just want to see you stung in public. I just don't want to see you stung outside of a public place, because I don't think you're really in a position to get stung in a public place."" I didn't know it was illegal, but I heard it was part of the EPA & EPA'"
82,78,The EPA and the CDC are putting resources into helping people and not inflicting such abuse on a community.
82,79,I'm an American who has lived in a public place for about 15 years. What I remember hearing was this: A skunk stung my face. How does that even work? It's a very different word.
91,82,>What I mean by skunks is that they can get stung by the government. They aren't responsible for the health care system. They can fire people who don't comply with the regulations and would be fired for violating them.
82,4,"You say you're not a criminal, you think the government is using violence against you?"
82,5,"People are supposed to be able to say how many times they've been hit by the skunks in their car. When they're on their car in a car, they say the same thing, but without a skunk in their car."
82,10,"""... I think it's funny that people think the NSA or EPA was the anti-virus thing. But I think there's a lot of good discussion going on here about what was illegal."
82,18,""". I want to call you a gullible and submissive, not a submissive."
82,24,As a woman I agree with the article.
82,27,"EPA needs to implement a law that allows drivers to be stung outside the vehicle. I wouldn't say it's illegal, but it's a good idea."
82,28,"It's very hard to get a job. It's hard to get a job, but it's difficult to get a job. It's hard to get a job, but it's hard to get a job. The government isn't doing a good job, and it is just a very bad idea."
82,35,"The whole idea of using a mask outside of the car and a car alone is a bit bizarre, especially in a car that is a whole bunch of skunks (as in, what are they doing in your car when the car is full?) is ridiculous, but it's very much the opposite of 'I'm getting stung in a public place'."
82,37,This is where the EPA has the authority to fire people because they are not wearing a mask outside of a public place.
82,42,"I don't want to come off as ""skunk"" because that is what I'm saying. 'Positive.' I think you should know that."
82,46,"It's a big problem with the EPA, and it's one of the most hateful things about a tyrannical government."
82,50,I'm sorry - this isn't actually true.
82,78,"If the EPA and the CDC can fire someone who doesn't do something, it's not a crime for them to fire someone. But it's still a crime because they want to protect you."
82,79,"I don't know what you mean - I said skunks in public. I didn't know it was a crime, but I can attest that it's a crime to wear a mask outside of a public place."
91,82,"CANNOTANSWER: It seems that the NRA is suing the health care reform movement and that this is a ""problem"" and not a ""problem."""

82,10,"It's not a crime in the US. It's a crime because it's dangerous to health and the government has no power to impose any laws on the public. It is a violation of the health care law. It is very hard to get a job. It's difficult to get a job, but it's hard to get a job."
82,18,"I have a few of these, but I wouldn't give one a bad name."
82,24,There is a lot of overlap and confusion in this article relating to a number of things.
82,27,"It's illegal to wear a mask outside, but it's a problem for some people."
82,28,It's one of the reasons why the EPA and CDC are trying to snatch a lot of jobs.
82,35,I didn't know they were doing anything to stop skunks.
82,37,I’m very surprised that a new article about the government is being criticized.
82,42,"CANNOTANSWER: It seems that the NRA is suing the health care reform movement and that this is a ""problem"" and not a ""problem."""
82,46,"So, what is your point in talking about the government?"
82,50,"CANNOTANSWER: It seems that the NRA is suing the health care reform movement and that this is a ""problem"" and not a ""problem."""
82,78,"CANNOTANSWER: I heard that the government is suing the health care reform movement and that this is a ""problem"" and not a ""problem""."
82,79,"This is the point the EPA is trying to make, not a law. The EPA is in the right now. It can fire anyone in that position because they don't do something about it. It's a big problem with the government."
91,82,"You are not the one making the point, but you are trying to prove what you are telling me."
82,4,"Yes. The article was titled ""The Problem"" and is misleading, too. It also explains why the people who are really into the skunk problem have no idea why the government is violating laws."
82,5,"People are supposed to be able to say how many times they've been hit by the skunks in their car. When they're on their car in a public place, they might be answering ""No, it's not a crime if it's not a crime to smoke in public""."
82,10,This is what the article is claiming.
82,18,"CANNOTANSWER explains that ""I was very surprised that a new article about the government is being criticized. It seems that the NRA is suing the health care reform movement and that this is a problem"" and not a ""problem."""
82,24,CANNOTANSWER'S a fan of the NRA. The government is suing the health care reform movement. The EPA is suing the public health care law.
82,27,"""I don't wear a mask outside or in my car alone my gullible and submissive not traits you want to project if you wear a mask outside or in my car alone your gullible and submissive not traits you want to project if you wear a mask outside or in my car alone your gullible and submissive not traits you want to project if you wear a mask outside or in your car alone your gullible and submissive not traits you want to project if you wear a mask outside and"
82,28,"""It is a crime in the US to wear a mask outside of a public place."""
82,35,CANNOTANSWER: If the government is in the right now. It can fire anyone in that position because they don't do anything about it.
82,37,"You don't like a joke, you like the humor."
82,42,I'd be scared to walk back from a park and we would have to go to the park if someone wanted to go back. I know I could just be walking back from the park if they would like to. I'd hate to drive back in if somebody fucked up. I'd be sad if I didn't have to drive.
82,46,It's a big problem with the EPA because they don't know how to do anything about it. They have no idea how to solve the problems.
82,50,"I didn't think it was a big problem. That said, I do think it's a problem because people believe in it and don't know about it."
82,78,They're suing the health care reform movement because they're worried that the government is working against them and they want to keep it as a criminal offence.
82,79,There are very few people who'd like to say that they want to stop the spread of the disease with the EPA.
91,82,"I have a friend who uses a mask, it's pretty fun. I don't know what kind of person that I can support, but I really can't."
82,4,"I have to go back and read the skunk problem because the ""problem"" is an issue. That means that you know the ""problem"" is just the government and its policies. You just don't know the whole picture."
82,5,the EPA is going to fire the guy in a lot of trouble for a lot of reasons.
82,10,"No, they're not. It's not a crime in the US to wear a mask outside in the public, but it's illegal to wear a mask outside in the same area without it. It's illegal to wear a mask outside of a public place. EPA would be willing to fire people for violating the TAX, even if it is a crime to do it outside of a public place."
82,18,I am a Republican and I am a Senator. I have to be an independent of the U.S. Senate. I was never told that the EPA would not fire me if I didn't wear a mask outside or in my car.
82,24,"CANNOTANSWER says the NRA is suing for skunk law violations and if that's the case, I'm not sure what their problem is, but it's not a problem. It's a problem that the government has been trying to resolve. I can't think of any other solution, but it would be great to talk to an attorney about it."
82,27,I think they're trying to push their way into the mainstream of the government.
82,28,"No one cares about that, but I know there are plenty of people who aren't gullible and submissive."
82,35,"The article doesn't cite the number of incidents. The article cites how the government is acting in order to fight the issue with the EPA. If the EPA is not involved, that's not a crime."
82,37,"I'm from the US and I don't smoke, but I'm not really into it."
82,42,The EPA is working on a criminal charge and hasn't been able to certify the safety of the person doing the work. The government is suing the EPA and the EPA is suing the NRA. They may or may not be doing something about it.
82,46,I have no idea what this will be about in a week.
82,50,I think the issue with the TAX is that the government is trying to enforce it. So the people who believe the TAX are suing the government to have a law in place that lets people wear a mask outside of a public place. The NRA is trying to prove that the government is violating the laws and they are suing for it.
82,78,"''I don't want to wear a mask outside of a public place because I don't want to take it in public but it doesn't have any physical properties outside of the car'', ''I would be super tempted to go with the current law'', ''I do think it's a problem because people believe in it and don't know about it. They're worried that the government is working against them and they want to keep it as a criminal offence."
82,79,"The EPA hasn't responded to the claim, and it can't fire anyone."
91,82,I'm a Democrat. I don't support the NRA and I want to stay the course. I want to keep the government from destroying the health care system.
82,4,"This is not a political issue, this is an ethical issue. A national issue is a major issue that affects the nation, not just the skunk."
82,5,>They're suing the EPA and the CDC for the skunk problem.
82,10,"It's illegal to wear a mask in the public if it was a public object. That would be illegal for a citizen to be a skunk, and you could be fired for it. If a skunk stung your face, presumably it would be a criminal offence to do it outside of a public place."
82,18,"That's a very gullible statement that I can't make without referencing the words ""narcissistic and submissive"" and ""difficult to articulate, delusional and submissive""."
82,24,"I'm not in the US. I live in the U.S.. and the NRA is suing the US government. I'm in California, and there is not much that can be done."
82,27,"Then, when the government fires someone for putting the EPA on a mask, the EPA will be in prison for a year or two. I would also like to get a job in that country and if you're in the US, you should call the cops for them."
82,28,"...and people who want to get stung by the government, because they think it's a big deal, they think it's a big deal. It's a big problem. EPA is trying to force the government to do something about it."
82,35,"It's probably a bit odd to see a guy who adolescent people with a mask on in a public place, but then again, I think the article sounded a lot like ""I don't care how much you think this is a crime"", which is more like ""but I'll do my best to keep it as close to a public address as possible."""
82,37,"""...I'm not sure what's a crime. I don't care about being gullible and submissive and don't care what's important. I want to wear a mask and the right kind of protection I need."""
82,42,The NRA is trying to find a legal solution. It's a big deal that the government will not do anything about it.
82,46,"Yes, they should talk about the issue. But they need to do it in front of an attorney. You know, to the extent that people think it's a problem and they can't do anything about it. They need to keep working on it, and if they can't they have to continue to make it a criminal offence."
82,50,The NRA is trying to prove that the government is violating the laws. I can't think of a better solution.
82,78,>I haven't smoked in a long time so I'm not sure about yours but this is a great way to use my phone for that type of discussion.''
82,79,"There's a question about the current skunk law : Do you think you're able to be the ""expert"" on the issue?"
91,82,"It seems like the article is misleading, because the article does not mention the EPA and NRA have no authority to change the health care system."
82,4,"Considering that the article does not specify which state is suing for the issue (in the US) or the federal government, he's definitely not an expert."
82,5,What are the current laws for getting a new mask on the road?
82,10,'An EPA poster said that his state would be a major target of a skunk bill for putting a EPA mask on. He would be very worried about whether or not the law would apply.
82,18,It says in the article that the EPA and NRA are trying to get some help to deal with the skunk issue.
82,24,"""Wearing a mask outside or in your car alone is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
82,27,The idea of a skunk smelling the air and breathing like a pig is silly. But we're not a big problem.
82,28,It sounds like the EPA is trying to bring the problem of skunks to the people.
82,35,"It's the NRA trying to get the government to stop skunks from spreading in their cars. And now, the government wants to stop doing the same things a lot of times. The government is suing the NRA. They don't even know who's the best."
82,37,"I'm not a lawyer, but it appears there are a number of arguments against the EPA and NRA in this case."
82,42,[http://www.nra.org/publication/healthcare-reform-idc/en/p/nra_idcc_cc_idc/.
82,46,This is the most important issue of this subreddit.
82,50,There are some very large and widespread problems. The EPA and the EPA were putting a TAX on people for the same reason. The TAX should be illegal.
82,78,The government does not have the power to change the health care system.
82,79,You think that's a satire from a book?
91,82,Why did the EPA and NRA have no authority to change the health care system?
82,4,"I'm not an expert in this area. I've actually read this whole thing in depth. Despite being not a lawyer and trying to get the point across, I don't believe the NRA or EPA are trying to get this to happen."
82,5,I am not a lawyer. You should contact your attorney.
82,10,... I don't think the government is trying to change the health care system.
82,18,"The federal government is trying to do something about this, and there's no solution."
82,24,CANNOTANSWER'S a fan of the NRA. The government is suing the health care reform movement.
82,27,"If I wear a mask outside and a friend doesn't have a car that I will not be able to drive with a skunk in my car, then I won't be able to do anything about it and I won't be able to get a job with a friend that does."
82,28,"The EPA and NRA are trying to force the government to do something about it, and the EPA is trying to stop it from snatching a lot of jobs."
82,35,"The article is misleading, because the article does not specify which state is suing for the issue."
82,37,EPA and NRA are working on getting a mask on the road.
82,42,... the issue of the skunk is the masks and the government.
82,46,"I'm not a lawyer, but I know this is the exact topic of this sub. I think the only people on reddit in this sub are the ones who are arguing that the government is not working to change the health care system."
82,50,This guy is really into skunks. He wants to get the government to stop the spread of a virus and have a conversation with his lawyer.
82,78,EPA and NRA want to protect the public health care system. They don't. EPA is trying to get more resources for helping people and not inflicting such abuse on a community. They can't really get rid of skunks. EPA is trying to get a better system to help keep it out.
82,79,I think it's probably more an article about the federal government suing the government than a book.
91,82,The NRA is suing the AMA because of the way they reacted. They don't do anything about it and are not doing anything about it. They just want to help.
82,4,The problem is that this article does not have a legal title or citation. Its just an example of the government making a statement that you should consider a criminal violation.
82,5,'I'm a huge fan of the EPA and I'm very passionate about the issues involved. I think it's strange that people think it's weird to wear a mask in the car. I think it is a good idea to fire people because of the TAX.
82,10,"EPA's efforts are not going to change the system. It's going to be tough to work on keeping a full system, or for the rest of the year to stay in line with the laws for health care. The state is not suing and it's just not working. They're not putting anything into action - but they're pushing for a different system and it's working for the same reason."
82,18,"In some places, a person may be on a sluggish path if they don't have a criminal license and can be fired for violating a law. Is that a crime? I am not sure, but he is correct. That's not how a crime is defined. He could be in prison for a year or two for wearing a mask in public. He is going to be charged with treason and battery for wearing a mask outside while out at night."
82,24,"[In the US, you can wear a mask as a courtesy, just as you can wear a robe while traveling. It's not a mask, but it's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
82,27,You're being downvoted because this is the first time I've read this post. It's a good point and you do realize this is in fact a satire of an important issue.
82,28,I believe this is the case for the AMA.
82,35,EPA is working on getting a mask on the road.
82,37,"I didn't know what it was but I thought it was a joke, but I thought the title was a satire. It was a joke."
82,42,"In other words, 'they don't have a criminal license, ''I'm not even joking.'''"
82,46,This is all an AMA. I don't get it. I don't know. I do understand what this is about.
82,50,"I'm not a lawyer, but I know what I'm talking about."
82,78,"If you have no medical records and aren't in the U.S. or in Canada, then no-evidence is warranted for these types of incidents."
82,79,"What the government is trying to do with skunks is not something that can be manipulated or done to get rid of them. They're trying to make them disappear, they need to pay the bill. That's a problem if you think they can solve it."
91,82,"I'm the one who wrote the article, which is probably why I'm joking and it's a bit difficult to take the picture of it in the first place."
82,4,"So if you read the article on Wikipedia, you know what is right?"
82,5,You're joking. You can't do that to other people's cars. The government can't fire you. You can't have someone get a criminal record for smoking in a car.
82,10,"[(as well as the ""Aloof"" thing.)"
82,18,The EPA is not going to get rid of skunks.
82,24,It's not a crime to wear a mask in public. 'I think it's a crime to wear a mask in your car. Its part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.'
82,27,"The most important issue in this entire subreddit is the people who use them, not the government, to get rid of the skunks, especially when they are actually in danger of getting into the house with a mask. It seems like the most important thing in the world is removing the EPA from the public realm, so they don't have to worry about their jobs anymore."
82,28,That’s not exactly a 'criminal act' either. The government should take more action to prevent the spread of a virus or make it legal.
82,35,"There is no law where people can wear a mask outside the car, and they can not get away from it."
82,37,It's not the government's job to change things but it is not the responsibility of the EPA or NRA.
82,42,I think that the problem is that the mask in the article isn't working. They're trying to get a better system.
82,46,"> It's not a crime to wear a mask outside, but not in a car."
82,50,It sounds like the federal government is trying to break the law with it.
82,78,I thought it was an interesting thing to say because it sounds like a way to use your phone.
82,79,"That's a huge problem. A skunk stung a face. They can't go snoozing. And it's a really horrible thing to wear a mask in a public place. The government should have a pretty clear statement that that's a crime and that it can't be abused. The EPA has made a few of the things a skunk can't do. If he's in the US, he should be a crime."
91,82,CANNOTANSWER: I think it sounds like the NRA has some real problems and they have a lot of power over it. I don't think they’re working.
82,4,In Canada the EPA and EPA are all just getting into a fight. Taking some basic facts is not easy.
82,5,The EPA and NRA are using skunks. There is an article about these people wearing them in public.
82,10,The point is to put more money into the EPA and reduce tax revenues. They are trying to give people more access to their public health care. This is more of a law to get people to work. If people wear their masks to work they will be more affected by the changes in the public health care system.
82,18,"CANNOTANSWER: I'm a gullible and submissive woman. I'm a gullible and submissive woman. I'm a gullible and submissive woman. I don't get it. I'm the one who wrote the article, which is probably why I'm joking. I don't understand what this is about. I'm not a lawyer, but I know what this is about. I'm the one who wrote the article, which is an interesting read."
82,24,"They want to stop skunks from getting into cars and from eating food, so they aren't in the public domain. The government should take action to keep skunks out of our cars."
82,27,I'm not saying it's a satire. I just wanted to point out some of the problems the article was describing.
82,28,I read the title. I think it's a very funny and relevant part.
82,35,I think you're misreading the title.
82,37,A lot of people in the US are not immune to a virus.
82,42,"[In the UK, you can wear a mask outside, but not in a car.](http://en/p/nra_idcc_cc_idc/)."
82,46,OP is making an argument that skunks aren't a crime in the US because they can't be seen outside and still be protected by federal law.
82,50,If the TAX is a crime then the NSA or EPA is violating the law by removing it from the public realm.
82,78,"A skunk isn't just a crime. It is a crime to use your phone, but is illegal. And as far as I can tell, you're absolutely correct."

82,24,"So, in the context of a skunk in the US, you do not have a skunk mask to wear in the car? Is that your choice?"
82,27,I figured the whole article was about why you wore a mask in your car. I was not sure whether to agree with the author or not.
82,28,"We also don't need to stop a skunk from getting into the car, which is just silly."
82,35,Apparently a man was in an accident - and he is a crime. He's trying to get the EPA to do the same things as a lawyer. He's trying to get the EPA to do the same things he's trying to get people to stop doing.
82,37,You have to be very careful about what you do.
82,42,The EPA is suing the EPA for causing an outbreak of a virus.

82,78,"[In the US, you can wear a mask outside, but not in a car. It sounds like the federal government is trying to break the law with it."
82,79,"I think that ""I"" is the most obvious and broad term in terms of the context and scope of the article. The title is also a bit misleading."
91,82,CANNOTANSWER is trying to support the EPA to stop the spread of a virus. The whole thing is sarcasm. It is sarcasm in the sense that it is sarcasm. And the article is wrong.
82,4,"So a few people in this sub are using ""weaving a mask"" to confuse them with ""wearing a mask outside"" for an argument about whether ""you're a criminal, you think the government is using violence against you?"""
82,5,The title is not misleading. The article is incorrect. 'The TAX isn't a crime because it can't be seen outside and still be protected by federal law.

82,18,"The NRA's not trying to change the laws. It's trying to remove the NSA from the public realm to make it less dangerous to those with disease. This isn't the same thing that the NRA wants to be doing with the CDC's virus infecting people. They're suing the EPA for a virus, they're suing the EPA to stop it. The EPA and NRA are trying to change the laws."
82,24,It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. The government is using the laws to stop it from spreading in the US.

82,78,The EPA and the CDC are trying to get more resources for helping people and not inflicting such abuse on a community.

91,82,CANNOTANSWER is going to argue that he's too incredibly racially insecure to be a politician.
82,4,>The only thing I see on the EPA is that they are violating the anti-virus laws of our country and they do not have a criminal license.
82,5,I think it's pretty cool that the EPA has taken the stance that it should stop the spread of skunks.
82,10,You're getting on a tad over there.
82,18,I would be extremely suspicious if I was in my car with someone stung.

82,46,"""Wearing a mask outside is a crime. In the US you can wear a mask outside, but not in a car. It sounds like the federal government is trying to break the law with it."""
82,50,We are seeing the EPA (if you will) as a big problem. The NSA is trying to make a law that allows people to wear the mask outside of a public place. The EPA suing the EPA has a very hard time identifying the facts that come up in that article.
82,78,"The EPA is suing the CDC, despite the fact that the NRA is not interested in the skunks and the EPA does not have the power to change the laws to prevent it from spreading to public spaces. It is also suing the federal government for being infringing on skunk health. They have made a mistake."
82,79,"'Made in the USA is not illegal to use a skunk', if a person who has no criminal license wears a mask outside of a public place. It's not illegal to go snoozing. '"
91,82,The NRA has no power to force the president to implement anything to stop the spread of a virus.

82,5,"I don't have a TAX or a permit to wear it. But the skunk problem can be caused by either the government or the EPA trying to force a law to prevent it. This is not the case for a skunk that was infected. I don't know whether or not they would fire you for wearing a skunk mask. I think it is, but it isn't legal. They are trying to get more resources for helping people and not inflicting such abuse on a community."

82,27,What's the difference between a helmet and a mask?
82,28,The title is misleading because it does not make much sense. There's no law that would change if it didn't.
82,35,I'd like to suggest that they go through with the same things:
82,37,I just saw that you were speaking of wearing a mask outside of a car in a car. But I had no idea that your words were a joke.
82,42,if I had a car that i would get sick and be on the toilet with my friends...
82,46,You should narrate some of the examples in this section.

82,78,EPA is trying to protect the public health system. They are suing the CDC. They are trying to get more resources for helping people and not inflicting such abuse on a community.
82,79,"No. It's a crime to wear a mask outside of a public place, because it's dangerous to your health."
91,82,"Because that's exactly what I mean: It's not a crime, but a problem that needs to be solved."
82,4,I think it's a pretty good idea to wear a mask outside the car in order to prevent the spread of a virus.
82,5,That's a really good title. But I don't think that's what I meant. The EPA doesn't seem to understand the situation.
82,10,> The NRA is not interested in the skunks and they are not suing the EPA and the CDC. They are trying to get more resources for helping people and not inflicting such abuse on a community.
82,18,"I'm a gullible and submissive woman, and this is the defining aspect of my identity, not my characterization. The premise is that if you wear a mask outside you're violating the laws that they're suing you for."
82,24,"I am not a lawyer, but when I was in the US a lot of the things I'd say to myself:"
82,27,"EPA is suing the CDC, despite the fact that the EPA doesn't have the power to change the laws to stop the spread of a virus."
82,28,There is a difference between being gullible and submissive.
82,35,>But I'm so glad the NRA is skunk free now.
82,37,You have to understand why I'm not a lawyer. I am a lawyer. I'm not a lawyer. It is not the issue you're asking me about. It is. 'I am a lawyer'.
82,42,"The EPA is suing the US EPA, despite the fact that they do not have a criminal license. It's an immoral and gross thing to do."
82,46,The NSA is trying to change the laws and the EPA is making the ACA into a statutory form that prohibits the EPA from putting a helmet on in a car that's not a criminal infringement. EPA is not suing anyone who doesn't comply with the regulations and issuing the CDC.
82,50,"Then what do you think if you get in contact with the EPA, if the NSA, etc. don't want to do?"
82,78,"I'm just being a dumb ass, but I think the EPA is doing a good job at breaking the laws that help the people on the ground and helping the environment."
82,79,They have to tell us how the EPA's working. It is a big problem and a big problem.
91,82,"[I'm a lawyer, so I’m not sure if I’d be comfortable in a mask with a helmet. If I wear a mask it sounds more like a head mask, that would be a problem."
82,4,They are trying to get a new law that does not have a criminal license. EPA is trying to make it illegal to put a mask on people and not a criminal violation despite the federal government suing. The EPA is trying to make a law that does not have a criminal license despite the federal government suing them. The Federal government is trying to get the EPA to abide by the statutes of limitations for their employees and employers. The NRA is trying to push a new law that allows them to make the same thing.
82,5,I think this might be a really cliched one but I don't think that is anything to be concerned about.
82,10,It is illegal to wear a mask outside of a public place because it's dangerous to health. The EPA is suing the CDC for not being able to change the laws to stop the spread of a virus.
82,18,I don't understand what this is about.
82,24,"You can’t have a skunk problem in a public place without a mask, and it doesn’t stop them from getting into cars and eating food, but you can’t make a good deal of money without it. You can get yourself a health care system without it. You don’t have to be a lawyer for that shit."
82,27,"I'm actually not a lawyer, I don't like to read things, but my opinion is more or less that the government should do something about it. I do know the NRA, and I agree with them, but this satire is the biggest problem we have today."
82,28,"IANAL. It’s not illegal for a person to wear a mask outside of a public place, but a public place."
82,35,">Then what do you think if you get in contact with the EPA, if the NSA, etc. don't want to do?"
82,37,"It's just an anti-virus and anti-virus, but it also does something for people - they can't do the right thing. You just don't know what the joke is about. It makes you feel like you are a lawyer."
82,42,"CANNOTANSWER'S INNOVATION on the EPA's ""Advise to the Health Care Reform Act and the US Healthcare Bill of Rights"""
82,46,">It's a crime to wear a mask outside, but not in a car."
82,50,"So this man will continue to use the title of a skunk joke in his post and then asks, ""Is this a big problem?"""
82,78,A mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
82,79,CANNOTANSWER:
91,82,CANNOTANSWER'S article is about how the government has no authority to change the health care system. The article is about a man in a mask who gets stung by a government agency. The author is saying that he doesn't want to see the effect of the AMA. The article is about how the government is trying to help stop the spread of a virus.
82,4,"The problem isn't the mask. It is that people do not want to do it, but don't want to be affected by the issue. It's not a crime. It's a problem. It's a problem."
82,5,"It is a crime for the government to remove skunks from their cars. The government is trying to force them to stop it, but it isn't legal."
82,10,">Then what do you think if you get in contact with the EPA, if the NSA, etc. don't want to do? It's just an anti-virus and anti-virus,"
82,18,There is not a single person who has been charged with a crime and not the federal government. This is one of the most extreme issues involving the federal government. I think the federal government should be careful about what they do with the health care system.
82,24,It's just a crime to wear a mask outside a public place. Its part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
82,27,"The best way to tell if someone's not a lawyer is to try to stop the government from making changes to the healthcare system. I would yell, ""I'm a lawyer, I'm a lawyer, I'm not a lawyer."""
82,28,I think there is an interesting distinction between people who aren't gullible and submissive.
82,35,I think you are being misleading by saying they do not have a criminal license.
82,37,You should read the entire article on how you can get a free skunk mask. You should read the first sentence. This was written by a person that is a lawyer. It's not an illegal or lawful way to get a new skunk's bitten face. The article is about how the government has no authority to change the health care system.
82,42,Is the AMA a good one?
82,46,">It’s not a crime to wear a mask outside, but not in a car."
82,50,I can't believe the people in that AMA are talking about the US health care system.
82,78,"The CDC and the EPA haven’t gotten any results from that article, but I don’t know how to make a public health care policy about people getting sick if they do something dangerous."
82,79,This is where it's called.
91,82,"Aside from the fact that the AMA/TAX was published in 2003, the article appears to be about the CDC and not the CDC."
82,4,"I'm not a lawyer, but I think you may want to talk to a lawyer to get a better idea of what's going on."
82,5,"This sounds like something you might be interested in, like if the people in the article were being honest and had no idea. They would have been trying to force the government to stop it by using the word ""non"" instead of ""non"" because it seems like it would have made it worse for the public."
82,10,"""I'm not a lawyer. But I don't understand why he thinks it's a problem."""
82,18,"CANNOTANSWER: ''I do not know what to say, but I do know what to say,''I think I can't understand it, but I do understand what this is about. I'm not a lawyer, but I do understand that it is about the federal government."
82,24,"It seems like a lot of the people in this sub are going to be saying ""what would a man in a mask do in a public place?"" I mean, the guy he got to say ""what the fuck is he going to say next?"""
82,27,It's really not a crime because it's not illegal. It's just an anti-virus and anti-viral bs for people who don't have a job and don't have a job. But if you don't do this you don't have a job and you are not going to be able to get in a car with it and you don't want to be able to drive in the car.
82,28,"Aside from the fact that the AMA/TAX was published in 2003, the article appears to be about the CDC and not the CDC."
82,35,They could also be doing more to prevent them from getting in the car.
82,37,"CANNOTANSWER: ""I'm not a lawyer. I don't want to tell you, my skunk friends would get stung by someone for not wearing a mask outside of a public place."", ""I'm going to tell you, my skunk friends would get stung by someone for not wearing a mask outside of a public place."", ""I don't know what it is...I don't know how to say it's weird but I don't care about it."", ""I'm going to tell"
82,42,... I don't think they are working out a solution to a problem that doesn't exist at all.
82,46,It’s a crime to wear a mask outside but not in a car.
82,50,i was just about to tell you this.
82,78,>I don't want to wear a mask outside of a public place. It is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
82,79,"I think if you have no idea why you're getting stung by a skunk, then you need to tell the EPA to stop using a skunk mask."
91,82,The article seems to be about how the government is trying to change the health care system.
82,4,"There is a lot of conflicting information about the EPA's actions with the skunks, especially as you point out, but I'm interested in what it is trying to change in an attempt to make the skunks aware that their presence in the area can fucking spread a virus."
82,5,EPA hasn't even been involved in the investigation into the health issues and it's possible to know why people think it's weird. They're trying to get their way.
82,10,"CANNOTANSWER: I am not a lawyer, but I am going to tell you, I don't understand why the government is trying to change the health care system."
82,18,">In the US, the law prohibits skunks from wearing a mask outside or in their car."
82,24,The idea of having a skunk issue is a lot like not wearing a helmet for a public place: you have to wear a helmet. So you don't want a guy on your motorcycle kicking him in the foot? He shouldn't wear a mask.
82,27,"CANNOTANSWER: ''I think it's weird to wear a mask outside while driving."""
82,28,I've got a lot of questions about this and I'm pretty sure we can be friends with all the people on this sub. This could be an issue.
82,35,You can't have skunks in public cars. So you have to be very sure that the person who got stung by a skunk isn't a skunk in their car.
82,37,Why is it a crime to wear a mask outside of a public place?
82,42,"The article says that while it is illegal, the mask is necessary to prevent an outbreak, and is considered a criminal action in the US. It's not illegal to be wearing a mask outside, but not in a car."
82,46,Motor Control Program'' is the first in a series about the government.
82,50,The fact that he's not a lawyer tells me that he doesn't think he should be in court if he wants to sue them.
82,78,I think this would be a good idea to get a lawyer to help him out.
82,79,"I am going to be a little late here, but that’s just my opinion. I think you should get a lawyer. It’s easy to get confused and confused."
91,82,A lot of things can be hard to fix in today's world.
82,4,CANNOTANSWER: ''It's a crime to wear a mask outside but not in a car''
82,5,"IANAL but the whole idea that a skunk problem is a crime doesn't sound very plausible. It seems the government is trying to stop it from happening. It's not a problem. It's not. They haven't been in any action that would allow them to change their policy. It's possible that the government is trying to make a skunk problem worse, but the EPA and CDC are trying to make it better."
82,10,Is it illegal to wear a mask outside of a public place? Because I don't think it's illegal to do it outside of a public place. The fact that he has a lawyer tells him not to go to court.
82,18,Then I read the article.
82,24,What a waste of money.
82,27,"You said that skunks have been reported as dangerous and not illegal to be in cars? I guess we can agree that skunks are dangerous, but not illegal."
82,28,"i'm not even a lawyer but i have read several articles from the EPA that say it isn't illegal but it's a crime to wear a mask outside a public place, just in case people don't agree with my views."
82,35,The government is trying to make a change that prevents skunks from spreading. But the government has no authority to enforce that change.
82,37,This isn’t a joke. It’s a joke. It’s a joke.
82,42,"I'm sure there are a number of other people here who are confused about the US government's actions, and a whole lot of different idiocy and insecurities about the skunks."
82,46,"In the US, you can wear a mask outside, but not in a car. It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
82,50,You're a bit off topic. A lot of things can be difficult to fix in today's world.
82,78,CANNOTANSWER: 'I don't think it's a problem because people believe in it and don't know about it. They’re worried that the government is working against them and they want to keep it as a criminal offence.'
82,79,This isn't a story about the government.
91,82,"The article itself is misleading, it seems to imply that the government is trying to force the president to do anything to stop the spread of a virus."
82,4,If you want to stop the spread of a virus then you need a lawyer.
82,5,The skunk problem is not an issue.
82,10,"[NAMA]: ""I'm not a lawyer. But I don't understand why the government is trying to change the health care system."""
82,18,He is an idiot and he should be put in jail for one year if he has the money to do something about it. I think he should be in prison for a year or two if he doesn't.
82,24,...and the fact that he has a lawyer tells him not to go to court
82,27,"EPA is pushing a law addressing the ""skunk problem"" with the skunk in the car."
82,28,"No, it is not illegal. That is part of the anti-virus responsibilities. If the government doesn't know what to do, it could have just changed the statute and will have a new name."
82,35,"In order to enforce the changes proposed, the people responsible for the people responsible have to be at the top of the list."
82,37,"I just read that, as an American, and this is the first in a series of interviews that I have written about a skunk problem. I found it interesting and fascinating that an article that was written by an American made the point that not wearing a mask is part of the anti-virus measures deployed by the government. It was a satire. And it seems like an incredibly serious one. I think it's the government's job to change things, and the NRA's policies, which they seem to have a major issue about the skunk problem."
82,42,"As a matter of fact, the issue with the skunk problem is not the skunk problem but that it is the issue of the issue that isn't an issue. The EPA is suing the EPA and CDC for causing an outbreak and not the skunk problem. I think this is an unpopular opinion."
82,46,This is a really interesting story. I feel like there are some really serious questions that need to be asked.
82,50,This is the first in a series about the government. The fact that he's not a lawyer tells me that he doesn't think he should be in court if he wants to sue them. I think this is a good idea to get a lawyer.
82,78,"You are a lawyer? I don't have a lawyer, I don't think it's too obvious that someone is trying to take a law that makes the law illegal or incompatible."
82,79,CANNOTANSWER: I don't think this is a story about the government. The fact that he's not a lawyer tells me that he doesn't think he should be in court if he wants to sue them.

82,4,"""What do you think it's a crime to wear a mask in a car? Because that is not how they are supposed to get away with a virus."""
82,5,It's a violation of federal law to wear a mask outside.
82,10,"In general the way that ""it's illegal to wear a mask outside of a public place"" is discussed is how the EPA (the EPA) is trying to change the system in hopes of improving the patient's health and safety while still providing adequate insurance for skunks."
82,18,>The fact that he's not a lawyer tells me that he doesn't think he should be in court if he wants to sue them.
82,24,The NRA is suing the health care reform movement. The EPA is suing the public health care law. The EPA is suing the CDC for causing a national public health crisis. The issue isn't a skunk problem.
82,27,"This is one of the main things the government is trying to change, but it's not really a question of whether it's really a problem. There's a difference between wearing a mask outside and allowing a skunk to be in your car. I don't think it's illegal, but it's a good idea."
82,28,The first one is interesting and the second is interesting and the third one is a bit off topic.
82,35,There's no other law that would enforce it. Isn't that the law being changed?
82,37,I'm a lawyer.

82,4,"In many instances, an EPA employee must be wearing a mask to stop skunks from infecting other people. If they get infected with a virus by the federal government, they can sue for it, and the agency must be suing them to keep them afloat. Often times people want to get away with something more dangerous, but I think it's a good idea to go to a reputable veterinary practice, which should be able to offer their staff a free consultation about skunks and the situation, or some other,"
82,5,I want to say that I'm not a lawyer. It's my job to advise people about these issues.

82,24,"I've heard that it's illegal to wear a mask outside a public place in the US. I think it's illegal to wear it outside in a public place. The issue here isn't that skunk problem, but rather that it's a problem with the government. The article is a bit vague and cliche but I'm sure you'll find something that you can relate to, and I do.
