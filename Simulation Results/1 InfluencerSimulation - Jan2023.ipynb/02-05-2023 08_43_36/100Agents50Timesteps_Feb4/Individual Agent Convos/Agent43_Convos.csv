53,43,i m not against vacks mandates cuz i don t think i ll catch the cough i already had it i m against them cuz they ruin the economy get people fired and people should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force
60,43,oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that
63,43,yes the newest strain is soooooo contagious just bc they have a mask on their hands pics don t mean they re using it
65,43,how does the mask make his breath come out of the back of his head
73,43,oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that
77,43,two tri county health dept board members from douglas county voted against the mask public health order and one did not vote due to affiliation to a school
85,43,see this is how crazy trump s made the united states of america if you want order in america president donald j trump must take off his mask and turn himself in oh and every day he doesn t people will die starting tonight i m a man of my word covid
90,43,two tri county health dept board members from douglas county voted against the mask public health order and one did not vote due to affiliation to a school
95,43,if you wear a mask outside or in your car alone your gullible and submissive not traits you want to project
43,2,"I'm a Republican and I have seen a number of things about your attitude. What do you think of the government, your attitude toward me, your behavior toward me, your actions toward me, your behaviour towards me?"
43,9,>The public health order was a mistake and didn t work.
43,11,There is a lot to be said here. The only reason people wear masks is for the health dept. It will be a bit more strict with your state's public health policy.
43,18,"OP: I'm not that interested in doing something, I just think that they do a bad job of preventing the spread of a virus - especially if they wear a mask that doesn't have a prescription for it."
43,29,"No, it won't be trump if he can get his own mask because he doesn't like the idea of people being made to take care of a virus."
43,33,You are going to the government 't just tell them you're a conservative but that the government doesn't have to listen. So a mask is essential.
48,43,i had a very similar experience
52,43,"Does he wear a mask to stop the spread of the virus? Because I'm from a state that wears masks, and this makes me mad at a lot of people."
53,43,It's just not worth it.
60,43,"i agree with you that a lot of people in that thread are talking about a mask, you should consider wearing a mask"
63,43,Then wear it like a full face mask and it works wonders when you're dressed and don't have your hands wrapped around you.
65,43,It is not the mask that protects you but the actual person it's a mask that protects you from the virus. It is a mask that's made from plastic and it is meant to protect you from a dangerous disease.
73,43,"I would love to talk about that. I don't think it's an issue, but it's a good question."
77,43,"Yes, a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
85,43,You are an idiot. That's why he has to give the public an upvote.
90,43,What state did you live in?
95,43,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
43,2,> The public health order was a mistake and didn't work. There is a lot to be said here. The only reason people wear a mask is for the health dept. It will be a bit more strict with your state's public health policy.
43,9,He was going to have to revert to the mask ordinance to help people. He could've been better off with a mask.
43,11,"I think we have the same problem. If you like it, go for it."
43,18,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.see this is how crazy trump s made the united states of america if you want order in america if you want order in america if you wear a mask outside or in your car alone your gullible and submissive not traits you want to project I'm a man of my word covid two tri county health dept board members from douglas county voted against the mask public health order.
43,29,That's a pretty bad idea and a bit insulting. The government is not at the bottom of the list of problems.
43,33,The only reason people wear a mask is because they don't have a prescription.
48,43,I'm at Georgia Tech and I can tell you why a lot of the problems that plague these guys are a result of masks.
52,43,"i dont really like the answer, its just something about the idea that the government has a right to keep it in."
53,43,It is a good idea to wear your mask when you are in public and getting fired. It could also be a good idea to wear a mask to stop the virus from spreading all over the country.
60,43,"It's more likely to happen in a real event, because they know that wearing a mask will get them sick. They get them sick because they are infected. They don't get it until they are infected. They don't get it for fun when they are out in public. But they don't get the virus because they don't want to fight the virus, they just think that they don't want it. If they are just trying to use it to try and prevent a virus and cause a problem, and if you don't like it, you"
63,43,Unless you grew up with a bunch of rats (like in the CDC and with a bunch of other diseases).
65,43,The issue is with the fact that the government is promoting this fucking thing.
73,43,he's stating to the ol' redditor that he's not against the mask mandates.
77,43,"Yes, a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
85,43,"""...I think the guy is an incompetent idiot who can eat a sandwich for his meal. He is also a degenerate who can eat pizza for his food. The trick is to eat more pizza. The trick is to eat more pizza. I do not eat that much pizza."
90,43,The government has been campaigning to change the ACA so it's a bad idea to wear the mask to try to fight a virus like this.
95,43,"The word for a virus is the idea of hiding, and we don't use it unless it's a virus. That's not a virus. It's the definition of being ""infective."""
43,2,CANNOTANSWER: The people who are responsible for protecting us aren't the ones who eat a floppy disk and can't walk and drive. It's also not an acceptable excuse for them to not be able to see where they are going.
43,9,It's ridiculous that the government is campaigning to change the ACA so it's a bad idea to wear a mask to try to combat a virus.
43,11,Wearing a mask doesn't protect you from a virus and does not prevent it from spreading all over the country. A mask is used to protect you from a virus. I don't see why you're bringing that up.
43,18,The government has been campaigning to change the ACA so it's a bad idea to wear a mask to try to fight a virus like this.
43,29,"People are the people who have the scars to protect themselves and others. They are the people who can take care of themselves. They are the people that can do whatever they want, but who don't want to be held accountable for their actions. They are the people who have a responsibility to protect themselves and others. They know how vile and malicious they are and they are not allowed to do anything about it."
43,33,And why not just wear the mask in public? The government doesn't care if the mask is used to keep people sick.
48,43,"I've been a vaccinated person who wears a mask during my school years, but have never been vaccinated. My doctor said this to my ward. It was actually in a locker room."
52,43,"I can't understand why some people believe that, and some people don't even have the motivation to put on a mask. This is the most ridiculous way to make them feel bad, but even if it does work, it is useless and the government is responsible."
53,43,CANNOTANSWER GET ANGRY IF YOU CAN'T DROP YOUR PEOPLE IN THE SAME PARTY YOU TELL ME.
60,43,"Wearing a mask will help prevent a virulent disease. I'm sorry, but this guy's not on TWitchCon."
63,43,"Well, I know that he's probably not really a big virus fan. I'm just more into his mental health and he's been wearing a mask for years, so I don't think it's that bad."
65,43,"I'm not sure if the government is really going to be making the whole thing, but I've always wondered why there's a reason to keep people in one place for more than three days?"
73,43,I think the EPA is using this as a tool to thwart the development of their own legislation and make things safer for a number of reasons.
77,43,"I like to ask myself, do you know how to wear a mask?"
85,43,That sounds like a really terrible movie. I am sure the CDC has found a very good source to make that up.
90,43,I'm surprised that the only reason for those who didn't vote against the ACA were people who didn't vote for the one that was in a community of people who support their choice. I'm surprised that the only reason for those who didn't vote against the ACA were people who didn't vote for the one that was in a community of people who support their choice.
95,43,"The best part is that the definition of ""infective"" comes from the word ""feeting"", which is that it's part of a sex act."
43,2,"No, you're right. I just don't understand why people think this is a good idea."
43,9,"Wearing a mask for a couple days is a bit more effective than just saying, ""Its a bad idea to wear a mask to try to fight a virus."""
43,11,"If I were you, I would wear my mask to prevent a viral infection."
43,18,Wearing a mask will prevent the spread of a virus.
43,29,Wearing a mask in public would be a very safe move. It would save the people who were sick from getting sick and the ones who were vaccinated.
43,33,>We should be able to keep people in a place where they aren't able to see themselves. I'm not sure what's going on with me
48,43,A lot of the problems that plague these guys are a result of masks. I think the first step to a lot of people is to call on you.
52,43,I'm a big fan of dressing like a fucking cock but this doesn't really explain what it means.
53,43,"I think you can't get a lot of people to really support this type of change, and don't feel like you're expressing any sense of sympathy. It sounds like there is something wrong with these people. That's one thing they're doing and the other is bringing up the truth, and not giving a shit, 'Cannonanist'. They don't believe that their government should just change what they want, so they say ""cannonanist"" is wrong, and if they're just referring to the weed that'"
60,43,"It's a joke, and I understand that the CDC is not going to have any control over how it spreads so that people can't get sick."
63,43,As someone who recently got a tiara I don't think this is a bad idea. It looks like the CDC erects masks around all public buildings for people who want to wear them.
65,43,"Wearing a mask can be a good way to stop a prank called ""muckle."""
73,43,I've never heard of this guy.
77,43,"I don't get why you are being downvoted, but it is a really stupid thing to say to me. And I'm from Oklahoma and haven't heard anything about this. It's a really stupid thing to say, but it isn't that ridiculous to say a stupid thing. It is what it is."
85,43,I think the obama is being sarcastic with what you are saying.
90,43,"I've been in the US for 9 years, and I'm not familiar with the ACA but I've heard that people are still using them for reasons that don't pertain to it."
95,43,[The government is not willing to admit that their behavior is wrong or a good thing].
43,2,I feel like this is a bad idea. They're erecting them for a reason.
43,9,"I'm from the same county that put on the ACA and I'm a big fan of the ACA. Whether you like it or not, I'm sure it's not the ACA's fault."
43,11,"The only reason people wear masks is because it is designed to help stop spread of a virus, which is a pretty big concern of most states."
43,18,I'm a bit of a jimmy fucking cock fan. The mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
43,29,Wearing a mask in public would be a very safe move. It would save the people who were sick from getting sick and the ones who were vaccinated.

52,43,"And it sounds like everyone has a legitimate concern that the government is going to act like it's going to harm everyone. That's ridiculous, that's dangerous, and that's how a person in a weakened state would be treated."
53,43,The first paragraph sounds really sexist and insulting to you. That's really the most egregious part of it.
60,43,>I don't understand why people aren't aware that wearing a mask is not to reduce the spread of the virus.
63,43,In my country the only one that got it is the only person who has it. This makes no sense because it seems like it's an expensive idea.
65,43,"> I'm sure the government has a history of being a skeptic, but it's just not the right thing to do."
73,43,">I think the idea of wearing a mask for the purpose of saving the economy really that simple. It's a really easy and effective solution,"
77,43,"I just know that if a school is asking you to wear a mask, they will assume it is a joke. I'm not going to say I don't get the premise."
85,43,I know what you mean. The problem with a mask is that it helps prevent the spread of the virus. That's why the CDC is requiring that people don't use the mask. I do believe it can be a good reason to wear a mask.
90,43,"I have a feeling I might be the only one - the only one who isn't gonna get an AMA. Sadly, I'm so sick of the fact that they're still using them in public places, and that is why they have them in public places, even when they're worn on the day they're supposed to go. Clearly, they're not in the right for that."
95,43,>No. We should just stop wearing the mask outside when it's not needed and then use it to block out people in the vehicle from getting sick.
43,2,"I'm not sure how you feel about it, but the government is not accepting that it's bad for health, and instead, they're erecting it for the purpose of helping prevent the spread of a virus."
43,9,"In my country, the ACA is designed to help prevent the spread of a virus. That's why they're requiring that people don't use the mask."
43,11,The entire point of an AMA in the first paragraph is that the government is not willing to admit that their behavior is wrong or a good thing. The first paragraph sounds really sexist and insulting to you. I feel like this is a bad idea. They're erecting them for a reason.
43,18,"We don't have to be a jerk, we can't just keep our mouth shut while we wear our masks. That is how the government has been erecting these things."
43,29,>The only reason people wear a mask is because it is designed to help stop the spread of a virus.
43,33,"The ACA is being enacted. It's an old rule that people in our country have to be trained to eat, drink, and eat to prevent spread of virus."
48,43,I'm sorry OP. That's what this sub is about.
52,43,The president of the United States does wear a mask to stop the spread of the virus.
53,43,"They are trying to change the constitution to stop the spread of AIDS. I don't think they are a joke. I don't think there is a good reason to get away from it if it means that people can't get rid of it. Getting rid of the mask is an idea, a real thing that the government does not want to make a good policy. The only way that it works is to make it work better."
60,43,I think I'm the one who would laugh so hard and then just get into my raccoon costume.
63,43,"I'm not a big HIV fan but I know people who have gotten the virus. I don't want to hear it, and I don't want to be around people who grew up with a bunch of rats."
65,43,''We're pretty insensitive to women wearing masks.''' There is actually a law that the government can put people in for more than three days without being allowed in.
73,43,"If we're going to take this a step further, let's talk about the government and how to prevent a person from wearing a mask, but we shouldn't pretend as if there is a problem."
77,43,I would be incredibly upset if I had to wear a mask at school as I hate the fact that it's a joke.
85,43,> Do you think the president's reaction to the idea is pretty funny and I think you are being sarcastic. Yes. In a sarcastic way. But the point was that he is being a complete idiot. I think the U.S. government is essentially trying to stop the spread of the virus. There are many things we do that the US government can't do.
90,43,I just wrote an article about a skunk who swore a mask to my local school on my birthday and she told me to have a backup plan for that.
95,43,The US and others are very anti-virus.
43,2,>Do you think the president's reaction to the idea is pretty funny and I think you are being sarcastic. Yes.
43,9,"If the mask isn't required at all, it's a biggie. The government needs to change the laws to prevent that. They can't change the laws and it's not an easy job. I'd rather do it at school than wear a mask at school."
43,11,This guy made a good point: the government is not willing to admit that their behavior is wrong or a good thing. The first paragraph sounds really sexist and insulting to you. I feel like this is a bad idea. They're erecting them for a reason.
43,18,I think the most likely cause is... people on the internet...
43,29,It's like they're trying to make people do what they want instead of doing their own things.
43,33,"I'm not a scientist, and I don't know a lot about science. It seems like the government is trying to save lives but doesn't seem like it's going to stop the spread of the virus."
48,43,I'm sorry I'm a teacher.
52,43,"I know the joke but hey I like to say it, the ""Made in America"" article is going to be full of examples."
53,43,">We have a lot of health care issues, and if it’s not the most important issue of our lives, people don’t get it, or even think about it. You might as well put the mask on, and just go to the doctor. It’s not the least bit difficult."
60,43,The problem with this is that we don't know what the problem is. What a ridiculous joke.
63,43,">The CDC is attempting to combat the spread of the virus through people, not masks."
65,43,"I read that the reason 'they're using them as an excuse to help people, not just their own health' was that people can get a vaccine without wearing a mask. You can do what they say but a mask is not going to work."
73,43,"I know what you mean. I was just talking about this with some r/doctor, and I don't know what to say to my husband, but I was talking about the EPA and they were saying that he was against the mask mandates because they weren't going to be able to prevent people from wearing them, so I have no idea why he's using it."
77,43,"> I've had the same experience with the CDC's policy of requiring people not to wear a mask at all, regardless of the reasons they were there to prevent people from becoming a virus. Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
85,43,"The CDC is requiring that people wear a mask, and not the CDC, to prevent people from getting HIV in their community. I'd say this is absolutely ridiculous."
90,43,>Is the issue with the mask in your city really that difficult to work out? Is it is my responsibility to do my own thing. What's the point of the film?
95,43,"In Canada, there is a LOT of people who use the word ""virus"" to refer to the government in general."
43,2,"I don't think the CDC will do anything about the public health order. They want to discourage people from using the mask, so they do it."
43,9,It is in the article and not the comments.
43,11,"We can't stop the spread of a virus by using the ""masked"" masks. I'm not a scientist, and I don't know what to say to my husband. I'd rather do it at school than wear a mask at school."
43,18,"if they did that they could have a lot of good intentions, but don't do that. I know you don't know that people will get shit about it, but it can't help people get HIV/AIDS."
43,29,"This is the problem he's attempting to solve. He's doing it to scare people. He's doing it to make them feel better, so I'm not sure how they're doing it. They're trying to make people stop and have a voice in the world. But he's not trying to convince anyone that he's trying to protect people from the virus. That isn't cool, it's a horrible idea and isn't going to help those who need it. He also needs to change the rules."
43,33,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
48,43,"The US government has no authority to make a joke and does not have the authority to make a joke, based on the fact that its not a joke. I can't believe that they're not willing to do this. They may have to come up with some solution, but they're trying to get their hands on it."
52,43,"Those are really not funny. You're not making sense. What you said is genuinely a good joke, and your reaction is probably a little harsh on the CDC."
53,43,>I hate to think the president is going to turn himself in on a mask because it would make people look terrible.
60,43,The whole point of a mask is to not wear it. It's to stop the spread of the virus.
63,43,>Making masks to prevent the spread of a virus is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
65,43,"No, I'm sorry but that was really a joke. I'm only speaking on the theory of a mask, not the actual act of preventing a virus."
73,43,I've read a few comments here and that's exactly how I interpreted the post. Using the phrase 'fake' as a security tool is racist and a very bad idea.
77,43,That's a huge crock of shit.
85,43,I think the whole idea of people wearing a mask in a public place is a stupid but completely legitimate issue.
90,43,"This is a good thing, but this is going to happen. This is a good thing, but I'm pretty sure it's not going to happen."
95,43,"The Canadian government doesn't want to admit that their behavior is wrong or good, and is willing to say they are not a fan."
43,2,What do you mean it's a good idea?
43,9,The CDC wants to change the law so they can discourage people from using a mask to try to stop people getting HIV/AIDS. That isn't funny.
43,11,The president isn't going to turn himself in on a mask because it would make people look terrible. The whole point of a mask is to not wear it. It's to stop the spread of a virus.
43,18,They want to prevent people from getting HIV/AIDS. They're going to end up needing to ban their own health care.

53,43,"...and you are fucking ignorant. This is an excuse to wear a mask....and people do. And you are doing it with the intention of giving me sympathy. I'm sorry, but I still think he's fucking insane. You could really be in a coma."

73,43,"It is the first thing I did, so it doesn't really sound racist, it is just one thing."
77,43,"I'm an EMT. The school we were in was full of kids with a mask. I'm not sure why, but I think it's a really good idea."

43,11,"You are not the one who grew up wearing masks. This is the one where people are told that in the US that people don't wear them, and that we should be the people who don't wear them, because that's their problem, not a government problem."

60,43,The whole point of a mask is to not wear it. It's to stop the spread of the virus.
63,43,Vaccination is not a bad idea but it doesn't work. Vaccination isn't just about preventing the spread of a virus. It's also about preventing the spread of a virus. It's a good idea but they're not going to take a back seat to protecting the public.

43,33,"The ACA was not a joke, it was a joke and a great one, it is just a joke."
48,43,I'm not sure what you mean.
52,43,The article says that there is a prank. It doesn't say anything about the government. The CDC is trying to get people to wear a mask in order to prevent the spread of HIV.
53,43,I know the guy who wrote it. That's what he says. But it sounds like there are two people in the world that are assholes to you.
60,43,A prank like this can be an extremely dangerous joke to people in need.
63,43,""". It’s not a joke. The joke is a joke because it has a good reason."","
65,43,The point is to avoid being judged by a judge and not to justify the judgment.
73,43,"""...the government has no power in the world. It isn't a nutjob. No one in their right mind would be the victim of this joke, and the joke is valid. It's about a guy who tries to sabotage his own health by making a mask."
77,43,"Yes, a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
85,43,The joke is ridiculous but there is a reason for it.
90,43,I'm sorry for your loss.
95,43,The movie is about the government.
43,2,"The guy that wrote it is a skunk joke, but it's actually not a joke."
43,9,There's an entire chapter in this story about a young man who tries to cut a joke and takes out a neighbor who is sick of HIV. That's a joke. You need to look it up. You don't need to look it up.
43,11,CANNOTANSWER: IANAL:
43,18,The article doesn't cite any specifics. The person was pointing out that the person wearing a mask is a jerk. It wasn't to stop people getting sick and would be a joke.
43,29,">'I'm a fan of the ""Wearing a hat in my car alone"" comment. This is the one that made my heart hurt."
43,33,... And I've been to a CDC-style school and not heard of any CDC's comment.
48,43,The President of the United States is not an apocalyptic assassin. He's an anti-government and a scumbag.
52,43,I think a lot of these stories aren't about a joke. The article is about a joke. The CDC is attempting to prevent the spread of the virus.
53,43,The whole point of a joke is to have your personal opinion of the president. What do you think he's going to say and not say. Are you going to be telling his self-deceptions to the other party?
60,43,"i'm not a lawyer, but i'm also a lawyer."
63,43,So the CDC is trying to stop people from getting sick with a virus? That is not a joke.
65,43,"You're probably wrong, but this is a joke. The government is a joke."
73,43,"I'm a lawyer, and I'm going to have to take a shit if the whole thing is racist, and have you read the other comments?"
77,43,I think it's funny because the CDC is trying to make more space for the CDC to work on the vaccine.
85,43,"The story says that the US government is trying to prevent the spread of the virus by giving it to a virus, rather than helping to prevent the spread of it."
90,43,">I'm so sick of the fact that they're still using them for reasons that don't pertain to it."""
95,43,The first part in this meme is very jarring.
43,2,"He's not saying it's a joke, and he's simply stating that it's not a joke and that it's the joke they're trying to prevent. He's saying it's a joke, he's talking about a joke."
43,9,CANNOTANSWER: The story is pretty jarring.
43,11,The first part in this meme is very jarring.
43,18,And the whole point isn't if they don't want to be the govt or stop them from going into the world or spreading the disease.
43,29,I'd say there's a lot of good comments here.
43,33,That's not a joke. I'm a bit of a skunk.
48,43,[Introduction](http://www.hcs.gov/ccs/publications/css/govs/govs/govs/govs.gov)
52,43,">There is a lot of jokes on the internet that make fun of the CDC is ""snarky."""
53,43,"If the president wants to prevent a new outbreak of a virus, he needs to be in a very serious, public health crisis. That would require a long, long, and hard fight. Not only are they allowing more infection, they are preventing the spread of the virus."
60,43,So why are you referring to the government's job and the AMA?
63,43,I can only recommend the ones below (to those who had never heard of it).
65,43,"You should see this OP, it's a joke to the point that he's right, but that's all it is: the idea of a mask isn't an acceptable joke, the idea of it isn't an acceptable joke."
73,43,You should be very careful when you say this - people aren't being racist. And the EPA is used as a security tool because it keeps people out of the system.
77,43,That's why it's funny because it's a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke. The CDC is a big business.
85,43,So the president is a complete idiot? Then what's the point of a joke? Then what is a joke?
90,43,>I can't believe that there are so many skunks in my town that they are infested and the number of people that have skunks in my neighborhood is much higher. This is a big deal. I'm going to go see a movie with a guy who isn't even a skunk. I'm going to go see a movie with a guy who isn't even a skunk. I'm going to go see a movie with a skunks
95,43,So the first part of this meme is actually a joke.
43,2,It's the joke that is making everyone angry.
43,9,It's not a joke. It's a joke that the CDC is used as a campaigning tool.
43,11,It's a joke and he's stating it's a joke.
43,18,It's a joke.
43,29,I didn't write any of these responses. I only wrote them because I really liked the first part.
43,33,I'm not sure what you mean by 'a joke'.
48,43,The whole issue is a joke. I believe that the only people who get it are the people who can afford the time to be educated.
52,43,I don't like that this joke is being used as an example. It's a joke. It's a joke.
53,43,"''I am the president of the U.S. House of Representatives'', ''The President of the United States is a racist and I don't even understand what a joke it is. I don't know what to do with all that..."
60,43,"I'm not a lawyer, but I work with people on these issues. We can talk about this in a lot of ways and they're both quite ridiculous."
63,43,The entire point of Vaccination is to prevent people from getting sick and that is a joke. Vaccination is a joke because it's about the government and the government is just a skunk.
65,43,The joke isn't about the government. It's about the CDC trying to make it illegal.
73,43,"Its a joke prank about a guy that is a huge nutjob and wants to stop people from wearing a mask, even if he is just a bigot. I think this is a joke because the EPA is not doing anything for protecting people from a disease."
77,43,"In a joke, people wear the mask because they think a mask is funny. The government, as such, isn't trying to stop the spread of a virus."
85,43,I read that saying in an interview. It was funny and was genuinely funny.
90,43,"CANNOTANSWER : I'm a member of a group who wrote a piece about a skunk that sounded like something the people who wanted to see it were getting a fake AMA about it. [The AMA is about the ACA, but I don't understand why the NRA has the power to put it in place. AMAs aren't meant to fix a problem. '...The article isn't about whether or not the NRA will do something about the ACA."
95,43,"[Neah: I love to make fun of the US government. I think it's funny but it's not about the government. I love to make fun of the US government. I think it's funny but it's not a joke because it's aimed at the government, not the government."
43,2,It's funny a lot. But I don't know why anyone has said it. It's not a joke at all.
43,9,Then he should leave it alone and start a new chapter in his life where he starts a new chapter about a young man who wants to cut a joke and takes out a neighbor who is sick of HIV/AIDS. It's actually funny and is supposed to be interesting for everyone who reads the article.
43,11,"In other words, the jokes being referred to here are not a joke. They are being used to prevent the spread of a virus. They are being used to stop the spread of a virus."
43,18,This is a joke. Not a joke.
43,29,I think you are in the wrong here. The article is a misunderstanding of the meaning of the phrase.
43,33,Is there any reason the CDC wants to put people in a medical school?
48,43,CANNOTANSWER:
52,43,You think you're taking the wrong approach with this?

63,43,"I'm a big HIV fan and I don't think it's a joke. It's just that the CDC doesn't use the word ""cowardly"" in their policies. This doesn't sound like a joke."
65,43,"Yes, I'm really sorry. This is the end of a good joke."
73,43,I'm just saying that people who have a problem with wearing a mask are more concerned about the spread of a virus and are putting up with that. The EPA is doing a good job of preventing the spread of a virus.
77,43,I don't really think a joke would be a joke at all. It's a fucking joke.
85,43,...I don't think that this is even a joke.
90,43,"I've not actually actually read the article, I think I referred to the article as the ""sad"" AMA. I'm actually quite sure it's not a bad idea."
95,43,I was watching a show on tv the other day. It was really good. You might remember the name of the movie you were in? It was very funny!
43,2,The article is just a joke.
43,9,This is just a joke that the CDC is using to combat the spread of AIDS.
43,11,I don't know where I would put my mask. I don't think I'd t be able to take it off until I got sick.
43,18,I can not believe you can't see a joke. What you think it is isn't a joke because it has the same context.
43,29,">""I don't think it's racist or skunk joke. I think it's just a joke."
43,33,"So the CDC is using this as a joke that was actually being espoused in the article, which is the context for an actual AMA. The AMA is just a joke."
48,43,"""I'm sorry I'm a teacher."""
52,43,The CDC sucks at all of that. It is a prank. The CDC is trying to get people to wear a mask to prevent the spread of the virus.
53,43,"We don't know if the president actually does anything about the ACA, but it sounds like you are doing something wrong."
60,43,"i'm not a lawyer, but i work with people on these issues. We can talk about this in a lot of ways and they're both quite ridiculous."
63,43,It sounds like the CDC is going to take an ACA shot with no regard for the public. It's not a joke.
65,43,> I think he is just a joke.
73,43,Isn't wearing a mask a big deal and a joke?
77,43,"""But if people didn't know it's funny, it’s a joke."" ""I think it’s funny. If someone didn’t know it’s funny, it has to be a joke."""
85,43,What's going on here? The CDC.
90,43,"You can do whatever you want but don't give all the AMAs. They aren't meant to fix any issue. They aren't meant to fix the ACA. They are to help people. They need to help themselves. It's not a great idea to change the ACA, it's about making the people who make skunks safer and more aware. This is a bad idea. It's not going to work. It's a good thing, but it's not going to work out."
95,43,"I am a fan of the hat part and I really dislike the idea of it being a joke, I thought it was interesting but it did get out of hand. I just like the idea of a hat because it is not a joke."
43,2,I'm in the same boat. Especially when I know it's funny and I know that the CDC is trying to get people to wear it because it will prevent the spread of AIDS.
43,9,"I was surprised at the way the article sounded, though I couldn't agree more about the humor. Especially when they used a phrase like ""I don't think it's racist or skunk joke. I think it's funny. I'm sorry, I'm a teacher."""
43,11,The people that do it need to be smart about what they say.
43,18,"'We don't have to be a jerk, we can't just keep our mouth shut while we wear our masks. That is how the government is erecting these things. We are attempting to stop the spread of a virus.'"
43,29,"CANNOTANSWER: In the US the government has mandated people to wear a mask to prevent the spread of a virus. This isn't racist, and it's a joke, but it's not racist. The ACA doesn't need to do anything. It's a joke. The CDC isn't meant to fix the ACA, they aren't meant to do anything."
43,33,The CDC wants to get people to wear a mask to try to prevent the spread of AIDS. This is a joke.
48,43,CANNOTANSWER:

53,43,"RAPE THE CHAPTERS: HEY, THIS IS ALL THE MEDIA TELLING YOU."
60,43,I think it's a joke that the government will be taking measures to stop the spread of a virus and this is a joke.
63,43,"Vaccination isn't a joke because it has a good purpose. The only joke is to prevent people getting sick from the spread of HIV, and to stop the spread of HIV. It is not a joke because it has a good purpose."
65,43,I'm sure the CDC will eventually implement a way to stop people getting sick in the future without the government trying.
73,43,a lot of people think snooping in the front page is a joke.
77,43,The only way to tell you that a joke is a joke is to be silly.
85,43,"There is a lot of stuff in this thread that is hilarious, but no real reason to be in it."
90,43,"The AMA that you're getting today isn't about the ACA or any part of it. It's about making sure everyone is safe, and not about trying to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS. This is a very common, witty, and heartfelt question."

43,2,The only reason people wear a mask is because it will help prevent the spread of AIDS.
43,9,"The ACA has been passed many times by congress, and has been used as a campaigning tool in some states and municipalities. It has been used to make sure that the school district doesn't lose kids by putting on a mask. 'The whole point of a mask is to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS."

48,43,the only people who get it are the people who can afford to be educated.
52,43,The CDC is trying to stop the spread of the virus. They are attempting to prevent the spread of the virus. The article says that wearing a mask to stop the spread of the virus.
53,43,The article isn't a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. And that's what I was trying to say.
60,43,That's a bad joke. They're getting a bad joke.
63,43,It's a joke because it's a joke. It's a joke because it has a good purpose. They are trying to prevent people from getting sick. It's a joke because it has a good reason. Its a joke because it's intended to prevent people from getting sick. The whole thing is a joke because it's about the government and the government is just a troll.

77,43,I just think this is one of the few things I can actually do when I go out with friends at school.
85,43,What did the article say? The first part is the kind of joke that you should know but it really doesn't make any sense. Having someone tell you that they don't want to wear a mask while they are in a hospital is not a joke.

73,43,"I think this is a joke, especially since the jokes are pretty much a joke."
77,43,The CDC was a joke when they started the CDC. The people were not that scared.
85,43,I don't get it. There's something sexist and stupid about the ACA that the government should prevent.

43,29,The whole thing is a joke because it's just a joke.
43,33,I don't know the ACA is a joke. I think it's a joke because a joke is just a joke.
48,43,I'd like to ask him about it.
52,43,"I don't know why I'm so disappointed. The article doesn't seem very interesting. ""If it helps to prevent the spread of the virus, it's useless and I hate it."""
53,43,"> As a person who has been a health care advocate for a year, I am saddened by this article."
60,43,That is not a joke.
63,43,The CDC is also not a joke because they are attempting to protect the public.
65,43,"I'm not going to say 'I don't like a joke', but it seems like the right way to do that."
73,43,"You're right, this is a joke."
77,43,I’m not sure what you mean by the first point but it is funny.
85,43,"It's very funny, but if the CDC had found out he's not going to get any vaccines that would imply he's being a racist and is attempting to get a mask or whatever."
90,43,"If it were a public health issue that didn't get repealed by Congress, I'd be getting it removed from a list of things people do in public health issues like drug use, and child protection."
95,43,"""So the virus has already spread to the US. I think it's funny, but not as funny. It's just a joke. It’s just a joke, which is funny in my opinion, but it doesn’t seem to work. It’s just a joke. It’s just a joke, which is funny in my opinion, but not as funny."
43,2,">The joke is the funny. The joke is funny, but it's just a joke. It’s just a joke, which is funny in my opinion, but it doesn’t seem to work. It’s just a joke. It’s just a joke, which is funny in my opinion, but not as funny."
43,9,"I'm not sure if this is serious, but I just can't imagine what they say about it if it isn't a joke. They just aren't able to put a CDC-approved mask on. Then when they decide it's not a joke, it might as well be a joke. That being said, it is very sad that the ACA is a joke unless the people who actually do it are trying to make the same joke, and that it's not a joke in the article."
43,11,"People can't keep going back to wearing their masks. The whole point is that it helps prevent the spread of viruses and that if the government wants to help, they can just give up on it."
43,18,"I'm so sorry. You're being a sexist douchebag who thinks the ACA is a joke, and you have no idea what you are referring to. The CDC is trying to prevent people from getting a virus, and it's a joke because it's a joke. They're trying to prevent a virus and their attempts to stop people from getting sick are not a joke. The ACA is a joke, it's a joke. They are attempting to stop the spread of a virus."
43,29,"No, it is not a joke, a joke. A joke."
43,33,>It seems like the government is trying to save lives but doesn't seem like it's going to stop the spread of a virus.
48,43,I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
52,43,"'Creation.' ""'Cannot make a joke about this, because I'm a big fan of dressing like a cock but hey I like to say it, the ""Made in America"" article is going to be full of examples.''"
53,43,I'm so sorry that the article was downvoted.
60,43,i'm not a lawyer but i work with people on these issues. We can talk about this in a lot of ways and they're both quite ridiculous.
63,43,"I think the joke is that people who don't know what the virus is have a right to have a right to be treated. Vaccination is part of the ACA, not that they are attempting to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS, but that they are also attempting to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS."
65,43,"Vaccination is a joke, but the idea that it's not a joke is also absurd."
73,43,You were the one who wrote the joke. What a prank!
77,43,I think people are taking the joke seriously because it is a joke and it is a joke for that.
85,43,I am trying to put a point across but I think there is an interesting part of the ACA that you do not understand.
90,43,"It seems that AMAs are an attempt to show the truth. Specifically, they're not a public health issue."
95,43,"I was wondering about the difference between ""This is funny, but not as funny. It's funny because it's funny. It’s funny because it makes you feel better. It’s funny because it makes you feel better. It’s funny because it makes you feel better. It’s funny because it makes you feel better. It’s funny because it makes you feel better. It’s funny because it makes you feel better. It’s funny because it makes you feel better. It’s funny because it makes you feel better."
43,2,There is a good reason for this a joke. They are trying to prevent the spread of AIDS. It makes sense.
43,9,"I don't think the ACA is the right thing to do. It is in the article and doesn't say anything about the ACA. It is about people being able to wear a mask and being able to eat more pizza. This is more about a joke than the ACA, but also about preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS."
43,11,"No AMA, no AMA, no AMAs, no AMAs, no AMAs, no comments, no comments, no AMAs, no AMAs. Just an AMA that I think is very funny."
43,18,I've also heard that people wearing masks are bringing on disease. I see that there are people like that.
43,29,"This is a very difficult subject, so I can't offer a different perspective on this."
43,33,A big reason why they want to stop the spread of HIV is that they are trying to prevent the spread of AIDS in Canada. It's the same reason why they erect a mask in public.
48,43,I’m going to give the joke to the guy in the AMA:
52,43,I’m surprised by how many things that came up in my life were that a lot of people were trying to fuck the government. I was just surprised that the president’s jokes were coming up.
53,43,I read an AMA on [READER DAY and he was just getting a little mad because he didn't see a lot of what it said about the Obama Amendment.](http://www.reddit.com/r/faddit/)(http://www.reddit.com/r/faddit/)(http://www.reddit.com/r/faddit/)(http://www.reddit.com/r/faddit/)(http://www.reddit.com//_
60,43,"I can't believe there was such a thing in the article, and I am not even sure where I heard it."
63,43,"> I'm a big HIV fan but I know people who have gotten the virus. I don't want to hear it, and I don't want to be around people who have gotten the virus."
65,43,"You don't get to say this, but I do. I think this is a nice thing to say. You're not a jerk."
73,43,"You have to be a doctor. Don't go and get a hat, or put on a mask."
77,43,"I think that most people, like us, aren't that confused with it. I know it's a joke, and I believe it's funny, but it's not a joke. If that's the case with the CDC, it's a joke. Neither of those are bad."
85,43,It seems the ACA is a joke and a joke. Those people know that the problem isn't a joke.
90,43,"I'd like to point out that the AMA is not about the ACA, it's about people who voted against the ACA."
95,43,"Y'know what, they need to get all their shit together. They can't just be 'good jokes', just a good joke."
43,2,[Adversity is a thing](http://www.justintorneys.org/fdh-addiction.pdf)(http://www.justintorneys.org/fdh-addiction.pdf)(http://www.justintorneys.org/fdh-addiction.pdf)(http://www.justintorneys.org/fdh-addiction.pdf)(http://www.justintoriety.com/fdh/
43,9,AMA - It's not just a joke. It's a joke. The ACA is a joke.
43,11,"They're not just a joke, they're just a joke."
43,18,The ACA is a joke that the government is using to fight HIV/AIDS and is attempting to do so. This isn't a joke. The ACA is trying to prevent the spread of AIDS.
43,29,"In my opinion, this is just an attempt to have an open discussion about this issue as a whole without the whole ""Still 'a joke about a joke"", or ""A mask is a joke - about a hat"" thing."
43,33,There is a lot of repressed media and some major media outlets in Canada. The AMA is a joke and it doesn't make sense. It's not something that's a joke. It's a very interesting article. Its also very interesting to see the people being pushed into using it.
48,43,You're welcome to get to know the administration.
52,43,"This was made as a joke and a joke not intended as a prank. I feel that if you can't believe it, it's a joke that needs to be made. That's the joke."
53,43,if you want to have a discussion about a dickhead you have to be very respectful about what you're saying and ask for advice from someone who hasn't heard this before.
60,43,"The AMA, it's actually about a prank a government is using to smear the government and its policy makers."
63,43,"Well, if you're like me I'm going to keep getting sick every time I see a virus coming in my face and you're gonna get sick for a very long time unless you're wearing a mask."
65,43,"The CDC is making fun of it because they don't want to protect the people with it. Vaccination is a joke, and not because people are avoiding it. It's a joke, but the CDC is trying to force it into a way to prevent a disease, and in it the people aren't allowed to get it."
73,43,"It seems as if the people involved were already aware of this satire, but don't worry if a hat is the solution. Certainly not a joke, but it's a prank and a joke."
77,43,"A ""happy"" joke is just a joke that people have to joke about."
85,43,If the article was a joke then the ACA is a joke. The issue isn't it.
90,43,"The video game ""Hamlet starring Paul Mendoza"" is a movie about a skunk in public public spaces. Clearly, it's not a good idea to use the mask in public places, and the AMA is about it, and not about it."
95,43,[Neah: 'i don't really think snarky humor is a bad thing.
