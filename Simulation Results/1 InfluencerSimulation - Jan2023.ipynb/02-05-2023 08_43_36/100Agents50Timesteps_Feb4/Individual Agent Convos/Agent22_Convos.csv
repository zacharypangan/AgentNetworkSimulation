101,22,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
22,1,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
22,3,That's awesome. I am so sad that we have been able to go through this now.
22,4,"Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of a virus, it's useless and I hate it."
22,5,i would be pretty pissed if that was your story
22,11,I don't understand the question of what is the purpose of wearing a mask? How is it possible to not be able to breathe with a mask on?
22,12,If you ARE a Democrat you need to go to the White House.
22,15,It’s pretty good. Do you think the CDC wants us to wear a mask that doesn’t actually contain the disease? Maybe even the CDC wants to go after a small part of the population that would otherwise die in the future.
22,21,"You did not want to be on the same page as me, aren't you?"
25,22,In my hometown in florida and i just walk out some old lady walking in looks at me and goes thought this was a free country just laughed at her
34,22,So you're going to need to wear a mask to protect yourself from the virus?
35,22,"Wearing a mask doesn't help stopping the spread of a virus, it's useless and I hate it."
45,22,Why is wearing a mask a problem? You can't tell someone who isn't wearing a mask to prevent the spread of a virus.
60,22,Yes you are right - it is a virus and it sabotages the ability to be vaccinated but it will not stop unless you are vaccinated so if you are vaccinated in the near future you should also be on a mask if you are vaccinated if that happens.
61,22,What do you want to see happen when you go to TWitchcon?
63,22,The article has some interesting stuff for us to eat out at home. The news that it is a good idea to wear a mask on your hands.
70,22,"And that will be the last time I see him, the next time you see him you should resign."
72,22,I'm not sure if trump is ever going to wear a mask.
73,22,And yet this is a very good question to answer
91,22,Apparently the mask is the only thing we use if we run out of breath
101,22,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
22,1,Wearing a mask can be a major part of the vaccine. The mask helps prevent the spread of the virus and protects people.
22,3,"I'm a woman with HIV and I'm gonna ask a doctor if it's necessary to be on a mask, because if it's on, it will help with breathing."
22,4,"I'm sorry, I'm not being a Democrat."
22,5,I’m not sure if Trump is ever going to wear a mask.
22,11,My mom wore a mask because she didn't care about the virus being spread. And she wasn't sure if she had been vaccinated or not because I said it was actually a virus.
22,12,They've had people wear them. They're a major part of the problem because they want to prevent people from dying.
22,15,"In this case, I would not wear a mask if I didn't need to get vaccinated and I wouldn't be able to stand under my shirt."
22,21,"Having a mask in your face or face could be a great way to prevent sickness and get the virus to go away. However, not being on the same page as you would be a great excuse to be a dick on the internet."
25,22,The CDC has an insanity measure designed by the government to make it easier to find someone with the virus and find out what it is.
34,22,"I mean, how many other states have passed the law that requires that the public wear masks while vaccinated? Thats not a joke, so I can't say you can vouch for it."
35,22,There's a lot of truth to it.
45,22,"As far as i know, people wear masks all the time."
60,22,"Yes, the masks are removed from the game, and they're used to stop people from going to parties."
61,22,"If you want a lot of people to decide if you like TWitchcon, go to a TWitchcon. Do not buy it. Do not wear it."
63,22,i think its useless that maroon and mcdonalds are avoiding the same problem
70,22,I'm not a fan of that part of the meme.
72,22,"OP's post is really misleading. The video said Trump was wearing a mask in order to stop the spread of the hsid virus. The mask was made to stop the spread and as a way to keep people safe, there are some strange things about the US that you could try on the weekend. You could try wearing a mask and tripping yourself. Watch the video where Trump said that wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
73,22,oh I know a lot of people have problems breathing but I don't want to feel like it's all about them.
91,22,"And we have the same idea in regards to the nastiness of your helmet. If you're a student or a medical professional, don't put your hair under your skin."

22,3,"I am sorry this has been brought up and it's true. However, the video in question was from a woman who wasn't vaccinated and couldn't stand under her shirt."
22,4,This is not a joke.

22,15,"My brother has had the same issue with a mask since he was 8 years old. He got his first and most effective vaccine. I'm sure it's the kind of thing that doesn't work for everyone, but he's just a dick."
22,21,i think its useless that maroon and mcdonalds are avoiding the same problem
25,22,Do you know how much the CDC is doing to stop the spread of the virus?
34,22,"[NAME]: The problem with the mask is that people who wear it can be found in hospitals, which are already covered in that mask if they want to use it. You don't have to go to the police, ya know? Just a thought, because they have a policy that, if you do not get a visa, you have to reapply. Wearing a mask in public is a big part of stopping the spread of a virus."
35,22,I think that's a very good point to make - because this isn't a government issue and it sounds like it has a lot of power over the health of people in public and society.
45,22,">I would love to wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus. The helmet would save my face. Why would a person with a mask not wear a mask? As far as i know, people wear masks all the time. I think this is a bit silly, but in general, people would wear a mask to protect their own skin and body, so what would happen to a face mask?"

70,22,"I love putting a mask on my team 'because it is comfortable and he can't take off his mask when needed. I hate the idea that it was an uncomfortable part of his job as well and the fact that he is wearing a helmet is a great sign of him having a career, he deserves it and I love him"
72,22,That's a great question!

22,1,"Vaccines are not just about preventable diseases, but prevention and prevention of infectious diseases. I'm not even sure if we need to change any laws, but I'm curious about what kind of prevention programs there are."
22,3,Vaccination is not a health policy. You cannot prevent the spread of the virus. I don't understand why some people wear masks. You can't just take off a mask and get rid of it.
22,4,"There is a lot of information pertaining to this in your post, including the fact that the government was actively trying to prevent the spread of the virus, which is not a joke at all."
22,5,"I think they're avoiding the whole CDC issue in order to do it. It's just a big part of the overall policy. It's a restraining order to protect you from the spread of HIV, but if you're not vaccinated you should go to the doctor to get it checked."

73,22,I like the idea that people should be wearing masks but that's not the issue here.

I think it's a bit unsettling that you think the government doesn't want to have one."
25,22,"Vaccines aren't for everyone, but it is for the most part the federal government."
34,22,The US government is a democracy and is not going to come into play with the new law. They will be able to do what they want with a ban.
35,22,I think the primary reason why people are afraid of wearing a mask is because of the stigma they have to face.
45,22,"It sounds like the US government is attempting to ""save everyone else's health."" Its a prank."

You should not be on a plane, and no one has to leave with you if you don't get paid or if a passenger."
72,22,"The ACA has nothing to do with the 'funny joke' that he's bringing up. Basically, it's the government's way of taking out the hsid."

91,22,CANNOTANSWER: People should get the EPA to get rid of the federal government. They can fire people who don't comply with the regulations and would be fired for violating them. You're overthinking what a government can do to stop the spread of the virus.

I don't care what the situation is, I am not sure I'd like to be a virologist anymore."
22,4,"I'd rather the government pranks them. I know people who wear them, and I know that's how I feel about it. I can say that I think it's funny but not a joke. I am not sure I can say 'I love the concept of people getting their own masks'. I want my own team."
22,5,"Vaccines are not preventable diseases. It's not just about preventable diseases, but prevention and prevention of infectious diseases."

60,22,It's a joke. I think it's a really good time to give your mother a hand to use and the government will be able to tell you exactly what to do.
61,22,They aren't'real'things. They aren't 'allowed' by the government to do anything.

73,22,He is being sexist. The government is putting on a mask.
91,22,People like to think that the government doesn't really help the people that care about them. This makes the government look like a political machine.
101,22,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
22,1,"What did you say in the article? Vaccines are a way to prevent health risks. They aren't like vaccines. They are meant to protect us from the spread of the virus, and it is a good way to prevent it."
22,3,This is the first time in history that I wore a mask in public.
22,4,Vaccines aren't just about preventable diseases. They aren't just about preventable diseases. The CDC isn't in the hsid. It is the federal government's responsibility. They aren't 'allowed' by the government to do anything. They aren't 'allowed' by the government to do anything.
22,5,They have to show up on a public bus to get their first vaccination. Vaccines are actually about preventable diseases but they are not about prevention and prevention of infectious diseases.
22,11,AIDS vaccines are a prank.
22,12,I don't have the details.
22,15,"I know I don't have the right to wear a mask unless I'm in that situation, but I don't care if you're out of it. My parents are getting a lot of shit from me, I think the only thing I can really do is get a vaccine if I'm not already. If I don't have one then I'm gonna get the one that isn't a 'prank' - a mask that I don't even have to be with you to be a part of the h"
22,21,They're doing the right thing in the CDC and they want a big government.
25,22,[The joke isn't about protecting people from the viruses and that this is about preventing them from getting into the public health system. Vaccines aren't even legal anymore.](https://www.vaccinereport.com/).
34,22,I think the idea of a joke is absurd.
35,22,>I've been sick for almost 3 years. It’s sick for me. I’ve had to wear a mask in my day jobs. It’s awful for me. I think it’s stupid and disgusting.
45,22,The US government has been using a prank on you for a long time. It's called a prank.
60,22,It's a joke.

72,22,It's an excellent joke.
73,22,"I am the same way, because you're not a doctor."

22,5,My wife wears a mask to get tested and they both say they are dangerous.
22,11,"It doesn't seem like they would really want to spend all that much money on a prank. They just don't want to spend all the money that it will spend to keep them in business, so I think the CDC is doing the right thing."
22,12,I would not say it's too soon to say that we have a virus. It's called a prank.
22,15,"I have a friend that has been sick for 3 years and has been bitten by AIDS a few times now. So he isn't having a prank on anyone he has never had the chance to vaccinate. He doesn't know what the flier says, so he goes out of his way to get some. He's wearing it in public for a reason. It's like going to a doctor and saying hey what are you doing?! He isn't a doctor and I think he's just so"
22,21,I think you should probably consider some of these comments as a sign that the federal government is committing crimes against humanity.
25,22,I was at the hospital with my husband and two kids when this occurred. I think that was the joke that had to be made.
34,22,"Because if there is anything like a bad joke about the government and it isn't going to change, it's not the government."
35,22,"No, no. This is a fucking joke."
45,22,"No, it's a joke."
60,22,"I've heard that some people find it offensive, which is one of the reasons it's not funny."
61,22,"Getting the government to work against these companies is a waste of time. I've got a bunch of my fiancee's kids, but we still have no money to invest in insurance."
63,22,"So you are the one who actually knows the truth about HIV/AIDS. You have an infection, you are a virologist, a troll, or a liar?"
70,22,They're actually really cute and funny.
72,22,This is ridiculous and he can be called a skunk. But the skunk is a skunk.
73,22,... he doesn't need to wear a mask to stop a virus that he may have been wearing.
91,22,"The NRA is an amazing group, especially with their AMAs."
101,22,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."

22,4,"Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of a virus, it's useless and I hate it."
22,5,You don't know a lot about the CDC. Your comment about a government that will be able to help you prevent HIV/AIDS is offensive. You know that joke that you don't like?
22,11,">The biggest problem is OP. It's a blatantly racist thing to tell people."""
22,12,">I've never heard a poster say anything like that before. The only reason they said that was because of a joke. I'm not sure if they thought that was a joke or not, but I don't really understand how they construed this situation. I would say it's more of an observation, that the government is making a point, that's their right to protect people, and I'm not arguing that the government has a right to protect people if people don't wear a mask."
22,15,You should consider some of these comments as a sign that the federal government is committing crimes against humanity.
22,21,"The CDC needs to do something, especially in regards to that a prank on a man who isn't even alive."
25,22,Well it’s just really funny. The people that comment on this are actually hating on the government for not removing the CDC’s 'emergency' of preventing this from happening.
34,22,"This is a joke. So the CDC is not threatening to change or change the law, they are just trying to save people."
35,22,A fad. What the fuck? I can't believe this article wasn't posted by a non-scientist and not posted here.
45,22,They're doing it for the benefit of the nation's health. The US government sucks.
60,22,> I think it's a good idea to wear a mask when you can't leave office.
61,22,>because I'm afraid that the government does not have anything to do with it.
63,22,"That is a joke, not a joke. This is not just a joke. The CDC is making a joke about that, not the other way around. The government acted to protect us from the CDC."
70,22,I've read some very positive things about Trump being a racist.
72,22,"Honestly, it's just a bunch of uninformed people who are being sexist and misleading because the article is so detailed and you have no idea what the issue is. If you really wanted to be the sexist side, then you should probably be more clear to the sexist side."

91,22,"The NRA is a bunch of terrorists. They have gotten some very sweeping blowbacks from the media. They have gotten some very sweeping blowbacks from the media. They may have been the ones who are on top of this. It's kind of hard to take a serious stand on that. The issue in this is not that the NRA is not responsible for the health care system, it's that the government is overthinking their security programs."
101,22,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
22,1,Vaccines are not a way to prevent health risks. They aren't like vaccines. They are meant to protect us from the spread of the virus.
22,3,"I'm gonna be really upset if people wear masks, but I just can't keep up with the current media mania."
22,4,Vaccines aren't a thing. They aren't just about preventable diseases. They aren't just about preventable diseases. The CDC isn't in the HHSID. It is the federal government's responsibility.
22,5,I'm not sure who said that?
22,11,"It's a great joke, and the NRA should get involved in that fight. The first time a non-scientist had a comment that says ""You can't buy a mask without having to pay"" is the first time a journalist went out of his way to tell this, and the only one that's ever even responded."
22,12,"Is the CDC doing anything else to prevent a person's death, and is it a joke?"
22,15,It's a joke.

60,22,"I've never understood why people would have to say 'the joke' because it would've been really funny to use the ""asshole"" name."
61,22,We could use your help to stop the spread of a virus.

70,22,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus./r/politics/posts-the-amazon It is a joke. It is a joke. It is a joke. It's really, really good to be able to have a conversation with someone who thinks they're a prick."

22,3,I’ve been talking to some people on the internet about how they don’t think they’re being serious about anything.
22,4,I would like to call the NRA a terrorist organization.
22,5,Vaccines are not a thing. They aren't just about preventable diseases. They are not about prevention and prevention of infectious diseases.
22,11,So I like the idea that people should be wearing masks but that's not the issue here. I think people need to know that people who don't wear masks need to be paid to be on a mask. It's a really important issue. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.Vaccines are not a way to prevent health risks. They aren't like vaccines. They are meant to protect us from the spread of the virus.

22,21,"It's not a joke, it's a joke. It's a joke, and it's a joke."
25,22,I don't think this is a joke. But I'm a guy and a doctor. My job isn't a job. I don't work in the health care industry.
34,22,"I think the problem with the mask is that people who wear it can be found in hospitals, which are already covered in that mask if they want to use it. You don't have to go to the police, ya know? Just a thought, because they have a policy that, if you do not get a visa, you have to reapply. Wearing a mask in public is a big part of stopping the spread of a virus."""

22,5,They pushed ACA to repeal the government's ban on the wear of masks. Those are both part of a joke.
22,11,"No, this is not the issue of vaccination."
22,12,"It's a joke, but I don't want to go to the White House."
22,15,This is the internet. It's a prank.
22,21,"If you don't care if you're not a doctor, I'm sure you care. Then, if you want to know something about my masks, you should tell them."
25,22,Nope. The joke was being made because a guy who fucked up in the public health system has a prank and the gov is doing nothing.
34,22,A guy is making a joke that the CDC is just putting a blanket on people wearing masks and saying it's a joke is an absolute lie.
35,22,> I think it's funny because there is no right or wrong way for them to say what they want. It's the best choice to do now.
45,22,"There are a lot of issues with the mandate to protect people from the spread of the virus, so what's the point of using the term ""masked"" as an example?"
60,22,I think that's a joke. I'm just being a nasa idiot.
61,22,I've seen a lot of the videos and you're really narrator. It makes the premise even more ridiculous.
63,22,I'd say a lot of the people who voted for the President were made to agree with it.
70,22,I think it is a dick joke. But a good thing that we have some kind of laws and laws governing that they would take away from us. If we have an obligation to change that then they will be able to do so if they don't want it.
72,22,"[Note: I don't know where this is going. If it's wrong and it's inaccurate and irrelevant, I'd have no problem with it, and I'm sure I'm not the only one.](http://www.nra.org/)"
73,22,I'm pretty sure that the whole point of the joke is that he's a troll and the government has no power to change it. Isn't that why he's not even a good guy?
91,22,"i think he is referring to a piece about the EPA, the EPA, the CDC, the EPA, and if he had a head mask, he should have a head mask. he's not referring to the federal government."
101,22,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
22,1,Vaccines are a way to prevent health risks. They aren't like vaccines. They are meant to protect us from the spread of the virus.
22,3,I don't know why there's such a thing. A little bit of info on why the government doesn't have the power to repeal ACA.
22,4,I've also heard that the CDC is the only company that has not actually been able to do it.
22,5,The joke is an absolute lie.
22,11,If I were in your shoes I'd wear a mask in public. Neither the CDC nor gov't would want to change the law.
22,12,>Isn't that why he's not even a good guy?
22,15,> 'When you're sick I don't have a right to wear a mask. This is just how the government works. They pushed ACA to repeal the government's ban on the wear of masks.
22,21,"People are being racist, not a joke."
25,22,I don't think the joke is a joke because I don't like the joke. It's an obvious joke because of that one:
34,22,"The article that is published is actually pretty hilarious, but I don't see how it can be any good to anyone to do in a state where we are a democracy."
35,22,"Vaccination is a mandate to a government that has a bad job to do, so it's not a joke."
45,22,I'm not a lawyer and this is a pretty common question here.
60,22,"As a human being, I don’t think it’s funny for the CDC to do a good job keeping the people and communities safer. I think it’s hilarious that this was used by a CDC employee, that he is gonna be hurt and have no idea if it was a joke."
61,22,I've had the opportunity to read the last 2 AMAs I've been to in a very edgy way.
63,22,In the future it would be very difficult for the public to become a bit of a doctor and to even have a symptom. A simple mask in a neoprosthetic will be enough for a lot of people and can essentially put on a permanent mask. The real thing is that you could be working in the CDC or in a clinic because if they get sick they can't even do anything about it.
70,22,"Yes, it is a joke, and it makes them look bad to some extent. But it's also a joke because if you say something that makes you mad and angry, you're not trying to make it funny."
72,22,"People are being downvoted because they don't understand what is going on here. People are being downvoted because they don't understand what is going on, so they are being downvoted because it makes sense. I am trying to be more clear to the sexist side."
73,22,"A lot of people have been reporting that a mask is causing a large number of fatal illness. Then when they don't have an answer, the question is whether a mask is the only way to stop it."
91,22,The NRA is a terrorist organization. The NRA is a terrorist group. They have gotten some very sweeping blowbacks from the media.
101,22,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
22,1,I don't think you understand a lot of the comments on this one.
22,3,That's a huge question. What's the point of being in public?
22,4,I am trying to make the point that the CDC is a bad organization and the government is not allowed to do anything.
22,5,"People are being racist, not a joke."
22,11,"Because a mask doesn’t protect us from a virus or be a disease or prevents us from living, and we can’t protect our people from anything that doesn’t prevent disease or prevent disease, as long as we don’t use a mask. A mask is not something that can help prevent disease or prevent it, and it’s not something that can protect us from having to deal with the danger of illness, and a mask is something that can help us. It also protects us from having to go through a person who didn’t wear a mask or even thinking about"
22,12,Vaccines are not a way to prevent people from dying. Vaccines are a way to prevent people from dying. They aren't like vaccines. They are meant to protect us from the spread of a virus. Vaccines are a way to prevent health risks. They aren't like vaccines. They are meant to protect us from the spread of a virus. They aren't like vaccines. They are meant to protect us from the spread of the virus.
22,15,A man has a prank on someone he believes is a joke. He is an asshole for the joke.
22,21,"This is a joke, not a joke."
25,22,"Vaccination is a serious health issue. It's not a joke, but it has to be done."
34,22,"""I think wearing a mask in public is a big part of stopping the spread of a virus. This isn't about the mask. It's about what you can do to make a person better."""
35,22,It's not a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.
45,22,I don't see any danger in wearing a mask outside or in the car.

70,22,"I don't think you have the answers to the question, but I think the point is that the president is saying that if he doesn't wear a mask, he shouldn't be being treated as racist."
72,22,"I'm sorry, but I think that is the main reason. I think it's a good idea to have a joke about a skunk wearing a mask, which may be a joke as well."
73,22,"It sounds like this is a joke and a big deal. But as it turns out, the EPA doesn't use any masks to stop the spread of a virus. They haven't been using any."
91,22,What is the point of having a mask that is used to get a skunk's head off?
101,22,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."

22,15,"I mean, this isn't funny, a prank on a skunk is not funny."
22,21,"Vaccines are not a way to prevent diseases, they aren't about prevention and prevention of infectious diseases."
25,22,"That's a good one, but I like the one where people are petty and they say they don't know what they're getting at."
34,22,"Yes, it is an absolute joke. What's it about? The CDC's response is not that ""i think wearing a mask in public is a big part of stopping the spread of a virus."" It's that people who wear it in public are covered in a mask that isn't a joke. It's about what you can do to make a person better."""
35,22,"Is it the EPA that is saying, ""The ACA is not really a joke, just not a joke. I think they're going to try to do something about it to try to control public health."""
45,22,"I think I've seen plenty of ""Masked Nerds"" online - people wearing a mask to prevent virus spread are just people who don't like them, and that's the kind of people that'd just start playing the role of the other people to get a better feeling for themselves."
60,22,I feel the article is completely apathetic to someone who is getting the jokes.
61,22,"I've come to realize that when a government is threatening to cut access to a vaccine, it can actually use a huge amount of time and money to protect patients and their families. It's basically a very easy way to keep the government from sabotaging health care."
63,22,"I'm a student at a university, and I've read a number of articles that are misleading and incorrect about this whole problem. A teacher is very rude and I don't understand that."

22,4,I don't know why I think a guy pranking someone into wearing a mask is a joke.
22,5,Vaccines are about preventable diseases. They are not about prevention and prevention of infectious diseases.
22,11,"The story of a person on the internet with a mask made me think, ""He wears a mask because he doesn't care about the virus being spread. And she wasn't sure if she had been vaccinated or not."""
22,12,Vaccines aren't a way to prevent people from dying. They aren't like vaccines. They are meant to protect people from the spread of the virus.
22,15,A lot of people have been getting a sick joke. I think people are doing something to numb the population.
22,21,> What's the point of having a mask that is used to get a skunk's head off?
25,22,The joke is not a joke.
34,22,"This is the most upsetting one I have ever read. I've read it before, and thought about it quite a bit, but I don't think it is funny, it is a joke, and it's probably not, because people don't want to read it. It's just the thing: It's a joke and it's not what it is."
35,22,"A lot of people don't know how to say it, so they just don't know what it's called."
45,22,I would love to wear a mask to protect myself. I would like to wear a mask in public and not wear it is the only way to help prevent a virus.
60,22,It is a joke. It is a joke. It is a joke. I think it's funny for the government to do a good job keeping the people and communities safer. I think it's funny for the CDC to do a good job keeping the people and communities safer.
61,22,"What’s yours? “A little joke about the government is a joke. They’re a petty petty, and there are plenty of ways for the government to control public policy.”"
63,22,Vaccination is meant to help stop the spread of HIV/AIDS.

22,4,I don't see the problem. It's a joke.
22,5,"I think it's funny for the government to help stop the spread of HIV/AIDS, but for the public to see and act on it."
22,11,There is a lot of talk of using the term mask to define what is acceptable as a mask. People in the U.S. are fucking people with the idea that we need to go to work and get sick. A lot of it just goes on to label our society as terrorist groups.
22,12,"I don't care about the government, but it is a nice way to encourage and protect them. That's what I'm saying. I'd probably say that some of my friends are on my phone and that it's pretty funny."
22,15,This is one of the biggest political and economic issues in history. You can't just be a human prank.

22,4,The CDC is also not on the HHSID. They are not allowed to do anything.
22,5,Isn't it a joke?
22,11,I don't know why I'm posting this. It sounds like I'm at least one person who is joking and a dick at the same time. I don't think the CDC is a good company.
22,12,"I'm a member of the National Health and Safety Council. I just found out that if someone had a health issue that didn't get a vaccine, their doctor would have to give them a mask to go along with it, and that if they didn't have a vaccination, they'd have to do it at some point. The government could have a few more options, and that's it."
22,15,"I am not a racist, I am an idiot."
22,21,I don't think he's trying to be racist.

91,22,It's a great story that explains how the EPA and NRA are working together. It's also a great way to bring about a national emergency without having to worry about getting a skunk out of your head.

22,5,"My wife and I wear a mask to get tested when we go to the clinic to get tested. So if it was me, I'd be wearing a mask because of it. I'm not going to get the vaccine unless I'm sick. And the government is not allowed to make any decisions."
22,11,You need to know that people who don't wear masks need to be paid to be on a mask. It's a really important issue.

61,22,"I like how he is saying that he is a very intelligent person. I don't even think he is saying that, in fact he does not know how to properly equate his personal life with his own."
63,22,It is a joke. The CDC is trying to stop the spread of the virus. Is there an alternative or not? I am guessing the answer would be to have a sex with someone or not in your own country. The CDC is being a troll.
70,22,"The article says the president needs to go away from wearing a mask, but it's also not exactly true because the president is trying to change the law and he has said it in the article."
72,22,"The article says that the CDC is trying to bolster the CDC’s work to prevent the spread of hsid and a mask will help prevent the spread of the virus. There are different ways to prevent Hsid, and a mask doesn’t help. But the CDC and CDC also have other programs to protect people who are on the line to prevent the spread.

22,21,I read an article about this. The CDC ripped it off in the early 90's. This is actually a really big issue and the CDC is trying to change it.

60,22,The article says that the government is trying to smear the government and its policy makers. It's ridiculous.
61,22,The article was made about the US government as well. The AMA was about how they are using the CDC to help prevent the spread of the virus. This isn't a joke. It is about the government. This is the government that is making fun of the government.
63,22,"> The point of the ACA is to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. The point of the ACA is to prevent a disease and if people don't get the virus, they can't vaccinate them. It is a joke. The CDC erects masks around all public buildings for people who want to wear them."

60,22,AMA with Scott is a prank and it's basically a joke and I'm not a conservative either.
61,22,The first quote is the best of all times. It sounds like the CDC was trying to keep the federal government out of the public sector.
63,22,That is a joke. It's a joke. A joke.

22,12,I'm just being a little cynical about the CDC. I'm pretty sure the CDC has a list of racist racist jokes and they don't even try to make a joke out of it.

35,22,In terms of a joke:
45,22,"It's a joke, which makes it more sense because it's being used to scare people to save themselves and their health."
60,22,"That's really funny, but the joke is really funny."
61,22,"It is a joke, and it isn't in reference to the government. I think you need to understand it and know that there is a good reason to keep the government in power."
63,22,The government should just have some real abolition and stop making all of these nonsense jokes.
70,22,"That's what's been tagged as a remark, iirc. I'm really surprised that the entire conversation about the president is so over-the-top that it's not even on my radar."
72,22,Isn't this something that Trump and other Republicans are trying to push to get rid of?
73,22,I'm a huge advocate of vaccines and it's a joke that the EPA isn't using a mask.

22,4,"Yes, it's a joke, but not really the idea of a joke."
22,5,AMA is not a joke. AMA is a joke. AMA is a joke. AMA is a joke. AMA is a joke. AMA is a joke. AMA is a joke.
22,11,I feel a lot of people need to know that people who don't wear masks need to be paid to be on a mask. I feel like they should be paid to be on a mask if it is an actual precaution. That's one of the major problems the CDC has with the CDC.
22,12,"I feel so guilty. I'm not saying that a CDC mask is the best idea, but I also feel that the CDC is a bad idea and not that the CDC is a good idea."
22,15,I think the most interesting question about a person's stance on a country's health system is whether or not they have a right to wear a mask - one that is actually quite important to society - should be if they're just in a position to have it.
22,21,"""We're all making jokes about this. The ACA is a joke, and the AMA was written by Dr. Dre. Dr. Heeb, and it's very obvious that they're not going to be able to do so. There's nothing wrong with being a joke. I'm not an idiot. I just think it's a joke."

34,22,There's no such thing as a joke.
35,22,"I’m a physician. I’ve been sick for nearly two years now. It’s very uncomfortable, and I can’t bear to wear a mask in my work.

I threw away my mask for almost 3 years until I got sick again and got sick and had to take a cold, because I’m not an asshole. I was a very young nurse. The CDC seems to"
45,22,I can't even say this is a prank - it is a prank and the CDC is doing nothing about it.
60,22,AMA: There is a joke
61,22,Vaccination is a joke. It's not a joke. ACA repeal is a joke. It's not a joke.
63,22,"There’s an argument for what is a joke and not a joke. Isn’t it funny, because if someone was sick of them twirling their hands and saying it’s funny it would be funny?"
70,22,>The second part of the article is that he did not quote any of the comments to be racist.

22,5,"ACA is a joke, but it also is a joke. It's not funny if you don't know anything about the health system that makes you sick. The AMA is a joke and it is a joke."

22,21,The CDC is also being abused by blacks for not wearing any sort of mask.
25,22,"I don't know that's any joke. I know the joke is pretty cliche, and I think it's hard to tell when you're talking about a joke and the AMA is more a joke."
34,22,"I was in the hospital. My grandfather got sick in a car accident after seeing someone with HIV. He did some kind of training about the AIDS vaccines and then they came to my home, got tested for it, and were asked if he knew how it would work."
35,22,The CDC was a joke to a point.
45,22,Vaccination isn't a joke. It's a joke.
60,22,It is a joke. It is a joke.
61,22,You don't know how a joke works?
63,22,You do realize that the government does have the right to do abolition of all the jokes. It is part of the ACA and part of the ACA is to prevent the spread of a virus. You don't know much about the ACA. If you were a medical professional you would know more about what the ACA was and the situation the CDC would be dealing with.
70,22,"I'd like to add that that's how the meme was designed, to illustrate the context of the post. That is, it doesn't seem like it has anything to do with the president being racist."
72,22,I'd like to add that he's very happy for them to go into the AMA.
73,22,I don't like wearing my mask. I can't help but think I am a huge advocate of vaccines. It seems like I'm being a troll a little too much.
91,22,There's no other thing that can be done to stop the spread of the disease if not a mask. There is nothing about how it works and how it works.
101,22,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
22,1,People who have not seen the AMA have been having a rough time of it. I don't really understand why this joke doesn't make it to the AMA. But it seems like it's actually kind of like the AMA itself. It just isn't going to be much different from the one where you're being a dick.
22,3,The article is misleading and misleading.
22,4,It's not a joke. It's a joke.
22,5,"People who questioned the ACA were told this is a joke, and that a government can do whatever they want and not censor it. There is a lot of people who think it's a joke, but the public knows what they're talking about."
22,11,"CANNOTANSWER is the CDC's head of research and policy, and he's the only one who has ever elicited an opinion on a question regarding the ACA's health care reform."
22,12,"We are all on the same page, we just need a conversation about the truth and what a joke it is."
22,15,I don't understand why he would wear one if the CDC wanted him to. I think this would be a great joke.
22,21,"Vaccines are a joke, not a joke."
25,22,">I am a doctor. I don't want to be a politician, but I can tell you that what I'm getting at is a joke. The people that comment on this are actually hating on the government for not removing the CDC’s 'emergency’ of preventing this from happening.',"
34,22,"If you're going to be a funny guy, I'd be right here."
35,22,What's wrong with wearing a mask?
45,22,The CDC and the CDC have worked together for years to make that a reality for all Americans. The health care system has gotten better and better - we need more people and more money. So putting on a mask is more important than the truth.
60,22,"There's a joke about the federal government getting into an economic and political crisis and that's all we have there. A joke about how people get infected and need to be protected. But in the end, the ACA is an absurdly dangerous and unwise way to stop the spread of a virus."
61,22,"I want to point out that the ACA isn't a joke, but it was put in place with a purpose."
63,22,The government doesn't want to go down the same path if they don't want to.
70,22,"> I have a pretty nice relationship with a bunch of white people that don’t know who they are, or who’s like their wives, or their children/mothers."
72,22,The headline's misleading and misleading.
73,22,"""The whole hat joke is a joke. It is a joke because it's a commercial shaming and a joke."
91,22,">I’m not sure what the issue is. I see it as one of those cases in which the government is trying to make their people seem like ""incompetent people"" and their own people don’t really care how good they are at putting their own life in danger. The NRA is a horrible company. They are suing the government because they are trying to make the government look stupid."
101,22,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
22,1,It's a joke. I don't see any reason to be racist. I think the AMA is just a joke about how the CDC has not taken any action to stop the spread of the virus.
22,3,The article also points out the misinformation in the article and the AMA about the AMA.
22,4,It's a joke if it's actually an interesting issue and I'd like to start with this:
22,5,"""People who questioned the ACA are being racist, not a joke."""
22,11,People who questioned the ACA have been having a rough time of it. I don't really understand why this joke doesn't make it to the AMA.
22,12,"No, I don't think it's a joke, it's a joke."
22,15,Vaccines are not really a joke and a prank is an acceptable way of doing so.
22,21,Vaccines are about prevention and prevention of infectious diseases.
25,22,I don't think the AMA is funny at all.
34,22,"I'm a little irritated with the jokes. But as a fellow guy here, I have to say: I can't get into it."
35,22,"They are trying to do a prank about this. If the president doesn't want to stop it, he won't. It's not a joke, it's a prank. It's a joke. The ACA has no power over public health. It's just a joke."
45,22,"Vaccination isn't legal. Vaccination isn't mandated by the gov't. There are many reasons to have a mask on and why you don't. There's a difference between ""as a politician who wants to scare people to save themselves and their health""."

22,12,The CDC will not take a joke to the White House. The only thing I can do is to smear on someone because I'm a Democrat and that's not a joke. Vaccines are a way to protect people from dying.

25,22,"The question is, how do we deal with this?"
34,22,I would be happy to hear that you were given an AIDS vaccine and have been given it.
35,22,I'm not sure what the hive mind is going through right now.
45,22,"Vaccination is a joke, and a prank."
60,22,I think the joke is a joke because people aren't comfortable with it and the government is making it out to be a joke. I don't think it's funny.

72,22,I feel as if a lot of the above are real and I don't understand. You can't even argue about how stupid you are to say a joke. But I don't see a point in the whole thing.
73,22,The only way to stop the spread of a virus is to have it on your face and on your head. I don't care what you're thinking about.
91,22,"This is a lot of different issues to discuss in this issue, and the AMA section is all about ""what is the point of having a mask that is used to get a skunk's breath out of the back of his head."""

22,21,What's wrong with a joke?
25,22,The first sentence just sounds like a joke. The second line sounds like a joke.
34,22,"This article sounds like a joke about the government, not the CDC."
35,22,The CDC and the CDC have a very different perspective on this issue. They are not attempting to stop spread of AIDS. They are trying to discourage people from getting vaccinated. They are not doing something about it.

60,22,Is there a way you can get the mask off of people who don't wear it? Because if it's a joke i think the government is trying to smear the government and its policy makers.

73,22,"People do, however, believe that vaccines are needed by the people in charge. Those people are being treated like shit and need a doctor. And the government is using a hat to stop a virus? Those are some serious risks."

22,15,CANNOTANSWER:
22,21,AMAs are supposed to be used to stop people from getting vaccinated. It's not a joke.
25,22,"They're all for the government. It's a joke. There is no reason to go outside, even if you don't have a vaccinated person. And it is illegal. In the USA, a vaccinated person is not a member of a government. There is no reason for them not to be in a position that isn't vaccinated. Those people do not have the appropriate protection from the government."
34,22,The wording of the article is also a joke.
35,22,This was a joke. And it is. They are not trying to change it.
45,22,"""An ACA is a joke, but not enforceable. Vaccination isn't a joke because it's an inappropriate treatment of an infectious disease. It's not a 'big deal' for the government to force it."

63,22,Is it the joke that's going to have a big impact on this country? Especially when it's about AIDS.
70,22,I don’t think the AMAs are accurate. I’m not certain what you are trying to say here is going to be true. What I am trying to say is that the entire story is being utterly ridiculous. I can’t imagine being in a position to justify the AMAs being wrong.
