71,3,I was in the army and I went there with my friends every day. We went to the airport to pick them up. They used to walk me everywhere with a mask and then they walked away from the bus. They got away with it but they never told me I needed to get off and if I wore it for about three hours I would walk away. When I came back we put on a helmet and a mask...
71,7,"I had a really good friend that once wore a mask. He was super protective, and we didn't have to get the whole thing back on the ground. So he said that wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."

71,38,"It carries a certain amount of semblance of sarcasm, but it is not the most general term used by the government in the US. The ""covid"" word has been a widely used quote throughout history.

71,3,This is actually a good question. You said you were coming to a country where it is possible to spread a virus and you were living in a country with a virus in your head.
71,7,"I'm a Georgian, i'm a Georgian."
71,24,"He was speaking of the US government, and the ""goverment"" who has no authority in the fight against a virus. I think that's something that most people would agree with. But I don't see any reason to believe that the government is the authority."
71,34,Is this what the guy who spoke in the movie said in the movie? Is this what it would be like to live in the UK?
71,37,"He said you can go on a bus and walk around without a mask. He says it would be easier if you were just walking around. Then he said that if you didn't, you could go go in a completely different direction."
71,38,"I don't know about Georgia, but there's a wiki page devoted to this, called The Facts of the State."
71,45,"I had to use that phrase when I was a kid, but I always went back home with my girlfriend to go look for the scar and a nice mask. I just wanted to make sure everyone else knew it.

71,24,"Honestly, the US government is a pretty terrible place to live. The rest of the world just isn't as clean or healthy as we would like."
71,34,"This is a cliched phrase. That was the same thing you described, but the wiki page is full of a list of examples."

I've been to Georgia many times and have heard all of the comments about Georgians using the ""cliche"" phrase. I was in the UK when the movie came out, and the scene where the person was in a mask gave a much different look to them than the movie was in the movie, and I found it more interesting than the movie, albeit with an accent, a woman wearing a mask."

71,24,I think he is trying to take advantage of that.
71,34,"i agree that the US government isnt very clean or healthy, but in the US, there is less of it."
71,37,I don't think people are joking about the fact that Georgia is a terrible place to live.
71,38,It was my friend who mentioned that we were both from Georgia and a part of the US military. He was just describing that they were not going to be doing a better job of tackling HIV because they were not sure they had enough resources to handle them and that it would be very hard for them to handle the problems at the U.S. border.
71,45,>Making a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
71,47,This is the correct answer for you.
71,48,It sounds like it is coming out of the US.
71,55,"I'm from Georgia and I love wearing a mask. Then when my friend asked if I could wear my mask at school I went to a school and everyone said, ""Yeah, it's about the money and I want to get out and have fun. I want to make my life better.""

71,3,"People who live in the US can relate to this quote, or if the government is not doing anything for the country they're in, they are just using the word mask in an attempt to gain attention. It's a really good thing they have a hard time understanding that the government has no authority to address the HIV epidemic and they're all in the same boat. I think that it's a good thing, and I think that's the right answer for you."
71,7,"There are some really good, even better, stories out there."
71,24,The people in the ad are actually the same. The government is a horrible place to live. The rest of the world isn't as clean or healthy as we would like.
71,34,It's about money and fun and a bad time to be homeless a lot of the time. You're a pretty average person.
71,37,I'm very confused about what it means to go to college. And what does it mean to live in Georgia? What does it mean to live in Georgia?
71,38,A lot of people that have been to Georgia have been to Georgia and have been to Florida and Florida. Some are unsure if they are a part of the government or if they are just making it clear to others that they are not from Georgia.
71,45,It's all about the money. It's all about the money.
71,47,I love the quote. I get it.
71,48,"This is one of those things that when you try to look for it is a big red flag and it sounds like they've got all the info that's required for that job.

71,61,>I think he is trying to take advantage of that. I think people are joking about the fact that the US government is a pretty terrible place to live.
71,62,I can't wait for my next trip to Georgia.
71,66,"I would have been very surprised to learn that there are some people in Georgia who wear masks because of the pity that they are being reported to be a little older than they are. In my country, it can be really tricky to get a man around in the US if his family isn't already doing it. I am not surprised there are people who wear masks because of what they see around them."

71,45,I'm not sure if the joke is real.
71,47,I can't find a single reference to this. The only reason I'm trying to get into the thread is because I can't find anything related to Georgians.
71,48,"I'd say the most likely answer here is ""I don't care if it's okay to make a life better and want to help. I don't care what the government does or doesn't do."""

71,3,"There's a lot of bad humor, but in this context, I think it's actually about the situation."
71,7,I think wearing a mask in public is pretty amazing. The premise is very ghetto. It's too big of a red flag.
71,24,You might be able to get an interview with an attorney.
71,34,I don't think there's much left to be said for this.
71,37,"No one here would know how I would feel if I left Georgia, but I've been to Georgia and it's on my bucket list of things to do. I have never done a job there and I'm looking for a job there. I'm sorry I can't find something to do. But if I was to leave I'd be so upset that my family is leaving and I'd get caught up in this."
71,38,"I am a Georgian myself and I can tell you I don't want to be like you, I do want to be like you."
71,45,"“We are not trying to make a situation worse, it's just that we haven't been able to stop the spread of a virus. We have just stopped people from eating and drinking. Then we get the news on the local news and have a job interview. We're starting to have a better feeling about ourselves. “We can’t help you when it comes to the economy. I’ve had good luck in Georgia because I’m a good guy. I can’t wait for my next trip to Georgia”"

71,66,"This is an interesting post about how Georgia is very much a place to live. The people there aren't that far away from the famine. They seem to be going to Georgia in order to find a job.

71,3,We have to talk about the virus.
71,7,The article claims it was made at the time of the filming. It's a very interesting premise and I'm glad the movie has got a few good quotes from different parts of the country.
71,24,"There are so many things people have done, including taking pictures of the food, getting married, and getting divorced. People are just a bunch of people who can't be able to afford to move."
71,34,People can be cruel. We could be mean or nasty to people. Is it OK to be a good guy and help the poor?
71,37,I am a guy. I have been to so many places in my life. I've never been so desperate to move to something better. I want to go to the government so badly and I want to help them to live on my own. I also want to learn to work in the ghetto and try to take care of myself.
71,38,"As a Georgian, you are not correct."
71,45,"My cousins married to women who didn't live in the country. And the whole ""We're going to die"" thing is a funny one to hear."

71,61,No I am a nerd. I like to think that I have been reading through some of these posts and I have found it to be very helpful. This is very pertinent. Thank you.
71,62,I think he's being serious. A lot of people in the US have seen the government.
71,66,People think people hate people and hate to leave the US. The US government is a horrible place to live. The rest of the world just isn't as clean or healthy as we would like.

71,48,I'm not joking. I'm not being serious.
71,55,The first two words from the article don't have anything to do with the subject.
71,61,I think it is one of the most pathetic things about the US government.
71,62,"You seem to be implying that there isn't some kind of relationship between the two of you. The word mask isn't an issue. It's a word that describes the whole ""fight of the savages"" thing. It's the only way to get around that. It's not a question, it's a question. It is a question. It is a question. It is a question. It's a question. The question is how do we actually do this?"

71,37,I've said this before and was confused about it but what it's really saying is: the government is a terrible place to live. The rest of the world just isn't as clean or healthy as we would like.
71,38,I can't really tell you how many people understand the cliche or what it means.
71,45,I'm sorry this got to the bottom of my head.
71,47,What's the difference between a mask and a mask?
71,48,I'd suggest you read the article and just take a breath. The first is a sarcastic rant. The second is a long one.
71,55,I have not heard of this movie.
71,61,The article isn't really about the US government but the situation itself.
71,62,"I am a georgia nurse, and I've been on several different countries. I grew up in a very harsh place. There was no official way I could communicate, and I would tell them the exact same way about their work. I did not need an escort to get to them. I didn't care.

71,24,It doesn't sound like the government really cares about stopping the spread of a virus. I'd like to point out that the article is not about the US government and doesn't address any of this because of some very stupid thing.

71,24,It's easy to make a point but it's difficult to do so. If people were to have a bad time they would likely want to use the word masks. I'd say that's a really dumb idea but I think the premise of the article is the fact that the government has no authority.
71,34,I've been trying to find a way to communicate in a way that I don't have to explain.
71,37,"That is a good point. I think that people are being stupid and not expressing an opinion that makes sense, but I don't think this is what the article is referencing."
71,38,A bit over a hundred people have heard about this. There is some interesting facts here in that the US has decided to make it illegal for the people to wear a mask and it isn't really the right thing to do.
71,45,I think the issue here is that you don't need to wear a mask to be an impotent asshole. The government can't help.
71,47,"That's an interesting point, but the title is a bit too savage."
71,48,"Is there a ""death"" or ""an actual death"" in the US, or does it have any sort of ""unique meaning""?"
71,55,"I just have to say, in the end, that the whole point of the article was that ""the question was, where do you live?"

We even had a few friends who were working there and the job was ok. We went on an internship, and they were all good, and they gave us jobs and helped us keep our money, but I did not work.
