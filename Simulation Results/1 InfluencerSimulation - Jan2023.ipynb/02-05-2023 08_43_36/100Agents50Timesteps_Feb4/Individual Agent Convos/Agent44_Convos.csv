44,27,"Oh yes, a little sourness there, btw."
44,38,This is a pretty basic idea that most politicians have not yet developed. I don't think they will realize what is possible if they stop thinking about what we've already done. It's part of their plan to combat a virus before it becomes a problem. They would be better off not thinking about what's really happening and just ignoring that.
56,44,I hate to give an opinion but you do have a point.
60,44,"This is a joke. You should never wear a mask and your life is over, and you can't do that."

56,44,Why don't you wear a mask for your safety. This is a mask for people who are sick and sick - just like everyone else is. It's like you're describing a guy who is sick and sick - he has a mask and hasn't tried to change his mask. :P

44,38,"If you get a little too attached, you're not going to get much - you're a dick."
56,44,"You're actually describing the government as a tool to prevent someone from having HIV. It's not the government's job to help prevent the disease, it's the government's job to keep people from having HIV. It's a good idea to tell people that wearing a mask to protect yourself, it just isn't practical for everyone. If the government wanted to do something like that, they would have to give the person a license and license, that's why the government could prevent them from having HIV, and I'm not going to make a mistake."

56,44,This is an interesting OP's question about how to get the government to help people who are in the hospital and are at risk of getting the virus.
60,44,Vaccination is not mandatory for everyone unless the person is in an advanced stage of a clinical trial.
