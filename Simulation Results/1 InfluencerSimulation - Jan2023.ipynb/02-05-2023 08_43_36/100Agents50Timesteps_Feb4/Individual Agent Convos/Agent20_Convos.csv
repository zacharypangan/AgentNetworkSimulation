89,20,yes the newest strain is soooooo contagious just bc they have a mask on their hands pics don t mean they re using it
27,20,"I’m a fan of vaccinating kids, I can say I grew up with a big brother who does not wear a mask at all."
35,20,I see the same thing happening with the kids. I think a lot of people with masks wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus.
37,20,I hate to say it but I feel like the only way we can do that is through the president. He needs to get out of the house and the state legislature to end all of this.
41,20,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
47,20,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
48,20,IANAL : I have been a coach at a state university for almost 30 years and my friend says she gets a new one.
55,20,Wearing a mask to protect yourself is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
79,20,"To me, the way that a man does is the opposite of the way a man is to the people he tries to manipulate a lawful entity he believes is unjust. And a man has no right to take back the rights of his people. He has no right to make the rules or to make laws. But the truth is that a man can and should do the right thing."
87,20,"There is a twitchcon that he would rather not participate in. A twitchcon is a public forum he can go to, and that should be able to meet his people."
89,20,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.yes the newest strain is soooooo contagious just bc they have a mask on their hands pics don t mean they re using it
27,20,What's the point of having a 'common sense'? It is one of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
35,20,Is the public wearing a mask or something?
37,20,i like the part when he got covid but still had events with people and how he won t enforce a statewide mask mandate
41,20,I don't like the way you think about masks.
47,20,"In Washington state, you're allowed to wear a mask, and it's allowed in certain areas of the country where there is a large number of people with allergies."
48,20,"Well, I want to tell you this. I want to get your mask off so I don't get in trouble."
55,20,The people of Georgia do not wear masks at all.
79,20,The first part is pretty interesting.
87,20,It's a symptom of the onset of a viral infection. It doesn't matter if you're vaccinated.
89,20,I'd rather not be wearing a mask at work because it would make me feel dirty. I could go to the bathroom because I'd get hot and have to take some medicine. I'd wear something like a mask in public for the rest of my day.

35,20,I believe this to be an official post about what I hate about the government as well.
37,20,"I know that's a lot of people, but that's kind of a stretch. I'm just asking for some kind of generalization for the situation and the part of people that want to make a generalization that is essentially ""Making a mask"" is a very common misconception."
41,20,I'm a big fan of this kind of thing. You are trying to discredit the apocalypse movement for not taking a stand against the mask.
47,20,"I wore a mask to get sick, it was a really cool feeling that got in the way of the whole virus thing."
48,20,"I'm a guy who's on the left at a party like this, even if he tries."
55,20,"The people of Georgia do not wear masks at all. In the U.S. the word ""fake"" comes from ""fake."""
79,20,Is it any different from your post on the subject. Is it related to the fact that the OP is against the mandates because they ruin the economy?
87,20,"Vaccination is a huge and costly disease. It doesn't matter if you're vaccinated. Vaccination is a huge and costly disease, and isn't the only reason a person is unable to get the vaccine in the first place."
89,20,"It's not only in a medical emergency that people who wear a mask in public, wear a mask at their workplace, but in many other situations (such as in emergency situations), I have to wear a mask in public and it's really no different than not wearing one. I know there's a lot of other people who wear a mask, but if a person is sick, it will still be sick, if not the other way around, so if I wear a mask, I'm not going to get sick. I have no idea what a "
27,20,What a jerk. I'm not joking. It's more like this : a fucking troll who thinks you have a legitimate idea of the government.
35,20,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.IANAL but I have worked for a public hospital and we had no issue wearing a mask - a very unattractive thing to do when going through an emergency situation.
37,20,"[[Baby taylor swift](http://www.w.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_by_sharp_and_advice_of_the_virus) A man who was taking a virus has a mask on his hand that works wonders when he's walked on his back. I mean, I did it in one of those films, too. But now I can't get my head around it. Is this an American political thing that happened in Texas when you were growing up?"
41,20,I think you are being an asshole.
47,20,I like a lot of people who don't want to get vaccinated because they don't have the money or the experience to wear a mask.
48,20,>What is a proper constitutional requirement that states and federal workers wear a mask?
55,20,"I think your comment was a bit misleading, in that they were not in any way hostile. I see you were in the wrong to mention the mask was part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
79,20,"There are many other things that are anti-government, like the “I wear a mask for an emergency” or the “I want to help someone who wants to know how to go about it” - such as:"

89,20,>I wear a mask when i'm in public lawmaker who isn't wearing his mask in public says oh you dont like wearing my mask I think you need to take a deep breath and rethink how you're going to do it.
27,20,There's a lot of people who aren't interested in a mask.
35,20,I agree with everyone saying that masks are too good for your health. But it is also very dangerous. They are being used to protect people in the future and they need to make you look nice.
37,20,You can always be in a public health clinic and have them do a “shelf-test” and see if there are any health risks.
41,20,Is there another way you can get people to go? Because it's a very common excuse.
47,20,">Is this one of those times you can't use a mask to stop the spread of a virus. I think you don't understand why it is so obvious to the majority that people are still able to get an A. It is a great reason to support the EPA and the NRA. They're all stupid. Why not make this more relevant? If you don't like them, tell them. Or if you want to be the best and just stay a dick about it, stop making the point."
48,20,This is a classic quote from a book that I would read again and again in a new language. I think it sounds more like it would come out of the US.
55,20,That's not a problem. It's not the government that's trying to stop the spread of a virus.
79,20,That was pretty interesting. What do you think about the 'The first part is pretty interesting'?
87,20,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
89,20,"If I were in a law firm, I would wear a mask to help spread a virus."
27,20,Vaccination does help prevent some of the spread of a virus. They just don't want to go where they want. It's not a serious issue at all.
35,20,"I don't know if this is true. If I was going to ask you what you mean by wearing a mask when in fact I thought you were a dick. That said, I think this is a very good answer. I think we should start seeing ""masks in a public place"" which is not something to get to the point of it being a good idea to go for a test drive and to ask what a good idea they are."
37,20,"I think you should stop smoking tobacco, especially as it seems like this doesn't work."
41,20,I don't understand why you are assuming this is the only time you're being an asshole. It's because of a myth. I've always been a strong anti-spyware voter so my comment wasn't wrong in any way. I'm just trying to figure out why the government didn't try to help the victims.
47,20,i think it's the whole reason for us to protect ourselves from getting sick
48,20,i have to stop talking about the law in general.
55,20,What if there isn't a virus in the world? It sounds like the government just wants to protect us from the government if they don't get it and make us suffer.
79,20,>I think that's pretty interesting.
87,20,The first part is all but confirmed.
89,20,I think this has to do with your state's willingness to support this kind of rhetoric. This is just so unhelpful.
27,20,"A hat in the car is illegal in many states because it is used in public areas, with the person in the car not wearing a mask in the car being covered in a protective layer, not the place it was made in. Vaccination does help prevent some of the spread of a virus."
35,20,"Is it possible that the government does not recognize that a person's skin is being used for a vaccine to spread the virus, or does it allow people to get to the hospital with a mask because it's part of the vaccination program?"
37,20,A lot of people aren't really interested in the topic and they are also just trying to talk it off as a generalization.
41,20,"IANAL, but I am an old-timer, and the first comment is the one I had to make. I am a Republican and it's not like I'm the only one that has done that."
47,20,It seems like the government is trying to do more than just protect people.
48,20,I would not know this person's motivation for this.
55,20,"In the US, the word ""fake"" comes from ""fake."", ""I think your comment was a bit misleading, in that they were not in any way hostile. I see you were in the wrong to mention the mask was part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. They are a part of the US military and they aren't going to change the subject because they are unable to get their own health insurance."
79,20,"In addition to the petty jokes, there are many people who are able to find someone who can actually take the moral and moral responsibility of the people to the point where they cannot be taken seriously."
87,20,That's a bit more confusing than just the last one.
89,20,>Why do you think the people who are a good Democrat who like to wear a mask in the workplace are a bad one?
27,20,I think the article goes on to state that the EPA and NRA have no authority to change the health care system.... But that's probably why it's a big problem.
35,20,"I don't know about the virus itself, but I do know about the people who wear a mask and that it's a good idea to wear it when you get sick."
37,20,This is a huge problem for many reasons. It's pretty obvious that this is a problem for many reasons.
41,20,"I think it's better to not wear a mask, because that means there are some people who need to have a conversation about how to stop a virus spread."
47,20,"I think it's a great reason to support the EPA and the NRA. They're all stupid. Why not make this more relevant? If you don't like them, tell them. Or if you want to be the best and just stay a dick about it, stop making the point."
48,20,I'm a little sceptical on this topic. I'm a coach at a state university who does this for free. I don't think that masks help the spread of the virus.

89,20,"There are so many ways you could be a nutjob about the government, and you are essentially making an unpopular point. You've been told that the government is only interested in controlling the spread of HIV/AIDS, not to do so to ensure that people who rely on masks are vaccinated for it.

It's just what the people who do this to the government."
27,20,"There's a lot of the wrong people here. People who don't want to be a doctor just don't get the time to think about that. I don't see why the government hasn't changed health care.

79,20,There's a lot of pranks on the internet. It's very clear that there are a lot of things a people don't like about the government a little. It's an anti-government/police thing. Is it funny? Is it funny? Because the government wants to emasculate people who may be disabled and sick if they aren't wearing masks and fucking are wearing them to be safe? Are the government policies to protect them better?
87,20,"""Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."

He's talking about the ""constant threat of HIV and the use of the internet"" and his ""hat"" is an example of the very problem."
35,20,No. The story's about a group of people whose wives supposedly get HIV/AIDS while they're at home doing a snorting operation. That's the one I got when I went to the doctor's office. My wife was also sick so she didn't see anyone snoring in a mask.
37,20,The president needs to get out of the house and the state legislature to end all of this.
41,20,So your first comment wasn't wrong?
47,20,I'm trying to stop the government from repressing the issue by putting on a mask.
48,20,"I didn't watch the video, but there was a bit of a joke in there."
55,20,It sounds like they are using a joke that doesn’t make sense and is not a joke.
