    "Almost all of these people are aware of the fact that the NFL is being sued by the health care department, and it does not sound like a problem that needs to be solved. I agree that a doctor's appointment should not be a problem in the NFL, but that the NFL and the healthcare reform movement should work on things as directed.",

Vaccination, vaccination and healthcare reform are not problems, and the health care system has been putting a lot of strain on the health care system for decades. I think this is just an attempt to get things moving in the right direction.",
    "As a fan of the NFL, and I think this was so bad I wanted to be very skeptical of their attitude towards vaccines and I thought they were very unpopular. But then they came in and sued me and got a ticket and I cried for about a week and they didn't respond. So, I had to move on. I think I'm just tired and insecure. I'm sick and I feel I'm dying every time I go to the game.",

    "The CDC can't take care of a player without a mask - it's not an obvious violation of the federal law. That's not legal. It's illegal - the public doesn't have the right to vaccinate players and the federal government is unable to enforce it. It's not the health care system or anything like that. It's not the health care system, it's the people who are making money, and it's not legal.",
