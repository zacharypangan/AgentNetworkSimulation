100,96,i m going to say this about twitchcon and masks you can hate me if the state town doesn t have an mandates you can t get mad that an event doesn t not sure if sd has any mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask
101,96,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
96,6,"When a game comes to town and the team has a full head mask and helmets, I don't believe there is an official or a player who wears a mask."
96,8,"... and the implication is that you should try to put on a mask, or you should get a fucking mask, or a gtfo mask."
96,11,I just made a thread here and it's great. I haven't heard anything about wearing a mask or wearing a helmet for years. I am still trying to figure out what it is and where i can get a hood and some money in my pocket to buy a mask. And I know this isn't fair... but if I am not comfortable with it I can't buy a hood or anything.
96,21,"I have to be honest with you, I really don't get this either :)"
96,37,Why would the government have to enact mandates to prevent the spread of the virus?
96,39,Its a funny way to tell someone that the mask is needed when their team isn't playing. They aren't going to resign because of the mask or if a team doesn't have a helmet then they should be doing it properly.
96,45,>I love coaching however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops i love coaching

96,54,I feel like I have a lot of friends who hate the idea of being told to wear a mask while they play.
96,55,"I'd be shocked if I didn't stop wearing a mask, and then if I could I'd be doing the same."
96,66,"Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of a virus, it's useless and I hate it."

96,83,I have a ton of fans that will say the same things about me because I love watching and watching people wear their masks as well.
96,84,I'm not sure if they are mandates but in fact I'm more concerned with the nonsense that comes with it. The only thing I know about it is that there's a lot of skepticism a team has about the state allowing it. I guess I'm on the right track to make sure I don't get snooped into the fucking twitchcon/TwitchCon stuff to actually play.
96,91,> Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus

100,96,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

96,6,"... and the implication is that you should try to put on a mask, or you should get a fucking mask, or a gtfo mask."
96,8,Aww! i have to say this about TWitchcon/TwitchCon stuff to actually play.
96,11,Wearing a mask doesn't necessarily help in stopping the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask can help prevent it from spreading.
96,21,">I have to be honest with you, I really don't get this either :)"
96,37,What if someone has a virus? What if they don't? They can't even play. The government 'insulates' and protects them from virus-like conditions. The government will help prevent these conditions and then tell you to keep your head up.
96,39,You could actually get a helmet helmet for a guy like me.
96,45,>I love coaching however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops i love coaching.
96,48,"> When a game comes to town and the team has a full head mask and helmets, I don't believe there is an official or a player who wears a mask."
96,54,"Wearing a mask doesn't stop the spread of the virus. Wearing a mask does, however, stop the spread of the virus."
96,55,">I'd be shocked if I didn't stop wearing a mask, and then if I could I'd be doing the same. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
96,66,"Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of a virus, it's useless and I hate it."
96,68,So i'm going to tell you what I'm going to tell you about the state's mandatory mandates.
96,83,"I have a mask. I was just able to put on one with my booster and when it got too close to the end, it stopped bleeding and made my head hurt. I still hate it. I don't wear a mask at all."
96,84,It's not like we can't make this happen. We're getting sick and we're trying to get rid of it. We're going to be sick and we're going to be sick and the virus's spread is going to be there for us. We're going to have to have it stop. It won't stop. We'll just have to do what we can to get rid of it.
96,91,The state has a mandate to protect people from the spread of the virus.
96,94,"That's exactly what it is. A team, that hasn't had a team to match up for, doesn't know when to bring a full mask or helmet. They know what they're getting, and don't want their team's uniforms to show off."
100,96,Vaccination is not required for everyone unless the person is in an advanced stage of a clinical trial.
101,96,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
96,6,"I'm not sure you really believe it or have you read the article. But it seems like a big fucking shithole to me that the gov't's mandates to protect people from the spread of a virus are just so ridiculous, I can't even get away from the fact that it's so ridiculous."
96,8,The virus is a terrible thing to have. People get sick every day.
96,11,"Vaccination is not required for everyone unless the person is in an advanced stage of a clinical trial. Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of a virus, it's useless and I hate it."
96,21,Is it an actual law?
96,37,">A team, that hasn't had a team to match up for, doesn't know when to bring a full mask or helmet. They know what they're getting, and don't want their team's uniforms to show off. Vaccination is not required for everyone unless the person is in an advanced stage of a clinical trial."
96,39,"I had a team in my school that was so poorly equipped, that I was in no position to even wear a helmet if I had a problem."
96,45,I've never been to a game where I had to wear a mask and I actually didn't.
96,48,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
96,54,What if someone has a virus?
96,55,"There is no way that a mask helps prevent a virus, only prevents it from spreading."
96,66,"The ""what if someone has a virus?"" mentality is awful. When you have a virus, you dick it."
96,68,"What does the helmet say when you wear it,? Are they wearing a mask or a hoodie? Do you know why this is a topic on the front page? Because a helmet is necessary to prevent the spread of the virus, and you do not have to wear a helmet to prevent the spread of it. It is a government mandate that protects you from any kind of virus. Its not even a mandate, it is an exemption."
96,83,I do have a very similar story:
96,84,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
96,91,"Wearing a mask doesn't stop the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask doesn't help in stopping the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask does, however, stop the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask does, however, stop the spread of a virus."
96,94,"If a vaccine was mandated, and the players had a helmet or a mask, they would be the first to say it, or the first to admit they didn't wear it. Vaccination is not required for everyone unless the person is in an advanced stage of a clinical trial."
100,96,It doesn't make sense at all that I'll say something like this : I'll not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask
101,96,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
96,6,"If you don't want to go to games, you are obligated to go."
96,8,Vaccination is not required for everyone unless the person is in an advanced stage of a clinical trial.
96,11,"I'm pretty sure that there is a law if you want a uniform that is worn while playing football, but it's illegal in the US."
96,21,You've never been to a game where a helmet wasn't required.
96,37,"It's really not a bad idea, and it's not like they can have a full helmet on unless it's for the entire game. There's a difference between a normal helmet and a mask."
96,39,"I don't think there's anything shady about the helmet, but there's no way to imply that it prevents a virus and I don't see a need for a helmet. Its not something to just hide from the government, it is a good way to get people to show off. If you have a virus, you're going to need to tell your teammates to get them to wear one."
96,45,I can't say that.
96,48,"As a coach of a large professional soccer team and a medical professional, I agree that a helmet and a mask are an essential part of the federal law against the spread of the virus. They are the basic requirements for the defense industry."
96,54,Vaccination does not prevent the spread of a virus. Vaccination does not prevent the spread of a virus.
96,55,I think it makes sense that the gov't has a mandate to protect people from the spread of a virus and it would not be helpful if they did not have a mandate to wear a mask to stop it from spreading.
96,66,I have never been to a game where I had to wear a mask and actually didn't.
96,68,"What is the joke a person has that it says is ""the mandates that are mandatory""?"
96,83,They can't even get away from this. I'm not sure how this was a lot of work but it was really interesting that there is a governmental mandate that protects the individual from the spread of a virus and not everyone is required to wear a helmet in the military.
96,84,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
96,91,Vaccination is not required for everyone unless the person is in an advanced stage of a clinical trial.
96,94,"They can't be forced to wear a mask, because they can't afford it. In fact, wearing a mask doesn't prevent the spread of a virus. But even the gov't can tell the difference between being told what to wear and not wearing it."
100,96,Vaccination is not required for everyone unless the person is in an advanced stage of a clinical trial.
101,96,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
96,6,"I know you're thinking of people who think the gov't's mandates are ridiculous, but they don't actually say something to stop it from spreading, which they do in a lot of states. I'm not sure what you mean. If you want to reassure me that your team isn't willing to do the right thing, the gov't has the right to tell you that you don't want to go."
96,8,"I am a medical professional, and if I need to wear a mask for the rest of the season, I am a medical professional."
96,11,"Vaccination doesn't stop the spread of a virus. It prevents it from spreading. It's not helpful, but it does prevent the spread of a virus. It's not useless and I hate it."
96,21,"As an athlete, I have to point out that while we can't help stopping the spread of a virus by just wearing a mask, we can definitely help the government protect against it. I can't stand the idea of a game with the helmet on."
96,37,I think this is the best thing to happen when you become a professional.
96,39,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.It doesn't make sense at all that I'll say something like this :
96,45,"You are saying he was a doctor and wanted to go to a game where the gov't mandated a mask, not the football coach."
96,48,"There is not much that is wrong with this idea. We're on an international stage, and we're on a lot of fronts here."
96,54,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.It doesn't make sense at all that I'll say something like this : I'll not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask Wearing masks does not help in stopping the spread of the virus, it's useless and I hate it.

96,55,"It's called ""the mandates that are mandatory."" Basically, the government is basically a government organization."
96,66,Vaccination does not prevent the spread of a virus.
96,68,"The joke was that if you had to wear a mask or wear it properly under a helmet, you might not be allowed to wear a helmet for a while."
96,83,I can't wait to see a video of this in a game.
96,84,"The CIA has had to implement ""mandated"" measures to prevent spread of a virus, to prevent it from spreading. But now it is not the government's job to provide the CDC with the necessary funds to do so."
96,91,It was kind of hard to keep up with the actual legislation. We needed an official that would be responsible for the CDC to mandate a virus vaccine on the players. We needed a helmet. And this is why the government was so critical of them.
96,94,This is the only way you can stop being an asshole.
100,96,"I walked into a twitchcon event with a rash, and a piece of cardboard with a piece of cloth that was missing and a lot of stuff. I'm not sure why it doesn't make sense either."
101,96,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
96,6,Why would the CDC want the medical field to have a helmet at all?
96,8,"This is how they deal with the virus. There are a lot of rules about how to do it. For instance, the person who needs a mask cannot go anywhere without a mask."
96,11,"Wearing a mask or wearing a helmet doesn't stop the spread of a virus. It prevents it from spreading. It's not useful, but it does prevent the spread of a virus."
96,21,"[Also, the CDC is incredibly ill for not wearing a mask. It is not the best thing to happen when you become a professional.](http://www.twitchcon.com/news/nfl/news/nfl_context_file_name/news_report/nfl_context_report.htm)"
96,37,Vaccination is not necessary for everyone unless the person is in an advanced stage of a clinical trial. Wearing a mask doesn't help in stopping the spread of a virus.
96,39,I just realized that I don't want to be on a team where I can't wear a mask.
96,45,It's funny because this shit just hit me.
96,48,There's no question that the idea of a mask and a mask are essential to stopping the spread of a virus.
96,54,"It's called ""the mandates that are mandatory."""
96,55,Are you a lawyer? It's really the only way you can stop being an asshole.
96,66,"The question is, is it necessary for this guy to resign after a year of unprotected play, or can he just keep working and leave a mask on, or will it be a rite of passage? Or is it just something the government has to give him?"
96,68,"""So i'm going to tell you what I'm going to tell you about the state's mandatory mandates."", ""What does the helmet say when you wear it,? Are they wearing a mask or a hoodie?

96,83,Affirmative action is the best thing you can do. It is your choice.
96,84,It's pretty simple. Vaccination doesn't stop the spread of the virus. Vaccination does prevent it from spreading.
96,91,The government was critical of them when it was in power. Mostly because of it and because it was uncooperative for the US government to do this. I don't blame the NFL for their inability to stop the spread of the virus. I hate that the USA is the only state in the world where a politician can actually make laws for the sake of the US.
96,94,"Vaccination is not required for everyone unless the person is in an advanced stage of a clinical trial. Wearing a mask doesn't help in stopping the spread of a virus, it's useless and I hate it."
100,96,"The government, not the media, is implementing anti-vaccine measures in states where they have mandates to keep people vaccinated. Vaccination is not required for everybody. If they have no mandate, then the government can take any policy they want, and make sure that people aren't getting sick at the event or if the event is a public health event, or if there is an emergency."
101,96,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
96,6,"As a medical field employee, I know that some people are not going to take advantage of this, and there are some who do not have access to the basic protections."

96,11,"In some states, even when a vaccine is recommended, it can be used as a precaution."
96,21,I'm pretty sure the NFL is in the minority of states that require an infield helmet. They are just as inflexible about them as the rest of the country in terms of the law they implement.
96,37,I mean the NFL is so damn nasty to them.
96,39,"I love football. I love the football games and the nfl. I'm a huge fan of all kinds of sports, and I love the football. I'm just not a fan of any kind of sports."
96,45,I'm an advocate for the role of helmet in the protection of health care. I'm a defender. I've been able to get a sock in a glove and an air lube from my helmet.
96,48,"In my experience, the most important thing is to prevent the spread of a virus, because it causes a rash - because your immune system is trying to 'fight it' and preventing that from happening. So if you want to get sick, you can stop having a virus in your body. If you don't want to, then just get the CDC to make a policy against you not going to a game and keep it on until you can get it."
96,54,"The NFL has never been able to impose rules in the medical field, and every single organization in the US has ever been allowed to enforce these rules."
96,55,Vaccination is essential to stopping the spread of a virus.
96,66,"I don't understand why a CDC commentator called them ""assholes."" I don't understand why the FDA would recommend a mask or a helmet."
96,68,Vaccination is not required. It's not needed for everyone unless the person is in an advanced stage of a clinical trial.
96,83,I just realized that I don't want to be on a team where I can't wear a mask.
96,84,Vaccination is NOT required for everybody unless the person is in an advanced stage of a clinical trial.
96,91,Is there a link to this article? This is not a legitimate question.

101,96,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
96,6,I'm not sure why you're getting downvoted. The government is the main source of this nonsense.
96,8,The only place in the nation that requires a helmet is in America.
96,11,"I don't think they have any kind of mandate, nor do they have a single rule which requires the players to wear a mask. I just think that they are getting a little too busy with their job because, ""It is a horrible practice. I need to be taught how to do it, and to use proper techniques."""
96,21,"I don't know the CDC, but I'd be interested in learning more about the health issues that have occurred since they were created and the way the NFL has treated the problem."
96,37,"As a former NFL player in the NHL, I can honestly say that a doctor would eat a lot of people's head."
96,39,It says the government's inability to enforce this sort of thing is being shown in some ways.
96,45,I want to get some info on this:
96,48,"Vaccination is the primary measure of preventive care, not the retribution of the public."
96,54,I'm a lawyer.
96,55,"I read a really nice article. But the way I read it is it’s like, ‘We don’t need a lawyer’."
96,66,"That's what I mean. The NFL, of course, has a medical department. The helmet would help the defense if they couldn't get it on."
96,68,I don't think it's necessary.
96,83,"Vaccination is essential to stopping the spread of a virus. The government, not the media, is implementing anti-vaccine measures in states where they have mandates to keep people vaccinated."
96,84,"I'm so sorry to say I was never aware that a virus has become so prevalent in the NFL for a while. Honestly, the thing that bothers me about the NHL is the amount of people in the world who don't know about it and can't think of a good reason not to get vaccinated. They're not going to know until after a few years. I mean, in fact, they are going to not know about it for a long while. I'm not sure why anyone would even consider the need to know about it?"
96,91,"They just don't seem to care that much. I mean, there are plenty of reasons that a CDC commentator has called them ""assholes"" and I hate to say it."
96,94,"There is no other way to stop someone from not wearing a helmet, unless it's absolutely required. They are more likely to believe the vaccine isn't actually needed."
100,96,It is almost certainly gonna end with a lot of lawsuits.
101,96,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
96,6,In the NFL there is a medical field that has a helmet and a helmet.
96,8,The only place that requires a helmet is in the U.S.

96,21,"Vaccination is the primary measure of preventive care, not the retribution of the public."
96,37,"In the U.S., when the NHL first started in 1982-83, the NFL would have been doing everything necessary to prevent the spread of a virus. Vaccination is not required for everyone unless the player is in an advanced stage of a clinical trial. Wearing a mask is not essential for stopping the spread of a virus."
96,39,It doesn't make sense at all to say something like this.
96,45,"My favorite comment: ""I'm an advocate for the role of helmet in the protection of health care. I'm a defender."""
96,48,"That's not what I meant, the problem isn't in the head. The question is how much of this is true?"
96,54,"The first thing that comes to my mind when I read this is that the NFL has a medical department. Then I get the question ""Is this just a problem with the helmet? If so, why would it be necessary?"" Which means that there are no guidelines on what, if anything, the players are required to wear. And it doesn't help to get people to wear them. I get it, but not the rule of the NFL."
96,55,"The NHL is a terrible organisation. If the NFL had had a mandate to protect its players from spreading a virus and that was one thing, and the players were already vaccinated, that would be a huge and unnecessary thing to go through, even if they aren't doing it."
96,66,"It's not like the government or anything, it's simply saying the virus is not a virus. It's just that there's a virus in the air that spreads fast and there's no other way to protect yourself."
96,68,I'm in a very similar boat: I'm a retired hockey coach who has been vaccinated.
96,83,"What is the issue? The NFL? Doesn't the government have a mandate - it doesn't require it - that the players wear a mask, but it is required by the health departments to be protected against a serious disease, or does the government enforce it - it's not just a government issue."
96,84,"I have a great experience in the NFL. I've heard of a guy who said ""We need to be taught how to do it, and to use proper techniques."" And I still haven't gotten the CDC's help."
96,91,"It's a cdc complaint, not an actual problem. I mean, the federal government is a pretty major one here, and it's probably a lot worse than it is. But I'm not sure why the NFL isn't taking care of a sick player like I do. I think we need to be aware of the public's perception of the health problems and how it affects us."
96,94,"As a former NFL player, I'm glad to know that there are a few people in the NHL that have got vaccinated. It is very common for a lot of players to never even get to meet with a medical professional because of it."

96,6,I've read that this isn't a good example of why a medical field should have a mask and a helmet. I think it should be something the league can go and do at least a little better in regards to preventing spread of a disease.
96,8,I agree with what your comments and their characterization of the issue are saying.
96,11,"I work in a public health agency and have seen the vaccines being used in the public health department. Vaccinations have been used by a number of organizations as part of the vaccines and health care reform. Despite this, my work has continued because of the ad hoc vaccines that a player can get in. In addition to the other cases it also has been used in the hospital setting to help prevent ad hoc deaths in sick patients in a hospital setting."

96,37,It's not a'mistake' of the NFL. It's not even an issue. It's not a crime or a fact. It's a moral issue. It's the issue of whether the medical professional is needed or not and whether the person who has to put on a mask isn't in the field. It's not a problem in the game.
96,39,It doesn't sound like anyone would consider the NFL to be a terrible organisation.

96,48,"Yes, they should have a proper helmet and helmet, a vaccinated person, a helmet, a helmet, and a mask, a mask, a helmet, and a vaccinated person, but they need the necessary precautions."
96,54,I don't think he's even trying to point out what the wording of this sub is.
96,55,"Yes, I would think that a ""sad"" issue is a ""sad"" issue."
96,66,"I mean, you could have just called me ""assholes"" but that doesn't mean I don't see what the issue is."
96,68,Why the fuck would people in the NFL pay for vaccines?
96,83,"People are able to make a choice between getting sick, not wearing a mask, and not wearing a mask. It's not the same as a choice. It is the best thing you can do. And if you don't get sick, do it."
96,84,"So, the NFL is on the verge of a national sceptic disorder, and a lack of support."
96,91,"""Waving a mask doesn't stop the spread of a virus."""
96,94,Vaccination is a crime in most places. I don't think it's right. It's not even an issue.
100,96,"Vaccination is not required for everyone, unless the person is in an advanced stage of a clinical trial. I can't imagine anyone doing it without a mask at a twitchcon. It's not a big deal to TX."
101,96,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
96,6,"This ain't the 'no,' it's the 'wrong' thing I want to hear."
96,8,"""Why is this not a problem?"
96,11,"You might also like the one I used to play for the broncos, who are probably trying to make it on the field and a helmet for their players"
96,21,"The league has a good team of experts working on how to prevent the spread of AIDS. I'm curious why the NFL is bringing this up, because as a former NFL player I'm not one to be surprised."
96,37,What did the NFL say? I don't see how it's a problem because it has no legal basis for a crime.
96,39,"It's one thing to be against a helmet when you don't want to wear one, it's another to say it's an issue because it's not a mandatory law and it's not even an issue unless you do."
96,45,I've been in the NFL for 10 years and it was absolutely amazing to see that the huddles of people were everywhere. I was so sick I was crying so hard when I went to a game I couldn't imagine wearing a mask.
96,48,I can tell you that this is what I'm referring to.
96,54,"The question you are being asked is: is wearing a mask a good way to get people to show?"""
96,55,"You've been told that there is a big issue with infield helmets. This is a huge issue with health care. We do have a govt mandate that helps protect us against the spread of disease. I don't think we're going to see that if there's not a mandate, we should not be forced to wear masks."
96,66,"""I'm not a government person or official or anything - but I do understand how your comment is making me feel."
96,68,Vaccination is NOT required for everyone unless the person is in an advanced stage of a clinical trial.
96,83,I just realized that I don't want to be on a team where I can't wear a mask.
96,84,It's also sad that there is such a big lack of respect for the NFL.
96,91,"The article states that the NFL is suing the health care reform movement and that this is a 'problem' and not a ""problem."""
96,94,"I'm a fan of the NFL, and I have a mask on. It does help prevent the spread of the virus."
100,96,It's not a big deal to me. I want to continue doing that.
101,96,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
96,6,The best way to get your team on the schedule is to get your own medical field. It's not necessary and has no legal basis for getting you on the schedule. So you can't really expect a gov't official to tell you otherwise. It's a lot of shit.
96,8,I have no idea where the fuck these people live and I can't think of any reason why they are making any sense.
96,11,This thread has been a pretty boring one. I hate it. The best I can do is naively put the people who are not in clinical trials and not the coaches who are the best at it.
96,21,"We're asking the wrong question - how is the league supposed to be doing without a mask if no one can afford it? I'm sorry, but I don't want to be that weirdo."
96,37,I think it's pretty much a question of if a medical professional would eat or chew on the person's head and if it doesn't have legal basis to be there.
96,39,I'm going to say it:
96,45,Is wearing a mask part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus?
96,48,I'm sorry that this is getting downvoted.
96,54,"""Wearing a mask doesn't stop the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask does, however, stop the spread of the virus."""
96,55,If this is a major issue in healthcare policy the NFL will definitely have a big problem with masks.
96,66,Vaccination is not required for everyone. This is a big issue with health care.
96,68,I was so sick I couldn't even imagine going to a twitchcon where they were playing.
96,83,Vaccination is essential to stopping the spread of a virus. The government is implementing anti-vaccine measures in states where they have mandates to keep people vaccinated.
96,84,I'd be more concerned about what other people think of the NFL.
96,91,It's all gonna be a bit out of line but you're right that this is a big problem for the NFL and that the current system is being overreacted.
96,94,Vaccination is not a crime in most places. It's not even an issue.
100,96,A government regulation of a government event could easily be a major red flag in the eyes of its constituents.
101,96,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
96,6,"The CDC is a pretty big problem because people are not supposed to do all that they are supposed to do, so they are putting a lot of effort in making sure they are getting vaccinated."
96,8,Is it really an issue with the helmet and the fact that there are no mandates to wear a mask? Because I can't imagine.
96,11,"There are some examples of how to use a mask on someone else. I mean, a mask can save them from getting sick if someone is in a clinical trial. You can get one on a team but the team can't afford one. Then they need a lawyer so that they can legally afford to provide for their players. Then the player can get sick if they don't have the insurance and pay the insurance. So they can get a better job."
96,21,Vaccination is a part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.It's not a big deal to me. I want to continue doing that.
96,37,There is no right or wrong to this idea.
96,39,"It's just a bunch of people saying that the only way to get the ""sad"" issue is to make a ""sad"" issue."
96,45,Those people don't have a job and they don't wear masks.
96,48,The best thing to do is naively put the people who are not in clinical trials and not the coaches who are the best at it.
96,54,I'm sure a lot of you don't understand this. The NFL has an interesting history of having incompetent medical professionals.
96,55,[NAME] is the voice of the reluctance to give a shit about a virus that is spreading.
96,66,There's the whole thing. The government is trying to create more regulation of the ACA and it's not happening in every state of California. That isn't going to work.
96,68,"No, they are going to go to a twitchcon with them and they will not get a chance to learn something from the commentators who wrote the post. That's a shit job."
96,83,This is all pretty much a question of if a medical professional would eat or chew on the person's head and if it doesn't have legal basis to be there.
96,84,"""I'm afraid it's time we start talking about the disease and try to prevent it,"""
96,91,That's why I don't have any idea why the NFL is being sued by the health care department.
96,94,It's going to be a big problem for the NFL. It's not going to be a big problem.
100,96,"I don't think you get the ""big deal"" part of the sarcasm because the name you used to describe you sounds like you were from the U.S. government. If a law was passed against this law and the legislature was nixed, I would have been shocked."
101,96,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
96,6,There are a lot of reasons why there isn't a helmet in the NFL.
96,8,What's the matter with the CDC?
96,11,">""Waring a mask doesn't necessarily help in stopping the spread of a virus."
96,21,"""[As an athlete, I have to point out that while we can't help stopping the spread of a virus by just wearing a mask, we can definitely help the government protect against it. I can't stand the idea of a game with the helmet on."","
96,37,Vaccination is not a crime in most places. I'm sure it's not a crime in most places. They are just as inflexible about them as the rest of the country in terms of the law they implement.
96,39,I would be a huge fan if I were on a team that was not a good one.
96,45,"CANNOTANSWER, and NOT HIM'S."
96,48,"A lot of things are just a logical fallacy. Vaccination is the primary measure of preventive care, not the retribution of the public. It's a pretty big problem because it could easily be a major red flag in the eyes of its constituents."
96,54,Vaccination does not stop the spread of a virus. It's useless and I hate it.
96,55,"I'm a lawyer, I'm also an advocate for the role of helmet in the protection of health care."
96,66,The NFL is an interesting history of having incompetent medical professionals.
96,68,Because they're going to need a lawyer to help them make the best decision.
96,83,It's not just one issue but a few issues.
96,84,It's not something that's even remotely on par with the NHL's medical system.
96,91,So why does the state of your state require them to wear a mask? That is not a problem.
96,94,"It's a very serious and difficult issue to tackle. You could always take it from there, but you still have to put on a mask to get out of an awkward position and keep it on if needed. Whether or not your teammates can do that and how you feel about it is a big question. It's a big deal. I don't know."
100,96,"No, that's not what I was trying to make fun of. I am saying that the government, not the media, is implementing anti-vaccine measures in states where they have mandates to keep people vaccinated. It isn't a mandate. It is more than the federal government making it illegal. This has nothing to do with a mask. It isn't a mandate. This has nothing to do with a mask. It isn't a mandate. It isn't a mandate. That being said, I am not an expert on the"
101,96,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
96,6,It's not a big deal to me. You're an idiot.
96,8,"Yes, in the CDC, there is a lot of legislation that says that people can go anywhere without a helmet but the rule is the government can't do any of that if they aren't obligated to do it."
96,11,"Vaccination is a medical device, if you have the money, it will stop the spread of a virus. It doesn't prevent the spread of viruses. And a helmet will prevent them from being in the public health system. And there is a lot of questions about the CDC, AIDS prevention, or the CDC's decision to ban it."
96,21,The article says that the NFL is making the right decision to prevent the spread of AIDS. If it weren't for the CDC and not the league I'm sure they would consider it a legitimate problem. It does not make a lot of sense to consider it an issue.
96,37,Is it possible that your state doesn't require a helmet to vaccinate someone?
96,39,"The CDC is bringing a helmet to the NFL. You can wear a mask and there's a number of reasons for it. ""Why not just change your team's rules?"", ""Why not just change your team's rules?"", ""Why not just change your team's rules?"", ""It's just a bunch of people saying that the only way to get the ""sad"" issue is to make a ""sad"" issue."", ""I don't think it's a big deal."", ""I"
96,45,I've done a bunch of things i've always wished would have done more harm to my body.
96,48,"No, the NFL is a narcissistic bunch."
96,54,"""It doesn't make sense at all that I'll say something like this : I'll not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask"" [(https://twitchcon.com/news/nfl_context_report.htm)](https://twitchcon.com/news/nfl_context_report.htm)](https://twitchcon.com/news/nfl_context_report.htm)."
96,55,I agree with your first sentence that you're going to be an asshole and your second one is a pretty big deal.
96,66,"It's the whole point of a mask, and it will work. Vaccination will help prevent a virus and spread it quickly. But if it's a virus, it's only a problem if it's a virus."
96,68,"Vaccination is not a crime in most places. I'm sure it's not a crime in most places. They are just as inflexible about them as the rest of the country in terms of the law they implement. They are basically asking a problem that needs a solution, and the hospital is figuring out a solution."
96,83,I think the issue with the medical profession is that the mandate is an incompatibility. This isn't a crime but it's a real problem.
96,84,Vaccination is not an anti-vaccination policy. It is a medical policy. It has no bearing on the issue. But they are more than the federal government making it illegal.
96,91,"I'm not sure why a bill or a legal argument should be rejected for ""a problem"" because ""it doesn't sound like a problem and that it needs to be solved."
96,94,This is a bit misleading. This is something I am doing. Is there a reason why the NHL doesn't have a helmet?
100,96,It seems like they are just trying to get people to wear a mask to prevent those who aren't vaccinated to a medically proven cause.
101,96,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
96,6,"What is the point of a helmet? Is there an issue with it, is there some questionable solution? If a team doesn't have it, how would they deal with it?"
96,8,I was in the medical field and I knew a lot of people that had a virus. It was a virus that a lot of people can get infected. I couldn't get sick without a mask. My team has a very strong and highly trained team that has the ability to make sure every person has a vaccine. They are also being sued by the health department for not making a mandatory mask.
96,11,I like how your comments here are in general.
96,21,"This is a big deal to me because you don't know what I'm talking about. I'm arguing with you that the NFL is ineffective in addressing the issue of infield helmets. It makes no sense, you are an asshole."
96,37,I don't think it's a problem unless the medical professional gets sick and the team has a serious problem and they can't vaccinate their players if they don't put on a mask
96,39,"CANNOTANSWER, OH MICHAEL ONE : I'll wear a mask and a helmet is not going to keep me from getting sick or sick. The CDC and the NFL have been a bunch of nutjobs for years and it is ridiculous to know that they wouldn't allow anyone on the field to be on the field without a helmet. But I think you're being a fucking idiot. It isn't a big deal. It's a big deal. The CDC and the MLB are going to have to"
96,45,The NFL is not the source of the virus.
96,48,"Vaccination is a medical device, and you will not get sick from a virus, especially if your body has a virus. If a virus is in your body and it's spread, it will probably kill you. This is why a mask is necessary to prevent the spread of AIDS, and that is a health problem that is only caused by a lack of vaccines."
96,54,"I don't care who has the best answer to this, or what I am doing. I am talking about the CDC, not the NFL, I don't care what the issue is, but I don't care what the issue is. I want to be able to talk to the CDC, I want to see if it can help, and the NHL, but I don't want to talk to the CDC."
96,55,"I feel like the NFL is doing enough with the medical field that they want to stop the spread of an infectious disease, whereas in some places, the medical staff just has to wear a mask and have them in the front of everyone else."
96,66,Vaccination is illegal in most places but no one can wear a helmet to prevent that. They are trying to use it to prevent the spread of the virus. It isn't a crime because you cannot do what it's illegal to do.
96,68,The NHL hasn't gotten the vaccine in the first place.
96,83,"In addition to the previous post you noted, it's still illegal to have a mask - this seems like the best thing you can do for you."
96,84,What's the point of using a mask that prevents spread of a virus? It sounds like someone else is just throwing in their narcissism to help them.
96,91,"The CDC can't take care of a player without a mask - it's not an obvious violation of the federal law. That's not legal. It's illegal - the public doesn't have the right to vaccinate players and the federal government is unable to enforce it. It's not the health care system or anything like that. It's not the health care system, it's the people who are making money, and it's not legal."
96,94,Are you a fan of the NFL?
100,96,TIL: Vaccination is illegal in Texas.
101,96,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
96,6,It's been a few months now.
96,8,Vaccination is illegal in Texas.
96,11,"So, you're going to say the same thing that happened to a guy who had AIDS and he was caught in a medical field without a mask?"
96,21,"There are not many issues here. You can't get a vaccine without a mask. In the NFL, no ill players are required to wear a mask. Is this a big deal?"
96,37,The NFL doesn't like what's being sued over. It's not a crime. The NFL has been trying to do more to prevent that. They haven't tried to make a new uniform of their own that fits their players. There's no reason the NFL is being sued.
96,39,I'd hate to see the NFL play the ball when there's a big issue with an air conditioning mask and I wouldn't go to it without a mask.
96,45,No. I'm more concerned about how it's not the health care system. It doesn't change that I don't feel like a fan of the nfl and I don't want to get sued for this.
96,48,"I'm sorry, but I don't believe the NFL is bad at preventing the spread of a virus and that they should get to get to use it."
96,54,Vaccination isn't the problem.
96,55,"I feel like I've lost my sanity. I don't feel comfortable with my helmet, and I'm comfortable with my life."
96,66,I've played in the NFL and it's not a big deal. The only thing that matters is being aware of the health issues you're asking about.
96,68,Vaccination is an important part of the health care system. A mask is a device that stops the spread of any kind of virus.
96,83,I'm really not too sure what to say here. The health care system in a state with a mandate to keep people vaccinated is so bad that they need to start implementing something new.
96,84,"He's not being a narcissist, he's just pointing out that the NFL has been very poorly funded and has a long history of being a disaster."
96,91,I’m afraid it’s not a big deal to me because I’m just tired and insecure.
96,94,"A player in the NFL would be going home if he had a mask on, he would be doing his best to protect the team. The team wouldn't want to be at his job and his safety would be at risk."
100,96,"I would argue that I am a little over a bit of a critic, and not that the government has been removing this omission entirely. It would be a shame for the government to force people to put the mask on. Vaccination is illegal because it is not a mandate and it isn't legal. There are plenty of reasons for people not being vaccinated, but the government is trying to force them."
101,96,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
96,6,Vaccination is illegal in Texas.
96,8,">I've been looking for a new role in the NFL for the last few years. I know it's not the best but I have heard the same thing about some people."", ""I've seen the guy a few times, and I think it's one of the things that really sucks."
96,11,You know what - when the government is preventing a person from getting a vaccine they can say that the mask is important and the players do not need it and the doctors don't have time or money to get sick because they are so sick that they can't get it or it would not work for them?
96,21,The article said that the NFL is making the right decision to prevent the spread of a virus.
96,37,"Vaccination is not a crime, but the practice of it is one of the most important pieces of safety equipment. The safety equipment is a very important component of the health care system."
96,39,"No! Nobody cares. Everyone cares. The NFL is not a horrible organization. It's a terrible thing to do. I do like football, but that's the way it is."
96,45,Vaccination is an important part of the health care system. A mask is a device that stops the spread of any kind of virus. It's not a mandate and it's not legal.
96,48,>I'm pretty sure that I'm doing my best to protect the team.
96,54,"I'd be super snarky and say ""Waving a mask does not stop the spread of the virus. Wearing a mask does, however, stop the spread of the virus."
96,55,"A lot of people in my family think that the NFL isn't in the ""right"" place to vaccinate their players or in the ""right"" place to let them get vaccines because they aren't very healthy."
96,66,"The medical staff - narcissists - who are attempting to rip a sick person off of the field for playing the game, are not in favor of doing the job they have been doing."
96,68,It's an important part of the health care system. A mask is a device that stops the spread of any kind of virus.
96,83,I think the lack of a mandate is a symptom of the problem.
96,84,Vaccination is a policy that stops the spread of a virus.
96,91,Vaccination is not required for everyone unless the person is in an advanced stage of a clinical trial.
96,94,I had the same ad in one of the sections:
100,96,"I had a friend vaccinate me to get the ""vaccinated for a virus"" at a twitchcon event and he'd go on his own. We got it a few days before the event and he was still on his own and vaccinated. He said it's not like there are other states where this would be legal, and he had to get the vaccine because he didn't want the government to enforce it. He went to his local twitchcon and he had a lot of stuff on his head and "
101,96,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
96,6,"Vaccination is illegal in Texas. There are a lot of other states where it's illegal, but they aren't as many people and have a lot of legal concerns."
96,8,People who have not been vaccinated have never actually been vaccinated. Those people are not vaccinated for a reason.
96,11,"""I want to suck a tad more,"""
96,21,"No, it's not a big deal. I think it's a very big deal."
96,37,"Vaccination is not a crime, but a moral one. Vaccination is not a crime, but it is a moral issue."
96,39,"If you're not aware, a helmet is still legal in Texas because it's not covered by the Health Care Act. So if you want to protect yourself, there's a better way."
96,45,"And yet I continue to say to the guys who suck at the NFL that it is a bad organization because it's bad and ridiculous. They deserve a bad time, even when they do it."
96,48,>The NFL is a narcissistic bunch.
96,54,What makes you think wearing a mask is a good way to get people to show?
96,55,Vaccination is important because it is an essential part of the health care system.
96,66,No wonder a lot of doctors aren't going to put up with it.
96,68,">I think that if you had to wear a mask, you might not be allowed to go to a twitchcon where they were playing."""
96,83,I think it's very interesting to see what people think about the health system. The NFL and the media can make it sound like that's what they want.
96,84,"The NFL is very poorly funded, and they should have a vested interest in getting a healthy person in their team."
96,91,Vaccination is not legal. And the medical staff are not paying for that. They just need to get a professional to put it on and that's not how it works.
96,94,I'm a huge fan of the NHL.
100,96,>I think it's pretty crazy that I'm going to say that
101,96,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."

96,11,"Vaccination is not a crime, but a moral one."
96,21,"Vaccination is a good thing to do. In the NFL, no ill players are required to wear a mask."
96,37,"I've been around the NHL since the 60's and vaccinated all my friends. I love playing on the fucking field, but don't play a game like they do. And even when vaccinated - not even an inch."
96,39,"> Vaccination is not a crime, but it is a moral issue."
96,45,"I think the question is how can the NFL possibly avoid being the source of the problem? What are some of the issues the league does with these kinds of issues, and is it possible that there's a problem of an organisation not having sufficient resources to do it?"
96,48,"I just think the government doesn't have any legal authority to make a vaccine mandatory unless the NFL tries to get it. This could be a very big red flag for them, because of the lack of a proper helmet and the lack of security and a lack of a safety net."
96,54,"The NFL has been banned for 3 years. As of today, it's an all-encompassing problem and is an issue that doesn't happen in other countries."
96,55,"You might think that a hockey player has a problem with a mask but you are right - the NFL has a problem with a mask. That means that they cannot get rid of their medical equipment because it is an infectious disease. That is why they cannot get a helmet. The CDC should be able to mandate a helmet to stop the spread of it, but the NFL needs to make it more complicated and have to decide what to put on a helmet."
96,66,"I'm a physician, and this is not a joke. You're right to be concerned if you're allowed to have your personal health in place, but you aren't being treated by the government. They have the right to decide whether to keep you in the game."
96,68,Is there a reason you were told the issue when you were told that there was a reason you were denied a vaccine?
96,83,I've been trying to talk to the coaches that a lot of the people I've talked to have had a virus infection and they weren't getting a virus. I don't understand what you're talking about.
96,84,"A lot of things that don't have to be asked and ignored are, ""Mom, it's not the same thing as wearing a mask on me or putting it on a guy who wears a mask on his head and vaccinates himself""."
96,91,You're going to have a great night tomorrow.
96,94,"As someone who has played for 15 years and was recently awarded an NFC West championship in 2008, I couldn't believe it.

You might think that a hockey player has a problem with a mask but you are right - the NFL has a problem with a mask. That means that they cannot get rid of their medical equipment because it is an infectious disease. That is why they cannot get a helmet. The CDC should be able to mandate a helmet to stop the spread of the virus."

96,37,"i agree with whoever is suing you, but the CDC is not about to impose any other laws on you in order to get you in a medical field. they are concerned that your team has the right to be vaccinated if it is necessary to prevent the spread of the disease."
96,39,Vaccination is a crime - it is in the definition of an issue. If a helmet is being voluntarily vaccinated you're being a criminal. If they're trying to force a government to enforce a law that's criminal - they're doing a terrible job of making a crime out of it.
96,45,"Vaccination is not a crime in the US, unless it's an appropriate treatment of an infectious disease."

They are trying to put a new and better vaccine on the table."

96,83,"Is this the 'I hate it.', 'I'm sick and need some medicine, but don't 'Are you going to wear a mask'?"
96,84,Vaccination is a crime. It is a crime because nobody can get rid of a virus.

96,94,Vaccination is a crime. It's not a crime. It's a crime because of how the healthcare industry works. They are trying to force the government to enforce those laws.

96,83,"""Vaccination is an essential to stopping the spread of a virus. The government, not the media, is implementing anti-vaccine measures in states where they have mandates to keep people vaccinated."""
96,84,It is illegal to wear a mask on players and then be vaccinated. It is also illegal to do that on a team if you are a sick person. I'm sure you understand what's going on.
96,91,This isn't legal. It's a crime. They don't need to be a criminal.
96,94,"Nope, that's not what I said."
100,96,It's a great idea. I'm going to take a seat for this.
101,96,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
96,6,I'm not a lawyer. I'm a doctor. I'm an NFC football coach. It is legal to not wear a helmet and not have a mask. A health care provider should pay for an ambulance and be able to provide the medical equipment you need to stop the spread of the virus and make it happen for you. This is a crime. The NFL is a terrible organisation. The NFL is not the worst example of a horrible organization. It's not a crime. It's a crime. The CDC is trying to do this.
96,8,A few of the questions here are:
96,11,"Yes, it's illegal, but it's very illegal, and the NFL is allowing it, as the players can't legally wear a mask. That's exactly how the rules of the league are implemented."
96,21,"I'm sorry, but I'm not the one to get this on the team."
96,37,", I'm a medical practitioner and I'm a medical professional.  I'm not a doctor. I'm a medical practitioner."

The NFL is not the source of the problem. The NFL is not doing what they want, and they're trying to force the government to enforce that law."
96,48,"I'd think that the NFL has a problem with the NFL getting rid of the use of a mask, if it's been in the works. The problem isn't with the NFL. It's with the NFL because it is a legitimate health issue and is part of the government."
96,54,Vaccination is a crime. It's a crime because the government has the money to do it.
96,55,"I think it’s better to be on the right side of a politician than a politician. I’m a lawyer, and I’m going to be a lawyer, and I’m going to talk to a lawyer."
96,66,Vaccination is not a crime. It's a crime because it's illegal. But there's no other way to prevent it. The medical field is important because it's a crime. It's a crime because the government is doing the job it's supposed to do.
96,68,I think if the NHL was willing to take on this issue as a whole they would re-enforce the law.
96,83,Vaccination is essential to stopping the spread of a virus. It's an essential part of the system that keeps people vaccinated.
96,84,This is an illegal thing. The NFL has to give players a mandate to get vaccinated. The NFL has to enforce the rules. The rules aren't the same as in the CDC. The CDC isn't responsible for ensuring everyone is on board. They're not responsible for the laws in the NHL.
96,91,It's not a crime. Vaccination is a crime because the government doesn't want to force the government to do it. Vaccination is not a crime because the government doesn't want to do it.
