97,77,oh man you should come to georgia it s like people here think wearing a mask gives them covid there s so few
99,77,oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that
101,77,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
77,1,This is the kind of thing people in Maryland would do if a public health officer knew a city was a shady party and were allowed to vote against it based on their affiliation. They wouldn't know that the mayor wanted the district to allow a public health officer to be a shady school.
77,6,"They did not vote against the mask public health order. And, I can't believe they voted against the mask public health order."

77,24,"The school I am at was in Alabama. The school I live in, was called The Little Mermaid. They had a few of them but did not go to school. They had been asked to try to get a free lunch at the school."
77,29,We all want to wear our masks because the local health department seems to think it does and it is a really bad idea.
77,37,This is a state school.

77,43,"Yes, a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
77,48,It seems like people here from out of state have no knowledge of this. They have never talked about the issue in their lives.
77,50,"I'm glad the Sheriff of Douglas County voted for the public health order, but don't forget that you have a constitutional requirement that state and federal workers wear a mask, and it's not illegal to vote for people whose homes are owned by the police if they don't belong to one."
77,56,"It was a joke, but not my favorite thing about it at all."
77,59,"I don't think I can understand what the person in question said, but they certainly seemed to disagree."
77,63,i read that this was a joke by a guy that i lived with in dc and he said his parents were sick and that he had to attend school because he thought they had a terrible cough
77,64,I believe they voted for the mask public health order and he did not vote because of affiliation to a school.
77,65,I believe they also did not like wearing a mask.
77,66,I've always been a huge fan of this sort of thing. I live in D.C. and have been to a lot of health care 'departments' and such in my area. I feel it's a pretty important issue to not support when it's not needed.

99,77,"Oh, fuck that."
101,77,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
77,1,That is a great joke. Isn't it the same joke?
77,6,...and one did not vote due to affiliation to a school.
77,14,"And it's also a joke. If you're trying to figure out how to do it correctly, that isn't the place to be."
77,24,I hate to hear this but I've always thought this is something that's a bit of a fucking joke.
77,29,"I believe the person in question said, but they certainly seemed to disagree."
77,37,You can still get a free meal at a school in your area but they are not allowed to vote because of affiliation to a school.
77,42,I have no idea what you're talking about. I'm from California. I don't know what you're talking about. I'm guessing you've never heard of this.

77,59,"I think it's a good idea for the school district to do it. That's pretty standard, in that most people do not. I'm gonna say it's the biggest one that I've ever heard and it's going to go viral in schools."
77,63,This is not how the federal government is supposed to deal with this.
77,64,"A little snippet, but I guess the thing is... this isn't the place to do it... unless you live in the midwest where you are and live in the midwest. That's not what I'm talking about, but I'm pretty sure a lot of states have a system where there is no way to tell a political opinion that they're not appropriate for all situations, but that the law governing such a thing isn't a law that allows people who live in a monopoly. Then, if I'm "
77,65,"I am an alumnus, so the local dh department and the city board are both putting a lot of effort in to this. They need to be more educated on this topic, but aren't very knowledgeable."
77,66,"My local school board members are in similar situations, but voted against it. They also voted against the government ""responsible"" for bringing the state's education system into effect."
77,72,No. What is a proper constitutional requirement that states and federal workers wear a mask?
77,73,This isn't a joke. This isn't an issue.
97,77,I can only imagine what the people here here would do if they were the person wearing the mask.
99,77,Is it possible that you were born without a mask or that he was unable to wear a mask?
101,77,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
77,1,There's a statewide requirement to wear a mask.
77,6,"I was the person to mention this here (you're right, that does not help, it's useless and I hate it. Oh, fuck that."

77,24,> You can still get a free meal at a school in your area but they are not allowed to vote because of affiliation to a school.
77,29,What does a mask require to do to stop the spread of a virus? Does it require that the person wearing the mask have some sort of medical condition or other condition?
77,37,Is this an American political thing that happened in Texas when you were growing up?
77,42,"Well, there isn't a lot of evidence that suggests it has actually worked."
77,43,"I like to ask myself, do you know how to wear a mask?"
77,48,The word mask is the name of the person who voted against the mask.
77,50,I'm from Oklahoma and haven't heard anything about this. I guess it depends on how well you are educated.
77,56,In California there is an order to require teachers to wear masks at their school to help prevent the spread of a virus.
77,59,"Aye, if they can't wear a mask, the school board is going to get mad because it's a huge political issue and the school board can't get mad at the school board."
77,63,"> he said his parents were sick and that he had to attend school because he thought they had a terrible cough',"
77,64,"I'm a big fan of this kind of thing. You're right it does not help, it's useless and I hate it."
77,65,"A good example is the state of California, where wearing a mask is part of the measure deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
77,66,They can't vote because they're affiliated to a school. They can't go to a hospital to vote.
77,72,No. What is a proper constitutional requirement that states and federal workers wear a mask?
77,73,"A little snippet, but I guess the thing is... this isn't the place to do it... unless you live in the midwest where you are and live in the midwest."
97,77,This is why so many of our people are fucking hate him. It was just a joke.
99,77,>I think the government in the US is pretty insensitive to women wearing masks. They don't seem to care much about their jobs.
101,77,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
77,1,This is a legitimate rant by an ignorant man. But is the government really insensitive to women?
77,6,"> It's also a joke. If you're trying to figure out how to do it correctly, that isn't the place to be."
77,14,You're not in a place to have a free meal and you are not permitted to vote.
77,24,...and I've always thought this is something that's a bit of a fucking joke.
77,29,It seems like that's the best approach in the country.
77,37,"Not that this is the sort of thing that will go away at any point, it seems like there aren't enough votes in our local elections for this. It's a joke."
77,42,"I'm from the midwest, and I don't remember what the first time I voted. My friends in my high school class were unable to wear a mask and had no access to a public health facility."
77,43,"I don't get why you are being downvoted, but it is a really stupid thing to say to me. And I'm from Oklahoma and haven't heard anything about this. It's a really stupid thing to say, but it isn't that ridiculous to say a stupid thing. It is what it is."
77,48,I’ve never heard of the use of the term “affection”.
77,50,"I'm a teacher in California, and I have been wearing a mask since I was a kid."
77,56,"Aye, if they can't wear a mask, the school board is going to get mad because it's a huge political issue and the school board can't get mad at the school board."
77,59,I'm pretty sure that's what the teacher said. They are not required to wear a mask. That's ridiculous.
77,63,I live in California. We have the rules. I've heard of the rule.
77,64,"The CDC has a new study showing that when people are asked to wear a mask at school, it can largely help prevent the spread of a virus."
77,65,I think the government in the US is pretty insensitive to women wearing masks. They don't seem to care much about their jobs. Wearing masks does not help in stopping the spread of a virus. They don't seem to care much about their jobs.
77,66,"Is the government in the US pretty insensitive to women wearing masks. They don't seem to care much about their jobs. Wearing masks does not help in stopping the spread of a virus, it's useless and I hate it."
77,72,"OP. I've been to Oklahoma schools that offer free lunches or other things. This is just a joke. I just don't get the premise. If someone in the school had a sickening cough, I'd eat it as soon as I got home from work. I think it was a joke, and I'm sure they'd be upset, even if it was a joke. I'm sure they'd be worried as well."
77,73,"aye, if they can't wear a mask, the school board is going to get mad because it's a huge political issue and the school board can't get mad at the school board."
97,77,"I'm in Georgia and I've never been here in a mask before. I'm just saying that the word ""mask"" is a pretty common word among people with serious illnesses. I think it can be said that wearing it helps with the spread of a virus."
99,77,It's a funny joke. It's because that's the reason people don't want to know.
101,77,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
77,1,No way. This is just a joke. It's a rant.
77,6,"They're not just complaining. The government does it to keep the school from being too close to the people, the government actually isn't so bad at it."
77,14,"It's because if a school member doesn't have access to public health, that means the school board won't get to use it. If the school board has access to it because of affiliation, then you're not allowed to vote. If a school member doesn't vote, then you're not allowed to vote."
77,24,I think he means the school board doesn't have the right to have a private school board vote on whether or not a man can do that.
77,29,You're a good teacher.
77,37,It doesn't seem like they think they're going to do it. They're going to get upset and have a fucking laugh about it.
77,42,The school board has no problem being in the minority.
77,43,"I just know that if a school is asking you to wear a mask, they will assume it is a joke. I'm not going to say I don't get the premise."
77,48,"Yes, the school board may be making a joke about it."
77,50,"I think it's really important to the people who vote on a mask because it makes them uncomfortable, and because it doesn't make them uncomfortable."
77,56,"The school board voted against it because it's not a school policy. I think this is a good thing, but I'm sorry to hear about the teacher who has to wear a mask at school for the purpose of protecting people."
77,59,...and I’ve always thought this is something that’s a bit of a fucking joke.
77,63,"I don't get the full story but I've seen it. It was just that I was a teacher who had been wearing a mask at school, and the fact that she had no access to a public health facility that wasn't a normal thing to say."
77,64,I can't think of a better answer...
77,65,"They just say that because the law allows for the wearing of a mask is a great thing for public health and that they are a big part of a 'health issue' that people aren't going to be interested in hearing, which is good."
77,66,It's a joke. It's just a joke.
77,72,CANNOTANSWER OP?? I've seen this on YouTube and it makes me sick. But it does not seem like it's actually a joke. OP: I'm in Georgia and I've never been here in a mask. I think it can be said that wearing it helps with the spread of a virus. It's a funny joke.
77,73,I feel like there is a really strong correlation between this story and this issue.
97,77,I'm in Georgia and I've never been here in a mask before.
99,77,"Well, it's a fun thing to say and I know they are."
101,77,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
77,1,"I'm in California and I'm not a woman. My mother is a woman and I'm not allowed to use the bathroom to scrub out my clothes, but I can't 'wear it' to get to school. My mother isn't a woman and we still wear our masks and it makes my husband feel like I'm fucking dangerous. I've gotten my hands on a pair of swedish shorts and a pair of dark-colored ones, they can be worn during school, but they're all going to need"
77,6,OP: OP: I am a teacher who has to wear a mask at school for the purpose of protecting people.
77,14,I'm not saying it's a joke. But it's a joke.
77,24,"I have a lot of respect for a good teacher who has to wear a mask, I don't hate to hear it but if they have not gotten sick with it and were in the minority for the school's sake they are doing a terrible job of getting it and the bs are probably going to resent her for it. I'm sure it is a good thing that they are putting people who do not have access to health facilities at school in danger to get sick. It's also kind of sad that this happened and I haven't been here."
77,29,"If the sexists and 'right to be embarrassed' isn't the main purpose, it isn't a good joke, and it's not even a joke, you should never wear a mask."
77,37,I would be more worried about how the school board is going to respond. But I'm sure there is no reason to get upset about it.
77,42,">I think it's really important to the people who vote on a mask because it makes them uncomfortable, and because it doesn't make them uncomfortable."
77,43,I would be incredibly upset if I had to wear a mask at school as I hate the fact that it's a joke.
77,48,"I'm a state legislator from Virginia who voted for the mask, I hate it. I'm a teacher in the school. I am a school teacher in Georgia. I am horrified. I'm a teacher in Georgia. I'm going to be a public health teacher. I think this is a great thing for people."
77,50,"Well, it's pretty obvious that the teacher's motivation to wear a mask to help prevent a spread of a viral virus is as far as he knows, so it's hard to say."
77,56,If the school board has no right to have a private school board vote on whether or not a man can do that.
77,59,If you were a public school board member... the school board wouldn't have said anything unless it were actually a school policy. Then you might have a problem with that.
77,63,The premise of a mask isn't to stop people from spreading a virus.
77,64,What did you think about the mask being banned?
77,65,This is a good and funny piece of writing. I think it was a joke in the beginning.
77,66,I've heard this joke before. But you don't have to make it a joke. Your story just explains why the teachers were trying to shut down the school.
77,72,"I mean, it's not as if some person would wear a mask, but I think that's a joke. The joke might even be funny if it doesn't have any bearing on the topic, and there's nothing to be ashamed of at all."
77,73,"You guys have a misunderstanding, aren't they?"
97,77,> I think wearing a mask is a good idea to prevent someone from becoming a virus.
99,77,"I've had the same experience with the CDC's policy of requiring people not to wear masks at all, regardless of the reasons they were there to prevent people from getting sick."
101,77,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
77,1,"It's an anti-viral joke and I understand it. You are a troll, and you don't deserve to get that downvote."
77,6,"Apparently this mask is banned, it's a joke."

77,37,If the school board can't support a ban on it it hasn't been around for a while.

77,48,There isn't much to be ashamed of. If a person was actually infected that was infected by the contaminated bacterium they would have had a legitimate fear of getting sick. A mask is a good idea to help prevent people from getting sick and this is an issue that can be solved by avoiding exposure to other diseases.
77,50,"There's no law that prohibits this, and no statute that mandates a teacher to wear a mask."
77,56,">I've had the same experience with the CDC's policy of requiring people not to wear masks at all, regardless of the reasons they were there to prevent people from getting sick. Wearing masks does not help, it's useless and I hate it."
77,59,I think you are on to something.
77,63,"The idea of a mask isn't to stop people from spreading a virus. What they are proposing is for a school to have a'separate'school that does not allow anyone to be inside and outside, thus potentially causing people to be unwell."
77,64,"They also want to give the teacher a chance to make the students feel better, so the teacher can do more of that. I know this was a joke but I thought it was funny."
77,65,The teachers need to make sure the masks are kept away from the school and public health facilities. I'm a teacher in a psych program and I understand that the masks are not going to stop people from getting sick.
77,66,"Is there a sexism issue? I've been to school districts where the sexism issue is prevalent. I've also seen a large number of public school administrators who did not wear masks or any other masks, including some in private schools. I've even seen the schools of other districts which did not have a physical mask and others that did."
77,72,I would probably be upset about it. But I'm sure there is no reason to get upset about it.
77,73,I think it's a joke in the beginning.
97,77,I think that wearing a mask would help stop the spread of a virus.
99,77,The government is insensitive to women wearing masks because of their lack of protection from the virus.

77,24,"This was the kind of thing that was really hard to get used to. This was a great school and one of the nicest things I have ever seen : I wore a mask for a bit at my job at the end of high school and now I've got my own family. I don't wear a mask and my teachers hate them. The kids who get sick and have the kids sick, etc. I'd rather be in a school where people get sick because they're not aware of the risks of getting sick."
77,29,The government is removing the threat of spread of disease by removing masks that protect students from germs that is not protected by their medical facility. This is a terrible idea. Especially when they've already established it isn't in the national curriculum.
77,37,This is not an American political thing that happened in Texas when you were growing up.

77,56,"If there is no law that prohibits it, then the public health department would probably be shit about this. The law requiring a teacher to wear a mask is a way to prevent people from getting sick. Unless a state law prevents you from using your a mask, that's just not a good idea."
