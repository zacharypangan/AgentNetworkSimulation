    "When a game comes to town and the team has a full head mask and helmets, I don't believe there is an official or a player who wears a mask.",
    "... and the implication is that you should try to put on a mask, or you should get a fucking mask, or a gtfo mask.",
    "I'm not sure you really believe it or have you read the article. But it seems like a big fucking shithole to me that the gov't's mandates to protect people from the spread of a virus are just so ridiculous, I can't even get away from the fact that it's so ridiculous.",
    "If you don't want to go to games, you are obligated to go.",
    "I know you're thinking of people who think the gov't's mandates are ridiculous, but they don't actually say something to stop it from spreading, which they do in a lot of states. I'm not sure what you mean. If you want to reassure me that your team isn't willing to do the right thing, the gov't has the right to tell you that you don't want to go.",
    "Why would the CDC want the medical field to have a helmet at all?",
    "As a medical field employee, I know that some people are not going to take advantage of this, and there are some who do not have access to the basic protections.",
    "I'm not sure why you're getting downvoted. The government is the main source of this nonsense.",
    "In the NFL there is a medical field that has a helmet and a helmet.",
    "I've read that this isn't a good example of why a medical field should have a mask and a helmet. I think it should be something the league can go and do at least a little better in regards to preventing spread of a disease.",
    "Is this on a subreddit where there's no issue with the NFL?",
    "The most glaring one is that if you don't like to have a helmet on, it should stop you from getting sick or putting on your helmet. And then there's no helmet at all, so there are no people who can't wear a mask. That said, it is not the NFL, or the Department of Health, or the CDC, or the league itself, and that isn't why the league needs to put a helmet on. It's a huge deal, and that doesn't change. The problem is the people who are getting sick are",
    "As someone who was a professional athlete and has played for the NFL for 15 years and was recently awarded an NFC West championship in 2008, I couldn't believe it.",
    "It's not the health care department, it's the government that's trying to make the situation worse.",
    "I've heard it said that in the NFL.",
    "Yes, they are a bad idea. The league needs to have the medical field in Texas and the NFL needs to get an update on how they're doing, like they want to do in the future, to prevent this from happening.",
    "No shit. The NFL and the CDC are not the ones to have a proper medical field. The CDC does not need a gov to make sure the game is on the schedule. The CDC is not doing a good job of preventing spread of a virus.",
    "Yes, it does. It's not mandatory to wear a mask or helmet.",
    "I've been with the NFL for 10 years. It's not a big deal, and it's not something I'd wish to do.",
    "This ain't the 'no,' it's the 'wrong' thing I want to hear.",
    "The best way to get your team on the schedule is to get your own medical field. It's not necessary and has no legal basis for getting you on the schedule. So you can't really expect a gov't official to tell you otherwise. It's a lot of shit.",
    "The CDC is a pretty big problem because people are not supposed to do all that they are supposed to do, so they are putting a lot of effort in making sure they are getting vaccinated.",
    "There are a lot of reasons why there isn't a helmet in the NFL.",
    "It's not a big deal to me. You're an idiot.",
    "What is the point of a helmet? Is there an issue with it, is there some questionable solution? If a team doesn't have it, how would they deal with it?",
    "It's been a few months now.",
    "Vaccination is illegal in Texas.",
    "Vaccination is illegal in Texas. There are a lot of other states where it's illegal, but they aren't as many people and have a lot of legal concerns.",
    "I'm gonna give the NFL a break and say the other teams are a shit bunch of fucking nuts.",
    "Vaccination is not a crime, but it is a moral issue.",
    "This is just the worst example of the kind of jerk I'd get if I were in my 20s. I'd wear a mask because I was so sick of the way the team handled it.",
    "You're being serious, but I've been able to put it in context and explain it a little. I think that's how a team needs to make sure that there's something to do. Vaccination is a crime, but it's a moral issue.",
    "As a nfl player, I have a lot of respect for my teammates, and I want to thank them for their leadership. I know their respect is very high, but their ability to stand up for their team and do their job in an environment where they can do their jobs, and their team values them. I have been on an NFC team since 1983 and our team had been one of the best in the league. I would be honored to bring back our masks because I did not understand why they have so many players that aren't a problem.",
    "No, the NFL does not have the authority to make mandatory mandatory mandatory helmets.",
    "\"Most of these people are probably going to get sick because they don't have a right to wear a helmet. I'm sure the CDC has some issues with the CDC. And if I were you, I'd probably be in jail.\"",
    "I'm going to make this a political topic. I'd rather read about some shady and ignorant players getting vaccinated than tell them that it's not a criminal thing.",
    "Vaccination is not a crime, but a moral issue. It is a crime, but a moral issue.",
    "Not a moral issue, but it is a moral issue. I'm not a lawyer, but I don't think it's reasonable to believe the government should do what it can to ensure people don't get sick.",
    "You just described a lot of the things the CDC is proposing:",
    "The fact that you are complaining about the government is just a very big reason. I can't believe you just haven't read the article, or heard the same thing about the NFL.",
    "I like the league. It's one of the few teams that has the ability to make a good use of the medical field in the NFL.",
    "I'm an insurance agent, and have been involved in several studies to make sure that the vaccine is not dangerous in the US. It's a crime, but it's a moral issue. I want to make sure the people that are getting sick don't have to be put on a mask. I don't want people getting sick because they don't have access to the basic protections. I'm going to make sure that the people who are getting sick don't have access to the basic protections.",
    "They are going to have a mandate of their own to make sure the helmets are on the schedule. They can't mandate the helmets, and they have no way of knowing what's on.",
    "The NFL has a 'good' job, not a bad job. The NFL is a horrible organisation.",
    "Why are these people not getting vaccinated? Are they not getting the vaccine? Are the players still getting the vaccine? Why not just go to the hospital to get it for the kids who have no one to take care of their kids?",
    "\"I love coaches however if one official or admin address me about our players not wearing a mask or wearing it properly under a helmet i will resign and not coach until this nonsense stops.\"",
    "Why isn't a helmet a crime?",
    "Vaccination is illegal and it is a crime.",
    "When the CDC was created to try and implement mandatory mandatory vaccination, they said there was no issue with it. Isn't it part of the rules that the CDC and the NFL agree on?",
    "I'm not a lawyer. I'm a doctor. I'm an NFC football coach. It is legal to not wear a helmet and not have a mask. A health care provider should pay for an ambulance and be able to provide the medical equipment you need to stop the spread of the virus and make it happen for you. This is a crime. The NFL is a terrible organisation. The NFL is not the worst example of a horrible organization. It's not a crime. It's a crime. The CDC is trying to do this."
