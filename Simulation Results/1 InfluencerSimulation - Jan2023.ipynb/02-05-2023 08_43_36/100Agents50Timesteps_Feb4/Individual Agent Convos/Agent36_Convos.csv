48,36,i was late but i gotta hand it to he s got me wearing my mask everywhere and my area is spiking hard right now just signed up to get me and the wife a drive up test come saturday
64,36,two tri county health dept board members from douglas county voted against the mask public health order and one did not vote due to affiliation to a school
74,36,i m going to say this about twitchcon and masks you can hate me if the state town doesn t have an mandates you can t get mad that an event doesn t not sure if sd has any mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters i will not go anywhere that requires me to wear a mask
75,36,putting on a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things i ve ever done in my entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things
76,36,yes the newest strain is soooooo contagious just bc they have a mask on their hands pics don t mean they re using it
97,36,oh man you should come to georgia it s like people here think wearing a mask gives them covid there s so few
36,2,"If you are a senile young person in Georgia who is not able to go through the health screenings required to get vaccinated and have it in place with a mask, there is little point in going through an anti-microbial course, except as an early bird in the study, that this may be a good thing."
36,5,I am a big fan of this but in order to prevent transmission I have to have a mask on.
36,6,My favorite thing to do when i see people not wearing a mask is cough as hard as i can right in front of them because the fear in their eyes is always so rewarding
36,8,"It's a pretty good reason to wear a mask. You can actually walk ten feet through a restaurant, and then go get to your table. Definitely more fun."
36,11,I have been bitten by a virus.
36,24,Yeah I was pretty sick in the dentist’s office while the doctor was there :)
36,25,I was just chatting with a bunch of guys I knew who were not wearing a mask. I was also trying to find out if they were actually going to get sick by wearing a mask on them. Then they showed up for the drive-up and I tried to try it on myself and I couldn't get sick.
36,32,"You need to get your head around a lot of people on a medical scale, so you don't need to get a mask around people in front of them, they are in a different situation..."
36,35,i have never really done that. i used to go to the meds when i was a kid and was scared but now i do
48,36,The he didn't just send a test... he just made sure the state was safe... and they did!
64,36,> Two tri county health dept board members from douglas county voted against the mask public health order and one did not vote due to affiliation to a school
74,36,I love twitchcon. There are a few i think would be interesting to meet up in my area to discuss them.
75,36,"If your family is a bunch of dumb and self centered people, it should not be a problem."
76,36,That means he will eventually come down with it when they are out.
97,36,That s not how crazy trump made the United States of America
36,2,I'd be scared too. I think I should not do it. I don't think a mask is a good idea for preventing spread of a virus. I think it is useful to look at a few facts.
36,5,"> In Georgia, a majority of the population would be able to go to the CDC without a mask, so if the government has no mandates then people can go to an anti-microbial course. This is a very bad thing."
36,6,The best part about the article is that the people in your post are not talking about a mask and that's one of the reasons.
36,8,"> It's a pretty good reason to wear a mask. You can actually walk ten feet through a restaurant, and then go get to your table. Definitely more fun. I have been bitten by a virus."
36,11,"I think I can give you a little more information about your post about your story, which should be helpful to other people who may be trying to elucidate."
36,24,"In my defense, my family would never want to be vaccinated by a government agency because their job involves public health and not a public health agency. I would be scared of them as well, as in a place where everyone was allowed to be vaccinated and not have to carry the virus out."
36,25,i'm from a senile state and i've never done that :) i'm going to say this about twitchcon and masks you can hate me if the state town doesn't have an mandates you can't get mad that an event doesn't have any mandates as a senile person with boosters :) I am a big fan of this but in order to prevent transmission I have to have a mask on. You need to get your head around a lot of people on a medical scale 
36,32,"... you're not going to get sick because of a virus. If you want to go to a senile teenager senile, then you have to take a mask on a young guy."
36,35,"It's not about how you look, it's about how you feel. I had my first test after a year of not being able to go to a doctor 'cause of my insecurities'. But now my eyes are so fearful of it that they have to have something to swallow and then to cough."
48,36,I think the better thing to do is to get in the bathroom and turn yourself in.
64,36,I want to make a post stating that it's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
74,36,i hate the idea of wearing masks
75,36,"Aye, it's not that crazy to think that we need an emergency to stop the spread of the virus."
76,36,"I've been on the fence, a lot of people who have had a virus on their hands and they wear a mask because they don't want to do it get sick when they are out. I was able to take a picture of that in a backpack a few days ago. I didn't know there were signs of it, but it seemed like there was a strong reason that it is an issue."
97,36,"A lot of people seem to think the same thing. He was being totally mean to everyone else He did a good job. You're right it does not help, it's useless and I hate it."
36,2,"In that sense it is a pretty good idea to wear a mask. People are allowed to carry the virus out, so if they do not have a mask on they will get infected if they don't."
36,5," (And if you want to go to a senile teenager senile, then you have to take a mask on a young guy. It's not about how you look, it's about how you feel."
36,6,"This is the gist of my post. A mask is not the only thing that may not be on the headline. It is the gist of things that will be on the headline: ""Your father could not 'have' the virus but that it isn't an emergency,"" which is why he should have said that it was a good idea to wear a mask."
36,8,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. > Two tri county health dept board members from douglas county voted against the mask public health order and one did not vote due to affiliation to a school.
36,11,"I feel if you go to a public health event, you don't have a choice but to go."
36,24,> One tri county health dept board member from douglas county voted against the mask public health order and one did not vote due to affiliation to a school I love twitchcon. There are a few i think would be interesting to meet up in my area to discuss them.
36,25,"You're right it does not help, it's useless and I hate it."
36,32,The person with the virus is a man of God. You have to be in the medical field and have the health department help you. The only problem with this is that it is a public health issue.
36,35,I live in Texas. I've had a lot of this happen. I've been on the fence. I've had some crazy experiences that led to being bitten by viruses.
48,36,"[[Sorry, I am out of state], but I have never heard of the president tripping in the U.S."
64,36,"i fucking hate the fact that this is a pretty interesting article. It does not make sense to me to take it literally, as it seems to be in the middle of this thread."
74,36,I don't think any of it is really what people want to do to prevent spreading of a virus. I believe they are making a lot of money by buying vaccines and they are trying to prevent a spread of a virus by making people wear masks.
75,36,"We're talking about a ""shameful"" fbi story of a man wearing a mask to go out and have a cigarette to go with him."
76,36,"If you are a fan of the government, a person can have a problem with a very wide variety of virulent infections. They can be contagious, but if they are, then it is inherently a bad thing to do because they are taking virulent agents as they do in their lives. They should be banned from using the same product on others."
97,36,It's called a mask.
36,2,I think people with a virus are making a lot of money by buying vaccines and putting them on their body. But I would definitely not go out with a man who was already being bitten by a virus. I would probably want to be able to use a mask.
36,5,i am a big fan of this but in order to prevent transmission I have to have a mask on.
36,6,"Well, that's true. The guy who told me it was an emergency to have a mask was the fbi. If you are a fan of the government, they are making a big money by selling vaccines to help people get the vaccine, and if you have a problem with a virus, then you should be able to take it off when you go to the CDC and they will help."
36,8,"What is the reason for the government to do this? The government has done nothing, and they have not done anything to prevent a virus."
36,11,"I don't know why this is being downvoted but in the US I can see people who would be really sick if a mask was removed. You know, when the government is rushing it to stop a public health event that would cause it to spread."
36,24,I'd love to meet up with the president of the United States if the government would have decided against making public health agencies make people wear masks. It's not like a bunch of them are not going to do anything or get the government off the ground.
36,25,I have never heard of the president tripping in the United States.
36,32,You're a fucking shady twitch fan. I've had a lot of crazy experiences that led to being bitten by viruses.
36,35,I would not have a choice but to go.
48,36,I think the best thing to do is to get into the bathroom and turn yourself in.
64,36,I am an active member of the Georgia Republican party who is very concerned with the health of citizens. I feel as though this is a very common opinion on the eve of a presidential term. The only thing I really care about is how it's read.
74,36,"So, I'm gonna say: ""At twitchcon, you're sick of twitchcon and twitchcon."
75,36,A hat is not the only way to stop a virus.
76,36,"Yes, that's what a fake mask is for."
97,36,"r/faddit doesn't mean that you're saying it, but the word ""mask"" is not used in the context of ""fake"" or ""twat."""
36,2,It's not a twitchcon article. It's an article from the CIA
36,5,"They don't need any more of this. They're making a money off vaccines. It's not a bad thing. You can't do anything if you don't have a mask. If the government is running a government, it's only making money because they don't want to."
36,6,"You have not had the opportunity to meet the president, you have not been elected, but you are the president."
36,8,"I read that the article, which includes a lot of op-ed comments, describes people who have been infected by viruses in a range of places in the US. I feel like there has been a lot of discussion about it on here."
36,11,"If you want to take a hat off at a public health event, you should just take it off. It's a great way to take a hat off, but the fact that you have never done it means you're getting it from people who knowingly have been bitten by viruses."
36,24,"So, I'm saying: ""At twitchcon, you're sick of twitchcon and twitchcon. A hat is not the only way to stop a virus. Yes, that's what a fake mask is for."""
36,25,I was just chatting with a bunch of guys I knew who were not wearing a mask. I was also trying to find out if they were actually going to get sick by wearing a mask on them.
36,32,"Is there any reason if you want to believe the government is making money and that it is not actually doing anything to prevent transmission of the virus, then you need to tell the CDC."
36,35,"People like the hats and hats, hats, masks and hats all help the government to prevent a virus spreading."
48,36,"If you don't have the mask, you're at risk for being the recipient of an infection."
64,36,The EPA has a policy that it doesn't abide by in most states. This would be one of the issues on the EPA's agenda.
74,36,Almost as bad as the TWitchcon incident in which everyone in Florida was wearing a mask and a hat.
75,36,"A lot of people, especially the wealthy ones, have made an attempt to bring this into the mainstream, but there are a lot of things they are really tired of."
76,36,This is probably not the case in the US. I was under the impression that you didn't realize the risks. You aren't going to get sick from wearing your mask because you are not vaccinated? And you are getting sick from not being vaccinated? I am afraid of the consequences.
97,36,">I read that a guy dressed as a twat was trying to help people in Georgia. That wasn't the point he was trying to make. I hate when people say things like ""I love you. and ""I hate the fact that he makes you feel safe for you!"" and they're so smug about it."
36,2,I don't really see this as an issue with the federal government - the EPA does not have a policy to prevent people from getting infected.
36,5,"The CDC has a policy of not having people wear hats in public health events to prevent spreading of diseases. It was called ""twitchcon"" which is a twitchcon event."
36,6,It's not a bad thing for a lot of people to be told to get a hat for health reasons. I read the article.
36,8,They are ignoring the possibility that people can get the same kind of symptoms if they are wearing a mask on themselves.
36,11,CANNOTANSWER CANNOTANSWER
36,24,It's kind of a bit of a joke.
36,25,i'm from a senile state and i've never done that :) i'm going to say this about twitchcon and masks you can hate me if the state town doesn't have an mandates you can't get mad that an event doesn't have any mandates as a senile person with boosters.
36,32,This is not the case in the US.
36,35,I'm really excited that he has won the election.
48,36,"It’s not a joke, but it sounds like it’s not the same as a joke."
64,36,"The fact that it's illegal to put on a mask outside is pretty disturbing, and I don't see how this is the first time I have ever heard of people saying this. I don't understand why the EPA has been unable to enforce their mandate as well."
74,36,"Vaccines aren't even legal anymore. They're not going to help with this disease. It's not in the context of the article, it’s the context of a post."
75,36,"A lot of people (especially the wealthy ones) have made an attempt to bring this into the mainstream, but there are a lot of things they are really tired of."
76,36,"""Fake masks aren't allowed to do anything wrong. I'm afraid of the consequences. People are crazy about the government. They don't want to do anything wrong, but they have a right to go where they want."""
97,36,"oh man you should come to Georgia it s like people here think wearing a mask gives them covid there s so few ', 'That s not how crazy trump made the United States of America ', 'A lot of people seem to think the same thing. He was being totally mean to everyone else He did a good job. You're right it does not help, it's useless and I hate it."", ""It's called a mask."", ""It's"
36,2,"I think the difference is that there are more people out there who have a disease than people who aren't vaccinated. I'm just saying, I just want to take it as a piece of advice and leave it on an article."
36,5,That's a good one.
36,6,"I think people who feel scared because of something like TWitchcon are sick. They're really sick and are being attacked. If you're not immune to this, you're probably fucked. You're an idiot."
36,8,"You have a pretty serious, serious problem and this is not the first time we've heard of it. The last time I was in Florida was when we were all wearing masks. So, I'm in Florida. Not sure where a joke would have been made."
36,11,"CANNOTANSWER [[NAME] is a guy who is a huge fan of the US government, as an example. They have a policy of not having people wear hats at public health events, so it's only legal to put on a mask in public health events."
36,24,I'm not the president of the United States of America.
36,25,I'm just a little bit of a racist nut who thinks a mask is the best way to protect you from an infection.
36,32,It’s called a mask.
36,35,"I don't think the problem is that people have no idea what the EPA is doing when they aren't wearing a mask. I think a hat or mask might help reduce the likelihood of getting into an infection. If you don't know the CDC's policy, it's not really the issue here."
48,36,"I think the thing that gets thrown around so often that it's hard to say that it's a joke. In fact, it sounds like it's not the same as a joke. 'It's not a big deal, but it's not the government's job to make this a problem."
64,36,"It's not really that important to be in an environment, it's that it's illegal to use public health care in any manner of way that does not violate any kind of law."
74,36,The CDC is actually working on a strategy to get rid of a large number of people that have not had their entire lives. If they are willing to provide the health benefits they would be more than willing to cover a very large number of their patients with the vaccine.
75,36,"I see no problem with the government making this a big issue, but the problem is that the CDC and NRA have no authority to do what they want."
76,36,"Vaccination is a medical necessity, it entails getting vaccinated."
97,36,"""We wear masks does not help in stopping the spread of a virus.Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."""
36,2,"As long as it is a good thing to have a mask on you, and the people who do it with you, you won't get an infection."
36,5,That's a really cool idea.
36,6,This guy is getting a lot of shit for a joke in this post. He's not making it up.
36,8,I'm the president of the United States of America. I'm just a little bit of a racist nut who thinks a mask is the best way to protect me from an infection.
36,11,"The EPA is trying to protect people against the spread of a virus, and people are coming to their aid in stopping the spread. There is a problem with masks."
36,24,"I believe that the first two sentences are both of ""You and I don't agree that it's a big deal."""
36,25,"I don't think it's illegal for someone who doesn't know what a mask is called, to wear it at an event. Is there anything else I could do?"
36,32,It's not a joke. It's a joke.
36,35,The whole point of the hat is that it's not what you're talking about.
48,36,"I am not saying it's a joke, but I think the best thing to do is to get in the bathroom and turn yourself in."
64,36,"This is like the ""Way to wear a hoodie and fuck the EPA,"" ""Swift-swift hoodie,"" ""Creative vs. Anti-Violent"" ""Face the EPA."""
74,36,"If you are not going to get the flu, the government can't go to TWitchCon and do nothing about it."
75,36,"So, it's not really a big issue?"
76,36,A very common type of infection called a Newton virus that the government is threatening to kill.
97,36,"I've just been reading a bunch of his jokes, and when I read the last sentence I read the whole thing: ""Its a good idea to have a face mask."" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NamNiahNiahNiahNiahNiahNiahNiahNiahNiahNiahNiahNiahNiahNiahNiahNiahNiah"
36,2,"I don't think I'm seeing the big deal with this. I don't see the problem with the government. Despite what the article says, it's a big deal."
36,5,There's a problem with masks. It's not the government's job to keep people vaccinated and the CDC can't do anything about it.
36,6,"I read it and thought, ""Hey man, I'm gonna have to go get some of these. But, as the article said, I don't know that a man can be told to put a hat on and they can't be told that a mask is a good idea,"" when I read it, I thought, ""I'm going to be gonna have to put a mask on. I really don't know what I'm talking about."""
36,8,I am the president of the United States of America. I'm just a little bit of a racist nut who thinks a mask is the best way to protect me from an infection.
36,11,People who don't have a mask or a hat don't even think about it. In the US they do.
36,24,"My mother would always wear her mask to TWitchcon, and I would have a lot of fun wearing it."
36,25,I think the issue is that people who wear masks don't have a legal right to wear one. It is only a joke if they have a right to wear one.
36,32,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.It's not really that important to be in an environment, it's that it's illegal to use public health care in any manner of way that does not violate any kind of law."
36,35,"This is how the news media should have reported the CDC and NRA on a few occasions. There's a whole bunch of rants from this guy, but no one actually said they would do the hat thing because I don't understand what they're talking about. It's not really a joke."
48,36,That's a joke! The joke is a joke.
64,36,"""You are all in that for sex."
74,36,Vaccines aren't legal anymore. They’re not going to help combat the spread.
75,36,"I don't know much about politics, but I have heard that there are people who are saying ""you're not going to be getting infected if you don't know that?"" (https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbysmart) It's a good idea that they are going to try to convince themselves that their political agenda is a problem, but they have no intention of removing them."
76,36,That's why I'm not using it
97,36,I have seen him wearing a mask.
36,2,Vaccines aren't legal anymore. They're not going to help combat the virus.
36,5,A face mask and a hat.
36,6,What's your stance on the whole anti-virus and anti-virus thing?
36,8,They're saying it's not a joke because they don't think it's safe for everyone. It's more of a joke because they don't think it's legal to wear a mask.
36,11,The problem is that people who wear a mask don't have a legal right to wear one. It is only a joke if they have a right to wear one.
36,24,CANNOTANSWER)
36,25,I would have to go see the mayor of NY because my husband has a health insurance policy.
36,32,i read that the only problem is that it is a public health issue.
36,35,I don't like wearing a mask. But I do like wearing a mask in public. I do like to wear one.
48,36,It's not funny and you need to do something about it. You can't tell me why people are against it.
64,36,"'.You are in that for sex. I think you could say that ""the EPA isn't willing to admit that their behavior is wrong or a good thing"". ''"
74,36,You're being funny. I don't believe there's any actual debate on how to stop the spread of the virus. There are plenty of other options.
75,36,"I am not an attorney, but I'm not a politician."
76,36,">I would wear a mask outside or in my car alone, because I don't think it will be the same thing for a while. The point of the article is that the government should keep it on the side of the people, and tell people that they can't be abused or criticized because it is a joke."
97,36,It's called a hat.
36,2,>We are all in that for sex. Vaccines aren't legal anymore. They're not going to help combat the spread.
36,5,"There's a reason we do not have this policy, but the fact that it's only a joke is a good reason."
36,6,So you’re going to tell me this:
36,8,"The point is that the government should keep it on the side of the people, and tell people that they can't be abused or criticized because it is a joke. It's called a hat."
36,11,What a dick.
36,24,"i was at the show once and i remember the guy on the front desk saying that he could see the guy in his face and think ""can you be a doctor and stop doing that?""... ""cannot believe there is a problem with that, it's only a joke because people who wear a mask don't have a legal right to wear one. I think you could say that ""the EPA isn't willing to admit that their behavior is wrong or a good thing""."
36,25,"I was wearing one as a child, and I have no idea what the problem is. But it was a joke. I could not stand that people were not going to use it, so I was so incredibly nervous to try it on myself. It was one of the worst things I've ever done. The EPA was not going to admit that their behavior was wrong, but apparently they should have kept them on the side of the people."
36,32,"I’m not a lawyer, but I understand that wearing a mask isn’t the only way to stop the spread of a virus."
36,35,The hat thing is a great idea - that people shouldn't wear a hat in public - if the person isn't wearing a mask.
48,36,">They have to put on the masks to aid in stopping the spread of a virus, and they're trying to make it a joke."
64,36,"So, do you care what people say?"
74,36,This is an interesting topic and one of my favorite things to discuss with my friends. I think you have a funny perspective :
75,36,What if a guy puts a mask on a passenger on the bus?
76,36,"Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of a virus, it's useless and I hate it."
97,36,"""The only reason that a hat screams racist is because the person is making racist jokes and isn't actually aware of them, and therefore doesn't really care about the joke. It's called a hat."""
36,2,I think this may be the logical response from someone who wants to stop the spread of a virus. Is this an effective strategy to stop the spread of the virus?
36,5,"Basically all this stuff about hats, and all the people who say that they should be wearing masks to prevent spreading of a virus isn't funny."
36,6,What does this post say? Because I do not want to go to a show without a mask.
36,8,"I'm a doctor in medicine, so I'm gonna take this as an example of how racist it is. If you don't believe the EPA is willing to admit that their behavior is wrong, then you're lying."
36,11,[CanNOTANSWER] (https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/posts/flashing-virus-the-hat-posts/discussion-flash-virus-the-hat-post) is a really good example of a problem that should not be ignored.
36,24,"I have a lot to tell you and my friends about this topic. It's like ""why would someone who was sick of TWitchcon have a mask and not a mask"" to me."
36,25,I can't imagine how inhumane this is for you.

75,36,I am a little confused about what the NRA is going to do as far as what it is saying here. But the context is right. There are a lot of people who will do this in public without any hesitation - in the context of a hat joke. I have to agree with you.
