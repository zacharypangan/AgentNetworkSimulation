82,79,if you wear a mask outside or in your car alone your gullible and submissive not traits you want to project
85,79,see this is how crazy trump s made the united states of america if you want order in america president donald j trump must take off his mask and turn himself in oh and every day he doesn t people will die starting tonight i m a man of my word covid
99,79,oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that
79,5,People are getting so mad at the government - it ruins the economy to be in such a position where they can't control their own destiny
79,7,No! I just say you are right! I think you should wear a mask if you want not by force
79,10,"Why does trump have to wear a mask in the face of his hysteria? It could be a very good excuse to get caught, but at the cost of other peoples lives."
79,14,"I wouldn't wear a mask. This will only work if you put on your ear, and you will only get one shot. You will probably want to make the choice."
79,20,"To me, the way that a man does is the opposite of the way a man is to the people he tries to manipulate a lawful entity he believes is unjust. And a man has no right to take back the rights of his people. He has no right to make the rules or to make laws. But the truth is that a man can and should do the right thing."
79,24,"[Trump is not against vacks mandates, he is against his mandates - he has the authority to enforce it with the federal government."
79,29,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
79,33,A mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
79,35,What happened if you wear a mask or get a jab if they want not by force?
79,37,"I just started reading this a few months ago and didn't see a whole lot about it. There are a few things that I like about it, and a few others that I find interesting."
79,41,"IANAL and a few others haven't commented on the 'i don't believe'part of the government mandates. If you voted for the 'I don't believe'part, you are not an expert or a politician."
79,48,That sounds like a bit of a remark from a Republican. I'd rather I just take off my mask and turn myself in.
79,55,ahhhhhh... I don't even know how to be a good person at scavenger hunts..
79,56,"The guy that s talking to the other guy has a joke about wearing a mask to stop a virus from spreading, he's not even going to say it's a big deal and will never get a shot"
79,60,> wearing a mask or get the jab if they want not by force
79,61,Are you a Republican? What are you wearing in the first place?
79,65,"if i want order in america, i have to put the trump mask on and get a jab if it makes me feel better. i m not against vacks mandates. but if i want order in america i can wear a mask or get the jab. i m not against vacks mandates. but if you want to start a fight and the economy is ruined, then this should have a name for it."
79,66,Is there anything wrong with going to the police? Because if you aren't against the law you are not against the police. It's not a police thing.

79,75,trump has an old mask and must turn himself in if he wants to keep it.
82,79,"The mask I wear is a good choice. It can be worn outside your car, where you can 'feel' your breath coming out of your head."
85,79,I do not like the use of masks. I see it as a form of distaste for all that would not be a good idea.
99,79,So they don't want to tell maroon to suck at it. It's just an idea that they're afraid to do.
79,5,You said you didn't want to keep a mask and got the robbery if you did.
79,7,"I just want people to know I'm not a republican and have no right to tell the truth, but if you do, you can turn yourself in to a cop to stop the virus from spreading. I have a helmet, and a hat, and my earpiece is a mask."
79,10,"I don't think he can tell the difference, but if he does, there's nothing wrong with it."
79,14,"OP, you have to realize that the guy who said it is ""a bit of a remark from a Republican. What is your view on the government mandates?"" Is it something to be distasteful at or against?"
79,20,The first part is pretty interesting.
79,24,"I think your comment was a bit misleading, in that they were not in any way hostile. I'm a republican and I'm not sure what that was."
79,29,IANAL and a few others haven't commented on the 'I don't believe'part of the government mandates.
79,33,Is there anything wrong with going to the police? Because if you aren't against the law you are not against the police. It's not a police thing.
79,35,"I'm an American. I know I've been in a lot of comas. I've got a mask and a hat, and I don't wear it. I've worn one. That is, in a jar. A mask. I'm not against it. I wear it. The person who makes it said it's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
79,37,The only reason they are not working with you is because they can't enforce your wishes or policies without your consent.
79,41,IANAL and a few others haven't commented on the 'I don't believe'part of the government mandates.
79,48,"I can't imagine a guy who's on the right at a party like that, even if he tries."
79,55,It's not like there's a real difference. The 'I don't believe' part of the government mandates is not a remark from a Republican politician. I'd rather I just take off my mask and turn myself in. 'ahhhhhh... I don't even know how to be a good person at scavenger hunts.' I would like to learn about the government mandates.
79,56,"I'm a fucking Republican who wears a mask, and they don't believe in it. They have a lot of good ideas."
79,60,"The problem is that this doesn't get better. There's nothing wrong with wearing a mask or a jab. It makes me uncomfortable for someone who doesn't have the courage to do so, or to go to the police."
79,61,"This is basically the same thing that happens to everyone in the US. The masks are good, they prevent the spread of viruses. But you could never have any kind of control over them. You could even wear a mask."
79,65,I have a feeling that a mask or a jab is not going to solve all the problems that were created by the Obama presidency. What's the implication of these types of mandates?
79,66,"> In a few months ago I didn't see a whole lot about it. There are a few things that I like about it, and a few others that I find interesting."
79,73,Is the idea of wearing a mask for the purpose of saving the economy really that simple?
79,75,"> ""What happened if you wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force?"
82,79,I can only imagine how this guy would feel in a mask if she were wearing a mask outside and in her car. I'm in my early 20's and have never had any issues with my skin but I'm sure there are ways to get my teeth cleaned and things like that.
85,79,> Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
99,79,"I'm not sure what I'm talking about, but I think the government in the US is pretty insensitive to women wearing masks. They don't seem to care much about their jobs."
79,5,"ahh, the pricks are stealing my money."
79,7,A government mandate is just another piece of a scheme.
79,10,You can't make a decision with a mask on.
79,14,">I would't wear a mask. This will only work if you put on your ear, and you will only get one shot. You will probably want to make the choice."", 'i think your comment was a bit misleading, in that they were not in any way hostile. I'm a republican and I'm not sure what that was."
79,20,Is it any different from your post on the subject. Is it related to the fact that the OP is against the mandates because they ruin the economy?
79,24,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
79,29,"In the UK, it's a matter of time before government mandates become legal."
79,33,"Why are they bringing up these mandates? I don't think they actually have any bearing on the facts. And what about when they get the jab, you are a politician?"
79,35,"If it weren't for the craziness of the mandates, I'd rather be a woman who wouldn't wear a mask and a hat."
79,37,"I would like to know if I've actually come up with a way to stop this from happening, or if I'm going to give a chance to some of the people on the government's staff in a situation similar to my current."
79,41,"I don't know if that was my idea, but it's a good idea. This was originally proposed by the conservative party, which has a history of being anti-immigrant, anti-ethnic and anti-feminist."
79,48,I believe in the US as a whole they have to wear a mask for an emergency and if I wear a mask I can get a job
79,55,"Are you an anti-government/police individual? The first part is pretty interesting. I think your comment was a bit misleading, in that they were not in any way hostile."
79,56,"In general, I think it's a lot more akin to ""I'm not against the mandates cuz they ruin the economy get people fired and people should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force""."
79,60,The government has created a lot of new problems.
79,61,"I don't think it's a big deal. We are just there to protect the people. We want to do something about it, not just make sure the government isn't using it."
79,65,"It's really a shame that you don't understand what ""Vacks mandates"" are. I mean, they are what the government is all about, and it's not necessarily a bad thing, because they're used as a way to make people feel less uncomfortable. That doesn't make them feel better."
79,66,"The ""I'm not against"" part is misleading and misleading. OP, you have to realize that the guy who said it is ""a bit of a remark from a Republican.

I think your comment was a bit misleading, in that they were not in any way hostile. I'm a republican and I'm not sure what that was. I think your comment was misleading."
79,73,Why do I think people who want to wear masks aren't supposed to be the people who want to wear them.
79,75,The person is a naive Republican.
82,79,"I wear a mask in my car to prevent the spread of viruses. I'm not in a blimp. I've been snoozing for a few years. I was never a bulimic, but I did feel like I had a very special bond with the folks in my car that I used to have when I was a teenager. My mom told me about it in an episode of The Office."
85,79,"No, I didn't say it was a joke. But he's being sarcastic."
99,79,The state has mandates as a vaccinated person with boosters? Because it makes people less prone to contract and vaccinating.
79,5,"OP, your comment was misleading and misleading. Is this a remark or a joke?"
79,7,"This is how you're supposed to use your speech. A mask is a kind of mask. Usually with the purpose of preventing the spread of diseases, but usually for preventing sickness or injury. This is something that you shouldn't be uncomfortable with. I do have a set of hats, and a helmet, but I'm not sure I can wear a mask in a pinch."
79,10,My grandmother wore a mask in her car when she was a kid. She was wearing it to protect the family. I'm not sure why she didn't realize that it was an election issue and I wanted her to get some more information to try to tell me about it.
79,14,> I believe in the US as a whole they have to wear a mask for an emergency and if I wear a mask I can get a job Are you an anti-government/police individual?
79,20,"There are many other things that are anti-government, like the “I wear a mask for an emergency” or the “I want to help someone who wants to know how to go about it” - such as:"
79,24,It sounds like the OP is being sarcastic about why they made the comments.
79,29,"I'm a Democrat who was born in the US but never had a job, and I was only in the US because I stayed home with my parents."
79,33,">I would't wear a mask. This will only work if you put on your ear, and you will only get one shot. You will probably want to make the choice."","
79,35,"There's an issue with that. The government mandates people to wear masks are not mandates to protect people in the sense that it's a way to stop the spread of viruses. They are mandates that are not mandated. There's no reason why people don't want to wear them. And why aren't they going to put in a helmet, a hat, and some other type of protective equipment? That's not why they need a mask, a hat, and masks. So, I think it's not at all because they have"

79,48,My friends and I went out once. Our hm... I'm wearing a mask to protect us from the virus.
79,55,I just don't understand why the 'I'm not against' part of the mandates isn't a remark from a Republican politician. I don't understand why the ''I'm not against'' part isn't a remark from a Republican politician.
79,56,"They are not law, just a way to wring their own hair out."
79,60,CANNOTANSWER OP
79,61,I'm going to say the opposite. I'd be quite surprised if the state could have mandated it without changing it.
79,65,>But if i want order in america i have to put the trump mask on and get a jab if it makes me feel better. i have to put the trump mask on and get the jab.
79,66,I think you're the naive conservative.
79,73,No one needs to have a mask. We need a government mandate to take the job of the people that want to be in a government.
79,75,"The government has created a lot of new problems. I don't think it's a big deal. We are just there to protect the people. We want to do something about it, not just make sure the government isn't using it. The government has created a lot of new problems."
82,79,"I'm assuming that the mask was invented as a way to prevent the spread of a virus? I mean it could easily be found outside of a vehicle, even in your car, which can be found in a car if you are snoozing at night. If you're in the right place, then you can always put a mask in your car, but it can also have a visor."
85,79,I don't understand how the government was using a mask to stop the spread of the virus.
99,79,"As an American, I am interested in how this one's interpretation of sex sex is used, but I am not a big fan of these petty jokes about the government's policies. Its a stupid statement, but it is very silly."
79,5,"The mask is basically a way to stop the spread of viruses. The people are being allowed to wear it, but if you get shot and don't get shot then you need to wear a mask, you should be able to get a job."
79,7,Why do you think it's an important thing to be wearing a mask?
79,10,So how does this work? Obviously the federal government doesn't want to mandate it in the first place because the state can not even regulate it. But that doesn't mean it's not mandated by the federal government.
79,14,"Nope. If the US government mandated anything like this, I wouldn't even care if people would wear them."
79,20,That was pretty interesting. What do you think about the 'The first part is pretty interesting'?
79,24,">They are not law, just a way to wring their own hair out."
79,29,You think they are a waste of time? What's wrong with the way the US government treats us in a system of government mandates? I just don't think they actually have any effect on our health and safety.
79,33,"The difference isn't that it's not mandatory, but that it's not a mandate to protect people."
79,35,"A man can't be snoozing in a car, but a hoodie can. And if it was a hoodie, he'd have to keep it."
79,37,"I was raised in the US by immigrants, who were treated very differently to other types of treatment by government officials. So it would be ok for me to go out into the country for a while and see some of the people I know here. I am also against the military and it sucks. My husband and I were effected by it for years and I'm not in the United States."
79,41,"No matter how stupid they are, they are just silly."
79,48,Are you a republican or a republican?
79,55,"It's not a remark from a Republican politician, it's a political fact."

82,79,It is not a crime in the US to wear a mask outside of a vehicle. It's a crime.
85,79,"Those are the things that are made by the government, and those masks do have some sort of function."
99,79,I think this is the most basic and relevant answer to this question: How is it affecting you?
79,5,"I don't think they have a purpose, but they are not mandated to protect people."
79,7,You are a fan of a lot of things.
79,10,I've also been in some of these other petty jokes and have had my own thoughts on this.
79,14,"I walked out and stayed home and felt uncomfortable when I told people my sexist view of government is ridiculous. I'm a socialist. I don't believe in the government, but this isn't what I was expecting. It's how the government is treating people in the UK."

79,55,It sounds to me like the government is using a mask to stop the spread of a virus.
79,56,CANNOTANSWER OP
79,60,The issue is that it is not a crime to use a mask.
79,61,"I'm against the government, but I can't imagine being a republican who likes to call them a petty joke."
79,65,The mask is not mandatory - you wear it while you drive; you wear it when you run.
79,66,This is not what I'd do.
79,73,You could make this a legitimate question for me.
79,75,"It doesn't matter how much you like it, what you're against is what you are against, no matter how much you hate it."
82,79,What? Because the government is already in the way to stop spread of a virus.
85,79,The idea of wearing a mask in a public place is a stupid but completely legitimate issue.
99,79,The US government's propaganda against women is just as depressing and disturbing as any other country
79,5,Wearing a mask outside of a vehicle is one of the measures used by the government to stop the spread of a virus.
79,7,"""I don't believe in the government"""
79,10,Do you think the British government wants to stop this nonsense in order to stop an anti-feminist agenda? Is that the same kind of stuff that was taught by the BBC or even from the BBC?

79,29,">I'm a Democrat who was born in the US but never had a job, and I was only in the US because I stayed home with my parents."","
79,33,It's not illegal to wear a mask outside of a vehicle.

79,56,I don't think it's a crime in the US to wear a mask outside of a vehicle. Unless the state has created a policy that allows people to wear a mask outside of a vehicle. This is a serious and extremely important issue to have addressed.
79,60,"""We're not the government's system of mandates, we're the Government's system of mandates"". I read 'I wear a mask outside of a vehicle' and ""I don't think it's a crime to use a mask."""
79,61,"The implication is that the US government is a depraved petty petty, and there are a lot of ways for government to control public policies. This is not the case for everyone in the US. It is a petty joke, but not a criminal one, in my opinion."
79,65,It's a joke to try and make you feel better.
79,66,What about the idea that a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
79,73,It is not a crime.
79,75,The current government is still trying to prevent the spread of the virus and the state is not ok with that.
82,79,smh. that's the simplest and most common way to say a thing afaik.
85,79,"It's a pretty important point to remember that it's not possible to get a vaccine if the people are wearing a mask, and that it's not the government's job to protect the public."
99,79,A government sponsored vaccine that has been used in Africa for nearly 2 generations has also resulted in a lot of deaths.
79,5,"I'm a liberal, so I can't speak for any other side of the subject."
79,7,I figured that a lot of the same thing happened to me when I stayed in the US.
79,10,"If you look at the article: The first part of the article is a lie: This is a system of government mandates that is being run by people who are not citizens. It doesn't apply to the government, but it has been a practice for decades."
79,14,It's actually more important to keep your mouth shut. It's just because a mask is a part of the government's work. The US has very many policies against a virus that are being used in Africa for a long time.
79,20,"I'm not the only one, so I don't find any of it funny."
79,24,"CANNOTANSWER OP: The first part of the article is a lie: This is a system of government mandates that is being run by people who are not citizens. It doesn't apply to the US, but it has been a practice for decades."
79,29,">You think they are a waste of time? What's wrong with the way the US government treats us in a system of government mandates? I just don't think they actually have any effect on our health and safety."""
79,33,"Yes, it's not illegal to wear a mask outside of a vehicle."
79,35,"[I think that's pretty interesting. In addition to the petty jokes, there are many people who are able to find someone who can actually take the moral and moral responsibility of the people to the point where they cannot be taken seriously. I'm not the only one, so I don't find any of it funny."
79,37,Getting a virus isn't a crime unless the state has implemented the mandates.
79,41,"People should not be able to choose to wear a mask. If they can't choose to wear a mask and get a jab, why aren't they able to?"
79,48,"The only thing that can be said as the ""first part"" of the article is that the government is an anti-assassin and the dreads and apathy are all part of it."
79,55,"I think the first part is pretty interesting. In addition to the petty jokes, there are many people who are able to find someone who can actually take the moral and moral responsibility of the people to the point where they cannot be taken seriously."
79,56,I don't think any government government is going to be able to stop the spread of a virus without them? I don't think there's anything wrong with wearing a mask unless you're really stupid.
79,60,"I'm not a lawyer, I'm not a lawyer. I am not a lawyer."
79,61,"I don't think you have a lot of information here. I don't think the idea of wearing a mask outside of a vehicle is inherently illegal, but its legal to wear a mask if it's really necessary to protect yourself."
79,65,This is so true. There is so much petty in and of itself. This is something I just don't get.
79,66,RIP. RIP. RIP. RIP. RIP.
79,73,"You're right about the masks. I don't want a government that's assassinated and numb as the apocalypse, but you can't just say that you're not against them."
79,75,"They were all supposed to be about saving the American people, not protecting the government. If the CDC was going to budge in the government policy, we would have to start a new initiative."
82,79,I don't like the fact that you say it but I think it's more of a jerk-jerk thing that the government has no problem changing their policies.
85,79,"It was a joke. But I said it was stupid, but he was a complete idiot."
99,79,"The joke is not about the vaccine, it's about how the government is helping to stop the spread of a virus."
79,5,What's the real joke? Its a joke.
79,7,>You are a fan of a lot of things.
79,10,I don't get the joke because I haven't read the article. But I'm not saying the government should be able to stop this but that's just how it is.
79,14,I think you're probably the only one who was not a racist.
79,20,I don't get the joke.
79,24,"It's inherently illegal, but its legal to wear a mask if it's really necessary to protect yourself. This is so true."
79,29,"OP, this is an idiotic joke. What about the ones on ""The government"" that do not actually abide by the mandates?"
79,33,"I'm not sure if that's what he meant, but at the end of the article it is. I don't get the whole ""the government is an anti-assassin"" thing either. Is that what the article is about?"
79,35,"I'm not a lawyer. I don't know the difference between a good joke and a bad one, but I think that's pretty funny."
79,37,"I think you're correct that the idea of using a mask outside of a vehicle is illegal, but the idea of using it inside of a vehicle is not. I'm not sure if it's legal, but it's still legal."
79,41,What I was reading was that if a government mandate didn't apply to the United States then that would not be something that was a crime.
79,48,People can't just say they're against them. They're against government intervention.
79,55,"This seems kind of out of place, and doesn't seem to be in line with how the law changes in the US (as if anything they are putting up with, not just changing it)."
79,56,Then there is the second part of the joke.
79,60,You don't have the right to know what to do about this. You have the right to feel good about yourself. The government has done this with zero evidence. There's a lot of people who are aware of it and don't necessarily agree with it.
79,61,"If there is a good reason to wear a mask outside of a vehicle, why don't you just take a dick or go to court to prove that they don't care?"
79,65,"The government is an anti-assassin. No, the government is not the anti-vaccination type."
79,66,RIP. RIP. RIP.
79,73,"The idea of having a mask outside of a vehicle is not something I would do, because it is very unlikely that someone would actually wear one. That being said, I would try to get people to wear one if they are going to be sick, even if they are only sick, and if they are going to get sick, they should wear one. But that's the whole point of a mask. I don't have a mask, I wear it just to stop the spread of a virus. I could just get sick on the spot."
79,75,Why isn't it legal to wear a mask outside of a vehicle?
82,79,You're making a very important point here:
85,79,It's very well-known that it has been around since it came out and the government was actively trying to stop that. The problem is that it is not possible to get a vaccine without wearing a mask. That's why it's a bad idea. It's a good thing that everyone will be getting the vaccine.
99,79,That is what I believe is a common joke.
79,5,Are you sure that it's true?
79,7,> I think you're probably the only one who was not a racist.
79,10,"Having a mask in a car is not a crime or a felony, it's a crime. If you're going to be an assassin or even a terrorist, the point here is that the government is just not an anti-assassin."
79,14,"[The government](http://www.thefcp.gov/hs/en/htc/en/sp/deployments/hpdcfi) has a video in which the government is infiltrating the government, while allowing the government to ""enact"" a vaccine that has already passed the federal mandate."
79,20,"i agree with you. this is a very interesting point and the best part is the whole idea that they should be doing what was done to help the people who need it. thats very, very funny."
79,24,There's nothing you can do about it.
79,29,It's kind of funny that this is a fucking joke.
79,33,I don't think it's fair to take away some of the truth. I know that some people are actually against the government. The only problem is that people do wear masks outside of their vehicles.
79,35,"I don't think a bad joke would be so fun. The best way to get rid of a joke is to just not make it. It makes it easier for you to see that people are clinging to their racist agenda. And that's a bit of a petty joke, huh?"
79,37,"You have a right to feel good about yourself. The government is a bad idea, the first part of the article is the wrong thing to be talking about. I'm not going to go back to court."
79,41,"I don't think a politician is a good politician, he's a joke, he's a good politician."
79,48,What do you think the government is doing in this case?
79,55,"I am not against a mask, but I want people to wear a mask because that s not the point. I think I'm going to go back and tell you a bit more about why I'm against it."
79,56,A lot of people don't really like the jokes and are not too far off from the fact that they're jokes.
79,60,"People who wear a mask outside of vehicles are very likely to get sick. So, to make it a good joke, you have to wear one."
79,61,"So why does a mask require a license? The government has no responsibility for ensuring the health of the public. OP is a racist, he is not."
79,65,You've already got all the jokes.
79,66,I think it's about the ''Vickings mask '' issue.
79,73,This is an interesting read! That is one of the best books I have ever read. It's a prank I've seen on youtube. The joke is about how this vile and hateful thing is going to keep you sick.
79,75,"OP, here are some good jokes : You don't have the right to know what to do about this. You don't have the right to know what to do about this. You don't have the right to know what to do about this. You don't have the right to know what to do about this. The government is an anti-assassin. The government is not anti-vaccination. The government is an anti-assassin."
82,79,"he's trying to get the government to do something about it that the EPA does not support. the EPA isn't doing anything about it, and they just want to make sure they're doing it to be a crime."
85,79,"It's pretty important to remember that it's not possible to get a vaccine if the people are wearing a mask, and that it's not the government's job to protect the public."
99,79,"I think the problem is that, since the government has never given the medical profession an opportunity to use the health care system to protect the public, it's too easy to get this shit out. The fact that people who have never gotten vaccines are not taking the time to have a look at it is a pretty nitpicky statement."
79,5,"I’m sure you have no idea what that is, but I think that a mask is a good idea. The problem with having a mask in the vehicle is people are clinging to their racist agenda. Those are the very facts that are funny. The problem with the government is that it’s a great way to prevent the spread of the disease."
79,7,"They don't have the right to say this, or to use their wits on you and to do so without your knowledge."
79,10,... and you've been in some of these petty jokes and have had my own thoughts on this.
79,14,">I think the guy who said it is ""a bit of a remark from a Republican. What is your view on the government mandates?"""
79,20,What's the point of doing a health care plan that protects the public?
79,24,It's not a joke. It's a joke. It's the government.
79,29,I'd rather keep the EPA alive. You're not going to get a good joke.
79,33,"The only way to get rid of a joke is to just not make it. It makes it easier for you to see that people are clinging to their racist agenda. And that's a petty joke, huh?"
79,35,No. This is the way to get into the legal world.
79,37,Using a mask for a prank?
79,41,"OP, here are some good jokes : You don't have the right to know what to do about this. You don't have the right to know what to do about this."
79,48,They're making a good point about the apathy of the public.
79,55,"There's no other way of getting rid of a joke, you're just being a racist."
79,56,The only people who are not against wearing a mask are the people who are wearing a mask and not the people who are using the government as a means of prevention.
79,60,This is a good one.
79,61,A lot of people don't really like the jokes.
79,65,I can see a lot of good jokes here but this is how I feel.
79,66,What is the reason for people being sick? You're saying it's about the fact that people are wearing a mask outside of their vehicles.
79,73,> I am not against vacks mandates cuz they ruin the economy get people fired and people should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force.
79,75,"If you ever see a doctor, get the vaccine. It's not your job to get you sick. It's your responsibility to help people who are not at risk of developing an HIV infection. And for you, it's not your job to get you sick."
82,79,If you have no idea why you are getting stung by the government.
85,79,The only way a human being has a right to a healthy lifestyle without a mask is to wear it.
99,79,It's the government's fault for ignoring it. Its the governments fault for ignoring it and putting it in writing as a joke.
79,5,"That's a bit of a shit and a bit of a joke, but its a good one."
79,7,"I haven't actually seen the video and have to reshape the content, unless I've seen some of the above."
79,10,The American public's right to have their right to wear a mask is not a right for anyone unless it is a fucked up joke.
79,14,Are you an anti-government/police individual?
79,20,Are you sure you don't want to see the government making a joke about pranks?
79,24,I am a little confused by the meaning of the whole comment.
79,29,"I have been with people who have no idea why they don't wear masks to get a healthy life, and they still use them, but essentially I can't stand a person ignoring it."
79,33,"I don't get how people like these articles, and I'm surprised they didn't include the ones about the health care act that prevents people from getting sick from their mask. They are all really good jokes, even when they are petty, like I'm trying to tell them I hate them, and I can't take them, I just don't get how they're being funny."
79,35,"Well, not everyone catches the virus. I don't know why that's the case. But I snore in a hoodie and a hat. I don't want to get injured."
79,37,"I think the citation was made in the article, and not written by the OP."
79,41,"I'm a Republican and I think the guy who said it is ""a bit of a remark from a Republican. What is your view on the government mandates?"""
79,48,"You're a bit ignorant of what the definition of a prank is, and it's not something that the media or the news outlets like to use to make fun of people."
79,55,Is that a prank?
79,56,The first part of the joke is :
79,60,It's not a prank.
79,61,I'm not trying to say that they're all racist. I'm trying to say that people with disabilities and HIV are disproportionately in the workforce. I'm not trying to say it's the government's fault for ignoring it.
79,65,I've seen this phrase in the news and it's just so commonplace to have a comment like this.
79,66,"[Hey, I just read your post about the people who aren't against the government mandates. I don't care if you read my entire post. What do you like about them?"
79,73,"People wearing a mask should be able to choose the way they want, not because of the state."
79,75,Those are good jokes about the government. It's an anti-assassin. The government is an anti-vaccination.
82,79,i'm sure you have a lot of issues with your teeth cleaning and things like that. i think it's funny that people think the nahilism of wearing a mask on a highway is part of the skunk problem.
85,79,Well this is my first time seeing an avv on the internet and I just want to tell you how bad it is to know that this isn't the AIDS problem.
99,79,"I don't think this is funny, but it really demonstrates the power of the US government."
79,5,r/narcissists is very good at making jokes.
79,7,I'm a little confused about the meaning of the whole comment.
79,10,I don't even know why the OP's comments didn't include the ones about the health care act that prevents people from getting sick from their mask.
79,14,They're not the government.
79,20,There's a lot of pranks on the internet. It's very clear that there are a lot of things a people don't like about the government a little. It's an anti-government/police thing. Is it funny? Is it funny? Because the government wants to emasculate people who may be disabled and sick if they aren't wearing masks and fucking are wearing them to be safe? Are the government policies to protect them better?
79,24,"[Regime pranks are generally accepted as an anti-savage anti-government prank]. It doesn't matter if it's a joke or not, it's a joke."
79,29,"The prank isn't an idiocy, it is a joke."
79,33,"I think you've already made the first statement (that you're not on r/reddit if you're reading the other comments), but don't seem to be able to explain how you're feeling. I guess you're probably thinking of the phrase ""Assassin,"" which means you're talking about people who don't even like the government, but aren't actually against the government. And it's not just about the government."
79,35,I don't think they're a prank. They're just going to snort the way they want.
79,37,"I can't say for certain whether I am actually on the subject of the government mandates, but I agree with you that some things he's just being ridiculous and you're right that some of the people who are on it are racist. The government does not need any kind of evidence that makes them racist to this day. You seem to be on the side of something he's probably not in the sense you would be a very similar character."
79,41,> I'm sure you have a lot of issues with your teeth cleaning and things like that.
79,48,"I was gonna comment on a joke about how some people are against the government. What does that have to do with the federal government, the skunk problem, the health care act, the government, the CDC and so on. What is the difference between being an assassin and saying the government is an anti-assassin. What is the difference between being anti-government?"
79,55,"If you have a mask that can't be re-applied and is still wearing, you have a lot to worry about."
79,56,"I think it's more about the people who are wearing a mask, that's what everyone else is saying and the one who says it was made in the article"
79,60,"They aren't about pranks, they're about it being an anti-government joke."
79,61,>I think the first part of the joke is : It's not a prank.
79,65,CANNOTANSWER: [http://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/wahri-r-gov/#wahri-r-gov//#wahri-r-gov-r/wahri-r-gov_r_gov-r_ua/r/nyc/wahri-r-gov_ahri_ua.htm?c=#wahri-repoori-i__
79,66,"Yes, the idea of an avv is inherently racist, but as long as you're not an anti-government individual, it's not really a joke."
79,73,I think the way you describe the prank cited the whole point of the jokes:
79,75,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.Are you an anti-government/police individual? Are you sure you don't want to see the government making a joke about pranks?
82,79,"""We're not doing something about it. We're just not doing something about it."""
85,79,It's really ridiculous. It's like a piece of shit. They're using a petty joke as an excuse to ignore the people they are responsible for.
99,79,The most basic and relevant answer to this question.
79,5,"IANAL, but I m fairly certain the joke is about how the government is trying to prevent the spread of a virus. They are not the government. It's an anti-government/police thing."
79,7,A lot of people on this sub are faking the joke.
79,10,"So, the whole idea of a prank that it's a joke is, ""I'm not an assassin. I can't understand your reasoning for this."
79,14,"""No, I think the guy who said it is ""a bit of a remark from a Republican. What is your view on the government mandates?"" ""No, I think the guy who said it is ""a bit of a remark from a Republican. What is your view on the government mandates?"""
79,20,CANNOTANSWER: I think the first part of the joke is : It's not a prank.
79,24,What if your idea was a joke about a system of mandates?
79,29,"I've found that it's actually pretty reasonable that the government has a problem with some people saying they are against government mandates, but this doesn't necessarily mean that they are against government mandates."
79,33,"> ""I know that some people are actually against the government. The only problem is that people do wear a mask outside of their vehicles."", ""It's not illegal to wear a mask outside of a vehicle."", ""Yes, it's not illegal to wear a mask outside of a vehicle."", ""Yes, it's not illegal to wear a mask outside of a vehicle."", ""The only way to get rid of a joke is to just not make it. It makes it easier for you to see that people are against the government."
79,35,It's one thing to say people want to wear masks. The other is to be safe in front of someone who is out of breath. It is not a joke.
79,37,It's not a prank. It's a joke. You're talking about a prank with a joke.
79,41,I believe this is the prank you're trying to make up - it isn't really a joke. It's a joke.
79,48,Is there a difference between being an assassin and being an anti-government?
79,55,"No, it's not a prank. The prank is about being an anti-government prank."
79,56,"I just want to put it that way: people are not being an assassin. They are using the government as a means of prevention to prevent the spread of the virus, and the government is not trying to protect the people they're responsible for."
79,60,No. I have to make a joke.
79,61,> I think the first part of the joke is : It's not a prank.
79,65,"Yes, the idea of an avv is inherently racist, but as long as you're not an anti-government individual, it's not really a joke."
79,66,"It isn't a joke, it's just a joke."
79,73,"Yes, the idea of an avv is inherently racist, but as long as you're not an anti-government individual, it's not really a prank. The joke is about the skunk problem, the health care act, the government, the CDC and so on. The skunk problem is not a joke."
79,75,"I'm sorry but if you're a bit offended by something, a new one might come up. Especially if you're not anti-vaccination or anti-government."
82,79,Is this a satire from a book about the government. Or is it from a movie?
85,79,''The only way a human being has a right to a healthy lifestyle without a mask'''
99,79,"""The only way to get a virus is to be vaccinated so the government can try to help."""
79,5,I can think of a few examples of racist jokes on here.
79,7,I would have thought there was a joke about the skunk problem and I would be more offended if you were an anti-government or anti-vaccination person.
79,10,"I think this is one of those 'honorable people' that will want to be told to ""make a joke"", and not be called an assassin for doing it."
79,14,"[NAME] is one of the best, most influential people in this discussion."
79,20,CANNOTANSWER: I think the first part of the joke is : it's not a prank. What if your idea was a joke about a system of mandates?
79,24,It is a joke. It isn't a joke. It's a prank. It's a joke. It's not a joke.
79,29,"CANNOTANSWER: I think the first part of the joke is : It's not a prank. What about the ones on ""The government"" that do not actually abide by the mandates?"
79,33,The entire point of the joke is to show the lack of actual information that is needed to explain it. It's not really a prank.
79,35,... and then the prank begins
79,37,"""The only way to get a healthy lifestyle without a mask is to be vaccinated so the government can try to help"""
79,41,I think the joke is a bit misleading.
79,48,"I think you're missing the part where it says that the only thing that can be said in the article is that the government is an anti-assassin, not ""An anti-government""."
79,55,It's like they're asking what's going on.
79,56,Is the government a good government? I don't think so.
79,60,"You can be an anti-government skunk, but you have to make a joke that it's against the law."
79,61,I think the joke is a satire about the government.
79,65,"In this case, the whole ""Have you ever seen the white house"" ""Rain in the window, go home"" comment explains how much of the white house is devoted to the idea of “Never be afraid to talk about the white house. The people are just going to get sick and forget about the white house. During the Republican primary, the Republican candidate pressed for a House seat on the budget, which was to the obama administration. During the campaign, the white house made a lot of people who were going to be around the White House and"
79,66,"Why are you still getting downvoted for pointing out that the government is really trying to create a prank about the skunk problem? What if there's a guy who he likes and you don't go to the police, or someone who gets a prank about him that they aren't in their right mind?"
79,73,"No. ""This is an interesting read! That is one of the best books I have ever read. It's a joke."""
79,75,It's actually a prank.
82,79,It is a crime to wear a mask outside a vehicle. It is a crime if they don't have a criminal license.
85,79,They're using the ACA as an excuse to ignore the people they are responsible for.
99,79,People who don't know how to use the internet and use the internet are essentially 'complaining'. So people on this sub would probably have a good point.
79,5,That's what you're saying. What is this.
79,7,"The one in the comments is a sarcastic one, and it's not a prank, and is a bit misleading."
79,10,"It sounds like this guy is a bit of a jerk. You're in this sub, aren't you?"
79,14,It's a prank.
79,20,"Yes, the whole idea that the government is a good government is not a joke."
79,24,"I read an article called ""The Government."""
79,29,"It doesn't seem like it. I was able to come up with a pretty good way to frame this joke based on the fact that it sounds like it's a joke about the government. Then, the question was how did this make any sense?"
79,33,"In your comment, ""I am an anti-government skunk, and I think it's funny because I like it. I would wear a mask outside of a vehicle, but I don't want to take it out of my ear."""
79,35,A prank that doesn't satirize the morality of the government isn't a prank.
79,37,That part seems like a prank.
79,41,"I think there's more to it than the jokes, I think it's just a satire that's not about the government blaming it on people who don't have a health insurance and who don't have a health insurance."
79,48,"This is a funny joke, because you know, what it says. It isn't actually a prank."
79,55,CANNOTANSWER.

82,79,"This is the point the EPA is trying to make, not a law. The EPA is in the right now. It can fire anyone in that position because they don't do something about it. It's a big problem with the government."

79,20,Vaccination is an anti-government joke.
79,24,Vaccination is the illegal thing to do to prevent a virus spreading. People don't like to get vaccinated. People like that and have zero sympathy for the government.
79,29,Vaccination is legal - it's not really a joke. It's a joke. It's not a prank. It's a joke.
79,33,So why doesn't the CDC be against vaccination? Because the CDC is running the country.
79,35,I think we're at a point where it's just a joke. It's more like a joke. It's not a joke. It's just a joke.
79,37,You can't even afford to get vaccinated. And your right to feel good.

79,60,I have nothing to do with this topic.
79,61,You've already said it before.
79,65,"Yes, it is a joke."
79,66,What's your view of the government?
79,73,"Those aren't the jokes. Those are the jokes that are really meant to be funny. The CDC, the CDC, and the CDC are a bunch of pathetic assholes and they want to get rid of any possibility that the government is making fun of a virus and that the CDC is trying to impede their efforts to control it. The CDC is making fun of the government, which is an evil, racist joke."
79,75,"If you don't believe them, you can call it a joke."
82,79,There are very few people who'd like to say that they want to stop the spread of the disease with the EPA.

79,60,The jokes are making fun of people who are not citizens of the United States. There is a reason why that shit is getting aired on news.
79,61,[This is the first time this has been made.](https://en-landlord_historians/academics/2013/01/06/cvc_landlord_historians_for-a_their_self/).

79,48,The word prank is a joke that has a lot of meaning. The idea of a prank is to make fun of things. The actual joke is to make fun of people because it's a joke. The people that aren't telling jokes are cynical and naive. The people who don't know the meaning of a joke don't even care.

79,24,I can tell you that the CDC is using an idea called a joke to make fun of it.
79,29,"What is your point? If the jokes are legitimate, they can be considered pranks and even raped. Then they can be deemed a joke and they will be regarded as a prank."
79,33,"It was written to be a joke, not a joke. It's a joke, and is not a joke. It is a joke because it is a joke. It is not a joke, because it's a joke, because it's a joke. It is a joke because it's a joke."
79,35,CANNOTANSWER:
79,37,Vaccination isn't a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke. The idea is that the CDC is doing something illegal for an actual reason. It is a joke for a purpose.
79,41,I’m not sure I can say what to say but the whole idea of a prank is a joke.
79,48,"I've come to a point where I think ""you know the difference between a joke and a joke, and the idea of a joke has no meaning."""
79,55,It's a joke. There is no law governing the way people can wear a mask in public. It is a joke.
79,56,> I'm going to say the opposite. I'm going to say the opposite.
79,60,"So, ""Poor people who wear a mask outside of a vehicle are very likely to get sick. So, to make it a good joke, you have to wear one."""
79,61,They're not a joke and they're not a joke. They're jokes. The government is a joke because it's a joke. But a joke because the government isn't a joke.
79,65,CANNOTANSWER:
79,66,"I've been here a few years, and sadly, this isn't a normal joke or joke."
79,73,"As a non-American, I cannot even tell you what they are doing."
79,75,People like it when you're offended and apologise if it isn't a joke or if you're not on a team or something. The ACA is a joke that goes beyond the premise of the article.
82,79,CANNOTANSWER: I don't think this is a story about the government. The fact that he's not a lawyer tells me that he doesn't think he should be in court if he wants to sue them.
85,79,The ACA was written by the government in response to a joke from his mother. He was being sarcastic.
99,79,"Vaccination is illegal because it affects the CDC and if people get sick from having sex with an adult, it's illegal."
79,5,"This is a joke. The real joke is that you are being downvoted. You are trying to get a joke but it's a joke. The joke is, essentially, making fun of the people who are in the public eye."
79,7,"CANNOTANSWER: I'm not against vacks mandates cuz they ruin the economy get people fired and people should be able to choose to wear a mask if they want not by force, ""I just want people to know I'm not a republican and have no right to tell the truth, but if you do, you can turn yourself in to a cop to stop the virus from spreading. I have a helmet, and a hat, and my earpiece is a joke."""
79,10,"...and to me it sounds like the whole idea is a joke."""
79,14,"The US has a very large population and this is just one of many cases where the government has abused this situation, and is attempting to fuck a very wealthy, incompetent, evil and misogynistic and racist society."
79,20,"I believe that the joke is the thing that they're allowing to be invaded, so they have to use a sock puppet to protect the public."
79,24,It's a joke if it's a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke and not a joke.
79,29,CANNOTANSWER'S FUN WITH THE CDC?
79,33,Vaccination is a joke because it doesn't affect the CDC or the government.
79,35,People who say they are 'not against a prank' that they just aren't going to take seriously are just going to make fun of the government.
79,37,"This isn't a joke. It is a joke. Those are the ones saying, ""Poor people who wear a mask outside of a vehicle are very likely to get sick. So, to make it a good joke, you have to wear one."""
79,41,I don't see how this would work without the CDC's permission. This is one way to stop a 'prank' that isn't a joke.
79,48,"The first part is probably misleading. The first is a joke, and the second is a joke. The first is a joke. If you are talking about a joke, you should start by putting it on."
79,55,I like it. I think there are many things that are pretty ridiculous about a joke. The CDC is not using the jokes to make fun of it and they are pointing out that a joke makes you better than a joke. They 'd rather make fun of the government' because 'they are making fun of the government' is their point.
79,56,I'm going to say the opposite. I'm going to say the opposite. I'm going to say that it's a joke because it's funny. It's a joke because it's a joke.
79,60,"I'm not a lawyer, but I do care about what people think about the CDC. The CDC is not a joke."
79,61,"The CDC, if it has a mandate, is going to start the CDC's own censorship program."
79,65,"... and I think the government is not a joke, but a prank because the CDC is making fun of it."

79,73,"The government doesn't have the authority to ban things like this, but it's also working to ban what is called ""sex vaccines"" and other things like that, which I don't believe are really racist."
79,75,I think he's having a hard time saying that the US is going to take away all its responsibilities unless it comes to this very topic.
82,79,"I don't think there's a major issue here, but I do believe it's a serious issue."
85,79,'Cannot imagine being able to think of something stupid. I can't imagine being able to think of something stupid.'
99,79,The government has a problem with this joke. It's a joke.
79,5,"There are many jokes about the government, but none are racist. If the government doesn't exist, they aren't allowed to do it. The CDC should."
79,7,"That is pretty much a joke, which is why it's called a prank."

79,14,It's a joke.

79,24,A prank is a joke. A joke is an idea. A joke is a joke is a joke. The CDC is working on a joke because it's a joke.
79,29,"Yes, I think that's a joke."
79,33,"The CDC is a joke, but the people who do the work are making fun of it. It is not a joke. It is a joke because it is a joke. It is a joke because it is a joke."
79,35,"The government's attempting to fuck people, allowing them to be a joke, but that's a joke."
79,37,It's a prank.
79,41,It's a joke because it's a joke. It's a joke because it's not a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke.
79,48,"It sounds like a joke, but not a prank. It makes a lot of sense."
79,55,I think you are the one who needs to go read this. It sucks.
79,56,"A lot of people voted for it, but are not against the mandates. It's a joke, but they're not against the mandates. It's a joke because it's not a joke."
79,60,Vaccination is not a joke. It is a joke. It is not a joke.
79,61,"The CDC isn't a joke. The CDC is just a joke. I'm not sure it is true to what they're saying. But he's being a liar. You don't even need a license to wear a mask, and you can't even afford a facial mask."
79,65,">A lot of r/news and r/cdc aren't exactly the same thing. [In this case, the whole ""Have you ever seen the white house"" ""Rain in the window, go home"" comment explains how much of the White House is devoted to the idea of ""Never be afraid to talk about the white house. The people are just going to get sick and forget about the white house."
79,66,The CDC are trying to ban the skunk problem from my view.
79,73,A joke is a joke. But the CDC is trying to get rid of it.
79,75,A joke isn't a joke. It's a prank because it's a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke.
82,79,"... and it's a crime, it's just one of the big issues - it's a big problem. That's the problem with the federal government, it's also not something that can be abused."
85,79,"It doesn't help that the entire article is sarcastic, which is a lot of other things to look at."
99,79,I just came from the states. This is where a joke comes from.
79,5,"A lot of people get confused by this, but I still feel sorry for you for not explaining how I’m saying this. Wearing a mask outside of a vehicle is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. I’m sure a lot of people get confused by this, but I still feel sorry for you for not explaining how I’m saying this. A prank is a joke. A prank is a joke. A prank is a joke."
79,7,"You seem like a really sarcastic person. Mostly speaking, a prank about the CDC is a prank. Essentially, the CDC is an anti-government, anti-terrorist, anti-vaxxing, anti-infant and anti-government thing. It's a joke because it's a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke."
79,10,Vaccination is ineffective in helping to prevent a disease. It isn't illegal. It's not a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke.
79,14,I'm not a racist. I don't have a right to wear a mask. It's the only way to prevent the spread of a virus and that's what is on here.
79,20,"It's not like the government has any power to stop the spread of viruses, and it's still a joke because the government wants to demonize them. It's just like all of the other things they're talking about that have a power to make it go away. It's a joke because it's a joke."

79,33,It’s all about the joke. Vaccination is a joke because it’s a joke. It’s a joke because it’s a joke. It’s a joke because it’s a joke. The CDC is a joke.
79,35,Because it's a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke. Those are the pranks in the r/h1g1 article.
