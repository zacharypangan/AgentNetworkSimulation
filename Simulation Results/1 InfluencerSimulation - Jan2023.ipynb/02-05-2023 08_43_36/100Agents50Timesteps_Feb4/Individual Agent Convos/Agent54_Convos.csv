I just find that people are fucking awful about the ACA. It's not like people are making a joke, just sexist."
54,46,"This is a good answer. This is the kind of point where I would be annoyed if someone was wearing their helmet to tell the CDC that people have been using fake viruses. This is an actual attempt to change the political climate to allow this people to vote for it, and this is not a fact of reality. This is a stupid question, but an intelligent question about how people are supposed to live their lives. That’s a simple question about the ACA, and that’s a very difficult one for people to answer."
54,53,"Are you a Republican, a Republican, a Republican, a Republican?"
56,54,I have a friend who wears a mask to get vaccines. He is the one I like to wear.
57,54,"It's very obvious from the title that you're referring to a joke: The President has to wear a mask. It's called a joke. Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of a virus, it's useless and I hate it."
75,54,I can't believe that you're being sarcastic.

96,54,I'm sure a lot of you don't understand this. The NFL has an interesting history of having incompetent medical professionals.
54,6,Apparently it's the biggest political problem in America today and it's not surprising at all that the President is going to use it to prevent the spread of health diseases by allowing everyone to be treated equally by government bodies.
54,11,"It's also really silly that people are upset about the ACA because they think it's not a joke. It's just so obvious that the entire AMA is about a joke, and I'm not sure what you're thinking of. This is so obvious that there are people like you that are upset about it. The ACA is something that a lot of people just don't understand and aren't aware of."
54,15,I've gotten to the point where I can tell a little about some of the things that people are joking about.
54,21,"People who go on AMA's in public are saying ""No, no, no! No, no, no, no, no, no!"" They are just trying to change the laws to get people to vote against the ACA because they don't want to. The ACA's AMA is just a joke, and they do not want the ACA to make them look bad, so they're trying to make them look bad. So they get an AMA to show the movie ""The US Government"" (https://www.noaaac.gov/"
54,35,I'm more of a man and a worker.
54,45,AMA. I AMA. It's not a joke.
54,46,"I don't think it is a joke, but a joke. The first time I saw a doctor tell me he had to wear a mask is when I was a kid to prevent the spread of HIV, and the CDC told me it was not a good idea. The second time I got a call from a doctor that the doctors aren't supposed to wear a mask."
54,53,"I don't know if you would understand the title, but I was wondering what kind of a joke that is, i.e., ""I can no longer believe that my friends hate it and want to revert to something I didn't like"""
56,54,"I agree with you on this. You can't make a joke about someone wearing a mask, but it doesn't do the job. This is a good idea for a joke to be that way, because it's going to end up being a joke, and it's a good idea for a joke to be that way. The ACA is about how to stop the spread of a virus, and why do the government should not use the word 'jokes' in the ACA to keep the epidemic from spreading to the end. It's also possible that"
57,54,"> I think that people who are interested in identifying with HIV is an empathetic kid who thinks that the government is doing their job, to prevent the spread of AIDS, are essentially just children in school."

78,54,We are going to need a vaccination and a vaccine.
85,54,"He's trying to force someone to wear a mask, not to save the innocent people who suffer from the disease."
90,54,"AMAs are very important, and can be an unforgivable way of saying things. I have never seen someone get AMA'd on the ACA in public. It sounds like a satire. AMAs aren't very useful, especially since people feel they need a reason to have the public health order, which is to give people their right to say, ""I think this is a good thing"". But I would not agree with the AMA IMO."
95,54,I've been on the subject for several years and it sounds like it's the only thing we ever really have.
96,54,Vaccination does not stop the spread of a virus. It's useless and I hate it.

54,45,"I'd like to point out that if a public politician is in no position to wear a mask in public, he can't be contagious. That's why the government resorted to letting us have the right to wear a mask in the home, not in the car. The gov't resorted to it. That's why we still own a huge majority of our own property and the people who live there aren't allowed to do anything illegal."
54,46,"It's really the best way to handle it - it's inherently cruel, unhelpful, and a good way to tell a story - but if it does not change the topic - I wouldn't be able to read it."
54,53,"A man and a worker, this is very clearly what the ACA is about. You know'sucks the skunk in your car' is a joke, not 'fucking a joke', y'know 'that's not a joke'. You don't need it to stop the spread of AIDS. So don't you agree with it to keep it from spreading?'"
56,54,"I'm not trying to be sarcastic. I'm not trying to say that a new mask would be an improvement over this one, or even a positive."
57,54,The people who have not been treated for HIV are essentially being bullied. And they really think the CDC has the right to treat anyone who hasn't been in a clinical trial.

56,54,"""The ACA is about how to stop the spread of a virus."
57,54,The joke is about a CDC mandate to have the person vaccinated.
75,54,This has become one of the most accepted jokes in American history.
78,54,"I think the government is making jokes in order to distract people. They should have done something like this if they don't want to get into the argument that people should not be in the ACA, because the bill would just not be the best."
85,54,Nope. It was actually a joke.
90,54,"I feel like there is something very, very wrong about the ACA. It seems that it is not a good thing but there is nothing about a good thing as a result of it being implemented."

I want to be able to talk to the CDC, I want to see if it can help, and the NHL, but I don't want to talk to the CDC."
54,6,What does this actually mean to you? I'm a medical school nurse and I was taught that wearing a mask was not necessary. It's like wearing a hat with a black tie in it that will allow you to stop your face from touching the person you are in a public place with a mask in order to prevent it.

They know that people who want to have vaccines in their car do not have to wear masks, they have to wear hats to stop the spread of them, so that isn't an issue."

54,46,I agree with you that wearing a mask is a joke. In fact I think I am quite aware that the ACA is a joke that people want to do so. The fact that people can't wear a mask on a day-to-day basis is an indication that some people are not really aware of the ACA.
54,53,"I don't think this is a joke. This is the one that really gets you off. The question is if you believe that the government is trying to get you off and if the government is doing anything other than ""reduce"" the government?"
