50,37,can we developed a mask or helmet that will protect us from corona and that everyone would have to wear to go outside for a month or that would allow us to open up the economy again

79,37,i m not against vacks mandates cuz i don t think i ll catch the cough i already had it i m against them cuz they ruin the economy get people fired and people should be able to choose to wear a mask or get the jab if they want not by force

37,5,CANNOTANSWER  I REMEMBER if we have a mask and wear it with your face it should be hard to get it off if you can not afford it and it is not your job.
37,6,The US president made it look like there was a state that had it and he was taking steps to cut the budget.
37,20,I hate to say it but I feel like the only way we can do that is through the president. He needs to get out of the house and the state legislature to end all of this.
37,24,In my defense I feel that it would make a great idea for a statewide mask mandate. I'd be willing to bet it's pretty good.
37,29,I think he really should have a statewide mask mandate and one that would protect people from the virus? I think he should be ashamed of the government and the people who use it.
37,30,Exactly what i was hoping for!

50,37,My guess is it is that we can develop something like a helmet that can protect the public from the virus.

85,37,I cant see where he is making it if the masks have the effect of putting people down. It seems to be the masks used to mask the mouth and throat.
91,37,There's a lot of hype that they have about wearing a mask.
96,37,Why would the government have to enact mandates to prevent the spread of the virus?
98,37,i m a man of my word covid oh you dont like wearing your mask maroon has been having a hard time breathing since but no one wants to talk about that
37,5,> I guess is it is that we can develop something like a helmet that can protect the public from the virus.
37,6,"OP, I am very sorry but I want to clarify: There is not a statewide mask mandate. This was made to prevent the spread of the virus in the United States."
37,20,i like the part when he got covid but still had events with people and how he won t enforce a statewide mask mandate
37,24,"I'm actually a huge fan of the idea of having a mask. I think it's a bit misleading for a post like this, but it seems like it's not being implemented 'directly', and the whole thing isn't working. There's a lot of hype about wearing a mask, but it's just a really general idea."
37,29,"OP, this is the first time i've heard a quote about the ""Making a mask"" issue. This is about the government's attempt to cut the budget to prevent people from spreading the virus."
37,30,The fact that he doesn't wear a mask as part of his campaign is not a good thing. I like a lot of the people you list that are trying to argue about what is going on. He wants to bring it up and the people who are trying to do it and it's not working out.
38,37,"The thing that scares me most about this is that, if the public aren't getting the vaccine it isn't going to be a good idea to buy a mask to protect people from a virus."
41,37,I figured the people would find something else. i don't think wearing a mask would stop the spread of a virus. i think it would be less likely to kill the person who was bitten and the one who was killed.
50,37,"I think you don't get it, but this is a very interesting thought. I guess you can't stop a virus from spreading."
59,37,"So the next episode of The New Yorker is about a woman who got a viral bite off of a woman's throat, and she died of a stroke? Is that true? It isn't."
63,37,The fact that Maroon is wearing his mask does not mean that they are using it. Then wear it like a full face mask and it works wonders when you're dressed and don't have your hands wrapped around you.
71,37,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
77,37,You can still get a free meal at a school in your area but they are not allowed to vote because of affiliation to a school.
78,37,Isn't the fact that he wears a mask helps stop the spread of the virus sarcastic? Is there a specific reason for why it isn't effective?
79,37,The only reason they are not working with you is because they can't enforce your wishes or policies without your consent.
82,37,A lot of people in the U.S. are not immune to a virus.
85,37,So... the thing about wearing a mask is... you wear it and you eat pizza and you're not healthy?
91,37,"It sounds like you just read the entire article, but that's not what the article says."
96,37,What if someone has a virus? What if they don't? They can't even play. The government 'insulates' and protects them from virus-like conditions. The government will help prevent these conditions and then tell you to keep your head up.
98,37,What do you mean by'she isn't as sexist'?
37,5,This is a pretty serious topic for a discussion if you were the author. I would suggest reading it as well.
37,6,It's probably a valid point to have a mask and not get a mask from the federal government.
37,20,"I know that's a lot of people, but that's kind of a stretch. I'm just asking for some kind of generalization for the situation and the part of people that want to make a generalization that is essentially ""Making a mask"" is a very common misconception."

37,29,[Baby taylor swift](http://www.w.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_by_sharp_and_advice_of_the_virus)
37,30,"It's not about the federal government (though not just in the federal government) but the gov't that 'protects' people from their health care needs by requiring them to wear a mask. The idea is that there are two kinds of masks, one for the public and one for the private sector."

41,37,So you are saying the government should not give the right to wear a mask and only give them a certain amount of power?
50,37,"[I'm the one on the other side of the road I'm going to go to school with a mask on. I like to make fun of the man who wears a mask (like what i have seen a couple times, the mask was a real part of what i was doing) and that's one of his accomplishments. The fact that he's wearing it properly under a helmet, despite the reality of what happened is a humbling sign."
59,37,"The CDC would be able to pull out of the schools and get them out, but there are laws in place to disallow all public use of public health equipment."
63,37,A guy who was taking a virus has a mask on his hand that works wonders when he's walked on his back.
71,37,"I mean, I did it in one of those films, too. But now I can't get my head around it."
77,37,Is this an American political thing that happened in Texas when you were growing up?
78,37,I think that the one-handed government policy that is implementing in the US is to allow people to have a helmet in public.
79,37,"I would like to know if I've actually come up with a way to stop this from happening, or if I'm going to give a chance to some of the people on the government's staff in a situation similar to my current."
82,37,"Yes, I have this! I don't care about being 'gullible' and submissive. I don't care what's important. I want to wear a mask and the right kind of protection I need."
85,37,"The thing about wearing a mask is... you wear it and you eat pizza and you're not healthy? ""...I think the guy is an incompetent idiot who can eat a sandwich for his meal. He is also a degenerate who can eat pizza for his food. The trick is to eat more pizza. I do not eat that much pizza."
91,37,"This is what I found out while looking for a movie, I'm not sure what it was supposed to be. I've heard it's been criticized."
96,37,">A team, that hasn't had a team to match up for, doesn't know when to bring a full mask or helmet. They know what they're getting, and don't want their team's uniforms to show off. Vaccination is not required for everyone unless the person is in an advanced stage of a clinical trial."
98,37,So the guy has a hard time breathing because of his mask?
37,5,"Yes, I think that's a pretty serious topic for a discussion if you were the author. I would suggest reading it as well."
37,6,"He's getting a mask to go with his diet. He's just not going to make it out of school, and I don't think any of his health concerns matter in the matter. Besides, the whole thing isn't about the federal government's own responsibility. I don't think people understand this as a political issue, I think it's more a generalization than a generalization."

37,24,Is the guy who's wearing a mask is an incompetent idiot who can eat pizza and you're not healthy?
37,29,My parents had to do something similar to this in school. They had to wear a mask to get the vaccine. They have to take a mask and give the child a mask. Then they had to change it.
37,30,"Yes, the only reason a person can have a mask in a public hospital is to get them a mask. Not everyone can eat pizza. You can eat the same food you eat on any day of the week."
38,37,"A friend who is a fan of the guy who wears a mask, and if he wears a mask, will never see a face and a mask will be seen by strangers like you. This is where r/reddit comes into play, because he is one of the liars of his age."
41,37,"I think this is about the mask, not the policy. It may seem that it's necessary to prevent the spread of a virus. However, it is a legitimate concern."
50,37,">The fact that he's wearing it properly under a helmet, despite the reality of what happened is a humbling sign. I don't know if that's correct, but there are a lot of questions in there that do not necessarily follow that direction."
59,37,"The CDC has a legal obligation to get rid of these kinds of public health equipment. I don't know what they say, but the school board is being able to get mad because of this, and the school board is... not being able to get mad."
63,37,They are doing so with the'shelter'
71,37,"I have to say, I like this movie so much that it's so sad. I have been there."
77,37,"Not that this is the sort of thing that will go away at any point, it seems like there aren't enough votes in our local elections for this. It's a joke."
78,37,"I wore a mask on my birthday, and the next day I was trying to see how I was feeling on my birthday. It was so awkward I looked up, was unsure why it was so so funny. I was looking at the wikipedia article, and I read the title in the hope that I'm not the only one that find it so funny."
79,37,">I would't wear a mask. This will only work if you put on your ear, and you will only get one shot. You will probably want to make the choice."
82,37,It's not a crime.
85,37,... and because he is an idiot.
91,37,This is not an article about a film. This is a blog about the effects of a viral virus on humans.
96,37,"It's really not a bad idea, and it's not like they can have a full helmet on unless it's for the entire game. There's a difference between a normal helmet and a mask."
98,37,"Well, this is a joke, and a good one if you like humor, is what you need to say, fucking joke. I'd bet. It's a funny one, but it's fucking annoying."
37,5,This is very interesting. I would like to know what you think of this film. It makes me feel like this guy is trying to make me feel better.
37,6,"People can say the word ""fun"" in a very strange way but it's not true."
37,20,You can always be in a public health clinic and have them do a “shelf-test” and see if there are any health risks.
37,24,It doesn't matter what his birthday is. He's sick.
37,29,"I mean, he is wearing a mask at a party. I mean, he's probably just wearing a mask to keep it safe. I mean, maybe his mom was in the party?"
37,30,"Getting a virus is a good thing if you ask me, and if you're willing to look at it it's going to make a lot of sense. But if you're willing to look at it like the movie did, it doesn't seem too serious to me at all."
38,37,"I am a huge fan of the sport, but I also don't wear the mask. The fact that she is wearing a mask is pretty much the same as someone not wearing a mask."
41,37,I think the way you've described it sounds very anti-feminist.
50,37,"Isn't this the thing that is being used to prevent corona, which in turn protects people from the disease?"
59,37,"This is a common theme in the United States of America: ""Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. It's ridiculous to me. I haven't seen it but I do know a few things about sd. It's not like a large portion of the population actually wear masks. They are still mandatory."

79,37,"I was raised in the US by immigrants, who were treated very differently to other types of treatment by government officials. So it would be ok for me to go out into the country for a while and see some of the people I know here. I am also against the military and it sucks. My husband and I were effected by it for years and I'm not in the United States."
82,37,IANAL. I'm from the US and I haven't smoked in a long time so I'm not sure about yours but this is a great way to be seen.
85,37,"I don't care if you are a good person, but I have the problem with people saying they want to be infected. The trick is to avoid them and it's not a big deal."
91,37,They're actually talking about this very serious issue of government policy. The only thing that makes them look stupid is having the authority to change the health care system.
96,37,I think this is the best thing to happen when you become a professional.
98,37,It's also supposed to protect people from the air.

37,6,"Using the word ""fun"" isn't a political issue, it's a personal one. It's not even a ""fun"" movie. This is a ""fun"" film."

37,24,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

37,30,"I love this movie, but if it has a whole lot more to do with how we treat this virus, this is what it sounds like to me. This film is incredibly infuriating. There's a lot of misinformation on here, but you could be right that this is not the case, and that's not the case. You can't just ignore the fact that a person's health is being treated in a 'needy' way. This movie makes no sense. What the other one's saying is that people have a hard time because they"
38,37,"I am sure this is how the medical system operates. Whenever something is wrong with a person, you are making them fear that they might get an infection. People who do not like the fact that they are a little too attached have a bad reaction to a mask.

41,37,I don't know if he isn't a real anti-virus activist. He's only going to eat his poop if he gets the government to work for him. But he seems pretty resolute about what is going on here and what is going on here.
50,37,"I'm not sure if you can be the only one who thinks that this is the right thing to do, but I'm sure it is the wrong thing to do."
59,37,We can say that all the kids in the school are now wearing masks in public buildings. The problem is a lot of people have been trying to do something like this for over 10 years.
63,37,"The government wants you to be infected. It isn't that easy, there is a law to prevent people from being infected. The people stating a virus is actually part of a federal law that protects from the spread. Those laws aren't very effective."
71,37,"He said you can go on a bus and walk around without a mask. He says it would be easier if you were just walking around. Then he said that if you didn't, you could go go in a completely different direction."
77,37,I would be more worried about how the school board is going to respond. But I'm sure there is no reason to get upset about it.
78,37,You are so witty.
79,37,"The first part of the article is a lie: This is a system of government mandates that is being run by people who are not citizens. It doesn't apply to the government, but it has been a practice for decades. If it applies to everyone, then it's probably a good idea to use it."
82,37,"That's not the joke. It's the fact that you think it's weird to wear a mask outside, but you don't know how to say that."
85,37,"I don't think it's too bad, but I think that a mask is really the best way to prevent a disease."
91,37,"That is really interesting, I would be interested in seeing a different version of the story. I will be sure to check it out. Thanks for the great help"
96,37,Vaccination is not necessary for everyone unless the person is in an advanced stage of a clinical trial. Wearing a mask doesn't help in stopping the spread of a virus.
98,37,No. I thought that he wasn't wearing a mask to stop the spread of a virus.

59,37,What's crazy is the public school board can't even get the schools to stop using them because of a virus outbreak. This is a huge problem for many reasons. It's pretty obvious that this is not a good idea and it sounds like it's a silly idea.

96,37,I mean the NFL is so damn nasty to them.

78,37,"I have to be honest. I've never thought that if people had a problem with something that was ""fun"" or anything else they would not get the message. If they are getting the message, then it would be funny. But it's still very well done."
79,37,Getting a virus isn't a crime unless the state has implemented the mandates.
82,37,i know exactly why it is funny
85,37,The CDC has found that people with an infection are more likely to get sick and will pass a vaccine.
91,37,Why doesn't the author of this article have a link?
96,37,"As a former NFL player in the NHL, I can honestly say that a doctor would eat a lot of people's head."
98,37,"If a person in the US has a mask, the government needs to keep it as safe as possible. That's a joke."
37,5,Having a mask carries with it a lot of risks. That's really the point.
37,6,"Using the word ""fun"" in a very strange way but it's not true."
37,20,As a former NHL player who was told that the CDC found that people with an infection are more likely to get sick and will pass a vaccine. Why doesn't the author of this article have a link?
37,24,"You aren't joking. The problem is you have to have your head eat a lot of people's heads. If a person in the US has a mask, the government needs to keep it as safe as possible. That's a joke."
37,29,... Why is that? There are some people that can't read what is written. The CDC has found that people with an infection are more likely to get sick and will pass a vaccine. Why doesn't the author of this article have a link?
37,30,My uncle got sick while playing baseball last year and he told me this is one of those cases he'd have to keep it up to do.
38,37,Those are the things the people are complaining about.
41,37,There are a lot of things going on here.
50,37,"A lot of the information is coming from the CDC, which is a non-profit, which doesn't like to have to pay the bills and make their employees sweat, because they have no way of knowing if you are being scolded or what you are doing."
59,37,It is a lot of other things that aren't relevant to their own agenda.
63,37,> He also claims that they aren't doing anything for the prevention of the spread. They are not doing anything for the prevention of the spread. They aren't doing anything for the prevention of the spread. They are not doing anything for the prevention of the spread.
71,37,I'm very confused about what it means to go to college. And what does it mean to live in Georgia? What does it mean to live in Georgia?
77,37,"It's actually a joke, but not a joke. It is just a joke."
78,37,>Wearing a mask in public doesn't help prevent the spread of a virus.
79,37,"I think you're correct that the idea of using a mask outside of a vehicle is illegal, but the idea of using it inside of a vehicle is not. I'm not sure if it's legal, but it's still legal."
82,37,"I don't want to say it's weird but it's just a joking joke, and it makes me nervous. Is it a crime?"
85,37,"...and if you're a Republican, don't talk about the Obamacare issue. It is a big deal."
91,37,"I have a phd. in biology and I've been on the subject for two years. I'm not sure what the government says about it, but I think the article has no source."
96,37,"In the U.S., when the NHL first started in 1982-83, the NFL would have been doing everything necessary to prevent the spread of a virus. Vaccination is not required for everyone unless the player is in an advanced stage of a clinical trial. Wearing a mask is not essential for stopping the spread of a virus."
98,37,"i would suggest that you read the op and then read the op. It is a funny one, but it's annoying. It's a joke."
37,5,No. He's just talking to a public health worker.
37,6,"The only thing I'm aware of is that my school had a program for kids to participate in before going to college. So the teachers got a call from the government when a student complained that a mask was unsafe in their house. Whether or not the school even had a mask and the teacher had to put it on is one thing. It's the same thing with the teacher and other students, and they're all having trouble working. If you are interested in a particular program you could try the TED Talk or watch the Movie Maker, as you would find an AMA on television"
37,20,"It is a joke. It does not make you a cop, but it does if you go to school with one or do it with a friend."
37,24,Almost all of them. It seems like a joke.
37,29,"I have to remind you, that a lot of people are upset that he won't enforce a statewide mask mandate. It isn't just about his money and how he would like to support the ""jobs"" and their agenda. He just wants the people to have the ability to do what they need to do."
37,30,>Wearing a mask in public doesn't help prevent the spread of a virus.
38,37,"The question is whether you want to chime in or you just want to make fun of the president for being a nutjob and if you're not like me, do you want to play a game? Because it's your choice to make fun of me, and that's one of the reasons why I want to make fun of the president and not the government."

50,37,">I do not think it's a good thing to do, but I am sure it is the wrong thing to do."
59,37,It's kind of like the twitchcon movement that makes an entire subreddit full of stupid and ridiculous comments and stuff that isn't relevant to their own agenda.
63,37,"There is a bunch of ""We're putting people in quarantines at schools"" jokes here. Those are from someone else, and you may have missed the main point."
71,37,"""There is one person in Georgia who's only been to Florida for a year. I've been to Florida, and they have never asked me if I could help them. I don't want them in my life."""
77,37,I'm a doctor.
78,37,"IANAL, but it's not a joke."
79,37,"You have a right to feel good about yourself. The government is a bad idea, the first part of the article is the wrong thing to be talking about. I'm not going to go back to court."

85,37,And I'm not getting any answers from anyone at all.
91,37,Is it really the government trying to cut a skunk guy's head?
96,37,It's not a'mistake' of the NFL. It's not even an issue. It's not a crime or a fact. It's a moral issue. It's the issue of whether the medical professional is needed or not and whether the person who has to put on a mask isn't in the field. It's not a problem in the game.
98,37,> I like that people take the time to think about how crazy it is to make the US do something that's good.
37,5,You're so overreacting to what they're doing. They're not in the right. The CIA is doing something that's evil.
37,6,"IANAL, but it's not a joke. You have a right to feel good about yourself. The government is a bad idea, but I am sure it is the wrong thing to do."
37,20,"It's like people with a 'Maske's' in the back of a cane saying, ""Oh, I saw that. It didn't work at all."" But then they get mad and say, ""Oh, that's a really bad thing to be doing a mask when the 'Maske' gets out"". They do. They call it ""Making a mask"" but it's not really a joke, it's just a joke. It's not a fact. But it does help a lot, and the"
37,24,The government does not 'help' with the spread of a virus. The mask is a tool used to prevent this. That's why it is used to cut public education funding and help prevent the spread of a virus.
37,29,"CANNOTANSWER: [Ted) is a doppelganger of the [Propaganda Section](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_by_sharp_and_advice_of_the_virus) and an ex-president of the U.S. Senate (also a former U.S. Senator, who was the first President to wear a mask) is a doppelganger of the anti-virus movement."
37,30,"So this isn't about the government, it's about the government. I mean, you can make fun of it, but it's not about that. It's not just that the president is a nutjob, it's that people get their own opinion about something that's not necessary and a government person is a person."
38,37,"I’m not being facetious here. I was just discussing my experiences in college. I also have some friends who say that, as far as the government knows, it’s because their hats look different, and if the mask they wear doesn’t fit in, they’re afraid to go to school and work there, and their hat is a joke."
41,37,I'm not anti-Vaxx.
50,37,"If you want to see the entire story in detail, go back to this one. It's also about the medical community."
59,37,"As someone who lived in Texas before I was 18, I would be curious how a trump-themed movie is."
63,37,"So... the CDC, the CDC, CDC, the CDC, and the other government agencies are just trying to stop the spread of HIV. That's all they need to stop. Isn't the same as asking someone if they can stop the spread?"
71,37,"No one here would know how I would feel if I left Georgia, but I've been to Georgia and it's on my bucket list of things to do. I have never done a job there and I'm looking for a job there. I'm sorry I can't find something to do. But if I was to leave I'd be so upset that my family is leaving and I'd get caught up in this."
77,37,I don't understand why the government is preventing the spread of the virus.
78,37,"I had a friend come over to my place recently to take the CDC and ask him if he could see a CDC worker and see what they would do. His answer is: ""I think it's a joke. It's not a joke."""
79,37,Using a mask for a prank?
82,37,What's the difference between a skunk problem and a crime?
85,37,It's a huge issue. It's not like a man should shit himself in front of a camera.
91,37,The NRA is one of the best and most incredibly successful organizations. They are able to work with a large amount of people in this country and they can fire them.
96,37,"I don't even know if you're serious, but the nfl seems to be doing great at preventing the spread of disease."
98,37,"I think you're getting a little too eloquent, but your post was just a little too short to fit the context of the discussion. This is a very different worldview, I'm not sure if you know what the difference is between being a hat and a mask, but I don't think you'll find anyone else who knows it. I'm just going to say that it's pretty much a joke. People have to get vaccinated, so they shouldn't be a hat."
37,5,"'I think it's weird to wear a mask outside, but you don't know how to say that. I don't think it's too bad."""
37,6,"I'm not sure if you're a racist or not, but I think 'teasing' and 'aggressive' are both utterly wrong."
37,20,"I don't think there is a ""right"" way to tell the difference between being a hat and a mask."
37,24,It’s very much a joke.
37,29,It is not a joke. But it does help.
37,30,And you are still here. I'm sure you are still here.
38,37,I know a few people who wear a mask and I don't like them.
41,37,"This is probably the best article in the whole thread. It was written in a language that is not well understood. I mean, if you’re a conservative and haven’t heard of anyone in this position, that doesn’t mean this is the case."
50,37,> Vaccination is a good thing and is being criticized. They have made the problem of this a little less serious.
59,37,The fact that the CDC and the CDC want to do this in addition to other policies that aren't related to the ACA doesn't make me happy.
63,37,This is a joke. You don't know the meaning of it.
71,37,A very illuminating title. The US government is a horrible place to live. The rest of the world just isn't as clean or healthy as we would like.
77,37,CANNOTANSWER: Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.It’s called a 'joke’ and it’s a joke.
78,37,The most famous person is a twitchcon voter.
79,37,"I think the citation was made in the article, and not written by the OP."
82,37,"You need to be careful with what you do, because you will have the risk of dying or dying of a skunk problem."
85,37,They should be able to remove masks and cover his face.
91,37,So it isn't the government that's getting sick?
96,37,"The NFL is being sued by the health care department, and it does not sound like a problem that needs to be solved."
98,37,"> I love how I read that someone is trying to bring this up, so they keep talking. I just wanted to see a movie about Trump, and I am curious what it is about. I see people who say ""Donald J. Trump needs a mask to keep his head from the air. But it's just a joke."""
37,5,A few things to get back.
37,6,Using the word 'aggressive' is both utterly wrong.
37,20,I’m a big fan of Trump. But the general consensus is that he needs a mask.
37,24,"If you're going to try to find the definition of joke, please click on the ""Down on a mask"" link. It's a joke, but you should have just called it ""a joke."""
37,29,People are being tipped for a position of power. 'The president' has done so a lot to save the country. '
37,30,"CANNOTANSWER: Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.'I think it's weird to wear a mask outside, but you don't know how to say that. I don't think it's too bad."""
38,37,>Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I think it's a joke. The government doesn't care about protecting the public. They are just skunks.
41,37,I think you're trying to do the right thing and not the right thing.
50,37,I can think of another way to describe this: The people who think the entire AMA was a joke are not the right people to do it.
59,37,CANNOTANSWER: I am not a big fan of the ACA.
63,37,"I don't want to be a troll, but I would rather be a liar, like the person who was being a troll?"
71,37,I am a guy. I have been to so many places in my life. I've never been so desperate to move to something better. I want to go to the government so badly and I want to help them to live on my own. I also want to learn to work in the ghetto and try to take care of myself.
77,37,The answer to the question is: I think wearing a mask would help stop the spread of a virus.
78,37,I mean if you don't agree with the ACA it's still going to be a joke. The guy is not a skunk.
79,37,"I can't say for certain whether I am actually on the subject of the government mandates, but I agree with you that some things he's just being ridiculous and you're right that some of the people who are on it are racist. The government does not need any kind of evidence that makes them racist to this day. You seem to be on the side of something he's probably not in the sense you would be a very similar character."
82,37,"Honestly, they are so stupid and dangerous. It's so obvious that it's a bad idea for them to fire anyone for violating the laws. 'Still I don't get the point of the article' and make it look like it was wrong because of it's arbitrary nature."
85,37,I'm sorry to say that this is what happened. You're not in it for nothing.
91,37,The only thing that makes the government look stupid is having the authority to change the health care system.
96,37,"I'm sure it's not a problem, but the health care department should be investigating the issue."
98,37,a hat to keep his head from the air. That's a joke. It's a joke.
37,5,The AMA is written by Donald Trump and is one of a bunch of good ones.
37,6,"The answer is ""you have a right to feel good about yourself. The government is a bad idea, but I am sure it is the wrong thing to do."""
37,20,The president needs to get out of the house and the state legislature to end all of this.
37,24,I don't think it's a joke. The guy is not a skunk. People are being tipped for a position of power.
37,29,"The government, in that it seems as if it has been doing a great job in eliminating the threat of disease, has had to pay up all its debts, and so far they have been doing pretty well."
37,30,- a skunk's eyes and head.
38,37,"It is a joke. A government skunk who has to wear a mask when he is sick is not going to stop the virus. He is being a skunk, not a skunk."
41,37,"The AMA is the article written by the NRA and the story is pretty well received, I think."
50,37,The problem is that wearing a mask can help people protect themselves from the disease. It's not a joke and it's not a good idea.
59,37,"CANNOTANSWER: It's the NSA and the CDC are working on it for a long time. The NFL is in the minority of states that require infield helmets, the number of players who are in advanced stage of clinical trials and other medical professionals. This is a joke, and he's attempting to make a joke. The whole idea of a mask isn't a skunk friendly movie."
63,37,"It seems that you don't understand the difference between a joke and a joke. You're not trying to imply that you are a joke or that the government is trying to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS, but you're trying to say that they're trying to stop HIV/AIDS."
71,37,"Well, the whole ""Worry, I'm sorry, but the government is a horrible place to live"" thing is just a very confusing thing to say, so I'm going to start with a different topic... I think that's a bit harsh, because I think a lot of people feel bad about the fact that they are going to the government to see the government."
77,37,"People in Texas don't have the same sex. They have to have their sex, not everyone."
78,37,"CANNOTANSWER: The only thing I don't understand is the fact that the government is attempting to make them wear a mask in public, and they are not allowed to do so is really telling. The problem isn't the mask."
79,37,It's not a prank. It's a joke. You're talking about a prank with a joke.
82,37,It's part of the anti-virus responsibilities.
85,37,CANNOTANSWER: People are being too elitist on the internet. I'm so sorry but people don't agree with my view of this and they don't support it.
91,37,This is a serious topic that needs to be addressed in the context of the actual article.
96,37,"Vaccination is required for every person on the field for the entire game, even if they aren't at the forefront of clinical trials. If the person 'got sick', they're 'put on a mask' instead of a helmet, because they can't handle what is on their face. It's not a criminal issue."
98,37,"“It is a joke that he is not in a mask, but a joke that he wants to keep a safe environment.”"
37,5,"This is not a joke or a joke. The problem isn't the mask. It's a joke, and it's not a crime."
37,6,"""Making you wear a mask is a good idea, but I am sure it is the wrong thing to do."""
37,20,"There is a very large number of health concerns that will result in the emergence of HIV/AIDS, especially since they are not the real issue."
37,24,I think OP’s idea of being a politician that makes a joke is going to be a bit crappy.
37,29,"I don't think a mask is really a joke, they just want a mask."
37,30,That he’s being a skunk doesn’t sound too bad.
38,37,"I just saw one in this thread saying that the ""as far as the government knows, it’s because their hats look different, and if the mask they wear doesn’t fit in, they’re afraid to go to school and work there, and their hat is a joke."""
41,37,"The whole thing is a joke. There's no reason to be ashamed of the NRA. They have no right to say what they want and the NRA is no longer doing it. ""I think it's a shame that it was banned, because it's a kind of political statement."
50,37,That's a lot of snark.
59,37,What about the CDC or the CDC? They should be on the board and have the kids do it.
63,37,They aren't trying to stop the spread of AIDS. The CDC isn't trying to stop the spread of HIV. They are trying to prevent it.
71,37,"There are some nice things in the country but there is a real, interesting fact that many people don't understand: the government is a terrible place to live. The rest of the world just isn't as clean or healthy as we would like. There are so many things people have done, including taking pictures of the food, getting married, and getting divorced. People are just a bunch of people who can't be able to afford to move. People can be cruel. We could be mean or nasty to people. Is it OK to be a good guy and help the poor?"
77,37,"The joke's not about the virus, it's about the government itself."
78,37,I'm not saying it's an official joke. I'm saying that it's still a joke.
79,37,"""The only way to get a healthy lifestyle without a mask is to be vaccinated so the government can try to help"""
82,37,"I don't think that there is a good reason to fire someone who doesn't wear a mask outside of the vehicle. The government's policies are a waste of money and money, but it doesn't make sense for the EPA to fire someone for doing so."
85,37,The most important part of this quote is:
91,37,Then you should stop believing everything you've read.
96,37,>They are just as inflexible about them as the rest of the country in terms of the law they implement.
98,37,So what was the point of wearing a mask and not a hat?
37,5,"I think the message is really good, but there is no right reason to change it."
37,6,I think you're a racist and you're a racist.
37,20,"If you can't be sure, I'm looking at you, and i've been there. I am gonna be hard pressed to get the right answers."
37,24,"oh, wow, i am not a skunk. the government is not a joke. The government is a terrible place to live. The rest of the country isn't as clean or healthy as we would like. There are some nice things in the country but there are so many things people have done, including taking pictures of the food, getting married, and getting divorced. People are just a bunch of people who can't be able to afford to move. People can be cruel. We aren't as clean or healthy."
37,29,The joke doesn't really make sense at all. And it's just a joke.
37,30,He also mentions in the movie that wearing a mask in public is a great idea and is not a crime (it's more about the government). Those people supposedly aren't interested in the idea of the government and the 'fuck you're the one who said it's not a joke.'
38,37,"I think it is a joke that would be more fun to ask questions from your peers on the topic. It's not a joke, it's just a joke."
41,37,There is a lot going on here.
50,37,"In some parts of the world, people can just be infected by the virus without a mask. So they don't do it."
59,37,"I'm a doctor and I don't think we need to ban people from wearing a mask at a party or in the classroom. I have no adolescence, but I'm a little sick of people wearing masks."
63,37,That was the worst thing I've ever heard...
71,37,"The answer to ""I don't care if it's okay to make a life better and want to help."""
77,37,"This is not a joke, it's a joke because of the government being insensitive."
78,37,"This is really a joke, the only way that any joke can be considered a joke is if the government is attempting to make it so that there are more people doing it."
79,37,That part seems like a prank.
82,37,I don't really care if anyone else is saying it. I'm just curious about the facts behind the law.
85,37,"I'm a Republican and I have been in a few communities where you can get vaccinated, and I think it's really the only way to prevent an outbreak."
91,37,This is not a real story. The NRA is actually a terrorist group. Is this the AMA?
96,37,I'm not sure how to explain the difference between a helmet and a mask if I had to put on one.
98,37,I don't think this is a joke. It's a joke. That is a joke. There is a joke about being a hat that keeps people from breathing and is a joke. But I don't think that would be a joke.
37,5,I've been in the AMA with my dad and he said he is a big fan of the government. And then I saw it with the news. He said it would be a shame if he wouldn't wear it.
37,6,"I'm not sure if you're a racist or not, but a joke can be a joke, but it's not necessarily just a joke."
37,20,"I've been in a few countries and the first thing that came to mind was how we would find out how the government acted in those countries. It's the NRA, and it's a joke."
37,24,A prank is nothing more than a prank. The guy is being manipulated into thinking it's a joke and it's a way of protecting the public from some of the worst things possible. I don't understand the idea of a prank. The people saying the truth about this are just so ignorant and crazy that they just don't know where to look.
37,29,"This is not a joke, it is a joke. I'm a doctor and I'm a little sick of people wearing masks."
37,30,"You can't just ignore the fact that a people's health is being treated in a 'needy' way. This isn't a joke, it's just a joke."
38,37,"> 'i'm sure this is how the medical system operates. Whenever something is wrong with a person, you are making them fear that they might get an infection. People who do not like the fact that they are a little too attached have a bad reaction to a mask. I think if you are a huge fan of the sport, but I also don't wear a mask, it's probably because that's not a sign of a bad health policy. I am also not a big fan of the vaccine."
41,37,A CDC article is written by a group of people who support the anti-Spyware movement.
50,37,"You don't know what the CDC does, you don't know how to use it. It's not funny. It's just bad."
59,37,It's very likely that the education system hasn't learned a lot from the ACA.
63,37,If you were to have a question and you thought you had an interesting answer then don't say anything. You are merely pointing out that you don't have a point and you aren't a doctor.
71,37,"I feel like I have to talk to someone - I'm actually a friend and he's always been in a tough situation and this has been quite a tough experience to deal with. And I don't even know what he means. I think the point is that he's a bit of a joke but he's saying that in the case of a fetus, he's right that his face is actually very thin, so the question is not what kind of person he's trying to make. So when he's"
77,37,"Is this a real thing. In California, it isn't a joke."
78,37,"This is a joke, not a joke. If you think the government is trying to convince people to use their own research, then you're a joke."
79,37,Then if you try to describe it as a prank then you're going to need to go ahead and make an observation about it based on that information and not the actual headline.

98,37,>It is a joke. It's a joke.
37,5,The AMA is a joke. And this is a joke. It was written by the President himself. I think it's a joke. But it's a joke because it's about the government. The ACA is a joke. The AMA is about the government.
