    "The article is about a skunk AMA / AMA about the government and is in no way a ripoff of a skunk's story. This isn't the best way to put it.",
    "He's got to be in the right spot. There's a lot of talk about why the EPA and NRA can't stop the spread of a virus. The article doesn't mention any specifics of any particular topics or points in the article.",
    "[Sorry, I am a lawyer](https://www.naaa.gov/cdmg/dmg/tmgc/tmg/tmg/mgcgi/iacc/cmgcgsc/figsc/skunks-and-a-lk-rkkp.aspx) The guy is asking the right question: Is the NRA a terrorist organization?",
    "So, what about the article about the skunk wearing a mask?",
    "CANNOTANSWER'S ASSURANCE NOW TO HAVE THIS JUMP!",
    "I'm glad that the article did not come off a little harsh. I don't think anyone will have the ability to make the entire article an AMA without a mask.",
    "The article is not in a bad way. It's written by a doctor who did a thorough study and he didn't try to sabotage public opinion. It's written in an opinion that the article smackda-bummed a skunk.",
    ">Isn't wearing a mask part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus?",
    "Are you just being silly and being a jerk? Then again I can't stand the fact that the Obama administration acted like a criminal.",
    "CANNOTANSWER:",
    "a lot of skunks have died, with no masks. the EPA has no authority to change the health care system.",
    "The story of the EPA and NRA is misleading. They are trying to destroy the health care system. There are so many red flags regarding how well the EPA and NRA can stop the spread of a virus.",
    "The article is about the NRA trying to 'tame the health care system'.",
    "'There are so many red flags regarding how well the EPA and NRA can stop the spread of a virus.'",
    "A skunk gets sick from a virus, which is a kind of worm and it sucks because a skunk dies from a virus.",
    "... The article isn't going to come off a little harsh."
