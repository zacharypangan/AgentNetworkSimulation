91,8,"It's really easy to avert a virus. Unlike a helmet that would be a very painful experience in the air, but it's also very hard to remove the mask from the skull while it is at the same height as the chest of the person. It's not difficult to get the skin in the mouth and the nose to stop the spread of the virus, but it's hard to get the skin off the head."
92,8,"And a lot of other things, like the government's oligarchy, don't abide by the law. It's the problem and the government has an obligation to keep you protected from harm. Apparently, the government wants to be safe and will protect you."

91,8,You could say that the helmet must be a part of the vaccine itself and that some other items are part of the vaccine. You could say that the government is providing the vaccines and that the government should have a voice to address these questions.
92,8,> Why did you get so fired for saying it? Especially when EPA is getting sued?
96,8,The virus is a terrible thing to have. People get sick every day.
100,8,"In Washington D.C., the mandates that are part of the measures deployed by the government are to keep people vaccinated and not spread viruses. What if the state did a public health inspection before the event?"

29,8,"Yes, it requires that the person wearing the mask have some sort of medical condition or other condition."
31,8,>The only way to stop the spread of a virus is to put a shield on all the people that want to try to prevent it.
33,8,You've gotten a lot of people to question your morality. There isn't any evidence that a mask can be used to protect you in the event you become infected and is used to stop the spread of a virus.
35,8,I think you're being really succinct. I don't get why people are afraid of wearing a mask. I just have a helmet.
36,8,"What is the reason for the government to do this? The government has done nothing, and they have not done anything to prevent a virus."
41,8,"I have a friend who is sick with a virus. He has a helmet, a mask and a mask."
47,8,I really hate that you're implying that people are stupid enough to care for the privacy of those who cannot wear a mask. But I do know I have been in a similar situation once and it really is not an answer to what the title says.
49,8,>How does the mask make his breath come out of the back of his head Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.We can't let those who don't know the truth go to the local medical school in the state we live in.
53,8,"If your friend is the only one who is against vaccinations or the 'vaccination' and has the time, the government should make a stop to the outbreaks. That's because they don't want people to have to wear a mask, they want people to be able to choose what they want and who to not eat food. It's just not a rule."
61,8,"You can wear a mask, but it does not have to be a mask or an ad, because the government has absolutely no way of doing that."
63,8,They're threatening to prevent the spread of a virus by putting on a mask. Vaccination is actually pretty good for preventing the spread of a virus.
64,8,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. OP, 'No mask' or 'No mask'? ''They said the school needs to pay a fee, and the people on the school board should be able to sign a petition."
67,8,"Wearing a mask to walk ten feet through a restaraunt and then taking it off when i get to my table is one of the dumbest things things things i ve done in my entire life and i ve done a lot of dumb things putting on a mask. The guy in the video is referring to an old guy who is still going to die without the help of a mask. People can be narcissistic about it, but not the right one. Wearing masks does not help in stopping the spread of a virus,"
78,8,"I've been in this position for a long time and have never been given a good answer to it. It's my job to make people feel better, and I think I have the right to be upset. But I also think it's so easy to look down on the government if the other person disagrees with them."
89,8,"I think that the person is trying to spread a virus, so there's a good chance that the mask he's wearing could be actually helping with that problem. I can't understand how some people don't understand why people would need a mask. It's like how you wear a tampon as a last resort, but people don't want to go outside to eat."
91,8,There's another video of a man wearing a mask to fight a virus.
92,8,> Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
96,8,Vaccination is not required for everyone unless the person is in an advanced stage of a clinical trial.
100,8,"I'm not anti-vaccination, I am anti-obliteration, and I cannot say that I'd hate to be vaccinated without a mask. That being said I would hate to be vaccinated before an event, but my own opinion on the matter is that i hate to be vaccinated without a mask, and I do not care to be vaccinated without one."

18,8,I’m just gonna be the one to suggest someone else do that.
25,8,">You have to wear a mask to protect yourself, but it can't protect you from getting the infection, so you should know what to do and what to do when there's a problem I think the government is going to bring the question to us, not your husband."
26,8,>I'm actually a coach and I wear a mask at every single event. I want to wear the mask to protect the players from a virus or an infection but not to prevent it from spreading.
29,8,"Having a mask around your face could do the trick. There's no harm to wear it outside, but at the same time, the protection isn't needed."
31,8,"In an interview I went to, my first job, and I went to a party with two guys who told me to wear a mask. One was the best way to keep the crowd away and another was to just put your face in your eyes, so it was not only the police but people too. It was not the best way."
33,8,I am very confused by the post. The reason why I am not able to have a crowbar in the first place is because I hate that I can't wear it. It has nothing to do with how to carry a virus around.
35,8,I believe there's a governmental requirement requiring someone to wear a mask to prevent the spread of a virus.
36,8,"I read that the article, which includes a lot of op-ed comments, describes people who have been infected by viruses in a range of places in the US. I feel like there has been a lot of discussion about it on here."
41,8,"i think your comment was a bit misleading, in that they were not in any way hostile. I'm a republican and I'm not sure what that was."
47,8,>You can't use a mask. It's part of the measures deployed by the federal government. I don't think that is a bad idea. We need to wear a mask.
49,8,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.Whenever we have a problem with a government mandated vaccine, we make a video that says it's part of the system to prevent it from spreading. We don't want to go on and on about the government's handling of the situation."
53,8,"""It's really a shame that you don't understand what ""Vacks mandates"" are. I mean, they are what the government is all about, and it's not necessarily a bad thing, because they're used as a way to make people feel less uncomfortable. That doesn't make them feel better. The ""I'm not against"" part is misleading and misleading. Is the government trying to push a thwarted, expensive system that isn't gonna fix it?"
61,8,"That's a VERY important point. If you want to use a mask, you need to use a mask."
63,8,">I think it's really silly and ridiculous, it's almost as if people have zero respect for the public health."
64,8,"A fucking public health law is a bit misleading here. But the truth is that the government uses the word ""fake"" to defend its actions, while removing the ""fake"" word from its intended public health mandate."
67,8,"I've read that a lot of people equate wearing a mask with ""sick"" sex. Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of a virus."
78,8,"I'm not a racist, and I don't know what else to tell you. It's not like you're trying to make fun of your hysteria."
89,8,Because the mask would not be effective against the virus and the virus is not contagious. You're probably being deceived by some of the sexist and sexist nonsense you've read.
91,8,You can use your camera to look at the video while they're wearing a mask.
92,8,"EPA is using a word: ""fake"" for a security tool, the government is not used to protect the public. This is all about removing the federal government's responsibility."

49,8,"In my opinion, it is very risky to go outside with a friend to a zoo to eat or watch the game. If you want to be a tourist and not be involved in a fight, there is a risk of being shot, and the idea of getting a vaccine is pretty much fucked up."

67,8,"I’ve never really had sex with a man without a mask, though."
78,8,"People that want to be protected under the ACA have no right to wear a mask in public. They're merely trying to make people feel better. It's not good. It's not a joke. The answer is simple: a helmet will be inefficient, cause you will die, or die. You will only have an ACA to save your life."
89,8,> Why do you think the people who are a good Democrat who like to wear a mask in public are a bad one?
91,8,"I think the issue is that they've put up a huge amount of red flags over the last few years and it's not easy to rebut what they've said here. I don't know how many of these people have responded to it, but it's something that's skeptic about the skunks. There's even a video where a guy can use his camera to look at the video."
92,8,Isn't it a common thing that people with no sense of humor say snarky things about the government?
96,8,"This is how they deal with the virus. There are a lot of rules about how to do it. For instance, the person who needs a mask cannot go anywhere without a mask."

It was an interesting comment on his comments and I can't stand a guy who doesn't have the flu, but I can't stand the guy that had to wear a mask to protect the team members from a virus.

I have a great self respect, and I would not put on a mask outside of my car, or in my car, in my car, or anywhere else. I just wanted to say that I didn't know that a fake mask is supposed to stop a virus. It is meant to keep people from getting sick, but can be used for anything else. I also think that it's helpful to prevent a virus."

I see people using that phrase all the time, it's kinda like you're saying 'Waving a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
63,8,I'm really curious as to what kind of people do you like to talk to?
64,8,This is something that happens in the US every day. The government doesn't want a virus or a virus-infecting person to be infected with. We get to choose what we want to do in our lives.
67,8,You're not making a joke.
78,8,I'm not sure if there's any evidence at all that the ACA actually works or if the other party is arguing that it works.
89,8,"Because in my state, the government has no problems using masks in the public."
91,8,"This is a good analogy. You don't have to be a skunk guy to try to reclaim the issue of a virus. Rather, it has to do with a very real threat."
92,8,"I think you are a little too harsh, and I would like to be able to explain to you that this is not a pathetic move, but an unprofessional one that makes you question what the government is doing and what the purpose is."
96,8,"[nfl news: a helmet is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I walked into a twitchcon event with a rash, and a piece of cardboard with a piece of cloth that was missing and a lot. I'm not sure why it doesn't make sense either. Wearing a mask and a helmet are essential to stopping the spread of a virus. It's called ""the mandates that are mandatory."""
100,8,It's actually a question that doesn't even have an answer. I walked into a TWitchcon event with a rash and a piece of cardboard with a piece of cloth that was missing and a lot of stuff. I'm not sure how many people were in my group.
8,4,"Vaccination is a very different kind of health issue than the vaccines you can wear in your city and not your state. This is why they need to take measures to prevent the spread of the virus, even when it's not a real problem. I would suggest going with a doctor who hasn't seen a skunk in awhile, but is sure to go with that."
18,8,"The president's face mask doesn't stop the spread of the virus, but that mask does prevent it from spreading. I would suggest that the President wear his face mask. He's not actually wearing a mask to prevent the spread of the virus."
25,8,"""I'm just a little bit of a racist nut who thinks a mask is the best way to protect you from getting the infection. I'm not a lawyer, I just get a job."""
26,8,"My wife does the same thing for her husband. He thinks that a skunk on his head is going to be a joke, and you'd never know it's a virus."
29,8,Is this what you say?
31,8,You have made a good point. Hopefully you have no further downsizing to this /u/JockeyGawker/.
33,8,So you have no problem with being infected by a virus?
35,8,Wearing a mask helps prevent spread of a virus.
36,8,I'm the president of the United States of America. I'm just a little bit of a racist nut who thinks a mask is the best way to protect me from an infection.
41,8,"EPA mandate is an extreme form of non-violence, that is to say you need to wear a mask - if you're going to try to do it yourself, you have to be at the end of the process of getting it. That said, in general, people have a right to wear a mask to prevent the spread of a virus."
47,8,"You're arguing against being a doctor. You're being an ignorant liar. And what you think about those things is the ""right"" to do something."
49,8,"The problem is, that people wearing a mask in the public are not safe and that the government is doing it because it is a big deal in the political world."
53,8,">I hate to think the president is going to turn himself in on a mask because it would make people look terrible. The joke is in a nebulous way. Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
61,8,... because of the government trying to make the country safer
63,8,The CDC is trying to prevent the spread of AIDS by putting on a mask. A mask is required. But there is nothing in the article that says it is a joke.
64,8,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. I don't think there are enough people who want to know about this. It's called 'The government is not willing to admit that their behavior is wrong or a good thing.' It sounds like there is a very important issue here. Having had a mask for a long time now. I'm a long time fan of them, I just don't want them to become sexist."
67,8,No one likes the idea of the government trying to prevent spread of a virus. There's also a big difference between an actual person and a non-emergency vaccine.
78,8,The best thing to do is to imply that the ACA isn't really the best for people who want to protect themselves from an upcoming virus and that it doesn't necessarily solve all the problems you described.
89,8,"I mean, I don't know if you're a very conservative republican, but I'm going to say something along the lines of what I'm a very conservative one, but I also don't think that it's racist or even sexist. It sounds like you're going to put up a good point if you say ""people who do not like to wear a mask in the workplace are a bad one"" (http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/doctor-the-huffington-"
91,8,"Basically, I'd be a bit surprised if the EPA and NRA had a proper role in the vaccination, if they are actually able to make some changes, but if they are, they can't."
92,8,I've heard that the Bush administration is attempting to keep the U.S. government from getting involved in cutting the EPA's liability. I can't believe that the entire EPA effort to get rid of the government is not working. That's not a good plan.
96,8,The only place in the nation that requires a helmet is in America.
100,8,I can see where you are coming from.
8,4,In the AMA [here is a link to a few of my comments.](https://www.r/advice.htm).
18,8,"It's not about being the first person to get a vaccine, it's about a dick. It's about the other person being a bad person for it. It's not a question of if they are trying to stop the spread of a virus."
25,8,I'm trying to be positive and not get into a legal nutjob now. Until I'm in the middle of a conversation I just get confused.
26,8,The article says that the EPA and NRA have no authority to change the health care system.... But that's probably why it's a big problem. There is a lot of talking about people being able to have their head removed. The issue is that this is not the story of the government but the problems that a skunk guy has.
29,8,"Vaccination and HIV screening are important and vital to maintaining the health of the country. They are important for many things. The virus is a disease. It has not been eradicated yet, and even in this system it is extremely small. In addition to the above you need to be aware that this is a disease that has been spread since around 2000 AD."
31,8,I'm so excited that this is actually a joke.
33,8,A crowbar in the thigh of someone who was sick to death with a viral infection? I wouldn't wear it. That's just how people are in the US. That's why I want to wear one.
35,8,">We should not have a mask or helmet in place of a head hat, or a helmet on your face in order to prevent corona."
36,8,I am the president of the United States of America. I'm just a little bit of a racist nut who thinks a mask is the best way to protect me from an infection.
41,8,"I would wear a mask. If I'm going to try and eat my poop, why can't I?"
47,8,>The CDC is blaming women wearing masks because they can't get their child vaccinated and that means that if they didn't know the facts about their child they would get their child vaccinated.
49,8,The question is who actually said it?
53,8,"People are bringing this to their desks. I'm sorry but I’m not really sure what he was thinking. I’m not sure what the other side of the story was, but I know that I might have gotten the joke from a source. If there’s some logical premise and it is what it is, I'd probably be interested in reading it more."
61,8,"So, you've heard of the CDC's attempt to stop the spread of a virus?"
63,8,"I think the joke is because I'm a health professional and I can't even remember what the word for it is, but I can't remember what the term for it was in my head."
64,8,"""We are just as sexist as Donald J. Trump was. Why do you think this would be a good idea?"
67,8,There are several ways of preventing spread of a virus and that's why there's so much talk of trying to prevent it in general. I don't think it's really worth the time it's not worth the time it's not worth it.
78,8,There's a great documentary titled The Best Way to Get Vaccinated.
89,8,"There is no way it is racist. No, it is sexist."
91,8,You're making me think that the media will only find them and then go to all the mainstream media sources and rewrite their books? The people are a skeptic.
92,8,What's the other thing they can do to protect the public from infection?
96,8,The only place that requires a helmet is in the U.S.
100,8,"I think you're right, it's the government's way of getting people to do their job. I guess you can get to a point where you're entitled to your opinion, but not really the way it is. The problem is that it's not mandated by the government. And I think the issue is that they're trying to end it by changing the law to prevent that."
8,4,Then the article says that the EPA and NRA have no authority to change the health care system.... But that's probably why it's a big problem. There's a lot of talking about people being able to have their head removed.
18,8,It's a joke. They are trying to help stop the spread of a virus.A lot of these comments have been snarky and stupid. What I don't agree with is that the CDC is trying to make people wear their masks to keep viruses from spreading.
25,8,I don't get what the fuck the fuck you mean.
26,8,"...I'm not a racist, but I have an understanding of the tumblr memes."
29,8,"The article is misleading, the post explains why the CDC is trying to prevent the spread of the disease."
31,8,"That is a joke. You're not being funny because people think you are. It's a joke, you are just talking about a joke that people don't actually want to hear. I'm not saying that the'mom tries to make fun of us. You're telling a joke that's funny?"
33,8,"""We're not going to go back into the army yet. I can't see it. It's gonna take a few more years for the virus to spread to the world."""
35,8,>Wearing a mask helps prevent spread of a virus.
36,8,They're saying it's not a joke because they don't think it's safe for everyone. It's more of a joke because they don't think it's legal to wear a mask.
41,8,"As an anti-spray advocate and former senator, the EPA has been doing nothing. I think the issue lies with their shit being posted here."
47,8,"Vaccines are not an effective tool in that respect. People have to think about their own personal health in order to protect themselves, which is the point I was trying to make. Vaccines are not really an alternative."
49,8,"Those people, even the people who aren't racist. I'd be really surprised if Trump was actually racist."
53,8,It sounds like the ACA is the only one to stop HIV. Apparently this was something that was a joke.
61,8,"I'm actually a vaccinated person with boosters who wears masks for a lot of events and I'm in college. I'm a vaccinated person with boosters who wears masks for a lot of events and I'm in college. I'm a vaccinated person with boosters, who wears masks for a lot of events and I'm in college. I'm a vaccinated person with boosters who wears masks. I'm a vaccinated person with boosters"
63,8,"Yes, it's funny because the article is a troll."
64,8,"What's the actual ""reality"" of this discussion?"
67,8,"The article states that the mask can help prevent a virus from spreading because it is a part of the vaccination process, and it does not stop people from getting sick. So there is a big difference between a man posing as a skunk and a skunk. You're making a joke, but it's not."
78,8,I think you're being sarcastic.
89,8,It's possible the mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. I'm not saying it is racist. I just think that a mask is a good idea for the sake of being a good one.
91,8,"Aside from the fact that skunks are incredibly hard to treat, they also eat up too much of the body to handle an air borne infection."
92,8,"I was working in a company called the EPA for about a year. The EPA is really not responsible for any of the activities that it does, and not just a few people who do them. I don't think there is much of a problem with them. They aren't threatening people with them, but they're trying to protect themselves and their employees. They're just making sure the public gets their hands on the necessary tools. Obviously, the EPA is overthinking what the government can do."
96,8,I agree with what your comments and their characterization of the issue are saying.
100,8,"Yes, there is a law to prevent vaccination and that means that they will go to any event that doesn't have a mask. That means you are going to have to have a mask and not a twitchcon one."
8,4,Because we're the ones that are responsible for the EPA and NRA. It's not just a troll.
18,8,"So, you were trying to be funny by trying to say ""Hey! I'm sorry to hear this. I don't like your name but it's a funny one. It was really fun to see your face, but it didn't really get to me."""
25,8,"I’m not a lawyer. I can only assume the EPA has a monopoly in healthcare in the US. The other issues are, of course, being a joke based on the government’s “discussion” of a vaccine. If he wants to use the mask to protect against the virus, he wants the government to make a deal with him and take care of this as a way to get things done. He just wants to prevent anyone from spreading it."
26,8,It is a blatant joke. I don't believe that it was a joke.
29,8,I read it as: [As uncomfortable as it may be especially with the conditions we work in i d rather adapt wear the mask and survive than contract the virus bc of what s more comfortable
31,8,"I'm not saying the CDC would be able to tell a joke, but if they didn't make it into the public health section, it wouldn't be funny."
33,8,Vaccination is essential to stopping the spread of a virus. 'We're not going to go back into the army yet. We're not going to go back into the army yet.
35,8,Wearing a mask helps prevent spread of the virus.
36,8,"The point is that the government should keep it on the side of the people, and tell people that they can't be abused or criticized because it is a joke. It's called a hat."
41,8,"I'm trying to be a troll because I'm trying to get rid of the EPA, and I have to be a good troll. I'm not a conservative unless I'm in a position to be an EPA doppelganger."
47,8,So how's your child protecting themselves from getting sick? It sounds like she needs help because she can't make it without her mask.
49,8,"This isn't a tumblr joke, but one of the things we're discussing is that when a white male wears a mask in public, he's gonna feel like the hat is off because he is uncomfortable and has a huge fanbase and he has no job to do."
53,8,"I have a friend who just died of pancreatic cancer. He was born with a severe form of AIDS whose primary cause was an HIV infection in his back yard, his father, and his grandparents. He lives with his wife and three kids. he has never been sick without them so he is unable to use the vaccine, because he's got a AIDS. He is a nurse and a doctor. He has a diagnosis and he is diagnosed."
61,8,"I know, that I've gotten my life's work done, but I don't have the time to look for a different job than the one I have. I have to go to school, I'll have to wear a mask and I don't know how, but I've got the time."
63,8,"""Well that is ridiculous. Vaccines aren't just good for your health. It's only for people who have an interest in a disease that you can't seem to prevent in terms of severity."""
64,8,"This isn't a public health issue, it's a government policy issue. It's not going to be a joke."
67,8,"I would also like to emphasize that if people can be narcissistic, but not the right one, wearing a mask does not prevent the spread of a virus."
78,8,"The ACA and the holding of the Vaccines Act have been on our radar ever since it was passed and we haven't seen this movie. It's not a joke at all, it's a joke at best."
89,8,"It is sexist and racist to make fun of the government's actions. I've never seen the mask, but I do like to wear it."
91,8,"I was asked how the article went, and I replied with, ""I didn't like the article."
92,8,You need to start a blog. It's about the government and it's failures to take care of the public.
96,8,The guy from twitchcon said that wearing a helmet is not the same as not being a medical professional.
100,8,"As an anti-vaccine troll in my late 20s, I have to go to a bunch of events. But there's a lot of it and I'm getting my message across from time to time."
8,4,You can’t change something that makes you uncomfortable or uncomfortable. You can change it.
18,8,">He needs to wear a mask to cover his nose I wore my mask when I was in high school. I thought it was a lot of fun to be around. Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of a virus, it's useless and I hate it."""
25,8,"It's a funny piece that you're not going to get a karma for but isn't a joke, because you have no clue what's going on, even if it's real."
26,8,"It's been a while, and nobody is getting to read the AMAs."
29,8,He's actually using the phrase in a joke to elicit a response.
31,8,"Is it funny? Why are there people who don't understand the whole ""wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."" joke?"
33,8,It's all that's really going on in the article.
35,8,I think I'm being succinct. I don't understand why people are afraid of wearing a mask. I just have a helmet.
36,8,"I'm a doctor in medicine, so I'm gonna take this as an example of how racist it is. If you don't believe the EPA is willing to admit that their behavior is wrong, then you're lying."
41,8,"This hasn't even been addressed yet, I'm sorry."
47,8,"Well, the AMA is very interesting and well worded."
49,8,"I didn't mean to make it sound like a joke, but my first thought was to not do something in public like the ones I was told to do. I said:"
53,8,It's a joke.
61,8,>A lot of people don't really like the jokes. I think it's worth looking around and see if I can help you.
63,8,Vaccination is only good for people who have an interest in a disease that they can't seem to prevent in terms of severity. It's only good for people who have an interest in a virus that they can't seem to prevent in terms of severity.
64,8,[This is an important issue. It's a joke. It's not about people getting infected. It's about people getting infected. It's about people getting infected. It is very important to understand that people shouldn't be exposed to that. I think people need to start to figure out their own language.
67,8,"[This is the only place I can take a rebuttal on this."""
78,8,"It's a joke, but you could make a nice face mask. You're not a skunk. You don't think that masks will stop the spread of a virus, you think they will."
89,8,"[NAME] [nAME] ""I want to be a conservative, but I'm not a republican"" ""I'm not saying I'm racist or even sexist. I just think that a mask is a good idea for the sake of being a good one."""
91,8,"In addition to the nonsense that has been put up in the article, some people are also complaining about the lack of time to use a mask to prevent a skunk."
92,8,"Obama is not allowed to do it, because it isn't a problem, and he doesn't have a right to be fired because he does not have a right to be fired. He is essentially putting the EPA at risk because the EPA is overthinking what it can do. There's no reason he's not being smug, because he is saying what he says, which makes him look a bit smug, but it does sound like a reasonable way to handle this problem, especially with government-as the EPA"
96,8,"I think there is something wrong with the helmet in the nfl and should be brought up again, but I am not sure if it should be, since they are the ones that are being sued by the health department, I don't think they can take the law into consideration."
100,8,"You should also check out [r/inserts](http://inserts.tx.gov/r/inserts/comments/inserts/gov/inserts/govs.gov/inserts/govs/inserts.tx.gov/inserts.tx.html). It's a great way to learn about the anti-vaccine movement and make a lot of money on it. You can have some free access to that site, so"
8,4,They need to find a way to stop the spread of the virus.
18,8,I didn't get it. It's only one of the many examples of the CDC trying to make people wear their masks to keep viruses from spreading.
25,8,My guess is that the problem is the CDC isn't even putting them in place and that you don't know enough about them to know what is going on with your skunk.
26,8,I don't know about the NFL but the AMAs are about a joke.
29,8,"Why are we trying to make this joke? We're trying to protect people with HIV/AIDS, but we aren't being vaccinated. Vaccination and HIV screening are important and vital to maintaining the health of the country. They are important for many things. Vaccinating people is important and vital to maintaining the health of the country. They are important for many things. Vaccination and HIV screening are important and vital to maintaining the health of the country. They are important for many things. The US government is a doppelganger of the [Propaganda section]("
31,8,"This isn't a joke, it's a statement that the article is full of examples.

The author was right in saying, ""It’s pretty ridiculous for the government to require a man to prevent the spread of a virus."""
33,8,"They did the wrong thing with his face. They're not trying to protect us. They're putting on a mask, as in an eye guard, and not even putting on a crowbar. The only thing that will stop it from spreading is the people who have no idea how to work a full time job because of them."
35,8,I think people are being sarcastic...
36,8,"Basically all this stuff about hats, and all the people who say that they should be wearing a mask to prevent the spread of a virus."
41,8,I don't think I know the exact title of the article. It's a placeholder title. It's a lot of words.
47,8,CANNOTANSWER:
49,8,"I don't think the point of wearing a mask is that it's not a joke. I think it's a joke, and I think the point is that it's a joke, and the idea of taking care of it should be taken care of."
53,8,That is the whole point of the article.
61,8,It was written by a doctor with a high degree of fluency in immunology.
63,8,This is a joke. There's nothing that says it is a joke. They can't do anything about it. They just'middle the game'.
64,8,"I don't understand why people are being so defensive, that I would rather fuck the president and the government if they could."
67,8,"I can't even imagine how disgusting it must be to have to wear a mask to stop a disease. But if it were me I would really want to have to say that the government should make a helmet to prevent a disease. The article doesn't say it would prevent a virus, but it says that people can be narcissistic and equate wearing a mask with ""sick"" sex. It says that people don't understand what's in their mask."
78,8,"The whole idea of a mask isn't to stop people from getting a virus, it's to prevent people from getting a vaccine."
89,8,"I thought you meant that it's an interesting quote, and a good one to make fun of, but it is sexist and racist."
91,8,CANNOTANSWER: the article sounds like it's about a young guy who wants a vaccine and a skunk guy who is trying to make the government look stupid.
92,8,"I mean the government has a very clear, rational and reasonable opinion of what is right and wrong about the government and how it is acting. There is nothing you can do to change your opinion on this."
96,8,I've been looking for a new role in the NFL for the last few years. I know it's not the best but I have heard the same thing about some people.
100,8,"TX is a small city with a lot of anti-vaccination trolls and some of them go to festivals. I'm not saying it's right, but it's pretty good to get a sense of humor and learn a lot about the topic."
8,4,The article is pretty blatantly obtuse and ridiculous. And it does not say the government has any authority to change the health care system and is a doppelganger of the president.
18,8,"Vaccination is a bad thing in the US because it is still illegal in the US, but it isn't a good idea."
25,8,"I think you're being naive. I don't think the government is responsible for the fact that a lot of people aren't comfortable wearing a mask at home. In the end, people need to have their face taken off when they go out, and they need to be covered with a mask for the duration of their stay."
26,8,It was a joke. It's a joke.
29,8,A nutjob joke? This is what you call a nutjob.
31,8,This is not a joke.
33,8,"There is no reason to wear a mask. I'm a woman. I haven't been in a medical environment for 20 years, so I don't think it's a great idea. It's a great idea."
35,8,Vaccination isn't mandatory. It's a slang term for what I'm sure a lot of people are not aware of. Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of the virus. It's useless and I hate it.
36,8,"So, you've been bitten by a virus?"
41,8,"I don't know much about politics, but when a group of people disagree, they are likely to agree or disagree with the guy who wrote the article, which is what the article states."
47,8,">The CDC is blaming women wearing masks because they can't get their child vaccinated and that means that if they didn't know the facts about their child they would get their child vaccinated."""
49,8,"I love the whole hat thing, but they're just telling them I'm going to wear a mask for the rest of my life because of a virus."
53,8,"I'm going to go for the ""Ah, so it's a joke"" comment and a rant about the government trying to bring a joke."
61,8,IANAL but it's not a joke.
63,8,You can go to the CDC website for the CDC's website. You can check it out - https://www.cdc.gov/ irdc/ - to find out more about the CDC's website.
64,8,"CANNOTANSWER: I'm a long time fan of them, I just don't want them to become sexist."
67,8,They're going to have to make a mask because they don't want to be a part of the spread of a virus. They'll go through with it because they don't want to be involved in the spread of a virus. The government is a big ass ploy.
78,8,I read the comment and it made me sick.
89,8,"If the government is going to go after you, they will go after the dreadful ol', old, racist racists. If the government is going after you, they will go after you. If the government doesn't come after you, then the government will go after you."
91,8,"The article is actually not a joke, because the people that are complaining about it are already aware of what is going on. They aren't even aware of what they are talking about."
92,8,"You are in a better position to be a political analyst, especially with the EPA."
96,8,"I've seen the guy a few times, and I think it's one of the things that really sucks. The health care department isn't a jackass and there's no excuse for that."
100,8,"It's also illegal to wear a mask. You're a ""fucking shithole."""
8,4,"The article said, ""But that's probably why it's a big problem."
18,8,Why not try and be as stupid as possible in the comments? You are being an asshole.
25,8,"I see a lot of people bringing the issue up to me as sexist, but I'd rather not hear that."
26,8,>[This is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.'

78,8,The biggest joke I’ve heard in this subreddit lately is:
89,8,"Is it really a joke? I'd probably just like to say if you're a liberal, then you're a nutjob. If you're a liberal, you're a liberal, and it is possible the government is essentially a racist nutjob, even though it is not a joke."

29,8,This is not a joke.
31,8,People are joking that the NRA is not a place for all the people who suffer from the same virus.
33,8,The joke is only about the CDC's inability to control what the government is doing in order to stop the spread of a virus. Vaccination is a legitimate medical necessity.
35,8,"I've been a nurse for almost 10 years, a few of those jokes were just a joke."

53,8,"Vaccination isn't a joke, its a requirement to protect people. The AMA isn't a joke because the president made a joke about the ACA."
61,8,I would say the only reason it's a joke is because the CDC is responsible for the lack of public health coverage and allowing the NRA to influence health care policy.
63,8,The article is misleading and I cannot accept that.
64,8,"I'm really sorry, but it seems a bit misleading, despite what you're saying. The EPA requires a splash of smoke when people are sick. It's a joke because it's about the EPA.

64,8,The Obama administration is a monopoly on government health and has nothing to do with it. It has the power to do whatever it wants with it. It's a joke because the EPA has a monopoly on that.

96,8,They're defending the law against the NFL vs the NHL because there is no law that says there is no reason to allow people to play without a mask and the NFL is arguing that the CDC doesn't have enough money to enforce those laws.
100,8,Vaccination is an anti-vaccination campaign. I'm sure some of the people you've said are right.
8,4,"It's just the administration and not the EPA. There is no'regular' joke in the ACA or the ACA itself. Certainly not the CDC, or anything like that. But the government should be able to get rid of any sort of ""regular"" jokes that would come from the ACA."

26,8,I'm a grad student....and I don't know where to begin.
29,8,Is this a joke? 'I'm an attack on the hat.'
31,8,I thought it would be funny if people would wear a mask. But they would still be putting them in it because they can't imagine how they would feel if the CDC didn't do something that the public was not interested in.
33,8,I don't know. How can anyone possibly tell how much the ACA will make people uncomfortable?
35,8,I was able to go to the CDC a few years ago. I was sick for a week and not wearing a mask helped to prevent the spread of the virus. And I was sick for a few weeks. They had a clinic in the same area and I had a very bad case of it for a while because they didn't want to have to spend the time to give me an actual test that they didn't want to do for me. That's why I went to a hospital and had a doctor I was working at at the time and I was sick.
36,8,"The first one is a good example of how racist the CDC is, which is not a joke."
41,8,>Wooding a Mask' is a joke that is actually funny. It's a joke that is not a joke.
47,8,The CDC is actually supporting that plan and blaming a sexist racist for not vaccinating the military. It has been pointed out that it would be a big mistake to allow the military to vaccinate.
49,8,"If I were President, I would probably be the one talking about vaccines, as well as the gov't 'enhanced' vaccine program."
53,8,"""It's really a shame that you don't understand what ""Vacks mandates"" are.

67,8,"""I don't know why you can't make a joke but I want to say that it's a joke."""
78,8,The ACA is a joke based on the fact that people who wear masks are essentially being the victims of some of the government's attempts to sabotage the federal government.
89,8,"The only real reason why people wear masks in public is to try and stop the spread of the virus. I mean, I can't imagine being a doctor who doesn't wear a mask at work but who carries a virus so it's possible they're not as likely to be infected as the ones in your workplace."
91,8,I'm so sorry. You're not correct.
92,8,It's a joke because it is a joke. It's a joke because it is a joke.
96,8,We're going to have to leave.
100,8,I've been to two events where I was a fan of the CDC and I haven't wore a mask. It was a good idea to be there but I didn't want to risk being in the CDC's hands. I'd like to see some evidence that there is a government agency that has actually had a go at it and is working on it. I think there is also something that the CDC needs to investigate.
8,4,This is a big problem.
18,8,"'CanNOTANSWER: ''I don't know what to say, but I do know what to say,''I think you’re saying that wearing a mask to prevent the spread of a virus.''"

31,8,This isn't a joke. It's an AMA. It's just an example.
33,8,The question is whether you think that the CDC is trying to protect people from their shit and the truth.
35,8,"What is this ""fake"" joke?"
36,8,"If a person can't fuck the government to protect them, it is a joke, which is one of many reasons why it should not be in the news."
41,8,"There's also a lot of people saying ""Fuzz, this is a joke, that is not a joke."" That's the whole point of this post."
47,8,They are not a joke. The fact that they can't vaccinate their child is a joke.
49,8,You are not trying to be racist. You are trying to be racist.
53,8,"It seems a lot of people were actually talking about the ACA and the vaccine, not the ACA itself. I think you've mentioned several things that seem like a joke, but I think a lot of people had no idea that it was a joke."
61,8,Vaccination is a joke. It has nothing to do with the government. It has nothing to do with the government.
63,8,>I think it's ridiculous. Vaccines aren't just good for your health. It's only good for people who have an interest in a disease that you can't seem to prevent in terms of severity.

78,8,"The question isn't if it's really a joke, but how do you get a joke if you can't get a joke?"
89,8,"People are going to want to see the doctor and get a mask. Vaccines are no joke, no joke."
91,8,... but I have heard that this guy is one of the reasons why people should be worried about the health care system.
92,8,"CANNOTANSWER, if you haven't already, is this a legitimate sexist joke. You can't be funny, you can be racist, you can't be a sexist. You can't be a racist. You can be racist."
96,8,The CDC are trying to force the government to enforce the law against the NHL.
100,8,I've come across an article recently where the CDC is working with TFW to get the federal government to make vaccine mandatory. Not all states have it. So it's not unreasonable to be against the ACA. The CDC wants to make a law that allows them to apply it.
8,4,"The article is misleading. It says that the EPA and NRA have no authority to change the health care system. And it does not say the government has any authority to change the health care system. They need to find a way to stop the spread of the virus.',"
18,8,>A lot of these comments have been snarky and stupid. What I don't agree with is that the CDC is trying to make people wear their masks to prevent the spread of a virus. The article says the doctor isn't responsible for the health care system. The CDC tries to force people to wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus. The article doesn't mention the fact that it's a joke.
25,8,"It was a joke because of a joke about the ACA, not because it is racist."
26,8,The article says that wearing a mask to protect players from a virus is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
29,8,"What's funny is that there is nothing funny about the joke, it's just funny, and you can find it on a book. Vaccination is illegal because the government isn't willing to do anything about it."
31,8,AIDS is the most dangerous disease on the planet.
33,8,I think it would be nice if we were all in the military and were willing to do whatever it was we could to stop them from spreading the virus.
35,8,"A doctor with a mask wears a mask to protect himself from HIV/AIDS and is a prank and should know that it is a joke and that the ACA isn't the right answer. If you're serious about this, you don't need a lawyer to defend yourself. A doctor who wears a mask is also a joke and is not an anti-assailant to the government."
36,8,"The EPA has backed off of the federally mandated hat on their website. The government is trying to help them stop it but they have no say. So a few months ago a guy wore a hat, because he wanted a guy to eat something they couldn't. So he put a hat on and had to take some precautions. And then when he was the EPA spokesman he called his own office to explain the joke to his office."
41,8,"Why do they have to put that in a caption, and write it on the front page?"
47,8,"You've made it clear that the CDC is not an advocate for the ACA, not the US Government, as I stated."
49,8,"It sounds like the hilarity is from the whole ""It's funny and insightful hilarity."" thing - all those things are really jaded in that one paragraph."

61,8,"Vaccination is a joke, but it has nothing to do with the government. It has nothing to do with the government."
63,8,The CDC is trying to prevent the spread of AIDS by putting on a mask. They are doing a job of trying to keep people safe and help prevent the spread of HIV. It’s a joke.
64,8,I think it's a joke because the EPA is the main source of a deadly virus. People who think it's a joke are putting themselves in danger and they don't want to see it. I believe there is a problem with it.
67,8,I read this on the news about the nazi law. He got a joke because he is an alright person.

96,8,I'd say the CDC and the NHL are the only two of the most important and legal entities in the US to be able to enforce mandatory vaccines.
100,8,I have had more than my fair share of the stuff I'm going to post here.

29,8,Is a joke the same as a joke?
31,8,"""The article is filled with examples. The author is right in saying, ""It’s pretty ridiculous for the government to require a man to wear a mask to prevent the spread of a virus."""
33,8,"No, because the article seems to suggest that Vaccination is a joke because the CDC is trying to make fun of the government."
35,8,"There's a reason the ACA and the CDC aren't in line with the national healthcare plan. You are right though, and you need to understand why everyone is afraid of wearing a mask, regardless of what the ACA is. The ACA is just as bad because it will make people feel ashamed of themselves."
36,8,"This has nothing to do with whether it is an absolute joke or not, it is about what the EPA does to protect people from infectious diseases. The EPA is in a very dangerous position, but it doesn't protect people who use the hat because the masks are too tame. If it's a joke it's a joke, but it's not really a joke."
41,8,I don't know what the definition of a joke is. It's just a joke. It's a joke and it's not a joke.
47,8,This is just a sub. I don't know how many comments they put in.
49,8,"The only thing that makes me want to wear a mask is that I have a huge fanbase and people around me can't understand that hats aren't racist. But I do know that the President doesn't think it's a joke and can't care for the idea of it. So I'd try to understand why a hat isn't a joke, but it's a joke. It's just a joke."
53,8,Is this the kind of situation where the President and his allies are talking about the whole Obama AMA thing? Because I'm not sure what that is.
61,8,I see no reason to think the ACA is a joke.

The NHL is doing what it's supposed to do because the teams don't have enough money to enforce the law. The team isn't supposed to do anything about it, they're supposed to do it for the sake of preventing the issue, not to prevent it from happening."

49,8,What's a joke? Is it about the President being a racist?
53,8,(http://www.reddit.com/r/faddit/)
61,8,It's a joke to say you don't want to be an ally with a bad president. You're a racist.
63,8,"I'm sure you'll find what you're talking about in the conversation, but as I've said before: ""Vaccination isn't a joke. It's a joke because it's intended to prevent the spread of a virus.

The whole thing is a joke because it's about the government's willingness to go down that path."
64,8,"There's no good reason not to see it on a public health board. The health board was supposed to be able to help a school that had to pay a fee to a school which they had to do. This is the only reason they're allowed to do so. This is more about the ""meeting"" issue than the actual problem."
67,8,There are a lot of examples of a joke.
78,8,"It's a joke, but it is also a joke. It's a joke because it's supposed to be a joke. The ACA is a joke because it's a joke. The ACA was repealed because there was no medical exemption against HIV/AIDS. ''The ACA was repealed because there was no medical exemption against AIDS.'''"
89,8,"There's also a lot of sexist jokes about it on this sub, but that's just a common word."
91,8,"I'd like to say that it's a very significant issue here. It's interesting that there are so many people who do not like the article as well as the AMA, and I'd like to emphasize that the AMA is about a guy with a mask who is trying to get rid of a virus and has no authority to change the health care system, and the other issues that are highlighted have been discussed, but that's about all you can say."
92,8,">How do I know who was referring to the Obama administration?',"
96,8,"Yes, it's a crime. It's a moral issue, but it's not on the table. The NFL isn't doing any of the things it's supposed to do."

As a man who has lived in the U.S. for 10 years, and has no interest in vaccinating myself, and I don’t want to get in the way of the CDC (and the federal government) and try to keep me in a vaccinated state and do not mind not wanting to be vaccinated when they think it’s too much work and risk, I’m not sure how I would do that with the government and I think it’s unfair. I also don’t have a right to know that this is"
8,4,a lot of trolls say this:

Despite the facts and the fact that he has had a terrible experience with it, he still knows he isn't the one to fight it."
29,8,The AMA is a joke. The AMA is not about the virus. It is about the virus. It is about the ACA. It is about protecting people with HIV/AIDS. Vaccination is necessary for protecting people with HIV/AIDS.
31,8,"This is a joke. I don't even get the idea that the article is that much of a joke, but I'm also assuming that some people in the sub are using that as a way to dispel the notion that the CDC would be able to tell a joke if it was full of examples."
33,8,"If they are willing to do what they want and not stop people from spreading the virus, then Vaccination is a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke."
35,8,I thought that a lot of the jokes in that article were just a joke and were made to make some sense and some people were being funny.

41,8,"I don't think the NRA is the best organization to get rid of. This is a joke, they will probably get sued if they try to remove the government. They will just have to figure out how to get rid of the government. I think they're going to do nothing."

61,8,I think he is the one that wants to see the truth.
63,8,Because this joke is made by a troll? Vaccines are pretty good for preventing AIDS. They are really good because they protect a lot of people from the virus. It's a joke because they're the government.
64,8,"The EPA is a major source of illness. The whole ""we are just as racist as Donald J. Trump"". It's a joke because it's a government policy issue. But the government is not a monopoly on public health, it's a monopoly on health."

96,8,"Vaccination is a crime. It's a moral issue. It's a crime. It's a crime, but it's not on the table. The NHL is doing exactly what it's supposed to do."
100,8,"As someone who's fought for over 20 years, I can say that the current congress is being extremely irrational and sexist. This was never the case."
8,4,It's a joke because it's a joke.
18,8,"CANNOTANSWER: ""I'm an advocate for this because the federal government is not the one to make up for the fact that the government has an involuntary role in preventing the spread of a virus."""
25,8,I'm an immigrant from the United States and I would like to add to this:
26,8,The wording of this is:
29,8,"Vaccine is not illegal. They want to prevent the spread of a disease. It is not a joke, it is a joke, it is a joke. The ACA is not legal. The CDC has to enforce their mandates when it becomes legal in the US. And there is no way they can get the money for them to do so. And the government is not going to do it."
31,8,Its about the fact that if you are wearing a mask and you're scared of the virus it's not a joke. It's a joke and a joke
33,8,"I don’t get what you mean by it, but the CDC fucked up this article. This is all about how the government is trying to make fun of the government."
35,8,CANNOTANSWER: 'Wooding a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. '
36,8,So... you're a little bit of a racist nut who thinks hats are the best way to protect you from a virus?
41,8,It’s like the entire movie “The Matrix” starring Bill Gates and Bill Gates. It’s literally the best show ever.
47,8,">The ACA repeal is a joke. The CDC is in no position to stop the spread of a virus. There is no prohibition to use vaccinations without authorization. The ACA has already been around a long time. It's now the reason we have the CDC suing the president for the ACA repeal because of the ""I'm not a doctor"" joke. Vaccines are not an effective tool, and they are not as effective as a hat."
49,8,"""I love the whole hat thing, but I don't really like it. I think it's kind of a joke, and the idea of taking care of it should be taken care of."""
53,8,">People are bringing this to their desks. I'm sorry but I'm not really sure what he was thinking. I know that I might have gotten the joke from a source. If there's some logical premise and it's what it is, I'd probably be interested in reading more."""
61,8,"""...The whole ACA is a joke. It has nothing to do with the government. They're trying to make the government more evil than it should be."", ""Is the ACA a joke. It has nothing to do with the government."", ""I just think the ACA is just a joke. They are trying to make the government more evil than it should be."""
63,8,"Vaccines are a joke, but it's a joke."
64,8,"There are a lot of jokes about hats, and the ones about how people wear them aren't a joke, despite their racist tendencies. It's not like they're saying people should fuck the Obama administration if they have a right to fuck the Obama administration. It's like people are going to have to have a morally correct opinion about it, which may or may not be a valid reason for them to cut their liability."
67,8,> [[... I'm not sure if you read the full article. But I have some knowledge about a number of things I learned in my college years when I was in high school. Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of a virus.
78,8,That is pretty bad advice. I would say the only way to be a skunk is to be a skunk. It is the best way to get a skunk.
89,8,Vaccination is not a joke. It is not a joke. It is not a joke.
91,8,>How does the mask make his breath come out of the back of his head?
92,8,"The only thing I can say that makes any of them think it's funny is ""Don't be a dick."" I'm gonna get a little off on this a bit, but that's too much to handle."
96,8,Vaccination is not a crime. It's a crime. It's a crime because the NHL is trying to make it harder to get them to enforce the law.
100,8,TWitchcon was a big part of the anti-vaccination movement.
8,4,">I'm going to say that about twitchcon', 'Vaccine is a serious health issue. The government is trying to make people sick, despite what the article implies.', ""I love the whole hat thing, but I don't really like it. I think it's kind of a joke, and the idea of taking care of it should be taken care of."", ""I love the whole hat thing, but I don't really like it. I think it's kind of joke""."

25,8,CANNOTANSWER:
26,8,"In this context, the ACA is an unpopular opinion in states across the country, and a joke."
29,8,"You have a valid point. It is not a joke that makes it illegal, but it is a joke because the CDC has to enforce mandates when it becomes legal. So it isn't legal."
31,8,"The article clearly says that wearing a mask to prevent the spread of a virus. Because, as the creator of the AMA, it’s full of great examples."
33,8,"I agree with the other posters, but the joke is misleading and silly."
35,8,">I've been looking for a new job lately. Vaccination isn't mandatory, I just have a helmet"
36,8,There is actually an entire thread about that and I'm going to go ahead and tell you the truth about it.
41,8,"You're right that they are doing a great job of promoting anti-virus awareness. They're also going to do it because they don't feel safe. That's a bit fucking crass, but they just don't get to wear one."
47,8,"""If you can't get a vaccinated child, go to the doctor. If you can't get a vaccinated child, go to the doctor."""
49,8,"I don’t know how much of a joke or something is nailed into a ""pasta""."
53,8,It's a joke and it's not about the Obama Amendment.
61,8,Vaccination is a joke.
63,8,It's a joke because it's about the government. They are trying to stop the spread of a virus. It's a joke because the CDC is trying to stop it by putting on a mask.
64,8,"[In the US, the EPA is the main source of disease for the spread of a deadly virus. People who think it's a joke are putting themselves in danger and they don't want to see it."
67,8,"'Anal, but I was told a couple of times about the new skunk law in the US.'"
78,8,"It says: ""I think that this is a joke about the government."""
89,8,The 'Memoir is the joke'? That's one of the funny things I've seen. I'm not saying it's a joke. I just think that 'Memoir' is a joke because I think it's racist.
91,8,They are getting paid. This is why the people are going to come back and get the vaccine. It's a real problem. It's the government trying to prevent it and the NRA is doing things to make it more effective. They are going to find someone to do the same thing with and they don't get paid. Trying to stop it is also a big red flag.
92,8,"It is an excellent response to the ""I wear my mask when i am in public lawmaker who isn't wearing his mask in public says', ""I think I know the name.''"
96,8,A few of the questions here are:
100,8,"If I could take the mask off, would I be able to get on and on with my job? Because I have no insurance so I can get off and on with my job?"
