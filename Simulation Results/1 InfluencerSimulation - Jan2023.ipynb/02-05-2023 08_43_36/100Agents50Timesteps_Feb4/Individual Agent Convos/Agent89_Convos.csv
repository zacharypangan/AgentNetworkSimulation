89,7,You wear your mask in public?
89,8,People are still sore if they wear a mask and don't want to talk about that
89,11,Then they re using a mask to fight off the virus and infected it with other viruses.

89,25,"I have to wear a mask at work, but the problem with this is that I cant breathe in any way."
89,42,It s a viral virus that has spread to a lot of people in the US (and its related to a lot of states) and they are the first to stop it. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
89,49,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

89,59,I think the worst part of this is it s up to each state if you use your own state.
89,72,My mask is a scar of some kind but it keeps me away from a lot of my friends and family. It is the kind of scar that gets the most of my blood. They're soooo smart!
89,75,i have a mask that will keep me from breathing x
89,87,Well they are wearing a mask to help spread it.
93,89,I don't think so. There is also a mask that could help the government stop spread of the virus.

89,6,"This topic should be brought up at any one time or another, right?"
89,7,Are you kidding? It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of the virus.

89,17,"The best way to spread the virus would be to put a face mask on your head with a visor or a mask on your face, then take off the mask and cover your face with a tampon like a frog (if you're looking for it). That way they can't spread it, as it will be easier to hide it in the back of your neck."
89,20,I'd rather not be wearing a mask at work because it would make me feel dirty. I could go to the bathroom because I'd get hot and have to take some medicine. I'd wear something like a mask in public for the rest of my day.
89,25,"I have to wear a mask at work, but the problem with this is that I cant breathe in any way."
89,42,"I'd rather have a face mask compared to the rest of my friends and family, instead of having to wear my own face mask."
89,49,"I would consider a mask of some kind, that I could put on someone else's face. My husband wears it as a way to stop people from feeling so sick, and it protects him from a virus, but the issue isn't that I have a good deal of contact with the sick person in public, it's that I've been trying to prevent it from spreading in public and it's not something I can do."

89,56,"This is the most appropriate answer - there is a better answer for every one of us - and it's really not a question that comes up a lot in this thread. I think you have to take a deep breath and rethink how you re going to do it, and what the implications are for all of us."
89,59,"This is a topic that should be brought up at any one time or another, right?"
89,72,"It's a big deal and the government doesn't want to put a mask on, and it's too difficult to control."

89,59,Do you really like being with the doctor? It would be a good idea if he could make someone who has had a mask go through some sort of antiviral medication.
89,72,"It is the newest strain of the virus, that's not the problem at all. It is not infected, and it has no potential to spread."
89,75,A tampon is a good way to prevent infection and prevent infection in people with the virus. That's why you wear a mask.
89,87,Why would you want to be in a medical emergency and wear a mask? If you want to help a sick person then wear a mask.
93,89,>They are just as sexist as Donald J. Trump was. Why do you think this would be a good idea?
99,89,I've got a question. What is the big deal?
89,6,It's pretty obvious that a mask can help prevent some kind of sickness but it's a good idea to use it at all times.
89,7,"The government isn't going to bring the question to us, not your husband."
89,8,"I think that the person is trying to spread a virus, so there's a good chance that the mask he's wearing could be actually helping with that problem. I can't understand how some people don't understand why people would need a mask. It's like how you wear a tampon as a last resort, but people don't want to go outside to eat."
89,11,"I've heard this before, but that's it. The virus is very contagious so they're wearing a mask that helps to prevent spread and it's not the real problem."
89,17,This sounds like a very interesting and incredibly frank response. This is a lot of shit that could be answered.

89,59,I think it's a good idea.
89,72,You don't have to wear a mask in the first place. That's very sexist.
89,75,"And if the government does that, the person does not get sick unless they wear a mask."
89,87,I'm a little confused as to why a mask would be a good idea. You say it as someone who is a doctor who is going to help someone who is a doctor? Because they know how to help people. The doctor probably feels the same way about you.
93,89,Why do you think the people who are a good Democrat who like to wear masks in public are a bad one?
99,89,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
89,6,A new CDC study indicates that the use of masks is the main cause of sickness. It is not common to wear a mask in public. A person who hasn't been exposed to a virus can get HIV/AIDS.
89,7,There's also a mask that could help the government stop the spread of the virus.
89,8,Because the mask would not be effective against the virus and the virus is not contagious. You're probably being deceived by some of the sexist and sexist nonsense you've read.
89,11,I agree with the OP. This is a good question to ask. How are the people in this thread able to see how much the problem is if you don't want to be in a public place?
89,17,This is what makes America what it is.

89,55,"Yes. People in the US can wear a mask, even with their noses and shoulders down. If it is used on someone for a sick person (and only in their eye sockets), they're ok. And it's not just a mask for the job. You don't need a mask, you have to wear a mask."

89,25,"[Doctor: I think you have to take a deep breath and rethink how you are going to do it, and what the implications are for all of us."
89,42,"My family is currently getting the newest virus, so it's the virus we're talking about. They've gotten a new one that could cause it to spread. If we can't vaccinate them then we should be getting the new one as well. That's why there's so much stigma associated with the vaccine."
89,49,What do you think of what the Obama administration is going to do?
89,55,"I don't see how this is a ""sexist"" thing to do. It is a question of ""How can we help?"
89,56,"The problem is that the current government isn't working with people that want to help them, and they aren't taking it seriously. They are trying to use it to prevent health care expenses. It's not just a matter of what their job is."""
89,59,The problem lies with how we treat people and how we deal with the effects.

89,75,"I would like to see someone who is not in favor of the mask, who isn't allowed to wear the mask, take a deep breath and rethink how you are going to do it."
89,87,"Well, the one problem with that quote is that they can't do it. And, no, they can't do it. If you don't want to do it, you can't do it."
93,89,"I think you mean if you want to be a republican, you just need to be a republican."
99,89,"There is no right or wrong answer to these things, but it's not the point of a joke to make a joke about vaccines, it's the point of a joke."
89,6,Vaccination is a problem. It's not a health insurance or health insurance policy.
89,7,"I've written about a lot of people doing what they are supposed to do and being ""sexist"" tbh."
89,8,"It is sexist and racist to make fun of the government's actions. I've never seen the mask, but I do like to wear it."
89,11,"> They are using the mask to stop spread and it's not the real problem."""
89,17,He sounds like a liberal who thinks it is racist.
89,20,There is no sexist way to spread the virus.
89,25,It's a joke. It's a joke.
89,42,Vaccines do not have any value for health and its stigma is a big part of that. It will not be tolerated at all in the U.S. in the future.
89,49,"I just said I'm a nutjob in a nutjob, I’m just so unhelpful."
89,55,"People who wear a mask in public to help spread HIV/AIDS are in fact infected with the virus. If they don't wear it, then they're ok."
89,56,"Then you have to explain a little bit to me the meaning of ""The mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
89,59,> I am not a big fan of Obamacare.
89,72,I'm not sure who else's thinking this. It isn't as if a mask isn't part of the healthcare industry.

89,11,Vaccines have been widely used for a long time. That's why they're used as an endemic vaccine. It doesn't necessarily prevent that. It is a bad thing.
89,17,The issue isn't'shit' but whether or not you think that's the point of the joke. I think you need to clarify how you think.
89,20,"This comment made me think, ""I don't like to wear a mask at work because it would make me feel dirty. I could go to the bathroom because I'd get hot and have to take some medicine. I'd wear something like a mask in public for the rest of my day."""
89,25,I'm a liberal. I don't like the government's policy on vaccinating. And I don't like the government's policy on using it at work. It's my opinion that he does not like it unless it's being used against him. It's a nutjob joke.
89,42,"And the aforementioned sexist comment about 'The mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. Well, the one problem with that quote is that they can't do it. And, no, they can't do it. If you don't want to do it, you can't do it."
89,49,I don't really understand how a man would be if he didn't wear a mask for HIV. It's a joke.

89,56,"Vaccination is an anti-virus. I've never heard of it and it's the only treatment in my life that doesn't prevent HIV/AIDS. I have also read it and found it very helpful. I want to see it, but I'm afraid there are only a handful of people that can afford it, and haven't seen a patient who has been infected with it. That's something I don't want to know about. I've read this story before but it's nothing that I've ever heard of the government, including a doctor"
89,59,"Vaccination is not an insurance issue. It is a health issue. If it is not accepted, it doesn't have to be a policy. If it isn't, it's not a medical issue."
89,72,"I was thinking the same thing. My mom says that while they do have to wear a mask, it's the only way to spread the virus in their head. But that's just the mask."

89,87,This isn't a joke.
93,89,No way. It's the first of many jokes about the government. There's no way to stop it. It's a 'compelling' joke. If you like to be a republican you need to be a republican.
99,89,"It's a joke, and a petty joke isn't."
89,6,"Vaccines are a serious health issue, not a problem. If you're being facetious, you're making a joke."

89,17,I don't think that a mask is going to stop the spread of a virus. I think a mask would be enough to prevent some of the symptoms. So I'd say you are very much in the minority here because of the lack of awareness of a virus and your point of view.
89,20,"""I want to be a conservative, but I'm not a republican, but this isn't a joke."""

89,42,What's a joke?
89,49,"You're being facetious, you're making a joke."
89,55,I would have sex with a woman who wore a mask in public. I would feel dirty. I would feel dirty too. I would feel dirty. And that would be a medical emergency. I'd say I don't know how to handle a man who's wearing a mask is a man. I just don't know how to carry a man. I don't know how to do anything for myself.
89,56,"Vaccination is an anti-virus. It is not an insurance issue. It is a health issue. If you don't want to do it, you can't. If you don't want to do it, you can't. It's a nutjob joke."
89,59,"""We are not in control of this shit."""
89,72,No. This isn't a joke.
89,75,There are a few things I don't understand:
89,87,Vaccination isn't an insurance issue. It's a health issue. It's the first of many jokes about the government. There's no way to stop it.
93,89,"It's a funny, funny joke. It's a real shame he could lose a party to a super sexist joke, because it is the worst one of those things."
99,89,The problem isn't whether it's the media or the government's fault. Vaccination isn't required by the government.
89,6,"> Vaccines are a serious health issue, not a problem."
89,7,They could stop it in their heads by going into their lungs while in the bathroom.
89,8,"If the government is going to go after you, they will go after the dreadful ol', old, racist racists. If the government is going after you, they will go after you. If the government doesn't come after you, then the government will go after you."
89,11,"That's not a joke, but it is a joke. This is a serious health issue, not a real problem. The problem isn't whether it's the government or the media's fault. Vaccination isn't required by the government."
89,17,It's a joke that's a joke to make fun of. It's a joke to make fun of.
89,20,"It’s an interesting fact, not a joke. It’s a joke. It’s a joke. It’s a joke."
89,25,It's a joke to the point of a joke to a joke.
89,42,"The people who use the term ""vaccination"" are being sexist and racist. Vaccines are a serious health issue. It's not a health issue."
89,49,"This is a joke. It’s a joke, and it’s a joke. It’s a joke. It’s a joke."
89,55,"This isn't a joke, it's just one joke. It's a joke."
89,56,"I'm not sure why he's downvoting, but I know this is not an easy one to figure out - it was one of the jokes."
89,59,It's a nutjob joke.
89,72,"It's been said before, but it seems that the idea of a mask in the public eye is not a joke, but a legitimate one."
89,75,I would say I'm very much in the minority here because of the lack of awareness of a virus and my point of view.
89,87,"If they didn't do it, that's an illegal job."
93,89,People who can't make the jokes that they tell are nutjobs.
99,89,This is a great question to ask me.
89,6,"It's not a serious health issue, not a problem."
89,7,I know this isn't a joke but it's a legitimate joke. There is no danger in the absence of a health emergency. If you can't stop a virus in your body then you should not be in the situation of an epidemic.
89,8,"""The idea of a mask in the public eye is not a joke. It's a joke. It’s an interesting fact, not a joke."
89,11,"The government isn't required by the government, not the government."
89,17,"The point is, if you think we should go after the people who knowingly do something, and a bit more than that you are ignorant and ignorant."
89,20,It's a joke. It's not a joke. It's a joke.
89,25,This is one of the biggest nutjob jokes on Reddit.
89,42,"I'm not a big fan of the notion of a mask being a joke, but I'm just glad that it's being used in a nutjob way."
89,49,"I'm sorry, but I’m just hoping it will be better for me."
89,55,I've been wearing a mask in the past and it's one of the worst jokes I've ever heard. I don't like it. I don't like it. But it's one of the sexist jokes that I think is very funny. Vaccination is not an insurance issue. Vaccination isn't an insurance issue. It's a health issue. It's the first of many jokes about the government. There's no way to stop it. It's a joke.
89,56,[Drug use isn't a joke.
89,59,Is it because of that he is not aware of the problem?
89,72,I don't think he understood that there is an issue with vaccination and he did not. It sounds a little weird but I think he really doesn't have a problem with the government allowing it.
89,75,"Vaccines are a serious health issue, but they aren't required by the government."
89,87,"There's no need for a ""no"". A mask is only good for a job. The problem isn't if they don't go after you and then get fired, but if you don't do it they're making the government a little bit harder."
93,89,You don't have to be a conservative to have a joke. You don't have to be a republican to wear a mask in public unless you have a mask on.
99,89,I think it's a good question to ask.
89,6,"I grew up in a country where they use masks. I went to a place where they used them to help protect people in cases where people had HIV/AIDS. I had a mask on when I went to work, and a few days later I noticed that there was an outbreak. When I was younger my mother had that problem too. So I did it for a long time."
89,7,"Vaccination isn't a joke. It's an interesting fact, not a joke. The idea of a mask in the public eye isn't a joke. It’s an interesting fact, not a joke. The government isn't required by the government. There is no need for a ""no"". The point is, if you think we should go after the people who knowingly do something, and then get fired, but if you don't do it they're making the government a little bit harder."
89,8,Because in many places they are very different from the people you can see on the street. There's really nothing to like about it. A few people do like wearing masks and I'd be surprised if that's the only way I could get it on my face. It's a joke.
89,11,"I don't see how there is any joke in there. I think it is a good question, but I also don't like the idea of being told how a mask could stop spread of the virus. The government isn't required by the government, not the government. The government isn't required by the government. The point is, if you think we should go after the people who knowingly do something, and then get fired, but if you don't do it they're making the government a little bit harder."
89,17,It's a nutjob joke.
89,20,It’s a joke. It’s a joke.
89,25,"I'm so glad this is being used in a joke way, because I'm a liberal and a good part of the healthcare industry."
89,42,The only way to be a good Democrat is if I can afford one.
89,49,It's all jokes and a lot of other jokes.
89,55,"I'm not a big fan of a joke, but I’m just glad it's being used in a funny way. I don’t think it’s a joke, but it’s a joke."
89,56,"That's the one thing I would rather not know about the government. It doesn't seem to be really a joke to me. You know what's a joke, but it's something I'm familiar with."
89,59,"> The problem isn't if they don't go after you and then get fired, but if you don't do it they're making the government a little bit harder."
89,72,"I'm a Republican, a conservative, a conservative, and a Republican. I think this is an important issue."
89,75,"I'm not a conservative, but it is ridiculous that a nutjob joke is a joke."
89,87,I have a mask on right now. The only thing i can see are the comments i'm making about a mask
93,89,"This is not a joke, it's an argument about the use of the word ""nutjob"" to make political shit."
99,89,"Vaccination is not mandatory by the government. Vaccination isn't mandatory by the government, and is illegal."
89,6,"If you’re a doctor and you can wear a mask, there isn’t much that the government can do about it."
89,7,"You know what's a joke, but it’s a joke. That’s not the point of a joke, and a joke is not what it's intended to be. It’s not a joke. That’s a joke, but it’s not an actual fact, not a joke."
89,8,"Vaccination is not mandatory by the government. It isn't mandated by the government. There is no need for a ""no""."
89,11,Because it's not a joke. The joke is an argument about the government not getting behind a falsehood.
89,17,"""This is what makes America what it is. I'm not sure if the people who are against it and are against it."""
89,20,"No, not a joke. No, no, no. No, no, no. The only way to be a good Republican is if I can afford one. I don’t think I’m a Republican, but it’s an important issue."
89,25,"'...but a person can be a doctor if they want. That's a big deal."""
89,42,"As long as you're not having sex with your family, you're being a nutjob."
89,49,"I am just saying I’m afraid I will probably leave. But if you know what I mean, I can understand why the word ’m joke’ is a joke."
89,55,I'm afraid you're talking about a number of things.
89,56,">Then you have to explain a little bit to me the meaning of ""The mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
89,59,I'm not a conservative but the people defending 'the idea' have been very well served by the current government.
89,72,"Why can't you just ignore the fact that there's not a virus that could spread unless it's infected? It's no longer a joke and they have to comply with the laws. This is not a joke, it's a nutjob joke, and it's a joke."
89,75,"Vaccination isn't a joke. It's an interesting fact, not a joke. A mask is only good for a job."
89,87,"People don't just say ""no"" or ""no"" for medical reason, it's also a joke because you're assuming there isn't a reason why you don't think you can wear a mask in public and don't understand why people do. So basically the opposite - everyone who says they can't afford a mask and wants to wear a mask has a problem."
93,89,"The first one was really about the role of social media in supporting and exposing the President, not a generality, but about a joke that ""[Mrs. Trump] is a good candidate if he's not in the political party."""
99,89,"I don't understand what you mean by petty joke. I don't understand the context of why the government is mandated to get people to be vaccinated. Vaccination is a medical necessity, it entails getting vaccinated."
89,6,I don't think you understand what I mean. I think Vaccination is a serious health issue and it should not be a joke.
89,7,And I don't think it's a joke. The president is a hypocrite.
89,8,"As an ex-Muslim, I would say that the government has to do something about it. I don't think people who like to wear a mask in public are a bad idea."
89,11,"The mask is a good idea because I don't understand why people think it's a joke, and I don't see how people can accept the joke without being prompted."
89,17,"I think it's a really good joke to ask, because it's a joke and not the point of the joke, because it's a very common joke."
89,20,"I think I was going to mention it because I think it's a joke, but I was trying to put some perspective on it and maybe I was just misreading what you're saying."
89,25,I’m just saying I’m a nutjob. The only way to be a good Republican is if I can afford one.
89,42,I think the other issue here is that the people who are a nutjob and want to be a nutjob are being sexist and racist. Vaccination is a serious health issue. It's not a health issue.
89,49,"It's not a joke. It's an interesting fact, not a joke."
89,55,I didn't think it was a joke that this was about Obama in 2012...
89,56,"Vaccination is not a joke. It’s an interesting fact, not a joke. It’s not a joke. It’s not a joke."
89,59,I think you're making a valid point.
89,72,A nutjob joke isn't a joke. A joke is a nutjob joke that has been used as a joke.
89,75,"Well, if you think they are being racist or sexist, it isn't a joke because it a joke based on the government's inaction in the past, which isn't really a good reason, because they are being racist."
89,87,"A lot of people arguing for a mask in the first place is ""that's a petty joke""."
93,89,"I think the ""smoking nutjob"" joke is a good one to have in the political world and in the news a lot of people don't really like it, and it's not funny. It's a joke that's about the Obama presidency, but it's really just a joke about the administration."
99,89,I'm a big anti-vaccine advocate. But I think the government is just trying to make a joke.
89,6,"> Vaccination is a serious health issue. It's a serious health issue, not a problem."
89,7,I don't know what a nutjob joke is. I'm more of a nutjob.
89,8,This isn't about a joke.
89,11,"Is that the current plan by the Obama administration? If so, what is the point of the plan?"
89,17,"In some ways it doesn't make sense to joke about this situation. I think the first is the reason we're assuming ""I have no doubt"" that the government wants to help with the spread of the disease, and if I could be the only person to think of something so funny and interesting."
89,20,"I can’t imagine how we would react if we were on the same page, and I would not have the guts or the guts to keep talking like that. I would also look for a way to tell them how it would affect everyone."
89,25,"'Doctor: I think you have to take a deep breath and rethink how you are going to do it, and what the implications are for all of us.'"
89,42,"The issue here is that the government is making a joke. If it makes a joke about the government, it’s not going to be a joke."
89,49,"He's a joke, but he's not a joke. This is a joke about Obama's administration. You're saying he's a joke, y'know?"
89,55,I think you're being sarcastic.
89,56,"I can't believe a doctor that is so adamant that you think it's a joke. It was the first time I heard it, and you've gotta say it's a joke."
89,59,"So this isn't about the vcm/hippy vv vm debate that came up with it. And I've been wondering why people say ""I'd rather not be in a medical emergency than go to a doctor"" or ""I would rather go to a doctor"" or ""I'd rather be in a medical emergency than get a patient in an ambulance or whatever"" instead of ""Why are you going to go to the doctor to get checked out unless you're in public?"""
89,72,"Vaccination is a serious health issue. It's not a joke, but it has to be done."
89,75,"Yes, I'm a big anti-vaccine advocate, but I don't think that's what it means, because that's just the way I get it."
89,87,The only problem with that quote is that they can't do it.
93,89,"I don't like the joke, but if you do like the joke I think it should be about the administration, not the presidential candidates. The president is in a position to go down as a moderate, and a liberal can't go up against the nutty nutty nutty nutjob if he doesn't have the nerve to change his mind."
99,89,It's a joke if it's not being stooping to the agenda of a large corporation.
89,6,"Vaccines are not a serious health issue, and a serious health issue. There's just nothing to do about it."
89,7,"I think he's a nutjob, and doesn't understand the distinction between humor and a joke."
89,8,My best guess is that the first person to say this is a guy who wears a mask? Is he a liberal? Is it a woman who likes to wear a mask in the public eye?
89,11,"Vaccination is a serious health issue. It's not a joke, but it has to be done. The issue here is that the government is making a joke."
89,17,I'm really curious what he is trying to say.
89,20,"In a more extreme nutjob sort of way, the whole 'advice' thing is a joke about how they aren't allowed to use a mask. A public health professional would be able to find some information on it and make it more interesting and relevant to the general public."
89,25,"Vaccination is a serious health issue. It's not a joke, but it has to be done."
89,42,"A nutjob joke, and a joke about a nutjob being racist, and the same thing about the government."
89,49,That one really was not a joke. The joke was about the people that were trying to stop HIV from spreading. There was some discussion about why it was a joke.
89,55,"So the president is a joke, isn't he?"
89,56,"I don't like my doctors, I just want to see a good doctor. And I don't want to see a bad doctor."
89,59,"So it's not a joke that people get sick, because they get to go to the doctor, because they want to. This isn't about the government making a joke about it."
89,72,"Vaccination is a serious health issue. It's not a joke, but it has to be done."
89,75,"I'm a little of a nutjob, but I'm a Republican and the problem isn't the mask."
89,87,"I don't know what that means, but a mask should be for a purpose. This is a joke and the government is making it."
93,89,There's only one reason why I hate the Republican party.
99,89,I don't know about that. I can only hope that some people get vaccines for an illness that they won't get in a hospital if they are afraid to do it.
89,6,"As a Republican, I'm very impressed by this article."
89,7,Isn't the joke about not going to a doctor? I think that would be a great way to make your health care situation better.
89,8,"The President does not need a mask, he's a nutjob."
89,11,I'm not a political commenter. I am more of a person who believes that the government is blaming the health system.
89,17,"Vaccination is a serious health issue. It's not a joke, but it has to be done."
89,20,"In a way that doesn't make me angry, I am only doing it to hurt someone in a way that they don't like."
89,25,"""Hey, it is a joke, I don't think it's a joke."""
89,42,People who want to get vaccines are not going to be able to afford one. The fact is that a lot of them want to be able to afford to get one.
89,49,I’m a little of a Republican but I’m not sure if you understand what I’m saying or what it means.
89,55,A Republican senator is a joke.
89,56,"I love when people say something like ""you are wearing a mask to help spread the virus. I don't like to wear a mask in public. I think it's kind of offensive that they're saying this, but I don't think it's that stupid."
89,59,"Vaccination is not a joke. It's a serious health issue. It's not a joke, but it needs to be done."
89,72,"The people who wear a mask should have a good reason to do so, because of the seriousness of their health issues. The people who have a mask should have an objective view of how to prevent the spread of HIV."
89,75,"Vaccination is a serious health issue, and it's not required by the government. It's not a joke, and it's a joke. It's an interesting fact, not a joke. A mask is only good for a job, and if there is no need to wear a mask in public, this is going to be the problem."
89,87,The last comment –?> ah the best of the best.
93,89,"As a former Republican who's been in the political arena for two years, I can tell you that ""Nuff said"" is about the president's life. It's a joke that's about the US and what he does in life."
99,89,I'm gonna give you a quick quote. The problem isn't whether it's the media or the government's fault. Vaccination isn't mandatory by the government. They are trying to make it illegal.
89,6,“Vaccines are not a serious health issue. It’s not a serious health issue. Vaccination is not a serious health issue. They aren’t required by the government. They are trying to make it illegal.”
89,7,The joke doesn't matter. The joke does matter. And a nutjob is a joke.
89,8,Vaccination is a serious health issue. It's not a joke. It's a serious health issue. It's not mandatory by the government. It's not mandatory by the government. It's not mandatory by the government.
89,11,"It's not a joke. The issue isn't the government, it's the public."
89,17,So you have no idea what the government is doing?... I don't know what the Obama administration is doing.
89,20,"Vaccination is a serious health issue. It's not a joke, and it's not mandatory by the government. They are trying to make it illegal."
89,25,"I think people like the idea of the mask. I don't like it, and I don't like it, but I do want to wear it."
89,42,I think it's funny that a man who has a mask in his mouth to prevent viral infections to people who have already received one is also wearing a mask to help prevent infection to people who haven't already received the other.
89,49,The Obama administration is trying to make a joke about a serious health issue. This is a joke about the President. He's not a joke. He's a joke about the government. The government is trying to make it illegal.
89,55,Vaccination is a serious health issue. Vaccination is not a joke. It's not mandatory by the government. They are trying to make it illegal.
89,56,"What do you mean ""the newest strain is sooo contagious just bc they have a mask on their hands pics don't mean they re using it""?"
89,59,"That's kind of an amazing line, really."
89,72,The government is trying to make a joke out of it.
89,75,"> 'Well, if I think they are being racist or sexist, it isn't a joke."
89,87,I don't think I have a bad point about it. But I agree that I'm a big fan of a mask that I can wear in public. I don't think anyone likes it so I think I'm being an asshole. I know it's not a joke but I don't think it's one of those things that people just say in their head. The truth is that it's an unfortunate thing.
93,89,a lot of people who've been in the political arena:
99,89,I got a joke on here a few months back about an incident involving a friend he wore a mask with a doctor.
89,6,I think the government is trying to make it illegal.
89,7,They should make an effort to protect people from infections if they can't stop them if they are in an emergency if they don't stop the spread of a virus.
89,8,"It seems like someone hasn't reacted well to the quote in the first place, despite the fact that there is still a good chance it might be valid."

89,17,"It's not a joke, it's a joke."
89,20,"I'm not sure where to go from there, but it sounds like a joke."
89,25,It's not a joke.
89,42,"And the last comment is about Obama. Not just a guy who is in politics. But he is running for president. So it's a joke, not a joke."
89,49,People who are not on board with the Obama administration have more than the right to wear a mask because of the lack of respect for them.
89,55,"I mean, that guy is pretty sick of that! It doesn't even bother me. He's sick of it. He's infected. He's not a doctor. He's a politician."
89,56,Vaccination is an anti-virus. It's not an insurance issue. It’s not a joke. It’s not a serious health issue. Vaccination is not a serious health issue. It’s not a serious health issue.
89,59,It's a joke that isn't actually being made. I'm just telling you that people who don't understand the value of the government as a system that is trying to make it illegal are making the most logical and rational decisions in the world.
89,72,"Vaccination is an important health issue. It's not a joke, but it has to be done."
89,75,Vaccination isn't a joke. It's a serious health issue. Vaccination isn't required by the government. They are trying to make it illegal.
89,87,I think it's an unfortunate thing.

You don't have to say it to be funny, and the next person you've spoken to is just saying that, and it's a joke, and you're not. This is an important conversation topic for any one time. It's a joke.

89,25,"I've always sat on a blackboard to show how conservative the Democratic party is and how they support their agenda in the form of bigotry, and I couldn't agree more. But my point was that it's a joke and I think it's a real one. It doesn't matter if someone has the right to wear a mask at work but if the government wants to stop the spread of a virus that should make the issue worse. But in the meantime, I think people need to find a way to use a mask in public and"
89,42,I can't believe the sheer amount of ridicule and misogyny they're making about the government as an ad hominem.

89,87,"Yes, I think the whole idea of a mask as an anti-virus is a joke, and the fact that people are going to wear it to help spread it has nothing to do with the idea that it is necessary for everyone to have it, and it is a joke."
93,89,"As someone who was in a presidential office for years, I would find your comment very offensive."
99,89,"I've had a lot of narcissism recently. I thought this was more a rape joke than a joke. I've had some good conversations with people who have had sex with their bf and have some really fun, I can't stand having sex with people with a mask. The joke is a joke, not a joke. The idea of using the word ""silly"" to smear the government is one of the most stupid and stupid things you've ever heard."

93,89,"I'd make a joke about this joke about a politician who doesn't wear a mask, but isn't in the presidential race."
99,89,Is it illegal to smear the government? It's not. You don't make a joke unless you are going to get a vaccine?

89,25,"I know what you mean. The jokes about the people who are actually on the issue are ridiculous. I can't imagine a doctor who can't wear a mask on a regular basis.

89,56,So what's the most appropriate answer for this question?
89,59,"I know this is a big post, but I was really a bit worried because I didn't know it was a joke, but I was afraid for my health. My doctor told me a few times that a vaccinating mask would be a good idea because it might help stop the spread of the disease. I got my doctor's help and that it was a nice way to help prevent HIV/ AIDS. He also told me to get a blood test.

99,89,Vaccination is an important medical necessity. It is not mandatory. But it is the minimum requirement for a doctor's job to do so.
89,6,In a nutshell. But the government doesn't make it illegal or something like that.
89,7,I believe it's because the Obama administration is trying to make a joke about health care. It's being sexist and racist.

89,72,"I don't think the joke is about being a racist. It's about being able to look at people in public without being able to understand them, and not a joke about the government."

93,89,"This is a good place to post this, because when people say 'The government is a joke', it means the president is a joke."

89,7,"In the US, people don't wear masks when they're in an emergency and aren't HIV carriers. There is no vaccine to stop HIV from spreading. There is no vaccine to stop it from spreading."

89,17,"So you said ""I'm not sure if the people who are against it and are against it."", ""'He sounds like a liberal who thinks it is racist.'"""
89,20,This is a good place to put the question. I believe it's because the Obama administration is trying to make a joke about health care.

89,7,"I'm not trying to sway you but to put that one in context, the president is a nutjob and I don't think a joke about the president or the country should even bother with it, and I think it is a funny joke."

99,89,"The first is a petty joke. Especially when it's a ""celebration"" joke. If the government doesn't want people to have vaccines a doctor will slap them in the face."
89,6,Because this is a joke. It's not a joke.
89,7,They want the president to be a nutjob and they want to pay for it. But the president is just as stupid because it is a joke.
89,8,I've done nothing about it.
89,11,"""The only way to be a good Democrat is if I can afford one. It's not a serious health issue. It's not a serious health issue. It’s not a serious health issue. It’s not a serious health issue. It’s not a serious health issue. It’s not a serious health issue."
89,17,"The problem with this isn't how the government is treating it, it is how it's treating it in a way that doesn't hurt people. The fact that it's so funny is part of the reason why there's a lot of people defending it that you can't stop being a nutjob."
89,20,"Vaccination is an important health issue. It’s not a joke. It’s not a joke, because it’s not an issue."
89,25,"I don't know if this is a joke, or just a joke about the government. This is really a joke about the government. I'm a liberal, and I think this is a joke about the people who aren't on the front page, including you."
89,42,"'It's a nutjob joke, but I don't think it's racist '"
89,49,There isn't a joke about this...
89,55,I like the way you think.
89,56,It’s a joke about the government. It’s not an insurance issue. It’s not a serious health issue.
89,59,"The joke isn't about a government problem. It's about it. You need to get rid of this shit, as the whole reason to not be a nutjob joke is because the government is a nutjob."
89,72,"I am a Republican and it seems like the nutjob joke is about the President, but i think it's about the government. What you are saying isn't really a joke."
89,75,I don't understand what you're saying.
89,87,"Well, my favorite joke for this subreddit is, ""The guy said a mask and was a joke...."" and I gotta say, I don't think he's a joke."
93,89,"I have no idea what you're referring to. It was a joke, that was a joke, it's a joke, that was a joke. It's a joke, it's a joke because it's wrong. It's a joke because it's wrong. It's a joke because it's wrong."
99,89,"Vaccination is a legitimate medical necessity, but it is also part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
89,6,I believe it's a joke that a few people on here didn't realize the medical implications of their own experience. Vaccines are not a serious health issue if a person doesn't have access to it. I'm not suggesting that the fact that you didn't take a deep breath while you went to your doctor clinic is a joke.
89,7,"The president is a nutjob, but they are making the joke about health care that’s about him. The president is a nutjob, but he is being a nutjob."
89,8,"There's also a lot of sexist jokes about it on this sub, but that's just a common word."
89,11,And it's an issue of what it is and is not about that.
89,17,"So, I'm saying that this is the type of joke that makes the whole thing a joke because it has to be said, but then he's gonna get fired because he's actually a nutjob, and this is not a joke about the president."
89,20,"You have a lot of things going on, and a lot of things to talk about."
89,25,"People are sick, the government is smearing the health and safety of the public, and people are not making fun of it. The government is trying to make it illegal."
89,42,What’s not racist is what is actually the point of the joke.
89,49,This is why they make fun of the government.
89,55,The first line in this thread is pretty interesting.
89,56,"So I think the question is, is a doctor wearing a mask to prevent a virus from spreading?"
89,59,>““What’s the point of wearing a mask for a medical emergency”>
89,72,"Well, because this is a joke and is a joke and is not a joke, and is a joke that's about the government, and is a joke about the health issues of the people defending it. I would disagree."
89,75,"If you are really into this nutjob joke then I would definitely give it a shot - but in my opinion, the joke is the only way to take it out of context."
89,87,"I don't really think this is a joke. It's a joke. A joke about the government isn't just a joke, it's a joke about a nutjob."
93,89,What the fuck did you say?

89,6,"A woman who sat in the CDC report of a man with an illness of the neck has been diagnosed with AIDS. She has been diagnosed with HIV in the past ten years. The report said this was ""just a joke and a joke."""
89,7,"It's a joke about the government. You don't get to say something'so much as a joke' because you're referring to a joke about the president, but you do..."
89,8,"The government wants to have the health system that stops sexism, but it can't."
89,11,>There is also a mask that could help the government stop spread of the virus.
89,17,"It's a joke that the president was trying to bring to light a serious issue that a lot of people on here aren't aware of, and he thinks he's wrong."
89,20,They want to do it so that people don’t get sick if they’re wearing masks in public. They want to prevent that by telling people that they can’t be vaccinated with the new virus.
89,25,"That’s very true. Vaccination is not a joke. It’s a joke. The problem is the joke, but it is an issue. People are sick, the government is smearing the health and safety of the public, and people are not making fun of it."
89,42,"I am a political science major in the United States, and I'm trying to understand the idea of it a little better - to get people to learn how to be fluent in fluoride and /or get vaccinated."
89,49,"So what? Vaccines don't prevent the spread of the virus, but you just get it because you don't want to risk infection? If there is a problem in the public, then you just don't want to."
89,55,"I mean, they're both sexist. Is the whole joke about the health issue really about the government?"
89,56,It's actually pretty funny.
89,59,"You're asking for an interesting point. You don't seem to understand the point you're making. It's a joke that's a joke. It's not a joke because it's wrong, and it's a joke because it's wrong. It's a joke because it's wrong."
89,72,"This is the kind of thing that makes me laugh. I think that the president is being a nutjob, but that he needs to take responsibility for putting on a mask on the face, so that he can see the face on his face while he goes to the doctor. That's a joke, a joke and a joke."
89,75,I'm a huge pro-vaccine advocate.
89,87,"I'd think that this is a joke. But I think it's a joke about it being a joke about being a nutjob, and that the government is trying to make it illegal."
93,89,"The thing that makes this a good joke is that ""I think it's a joke because it's wrong. It's a joke because it's wrong. It's a joke because it's wrong. It's a joke because it's wrong."""
99,89,There's a difference between petty and illegal. And a petty joke is when a joke is a joke and an illegal joke is a joke.
89,6,"Vaccines are a serious health issue, but it isn't a serious health issue. There is absolutely nothing to do about it."
89,7,"I've written about a lot of people doing what they are supposed to do and being ""sexist"" tbh."
89,8,That's a joke. I think it's racist that the president wears it.
89,11,Vaccination is a serious health issue. It is a serious health issue. It’s not a serious health issue. It’s not a serious health issue. The government is trying to make it illegal.
89,17,>I think it's a joke because it's a joke
89,20,"The fact that it's not a joke because it's illegal is a big red flag that Republicans aren't making a big deal about it. If you have a real fight on the Internet about this, you need to get an AMA from someone who has been told the AIDS epidemic isn't a joke and they're blaming it on the government."
89,25,The government is not in charge of vaccines.

89,49,I'd say it's a joke because it's a joke. A joke because people need to be vaccinated?
89,55,I think a good joke is the only one that works. It's just not a joke. The joke is just a joke.
89,56,"No, it's not a joke, but a joke if you are interested in being part of the government and doing it."
89,59,I don't think the entire point of the hiveminds statement is really that you're asking for a question that isn't about the government making it illegal.
