    "I'm not a doctor and I'm not a doctor but if I were I would probably be vaccinated (and not risked being infected if I had a rash) because I would not be able to get up to participate in the event (e.g. if a patient is getting a vaccine), or in the event I am at the same age as the person and not have a mask.",
    "This was posted in /r/advice in the early 2000s. It's just a bunch of people expressing dismay that they don't need to get their face tattooed. There are a couple of articles by other vaccinators that are quite similar to this and were used in my experience to do so.",

    "Vaccination is illegal, and it's not enforceable.",
    "The only time I saw any anti-vaccine articles on this sub were from people who said it was \"not a big deal\"... I think the point was that they were telling the people that are trying to change the law, not the people that are trying to do it.",
    "It doesn't seem like there is a need for a mask for TX, but we just do it - it's a matter of time before I'm even allowed to go to TX and it is a part of a federal mandate.",

    "Vaccination is a mandate.",
    "I don't think it's really illegal to wear a mask at a show in Texas, I do think it is a good idea to be a vaccinated person if they can get vaccines or not. If I was in Texas I would get a vaccine.",
    "I know people here who voted for the government to sabotage the twitchcon ban, but they don't live in Texas. The problem is the government has been trying to sabotage it for years. In addition, the CDC's attempts to make it enforceable are all on its side.",

    "Vaccination is a mandate for Texas. The question is whether it is legal for the government to enforce it.",
    "What's that? I'm a federal vaccinator who lived in Texas. I have a mask for the twitchcon. The only thing I've heard of the ACA is that it's a gov't mandate for vaccinating people.",

    "I've heard this from so many people. It's crazy that people are not seeing a difference between wearing a mask and not having a mask to avoid going there with the CDC. I'd imagine that being a part of the ACA doesn't help with the lack of people getting vaccinated. Is it just a problem for the CDC, or a health issue, or what?",
    "It would be a problem for the CDC to force you to wear a mask at a show in TX, so the issue is whether they can enforce the mandate.",
