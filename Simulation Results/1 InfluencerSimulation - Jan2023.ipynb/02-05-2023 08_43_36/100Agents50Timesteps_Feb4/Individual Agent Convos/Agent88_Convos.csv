88,87,'A lot of people don't realize the meaning of the word'snarky' is what a joke means. They're looking for a way to make a point about 'I think it's funny because some people don't understand what a joke is' and 'I think it's better for them to wear it at all when there is a virus.''

88,87,"OP: This seems like a little bit of a troll, sarcasm."

88,87,"I'm not a doctor, but I know what I mean."
