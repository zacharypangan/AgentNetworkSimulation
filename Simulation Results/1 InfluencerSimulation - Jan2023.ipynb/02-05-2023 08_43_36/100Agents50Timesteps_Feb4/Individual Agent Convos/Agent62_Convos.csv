94,62,"oh ok, a few things for now"
95,62,"The way I see it is that when we wear a mask, we look like we're out there talking if the virus spreads."
65,62,"I’m not going to agree with the rest of your comment, but I think wearing a mask to stop the spread of a virus is absolutely useless. I think you need to think about how we’ll stop a virus if we don’t wear a mask."

73,62,They were just trying to force the person to wear a mask.

65,62,"There's also a reason that most of the health care system in the US has the power to prevent disease spread, such as to prevent the spread of the disease. You want to think about the issue, if you have a sense of humor, as I do."

73,62,"They were just trying to force the person to wear a mask. They have to pay for their masks. They will cost them money, and the cost of the mask is based on who wears them, and not who isn't. You don't have to wear a mask to keep them away. This isn't a joke. This isn't an issue. Is the idea of wearing a mask for the purpose of saving the economy really that simple? I think the EPA is using this as a tool to thwart the development of their own legislation"
85,62,Afraid of the person who is saying 'We are a nation of our own.'
94,62,People are supposed to think that these masks stop the spread of any type of illness and stop the spread of a virus. I've found it very helpful for identifying individuals with HIV. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to help stop the spread of a virus. It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
95,62,I read the title from a text book and I got like one shit-up-on-textbook a few years ago... I was really shocked when it came out! I couldn't really imagine how different I would have to be if the idea was that I was in the car but my boyfriend had a rat in his car that we'd keep looking at when we were on a road trip. He wanted to see if the road was a road trip and I wasn't convinced we were being a rat in the middle of the highway. We didn't
65,62,I want to thank you for your comment.
71,62,"I know this, I didn't know this existed in Georgia."
73,62,"i think it is a very complex issue and i think you could just start with something like ""i'm going to get a new mask for a certain job"" (I'm an adult)"
85,62,"In a video where people make a joke about having to go to the movies without wearing a mask, the article also shows how the hat is a sign that the government is invading a nation, and the mask isn't used to protect people from them."
94,62,"Apparently the ""Mask the guy that wears a mask to protect himself "" is an old joke."
95,62,"I’d be so embarrassed if someone tried to call me out on my sex life, but my boyfriend would be really concerned about my sex life. I'd be afraid I would kill myself in the middle of the highway, in my car, in the street, in the middle of the highway, and in the middle of my car, in the middle of my car..."
65,62,No kidding. It's not as if the government is doing something that can stop the spread of a virus and it's using that as an excuse to help people.
71,62,"I'd say in Georgia, wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
73,62,"In the first paragraph of your title, I said the government's effort to help prevent the spread of a virus. He's trying to force the person to wear a mask, and that's one way to make sure people are not allergic to the virus."
85,62,"I'd also say that because the CDC has found a very good source to make that up, he's a real sarcastic skeptic, so he is trying to make the point that the hat is a sign that the government is invading the people. Whether he is correct or not is not a question of whether this is a good idea."
94,62,"Apparently the ""Mask the guy that wears a mask to protect himself "" is an old joke."

73,62,"People are taking the mask as an opportunity to work through shitstorms, so that they will get a good shot of frankness from them."
85,62,What you just said sounds like a really terrible movie.
94,62,Well a hammer isn't supposed to stop the spread of any kind of illness unless you have an actual diagnosis or treatment.
95,62,I think the issue is that the government would be able to prevent a virus from spreading and that the threat would increase the risk of the virus if the virus were infecting.
65,62,The idea of a mask is a joke.
71,62,"I mean, the saying is, ""I'm from Georgia, but I want to make my life better"" and ""I don't know where I live or how I've heard it said, but I want to make my life better. I think that's a good one. I think I'm going to be like, ""Hey, I'm from Georgia, but I want to make my life better. I'm not from Georgia."""
73,62,"Is it a joke, just because you can't put it on?"
85,62,The people on the front page of news organizations.

65,62,The idea of a mask is a joke.

73,62,You have a problem with it. The mask is not a joke. It is a security tool.
85,62,"I am afraid people are trying to use this to justify the admonition they were getting. Sadly, people are not getting it."
94,62,I'm going to guess that's what the article suggests:
95,62,"There's a video at a psych center that talks about the government's use of the term ""virus"" to prevent people from carrying the virus. It shows how the government can work in many ways."
65,62,"They are in some cases saying that it's a joke, and they are making a naive guess. Clearly there's nothing to be done, because their words are sour or they are a joke, but they are using them as an excuse to stop people from getting sick."
71,62,I can't wait for my next trip to Georgia.

85,62,"A doctor has to have a helmet on for it to work properly, because it is an incredibly common occurrence of the AIDS virus and it's very hard to predict if the vaccine will go away from you or not. The truth is that vaccines are a felony, so that could not be the case. I'm not sure if they'd be able to pass the fda on without one, but it wouldn't work in a democracy without the other."
94,62,The article says a lot about this....because the people that say they wear a mask aren't doing anything wrong.
95,62,I do not understand why you have an idiom like this. It seems like a lot of the people who use it aren't as smart as you.
65,62,"I'm not sure why he's going to go ninja this, it sounds like a great idea."
71,62,"I feel like there is too much that has not been said. In the past it seemed more like an immature guy. I think the joke is, ""...we're going to have to leave Georgia. I'm going to leave Georgia."""

85,62,"CANNOTANSWER: a mask would be an ill-fitting idea to protect people in the first place and thus would make people more infected than anyone else. Unlike a normal mask, it's not really a ""future"" idea unless it's actually a thing."
94,62,"No. Just because someone said it's about the government doesn't mean they're correct. It's only about the government. It's just that the government should go to the trouble of getting people vaccinated or some other reason, or just the lack of appropriateness of the idea of the government."
95,62,"I get it, I just hate the idiom a lot. Whether it's funny, or not, the idea of wearing a mask is actually funny... but I have never seen a funny one in a long time."
65,62,OP: People are supposed to do their own research. And I don’t think this is a joke.
71,62,"What does ""Sorry, I'm sorry, but the government is a horrible place to live"" mean?"
73,62,The problem is with the government. The government can't be a joke. They're doing it to keep a people from being allergic to it. They should ban all people from wearing masks.
85,62,...I'm still on reddit and I don't have an answer for you. Please stop.
94,62,It's kind of interesting that people are arguing about this issue and not about the specific facts. The idea that it's a joke isn't really valid.

85,62,So there is no reason to wear a mask without being vaccinated? The vaccine is a felony and the government doesn't like it. The government wants it 'foster'.

It's a joke because you're joking, because your humor is obnoxious, and you're naive. So the question is not ""why would you make such a joke?"" But that's not the point.

65,62,"The joke is very... clever, yes, but it's a joke."
71,62,"I think the whole thing makes sense to me because I have had experiences like this with the ""Pete Against the State"" kind of thing."
73,62,"Apparently this is a joke, and that doesn't make sense."
85,62,The article says that the ACA is designed to protect people who have an infectious disease.
94,62,I don't think I've read the article - but I do think the CDC is trying to stop the spread of a virus.
95,62,You've got the problem of it getting lost and not going to get any answers.
65,62,CANNOTANSWER: What's this a joke?
71,62,"We are the ""Teachers of the State"", we're not talking about the ""Teachers of the State."" We're talking about the ""Teachers of the State"" and the ""Teachers of the State"". We're talking about a teepee that we're allowed to wear while we're out of state. We're not allowed to wear a mask. We don't need to have a teepee. Then, when we're supposed to be in the state,"
73,62,What a troll.
85,62,"I’m just gonna leave this out because I read the article, and I’m not gonna read the comment or the actual wording."
94,62,I read your post at work.
95,62,I think it's funny because people are a little bit more confident in how they're perceived by a stranger.
65,62,"It’s a joke and I think it’s a joke if I remember correctly. I can’t imagine it’s even possible because it’s a joke, and I don’t think it’s possible to just say hey - this is just a joke. :"
71,62,I am in the United States and there is no place like that.
73,62,'Pause you were getting a bad shitjob if I'm not a nutjob'
85,62,It seems to me that the ACA is a joke and that it's meant to protect people from infections that are not infectious. It's not meant to be used as an excuse to be a prick.
94,62,The issue here is about the government.
95,62,"CANNOTANSWER: ''When you put the mask on, it's going to prevent a virus from spreading.''"
65,62,I don't think it's really a joke. But I think it's a joke.

94,62,"In an anti-virus article, it says that ""the government can't use it as a restraining order."""
95,62,"There are many things people have to consider, such as whether ""wearing a mask"" is a joke or not. They're not saying they don't like it, they're saying ""we don't like it because of a joke"" which isn't really the reason."
65,62,It's actually really a joke.
71,62,"As the author of the article says, ""I'm looking for some information that suggests a different way to look at the situation."
73,62,"People are taking the mask as an opportunity to work through shitstorms, so that they will get a good shot of frankness from them."
85,62,Is it the fact that it's a joke?
94,62,I think the difference is the fact that it's been reported that vaccination is a joke that has no meaning. A good joke that does not make a joke in an anti-virus article is that the CDC is not a federal agency.
95,62,I’m going to go right to the front page for the first time.
65,62,"I grew up in a country where you're being dubbed a ""skeptic"" by those people."
71,62,"I mean, I don't know what you're thinking, but I don't know what you're talking about. That's a pretty silly idea and I don't think it's the point of the article."
73,62,Why can't we just ban it and make sure we aren't allergic?

I should wear a mask of some sort to fight that disease""?'', '"
94,62,What I mean is this: This is a joke about people who say they don't want to fight a virus.
95,62,"I'm gonna say he's a nerd, I don't know the r/myspace username."
65,62,I think the difference in the comments is that it’s a joke. But it’s a joke. The point is that the point of a joke is that it makes no sense to me. The point of a joke is that it’s a joke because the government is acting against the government. They are acting against the government.
71,62,"As you pointed out, I do not believe the issue is related to the US government, but rather to the 'government'."

85,62,"It sounds like the doc is trying to tell a joke, not to make it a joke."
94,62,It is really a joke.
95,62,The government uses it to prevent people from spreading a virus. It's not a joke at all. It's just a joke.
65,62,"It's a joke because it's a joke, that's what makes it funny."
71,62,"It seems that this doesn't necessarily contradict the discussion, but rather that the discussion is about the sex slavery thing in question."
73,62,CANNOTANSWER.
85,62,It's a joke. And it would be a joke if people who aren't vaccinated wore a mask without being vaccinated. You can't have a joke without being vaccinated. You can't have a joke without being vaccinated.

71,62,"So the article is about the US Government making the ""Georgia "" a great place to live? Apparently that was not the right way to approach it, and that the government should not have allowed it. This is not a ""Georgia""."
73,62,This isn't a joke.
85,62,I'd like to say that in my opinion the ACA is a joke. It's the way the President is acting and making jokes about what he has been doing.
94,62,People are supposed to think that these masks stop the spread of any type of illness and stop the spread of a virus. I've found it very useful for identifying individuals with HIV. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to help stop the spread of a virus.
95,62,"I love to make fun of the government, but my own experience was that I used the same idiom as an american man who lived in Canada. I grew up in Canada, I'm from the U.S. and I've never heard of this joke."
65,62,If you wear a mask and don’t want to make the government go ninja you should say you’re an idiot. This makes me feel awkward a little...
71,62,"If you're referring to the article, then it seems like it's the one where the article is trying to cover things up and that's what the article is talking about."
73,62,The joke is very funny and in a good way.
85,62,"You suck. It’s not your job to be a hive mind, it’s your job to make a joke. It’s not your job to get people to be sick, it’s your job to provide safety for those who aren’t being vaccinated. It’s all about the people. They’re scum. It’s your job to be a good person."
94,62,It is not a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke because it's the government's job to prevent the spread of the virus.
95,62,It's a joke. It's funny.

85,62,I'm so sorry. I didn't read the original article i read.
94,62,"Well, I am saying that you're describing the CDC's job to protect people from the spread of the virus."
95,62,You can’t change a hat in the mash. It doesn’t help you.
65,62,People are supposed to do their own research. And I don’t think it’s a joke.

94,62,This is the correct answer. This is a question about whether or not we can ban this thing.
95,62,I haven't heard a joke about that. I'm going to start typing a joke that I like but I've never heard before that I would call it a joke. The fact that it's a joke is funny.
65,62,Because the CDC is acting like a dick.
71,62,The first sentence makes sense as the two sentences are related. The second sentence makes sense because of a sexist and dickish quote.
73,62,I don't think you have an answer for the question and I am not suggesting it. Is there any reason to not like the Obama administration?
85,62,"I was trying to write a bit about this as well. I've read all of the things you listed, I didn't get a chance to see any of them."
94,62,It seems like a joke. I think that's not a joke. The article does it anyway. There's nothing that people are saying about it.

73,62,No. It's a joke.
85,62,The ACA is a joke. But it isn't meant to protect people - because the ACA is a joke. It's a joke and is designed to protect people from illnesses that aren't infectious. I don't think the ACA is a joke or is going to work.
94,62,Affirmative action is the better option.
95,62,It's been a while since we've spoken about the 'viruses' in a'report'. 'Viruses' aren't a joke because they spread through a virus. 'Viruses' aren't a joke because it's a virus.

71,62,I see nothing wrong with people like this.
73,62,"a prank in which someone uses an adjective like ""euphoric, hypnotic, or hypnotic"" is a joke."
