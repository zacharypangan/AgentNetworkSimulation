101,99,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
99,29,"You don't have to wear a mask, you just have to wear an Oval and a helmet."
99,30,It's not really possible to have Santa wearing a mask.
99,32,The dissenting opinion here is that there is no official statement saying that a huge covid does not have a mask.

99,40,It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
99,48,"The only thing to keep in mind when discussing a viral mascot is the amount of shit the government does that you can't really do, or that is a good idea. If it's an official holiday in my area it could be quite helpful. I'm a fan of that movie too and I'm sure there is a way to stop it."
99,58,I'm so glad there are people that really have been trying to do this.
99,63,"Hmm, I have no idea what he meant by wearing a mask."
99,68,I think that’s very important to the cause of the virus.
99,81,I know. And I know.. I know. I know.. I know..
99,93,"Wow I would love to see this, if only I could get a mask with the number of santas that were wearing"
101,99,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
99,29,It's not really possible to have Santa wearing a mask. I think that's very important to the cause of the virus.
99,30,"I think you could get a hoodie, but they also need a mask."
99,32,"It's a bit like the American holiday of 'indulging in the sick', but instead of removing it from the scene, you wear a mask and santa doesn't even get to wear it."
99,33,"I would love to see this, if only I could get a mask with the number of santas that were wearing Wearing masks does not help in stopping the spread of a virus, it's useless and I hate it. You don't have to wear a mask, you just have to wear an Oval and a helmet. It's not really possible to have Santa wearing a mask."
99,40,"It's not even a matter of whether the mask is required for the mascot. It's just that it's not required for the mascot to be a mascot, because he's going to have to wear a mask to keep a santa out of that parade and have him go to the parade for a few days."
99,48,"I was looking at the thread with my phone and thought hey I don't have one, but I do have one. I am sure I am. I have nothing to complain about. It says that it isn't important, but a big part of the conversation is why there is no official statement. It seems like that is what it is. But it just doesn't sound appropriate for me to say something like ""We need a mask!"" or ""We need a mask!"" or ""We need to get it done."
99,58,"He's trying to prevent the spread of the virus by spreading a santa mask, but I'm not sure if it's true at all."
99,63,"I really hate the name of this movie. The only thing I can think of that's not really possible is for everyone to go, and have a good time with the movie."
99,68,"I don't see how a mask would not help in stopping the spread of the virus, or even make it easier to get around it. It is also part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."
99,81,"OP, you should read about this and the fact that if you have a virus on Halloween or something, I would hate to see a video where Santa wears a mask. It's a big, scary thing. I'd love to see it too."

99,32,"So, there's the santa mask at Santa's house."
99,33,You're not even a santa.
99,40,A santa wearing a mask in the Halloween parade would have been so powerful and such an endorsement of healthcare heroes wearamask.
99,48,The people here seem to be really passionate about the subject. I mean the point of this post is that it isn't something I know anything about. But I guess it's just part of the concept of trying to prevent and stop spreading the virus.
99,58,That sounds pretty awful. I'd think the santa costume would have been a little more interesting.
99,63,"oh I'm a cyborg. I'm not that crazy. But what can I say? I've just heard that the movie is a bit overdue and a bit too vague, because the cyborg shit-job of the movie. That's what I've been saying as a kid. I feel like this is a joke."

101,99,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
99,29,I just saw a movie like this. There was a lot of snide comments on this sub and I never understood why it was a joke.
99,30,> Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
99,32,"It's not an endorsement, but just a joke."

99,48,"I feel that a santa wearing a mask is a pretty good idea, especially since it's not about what the person wearing it is going to wear. Specifically, it's about bringing in the message and being able to get the message across without worrying about a virus spreading."
99,58,"He wears a mask to stop the spread of the virus. It's not even a matter of whether the mask is required for the mascot. It's just that it's not required for the mascot to be a mascot, because he's going to have to wear a mask to keep a santa out of that parade and have him go to the parade for a few days."

99,68,I don't think it's a joke. I think it's just the way the cyborg shitjob is.

99,29,I'd be worried if there were other costumes. I'd be worried if they were a dick.

99,33,I think the movie is hilarious. It's not about the issue of a virus.
99,40,"I think you're right. I'm not even trying to be crazy, but I do enjoy the movie if you are, because it is an interesting retelling of what was made into a joke a couple of years back."
99,48,"I'd say it's a bit odd that Santa doesn't wear a mask in the parade because he's going to have to wear a mask to keep a santa from going and wearing the mask to prevent the spread of the virus. That's a really weird a phrase, but isn't going to stop the spread of a virus."
99,58,"In order to prevent this, a santa wearing a mask would have been so powerful. The santa would be wearing a mask to keep a santa out of the parade and have him go to the parade for a few days."
99,63,I don't think it's a joke. I think it's just the way the cyborg shitjob is. It's not overdue for the movie and it is very vague.
99,68,There was a lot of snide comments on this sub and I never understood why it was a joke.
99,81,The entire thing that is a joke despite the movie being snide is so bad it's too easy to put an end to it.
99,93,I think you are just trying to be kind to yourself with your opinions.

You could use a more appropriate description of a ""strange, creepy, creepy,"
99,33,"You're not even a santa, but that's not about the issue of the virus."
99,40,What if Santa doesn't wear a mask in the parade? Apparently this movie was a lot more snide than just a joke.
99,48,I thought it was funny. But I guess that is not the real point.

99,81,It's not a joke because of the title. It's a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke because it's not a joke because the title is... not snide. It's a joke because it's not snide because it's so bad it's too easy to put an end to it.
99,93,I'd like to watch that movie. It's an interesting retelling of what was made into a joke a couple of years back.
101,99,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
99,29,Is wearing a mask a joke? Maybe. But it doesn't seem like a joke because the title isn't snide.
99,30,CANNOTANSWER A WINNY?
99,32,You're just trying to be snide. It's a joke because it's the kind of thing you could do without it.
99,33,"I was a big fan of this movie too. It was funny and the cyborg shitjob was a great example of it. But the whole we need a mask thing sucked. Whether the santa was a joke or not, if you can't tell me what you think, I think you have something wrong with it."
99,40,"The movie is a lot like a joke about how you're not wearing a cyborg mask for Christmas, it's just a funny funny feisty costume. It's not going to stop the spread of a virus. The santa will not be in the parade, and the santa will go to the parade, but the santa will be in the parade."
99,48,"I think it's a funny thing that ""Santa wears a mask to prevent the spread of a virus."" or that it's just the way the santa shitjob is. Or maybe it just makes him look like a little troll to everyone, and they might get a kick out of it a few days into the parade. I'm not sure why that's a funny thing."
99,58,It's not a joke because the title isn't snide. It's just the way the cyborg shitjob is. It's just the way the cyborg shitjob is.
99,63,I like santa's clothes. The costume gives him a great effect on others.
99,68,This isn't a joke.
99,81,"I think a very good idea is that if you have a virus, it will spread to you."
99,93,"I like what I like about the movie. I am not a santa or a clown. I don't like the way the movie ends, nor the characters, or the acting, but I think I am right about this."
101,99,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
99,29,It's one of those things that is not even a joke. It's all a joke about the fact that people think that dressing up like a cyborg is a joke.
99,30,> What if Santa doesn't wear a mask in the parade? Apparently this movie was a lot more snide than just a joke.
99,32,The title was snide. The whole “We Need a Mask” thing was a joke.
99,33,"I think we're all too sensitive to the importance of the title. In fact, the title is really about a movie that is not a joke. But I think the title is overly snide. It's not a joke because the title is too obvious."
99,40,I don't understand the question of who actually wears a mask and who doesn't?
99,48,"I'd also like to add that you may have heard about the movie that's not only a joke, but a joke, because you do have one. That's not a joke. You could also say that you think it's funny to see that a santa wearing a mask was a joke based on the title, which isn't so obvious."
99,58,A santa's wearing a mask does not help to prevent the spread of a virus. I think it's just the way the cyborg shitjob is. The whole we need a mask thing sucked.
99,63,"I would say, ""I do not like the way the movie ends, nor the characters, or the acting, but I think I am right about this. Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of a virus."
99,68,"In this case, it's a joke because you don't want to do it, which I think is a joke."
99,81,It's not a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke because it's not snide because it's too easy to put an end to it.
99,93,I'm just gonna throw out that the cyborg costume was really cool. Obviously it's a joke but I don't think it was funny.
101,99,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
99,29,"That is a very valid point, especially when you consider that ""Santa's wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of a virus. It's just the way the cyborg shitjob is."
99,30,> How santa wears a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
99,32,"I think we need to start thinking about the underlying causes of these things. Like the lack of a mask and how the morals of society in this movie, is one of the most important issues that we need to discuss."
99,33,"What if someone says ""You wear a mask"" and then replies ""I want you to wear a mask.""?"
99,40,I think the hilarity of the title was really good. There is no semblance of humor here.
99,48,"In addition to what they say, “I think it's not funny that Santa doesn't wear a mask because he's going to have to wear the mask to prevent the spread of a virus.”"
99,58,"If you don't like the movie, you are not a good person to help. I'm just going to throw out that the cyborg costume was really cool. Obviously it's a joke but I don't think it was funny."
99,63,"If they wear a mask in the parade, it's probably going to give the rest of the crowd a chuckle."
99,68,The title isn't a joke. The whole We Need a Mask thing is a joke.
99,81,We need a mask - they are not supposed to be funny - they are supposed to be pretty.
99,93,"I would just say: ""I like what I like about the movie. I am not a santa or a clown. I don't like the way the movie ends, nor the characters, or the acting, but I think I am right about this."""
101,99,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
99,29,What the cyborgs wear is a joke because it's a joke.
99,30,"I think a lot of people think that the movie is a joke, but that's not what I meant."
99,32,"The ""We Need a Mask"" thing was a joke, which makes sense. The ""We need a mask"" thing isn't a joke. I think the ""We Need a Mask"" thing was actually a joke and is a little vague."
99,33,Isn't wearing a mask more important than the use of a mask? Those two have been used in a lot of movies - most of them where the actors had no way of knowing what the name was in the title.
99,40,"Unless I'm wrong, it would be a joke. It sounds more like a joke than anything."
99,48,"I was just thinking about what I should write next, because if people are not aware of a virus, it's just that there is no way to stop it, and there is a great deal of talk to be had about it, and to put an end to it. I was also saying I wouldn't mind if the people who voted for him said that it's okay for them to have a mask, because it's a joke."
99,58,"A santa wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I don't understand the question of who actually wears a mask and who doesn't?

99,63,I have seen this movie a thousand times and it is very similar to a movie called We Need a Mask.
99,68,People don't wear masks. People don't wear masks. People don't wear masks.
99,81,"They're the reason why we don't like it if people think the title is snide. If you don't like the movie, you're not a santa or clown. I'm not a santa or clown."
99,93,"I would say, ""Well, I don't see any problem with the santa wearing a mask"", or ""well I don't see anything with the cyborg costume""."
101,99,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
99,29,"A cyborg mask is a joke. The word cyborg is used to indicate that a person wears a mask to prevent the spread of a virus. It doesn't mean they aren't using it in a joke. Whether they wear it or not is a matter of personal opinion, but it's a matter of their own personal opinion. The whole joke is to prevent someone from wearing a cyborg shitjob."
99,30,I think there are some things you can say about the tv televised movies like this that might be relevant here - but the one he did in the trailer is a joke:
99,32,"This makes me a little skeptical. I've always wanted to see the movie ""We Need a Mask"" and it's a joke and that's just one example."
99,33,"I'm not a doctor, but I know a doctor. He explains to people how to wear a mask when the doctor is telling a story that they are allergic to any virus and that they do not have to wear a mask because they are allergic."
99,40,I just wanted to mention that I'm not sure why we didn't have a santa at Christmas. I have a santa costume and she's in a santa costume. She seems to love the santa costume and I like her cyborg costume.
99,48,People are the reason why we don't like it.
99,58,>I'm just going to throw out that the cyborg costume was really cool.
99,63,I'm not sure this is a joke. I mean... it doesn't have the 'cyborg costume' and the cyborg costume...
99,68,Wearing a mask in the parade was a hilarity apology. It makes no sense and everyone gets a chuckle.
99,81,"I think you're right, but we need a new and improved one. I think people do need to find a new word for it:"
99,93,This is a fucking joke.
101,99,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
99,29,The fact that it's a joke that the title is snide makes me skeptical.
99,30,Until the movie arrives in theaters and the santa has to wear a mask.
99,32,"A large part of our culture is very sceptical about the idea of wearing a mask, as well as people who might not be aware of it."
99,33,Until this day there are millions of people with a virus and people are sick or dying of it all the time.
99,40,"I don't like the cyborg costumes and the idea of the santa in them, but I think the santa is just as cute and cute as the santa's."
99,48,">I would say, ""Well, I don't see any problem with the santa wearing a mask"", or ""Well I don't see anything with the cyborg costume""."
99,58,"I'm a fan of the movie, and it was pretty funny. It's not just a joke. It was actually pretty cool. I've seen it a few times before, and it's pretty funny. It just didn't work. I thought it'd be funny if it were."
99,63,"I am not a doctor, but I know many people who are allergic to the virus and a doctor who explains how to wear a mask in a movie and in the movie explains how they are allergic to the cyborg costumes."
99,68,I don't see how it makes any sense to have a person wearing a mask in the parade because it's hilarious. It's the same way a clown does. It's not a joke.
99,81,You were talking about an actual joke.
99,93,No! Because this guy was wearing a mask and I like it.
101,99,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
99,29,"As an allergic person, it's very possible that the cyborg mask is a joke, especially as you are not a doctor. You don't get to wear the mask unless you are allergic."
99,30,A santa wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
99,32,"It's not a joke and it doesn't sound right. It's just not a joke. And, the most important point of the story is that a cyborg costume isn't the only kind of costume that would be good for the person who's in that costume. And it's not like an actual Halloween costume would be. And, the fact that it was a joke makes it sound silly and it's useless and it doesn't sound right, is a ridiculous joke."
99,33,"It's not the whole ""I love the santa"" part. It's the people who think it's a joke."
99,40,"This is a very simple point. A cloner who has had an hilarity joke about the issue is not going to like the idea of a cloner wearing a mask and is going to have to have a cloner to avoid people who may have it. It would be fun to put it in your face. I'm not saying that the cloner is a joke, but it's an acceptable excuse for a non-sleeping cloner."
99,48,"I think it's funny that Santa doesn't wear a mask because of what people think of it, and the fact that he didn't actually tell the people in his line of work about it."
99,58,"""This is a fucking joke. Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of a virus. It's just the way the cyborg shitjob is. It's just the way the cyborg shitjob is."""
99,63,NAME> What about the movie?
99,68,I've read this several times. There are very interesting stories about people who have been in the position of wearing masks.
99,81,"The joke was just like ""I'm not a doctor, but I know many people who are allergic to the virus and a doctor who explains how to wear a mask in a movie and in the movie explains how they are allergic to the cyborg costumes."""
99,93,"I am trying to figure out what you mean by that. I don't want to sound like a crazy person, but I like this movie."
101,99,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
99,29,That's not the reason.
99,30,"The movie I just read was about a guy in a cyborg costume, who was allergic to the virus and decided to play with his mask, because he knew that the guy had no idea what to do. I thought it was funny but I didn't."
99,32,"That's a very interesting fact, because you're only reading a small part of the movie. It's not a joke. It's just not a joke."
99,33,It's a joke.
99,40,>I don't think it makes any sense to have a person wearing a mask in the parade because it's funny. It's just the way the cyborg shitjob is.
99,48,"And you're also going to be saying: ""My god...it is a joke to be in a mask!"""
99,58,It's a cloner. A cloner is a cloner. A cloner is a cloner.
99,63,"I think they're just trying to put on some cool costumes, and people can't stand wearing a mask."
99,68,It doesn't help in stopping the spread of a virus.
99,81,I think it's interesting that there is a doctor who explains how to wear a mask at a film festival.
99,93,"> I don't want to sound like a crazy person, but I like this movie."
101,99,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
99,29,I've never heard it used that way.
99,30,"I don't know about this, but it sounds like you know some really interesting facts and theories about the spread of the virus, including the fact that a doctor can help prevent this, but they also think it's silly to have the santa wearing a mask."
99,32,I think it's a joke that's not just a funny part of the film.
99,33,The whole thing that makes the whole thing so funny isn't even the title. It's just not the idea of a mask at all. It's just not a joke. It's not a joke. It's a joke.
99,40,There's no way the entire movie could be taken seriously without a mask.
99,48,I've seen this one.
99,58,"It's funny that the movie isn't a joke, but because it's a comedy film about the cyborgs that will spread the virus."
99,63,It's a cloner in a mask?
99,68,People don't wear masks because the doctor who explains how to wear a mask tells you something is wrong. They are using a mask to stop the spread of the virus. You don't have to wear a mask to stop the spread of the virus. You have to wear a mask to stop the spread of the virus.
99,81,A cloner wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.This is a very simple point. A cloner who has had an hilarity joke about the issue is not going to like the idea of a cloner wearing a mask and is going to have to have a cloner to avoid people who may have it. It would be fun to put it in your face. I think it's funny that Santa doesn't wear a mask because of the title.
99,93,"It's kind of ironic that Santa has his head around the'suck' part of his face, and it's so freaking funny that he didn't wear a mask because it was the cloner that had the problem. He didn't realize that he was a clown and he wished he had a helmet and had a suit."
101,99,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
99,29,Is wearing a mask part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus?
99,30,"> I think it's funny that the movie isn't a joke, but because it's a comedy film about the cyborgs that will spread the virus."
99,32,I have never seen a movie with a very funny title in it.
99,33,"The title was a joke and that title sounded silly, because you were actually saying ""Hack the masks!"" or something like that. You are also implying that people are crazy."
99,40,This is a really good idea.
99,48,"I don't understand why this is the OP's main point. It's a joke and people don't care about the mascot at all. People do, however, hate wearing a mask."
99,58,"''He wears a mask to stop the spread of a virus. It's just the way the cyborg shitjob is. ''If you don't like the movie, you are not a good person to help. I'm just going to throw out that the cloner in a mask was really cool."
99,63,"I don't see a difference between ""Carol cloner"" and ""We Need a Mask"" in a movie. There isn't really much difference between ""Which cloner"" and ""We Need a Mask"" or ""Crazy."""
99,68,I'm going to have to go read that...
99,81,"I'm a big fan of that movie, because that was a funny movie - and that's why I'm happy to see it. It also sounds like a great comedy movie - because there is so much more to it."
99,93,The troll is making it clear that it is all about the 'whoops'.
101,99,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
99,29,I'm an avid fan of movies with a lot of people that have been sick from them. I think the whole point of this movie is to prevent the spread of the virus.
99,30,"I don't like it, but the movie is incredibly humorous."
99,32,"It doesn't sound like a joke to me. A lot of people would get upset about it, but that's a part of the story of the movie."
99,33,There are a lot of people who want a mask that doesn't have a mask.
99,40,"It's not a joke. It's a film about a cloner who would be wearing a mask if his clone weren't in the parade to get a shot of the santa. It's also a comedy film that has no semblance of humor in it, but it would be funny to put it in the parade and santa will be in there for a few days."
99,48,i'm an anti-virus guy.
99,58,This is a great movie and I'm a huge fan of it. It was so good. I loved it.
99,63,"I don't see how this is a joke at all. In my opinion, it is a joke, and the movie doesn't even seem to have a cloner part. I've seen this movie a dozen times and the title of this one made me laugh at it."
99,68,I like to think of a lot of movies that use cloners to disguise the cyborg shitjob. They are so funny that people will find their clones'so sick. '' They are not a good idea because they are just as dangerous and will spread it. They are just so cool and weird that they're just being silly.
99,81,I think the joke is that the cloner is going to wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus.
99,93,"'I'd just say: ""Well, I don't want to sound like a crazy person, but I like this movie."","
101,99,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
99,29,OP is making a petty joke.
99,30,Then a cloner in a mask.
99,32,What does the troll say about a movie that you just read? You can't help it. You can't do it.
99,33,I feel like you don't know the purpose of the title.
99,40,The idea of a cloner and santa in a cloner costume is very strange.
99,48,"I think you might have already made a generalization that ""santa wears a mask"" is a joke, but the point is that it is a funny idea. It isn't that people like it."
99,58,"I don't think that he is trying to stop the spread of a virus because he wears a mask, but that's not what I understand it to mean."
99,63,"This is a very common issue I hear on the news and on the news - the only thing I can think of that isn't really possible is for everyone to go, and have a good time with the movie. [NAME]: a joke."
99,68,"This is exactly how the virus is being spread. I don't know if i will be able to put this out on an episode of TMNT yet, but I think the humor of it is still pretty cool."
99,81,"People will not accept that it is a joke, because there is more to the story. The joke might not be true, but its not in a way to discredit the point."
99,93,It's kind of ironic that Santa doesn't wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus.
101,99,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
99,29,>What the cyborgs wear is a joke. The word cyborg is used to indicate that a person wears a mask to prevent the spread of a virus.
99,30,OP just needs to realize that he's trying to stop the spread of a virus because of some stupidity and he's trying to make the joke a shitjob.
99,32,I would like to say something else. I think the movie is a bit overdue but there is no official statement that a huge covid does not have a mask.
99,33,"""""An Oval and a helmet."""" ""It's not really possible to have Santa wearing a mask."""""""
99,40,"""But it's a good idea. The idea of a cloner and santa in a cloner costume is very strange."
99,48,"In the past, I was constantly told that it's a joke, that people don't like it, and that that's exactly what's up with the joke."
99,58,I think I like the joke as well. I love the cloner as well.
99,63,"""Woody, I love this movie, but I feel like this is a joke."""
99,68,"The title isn't a joke, but it is the way the story is being told. This makes sense, but I think it is still pretty cool."
99,81,"A ""cloner"" could use a clone and wear a mask, though, and possibly be a medical name for it. If you know there are multiple versions that have an effect on that, you can always make it a joke with the clone. That's all it's asking you to do."
99,93,Wearing a mask to stop the spread of a virus.
101,99,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
99,29,I'm a cloner.
99,30,"OP's reaction was to use the word ""joke"" to express his disgust at the idea of a clone and wearing a mask. He was implying he liked a clone and thought the idea of a clone was ""increasingly silly"" and so he just chose not to use the word ""joke."""
99,32,The joke is a joke. There is no official statement saying that it is not a joke. It is a joke. It is a joke. The whole 'We Need a Mask' thing isn't a big deal. It's just the way the cyborg shitjob is. I think it is a joke.
99,33,''What the cyborgs wear is a joke.
99,40,It's the first movie I've seen of a cloner on TMNT that I've seen.
99,48,"The clone and the santa is a cloner. He's a cloner. His eyes are made of cloned clones. He's supposed to wear a clone mask but he's not dressed as a clone, so he is a clone. He's supposed to be wearing a clone because he's a clone."
99,58,"It's actually very interesting. The cloner's costume looks a little weird, but I think it's worth watching. It's not the same as a mask."
99,63,[What is this joke?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sac_by_no_i_am_a_dyna=7x2XcXxXfXdo0edd4hd6b0b)
99,68,This joke was made out of a very different subject.
99,81,"A lot of the jokes in the movie seem really simple. Honestly, I think you're going to have to tell people exactly what a joke is."
99,93,It's a joke. It's a fucking joke.
101,99,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
99,29,OP was making a joke a few days ago. Not sure how much of a petty joke it is.
99,30,"It's funny because the clones are in the same costume as clones. But this clone is still supposed to be in the same outfit as Santa. He has the same body as a clone, and the clone is supposed to be in the same costume as a clone."
99,32,"I've seen a lot of these in the past. I'm not a big fan of the one I like, but I'm kinda sick of this joke."
99,33,"I think there are other things we need to be aware of as well, but if the joke doesn't work, then I'm not sure. The movie is really a joke. A clone in a clone is just a joke. Besides, you're a cloner. He's supposed to be wearing a clone and he's supposed to be wearing a clone, but he's not dressed as a clone, which is also not a joke. So, he'"
99,40,"OP's reaction was to use the word ""joke"" to express his disgust at the idea of a cloner wearing a mask. It's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. But it's a good idea."
99,48,It's also funny that the movie cloners have so much power over other people that they are able to get sick in a clone clone.
99,58,"I'm going to put the clone on a mask, and say that it isn't a joke."
99,63,I think I have heard of this. Mostly because I didn't have enough time to learn this and feel silly for having to read some of the ramblings here.
99,68,i dont wear masks and wear clone in the parade :) it's pretty cool
99,81,They say it's a joke. That's what they are trying to say.
99,93,"""We need a mask. We have a mask. We don't need one because that's what we want it to be."""
101,99,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
99,29,The word clone.
99,30,"""Cinder cloners"": a clone and a clone wearing a mask is just a joke"
99,32,It's a petty joke. But that's why it's a joke.
99,33,">It's actually very interesting. The clone's costume looks a little weird, but I think it's worth watching. It's not the same as a mask."
99,40,I have a clone as a costume and I think it's a joke.
99,48,>I didn't have enough time to learn this and feel silly for having to read some of the ramblings here.
99,58,"It is a joke, it is just an attempt to show how a clone can be used to help others, and to tell someone that the clone's clone is a clone. I'd say it's a joke."
99,63,"The whole ""I am not a doctor, but I know many people who are allergic to the virus and a doctor who explains how to wear a mask in a movie and in the movie explains how they are allergic to the cyborg costume."" is an incredibly bad joke because if you're not allergic to a cyborg costume, the cyborg costume can cause a major problem. It's so obvious and unprofessional that even in such a simple fashion it doesn't get better at treating those clone clone joke joke"
99,68,"It's a joke. I hate it, but it is still funny and the morality of the joke isn't really that good. The joke isn't about what is not a joke, it's about what isn't a joke and what isn't a joke. The joke is that 'It's a joke', because the joke isn't about what isn't a joke."
99,81,"I think you're right that people have to tell people exactly what a joke is. It's a joke because 'they're the reason why we don't like it if people think the title is snide'. ""They say it's a joke because they're a joke because they aren't supposed to be funny."""
99,93,I've got some things for you.
101,99,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
99,29,"As I recall, the jokes have always been about how a clone is not necessary to protect people. A clone in a clown costume is a joke based on that."
99,30,"The joke that comes with that title is not about clones. Rather, it's about the clones and the clones of a clone. It's a joke."
99,32,"It's not a joke, it's a joke because people are being overly literal about it. They have to start recognizing it as a joke, because it's a joke. It's a joke because it isn't a joke."
99,33,"I'm the one who tries to show that a clone mask is a joke, but it's not a joke. The clone is a joke, and the clone is a joke."
99,40,A clone is not just a clone. It's a clone. And not as nice as a clone on a clone.
99,48,"People just don't want to wear clones and have to wear masks to prevent the spread of the virus. That's why they call it a joke, that's why they call it a joke."
99,58,"The movie is a joke, it's funny because it's a joke. It's just a joke, it's a joke. It's a joke because the title isn't snide."
99,63,"In a world where people are allergic to virus and it's a joke, then everyone can be allergic to it. But that isn't something I can handle."
99,68,"It's not a joke, it's a joke about a joke about a joke, but about the clone. It's not a joke about a joke about a joke about the clone and it's not a joke."
99,81,"The best way to say a joke is ""I think it's a joke because I know many people who are allergic to the virus."""
99,93,"Honestly, the people who want to go to the parade aren't gonna get what they want. They will be there anyway and get paid to go to their own location and make a decision for themselves. It's hard, but they are the one that make the decision."
101,99,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
99,29,So it's actually a joke. You can't tell a joke without having to be a clone? No.
99,30,It's just a joke. It's a joke because the title isn't snide.
99,32,We need a mask and there's a joke about it. Apparently that's a joke because of the way it's named.
99,33,A clone is just a joke because it’s about a virus and they can wear it.
99,40,"Considering that these are essentially an apologetic joke and not an attempt to stop the spread of viruses and the joke makes no sense and makes no sense, I think this is just a simple but effective idea. The point is that we don't need a clone for Christmas because the clone doesn't feel obligated to wear a clone for a Christmas gift. So that means we don't need to make the whole Halloween a joke. The movie is a joke."
99,48,I have to say a lot of people just don't really like it.
99,58,"You were making a joke, a joke is the name of a joke. It is a joke about the same thing that it is a joke about, which is the reason the joke isn't a joke."
99,63,You mean a joke about a joke about a joke about a joke about a joke about a joke?
99,68,It's a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke.
99,81,"A clone mask can do great things for those that aren't allergic, even if you don't have a clone clone."
99,93,"Despite being a joke, it's a fucking joke."
101,99,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
99,29,"I thought the movie was about something to do with people who are not allergic, and they say the movie explains why you were calling it a joke, not a joke. I thought the movie was about a clone, so the movie was actually about the clone."
99,30,"As a joker myself, I am a clone. The joke is about a person who is allergic to a virus and who doesn't want to wear a mask in the parade."
99,32,"It's a joke because it's about a virus, because it's not a joke."
99,33,So we're looking for the best kind of joke.
99,40,It is a joke because 'we're not even getting a chance to do a costume at the clone'. The point is that we don't need a clone for Christmas because we don't want to spend time in the movie.
99,48,"It is a joke and a joke because it's about something. A clone can do great things for people who aren't allergic to it. It's a joke because of the way it's named. A clone can do great things for those that aren't allergic, even if you don't have a clone clone. Despite being a joke, it's a fucking joke. A clone mask can do great things for people who aren't allergic to it."
99,58,"It's a joke. Besides, it's a joke."
99,63,ah yep.
99,68,"I don't know why you say that, but it's a joke."
99,81,"Because it's a joke, and it's a joke. A clone can clone people who don't like it but don't want to have to wear a mask. A clone can clone people who don't want to wear a mask because they don't like it, because it's actually a joke."
99,93,Then they call it a joke. Then they call it a joke.
101,99,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
99,29,"I don't know if this is actually a joke, but I think it's a joke that people are snide about the title of a cyborg costume, which is more of a joke than it is a joke."
99,30,I've read so many people rehash the jokes in this post. The first time I saw one was on December 7.
99,32,"As a clone clone, I find it hard to believe I haven't seen a joke about it."
99,33,"YES! It's an over-the-top nonsense... It's an over-the-top nonsense. It's literally the right thing to do. If it works for you, I'm going to rephrase my original statement. I'm not really going to even be able to do anything about it. It's a joke because the title is so snide."
99,40,He's saying it's because they have to be cloned by another clone to have the same benefit as Santa. I don't think they should make it a joke.
99,48,A lot of the comments that go along with this.
99,58,I have to say I don't get why you're calling it a joke. It's an attempt to make it so they can make a joke.
99,63,It's the same thing with the way people are treating viruses.
99,68,I think you're making a joke about a joke that is a joke and I have to say that it isn't a joke.
99,81,There's also a new way to say 'because it's a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke because it's not a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke because it's not a joke because it's not a joke because it's not a joke because it's not a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke about a joke about a joke about a
99,93,That is a joke. I think you are trying to be kind to yourself with your opinions.
101,99,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
99,29,"i think this movie is funny because of the ""snide"" comment about not wearing a mask and the joke about it not being a joke to the people who don't have a cyborg costume."
99,30,''We don't need a clone for Christmas because we don't want to spend time in the movie.'''
99,32,It's an awful joke.
99,33,He explains to people how to wear a clone mask when the doctor is telling a story that they are allergic to a virus and that they do not have to wear a mask. He also explains to people that he is supposed to be wearing a mask.
99,40,He's saying it's because the title is snide. He's saying it's because they have to be cloned by another clone to have the same benefit as Santa.
99,48,"Yes, it's a joke. You may have been thinking about it for some time, but it's not a joke. In fact it's a joke."
99,58,"I'm going to say the title is the joke, and not the joke. I'm just going to say that the clone cloner is a clone. I can't remember the last time I read that but I have read the first 3 or 4 y's. I haven't had a chance to see this movie."
99,63,"Then I would say, ""I don't know if this is actually a joke. It's a joke because the title is so snide. I think it's a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke because it's a joke about a joke about a joke about"
99,68,"I think the most interesting thing about the movie was that it compared to the way people are trying to treat the virus, because you're not getting a chance to be a clone and you don't want to know that the clone isn't a joke. It's like they are telling a joke about a joke because they're snide. It's a joke about something. It's a joke because they're being so funny. And I think you're trying to explain why it's a joke?"
99,81,"I think the jokes in the video are just...... that people don't understand the meaning of the title, they just don't care to look at them like they are a joke. I think the jokes are about a movie, it is a joke. The clone doesn't even have a title. I think the idea of an clone mask in the movie is a joke, and it makes a lot of sense to me."
99,93,"It sounds like the troll doesn't want to be the one making the joke, and I do like the joke."
101,99,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
99,29,"I'm not a doctor, but I think it's a joke that Santa is not wearing a mask and that a clone is being used as a joke to prevent the spread of a virus."
99,30,"""What if Santa doesn't wear a mask because of some stupidity and he's trying to make the joke a shitjob,"""
99,32,You need to stop being a troll.
99,33,"It's a joke. I think it is because it's a joke that everyone is being told, and it is a joke that all they ever really think about is the clone clone clone."
99,40,The title is kind of sexist.
99,48,'I hate that this is a joke.
99,58,The idea of wearing a mask on Santa and telling the story of how a clone can be used to help others is funny.
99,63,What is a joke? (I've seen a lot of this movie a dozen times and I feel like this is a joke. I don't think they should make it a joke.)
99,68,The joke is still hilarious and the morality of the joke isn't really that good.
99,81,What a snide comment!
99,93,"The point of the joke isn't to make it the actual joke, but to say you like it. The point is to make it the actual joke, but to make it the joke."
101,99,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
99,29,It's really just a joke.
99,30,There are people who want to get an ad santa wearing a mask but are not going to be able to get an ad santa. I would say that this is a joke.
99,32,There's a video on YouTube.
99,33,"It's a joke, you know?"
99,40,There are two types of jokes.
99,48,"I'm an anti-virus guy, and I'm a big fan of the film. The idea of the movie is pretty hilarious and a good thing. But the joke just goes beyond that."
99,58,""" ""That sounds pretty awful. I'm not sure if it's true at all."", ""I think the cloner in a mask would have been really cool."""
99,63,"So many things, like the fact that you're not a clone clone - not even the one you're allergic to - you see on TV and in the news - you just talk about the fact that you are allergic to a virus - but not that it makes you seem like a clown - but you don't think that it's a joke to make a joke about something so absurd and sexist - you're just saying ""I think it's a joke about that a joke about the fact that it'"
99,68,It's a joke because you don't want to do it.
99,81,This is where the jokes get really ridiculous.
99,93,I like the name cyborg costume. I haven't seen it but I'm pretty sure I like it.
101,99,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
99,29,"A clone in a clown costume? I think that's a joke, because the joke that they're using that word in the title is actually a joke."
99,30,"The joke is a joke. The joke isn't about the virus. It's about the fact that you're not a clone clone, but that you don't want to get an ad santa."
99,32,"The entire ""We Need a Mask"" joke seems too silly for some people. Clearly the people with the mask are only interested in santa."
99,33,I think you're a really dumb bitch.
99,40,"I'm a fan of the movies, I'm a fan of the whole fads that the comics spoof and even if I didn't like the humor. I would be really interested to see a movie about the movie in a way where it wasn't too much fun and the clones didn't seem like they were funny to me or something. And, at the same time, there are other examples of really fun humor, I'm kind of interested in a movie about how they're able to laugh at how funny it is to"
99,48,"> ""I don't like that this is a joke, but the point is that it is a joke."""
99,58,"... because that's the only reason I know it's not a joke. The way it was sexist, but that's just the joke."
99,63,"They were going to make a movie that wouldn't make us look at the whole virus problem as a joke, but instead just try to make it feel like the doctor explains how to use the clone, and the cyborgs aren't exactly different."
99,68,"Yes, we need a mask. That is a joke. It's a joke about a joke about a joke about a joke. Then you have to figure out what that is and get out til they say it's a joke."
99,81,I think the only way it should be funny is if santa was wearing a mask to scare off all the pixie dust.
99,93,I can't believe this is just one example of a joke that seems to be so ridiculous that it's actually a joke.
101,99,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."

99,30,"I see what you mean by the joke. I think it's funny because the movie is about a clone, a clown, and a clone in a clone. It's a joke, but not the actual joke, not the clone. It's a joke because the title isn't sexist and insulting. The whole thing that makes the whole thing so funny isn't the title, but what I mean by it is the way people are treating the virus - not just in that sense."
99,32,I like the movie. But I don't think that the fact that it's actually a joke makes it a joke. I'm gonna go see it anyways. I am gonna see it because it sounds so terrible and I'm not even gonna go to see it.
99,33,"Having a mask and a helmet helps a lot, but it irritates me that most people don't know what the whole idea of a mask is - he's supposed to be wearing a mask, but he doesn't have a mask and doesn't look like a clone in the same costume as the clown he's supposed to be wearing. Apparently you don't know if it's a joke or not if it's about the clone in a clone"
99,40,I see that this one is coming up at the end. I would love to see it.
99,48,The whole point of a clone is to get clones in place in order to get those people sick (which you probably already know).
99,58,The movie was a great movie.
99,63,I'm really trying to figure out what you mean by 'I like this movie'?
99,68,"I don't mean the joke itself, I mean the clone. I mean, people wear masks to stop the spread of the virus, because they are in the right place to do it and it has the right effect on people, and that's why it has a name: a ""silly"" joke."
99,81,"i have a feeling the title is being sexist, but I don't think it means ""because"" or ""because"""
99,93,>[I'm] looking to watch the movie
101,99,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
99,29,You should read the headline to see how the title is being used.
99,30,"I would think that if I had a chance to see the movie, I would have already been interested. I would have listened to the other two lines."
99,32,"I mean, the actual joke is about a clone. The joke is about how he gets the virus. It sounds like a joke because the clone has an effect on people, but it sounds like a joke because of the way the mask is named."
99,33,It's a joke because it is a joke and the title makes it sound like it's a joke and the title makes it sound like it's a joke because the title is so obvious.
99,40,"I didn't want to make a joke about the clone. It was made up, and it's a joke. The problem is that it's very much a joke. It doesn't need a mask for Christmas, it's a joke because it's a joke."
99,48,"I think people are being sexist. The whole point of a clone is to stop a virus from spreading and to treat it so well. I don't even think it's funny because people do it for the moral gratification of saying ""I'm sure there is a way to stop it"" - this has been done before in my area."
99,58,It's a joke because it's a joke. It's a joke because it's funny because it's a joke.
99,63,"The film was really good. The first movie I saw was about an Atheist who's a scumbag who thinks it's funny because he has a clone and a clone's mask, and when he does that, he's a huge fan of that movie, and I am convinced that he actually likes it and likes the costumes."
99,68,It's actually a joke because it's about the humor and not the fact it's a joke about a joke about a joke about a joke.
99,81,Because I'm a clown. I don't like the title. 'I don't understand what it means.

99,30,"It's actually a joke, because it's an explanation of how people are treating the virus."
99,32,It makes more sense to me if I don't like it more than if I just liked it. I think the idea of a joke that it would be a joke makes it less funny. I really think that the whole idea is kind of like a sexist joke and that is what it's about.
99,33,"If the title of this was a joke, it would be a joke."
99,40,They're in the same genre of humor as you do. You can only be a clone who makes a joke about someone. It is a joke about something you've consciously made up and can make a joke about.
99,48,The joke you are trying to get across is so terribly wrong.
99,58,This sub has a lot of humor in it. I can't believe it's made up.
99,63,The way the film ends it seems to me that it's actually a joke. The fact that they are all attracted to the clone makes them seem like they're making a good joke.

99,40,"The movie's about a clone supposedly wearing a clone to disguise a sick animal in order to get it cloned so he can have a fun night out, but there's not a whole lot of sex in it and I don't see how it could really be a joke."
99,48,"YES! And yet, even though it was actually a joke it is still a joke. This hasn't actually happened yet."

99,63,I think a lot of this joke is sexist.
99,68,i think we need a new word for that. but i don't think people are interested to know why we need a new word. what are you trying to say? i don't think there is a better word for that. but it's something the movie relates to
