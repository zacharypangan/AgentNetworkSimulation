76,58,The CDC has already endorsed wearing a mask against the spread of a virus.
76,65,If you can't imagine the discomfort of being in the hospital if you have it and then have to look at a medical shield you can't imagine the pain of being in an untreated condition.
76,66,"I'm a health professional. I didn't have a medical shield on when I was sick, and I'm no doctor. What I do know is that I can't put in my mask because it's infected and that's a really bad idea."
78,76,I think you are implying that people wear masks to prevent the spread of the virus and I think that you should just don't wear a mask.
88,76,It sounds like there is a very small chance that someone with HIV or even a HIV patient would end up with the virus. It would be a good idea to inform your family or anyone there that you will be infected or not have HIV.

76,8,No. The CDC isn't even a cliche. They're just an oversight organization that tries to do more than they are willing to do. That doesn't mean they don't want to be trusted.
76,15,CDC endorsed a mask against the spread of the virus.
76,18,"CDC. In an interview I have with the CDC, one of the first times we have been in a situation where people have been unable to handle or adapt to vaccinations, we're often told that this is one of the things they have to do if we are to stop the spread. We do know how to prevent the spread, we will just be waiting for them to change their rules."
76,19,"The masks aren't a great idea for people to wear unless you want to get vaccinated. Vaccination is just that. If you're not vaccinated, and you want the vaccine, then you will have to go to a doctor who does this."
76,35,"I've read a lot of interesting stuff about the CDC and HIV vaccines. They think wearing a mask will help stop the spread of a virus, but they don't want to get the chance of getting the vaccine that won't spread. What kind of fun is that?"

76,65,You can't tell me what's the point of a mask?
76,66,"I'm afraid I'm not sure what they want you to think. I don't know much about the science behind this, but what they really want is to put a mask on so the virus doesn't spread."
78,76,I'm not a doctor but I work at a hospital and I do not wear a mask.
88,76,I don't see how you're getting downvoted. This is a really dumb joke.
101,76,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
76,3,They have nothing to do with you!
76,8,"What's the actual reason? It sounds like people who aren't vaccinated for HIV have the same problems as those who have not, but it seems like there is a bit of a conspiracy, so it's not really a question of why, but what would they be doing if they got vaccinated for HIV?"
76,15,"People with HIV are using it to protect them from their HIV, not their disease."
76,18,"There's a lot of good advice here. If you're using the CDC as an example, I recommend checking the CDC website to see if they are willing to make an effort to help you prevent the spread of the virus. The vaccine is so bad, it's useless. It's all the CDC has to do."

76,58,It's more like he's asking his wife about her husband's experience and he tells her they think the same thing and she wants to get it done. She says he is a guy he's gonna take to a hospital because he's not a doctor but he doesn't care about the virus.
76,65,I would wear a mask if my husband would have to get vaccinated for a virus.
76,66,[RAINFUL](http://www.sunflowerhealth.org/publication/Final_Facil/Denver_Vise/Visit_Waiting_Making](http://www.unwashed-health.org/publications/Visit-Visiting/Visit-Visit-Visit-Visit-Visit) is a really good TED Talk I've had in my entire life.
78,76,Vaccines are for life. But there are other things you can do in the United States that help. Vaccines are for life.
88,76,"It's a joke, and it's part of the government's job."
101,76,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
76,3,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
76,8,"I think it's a bit of a misunderstanding to say that this kind of a thing isn't a thing. But, if I were you, I would go for it. I would get a good medical record of everything so I'd be able to get it from someone who was in a similar position."
76,15,"I'm afraid I'm not gonna get a big answer if I can't read the rest of this: the CDC endorses a mask, and they say it's useless, and that's the entire point of that."
76,18,"Is there anything in the article stating that a mask would not stop people with HIV from getting their vaccine, or is there anything in any way suggesting that the CDC needs to do something about it?"
76,19,"This was a very short and direct reply to the very end of your comment. It’s probably a bit off putting, but it’s really, really good. It's probably a good idea for people to wear a mask that helps prevent a virus from spreading, but it’s useless to do unless someone really wants to do it."
76,35,"I'd gotta put on a mask, but I don't want my husband to have to be vaccinated. I know the benefits to it, I know they will be a burden on the patient, but what's more important is that we all get it and it's good for everyone. And yes, if you want a better life you need a mask, you should wear one. But I guess you need a lot more than you can afford, so this is going to make your job tough."
76,39,So you don't know how to get off the street? That is so much better than a mask.
76,52,"I feel like you've been to the ""Visit-Visiting"" part of a pretty well-researched conversation in a lot of the things that are being cited."
76,58,A lot of the CDC's coverage isn't based on the actual symptoms. But the vaccine was released in 1995.
76,65,"I can understand the issue with the CDC, but I believe that it is to prevent the spread of HIV through some of the most basic retribution mechanism that has ever been found."
76,66,CDC is part of the Government's job. This is NOT what it's about.
78,76,No. Vaccines are for life. They're for everyone. You need to be vaccinated.
88,76,You mean like it is about preventing the spread of the virus and not trying to stop it in your body? That's a joke
101,76,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
76,3,This is a bit off putting.
76,8,"Vaccines are for life. They're for everyone. You need to be vaccinated. You mean like it is about preventing the spread of the virus and not trying to stop it in your body? That's a joke Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
76,15,"Its not a joke, it’s a statement and it’s a good one."
76,18,That doesn't make sense. This isn't the kind of thing that you get in a doctor's office. The only person you can get to put on a mask is your doctor and you need to get them to send a mail to them. Is that what you want?
76,19,"A ""Survey to get an HIV"" type of medicine is a very dangerous thing, so it's a good idea not to let it be skewed toward a single virus that could spread to more people, it's not really a good idea."
76,35,It's a joke. It's not about the vaccines but preventing the spread of the virus.

76,52,"I can understand this kind of conversation. But it’s not about a mask. It’s about a preventative vaccine that prevents HIV from spreading, because if you don’t think it’s a good idea to wear a mask, then you’re going to have to wear a mask, and instead you’re going to get a vaccine."
76,58,"I'm really interested to hear more about this... What a very stupid, shitty, ill informed comment."
76,65,"They aren't even about stopping the spread of the virus, they are about the prevention of the disease that you will be in a position to protect."

76,15,Because it's a bad idea to prevent the spread of a virus.
76,18,This is the first time I've ever heard someone say that it is about a vaccine.
76,19,"It seems like there are so many different ways for people to get their vaccines, but I am more interested in the general discussion and the debate itself."
76,35,"Well, I have a bunch of stuff that I have to explain. I think the reason it's so cliche is because the ""wars"" we get when we're sick (like the one about vaccines) are purely based on the actual disease. And I just don't really think this is any good."
76,39,I was shocked when I heard that the CDC is denying the Vaccine.
76,52,I like to think this is about the people who have the virus and are really curious about the treatment and benefits of the vaccine. But I really don't think the public would like it if they didn't get it and they couldn't possibly be able to take advantage of it.
76,58,I like to believe that vaccinating your wife is a good way to prevent HIV.
76,65,Vaccines are for everyone. You need to be vaccinated.
76,66,"If the CDC was supposed to stop the spread of HIV, I think the CDC should make sure it's not about a viral disease."
78,76,I don't see the issue.

76,18,"It's not about the vaccine, it's about the treatment of the disease."
76,19,"Vaccines are not for everyone, you don't need a mask to get the vaccine."

76,65,"It's a very sad, unproductive cliche to say ""as a person who has no control over HIV, you need to be patient. You are the one who needs to be vaccinated."""
76,66,"As a fellow health professional, I am concerned about the stigma attached to vaccinating. Is it a real, genuine, universal concern that the CDC is not able to prevent the spread of HIV?"
78,76,I would like to add that you need to look up to how you can prevent the spread of a disease without looking down at any actual evidence. It sounds like a simple joke and not a joke.
88,76,"There is no joke here. 'Cannonanwer -', ""I don't see how you're getting downvoted. This is a really dumb joke."
101,76,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
76,3,"Yes, they are very necessary for people with HIV who have no control over the virus. The way they are doing things is very important."
76,8,"I have a friend who has a vaccine that prevents HIV from being spread. He's at the hospital and gets to see a doctor. He does not get the vaccine, but she has a vaccinated wife who is in the ER. He was vaccinated because his wife had the virus on her arm but hasn't been vaccinated for the entire time he's been there. He's been in the hospital for a week after her ebola. He hasn't had a case with his wife for years and I'"
76,15,It sounds like the joke is to help people with HIV stop AIDS.
76,18,"I'm not saying that I like to think he's being cliche, but what he's saying is that the CDC doesn't have the authority to make a law against the spread of the virus. I mean, they do have the power to stop the spread of the virus. This is the most recent of many cliches that seem to have surfaced since the beginning of time. You're the one who is being cliche."
76,19,The CDC is also a major contributor to the spread of HIV in the US. It is a big concern. It seems like the vaccines are the only vaccine available.
76,35,They are talking about preventing the spread of HIV and vaccines. The problem is they are not reducing the risk and so the CDC is preventing the spread. It's not just about the virus but the treatment of the disease.

76,52,"“I have been in a lot of dangerous situations and the first thing that compelled me to wear a mask was to get sick.

I don’t think it will help me because I am a healthy person,” [each](http://www.dcc.gov/hp/hpp/hpp/Hp/hp.hp/hp"
76,58,"I'd rather see your wife, if I can't find her, get vaccinated, or get someone who can be trusted by doctors to fight the virus."
76,65,This is the only part of this AMA I can post with complete confidence : I'm a healthcare professional and have had many years of experience with this disease and was skeptical of it being related to the CDC's anti-HIV program. I can say that I feel very bad for my wife because she's too young and I can't take the disease with me. I am really unsure of her own health and I am not sure of her. I would not agree with her because she was diagnosed with HIV and my family did not believe her vaccine was actually a good idea.
76,66,There is a very good reason to believe that if you do get it you will have the benefit of being vaccinated.

76,66,I don't think there's anything bad in the comments that could be said about this. I think the CDC should be able to make it a much better public health program.
78,76,"I have never worn a mask, but I know my colleagues who do. There are many people I know who wear a mask because they feel that they aren't going to be vaccinated for anything."
88,76,It's the CDC and the people who make a joke about it.
101,76,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."

It's common to say ""you are cliche"" when you're talking about cliches. It doesn't even have a point of view of the word because it doesn't"
76,19,"Vaccines are an important part of the overall health care program, so there is a lot of work to be done. I guess a mask is a good idea, but not always practical, it's the most beneficial."

76,39,I have a lot of people who say that the CDC is being cliched. I know I've heard a lot of stupid shit. Is there anything that CDC doesn't tell you? The CDC sucks.
76,52,You are cliche. Your wife and I have had two separate conversations about how we're doing this. It is cliche.
76,58,I feel like the CDC would be more helpful to me to reassure her that she would have a good time after it was vaccinated. Then they would want to make sure she was vaccinated and be in a position to take advantage of the new opportunities.
76,65,"If you don't know how to explain the idea, you're going to have to get a new one."
76,66,I think that this is one of the reasons that CDC is so bad. I think it's a shame that people are being so incredibly negative about a virus.
78,76,"I don't think you're being harsh, but your point is valid."

76,8,You mean like it is about preventing the spread of the virus and not trying to stop it in your body?
76,15,Is it not a joke? I don't understand.
76,18,So you think this is being a political thing? We're not. What's the point of it? The people that make this stuff.
76,19,You know I think your comment is misleading and that this is what the CDC wants you to think.
76,35,They're not able to reduce the risk of getting the vaccine that won't spread.
76,39,"I am really happy that the CDC has been giving more people vaccinated to prevent the spread of the virus - and I agree, I think they need to go to the CDC and tell them what the problem is.

88,76,I don't understand why a joke is a joke. Is it because the CDC isn't working to stop AIDS? The only people I know who are using it are people who do not have AIDS.
101,76,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
76,3,I am not sure what you are trying to tell me. I'm just joking. I don't have a very specific opinion and I do not think there's really a need to get vaccinated against HIV. But I think it is a good idea to put a mask on to protect you from getting it.
76,8,You have a right to not be taken out by a virus that is not present on the outside of the genitals? Is there any reason to believe you could have the virus and be vaccinated by now? Does there exist any reason to believe that that is true?
76,15,"CANNOTANSWER: [I grew up with the disease and the mask and the AIDS epidemic in the states](https://www.health.org/health-care-resources/). The CDC says there is a difference between a mask and a vaccine, and a mask doesn't help."

I got a little sick from the trip, and that was the first time I've been to a doctor for four years. I'm not convinced a vaccinated person is even a doctor if they don't have some disease."

76,15,"I don't have any experience with this, but I know that the purpose of wearing a mask is not to prevent the spread of the virus, but to prevent the spread. The mask is also supposed to help prevent the spread of the virus, which is not the same as in the UK."

76,8,I can tell you I think the CDC's job as the most reputable agency for vaccinations is to keep the public health informed on the status and effectiveness of the vaccines and to help prevent the spread of HIV.
76,15,They should start putting a face around your mouth. It's an excellent way to let the doctor know you don't have a symptom.
76,18,"What about ""I don't know if I'm being a cliche""?"
76,19,It's kind of funny. I had a symptom of HIV and had to leave my job to find a new vaccination program. After that I went and found a different clinic and a new doctor. We got the same results and it worked!
76,35,The problem is they are not able to reduce the risk of getting the vaccine that won't spread.

Vaccines are for everybody. Vaccines are for everyone. Vaccines are for everyone. Vaccines are for everyone. Vaccines are for everyone. People need to be vaccinated, but not for any other sex."

76,58,You need to learn how to handle it. It's not that you're being harsh.
76,65,You're not being a dick. I'm not even a doctor and I don't need a job. I have a job and I feel like I'm being a dick. I'm just being honest.
76,66,It sounds like a good idea - you should see a doctor first.

76,15,Is there a reason not to wear a mask when you don't have an infection?
76,18,"The CDC is making a lot of good and good decisions about what is and isn't a political issue. They can't do that, but it is a good idea for them."
76,19,"The article says they were ""totally a joke""."
76,35,I can't think of a good reason that would make you want to get vaccinated. There's more to this than a good reason.
76,39,"It is a joke. A joke, in the sense that a joke can help, and it doesn't hurt if you use it in a joke. But what you're joking isn't the right word to use, it's what the CDC's policy should be – people will ask them to stop - so if they do, they can make the jokes better, and the CDC can do the same."
76,52,"There are no examples of a good person being patient when they have no control of their disease and if their response is 'I don't think it's a good idea', then they aren't the CDC."
76,58,It's not about the CDC in itself. It's a joke. I don't agree with it and I think that's very true.

76,8,"If they really want to help, they're going to help them. It's going to stop it. It's going to help the patient because it's more effective than just the vaccination itself."
76,15,I can't believe the CDC is so much into a joke as a joke. AIDS is the real thing.
76,18,"I'm just gonna try and be blunt with you - I've never had an infection, and I can't be too sure about anything. Besides, I'm not a doctor. I'm just trying to be honest. I just want to say I feel like I'm being a dick."

76,58,I think it's just a joke. It's not just a joke.
76,65,It's a joke because I don't like being an ad.
76,66,I read that the CDC was the only agency to have a mandate of vaccination for certain people who had AIDS. That's like saying we are allowed to vaccinate everyone and that we shouldn't put on masks when we're sick.
78,76,It’s a joke based on a book.
88,76,It seems that the joke is about the government and not the CDC. I think it would be a funny joke if people didn't understand what the joke means.

76,15,CDC has an article about this because there isn't even a joke about the AIDS vaccine. That article has several sarcastic comments including:
76,18,"The CDC was the one that pushed for the 'Bring a mask', which means you get the vaccine asap. A good one would be an ""Assuming you can get it for free on medcd."" It was a joke as well. The ""What about ""I don't know if I'm being a cliche"" is the reason people use it in the first place. Whether or not the CDC is going to put on a mask in public is another cliche. That's why they have been in the last"
76,19,"I think they're referring to the government in this case as the ""advisory body building "". They say it's a joke."
76,35,The government is just the one.

76,52,"I am a huge fan of AIDS and am trying to spread awareness for the virus. But I cannot even put on a mask or anything in my life that doesn't stop you from getting it. I don't think it's a joke, but I think it is a good idea. It's a joke."
76,58,The CDC has a duty to protect AIDS in our country. You don't need to have a doctor to vaccinate someone if they don't have a bacterial infection or get a rash. They can prevent a number of other diseases.
76,65,This is not a joke. This is a joke.
76,66,It is a joke based on a book. It seems that the joke is about the government and not the CDC.
78,76,"""The government is a bad tool. I think that you should just don't wear a mask."""

101,76,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."

76,8,"And yet, I always feel like the best place to start is to call the doctor (and the family) and tell them to go. Because, for some reason, he's getting so sick he hasn't been vaccinated yet."

I've also been through the same thing, though I've never used a mask. There are lots of good cliches on a couple of things."
76,18,"It's a joke, and a joke."
76,19,"I'm being cliche. This is not a joke, it's just the government being a joke."
76,35,"A guy I worked with in college had a lot of misconceptions about vaccines that he thought the government was just an organization that wanted people to get the vaccine and he was scared to have to go through the CDC. He actually said he wanted to go through the CDC on a large scale, and they didn't want to put on masks. I think he's being silly."
76,39,People do not know what a mask is. They just want people to have a second chance.

78,76,"Considering that there are a lot of people who have not yet developed a form of AIDS, it sounds like this is a funny post on this sub."
88,76,What do you think of the idea of a CDC 'joke'?
101,76,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
76,3,It's the opposite of a joke. It's a joke. And it's not about you being a politician. It's about the CIA being a bad tool and they aren't even in the right to do that. It's not about the government - they're not in the right to do that. I have the same issue as someone who was in my position and wanted to be in the position to make a joke about his lack of knowledge of vaccines.
76,8,"So a doctor just got vaccinated, with the help of a mask, when he couldn't get a vaccine. What a joke."
76,15,"I don't have a question. It's about the health of all people who live in our country. It's about the health of your family, not the government. It's about what people say. It's also about the way they feel about people's health and what things people need. You need to respect the people in your life who are the ones who care. You have a life.

76,18,"I see. They're the ones who have the biggest problem with the government's attempts to change policies. It's not that they're trying to prevent it, it's that it's not that they're doing the right thing to stop it. It's just not true and I don't see the point in them changing policies or changing policy."
76,19,"This is the third time I've ever had an episode of Dr. Fucks for the first time since the first episode of The Wire starring Michael Bay. I'm blown away. The first episode, at least, is like a week before it comes out. It's the only episode. Mostly because it is about a guy and a guy doing this shit to his girlfriend. But it is still a comedy.

It is extremely interesting to hear some of the people who have been in the healthcare field, including some from the CDC, who've already been vaccinated and have had a number of times."
76,66,I'd like to add that you are a medical professional and don't want to hear a lot of comments promoting the government as a joke about it.
78,76,Then I woke up after eating a meal. It was a prank that wasn't funny at all.
88,76,"It’s a good idea to go to a doctor to make sure you don’t get swine flu and then you get the CDC to come down in on you. But when CDC comes around it’s a joke about the CDC and if you’re not ill or have a bad swine flu, then you’re on the wrong subreddit."

76,19,The CDC is the joke. This is not the first time they've heard of this.
76,35,I think he's referring to an AIDS-related illness that is not very dangerous. The idea of a vaccine and people having to get it is misleading.

78,76,I have been going on the internet all day. This is one of those stories that I can't recall reading. I just think it's a pretty silly and ridiculous joke.
88,76,I don't want to be the asshole. I want to be the sexiest man alive.
101,76,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
76,3,I'm just saying that I am going to go with this quote.
76,8,It is a joke to try to prevent the spread of the virus by having the vaccine on the other person and you want to be vaccinated for the virus and it’s a fucking cliche to get them to do it in the first place.
76,15,What's going on here? It's not a joke. It's a nonsense. It's a joke. But it's a joke.
76,18,"It's a joke, right? It's a joke, a joke."
76,19,There are literally hundreds of things that would prevent a sexism or HIV from spreading. I'm not going to come off as a prick for this. I'm going to go off into the cold with this stuff. It's not like the CDC is even going to slander you just because you're a pedant.
76,35,"I've had a rash of the virus because I had to go to a hospital. I've had it since I was a child. My parents were all vaccinated, my dad's parents were all hospitalized for it. During that time, we had a rash of the virus and all they could tell us was they wouldn't take that shit anymore."
76,39,“It’s a joke.

78,76,So... are you sure the CDC isn't ripping off a book that says what it is about?

78,76,I'd like to add that you need to look up to how you can prevent the spread of a disease without looking down at any actual evidence. It sounds like a joke. It's a joke because it's based on a book.
88,76,I think people need to take the time to read this as it is actually a serious joke. I think people are missing the point. It's not a joke but it does have some merit.

76,18,I think it's a joke. You're being a dick.
76,19,Vaccines are also for the entire population.
76,35,There are some very very simple things in the CDC that are really important to me.
76,39,"I read a lot of this. It is the worst. The only thing that matters is that, like a virus, you can't stop it."
76,52,"""We are not just the CDC. They are not just the CDC. They are the gov't. They are the gov't. They are the gov't. They are the gov't. They are the gov't."""

76,66,i think you're just joking.

88,76,"I feel as though you are actually joking. I'm saying that the point of this subreddit is to see if any of the people posting are actually being helpful to the conversation, not just to discuss the issue."
101,76,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
76,3,The CDC is a good organisation. They’re just a bad tool for this.
76,8,"It has to do with the fact that a person is being a cliche. The fact that this is a joke makes me question whether they would want to be a cliche, or if the CDC is a bad one because they're a bad organization."

76,18,"The only way to stop the spread of the virus is if you wear a mask, but you have to get it. You don't have to put on a mask in public. You don't have to have to be a doctor to get it for free, because you are sick."
76,19,"The CDC isn't a joke, just a joke."
76,35,"In a few days you could be like: ""I think they are just a little misinformed."
76,39,"If someone is being a joke, it means that if they say it's too bad, it doesn't work. Vaccines aren't for everyone. I'd be surprised if there was even a joke about that."
76,52,"As a former patient I'm sure there are some good people out there who wear masks, but I also find it very easy to think of people being sick or in a state where they don't want to be infected, so it doesn't matter if they wear a mask."
76,58,This is a joke. I think you need to learn how to handle it.
76,65,A CDC employee was a great doc who didn't like having to get the HIV vaccine. It was actually pretty good at the CDC. It's a lot of people who didn't like that - i.e. the AIDS vaccine.
76,66,"I think that this TED talk is hilarious because it says, ""This is a joke because I don't know how to explain the idea, but I don't want to be an asshole to anyone who thinks that people are being a joke because they're not a doctor or a doctor. I think that this is something that should be discussed with me about."""
78,76,"I mean, they jumped to the same conclusion. We are going to have to start a medical emergency and take steps to prevent this. We need to make it to the end of the patient, and we will continue to help this patient. If we start bringing the disease up again then we can make sure it's at least a good idea."
88,76,I was just talking about this as the only time I've had a conversation on Reddit that seemed like it would be a good way to end it.
101,76,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
76,3,"I haven't seen one, but that's not one I can't get a grip on."
76,8,You're not being a joke. You're being an oversight organization. They're just a bad tool for this. It has to do with the fact that a person is being a joke.
76,15,"I'd like to point out that it's a joke because people are putting off vaccinations in the first place. In my experience, vaccinations aren't a joke, but it would just be annoying for people to get sick or worse. Honestly, it's a joke, but it doesn't sound like it's intended to be a joke. And it does sound a little gross, but I can see that being a joke is one thing and it's a joke. There is one way to prevent it to stop the spread of a virus."
76,18,"A lot of people are referring to it as the only way to prevent infection, but it is just another term."
76,19,AIDS is a real illness and the CDC isn't going to get rid of it by offering an expensive vaccine for people who can't afford it.
76,35,"The point of this sub is to see if any of the people posting are actually being helpful to the conversation, not just to discuss the issue."
76,39,"There is a very real problem in Canada. What you see is not that he has an allergy, but he does have a problem with the lack of vaccines. It's that he has not been able to get an allergy, but that he has the HIV, and that it doesn't need vaccines to be infected, so it is not very good advice."
76,52,"> ""I don't know how to explain the idea, but I do have to be patient. You do have to wear it, or you don't."""
76,58,"It's like the CDC and the CDC. We are more than willing to pay to have a person come in and check into the house to get a vaccinated and a vaccine - but in the end we're not going to have the time of our lives to deal with a serious epidemic, which is just not happening. There are no laws against people from going in to a medical facility, or even taking their kids to a doctor, because of a sick child."
76,65,It's not that they're being cliched. I think it's just how they are.
76,66,I can see that your family is getting sick at a young age. I was sick when they started getting the vaccine.
78,76,I think that they are a joke in a similar manner.
88,76,IANAL. This joke is so wildly wrong that it sucks.
101,76,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
76,3,"The point of the article is to help people and organizations stop the spread of the virus.

A CDC employee was a great doc who didn't get the AIDS vaccine."
76,8,I'd like to point out that this is a joke because a person is being a joke. I think it's a joke because they're not interested in the idea.
76,15,"Thats the one, the one that’s been left in my head for the last year."
76,18,"This sounds like a very reasonable reason for a joke. Its not a dick joke, it's just an excuse for a joke. I can imagine a CDC employee joking about something like this. Its ridiculous. They make a lot of stupid jokes about it because of the government. CDC is just a little bit of a hypocrite, but they are making it ridiculous because people like him are getting sick. That's why they're so cruel, like I said."
76,19,"A CDC employee did an interview about this and the CDC is taking an ass off in a funny tone and it sounds a bit weird but then again it seems a little weird. A CDC employee also did an interview about the health benefits of the vaccine, and was not being very kind to him, and it sounds like the government is a joke."
76,35,"I can't understand what you're referring to. If you're trying to think of it as an ""as I'm concerned"" joke, I'd say ""A lot of people don't know what is going on"", or ""but I know I can't think of a reason to get the vaccine that won't spread."""
76,39,"It's a joke, but they ain't the right tool."
76,52,"People who don't get HIV get HIV only when their family is sick. It's like getting a sick adolescent to get AIDS for their kids. Those kids are sick, and the people who don't get HIV from their parents are sick. People who get AIDS are sick. They are sick. If we don't treat them, they're sick, they're sick. AIDS isn't for everyone."
76,58,"""Hey.. I'm going to put up with this and make it into a series of jokes where I tell people that we need to have a conversation about a vaccine, and then I just like it if they don't go to the hospital. It's not a joke."""

101,76,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."

76,39,There are two big problems with the CDC:
76,52,"That is a very interesting concept, the point is that it's so bad that the reason they aren't allowing the vaccine to come into effect is because you are not aware of your own health and therefore do not know what it means. It's just as bad as being infected with the virus in your own health and it's actually just really bad if you don't know what the virus means."
76,58,I'm just getting to the point where I'm not a huge fan of rebuttals. I'm a fan of a lot of rebuttals and it's been a while.

76,35,Vaccines aren't going to help with the spread of viruses. It just has to prevent the spread of many diseases. There's more to the problem than you might think.
76,39,Vaccines are not a joke. There is a lot of science behind them and the CDC doesn't really like it. If you can't do it without getting vaccinated you need a vaccination to stop it. If you aren't doing it yourself you are being too cold and you are being too ill to do it. You are a poor person and that makes you a poor person.

76,35,I stayed in one of the CDC offices for almost six months. I was a doctor from the CDC. It seems like I stayed in one of the most respected positions to get a vaccinated person. It's not really a joke because it's just a cliche.
76,39,The first line makes me feel weird and that I need to start asking myself if I am being a joke. But this makes sense a lot.
76,52,They are not allowed to refuse a vaccine. But they have no legal obligation to refuse a vaccine and are allowed to refuse an AMA.
76,58,Vaccines are not a joke. They're a tool.
76,65,People who disagree with the CDC aren't being cliched. The CDC isn't the one that has to say the joke because that's all they are telling you. I think that's not exactly the proper answer. The CDC does need to be clear that the joke is a joke.
76,66,"This is an interesting story, because the idea is a joke, and the idea of a joke is a joke. It's a joke because people think it is a joke, and the whole thing is a joke because it's a joke."
78,76,"I don't know the specific definition of the word ""juke"". It's based off of a book by John F. Kennedy."

101,76,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
76,3,I'm in a position where I have a lot of responsibility.

It was really simple: ""I think that a woman who has not been vaccinated for ebola needs to be vaccinated. ''It's not a joke. It's not a joke. The CDC has no legal obligation to refuse an AMA."
76,15,... And they do not need to be honest.

76,19,"It's all in the name of the humor. If the humor isn't what it's supposed to be, I don't think it's going to be."
76,35,What's the joke if someone told me that the CDC is trying to prevent spread of AIDS? They are not.
76,39,"I know a little about vaccines and they aren't universally endorsed, but I think that the CDC, and the CDC as a whole, can do a very good job with that. The government can't just ignore them when they are being criticized. There are many things that need to be done."
76,52,"Having a doctor make me sick so that I can wear masks for whatever reason, I need to do it."
76,58,"A vaccine and a mask is not a joke unless you're describing the disease and you're trying to get vaccinated. If you don't get the vaccine, you should contact the CDC and make a complaint to the CDC."
76,65,I think that's what is making it seem like they're just playing tricks.
76,66,"The CDC has a legitimate obligation to prevent HIV because it's a medical thing, not because they want to prevent the spread of it."
78,76,The first one is a joke and the second one is the most important one.
88,76,I'm a doctor and I don't understand the whole joke. It's a joke because I don't understand why people would be offended.
101,76,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
76,3,This isn't the right joke. It's the right joke.
76,8,"It was a joke, and a joke because it was based on a book. The people who said it are being offended. Its a joke because the joke is based on the fact that the CDC has no obligation to fix the problem. The government can't just ignore them when they are being criticized."
76,15,"There is a lot of common sense about HIV, but I don't believe that it is one of those people who has had the same symptoms. That's why it's a joke."
76,18,They're also promoting the idea of an AIDS vaccine and getting rid of it.
76,19,I can relate to that. A simple question about the CDC is the idea of a vaccine. It is for a serious problem and therefore is a joke that will be taken seriously. It is also a joke because people have to learn about it and learn from it. So it isn't that joke that has to be said. The reason that it isn't a joke is that it is a joke.
76,35,"The vaccine is supposed to be about preventing the spread of viruses. And if you don't get it, you can't get it."
76,39,"So you can read that and say ""I'm not sure if you're being a dick at all, but a bit of a joke."""
76,52,"It's funny, you say this in context to describe why the CDC refuses to do something because the CDC has no obligation to do it. The CDC and the CDC as a whole, can do a very good job fixing the problem."

76,19,"As a health care professional, I think it's funny and it's not a joke that's being made up. I think it's the right joke because it's a joke because the CDC has a legitimate obligation to prevent the spread of the virus."
76,35,People are so pissed when they hear it. The CDC is doing a great job at it and doesn’t have to do anything about it
76,39,Is this really a joke? That's the part I don't think there's enough 'I don't know what a mask is' that should be discussed and decided on?
76,52,I think that's a joke. You just say that.
76,58,No one cares if this is a joke - they want you to get it. Vaccines are the way to go for HIV!
76,65,This is not a joke.
76,66,"I think if the CDC actually did go back to a vaccination program for everyone, they would have changed. As it relates to the CDC, there is a very real difference between the two - it's the vaccine and the CDC. There is no difference between a joke and a joke."
78,76,"A lot of people who know the'real' AIDS AMA are going to be more comfortable to say that a medical emergency is a joke. The AMA is not based off the book. You have to show that there is a story about a doctor who is working at a hospital. Those things are called 'jukes' because a doctor is in the audience. But a joke is about the government because it's based off the book, and the movie is based off of it."
88,76,"There's also a joke about how people use a mask when they're fucking around in public, when they're infected and not who's infected."
101,76,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
76,3,A joke is a joke. But a joke is a joke.
76,8,It's also the best way to prevent the spread of AIDS.
76,15,"'This article'' is pretty apt, as it relates to the fact that the CDC is taking actions to help prevent the spread of the virus."
76,18,"This is a 'dick joke'. You're talking about a cliche, not a joke. That's exactly what I'm talking about."

76,39,"CANNOTANSWER: ""The article was written by [Eric Yin, CDC Commissioner of Health for the Federal Bureau of AIDS, [http://www.cdc.gov/statutes/viruses.htm](https://www.cdc.gov/statutes/viruses.htm)"
76,52,"Alot of people are just being honest and being truthful about how their 'I don't know what a mask is' joke, and how they're the government is doing it."
76,58,There isn't a joke that doesn't involve the CDC in the joke.
76,65,"I've been told by several people that the idea of a mask on is a joke, but you don't have to be a doctor to have a job. In fact, the article explains why it is a joke. There is a lot of misconceptions about the CDC. I'm not a doctor, but I've had many years of experience in the CDC's anti-HIV program. It's a joke because people don't know the CDC's responsibilities, they do. Hence, I just want to go out on"

78,76,"It sounds like a lot of people would be embarrassed to have to go on a flight to a doctor's office to get vaccinated, but then they would be embarrassed to have to go on a health trip. That's why it's called a ""jake"" because a guy who has AIDS has never been in the hospital before has AIDS. I'm not sure if that is appropriate. But I know it's funny that there is a story about it."
