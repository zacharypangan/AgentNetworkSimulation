62,59,What a fun day!
81,62,I used to be a child with a medical condition called covi - he was able to come home with a sandwich and we did the same thing.
82,62,I think we would benefit from a mask or helmet that would protect against corona and that people would have to wear to go outside for a month or that would allow us to open up the economy again.
93,62,i think there s a lot of people that wear masks on a daily basis and its hard to imagine not having a run.
98,62,"People like wearing a mask, because there is a virus on there, but it isn't effective."
62,16,I've been trying to read the whole thing but that's what I was describing.
62,59,People wear a mask.
81,62,"As a kid I did that with my mom, and I had a terrible tinnitus a few years back."
82,62,"I have a fecal problem. I would say 'Cause I have an emergency'' If you have an emergency, I would say 'Cause I have an emergency'' If people can't make eye contact with their skin won't realize what a danger the fecal matter is. Wearing a mask is not an actual disease. Wearing a mask or wearing a helmet would save lives."
93,62,The santa is probably wearing a mask too. There is a lot of information about santas on the internet about them.
98,62,"I have an eye apnea and have noticed a difference. I like to wear a mask to protect myself. I don't know if I need it or not, but I do like a bit of a lip on and nobody will be around to take care of me. I just don't know if it helps with my health because I can go out without it, but when I do it it's just to hide from whoever I am with or not. I wear a mask to protect my eyes a good night's sleep, a hat,"
62,16,Is it really just a mask? I just like having a facial mask on to protect myself.
62,59,This one. My uncle told me about this and I told him a secret. People wear a mask because there is a virus. Its not an actual disease. Wearing a mask or wearing a helmet would save lives. The santa is probably wearing a mask too.
81,62,"I would hate to see a video where Santa wears a mask. It's a big, scary thing. I'd love to see it too."
82,62,I think you might have a good idea of the main issue here:
93,62,"OP, 'You think there's a lot of people that wear a mask on a daily basis and its hard to imagine not having a run.', 'The santa is probably wearing a mask too. There is a lot of information about santas on the internet about them. ''"
98,62,"Is there a reason the government wants you to wear a mask? The most common reason is that your facial expression is too thin. The only reason you are wearing a mask is because your facial expression is too thin. That means your facial expression is a bit off, which is why it isn't appropriate. People don't essentially wear a mask, because they see people wearing a mask. That's not even really a funny thing to say, but it's still a joke. People don't like wearing a mask because of being unable to tell you"
62,16,"I can see the funny side of that. But I can’t be sure. I can’t see a real, unbiased, expert on a condition that I’m experiencing and I can’t figure out what’s going on. If you want to see a video where santa wears a mask. I can’t really imagine how many people would do that."
62,59,"I don't like it, but I wear a mask because I know a santa is in an emergency and it looks like they are faking a fake one, and I don't like the idea of the actual people that put themselves at risk daily (and the santa isn't)."
81,62,">A nefarious child is wearing a mask. It's a big, scary thing. I'd love to see it too. I want to know why this is so popular among kids... 'the government must have taken care of people with a mask to prevent the spread of a virus.'"
82,62,"You do know that this post is pretty cliched but it still doesn't really say anything that's true - it's a satire of the post. The government's job is to satire the needs of the public in general, so I'm not sure what's up with that."
93,62,"It's probably not the best joke you've ever heard. The jokes that everyone uses is about being taken advantage of, and not that you're not."
98,62,"I'm sorry, you're having such a bad day."
62,16,... and you're having a bad day.
62,59,I'm not the kind of person that doesn't get the joke. I'm more of a self -absorbed person that just wants to make sure people don't get sick. This isn't a joke. It's a joke.
81,62,A mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
82,62,"""Making a mask is a great way to stop people from getting sick. Wearing a mask or wearing a helmet would save lives."""
93,62,"It's not a joke, but it's a good one. You're not going to get sick, and if you're in a funk, you're going to suffer. If you aren't in a funk, it's going to be very hard to get sick. If it's a funk, then I don't see any reason for it to be a funk."
98,62,"It sounds like a fun joke. The government is going to wear it because it will stop the spread of the virus, so it's a joke."
62,16,Having a doctor who has a serious illness will likely help prevent them from getting sick. The government has made masks available to help people with a serious illness.
62,59,">The government is going to wear it because it will stop the spread of the virus, so it's a joke."
81,62,Is that why he's wearing a mask? I just don't understand how people use it when they feel a person is doing a wrong thing.
82,62,"I don't see the point of saying the fecal vaccine is not a health issue. It's a virus, and is not a medical thing. He isn't getting the message he's trying to give. That's all."
93,62,"I love the ""Mom"" movie a lot."
98,62,"What I hate most about this is that it sounds like the government was trying to help with a virus, not to stop it."
62,16,It seems like it's a joke.
62,59,"[The government is going to wear it because it will stop the spread of the virus, so it's a joke."
81,62,"I don't think there is enough evidence that people believe that a child is going to have an infection, but I do think that a child being exposed to a disease is a good example."
82,62,"The problem is that these kinds of things are being spread in some places, but that is an area of the government that has never done much to help. It's not about the'masked issue' but rather about whether or not you believe the government's job is to satire the needs of the public."
93,62,"I'm going to be honest. Almost all the posts in here have some blatant misquotes, and some of them are hilarious and kind of sad, so I'm not going to say it's a joke."
98,62,"""I don't know if I need it or not, but I do like a bit of a lip on and nobody will be around to take care of me.

62,16,"I mean, I hate this, but I am not trying to make fun of this at all. This isn't about the'masked issue', but rather, if you're genuinely uncomfortable, it's about the ""medical problem"". This isn't about that. It's more about the'medical problem'. I'm just saying that the government should be doing its job, not helping. But it also doesn't. This isn't about the'masked issue', which I don't really understand. I don't"
62,59,"The government is going to wear it because it will stop the spread of the virus, so it's a joke."
81,62,Until we reach the age of 23 and see the government take care of this and that's how I feel about my kids :-)
82,62,"The word ""fecal"" has been used in the past a number of ways."
93,62,"'I'm not a santa or a clown. I am not a santa or a clown. I don't like the way the movie ends, nor the characters, or the acting, but I think I am right about this."
98,62,"""Facial expression is too thin"""
62,16,You've been working hard to read the whole thing but that's what I was describing. But I can't really imagine how many people would do that.
62,59,It seems like this is an anti-virus film.
81,62,"I think the 'What if I'm sick of a virus' joke is pretty cool. Its like what happens when you don't know anyone, right?"
82,62,I think it's time to end the post. The president is a tad bit like a tad like an official or something.
93,62,The movie isn't funny. It's a ripoff of the book.
98,62,This is a really interesting thing to read.
62,16,"I mean, I like this movie and the movie a lot. What I hate most about this is that it sounds like the government was trying to help with a virus, not to stop it. It seems like it’s a joke."
62,59,"This is a great movie for my kids! It's one of those things I love to read. They say ""it's a joke."" But that's not how it's written. Definitely not a ""the government should be doing its job, not helping."" But they also say ""fecal"" when they're upset with a government action."
81,62,It's a joke because it's not snide because it's too easy to put an end to it.
82,62,"I'm just saying... I can't say that he wants to be a politician, but he wants to be the president. That's a great way to get him to reclaim the position, and he needs to be in charge of the govt. If he wants to have a govt. or a politician, and he wants to go to his office and not have to give them a warning, then he needs to be in charge."
93,62,This is a really funny post. I'd like to have a try.
98,62,"The government is not responsible for stopping the spread of a virus. The government is not responsible for making a joke, but the government isn't going to help stop it. It's the government's job to help prevent it from spreading."
62,16,"I think the government needs to get its act together to prevent a serious illness from spreading. But what is the point in that one? This isn't an anti-virus film, but it is an anti-viral one."
62,59,"I'm gonna say it. ""Fecal"" is a term used to describe the act of carrying a virus."
81,62,The last part is pretty hilarious.
82,62,I just thought he'd be a good guy. Is this what they're doing?
93,62,The best way to end it is to leave your mouth open.
98,62,It's not a joke. It's a joke.
62,16,"I didn’t mean to be harsh. I mean, hey I’m gonna go and read your post."
62,59,It's a bit funny because they seem to think it's a joke.
81,62,I'm sick of the title - 'what if I'm sick of a virus'.
82,62,I'm really excited about the fact that the president is getting in front of everyone. What he wants is to put people in a mask. It's a ridiculous thing to do.
93,62,The movie isn't funny. It's a rip off of the book.
98,62,It's all about being an asshole. The government isn't responsible for stopping the spread of the virus.
62,16,I’m so sick of it. I really wish I had a second opinion.
62,59,... I'm not the kind of person that doesn't get the joke. I'm more of a self -absorbed person that just wants to make sure people don't get sick.
81,62,As a kid I would think that any joke in the world would have been pretty good if they put on a mask to prevent people from getting sick.

93,62,"I am an American and I wear a mask every day. I like to eat, walk, drive, and drive to work every day because I am in a funk. I don't like how it ends, nor the characters, or the acting, but I think I am right about this."
98,62,"This is a really good thing, it's an uncalled for joke."
62,16,The slang term is 'cometa'.
62,59,"That's a good thing, but it's the part that just makes me feel a bit silly."
81,62,"People are joking about how people use the word ""joke"" in many countries, but the most widely accepted way to joking about what is considered a joke is because that is what it's about."
82,62,"You don't know the difference between a fecal problem and a fecal problem? I think it's a joke, oh my God, it's the fecal problem."
93,62,I'd have to say the best way to end it is to leave your mouth open.
98,62,There is a lot of stupidity in that sub. I am not sure what it is.
62,16,"I don’t know what the slang word is, but it might be related to the person who wrote it, which is probably the person who created the slang term."
62,59,I figured this might be an obvious way to say 'I am not the kind of person that doesn't get the joke. I just can't figure out what to do.'
81,62,That's the joke that I was going to make. The next word is a joke.
82,62,"This is the part of the story where the president tries to snitch away at a lot of people's concerns, and that is to stop people from getting sick. He does not do this, and it's a joke. He makes that out of a joke."
93,62,"My mother is very similar to you. She has been on the train for a while and the santa looks good, but she can't seem to get a std for it. She got out of that by accident."
98,62,"Then it's the government, or the government's job to stop the spread of a virus. That is the problem."
62,16,They are doing some really stupid shit. The slang word is 'cometa'.
62,59,"I like to eat, walk, drive, drive to work everyday because I am in a funk. I don't like the way it ends, nor the characters, or the acting, but I think I am right about this."
81,62,What if a child is wearing a mask in a school or a race. You go up to a party and you get a tinnitus?
82,62,"A fecal problem is a health issue. It's not a virus. It's a virus, and it is not a medical thing. He needs to be in charge of the government."
93,62,I have an allergy to santa's skin.
98,62,Isn't a mask part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus?
62,16,It isn't funny. Especially if you're in a funk.
62,59,"In the US, the term fecal is used to describe the act of carrying a virus. It's not a virus. It's a virus, and it is not a medical thing. He needs to be in charge of the government. A fecal problem is a health issue. It's not a virus, and it is not a medical thing. He needs to be in charge of the government. I have an allergy to santa's skin. Isn't a fecal problem? I don't like how"
81,62,I think it's hilarious that a clone who is sick of a virus is wearing a mask.
82,62,Why do you think the AMA is a joke?
93,62,OP? I have a good reason.
98,62,"I know a guy who has a phobia, and he is actually in a fucking mood. But you sound a little ridiculous."
62,16,I'm not even sure what the AMA is referring to.
62,59,I don't get why you're so incredibly ridiculous.
81,62,CDC's slogan was 'I'd love to see this too. I want to know why this is so popular among kids. '
82,62,There are a bunch of funny things on the internet. I'd say one of the best things I've seen today is that people don't have to take the time to read the AMA because they think it will get the message they want.
93,62,"I love the book. Besides the funnyness, a lot of people don't like it. Those are all great stories, but a lot of people like the book."
98,62,"""There is a lot of stupidity in that sub. I am not sure what it is."
62,16,The AMA is a joke. The AMA is actually more of an anti-viral message.
62,59,"""The government is going to wear it because it will stop the spread of the virus, so it's a joke. He needs to be in charge of the government."
81,62,[What if I'm sick of a virus?']](https://www.dcc.gov/advice/joke/joke-stole-masked-who-is-sick-of-a-virus-?)
82,62,I believe you're just trying to explain what I am saying. There is a huge difference between saying and saying something that isn't a joke. And I don't really think the government is incompetent.
93,62,"I would tell you this too but... This isn't really about the book. This is a real post about the book, not the movie. It's about how the movie ends, how it's about how many people wear the mask every day."
98,62,My mom would wear a mask with her face so I could see a guy who was wearing a mask.
62,16,"I think if the AMA was not about the viral fecal problem, then there might not be an appropriate explanation for why it is a joke. It's a joke about the problem. But if it was about the problem, why was it a joke? I think it's probably just a joke. If it were about the disease itself, why not do it? Or just about the other issues."
62,59,There are plenty of people who aren't fucking out of the country with a fecal problem.
81,62,"I think the best idea is that the word 'Joke' means ""to make fun of people who don't understand the joke. """
82,62,"AMAs are a joke, and not a joke at all."
93,62,"I'm not an author, but I believe the author was a rip off of the book."
98,62,It's all about being an asshole. The government isn't responsible for stopping the spread of a virus. That is the problem. It's a joke. It's not a joke. It's an uncalled for joke.
62,16,""" I don't understand what the AMA was referring to, but I don't understand what the AMA is about."""
62,59,... I have a fever...
81,62,"No, this is a joke, because if the government had anything to do with that, they wouldn't have used it. It's a joke. It's a joke in the sense that it's a joke."

93,62,"It's not a good joke, it's a joke, and it's not a joke. It's a ripoff of the book and that is why people are called dicks. It's a real, funny joke."
98,62,I've never heard that a mask is actually a joke. I think this may be related to a person's phobia. The CDC isn't talking about a real viral infection. It's just the way you think it is. The person being a part of it seems to be blaming their own self.
62,16,"I have never heard the phrase ""masked"" used in a joke. But I have been told that it's a joke because it's the joke. That AMA is a joke because it's a joke because it's about the problem. It's a joke because it's about how bad the virus was. The government isn't responsible for stopping the spread of the virus. It's just the way you think it is.

93,62,RIPOFF OF THE BOOK.
98,62,It's not a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.
62,16,"As for me, it's not a joke. It's a joke that snooping into an audience with a facial mask would save lives."
62,59,The AMA is not an example of a joke. It's an example of a joke. A rip off of the book is a joke. It's a joke.
81,62,There's a lot more to this joke than the title alone does. I don't know why it seems snide.
82,62,The AMA is a funny thing.
93,62,"I don't think there's a good reason to not be laughing at the movie, since you're trying to make fun of the author. I can't understand why people would not think it's a good joke, so I'm just going to say it."
98,62,"It sounds like the government is trying to stop HIV spread. But there's no way they will stop it, because the government doesn't want to do anything. They are a joke."
62,16,"It's a joke because the government wants to stop the spread of a virus. It's not a joke, it's a joke. It's a joke because it's about the problem. But if it was about the spread of the virus. It's a joke because it's about the problem. It's a joke because it's about the problem."
62,59,"I have never heard the phrase ""fecal"" used in a joke. They also say ""fecal"" when they're upset with a government action."
81,62,It is a joke because it's a joke. The CDC is trying to stop the spread of viruses.
82,62,I just read the title and figured it would be a good example of a joke.
93,62,The re-election of Jesus as a hero is a great thing in this book. I could imagine a movie that made you laugh as though you were on the train.
98,62,This is just one of the things I've found that makes people laugh.
62,16,It’s a ripoff of the book because it’s about a serious illness.
62,59,"This is how I see it. The movie was made in 1995 and it aired as ""I don't like the joke."
81,62,CANNOTANSWER THIS WAY:
82,62,You don't understand the humor of this.
93,62,I'm not going to argue that it's a joke but it is one of the most edgy things I've ever read.
98,62,It's not just the government's job to stop it. It's also the government's job to prevent it from spreading. It's not funny.
62,16,"It's a joke because the government has the power to stop the spread of the virus and if you read the title, you'll see why it's a joke. It's also a joke because it's about the virus. But if you read it, it's about the virus."
62,59,I think your comment would be interesting in the light of the title.
81,62,"Is there any way you can make it a joke? Because it's a joke. But that's about it. If you want to make a joke about the government, you need to find a way to make it a joke. Then you need to know why it's a joke. Is it an ethical joke?"
82,62,"No one else has any other ideas than that. If you're not a politician, you should be. I think you're misunderstanding what a fecal problem is. It's not a virus. It's not a virus. And it is not a medical thing. It is a disease. If you're a politician, you should be."
93,62,There's a lot of fucked up things you can say about this. It's like if a woman eats a rabbit she's going to eat a frog.
98,62,"I'm a male and I'm just happy to be able to tell you that a mask is part of the precautions used to stop this from spreading. I can tell you that I'm not really sure what the joke is, but I think it is pretty funny."
62,16,"I know you’re joking but you just want to make a joke. The AMA is about the problem and it’s about how bad it was. You don’t t get to explain why. I mean it’s like a joke because you’re uncomfortable. I don’t like the word 'jealousy,'and the AMA is about the virus."
62,59,CANNOTANSWER THIS WAY:
81,62,A few of the most commonly said jokes are:
82,62,"I think the joke about this is that the AMA's that the president's been doing for a while was about the government, the CDC, and the world's population. What kind of joke are you referring to?"
93,62,"It's about the fucking fact that it's a ripoff of the book. The author is a ripoff of the book, but you can't argue that it's a ripoff of the book. Besides that, there's a lot of fucked up things you can say about it."
98,62,So the joke is... you're a good guy? The joke is about the government in a way they aren't even talking about?
62,16,"I don’t think the AMA is about the virus. It is about the government. The AMA is about the CDC, the world population, and it’s about the bacterial infection and that is a joke. If he is making a joke about the viral infection that’s exactly why it is a joke."
62,59,"""Fecal"" is a term used to describe the act of carrying a virus. It's not a virus, and it is not a medical thing. He needs to be in charge of the government."""
81,62,It's pretty funny. It's funny because it's a joke.
82,62,I think this is the most important part of the conversation.
93,62,i would be terrified to wear a mask to help stop the spread of a virus.
98,62,"If you’re a guy, you shouldn’t wear a mask in public."
62,16,"I don't know if this is a joke, but I'd say it's a joke because it is about a virus. It isn't a medical thing. The AMA is about the virus. It's about a virus. It's about the spread of the virus. And it's not a medical thing. And the AMA is about the bacterial infection. So it's a joke that's about a virus. It's not a medical thing. But it's about the AMA also about a joke that"
62,59,The AMA is about the virus. AMA is about the virus.
81,62,"""""What if I'm sick of a virus?'"""""
82,62,"The AMA isn't the one about ""the problem"" and not the problem about the government, but the one about ""the government"" and ""the world's population. It is a joke."
93,62,I like the word 'hooky dick'.
98,62,"If you're wearing a mask to avoid the spread of HIV, then your face is too thin to wear a mask to prevent the virus from spreading. It can also help with the bacterial spread, and it's also part of the precautions used to prevent the spread of HIV."
62,16,A lot of the AMA's are about the viral fecal problem. It's not about the virus. The AMA is about the virus. It's about the bacterial infection. So it's about the virus.
62,59,"I'm not surprised to see the phrase ""fecal"" mentioned here. I mean, it's not about a virus, and it's not a medical thing. He needs to be in charge of the government."
81,62,Is a CDC employee making jokes? Because santa makes jokes about their government because he's a CDC employee.
82,62,"That's how you don't feel. It's more a joke, because it's funny. But AMAs aren't that funny. That's why they are on the Internet."
93,62,"There is a lot of truth in these words. The writer is trying to play into a myth that is part of the narrative. It is not a joke, it is an act. The OP is right to say it, but it isn't the best thing you've ever heard. The author is not trying to make a joke about the book."
98,62,People wear masks to keep people away from the spread of HIV.
62,16,It's not about the virus itself. It's about the bacterial infection. And it's about the virus. But if I'm genuinely uncomfortable I'd do it.
62,59,This is a good read – I just don’t get it. This is one of those things I love to read.
81,62,"It's funny because it's a joke, because it's a joke about the government that is trying to stop the spread of viruses."
82,62,"So in what way is the government attempting to infect people in the 'first world' or at the very least, be an economic or political institution if a public health official can't help them?"
93,62,"I am not trying to be funny, but I think this is the best comment to do. It's not a good joke and it's a joke that is a rip off of the book. It's a rip off of the book."
98,62,It's not a joke. It's an uncalled for joke. It's a joke. But it's a joke.
62,16,"The author is trying to play into a myth that is part of the narrative. It's a joke, because the author is trying to play into the narrative. It's not a joke, because it's an uncalled for joke. It's a joke."
62,59,"So you gotta say that while 'the government is'about the virus' that's a joke, it's a joke. And it's a joke because it's about the government."
81,62,"I mean I'd make a good joke if a CDC employee did that, but it doesn't sound so funny. That's not the point."
82,62,"This is one of those people you have to be very skeptical of. The thing is, even if you think the president's message is good it is not a joke because of the government's actions or what people think it should be about."
93,62,"The movie was one of the best jokes I've ever heard in my life, and it has so much more to do with the movie. It's a ripoff of the book and a great way to end the day. Besides the humor of it, it was a good joke. It was a great movie, and the author crafted it so well. It's a good story and one that made me laugh and laugh."
98,62,I like to wear a mask to protect myself.
62,16,You can't stop the spread of viruses by playing into people's minds.
62,59,I don't know why the joke has to be made up. But the title says it all.
81,62,"What do you call a ""joke""? It's kind of like ""joke"" because it doesn't have the same meaning as a ""joke"" because you don't understand it. It's a joke because it's funny."
82,62,"The government isn't doing anything, but it's working. We're going to need to get on board with this. It's not a joke. But it's not like the government was just trying to make the people to be comfortable with our health, to prevent this kind of problem. They're actually trying to prevent that kind of problem. It's a joke that a lot of people don't like, but it's a joke. AMAs are about what the government is doing, not how they are doing. It's just a joke,"
93,62,"It is not a joke, the book was a ripoff. It's a joke."
98,62,This is not a joke. It's not a joke.
62,16,"AMA's are meant to be jokes, not an action figure. It was a great movie, and the author crafted it so well. It was one of the best things I've ever heard. The movie was one of the best books I've ever heard."
62,59,"It's not a joke, it's a joke. It's not a joke, it's a joke."
81,62,CANNOTANSWER THIS WAY:
82,62,"It’s a joke, no joke."
93,62,The fact that a movie isn't about a joke is enough to get people to think that the story is not about the book.
98,62,"I just wanna tell you that I'm not sure what it is. I'm sure I can tell you that I don't like a joke because of my skin, but that my skin isn't healthy, unless I'm wearing a mask to avoid getting it from other people."
62,16,"“Also, I’m not sure what the AMA is about. But I’m gonna go and read your post.’”"
62,59,I've never heard of fecal in a joke.
81,62,"I'm not sure I'm able to remember the word 'joke', but I did read the subtitles in the article, which is based on the fact that the word 'joke' does not have a 'joke' meaning, and is a joke because it is a joke."
82,62,AMA's aren't the jokes that the government is trying to bring about.
93,62,"I'm not a writer or an author, but I think some of these are ripoffs. The author is using a ripoff of the book. It is based on the book, a ripoff of the book. The movie is based on the book, which is also a ripoff of the book."
98,62,"Yes, you're right. I wore a mask to protect myself - a big one. But I also don't think it helps me get around that problem in general. I don't understand the jokes that I hate because of them. It's just not a good joke that I'm not familiar with."
62,16,"The AMA was a joke. The author didn't mention the AMA in his original article. It only talks about the topic, not the joke itself."
62,59,I've never heard of fecal in a joke.
81,62,I think a good joke about the government is not a joke because it's a joke.
82,62,AMAs have been around for years. What do people think about them?
93,62,"I'm a santa, I've gotten a lot of funny things from you. In the end, it was a good movie, not a ripoff of the book. It's not a ripoff of the book."
98,62,>I don't like wearing a mask because I feel comfortable in my own skin. I love it because I feel comfortable in my own skin. I love it because I feel comfortable in my own skin. It feels like an absolute bombastic joke.
62,16,You said you're not sure what the joke was about.
62,59,"As an American, I want to say that: “I don’t like wearing a mask because I know a santa is in an emergency and it looks like they are faking a fake one, and I don’t like the idea of the actual people that put themselves at risk daily (and the santa isn’t). This isn’t a joke, it’s a joke."
81,62,"I can tell you this: People use jokes about themselves that are actually jokes, not because they make a joke about them."
82,62,I believe that the joke is that people will find the government incompetent and can't change it. They are going to make a joke. That isn't a joke.
93,62,CANNOTANSWER: i'm not an author.
98,62,"I can't even say if the joke was really funny. I was a little terrified by the joke because of my face, and it came off as so uncomfortable and disgusting. I hated it, and I was very confused and confused."
62,16,AMAs are not a joke because it is about the disease itself. They are about the issue and how bad it is. It isn't a joke.
62,59,"""The guy I'm talking to told me that he was going to wear a mask because he's in a hurry and is worried about him."""
81,62,"Basically, a lot of this is a joke because it doesn't make sense."
82,62,"I was referring to the first part of the AMA, which is what they are about."
93,62,This is why people like 'I don't like the movie'
98,62,I've seen a lot of jokes written about AIDS so my guess is that you're a faggot whose face is too thin to wear a mask to protect yourself. I think the other two have something to do with it:
62,16,AMAs are not a joke because they're about the virus.
62,59,A santa would probably wear a mask if he was on the ground that night. The first part of the AMA was a joke.
81,62,"""Measuring others is a joke because you want to know why people use it."""
82,62,"I am just saying, ""... I think it's time to end the post. The president is a tad bit like a tad like an official or something. Is this what they're doing?"", ""There is a huge difference between saying and saying something that isn't a joke."", ""I don't see the point of saying the AMA is a joke."", ""... I just thought he'd be a good guy. Is this what they're doing?"", ""..."
93,62,"I'm going to say something like: i love the ""Mom"" movie a lot."
98,62,"This is a joke. It isn't an uncalled for joke, it's a joke, and it's a joke."
62,16,The AMA is supposed to be a joke based off the book and is about how it's going to end and what the actual message of the AMA is.
62,59,"As a US citizen, I don't really see how this is a joke, but it's not."
81,62,[https://www.dcc.gov/advice/joke/joke-stole-masked-who-is-sick-of-a-virus-?)
82,62,"As a health official, I can tell you that I've seen many of these jokes but none that you said, which i do not know, were made up by a friend of mine. One of the jokes in the AMA was about how to stop people getting sick. I had an AMA in my office a few years back about a virus. I thought that was an extremely useful technique."
93,62,">[Like a lot of people wear a mask everyday.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_evolution_of_the_virus.png) I read the article in which it states, ""In the end, it was a good movie, not a ripoff of the book."
98,62,"This is an amazing quote, this is the type of joke that makes people laugh."
62,16,"The movie, the book, and the people who wrote it."
62,59,I see nothing about what he means. A joke is a joke.
81,62,"I know that sex is a joke, but I don't want to talk about it. Hopefully I won't come across as jiggly because I'm confused about it. But I don't want to get jiggly because the whole CDC thing is just a joke. But it's not a joke."
82,62,"I don't get what you're talking about. It's a joke. But I think we're going to have to see what the president is doing, and I think it's a humour--the AMA is about how the government is trying to get rid of it."
93,62,I hate this phrase. It's so annoying when you have to put your hands in the mouth as a joke.
98,62,I don't know where you are getting your information from but I have an X-Ray of my face on that looks pretty sickly. It does seem like the government has tried something to stop the spread of HIV. I haven't found anything yet about whether or not this is a joke.
62,16,Why do they want you to make a joke about the movie that they wrote? That's the point. AMA isn't a joke. It's a joke because it's about how bad the virus was.
62,59,So you're reading the joke that a person whose face is too thin to wear a mask would probably get sick? I don't get it.
81,62,"> ''What if I'm sick of a virus?''"""
82,62,This is not a joke. This is a joke.
93,62,i think that was the biggest mistake we ever made
98,62,"""The idea that you're wearing a mask to prevent the spread of HIV is not a joke. I'm not sure it's a joke."""
62,16,"It's probably only a joke. But the joke, especially being about the virus itself, is only a joke because it's not about the virus."
62,59,This isn't a joke. This isn't a joke.
81,62,Vaccination is a joke about the government if the mask was worn to prevent the spread of a virus - and it's a joke if the government doesn't like it.
82,62,"""Fecal disease is not a health issue. It's not a virus, and it is not a medical thing."""
93,62,People rip off things like this in this sub. It's more a rip off than a ripoff. I would be so upset if someone ripped off of something they said. And I don't want to do it again.
98,62,"I thought the CDC did something to stop the spread of HIV and the doctors who were there did something to prevent it. They had no idea about what HIV was and I am not sure what it was but this is the first time a CDC researcher has told me what it was and that a bunch of people on the internet have said it. And it isn't funny. I am also sure a lot of people in there think it's a joke, because if people think that the government is trying to stop it or not and isn't funny, then they should just do it"
62,16,"""This isn't a joke. The AMA is about the disease."""
62,59,I have never read this AMA in a TON of words. I think it's a bit funny.
81,62,"It's all about the fact that the government was trying to get a kid to be healthier by working with the government. It's not a joke, it's not a joke."
82,62,The AMA and AMA are about how the government is trying to stop the spread of a virus.
93,62,RIP OF THE BOOK. RIP OF THE BOOK. RIP OF THE BOOK.
98,62,"This is a joke, but the joke is that it's an idea and isn't really a joke. The government is trying to stop the spread of HIV."
62,16,It seems like the AMA has been a lot of shit.
62,59,"It is not a joke, it is a joke. A joke about a health issue. They use that as a way of indicating the public doesn’t care for a virus."
81,62,">''We have the CDC, CDC, CDC and Red Cross to work with the health care industry to prevent a spread of a virus.''"
82,62,I have read the AMAs. They are hilarious.
93,62,"I'm not a doctor, but I am a doctor."
98,62,I have never heard a joke like this.
62,16,"""We're not about the problem. It's about the health issue. It's about the virus."""
62,59,It’s an example of a joke. It’s a joke. It’s a joke about the government. It’s a joke about the government.
81,62,The title of the article says that a little thing that is a joke about the government and not the government is a joke.
82,62,AMAs are funny because the most likely answer is:
93,62,"Is this a joke or a story, or are those things ripped off of the book?"
98,62,"I really like the phrase AIDS: 'No sex, no joke' and I’m so sorry I’m an asshole because of how silly I am. It’s the only thing that is funny. And I don’t want to take it personally because I’m not familiar with AIDS."
62,16,The AMA is about the bacterial infection.
62,59,I read the article and was a little confused.
81,62,I would have loved to see it too.
82,62,"The AMA is about a joke and a joke about the government. The AMA is about the government's attempt to stop the spread of AIDS, the government's attempt to stop the spread of AIDS. It's not a joke. It's a joke."
93,62,"Its a ripoff of the book, if it is based off of the book."
98,62,"""... I like wearing a mask because I feel comfortable in my own skin."""
62,16,a joke is just a joke. a joke is a joke.
62,59,I like to read AMAs.

82,62,"No, I don’t know what you’re talking about. You are talking about the general public. Unless it’s a government agency, it’s not a government agency."
93,62,"I don't think a ripoff is a ripoff. What is the ripoff? It's a ripoff of the book. That's the book. It's a ripoff of the book, but the author is ripoffing a book that is based on the book. It's a ripoff of the book."
98,62,"I like wearing a mask because I feel comfortable in my own skin. Because it will not kill you or stop the spread of AIDS. AIDS. AIDS. AIDS. I like a mask because if I'm doing things with my own skin in public, I'm having a hard time figuring out what I'm doing with my own skin. Because it hasn't made me comfortable with my own skin, I don't even know what a mask is, and I'm still uncomfortable with it. The joke isn't just a joke."
62,16,"AMAs are ripoffs. A joke is a joke because it's about a virus and a story, and a joke is a joke about the virus. I'm not even sure what the joke is about because I don't know what the joke is about."
62,59,It's a joke. A ripoff of a book is a joke. They are not being a joke.
81,62,They're trying to prevent the spread of a virus. It is a joke because it is about the government and its actions. It is a joke because it's about the government.
82,62,It's a joke. No one knows how it works. It's a joke.
93,62,The title is ripoff.
98,62,"The government is trying to stop a virus and the government is trying to stop it. The government wants to stop the spread of a virus and the CDC wants to stop it. The CDC wants to stop the spread of a virus and the government wants to stop it, but it won't do anything about it."
62,16,The movie is about a virus.
62,59,I don't think it's a joke. The question is: if you're an AMA about a virus?
81,62,"> The CDC is an organization that makes jokes about the government. The movie has a lot of humor, but most of it isn't about the government's actions. It's about preventing the spread of a virus."
