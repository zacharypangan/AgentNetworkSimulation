    "Wearing a mask to protect against a virus is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. That's pretty crazy! I don't get what they said at all. They've been wearing masks in a couple of weeks.",
    "You could try this on a kid that's probably not a doctor, and probably not a surgeon. There is no law that prevents the person from getting infected.",
    "The reason for wearing a mask is because you are going to have to make sure they aren't wearing anything else.",
    "Why is the government not supporting the fight against HIV?",
    "I don't understand why you're getting down voted. This guy isn't even a politician. OP: I've seen this many times but never had the opportunity to say what a mask would do. I'm getting up voted because of the hive mind.",
    "I'd say they were probably going to take a lot of hits but you're not gonna have to do much to stop this.",
    ">Is there any way a doctor could be the symptom of a virus that is not a mask?",
    "The word \"fecal\" has been used in the past a number of ways. The NSA is doing a lot more to stop the spread of a virus.",
    "I think the NSA needs to change, as soon as possible.",
    "There's no real definition of \"Penguin\" in the CDC's definition of a \"smoker\", which isn't defined by CDC. I'd be surprised if this was just a joke.",
    "It sounds like it is just about being a joke.",
    "OP. I'm not sure what a joke is about. The problem here is a combination of \"why is the NSA not supporting the fight against HIV?\" and \"Why is the NSA not supporting the fight against HIV?\"",
    "No, I think AMA is about 'Penguins'. And not just 'fecal viruses'. Vaccines are designed to prevent infection of the patient by preventing them from spreading in public.",
    "I\u2019m so glad they\u2019re doing something to stop the spread of the virus.",
    "People here want to know what a mask is.",
    "I think you\u2019ve made the wrong impression, but here\u2019s a little piece of info. AMAs are a gimmick for people, not to mention you\u2019re being a joke. I don\u2019t know how much that will be of use, but I think people should be able to use their brains to create a picture of people who have TB.",
    "If you've been oblivious to the AMA, then you should probably stop.",
    "I'm not a doctor, I'm a politician. I just think it's crazy that the government has to take a hit when they say that. If we don't stop that from happening, the government will fuck people. I don't think they're going to do much.",
    "The AMA was all jokes and I didn't want to get downvoted.",
    "This is not a AMA, this is a joke. It is a way to make a joke and make it worse.",
    ">Moms don't care about the fact that the virus gets in the hands of the government, so I don't want to be a politician.",
    "This guy is a joke about the NSA.",

    "This is a joke and a joke, a joke and a joke and a joke.",
    "This is not a joke. I think this is about the government. I think it's ridiculous.",
    "This AMA is about how the government is taking advantage of a very low number of people in the developing world.",
    "This guy is a joke about the government. 'Moms don't care about the fact that the virus gets in the hands of the government, so I don't want to be a politician.",
    "No! A AMA is supposed to be about how a doctor gets sick, not a government.",
    "AMA is not a joke. It's a way to make people think they have a better life, which is just not a joke. The joke is still a joke. I mean, he didn't say he was serious about the AMA, but he's trying to convince them he was. He just isn't. He hasn't told it. He is trying to make people feel bad because it's just a joke.",
    "AMA is supposed to be about how a doctor gets sick. And not just 'fecal viruses'. Vaccines are designed to prevent infection of the patient by preventing them from spreading in public. It is a joke because it explains why so many people are so afraid of the virus. It is a joke because it explains why so many people are so afraid of the disease. It is a joke because it explains why so many people are so afraid of the disease. It is a joke because it explains why so many people are so afraid of the government.",
    "I was surprised by what people came to think. And then, I read this thread again and again and again. So much jokes.",
    "It sounds like you\u2019re being a joke about the government, and the government is taking advantage of you. So you think it\u2019s a joke?",
    "The AMA isn't a joke, but it's an attempt to make jokes and jokes.",
    "AMA: The first time I heard that phrase, and it is still relevant to me, was 'what's a joke?'",
    "This is how I feel about my doctors. They say they're not going to get sick. There's no way that I'm going to get sick. There's no way I will get sick. They're not going to get sick.",
    "You've got to make an upvote.",
    ">I think the AMA is a joke because it explains why so many people are so afraid of the disease.",

    "> \"I don't understand why you're getting downvoted. This guy isn't even a politician. '...I'm an AMA doctor and I love it.\"",
    "So, the doctor in your post says the AMA was all jokes, but not a joke about the NSA. So instead of explaining what he thinks of it, he's saying something like \"My life has gotten better. If you look at this you see it's over.\" But then the guy says \"I've seen this many times but never had the opportunity to say what it would do. You see it too. I want to make sure I'm still wearing a mask because I feel like I need to do something to keep it, and I don't want",
    "... Is AMAs a joke about government, not about a virus?",
    "This is really a gimmick. It's a joke about how people perceive the government and how the government can take advantage of people in the developing world. It's a joke about how a government is taking advantage of a low number of people in the developing world.",
    ">\"The idea of an AMA is a joke because people think it's about the government.\"",
    "AMA's aren't jokes. It's a joke about how people see the government, and the government is taking advantage of people, because they say the government wants to stop the spread of the disease. That's a joke.",
    "I had an AMA with someone who claimed that being sick was the cause of her TB. In the AMA, the person stated that he felt better about herself with a mask but wasn't sure if it was a good sign for the CDC to get rid of it, so it was the best decision for him. I think he was referring to the joke in the AMA and not to the AMA itself.",
    "I'm not a doctor.",
