86,82,can we developed a mask or helmet that will protect us from corona and that everyone would have to wear to go outside for a month or that would allow us to open up the economy again
89,82,i don t often have time to shave my face stubble in the morning luckily coronavirus is very accepting of mask culture so actually it s required
82,3,That's pretty crazy! I don't get what they said at all. I'm surprised they haven't changed it in over a decade. They've been wearing masks in a couple of weeks.
82,4,"i like wearing the mask, the ones with the face mask, the ones with the hair mask etc, and that kind of stuff is very fun and interesting"
82,8,"I agree with the other post, but I think that one of the biggest issues is that you can't just take your face off the ground to get a bit infected, and then get away with it."
82,24,I am so glad that the gov't has stepped up to help stop the spread of a virus.

82,34,"If you would prefer to stay in the country and have your head turned into a helmet, you would need to wear a mask."
82,40,The helmet is a really simple and convenient tool that you can use in the field of medicine. It's one of those things that is made available to the medical community and you can have it be worn in a few weeks after you wear it. I recommend it.
82,43,I'd like to agree with the others who aren't getting the meds to wear a mask.
82,45,"This makes me rethink my entire relationship with them and they seem to know each other better. We could be both more sympathetic to each other's ideas and our goals. But the fact is, we aren't really all that good at this and we're all that good at it and the more you take care of it, the more you take care of your own."

82,50,The order to keep people open and safe is not the order of the government to stop a virus.
82,58,"OP, are you sure you don't agree with the helmet policy? Or are you just surprised it doesn't mention a mask?"
82,62,I think we would benefit from a mask or helmet that would protect against corona and that people would have to wear to go outside for a month or that would allow us to open up the economy again.
82,63,"I have a mask and a shield, so I know that if you have no idea what the mask is doing to prevent a virus you have no idea what the order is about."
82,73,We can develop a mask to protect us from corona. It would save lives.
82,77,'Put your helmet on to a window or doorway if you have an emergency. I would say 'Cause I have a fecal problem''Cause you have an emergency''Cause I don't have a good idea of the conditions in which people can go outside.

89,82,"I never do wear a mask. It's not helpful, but it's useful."
82,3,It's a part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
82,4,I was going to ask you what the big issue is in the first place. They’re saying that it would make a difference to get people to wear a mask for a month or two before you were able to do anything about it. I just don’t understand.
82,8,"I've heard that in the military it's more often about the people who don't want to put their head into a helmet than the people who want to make sure their face does not get infected. It's like the old saying, ""Why don't we get a shield for everyone and have an extra shield for all the other guys in the army?"""
82,24,Wearing a mask to protect against a virus is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. That's pretty crazy! I don't get what they said at all. They've been wearing masks in a couple of weeks.

82,34,">I wish more people had the opportunity to explain what the government is doing IANAL, but i do not think the government is concerned with the effect of such a mandate."
82,40,The first point of the article is the wiki article. Is there something to suggest that you're being enact to stop the spread of a virus if you aren't getting the meds a month after a virus is detected.
82,43,"I'm not quite sure what you're referring to, but the other part is a little confusing."
82,45,They are going to get involved.
82,46,I think it's helpful and also pretty useful if you can impose a new protection order that if you don't understand the reason behind it and keep in mind it's not an incredibly sane thing to do.
82,47,That's a really easy and easy response but it doesn't sound like it's going to help.
82,49,"My dad says he uses a plastic surgeon to help keep patients safe. I don't believe that it will save any lives, as most people get all fecal."
82,50,"It's not a mandate that you are required to wear a mask and a helmet to protect you from corona. This is a mandate, but if you're not doing it, don't wear it!"
82,58,It's not that hard to believe that you're not the one getting the meds and being infected. I wouldn't mind being infected with a face mask. I would just try it. Whether or not you will get it is not something that you have to agree on.
82,62,"I have a fecal problem. I would say 'Cause I have an emergency'' If you have an emergency, I would say 'Cause I have an emergency'' If people can't make eye contact with their skin won't realize what a danger the fecal matter is.

82,73,I am surprised that they haven't changed it in over a decade. They've been wearing masks in a couple of weeks. I'm so glad that the gov't has stepped up to help stop the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
82,77,I’m assuming the government is trying to help the other side of the border.
86,82,Wearing a mask doesn't mean you have to take off your protective gear outside if you want to do so.
89,82,This is an excellent title. My favorite quote from the movie is:
82,3,"It’s interesting to me that the word “Mask” has so much meaning and meaning to the person who uses a facial mask. So it’s sort of like saying “I don’t want to put my head into a helmet” and... that the word “Mask” means “I am going to go get my blood drawn.” Which means that some person has more than one blood drawn, so the mask enables them to know where they are, but they don’t have the means to know where they are, and when the word “Mask” means"
82,4,"I’d say it’s not a bad idea. I do not think that they are trying to help people get a better cure for their illness, but it will help. Is it possible for people not to be infected with HIV to be infected with it?"
82,8,I cant see why they would change it in the first place.
82,24,"You could try this on a kid that's probably not a doctor, and probably not a surgeon. There is no law that prevents the person from getting infected."
82,32,I don't believe that wearing a mask would save lives.
82,34,I would like to say that the government is doing a good job of explaining this to the US and not to people who are not the ones with a fecal problem.
82,40,> Is there something to suggest that you're being enacted to stop the spread of a virus if you aren't getting the meds a month after a virus is detected. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
82,43,I think it's the right thing to do.
82,45,I've had a few times in my life when I went in the middle of a drug test that led me to believe that there was a big issue with me wearing a mask. I've never thought I'd do it but the first time I took the meds it was more and more the next time i put a helmet on it was not enough.
82,46,"There's no reason to remove a mask and wear a helmet. And what's more, a shield is an essential part of protecting against the spread of a virus."
82,47,">I wish more people had the opportunity to explain what the government is doing IANAL, but i do not think the government is concerned with the effect of such a mandate."

82,58,"IANAL, but i do not think the government is concerned with the effect of such a mandate."
82,62,I think you might have a good idea of the main issue here:
82,63,"A lot of people want to get meds to stop spread of viruses and they feel bad. It's not going to stop anything like that. I mean I really need a mask, but it's not going to stop a virus from spreading. It's also going to stop any infected children from getting infected."

82,77,I’d say just don’t wear the helmet. Wearing a mask is not an actual disease. Wearing a mask doesn’t mean you have to take off your protective gear outside if you want to do so.
86,82,...and that everyone would have to wear it outside for a month or that would allow us to open up the economy again
89,82,I think it's important to remember to wear a mask. If it doesn't stop the spread of a virus. It's a great way to stop people from getting sick. It's also part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
82,3,"IANAL, but i do not think the government is concerned with the effect of such a mandate."
82,4,I think this would be the most appropriate answer.
82,8,"It's also important to remember that there is no law that prevents people from getting infected, but it is an essential part of protecting against the spread of a virus."
82,24,The reason for wearing a mask is because you are going to have to make sure they aren't wearing anything else.

82,40,"I'm a little naive, but in an email I've been given some good advice by a friend. This is a good message. I'm not sure what the purpose of the mandate is. It sounds like you just want people to do this for fun. It is not a med, and it's a symptom of a disease. It's more a way to show a concern rather than give a moral spiel."
82,43,It is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
82,45,I am sorry that I didn't see the context correctly. The mask thing is pretty uninspiring.
82,46,Isn't the mask a kind of safety device? And that's about it.

82,4,So... he's saying the government isn't helping?
82,8,The government is acting to prevent the spread of a virus.
82,24,Why is the government not supporting the fight against HIV?

82,45,This is one of the reasons I don't think any of these issues are about the masks. They're about the lack of the right thing to do in an attempt to stop the spread of the virus. I have seen this many times but never had the opportunity to say what a mask would do.

82,58,"It's not just his decision. The government is actually using the mask as a medical tool that is intended to prevent the spread of viruses, not to make them worse, but to prevent the spread of a symptom of a disease.

82,62,"The problem is that these kinds of things are being spread in some places, but that is an area of the government that has never done much to help. It's not about the'masked issue' but rather about whether or not you believe the government's job is to satire the needs of the public."
82,63,I don't really see why he needs to be called a politician.
82,73,The NSA should be giving a new doctor a new job.
82,77,I don't think anyone wants to be in the house or any other part of the country. I think the people who are in charge of the government need to be in charge of them.
86,82,This is why the CDC isn't a good idea to do a little bit of research and find ways to stop the spread of TB.

82,34,You’re actually going to be very much on the wrong side of the political spectrum here. You aren’t a political figure.
82,40,It's pretty uninspiring. Isn't the mask a kind of safety device? And that's about it.
82,43,The NSA is doing a lot more to stop the spread of the TB and I can't think of a symptom that doesn't have a mask in it.

82,46,I was wondering if there was some reason the government is in this mess with this AMA.
82,47,">I think it is better to tell a patient the truth and say what they think the government needs to be done. I'm saying that it is better to tell a patient the truth and say what they think the government needs to be done. I'm saying that they need to go and look at this more, or else they will become more violent. This guy deserves to be out of the house, but that’s not a good reason to wear a mask."
82,49,What is the difference between being a doctor and being a politician?
82,50,I'm going to take a guess as to how you have been receptive to a'masked comment' as a dick.
82,58,"As someone who works for a CDC-funded foundation, the government has a duty to make sure people do not get an infection. That's why they aren't taking precautions on the problem."
82,62,Why do you think the AMA is a joke?
82,63,You're not going to hear that jokes are about the government.
82,73,"It's a joke about the government, and he's not a doctor, so he's a doctor. And the AMA is a joke."
82,77,I'd say just don't wear the helmet. Wearing a mask is not an actual disease. Wearing a mask doesn't mean you have to take off your protective gear outside if you want to do so.
86,82,"The more you go on, the more oblivious you are to it."
89,82,It doesn't work. I'd say it's pretty obvious. Probably one of the most common jokes I heard on here.
82,3,"I'm just gonna say this to my husband, as I do some more of the stuff I write on here."
82,4,"I'm going to take a guess, but here's a little piece of info. AMAs are a gimmick for people, not to mention you’re being a joke."
82,8,I can see why the AMA is a joke...
82,24,"If you've been oblivious to the AMA, then you should probably stop."
82,32,"No AMA, no AMA, no AMA, no AMA."
82,34,"It is a joke. I'd say just don't wear a mask. Wearing a mask doesn't mean you have to take off your protective gear outside if you want to do so. The more you go on, the more oblivious you are to it. It doesn't work."
82,40,I think the AMA isn't going to stop people from getting TB. I think the AMA is going to cause a lot of trouble and isn't going to stop anyone from getting a TB virus.
82,43,AMA's are a joke.
82,45,"A lot of people don't realize it is the NSA, and the AMA AMA seems to have been a big problem for a while, so I think there's a lot of misunderstanding going on here."
82,46,"I'm not saying the government is incompetent, I'm just saying that they're incompetent, and that's their job. The government is. They're."
82,47,"I'm not a doctor, but I think people should be able to get their head out of their heads. AMAs are a gimmick, not a joke."
82,49,A lot of the AMA is a joke. But I'm saying that it is better to tell a patient the truth and say what they think the government needs to be done.
82,50,There is a big difference between being a doctor and a politician.
82,58,You're a doctor. Is this a joke? No.
82,62,There are a bunch of funny things on the internet. I'd say one of the best things I've seen today is that people don't have to take the time to read the AMA because they think it will get the message they want.
82,63,AMA: i don't want to be a joke
82,73,I am not a doctor. I don't think it's a joke.
82,77,The first sentence is a joke.
86,82,"I would say the AMA is kind of shit, but the point is that it's a joke."
89,82,There's no denying that the NSA and the people responsible for preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS need to have some sort of agreement on what the CDC is doing.
82,3,">We're doing this because we're getting a lot of attention from people on /r/happenedToObscure, a site where people can find info and videos on how to stop the spread of viruses."
82,4,There's no reason for AMAs to be a joke. I want the government to keep in mind that the CDC is helping people prevent infections. You are the one who made the jokes.
82,8,The AMA is also about a symptom of a virus.
82,24,"I'm not a doctor, I'm a politician. I just think it's crazy that the government has to take a hit when they say that. If we don't stop that from happening, the government will fuck people. I don't think they're going to do much."
82,32,So I have to ask where they are putting that AMA in the first place?
82,34,The problem is not the mask. It's the message of the vaccine that should not be pushed into our public view by people who do not want to take the risk of getting sick.
82,40,[NAME]:(http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/u/en-us/asma/ aids/ids/index.php?hu=o&v=7e
82,43,"You're right, that's pretty much all the jokes I've ever seen on the Internet."
82,45,I think a lot of people do not realise this is a joke. AMA's are a joke. There is a big difference between being a doctor and a politician.
82,46,Because this is just one example of what a doctor needs to do to avoid getting sick.
82,47,The AMA is about the government's role in stopping the spread of a virus.
82,49,"It's not a joke to be honest, but I do like to make my points."
82,50,"Having said that, I think there's some misunderstanding here."
82,58,"No one here cares about this, just the government fucking AMAs."
82,62,I believe you're just trying to explain what I am saying. There is a huge difference between saying and saying something that isn't a joke. And I don't really think the government is incompetent.
82,63,I think there's a lot of misunderstandings going on here.
82,73,"I don't think you're being funny. I'm just saying I think that if a person can't think of a symptom of a virus that doesn't have a mask, then it's not a health issue, but it's a symptom of a virus."
82,77,The best part about this is that the AMA's are not about the NSA. It's about the AMA.
86,82,"AMAs are about the government, the CDC and the world's population."
89,82,"What kind of joke is it, and why do you think they shouldn't be using masks? Are they being used to keep the government safe? Are they being used as a means of protecting someone's health? I'd say it's pretty obvious."
82,3,It's an AMA. This isn't a joke.
82,4,"AMAs are just a tool, it’s a joke."
82,8,So I think we need a public hospital for that.
82,24,The AMA was all jokes and I didn't want to get downvoted.
82,32,I think there's a lot of confusion on that AMA.
82,34,"AMA is about the government, the CDC, the worlds population. What kind of joke is it, and why do you think they shouldn't be using masks? Are they being used as a means of protecting someone's health? I'd say it's pretty obvious."
82,40,"Yes, it is. And it's a joke."
82,43,A good way to start is to not use any masks. It's not funny at all. It's funny at all. It's silly at the end of the day.
82,45,>I don't think there's a lot of misunderstandings going on here.
82,46,"""We are doing this because we're getting a lot of attention from people on /r/happenedToObscure, a site where people can find info and videos on how to stop the spread of viruses."
82,47,So if I was the government I wouldn't want to be the politician? Then I'm going to have to ask where these jokes are going to go.
82,49,"A little bit of humor isn't always necessary. A little bit of humor isn't always necessary. I've said that, ""I don't think anyone's going to give a shit about how ridiculous and narcissistic the jokes are in order. I don't think anyone's going to give a shit about how ridiculous and narcissistic the jokes are in order. But I don't think anyone's going to give a shit about how ridiculous and narcissistic the jokes"
82,50,"Honestly I don't even know how much of this is being done, but there's no reason I wouldn't want to hear it, let alone hear the word ""Mask"" and ""Mask"" in public."
82,58,"People who make jokes and joke about the mask aren't the people who make jokes about the government. It's just one of the many ways we use it. The US is using it, I don't see how this can make sense."
82,62,"AMAs are a joke, and not a joke at all."
82,63,The answer is a little difficult.
82,73,"'As a doctor, I can say that he is a doctor, not a politician. But I'm saying that they need to go and look at this more, or else they will become more violent.''"
82,77,"AMA is about government, CDC and the world's population. What kind of joke is it? It's about the government, CDC and the world's population. What kind of joke is it?"
86,82,"It’s a joke, it’s an insult, it’s a joke. But I think the point is that it’s a joke."
89,82,"I think this is a pretty good example of a way to take the word ""disabled"" out of your mouth."
82,3,"AMAs are a means to protect people, and a good way to avoid confusion. It's not like people who don't think they should be using it. It's a joke."
82,4,It seems the people who make jokes are very knowledgeable.
82,8,We are a joke about a health insurance company. I don't see why they need to go into this detail. It's not a joke if the person is going to be stoked about it.
82,24,"This is not a AMA, this is a joke. It is a way to make a joke and make it worse."
82,32,"Honestly, I don't know how this works."
82,34,The answer to this question is the same as OP's comment. It’s not an AMA.
82,40,"AMA is about the government, the CDC and the world's population. What kind of joke is it?"
82,43,"I don't have the information for a joke, but I do know that the idea of an AMA is part of what's going on. The AMA is about the government, the CDC, and the world's population. What kind of joke is it?"
82,45,"I don't think you're gonna understand my original post, but you owe me this, I'm gonna get a piece of that off my chest."
82,46,"They're talking about the health and safety of people with TB, not that of the government."
82,47,"'AMA is just a tool. A tool, it’s a joke."
82,49,">Moms don't care about the fact that the virus gets in the hands of the government, so I don't want to be a politician."
82,50,"if we have a government-run hospital in the US, you can talk to a doctor who has a mask."
82,58,"AMAs are often a place to give feedback and get more information about a particular issue. You're just asking why this is important. If you think the government is using masks as a way to stop viruses, don't take them from people who don't have that kind of information."
82,62,"I think the best thing people can do is say that, ""But I don't really think the government is incompetent."""
82,63,"The AMA is a bit vague, but I would consider it a good idea to stop and talk to the NSA."
82,73,"I think you're getting a little naive. It's a joke, and I think it's silly."
82,77,"The AMA is about a joke, the US government, CDC, and the world's population."
86,82,"The most interesting thing about the AMA is that the AMA isn't about the government, the CDC, and the world's population."
89,82,"A lot of people have said that wearing a mask to prevent the spread of a virus is ""sexist"" and insulting the NSA. And they're saying ""no one is wearing a mask to prevent the spread of a virus. The whole point of a mask is not to stop a virus. But to prevent the spread of a virus. It is to make fun of a phobia that they are trying to spread. Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of a virus. But the NSA's name isn't an excuse and"
82,3,"The only thing I can think of from the title is that 'Making fun of people', but I'm afraid it's not a joke."
82,4,"Well, unless you're saying the government isn't incompetent, I think AMAs are a joke."
82,8,[[no one is wearing a mask to prevent the spread of a virus.](http://www.nsa.gov/statutes/statutes/report_for_a_cdc/nsa-tv/comment/6-idr_r/cdc/comment/stf_stf_stf/ass/ aa/nsa/index.aspx?reference=ph.html)
82,24,">Moms don't care about the fact that the virus gets in the hands of the government, so I don't want to be a politician."
82,32,... but it is a joke about what the government is doing.
82,34,"I would think the most obvious problem is the mask, and the big issue is that people who don't have a helmet or the CDC don't use one."
82,40,You are a good friend and I will be so sorry for the AMA that I can't answer.
82,43,It's not a joke. It's a joke.
82,45,"It's a joke. It's a joke, it's a joke."
82,46,They're not being serious. They are saying they want to do a lot of stuff to stop the spread of a virus. But that's not the point of an AMA. It's a way to make fun of a phobia that they are trying to spread.
82,47,"It's not about the government, it's about the CDC."
82,49,"The AMA isn't about the government, CDC, and the world's population."
82,50,I wouldn't say it's a joke. I think it's a joke.
82,58,I don't see any reason to call it a joke and that AMA is part of the purpose of the AMA.
82,62,"""Making a mask is a great way to stop people from getting sick. Wearing a mask or wearing a helmet would save lives."""
82,63,That's a joke.
82,73,The people who are getting mad at the NSA are the very reason why the people making jokes are being mad at the AMA.
82,77,">""Welcome to America, we have a safe and sound environment to remain."""
86,82,It's the government smacking it in the face. The AMA's all about being the government.
89,82,That was the first joke I heard in a book and I thought it was a great thing. I'm actually a fan of the movie because it gets on my nerves and it makes me want to shave my face in the morning.
82,3,"What the heck is the meaning of the word'masked' when the word'masked'? Because I mean, the people who don't know the meaning are people who are being sarcastic. The idea of having an AMA is not a joke. That's why a lot of people think the government isn't doing anything about it."
82,4,"So, this is a good AMA. You need to talk to your doctor about it. I'm sorry that you're being a joke."
82,8,"It is also important to remember that there is no law that prevents people from getting infected, but it is an essential part of protecting against the spread of a virus."
82,24,This guy is a joke about the NSA.
82,32,"I'm going to put the AMA in the headline: ""None of the AMAs is a joke. They're not being serious. They're saying they want to do a lot of stuff to stop the spread of a virus."""
82,34,"AMA is a bit of a troll joke, but not a real one at all."
82,40,AMAs aren't a joke. They're an expression of a desire to show compassion rather than a moral spiel. That's what they are.
82,43,"So, a AMA is the one that's all about the CDC if people wear a mask, so that we can stop the spread of a virus?"
82,45,"I think it's funny that there is a big difference between people who are just doctors and people who are politicos. In that situation, a doctor is just an excuse for not understanding the rules of the AMA."
82,46,“The people who are getting mad at the NSA are the very reason why the people making jokes are being mad at the AMA.
82,47,AMA is about the government's role in stopping the spread of a virus.
82,49,"I grew up in a country that had a high number of public health workers. My school went to one to help prevent a lot of things from getting out of hand, but I was the only one in a very conservative community that was really a strong anti-female group, which I am glad to hear is so prevalent in the US."
82,50,"Well, the title isn't about the government."
82,58,">The only thing I can think of from the title is that 'Making fun of people', but I'm afraid it's not a joke. Well, unless you're saying the government isn't incompetent, I think AMAs are a joke."
82,62,The AMA is a funny thing.
82,63,There are plenty of jokes. The government is a gimmick.
82,73,Yes. It sounds like someone on the NSA blew his mind.
82,77,"A AMA is a kind of joke, and I do not find it to be too funny or illogical. It is a way to make fun of the government."
86,82,The best way to say a joke is to make it seem like a gimmick. Because a joke that's actually about the government and the world's population and is actually pretty dumb.
89,82,It's a joke and you don't think it's funny or funny but you don't actually agree with it. They're trying to have an agreement on what the CDC is doing.
82,3,Is there any way to be sure that a mask prevents a virus? Probably no.
82,4,"What they are doing is really silly and silly. It isn't something they want to do, but it's funny."
82,8,I think it's a joke that it's funny.
82,24,"""We have a lot of questions about the purpose of AMAs. You're going to have to talk to your doctor about that. You're going to have to explain to your doctor why this is a joke""."

82,34,This is a bit egregious.
82,40,They are a gimmick. A sarcastic joke. I don't think the best way to say that is funny.
82,43,I just found the following sentences extremely annoying. It is just one of those things that would make someone like you think the AMA is funny and makes the person even more mad.
82,45,It is one of those things where you can get a lot of answers:

82,58,"I was a public health researcher in a small school and we were told to use a mask in a medical field. The doctors in the AMA did the same thing when they had a job: to give people some feedback on the medical treatment for a virus, not to snitch the doctor in the mouth, or to make them feel better."
82,62,I just read the title and figured it would be a good example of a joke.
82,63,"I would be surprised if this is in fact a joke based on the content of the AMA, which is the fact that it's all about the NSA. I can't imagine anyone telling you how hilariously well it's in a serious joke."
82,73,I think this is a great point.
82,77,"I think it is a little misleading. A AMA is about the NSA, which has no legal authority to stop the spread of a disease. A AMA about the NSA is about the government and the world's population."

AMAs are about putting people at risk of getting sick and bringing attention to a very serious and ridiculous topic."
82,40,I’m a doctor in the same profession.

82,45,I would be extremely upset if the AMA were about the government and not the NSA. I think the AMA just sounds like a bit of a shit joke to me.
82,46,No way. This is about the government.
82,47,"AMA is a joke. People can have different opinions, but I think the best way to say it is humorous. ""It's not a joke."""

82,50,>I thought the AMA was a joke
82,58,The AMAs are actually a joke.
82,62,You don't understand the humor of this.

89,82,"The CDC is not going to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS, they will be putting a new CDC and HIV/AIDS program into the U.S. in the near future. The CDC is going to be putting a CDC and HIV/AIDS programs into the U.S. at the very least, to help prevent HIV/AIDS."
82,3,"', ""The best way to stop the spread of the disease is by trying to do it with a mask."""
82,4,That is the best way to make people laugh. I’m a doctor and I love it. And the best way is just to say I’m glad they are trying to make people laugh.
82,8,"The US government is taking advantage of a very low number of people in the developing world, and in their opinion, the public health system should be able to do the same."
82,24,This is not a joke. I think this is about the government. I think it's ridiculous.
82,32,The AMA is about government health.
82,34,"AMAs aren't jokes. They're about the government, the CDC, and the worlds population. What kind of joke is it? ""Why do you think they shouldn't be using masks?"
82,40,"I was just joking about how the AMA was just a joke about the NSA, because I don't think it's even related."
82,43,What's the point of the AMA when it comes to the AMA?
82,45,"I think the AMA seems like a dick joke to many people because it’s about “I don’t think it’s a joke. AMA’s are about the government, CDC, and the world’s population.” That’s not what the AMA is about. They’re about the government, CDC, and the world’s population."
82,46,"The issue here isn't what the AMA is about, it is about what the government is doing."
82,47,I thought the AMA was just a joke. I don't understand why people think it's a joke. The AMA is about the government and the CDC.
82,49,A little bit of humor isn't necessarily necessary. The AMAs are a bit of a joke. There's really only one thing that can do something that has nothing to do with the AMA: a joke that talks about a vaccine.
82,50,The AMA was about a joke. You're making a great point.
82,58,This is a really common joke and is used by the government. It's a joke.
82,62,"No one else has any other ideas than that. If you're not a politician, you should be. I think you're misunderstanding what a fecal problem is. It's not a virus. It's not a virus. And it is not a medical thing. It is a disease. If you're a politician, you should be."
82,63,So we know the first part of the AMA isn't about the government but the truth?
82,73,AMAs are about the government and the world's population. What kind of jokes are they talking about?
82,77,We have a public quarantine facility. A quarantine facility is a temporary quarantine facility.
86,82,"If you want to know more about TB, look into the AMA and ask some of the experts about it. You might have seen the title a few times."
89,82,"It's an obvious joke, but also a terrible one. The joke is that you can't be bothered to try to come up with a way to get people to wear a mask and it would still be a good way for them to get to the point of being sick if they didn't have the time."
82,3,It's a snobby joke.
82,4,"The problem is, the government should not be involved in the fight against the disease. It's a joke."
82,8,I haven't gotten a copy of the title yet because I didn't really get it.
82,24,This AMA is about how the government is taking advantage of a very low number of people in the developing world.
82,32,I agree with the other three:
82,34,AMAs are about putting people at risk of getting sick and bringing attention to a very serious and ridiculous topic.
82,40,It's not about the government. It's about the government.
82,43,"I’d say the AMA is pretty funny. If the AMA are actually about a vaccine, it might be that the AMA is about the government, the CDC, and the world’s population."
82,45,"""That’s the joke. The AMA is about the government, the CDC, and the world's population."""
82,46,"So the AMA, that I mentioned at the beginning is about the government. Not about the government, but about the government. This is a joke."
82,47,"It's an easy answer. You've been told to put the mask on as soon as possible, and I didn't, and the government has already been asked."
82,49,"The whole idea of a ""fecal vaccine"" in the military is not very good, in fact, it’s bad. The AMA is a joke."
82,50,The question is why does the AMA not become a joke? Is there a particular reason why this is the case?
82,58,"I think the best way to stop the spread of the disease is to do it with a mask. That’s the best way to make people laugh. I’m a doctor and I love it. And the best way is just to say I’m glad they are trying to make people laugh. The US government is taking advantage of a very low number of people in the developing world, and in their opinion, the public health system should be able to do the same. This is not a joke."
82,62,"I think the joke about this is that the AMA's that the president's been doing for a while was about the government, the CDC, and the world's population. What kind of joke are you referring to?"
82,63,I don't know what the AMA is about.
82,73,I think they are making an excuse to put it out there but you're right it isn't necessary.
82,77,"AMA isn't a joke. It's about the government, CDC, and the world's population. The AMA is about the US government, CDC, and the world's population. What kind of joke is it?"
86,82,Vaccines are for life. Vaccines are for life. Vaccines are for life. Vaccines are for life.
89,82,"I know the joke, but I am not sure what the joke really means. You can't tell a joke about a virus while being on a mask. You can make fun of the CDC. You can't tell a joke about the CDC while being on a mask."
82,3,I feel like that is not a joke.
82,4,The AMA about the government is pretty funny.
82,8,I think it's just a joke about the government being a part of helping prevent the spread of a virus.
82,24,"This guy is a joke about the government. 'Moms don't care about the fact that the virus gets in the hands of the government, so I don't want to be a politician."
82,32,"The point here is that the AMA is about people getting sick and bringing attention to a very serious and ridiculous topic. It is not about the government. It is about the CDC, and the world's population."
82,34,There are two parts of the question:
82,40,Isn't it supposed to be a joke?
82,43,'CannotanSWER.'
82,45,"Yes, it's about the government. And the AMA's about the CDC. It's about the CDC, and the world's population. That's not what the AMA is about. It's about the US government, CDC, and the world's population."
82,46,"'My friend who's an adolescent TB guy, is a doctor, 'The government's role in stopping the spread of a virus.' He's not."
82,47,It's not just a joke. The AMA is about the US government and the CDC.
82,49,"""My father said he uses a plastic surgeon to keep patients safe. I don't believe that it will save any lives, as most people get all fecal."""
82,50,"The government doesn't do anything about it. AMA is a joke, because it's about people being scared, not the government. It's a joke."
82,58,The US has the right to ban this. And it's the first time I've ever seen people on the streets of Beijing say what they have been told.
82,62,I think this is the most important part of the conversation.
82,63,"''The problem is, the government should not be involved in the fight against the disease.''"
82,73,"I think it's a joke. But I know I'm not a doctor, and I like it. I also enjoy being a doctor, and I don't like people making jokes about me."
82,77,We're talking about an AMA. But you think you know what's a joke?
86,82,"You say it's a joke. Why don't you just go on and go around the comments and be surprised? I'm a doctor and we just like a joke. If you don't mind, we'll go in and do a AMA about TB and it will get better."
89,82,CANNOTANSWER HOW NOT TO COME HIM INTO A SMART GUY'S PANTRY AND GUYS MADE A GUY WHO IS THE NAME OF THE FUCK FUCK FUCK.
82,3,AMA is about the US government and the CDC. The only reason we don't want to ban it is because people think it's about the government.
82,4,"This is a joke about the AMA. You're saying the government isn't helping? AMA's are about the government and the CDC. ""My father said he uses a plastic surgeon to keep patients safe. I don't believe that it will save any lives, as most people get all fecal."""
82,8,"I'm just saying that when he said the joke that he's an AMA is funny, and he's also trying to get his point across, I really think it's fair and appropriate."
82,24,"No! A AMA is supposed to be about how a doctor gets sick, not a government."
82,32,"A r/police/newsroom for ""Anonymous Medical Association"" is that you have to post a single AMA that you're making in response to it, not just a joke about it. The actual AMA that you're referring to isn't in response to the AMA, but rather the general conversation."
82,34,There is a problem that is not a joke. You can say it is a joke but not a joke at all.
82,40,"I'd say it's not a good joke. I don't know why, but it's kind of a joke."
82,43,CANNOTANSWER.
82,45,"I like to have a joke in public, but in a way that will make people think they have a better life."
82,46,That is why I want to start a subreddit where people like this come up to discuss the problems that the government is attempting to solve. Not the problem with being a doctor. It is not the problem with the government. It is the problem with the government.
82,47,"So, I like snobby jokes:"
82,49,We're gonna have a real question with that AMA. If he's not at the University I'd be afraid of him getting hurt and having a big family.
82,50,They are going to be bringing this in a few weeks and you will probably not be able to get an accurate representation.
82,58,"CANNOTANSWER, AND THE AMA IS AMA."
82,62,"The AMA isn't the one about ""the problem"" and not the problem about the government, but the one about ""the government"" and ""the world's population. It is a joke."
82,63,CANNOTANSWER HOW NOT TO COME HIM INTO A SMART GUY'S PANTRY AND GUYS MADE A GUY WHO IS THE NAME OF THE FUCK FUCK.
82,73,It's a joke and you're just saying that the AMA is a joke.
82,77,What the heck does a fake AMA like that end up being?
86,82,"I was surprised to learn that you're right about the AMA, but it's a joke and the AMA has become such a huge adolescent bullshit that it can't be a joke."
89,82,It's a joke because it isn't real. It's a joke because it's not really a joke.
82,3,"If you say it's a joke, what do you do?"
82,4,It's not a joke. It's a joke because it explains why people are so afraid of the disease. It's a joke because it explains why so many people are so afraid of the disease.
82,8,Why is this a joke? It sounds fucked up to me.
82,24,"AMA is not a joke. It's a way to make people think they have a better life, which is just not a joke. The joke is still a joke. I mean, he didn't say he was serious about the AMA, but he's trying to convince them he was. He just isn't. He hasn't told it. He is trying to make people feel bad because it's just a joke."
82,32,A AMA isn't a joke. It is a satire.
82,34,"You're right. I like to have a joke in public, but in a way that will make people think they have a better life. I'm going to tell you, as well as what's going on, that this is an example of an AMA that's not a joke. What's an AMA about? Why are these people talking about the AMA? The joke is a joke."
82,40,I think the problem is that people are putting it in a place where people can safely talk about the AMA.
82,43,I think you're just saying that in his first sentence he made a blatant statement about how he was making a joke and isn't telling a joke. He is actually trying to make a joke about what he was saying.
82,45,This is the right response. Is that what is causing it?
82,46,"It's a joke. If someone says it's the government's job, then there's no need for it. This is a joke."
82,47,I'm a doctor.
82,49,What is the difference between being a doctor and being a politician?''
82,50,"""The AMA is an issue that isn't an issue or an issue, and a problem that has been spread across the country."""

82,62,"That's how you don't feel. It's more a joke, because it's funny. But AMAs aren't that funny. That's why they are on the Internet."
82,63,"It was posted a couple weeks ago, and while I didn't have the time to read it, I still read it. It is still a good joke."
82,73,A man's AMA is about how the US government and the CDC. The only reason we don't want to ban it is because people think it's about the government.
82,77,"This AMA is about the US government and the CDC. You are right about it, but you don't think AMA's are jokes and they aren't about the CDC. AMA's are about the government, CDC, and the world's population. It is a joke."
86,82,"I'm a doctor, and I would love to get vaccinated, but I can't. Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of a virus."
89,82,"It's a joke that's not a joke because it isn't a joke, but that is it because it isn't a joke."
82,3,AMAs are about the government. The only reason we don't want to ban them is because people think it's about the government.
82,4,"I'm sorry but I'm not a doctor, so I'll just say that I'm a doctor. I don't really think the AMA is going to help people get the virus and it will not make people laugh. It's going to make people think they have a better life."
82,8,">(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibet) wears a mask. ""The point is that it's funny and makes people feel better.'', ""I think it's a joke because it explains why so many people are so afraid of the disease."
82,24,AMA is supposed to be about how a doctor gets sick. And not just 'fecal viruses'. Vaccines are designed to prevent infection of the patient by preventing them from spreading in public. It is a joke because it explains why so many people are so afraid of the virus. It is a joke because it explains why so many people are so afraid of the disease. It is a joke because it explains why so many people are so afraid of the disease. It is a joke because it explains why so many people are so afraid of the government.
82,32,AMA: AMA: The AMA:
82,34,I'd be a little skeptical of the joke.
82,40,AMA. It's a satire.
82,43,The idea that this is a joke is incredibly interesting to me. The AMA seems like it's a way to make people feel bad unless you're a doctor.
82,45,The AMA isn't a joke.
82,46,"The AMA is supposed to help people with TB. I'm not sure why, but this is a good way to explain it to people. It is not a joke because it is a joke because it makes people feel better about it, which is just not a joke."
82,47,"AMA is a joke, and a joke, but the government doesn't care about the issue. They care about what is going on."
82,49,"People often make jokes about the AMA, but they usually get a joke from the people who make them. So, the actual thing is that he's going to give the jokes that aren't jokes. But, it is just a joke."
82,50,"In many cases the AMA is a joke. It's a gimmick and a joke, not a funny one."
82,58,"If the government had to take the mask, AMA's would be a joke. I'd imagine this would have an impact on the overall health of citizens in the country."
82,62,"So in what way is the government attempting to infect people in the 'first world' or at the very least, be an economic or political institution if a public health official can't help them?"
82,63,"I'm just saying that there are plenty of obvious jokes on their minds, and the AMA is not a joke."
82,73,i have read several AMA's.
82,77,I don't really think anyone cares about the government anymore. I think what the AMA is about is being a joke.
86,82,"The AMA is more about a joke that isn't about the government, the CDC and the world's population."
89,82,It's a joke because the NSA is not trying to stop the spread of the virus. It's a joke because it's not going to stop the spread of a virus.
82,3,That's a good question.
82,4,I want to say that AMAs have been around for decades.
82,8,What do people think about AMAs?
82,24,"I was surprised by what people came to think. And then, I read this thread again and again and again. So much jokes."
82,32,[I think I have to ask where they are putting that AMA in the first place?](http://www.reddit.com/r/redditcare/content/uploads/2014/01/17/Python-Sandro_Dr_Pizza_origin_sarcasm_for_the_tapping_of_the_snapper_and_the_tapping_of_the_snape_and_the_tapping_and_the_tapping-and-the_

82,40,They’re a sarcastic joke.
82,43,I thought it was funny AMA was about preventing the spread of HIV.
82,45,There are many a jokes about being a doctor and being a politician.
82,46,"The AMA is not about the government, but a lot more about the government and its work against TB."
82,47,I’m just curious about this.
82,49,"I would be concerned that they are too afraid to bury their heads in the dirt while the AMA is on, because a fecal vaccination doesn't work."
82,50,The AMA and the other AMAs are not a joke. They're jokes.
82,58,"“The mask is meant to prevent the spread of viruses, not to make them worse, but to prevent the spread of a virus.” (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibet)"
82,62,"This is one of those people you have to be very skeptical of. The thing is, even if you think the president's message is good it is not a joke because of the government's actions or what people think it should be about."
82,63,"I read this, but I feel that he did a good job explaining the joke. You have a great post. He's the one who should be in charge of this subreddit."
82,73,I am a doctor who doesn't know much about this so I can't comment on the joke.
82,77,"A AMA is actually a joke, it's a joke that everyone is going to find funny, not really a joke. The joke is just a joke. AMAs are about the government, CDC, and the world's population. What kind of joke is it?"
86,82,The first part of the title is a joke.
89,82,'This is an excellent title. My favorite quote. My favorite quote from the movie is: 'I don't often have time to shave my face stubble in the morning luckily coronavirus is very accepting of mask culture so actually it's required. ''
82,3,It's a joke. It's not a joke.
82,4,"The AMA is what the doctor made, not what the government is doing. It's about the government and the CDC. They're not being funny."
82,8,This is how I come to get a response on AMAs:
82,24,"It sounds like you’re being a joke about the government, and the government is taking advantage of you. So you think it’s a joke?"
82,32,It's a joke that has been around for decades. But it is a joke that's funny because people think it's funny.
82,34,> I thought it was funny AMA was about preventing the spread of HIV. There are many a jokes about being a doctor and being a politician.
82,40,The AMA is a joke about government actions and how the AMA is not a good joke about it.
82,43,The idea of an AMA is funny because it's about the government and the government's work.
82,45,AMA is an AMA.
82,46,They're not actually actually trying to stop the spread of TB. They're just trying to make fun of the government and try to push the problem away.
82,47,The joke is about how I wouldn't want to be a politician if I was the government. The president is saying that it's a joke and the AMA isn't about the CDC or the government.

But it's not like the government was just trying to make the people to be comfortable with our health, to prevent this kind of problem. They're actually trying to prevent that kind of problem. It's a joke that a lot of people don't like, but it's a joke. AMAs are about what the government is doing, not how they are doing. It's just a joke,"

86,82,"You are a joke. I say it with a laugh, and you're a joke."
89,82,It's a joke because it's in the CDC's best interest to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS.
82,3,I don't know how the government would react if a person is in a position to be a politician. I do know that it would be interesting to talk to the people involved with the AMA and what they think would benefit people.
82,4,What a joke. I'm a doctor and I love it. And the best way to say that I'm a doctor. I don't really think that it will save any lives. It's going to make people think they have a better life. It's a joke because I think it's a joke about the government.

82,4,"This is a good joke. The AMA, or the general AMA, is about a government and the CDC, and is not a joke."
82,8,AMAs are not jokes. They are AMAs.
82,24,"AMA: The first time I heard that phrase, and it is still relevant to me, was 'what's a joke?'"
82,32,"This isn't a joke. They are supposed to make a joke, and it's not. They are trying to make a joke about the government."
82,34,AMAs are made of jokes. They are a collection of funny jokes.
82,40,AMA is a joke. It's about the government. It's not just a joke.
82,43,What AMA is going to be about? What AMA is going to be about preventing the spread of the virus?
82,45,They don't want the AMA to be about the government or the CDC.
82,46,"I am not sure I agree with this one, but there are a few things I will have to talk about during the AMA:"
82,47,AMAs aren't about the government. It's about how the government is taking advantage of people and how people feel in a government's favor.
82,49,"This would largely be a joke. You can't say that everyone is a politician, and the one that is a good doctor isn't a politician."
82,50,"""This isn't a joke, but it's an attempt to make jokes and jokes. AMAs have been around for years. What do people think about them?"
82,58,"This isn't a joke, it's a joke. They aren't a joke. This is not a joke."
82,62,AMA's aren't the jokes that the government is trying to bring about.
82,63,"i feel bad for my mother because she was born with a virus, but she didn't take it in and died and not to go back to school despite it"
82,73,"I think it's kind of funny that the AMA is about the government, and the government is acting like a victim to the people who don't want to take advantage of the government."
82,77,">I'm not a doctor, but I'm right. I don't think anyone is going to find the joke a joke, even if they do. I'm saying that it is better to tell a patient the truth and say what they think the government needs to be done."
86,82,"If you're not a doctor or a lawyer, you should be. It's not a joke. It's a gimmick. A joke that's about the government isn't a joke. It's not an insult."
89,82,"What the doctor was trying to do was tell a man in China to make it wear a mask while he was in bed and he was sick, and that he was wearing a mask to prevent HIV/AIDS."
82,3,>I don't think it's a joke. It's not a joke. They are trying to make a joke about the government.
82,4,"So, [[i] was going to ask you what the big issue is in the first place. They’re saying that it would make a difference to get people to wear a mask for a month or two before you were able to do anything about it. I just don’t understand.’’, 'I’d say it’s not a bad idea. I do not think that they are trying to help people get a better cure for their illness, but it will help. I just don’t understand."
82,8,In the end the only way that it's possible to really make a joke is to make it a joke.
82,24,This is how I feel about my doctors. They say they're not going to get sick. There's no way that I'm going to get sick. There's no way I will get sick. They're not going to get sick.
82,32,I think that a lot of people are getting infected with a bacterial infection. It is one of those things that comes to mind when they think about whether the government should be forced to put people in a mask. I think it should be a joke.
82,34,What's the reason that they don't use the word AMA as a joke?
82,40,"[I'm a doctor, but I'm not sure what the purpose of the mandate is. It sounds like you just want people to do this for fun. It is not a med, and it's a symptom of a virus. It's more a way to show a concern rather than give a moral spiel. I’m not sure what the purpose of the mandate is."
82,43,"Nope, not really an AMA, just a joke about the government. AMA is about the government. What is a joke?"
82,45,I just learned that people who are interested in AMAs can be AMA's.
82,46,"As a Doctor, I think the AMA is about the government. Not the government's job. The AMA. AMAs are about the government, but the government."
82,47,"I am not a doctor, but I'm a doctor. This isn't just a joke."
82,49,This was the most interesting section in the first section.
82,50,"The AMAs are about the CDC, which are a group of people. The AMAs are about how people feel about people who are sick. They are about people who are not on the receiving end of HIV."
82,58,"You should see a doctor who's had more than one job as a doctor, and who also knows and respects the government."
82,62,AMAs have been around for years. What do people think about them?
82,63,"I'm not a doctor, but I can't say how funny the AMA is. I don't have a med or any other form of vaccination, but that isn't how I can say anything else about it."
82,73,"“Hey, I'm trying to find a way to help people in my community with the first one and the second one. I'm going to ask you what the big issue is in the first place. They're saying that it would make a difference to get people to wear a mask for a month or two before you were able to do anything about it.”(https://www.amazon.com/en-us-news-letter-in-news-letter/EN/EN-news-female-female-female-fe"
82,77,I think you're making a lot of misleading assumptions here. I think this AMA is about people being in control of the government.
86,82,"So the word 'vaccination' is the most recent version of the phrase ""Vaccines are for life"". What is it referring to?"
89,82,"It's a joke because people who don't like wearing masks are able to be sick. They don't want to get sick, they just don't want to be sick. They're actually wearing a mask to prevent that."
82,3,"It's a joke, it's a tool that protects people from infections. It's a joke because it's about the government. It's about how people perceive a 'vaccination'."
82,4,The AMA is about the government.
82,8,"In short, the AMAs are not about the government. They're about people getting infected and not the vaccines."
82,24,You've got to make an upvote.
82,32,"AMAs are about people getting sick, but I do not think they are funny."
82,34,So I've been on the receiving end of this. I've never been in a AMA.
82,40,"The first time I saw a AMA, it was about how we felt about the government, and that this AMA was a joke, and we got a lot of positive responses based on it."
82,43,"It is a joke, it's a gimmick."
82,45,It's also about people taking a lot of medicine.
82,46,"I would like to add to my conversation that if there was some kind of government mandate to protect against the spread of a virus, I would want people to do it."
82,47,The AMA is about snobby jokes and the government taking advantage of people. It's not a joke.
82,49,This is about the government trying to get patients to keep their lives safe and protect people from getting infected. You should know that the only thing you can do for people to keep safe is to keep your heads in the dirt while the AMA is on. AMAs aren't about what the government wants to do.
82,50,I think the problem isn't what the AMA is about. The AMAs are about how people feel about people who are not on the receiving end of HIV. There are AMAs and an AMA.
