And then later my friends came to find the mask, and said \"well, I just go with the face out on my face\". And then it took them a minute to get them to stop spreading the virus and not just a bunch of people, and a few of them came up with some funny jokes. I can't even remember if it was a joke that sexist and I'm going to do the same thing",
