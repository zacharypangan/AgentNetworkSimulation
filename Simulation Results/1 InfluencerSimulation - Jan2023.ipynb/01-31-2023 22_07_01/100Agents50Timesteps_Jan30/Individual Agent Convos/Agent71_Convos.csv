83,71,those who want to protect themselves from getting sick have every right to masks keep you more safe than no mask in tight settings everyone has the right to do whatever they want now at their discretion
89,71,i don t often have time to shave my face stubble in the morning luckily coronavirus is very accepting of mask culture so actually it s required
93,71,excellent exandle of the importance and reliance of everyone in the community to do their part the people that put themselves at risk everyday so you can have food safely produced and delivered to you to eat it s not hard to wear a mask on a run
101,71,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
71,3,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
83,71,"If you run in tight settings, you don't have to wear a mask because you're running in tight places."
89,71,"So I don't get sick. I've seen people like you shave their face and then use the brush to cut it out of their body and hair, so I don't know what to do."
93,71,So what's the joke about the people wearing a mask for the first 10 minutes of a run?
101,71,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
71,3,"Wearing a mask on a run does not help in stopping the spread of a virus. If you run in tight settings, you don't have to wear a mask because you're running in tight places. So I don't get sick.

So what's the joke about the people wearing a mask for the first 10 minutes of a run?"
83,71,This is the thing that people always want to know about!
89,71,"I have a mask on, and I use it for a shaven face."
93,71,People wearing a mask on a run is the biggest misconception.
101,71,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."

83,71,"It's a joke! The word that comes up is, ""I have to wear a mask on a run. That's nice of you!"""
89,71,"> When I went to a movie, my friend gave me a mask for the first time in a long time, and the same thing happened in the movie if you don't know me, and he didn't know me, and it's a little weird but my friend was still wearing one when he was young. I remember he went fucking crazy and I'd get a lot of funny faces on the film. I said to Wearing masks does not help in stopping the spread of a virus."
93,71,A very old joke and a new one at the same time. But one is that when people wear a mask they are taking advantage of a joke because of how it is funny and it makes them feel good.
101,71,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
71,3,"We've got the new ""I have to wear a mask on a run."" It's a joke! The word that comes up is, ""I have to wear a mask on a run. That's nice of you!"""
83,71,Honestly I don't see a big enough difference here between wearing a mask on a job and having a mask on a new home. I don't see a big enough difference here between wearing a mask on a job and having a mask on a new home.
89,71,"So, I went out to dinner and made a facial mask and hid in my mouth, and then I got this nasty worm and I didn't wear it?"
93,71,It's really an old joke. I thought you were saying that if santa was wearing a mask and got into a run then he would have done that at least 10 minutes before it was noticed.
101,71,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
71,3,It's kind of a silly joke and it's one of those things that makes me wonder how people are thinking. But they wear their masks for a reason.
83,71,Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww.fwdr.fl.gov/comments/5/AssistantAssistantAssistantAssistantA Honestly I don't see a big enough difference here between wearing a mask on a job and having a mask on a new home.
89,71,... or is it just something that seems like it would work for them?
93,71,"There is a good joke in there as well. If someone were wearing a mask on a run then they are putting themselves at risk, a joke can be made, but the actual joke isn't sarcastic. It's about taking advantage of a joke. It's also about the jokes that people make on the run, especially if they're very fast and have no other way of telling the joke."
101,71,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
71,3,I’m gonna guess I’ve been doing this since the beginning of the year. It’s just been really nice
83,71,"I think people who want to protect themselves are not allowed to wear a mask on the job, because it's the most important thing to protect themselves from spreading a virus."
89,71,"You should have said that. You shouldn't have asked him if it worked, because it sounds like it'd help. If not, I don't want to see you in a movie or any of my friends, who wear them, do what you want. Do you want to know why they keep wearing them?"
93,71,"Well, I just noticed that on a run last week, and the first time I heard it, I had to say, ""Ah, that's funny, I didn't think I could do that."""

93,71,Is there a joke about the people who put themselves in a funk?
101,71,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
71,3,"In the US, a person can wear a mask when they are in a funk."
83,71,"They aren't legal, it's not illegal. And they aren't."
89,71,"The joke is made to make the doctor feel like he was in the right and there's not anything wrong with it. If there's nothing wrong with a joke that doesn't make people feel like they're being the victim of some sort of attack, it's a joke that's actually a joke."
93,71,It sounds like you don't even know what a funk is.
101,71,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
71,3,"Wearing a mask on a run, on a run, is very different from a normal person. The fact that one wears a mask on a run is more than a joke."
83,71,It's actually a joke. I mean the government has some great policies that do the same thing. Like having to be in a hospital to go get some antibiotics or something. I don't like my job so I'll wear a mask.
89,71,"""Wow, I'm so sick, I have the flu. I don't wear a mask because I don't have time to shave my face. I haven't got much time to do that."""

89,71,"If this is a joke, then I don't care because I'm a doctor and you're a doctor - it's not a joke."
93,71,"I've had to say that that was an awesome idea, but I think it's a rip off. Like a movie or a fable. I think this movie is funny."
101,71,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
71,3,"I don't know why I'm getting downvoted, but the way they were phrased I was that it's a joke and they are both valid issues."
83,71,They aren't legally required. They aren't legally required.
89,71,"I think the point of wearing masks is to make people feel bad. It's not the government, it's the people who get sick."
93,71,"I hate to say it but i can attest that it's pretty great and has an original message, so i'll keep it :)"
101,71,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
