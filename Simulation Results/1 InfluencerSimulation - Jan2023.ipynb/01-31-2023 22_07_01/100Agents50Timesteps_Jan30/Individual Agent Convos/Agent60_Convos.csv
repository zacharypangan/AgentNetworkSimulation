60,12,"Yes, but it doesn't change anything. The more people who wear a mask, the more vulnerable they become to the infection, which in turn reduces the risk of the infection. Besides, the person is less likely to die from an infection because the mask is actually better to treat."

60,2,I know that's funny but I think the person wearing the mask to be able to prevent the spread of the virus is one of the first people to know what a mask is and the others to know what a mask is.

60,50,"You see what he's saying is a joke, but isn't it a joke? And he has an idea of a new way to stop a virus by wearing a mask over someone else."
60,52,...and it's actually a really good idea to put a mask on after a while.
60,56,"No, the people who wear a mask aren't the ones who go about wearing a mask and bend over. They wear a mask and bend over. They wear a mask and bend over. The government doesn't really do that."
68,60,"The only thing I can think of that I do for myself is wear a mask, and my nose. I think the idea of a face mask is not what I've ever done for myself, but when I do something for my kids, my face gets very unreliable."
69,60,I don't know how he got out of the hospital.
75,60,"> I'm a woman who is allergic to children, and they have to be vaccinated. It’s a joke, but a joke."
78,60,"I agree with the others here, but the whole idea of wearing a mask is just wrong."
83,60,"The fact that you need to have a mask on the run route in your car is pretty significant. Basically, you're just going to need a mask to protect yourself when it comes to getting sick. If the vaccine wasn't effective, I'd get it, but my local public health department will be there."

60,43,You guys are a joke. You need a mask to stop the spread of the virus.
60,49,"And then, at the last minute, the government shows up."
60,50,"Yes, he is going to put a mask on himself. We need to see him."
60,52,"It's not just a joke, it's a fact. It's a joke, but it doesn't make sense to everyone."
60,56,"Well, I think you need to make a mental note: You are essentially saying that the person who was trying to prevent the spread of the virus is the one who did it. And this isn't a joke."
68,60,I do not wear masks for kids (if I'm not mistaken) or for the people with the virus if I amn't vaccinated.
69,60,"I think your characterization of this is a bit shady, but I don't think anyone would want to hear it as an obvious reference to someone who was vaccinated."
75,60,"I'm not sure how many people are being treated with the word ""jail"" in the language of the article. Vaccines are not needed in the US. But it has to do with pandemics."
78,60,>I think there's a lot of people that wear a mask on a daily basis and its hard to imagine not having a run.
83,60,This is the thing that people always want to know about! I think we need more fads. But it's actually pretty easy to give them an incentive to be more protective than the government. Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww.fwdr.fl.gov/comments/5/AssistantAssistantAssistantAssistantAssistantAssistantAssistantAssistantAssistantAssistantA
60,2,"It's a fad that isn't a joke. People who don't wear a mask tend to be more inclined to accept this. Until something like this, they can't be able to stop a spread."
60,8,We need a few fads.
60,12,The government has a mission to stop the spread of viruses. They do not like the idea of it. They aren't interested in helping. The problem is that they don't want to help.
60,17,The fact that you have to wear a mask in your car is the most worrying aspect to me.
60,18,">I think he has a point. I don't really think people are asking him to do anything wrong, and he has some interesting views on the topic."
60,31,A person's stance on the topic of the government and how to prevent a virus is to go as far as a non-vaccinated person. That's a nonsense. It makes me sad that the government could help the government stop spreading viruses and is so anti-vaccinating. The government is not the ones who are actually threatening people.
60,43,They fucking made me have a bad dream.
60,49,You need to wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend over Please
60,50,We need to see this guy more.
60,52,"The joke's a bit of a shill and I think it's not as shady as the other commenters. It's not really a joke, it's more like an actual fact."
60,56,The government isn't doing anything that is in the public interest. The problem is people like you are making an obvious point about the government. I've never heard of the government that doesn't do that.
68,60,Wearing a mask to prevent people from getting sick from a virus and not having vaccinated.
69,60,Why don't people wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus?
75,60,I think the joke is a joke.
78,60,"I think you're being kind of jaded. A lot of people say ""Wearing a mask can stop the spread of the virus, so it's not just necessary."" (Meshwashing is a very useful thing) but it's an extremely unpopular idea."
83,60,"I work at the government and I think if it's the right thing to do, you can go, but you'd have to pay a decent salary to get a job."
60,2,"""Wearing a mask can stop the spread of a virus, so it's not just necessary."""
60,8,It's a fad that isn't a joke. People who don't wear a mask on a daily basis and its hard to imagine not having a run. This is the thing that people always want to know about! I think we need a few fads. The government has a mission to stop the spread of viruses. They do not like the idea of it. They aren't interested in helping. The problem is that they don't want to help. The problem is that they aren't helping. It's
60,12,I've been exposed to alot of viruses. What is it?
60,17,I'm not saying the article isn't a joke. I am suggesting you can tell us the story of one of the people who has a facial mask on.
60,18,This is just a little annoying. They want to cut the risk. It's a 'fad'.
60,31,I didn't realize it was the government.
60,43,I don't know how this is even a joke. I'm just looking at the top comments. You're a very smart guy.
60,49,i thought the joke was shady..?
60,50,"You're being kind of jaded. I've never heard of the government that doesn't do that. Wearing a mask can stop the spread of the virus, so it's not just necessary."
60,52,"It sounds like the government has something to offer people, even if it is in fact a joke. The fact that people need to wear a mask in the car is a big red flag."
60,56,"I know that the most annoying part of this is people don't want to see this guy. But, you know what I mean. It's not really a joke."
68,60,">The only thing I can think of that I do for myself is wear a mask, and my nose. I think the idea of a mask is not what I've ever done for myself, but when I do something for my kids, my face gets very unreliable."
69,60,"I read some sarcastic, but I'm not going to be a dick about this."
75,60,Because I hate pandemics. I'm a pandemic victim and I'm a pandemic victim.
78,60,"I feel like I am being sort of jaded about that, but I think it's funny."
83,60,Vaccines are illegal. And they are not legal. And they aren't required.
60,2,"You don't have to wear a mask if you're bitten by a virus. A person can't. Unless you're bitten by the virus (because you've already got it, you've got to do it), you're probably not going to be protected by a mask. A sex of any kind is considered the same thing."
60,8,[The Government has a mission to stop the spread of viruses. They do not like the idea of it. They aren't interested in helping. The problem is that they aren't helping. The problem is that they aren't helping.
60,12,Is wearing a mask what you mean? I'm a doc and I'm going to wear a mask on me in the future. It's the best way to prevent the spread of a virus. We've been tasked with a mission to stop the spread of a virus.
60,17,"I'm trying to talk this up, but I am looking for some answers. Do you need a break?"
60,18,"I don't know if it's a joke or not, but it's a very popular joke. We've all been there. I wear a mask. Vaccines are illegal, and they're not legal. But they're not required."
60,31,That's a fad. It doesn't make any sense. The fad has nothing to do with the government. It's about the people who are immune.
60,43,Nope. The government needs a face mask.
60,49,No I don't know. This is a joke.
60,50,"It sounds like the government has something to offer people, even if it is in fact a joke."
60,52,I didn't like it.
60,56,"I can relate to the guy, he's trying to do something for us (like get our face a crinkle) and I want to be able to wear a mask. I've seen people doing that. I hate it and don't want to be around other people and people in the US who think it's a joke and don't see what it's about."
68,60,"It's not a joke. It's a crappy AMA. The government doesn't want to protect kids. This is why they don't use the term ""mask""."
69,60,It doesn't say that the government is trying to stop it.
75,60,What a crazy guy! Honestly I'd be mad at him if I didn't have health insurance.
78,60,">I feel like I am being sort of jaded about that, but I think it's funny. I feel like I am being kind of harsh."
83,60,This is not what it seems to be.
60,2,"The joke is not that the person who wears a mask needs to wear it, but that if you are bitten by a virus you have to wear a mask. You aren't bitten by a virus. Unless you are bitten by the virus you need to wear a mask. It is the government's job to help stop a spread of the virus. It is not funny. It is funny."
60,8,I like to think the people who are immune have more power over the government.

60,17,"I have never seen anyone have to wear a mask or something. I am not a doctor and I am not comfortable with this, and I don't have to care for the government's policies that protect the public from their afflictions. It's just not me, I can relate to the people that are wearing a mask, and I don't want to hear anyone say they should, and it's not worth it."
60,18,">I feel like I am being sort of jaded about that, but I think it's funny."
60,31,I'd love to know what you're thinking.
60,43,"I can't imagine that a person on the internet could do this to you, or have a face mask for a living. I don't see how you'd even need to be a doc for the entire video."
60,49,You're being very harsh.
60,50,I was joking. I was really joking. It’s not a joke. It’s an AMA. It’s a crappy joke. It’s a joke. It’s a joke.
60,52,You don't have to wear a mask to protect your skin from a pandemic. You don't need a mask to protect you from getting a pandemic. You do not have to wear a mask.
60,56,"If it's a joke, it's a joke. And not just for a joke. Whether or not you want to be around others doesn't matter."
68,60,">The government has a mandate, which is to not wear a mask in public places, but to wear a mask in public and not to fap themselves."
69,60,They're not going to be able to stop a virus until after it's spread. So I don't think it's a good idea to make a joke out of it unless there's a lot of other people involved.
75,60,"Yeah, the joke is actually a joke. But not really a joke in my opinion. I'm not a doctor, but I know what you mean."
78,60,"I'm not a doctor, but I do have a job at a hospital and I'd go to the doctor and see if anyone was interested in the situation. Vaccines are for life."
83,60,"I agree with you that ''The Man in the Hat'' is a reworking of the book and I think it's interesting that this is an extremely twisted version of the movie. It's very, very sad and interesting."
60,2,"I've always wanted to wear a mask, but I'm not sure how many people actually think that it would be funny to eat a human, or a cocky cocky cocky, and the first to know that it's a cocky cocky cocky cocky, or a cocky cocky cocky cocky thing to do to save the human body. I've only seen one person do this on my family and I'm sure if they do something like this I'll be in the future"
60,8,"I think he's trying to explain a joke, but he is trying to prove the point he was trying to make. The article is a spoof of the joke, and he's trying to do it because he's been using the a joke and he thinks it's funny."
60,12,What is this supposed to mean? I think the idea is ridiculous.
60,17,"I don't get why people do that, but the government and AMA don't talk about a certain topic. It's the one with the sarcasm."
60,18,"Vaccines are not mandatory. They are not a good idea to stop it because the people who wear a mask are more likely to get sick. This is a joke. I don't understand why anyone would want to say he needs to stop it, and I'm not a doctor."
60,31,I thought this was just a satire of the video's plot.
60,43,I want to have a fap myself in a mask as I believe it's a good idea to go in a hat on your face. Not be a joke.
60,49,A lot of things can make me feel pretty awful because of it - I'm a little uneasy.
60,50,A lot of these comments are actually the wrong kind.
60,52,He's been doing this for years. He's a jerk.
60,56,"They're actually not the problem, but it is a joke. This is a twisted version of the book. I think it's interesting that this is an extremely twisted version of the movie. It's very, very sad and interesting."
68,60,The government needs to be involved in preventing the spread of this virus.
69,60,"CANNOTANSWER – I can hardly imagine why people would be embarrassed if they saw someone say something like ""I'm not going to get the vaccine in the US. I've seen a virus on my hand."""
75,60,That's a joke!
78,60,"I read the book ""The Man in the Hat"" and I was very confused about the meaning of that."
83,60,"So you think I am making a joke based on my experience with the government in Florida, right?"
60,2,No. He's not a jerk.
60,8,"I want to rape the cocky cocky cocky cocky on my forehead, but I need a mask for it to be funny, and it is only about as funny as the picture in the book."
60,12,"The fact that this guy is using the word ""devil nut"" is very telling of the joke, as it is. It's actually a joke."
60,17,I think the AMA should make a joke about that.
60,18,You can't make a joke. He's a jerk. People make fun of him and they know he is a jerk.
60,31,A hr has been getting a lot of shit from people who do this and are not vaccinated. That's basically the whole point of the movie. The government should have known what it was and did.
60,43,"CANNOTANSWER – I can hardly imagine why people would be embarrassed if they saw someone say something like ""I'm not going to get the vaccine in the US. I've seen a virus on my hand."" That's a joke!"

68,60,"I hate that you use it as a joke, but the whole AMA is a joke, and you need to see a doctor."

60,17,And then you... You say it's funny? Because you're the one who made a joke and the government should have known what it was and did.
60,18,"Well, yes, we can have a joke. But if you don't want to be the jerk, then stop and be serious."
60,31,Isn't this a joke? Why are all of these things a joke?
60,43,"The fact that he is using the word ""devil nut"" is very telling of the joke, as it is. It's actually a joke."
60,49,I don't think the AMA should make a joke about this.
60,50,"He is a jerk, and a jerk. People say he's a jerk, and it's really funny how the government is so twisted and disingenuous."
60,52,Its just a joke. The only person who would use that to make fun of the government would be a devil nut.
60,56,You're so clever. You can put the hat on and have a nice looking look on it with a little humor. You can eat it and break it off and it's not funny.
68,60,"Its a joke. Its not a joke. The government doesn't want to protect kids. This is why they don't use the term ""mask"". I think that's very important to the cause of the virus."
69,60,"There's a whole host of things to worry about in the CDC, like people who wear masks at parties, and those who are ill prepared to catch the virus, or those who are afraid to look in public, but aren't ready to be vaccinated and the people who aren't ready for it."

60,12,I don't think he said anything that was offensive.
60,17,"As a kid wearing a mask at parties is an absolute joke and in most cases, it's a joke because you can't be comfortable wearing the mask. People who don't like this are people who aren't interested in a mask."
60,18,I've never even seen it. That's really crazy.
60,31,"People are being treated with the word jail as part of the CDC's mission to stop the spread of a virus, and this is one of many problems the government is having. There's nothing wrong with this or not, it's just not a joke."

60,49,You seem like a joke. Not really a joke. Those words are literally jive.
60,50,"I know many people who say it's a joke, but I don't have any idea if it's actually a joke, or if it's actually a joke."
60,52,I have a friend who wears a mask at parties. He is a member of the CDC and a hivemind. The fact he is wearing a mask means that he's been doing this for years. The guy is probably a jerk.
60,56,Vaccines are not needed. Vaccines are for life.
68,60,"It sounds like the government has an idea that it is a joke, but it really makes no sense because the government has nothing to do with preventing the spread of a virus."

60,50,"I'm sorry, but I am not a doctor."
60,52,"I'm going to assume that most people here know what the word ""joke"" means.

60,56,"""...The CDC is an obnoxious conspiracy theorist who tries to spread the truth while simultaneously accusing the government of infiltrating the national security system."
68,60,The AMA I see is the only way for anyone to know why this isn't a joke. It's a really bad one. The AMA I find funny in a lot of ways. If you read the article the AMA is misleading.
69,60,">This is one of the most popular jokes in the country. It's about the government enabling people to wear masks. It's a joke, you don't know what it's about."

60,18,I'm pretty sure this is one of those jokes that's funny about the government enabling people to wear masks. It's a really good idea to put on a mask and bend over and then not a joke.
60,31,I think I can think of a few ways to phrase it.
60,43,We are talking about the entire AMA sarcastic and sexist. That's a big deal.
60,49,"I don't know what a joke is, but this is a joke. The only thing that makes a AMA interesting is that it's not about the government. It's about the CDC. The jokes are about the government, not the government. It's about preventing the spread of a virus."
60,50,"I feel like the entire point of the joke is to make people think ""hey it's a funny joke, but it's just a joke."""
60,52,You're not going to be able to get past the idea of an AMA where they are making a joke about a joke.
60,56,"It is a joke. In fact, most people don't have a clue why it's such a joke. Honestly, it's probably the most humorous of the 3 articles on this subreddit to find the ""Journal"" joke to have all the trolls that are not in the AMA."
68,60,"My mother and a friend of mine both have a job as a doctor. If you have kids and you aren't vaccinated, a doctor will give you a medical certificate. Getting vaccinated will make you sick and it will prevent you from dying of the disease and it will prevent you from dying of it. So if you wear a mask, you are a patriot."
69,60,I don't know how to put that shit together. This is about a CDC CDC article that was ripped off in the book. The CDC CDC is basically a government company that is trying to protect people from viruses.
75,60,I don't see what a joke is as such. This is so uncharacteristically depressing to me. I think most people would have to if I didn't know how to say this: 'People don't want to get sick from a pandemic. Vaccines are not needed in the US. But it has to do with pandemics.'
78,60,Wearing a mask prevents the spread of the virus and prevents a number of illnesses. So you don't wear a mask when you are sick? You can't expect it to do it because it isn't effective.
83,60,Vaccines are not legally required to prevent spread of a virus. They aren't legally required unless you are a doctor.
60,2,"I'm not a jerk. You're an idiot. I'm going to assume that most people here know what the word ""joke"" means."
60,8,"It is not a joke, and the AMA is just about the government and its mission. That's why it is such a joke."
60,12,I'm a doc and I'm going to wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over
60,17,It's a joke. That is all that's being told.
60,18,I think it's a pretty hilarious joke.
60,31,I am not a doctor and I have been a doctor.
60,43,So you think everyone else who has a job as a doctor is a joke? I'm not sure what I would do without one.
60,49,"The jokes are about the government, not the government. It's about preventing the spread of a virus."
60,50,">I'm sorry, but I am not a doctor."
60,52,I was going to say this in one of the AMAs and I felt bad for the guy. I can't even believe it's a joke.
60,56,"Is the ""Journal"" joke about the government? I don't see how a sarcastic joke can actually make people laugh, unless the joke is about the government."
68,60,It is a joke. You are a patriot.
69,60,"I can't think of any way to get a joke like this, but the reason people are scared of the government is because they are in an effort to stop the spread of a virus."
75,60,People don't want to get sick because of pandemics. A vaccine is not needed in the US. But it has to do with pandemics.
78,60,It's funny. I feel like I am being kind of harsh. I feel like I am being kind of harsh. I feel like I am being kind of harsh.
83,60,Vaccines are illegal. And they aren't legal. And they aren't required unless you are a doctor. Vaccines are not legally required unless you are a doctor.

60,18,Vaccines are not required in the U.S. It's illegal because people with the right mask will get sick. It's a joke.
60,31,"I would never wear a mask to stop this, but a bit of a shithole here. The government is not a joke, it's a joke. It's about the people who are immune. Vaccines are not required in the US. But they aren't legally required unless you are a doctor."
60,43,"A joke about the government, and a joke about a politician who is referring to himself as a doctor. Clearly, it is a joke."
60,49,"AMAs can be funny for a reason. There's literally literally a ""joke"" and a ""joke"" in the AMA, and a ""joke"" is a word that says ""the joke"" in the AMA. I don't see any way to get a joke about the government. But the jokes are about the government, not the government. It's about preventing the spread of a virus."
60,50,"The word joke is a joke. People say it's funny, but it's not."
60,52,You're actually a joke. You're a jerk.
60,56,You are being a little harsh.
68,60,I think it's pretty obvious the government is trying to be a joke because the AMAs are very interesting and humorous.

78,60,I don't like the 'I think it's funny' and I'm a little frustrated.

60,17,"I am not a doctor, but I don't have to wear a mask, I have to wear the mask myself. I have to wear the mask at all times, especially after work. It is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus."

60,52,What a joke. I don't know anything about the AMA but it makes me want to be a doctor. I'm an atheist and I'm aware of the jokes and that the government doesn't want people to worry about what's going on in the world. I don't like the AMA.
60,56,I would have never been a doctor if i wasn't in the hospital because of the jokes and it doesn't have a real purpose.
68,60,I think this AMA is about a man being referred to as 'jimmies' (short for people who think it's a joke).
69,60,I have to say I am indignant and I don't know why this has gotten so much attention. It's pretty interesting how people take that kind of stupid nonsense that doesn't make sense. I have heard that most people that get vaccinated don't get it.

60,17,Is the AMA about preventing the spread of a virus?
60,18,Vaccines are not mandatory. They are not a good idea to stop it because the people who wear a mask will get sick. This is a joke.

60,52,"""He's a member of the CDC and a hivemind. The fact he is wearing a mask means he's been doing this for years. He's probably a jerk."""
60,56,There is a joke of the type that is a dick in the face. The problem is a joke about the aforementioned blunder.
68,60,I do not think people realize that they're in the US. They were actually able to make a point of the AMA.
69,60,"I read an article recently about people infected with viruses, and it was a joke."
75,60,What would make this a joke if it was only one of the four lines of AMAs?
78,60,The AMA was a joke. And I'm sure the person who wrote it was very familiar with it.
83,60,"And I've read it: ""I do not believe in the masked system in my country, but I don't believe in the masked system in the US."""
60,2,AMAs are fun. It's a funny thing for a'she' to wear a mask if she gets a fever or something that doesn't bother her. It's a funny thing for a'she' to wear a mask if she's got any other illness.'
60,8,AMAs have a few different categories.
60,12,">If you aren't a jerk, you shouldn't be laughing at the AMA."
60,17,And the people that didn't go through the AMA. They have to wear a mask. If they think a person is snobbish they can do something to help.

60,56,This is a joke. There's a reason why a med student should not wear a mask.
68,60,"Why do you think that the government is trying to be a joke? The joke is that it makes it less funny, which is the point of the AMA, not that it's a joke."
69,60,What is the definition of a joke?
75,60,"AMA [Songs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osseus_Vs_Viem_Blood, p. 170.293) is a joke."
78,60,I read a lot of AMAs and I never read a single one. My first one came from an article by someone who grew up with a man who had an AIDS diagnosis. It is not like the article is a rip off of the book.

60,2,"I'd like to say that there is a certain humour in a lot of AMAs, not that they're fun to watch, but that the humor is also a part of the joke."

60,49,"The problem isn't getting a jar of words to say to a person, but the person's response."
60,50,...and then I thought it was a joke
60,52,It's not a joke. I'm an atheist and I'm aware of the jokes. I'm not a fan of AMAs. It sounds like the AMA is really a joke.

60,18,AMAs are a popular way to start a conversation. They're pretty funny and they don't require a medical opinion. The general etiquette of an AMA is that they're not about the government doing anything to prevent a disease. It's a kind of joke that people use in a joke to push the issue to the point where it's not actually a joke.

75,60,"They are trying to gain the publics attention, even though they are trying to make the public feel more comfortable with it."
78,60,"I'm really sorry that this is going to get downvoted - but it does sound like it's been used extensively in media about this sort of thing, so I'm gonna put in a little to show some context."

60,43,This is why I do not make AMAs in public unless they have serious ethical implications.
60,49,"As someone who had been asked to do an AMA with a virus, I can confirm that AMAs are a joke."
60,50,"What I was reading, while reading the other comments, was that the CDC is actually trying to prevent the spread of a virus, and it is in fact a joke, not a joke.

I do feel that this kind of behavior should be banned and they should be given more freedom of speech and a way to prevent it.

60,49,"""Well it's the government that is trying to make the government a joke, and I think it's a good joke if you're going to stop it."""
60,50,"I think it is pretty silly to say what people say when they are asked in an AMA about the government, so you can't see how it's funny."
60,52,"I think the AMA in question is not a joke about the government, but about the government's role in the pandemic. There are some jokes about the government in a non-obvious way, but it’s not a joke about the government."
60,56,It's really not a joke. I don't think a lot of people are asking for it because of the way they are trying to make the joke.
68,60,"I don't think people are going to even get it that way. I'm going to say I think it's a joke, but I can't stand how the other posters would be offended by it because the joke isn't a joke. It's just a joke."
69,60,"If you're going to go to a party, you should wear a mask and not say something like that. Its not a joke. Its just a ripoff."
75,60,"> I think a lot of people would have to read the AMA because I think that it's a joke, not a joke. I'm not sure how many people would have to if I didn't know how to say it's a joke."
78,60,"The point of an AMA is to point out that some people think this is a joke. This is a joke to point out that the author of the book is not a doctor, and the reason why this is a joke is because the author thinks that the actual issue would be worse if everyone in that audience were the ones in the interview. That is a problem if people don't take that into consideration."
83,60,Vaccines are not legally required because they have the potential to cause fatalities. Vaccines are not legally required unless you are a doctor. Vaccines are not legally required unless you are a doctor. They aren't legally required because they have the potential to cause fatalities.
60,2,I don't think that is a joke. I think the whole point of an AMA is that they tend to not make a lot of jokes about the government.
60,8,"The article is a spoof of the joke, but he's trying to make a joke that doesn't involve the actual situation. He's saying that he doesn't want to be vaccinated, so he needs to wear a mask. So, what did he do with it? Was he vaccinated? Was he a twit? Was he a medic? Was he a doctor? Was he a doctor? Was he a twit?"
60,12,I think it would be a good idea to wear a mask and bend over.
60,17,AMAs are basically a series of jokes that make no sense to us and aren't really funny at all.
60,18,"The whole joke is hilarious. You read the title? I don't know, but I think it's pretty funny. Because of the fact that the government is trying to prevent the spread of the virus."
60,31,"I read a lot about the government, and it was a joke that it was made in the book that came out and the AMA was that it was not an actual AMA. There are plenty of people who think this is a joke. The movie is based on a book."
60,43,"I've read multiple AMAs. Mostly about 'the government' and what its role is, and the idea of being a doctor is pretty absurd."
60,49,"This article is being used as a template for the ""Cave A Trash"" type joke AMA. There's literally a bunch of ad hominem jokes, tbh. ""Wearing a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend over Please wear a mask and bend over please'"" (and ad hominem joke)."
60,50,"""The AMA is about preventative action promoting prevention and preventing the spread of a virus."
60,52,AMA. (http://www.abcc.gov/publications/faqs/FFAQs/FFAQs/FFAQs/fFAQs_events_daily-sensations/)
60,56,The author has made a great point. This is what we should expect from the AMAs.
68,60,This is a crappy AMA. It is about the government.
69,60,Vaccines are legal because of the health of a person.
75,60,I think '[NAME] is a very good person.'
78,60,I’m not sure if I’m making this joke or it’s just me being jaded because there’s an AMA and you’re being jaded because it’s so common.
83,60,"That's what we call the word ""Jerk"""
60,2,AMAs are about the government. AMAs are not about the government.
60,8,The AMA is about the government and their mission.
60,12,Is the government a joke? I think they should be banned.
60,17,This is what the article is about.
60,18,"So, ""It's hilarious that you read the title, but I think it's funny."""
60,31,That's a good thing because it's an AMA and you're being jaded.
60,43,"I think it's the ""Mom is just a joke,"" and we can all relate to the title as this."
60,49,'A lot of things can make me feel pretty awful because of it. I'm a little uneasy.''
60,50,"What the ""Jerk"" is about is not the actual joke but that the government is trying to stop a virus spread, because it's the government's job to prevent it, but the AMA is based on the AMA, not the movie."
60,52,"The author of the book says that the AMA should be about preventing the spread of a virus, so it is to promote awareness and preventing the spread of the virus if people want to make jokes about it."
60,56,"If it's a joke, it's going to get more complicated."
68,60,The government and the public is a joke.
69,60,"I read that you are joking. The best joke is that it's a joke, but it doesn't make people laugh."
75,60,">I think a lot of people would have to read the AMA because I think that it's a joke, not a joke."
78,60,"In my opinion, it’s a joke to point out that there are many more things the CDC and CDC are trying to stop."
83,60,"""Jeez, the government is an idiot!"""
60,2,"A lot of people have a habit of doing this because they want to find out more about the virus and what vaccines are. There are not enough vaccines. In fact, a lot of people don't have a problem with the government."
60,8,This is what is the best AMA I've seen in a while.
60,12,I'd like to add the following:
60,17,People who don't like the idea of wearing a mask at parties aren't just as naive as the other people.
60,18,"AMAs are so far gone that it's very hard to think of a ""Jerk"" AMA without being called a joke despite its tense etiquette."
60,31,[Seems like a really good joke.](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit-msns/wab/comments/4_raised_by_me/raised_by_me)
60,43,The title of this is about a person who has never made an AMA.
60,49,"They're all really just a little over the top. They're like saying, ""We should all keep it on the floor,"" but to be honest I wouldn't want to see it as a fucking AMA."
60,50,"It's not about the actual joke, it's about the whole thing. It's about how you're not a doctor and you're not a doctor. But when you do it, the joke can come off as a joke and be interpreted as one of the jokes. It's a joke and not a joke."
60,52,I'm a Christian so I want to get that AMA banned. It is the AMA that AMAs are about preventing the spread of the virus.Vaccines are legal because of the health of a person.
60,56,"I don't think the people who think the AMA is funny are being ""jaded"" by it."
68,60,"The AMA has a point. I think the point is that the government is trying to be a joke. """
69,60,I'm a doctor. The joke was just as funny as it is funny.
75,60,"AMA's are usually just a bunch of ad hominem jokes, tbh."
78,60,The story was very clear and it is about saving lives. Vaccines are for life - I'm a doctor and I don't think that's the point of the article.
83,60,This isn't legal.
60,2,"The word AMA, meaning the AMA is about the government is a joking term. The AMA is about the government. The AMA is a way to describe what is funny about the government. It is not a joke, is it?"
60,8,"I was told by an AMA on Facebook that he was having some sort of run on him, but the AMA didn't mention it, so I made him laugh and just said ""Hey, I'm not going to wear a mask. I need to take it off, and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please"" but did it not"
60,12,"This is a joke, the AMA is a joke. I don't know if people will actually take it seriously but it is a joke. This isn't about the government, it's about the government. It's about trying to stop the spread of a virus. The government does not like the idea of it, but it's the government's job. There isn't enough information out there for people to make a joke about it. A lot of people don't like a joke about it and don't even want to do it."
60,17,I can't believe the number of times I see it in the title - I was an AMA with a doctor who is basically just in the same position as I am. They all seemed pretty jaded.
60,18,I've had an AMA about preventing the spread of an AIDS infection.
60,31,"'Weakness' is a pretty common term for an AMA and the AMA is to tell a story about one person who isn't vaccinated but who's actually on a vaccine if they're on a vaccine if they're on one. You can also read about it if you're not on a vaccine if you don't know it or you are not on it at all. Its about a rip off of a book, and some of the AMA are really in a joke about the government."
60,43,AMA is not a joke and it's a joke because the joke isn't a joke.
60,49,"""Muh, this is an AMA. It's about stopping the spread of the virus."""
60,50,There are lots of jokes about the government. You can't just jokingly say something ridiculous to people.
60,52,"I think there's a lot of things we have to do and how we don't do it. The way we do it, I think it's not funny. The best joke is that it's an actual fact, but doesn't make people laugh."
60,56,"AMAs are a way of telling a story, but the question remains, what's the point of this article?"
68,60,"I'm not saying this is a good joke. This is a good example of why people hate it. You're a patriot, but don't have any respect for the government."
69,60,The best joke is that the government hasn't done anything about this.
75,60,"It's not a joke, but the government is helping fight pandemics. That is a joke, and it's about the government."
78,60,Why is a person wearing a mask about the disease? Is it because they have no way of knowing if they want to go to a doctor? Do you know why they would bother putting a mask on because of the AIDS?
83,60,"This is a joke. If you are a doctor, you will get sick. A vaccination is a ripoff, as the CDC says. It is a joke, but it isn't legal. It's illegal for people to get sick, as a ripoff, because the health department will be there, and the government will make sure that they get the proper vaccinations for their needs. Vaccines aren't legal because they aren't legal to cause fatalities."
60,2,I read a good book about this.
60,8,"No, they're just trying to get the word out."
60,12,"That's really not what I am going to do with your post OP. I am a patient and I can tell you this, but you are not getting a better perspective here than I am. I know that they are trying to promote prevention, but they're also trying to get people to actually get infected by a virus, because it's a problem that is very common, and I do not want to see more of them."
60,17,What's wrong with a mask?
60,18,"There is a lot of funny things about the government, like it's part of a joke, as in that it's not a joke. That's pretty much the AMA (aka AMA for ad hominems), it's about the government and the government is able to provide a cure to a disease."
60,31,I just want to point out that it isn't true and I don't see how the article can be considered a joke without being a complete joke.
60,43,"In general, as a person who has seen viruses on my hand, I don't think the virus can be vaccinated because it's a ""tinker"" in my body. It's just an obvious way to protect myself."
60,49,It was written by an old man whose job is to give him a smack in the face that he hasn't been told by the government.
60,50,"""This is a good example of why people hate this. You're a patriot, but don't have any respect for the government. It's not a good example of why people hate this. I'm not a patriot, but don't have any respect for the government. The best joke is that it's funny, but it doesn't make people laugh. It's a good example of why people hate this. I'm not saying this is a good joke. I'm going to wear a mask and bend over please, and bend over"
60,52,""" I have a friend who wears a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please please wear a mask and bend over please do not have an excuse."", """
60,56,They're trying to do the AMA to keep people in the loop on a topic they're not on.
68,60,The whole point is that the government is trying to be a joke because people aren't willing to understand it.
69,60,There's a lot of controversy about how people are being exploited.
75,60,"AMAs are very short. Some people like to say ""I don't understand how people want to be offended by a joke. I think it's funny that people think it's a joke, but it's a joke."""
78,60,I don't think it's a joke. I think it's a joke.
83,60,You just put it on a pc. You don't need a mask to protect yourself. If you need a mask you should get a health check and see if you need one.
60,2,AMAs are the best way to understand what this whole thing is about the government. They are a form of a discussion. It's a thing to have fun.
60,8,"That's one of those things. A mask is a mask, not a vaccine. It isn't legal. The CDC would not be able to provide a cure to a virus. They would also be able to protect the public against the virus."
60,12,I'm not joking. I'm just saying:
60,17,"I’m a little tired of these kinds of jokes. One that is actually ridiculous, is a joke for those who don’t even understand them. They are made to make a joke about government."
60,18,What's the best thing that can happen?
60,31,"Y'know what they said. """

60,56,"I feel like you've been too petty for the last two or three months. I've gotten in the flu myself and have tried to prevent it, and my dick and chin are so painful. I've got a great head. I just can't handle that kind of stuff. The only thing I can do about it is try."
68,60,OP: I think it is a joke because people don’t get it.
69,60,The point is that the article in question was a joke. It was based on the book.
75,60,"I can't be a racist because I can't make the joke that my wife is a pandemic victim, and even if I think I'm a sexist and sexist woman I can't be the anti-government type. But I can think of a lot of reasons why i wouldn't want to be offended at the government if it wasn't a joke. That's kind of a fucking joke."
78,60,"Vaccines are for life, but it's a joke. The guy in the book is basically calling it ""Muscles,"" and there's an interesting thing going on there."
83,60,Vaccines are legal because they have the potential to cause fatalities. Vaccines are not legally required unless you are a doctor. Vaccines are not legal because they have the potential to cause fatalities.
60,2,"A lot of the AMAs have been about the government, the government, the government / government."
60,8,"I would be interested in hearing the doctor who had a vaccinated friend that got a virus and asked him about it. I would tell him he wanted to wear a mask and would like to put on a mask and tell him to go and have a go at it, and then ask him why he didn't go. He would ask him about it."
60,12,I do not have the skill to even begin to read it.
60,17,"[NAME] was the author of the book, and it's pretty cool."
60,18,"People can be infected with the virus with their mask, but that doesn't mean they aren't going to stop them."
60,31,It seems like a very popular idea to me.
60,43,"The word is 'devil nut' and the word is'mash'. It's used to refer to any person who is in a position to be a doctor and if they are in a position to be a doctor, they should be able to say something that is funny and isn't inappropriate. That's a joke. AMAs are jokes. AMAs aren't a joke, it's an insult. The AMAs are a joke to people who don't get the AMA."
60,49,It is a joke because people get sick of that kind of stuff.
60,50,You're joking. You're not a doctor.
60,52,"AMA's are the best way to understand what this whole thing is about the government. They are a form of a conversation. They tend to be about preventing the spread of a virus, but it isn't about the government. It's about helping the public and spreading the virus. Vaccines are legal because they have the potential to cause fatalities."
60,56,>We wear a mask to protect ourselves. I've seen people doing that. I hate it and don't want to be around other people and people in the US who think it's funny.
68,60,a AMA about a 'jerk' is a joke and a joke.
69,60,"Vaccine Advocacy is a joke, and the people who think it's a joke aren't. It's not about the vaccine, it's about the vaccination itself."

78,60,"I think the fact that ""Man in the Hat"" is the one that makes me cringe is indicative of how ridiculous and funny AMAs are. The fact that someone makes a joke about something that they think's funny in the book, and the fact that you think they're being really jaded about it is actually quite a joke."
83,60,"You can't do what you want unless you're a doctor. A doctor isn't required by law to prescribe a vaccine, and you can't do what you want. The same is true of the medical industry."
60,2,"AMAs are not about the government. They are about the government. You can't do what you want, but it can do what you want, it's a joke."
60,8,That's the point. It's a joke that people who get the vaccine get the word out. It's a joke about the government. That's a joke about the government and their mission. That's not a joke.
60,12,I believe the person who wrote the article was referring to [[everything](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oseus-Ves-Virginia-Stp))
60,17,“If a person has to wear a mask and bend over over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please”

It's also a way of making a joke about the government. It's about how the government should be able to ward off the spread of viruses.
60,43,"I think the whole AMA thing is a joke. It's a joke about a joke about an AMA that's about a joke and about a joke about the fact that the guy who wrote it is infected with the virus, but that's just an obvious way to protect yourself."
60,49,"I am a doctor. I had the same problems with getting sick from all of this. In a way, AMAs are actually about preventing the spread of a virus."
60,50,"We are talking about a little thing called ""Hurrrrrrrrrrrr"" that's been going on for a while. A joke about the horrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr"
60,52,The article is being used as a joke and I don't know the full premise. The AMA is a joke and you're not a doctor.
60,56,"I'm not sure how this is a joke, but you may have something in mind in terms of how you make this comment."
68,60,It's not a joke.
69,60,"Vaccine Advocacy is a joke, and its in the CDC's best interest."
75,60,"AMAs are about the government, not the people."
78,60,"I read an AMA on an AMA about the fact that the doctor was talking about the AIDS epidemic, and asked about a joke that would never happen if it were for the AIDS. Isn't that funny?"
83,60,What's the CDC saying about AIDS vaccines?
60,2,I know it's a joke. I would just not tell people who haven't had it.
60,8,"A mask is a way of keeping the word out. The fact that you're being used as a joke, is clearly indicative of how ridiculous and funny AMAs are."
60,12,"The AMAs are based on the author's comments in the title, which is interesting if you take a look at the full title, and aren't sure how they get their message across."
60,17,I think you've read what the AMA is about.
60,18,A lot of people don't understand the joke. That's the problem.
60,31,"I'm in the same position as the other person. I have never had a Vaccine Awareness day in my life. I've been told that when we're going to start getting vaccinated we'll wear a mask, and I'm just as afraid of the virus as we are when we get off to work. When I do get vaccinated, I'll go out and wear a mask and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend"
60,43,"I'm a doctor, and I'm really not that good with the jokes, I just think they're sexist."
60,49,"It's not about the government, it's about the virus. You're just not getting it."
60,50,"It's a joke. AMA's are a joke. The AMA is about the government's mission, not about the CDC. AMA's are about the government's job."
60,52,What I see as being a joke is that there is a government. If I was a doctor I would do the AMA. But the joke is also funny because I don't like the joke.
60,56,"This is a really good one and it's really great, especially because the people that say it isn't funny are pointing out how drecky it is. And if you feel like you need to do something about it and not just go back to your normal self-care lifestyle. If I ever feel like it's too bad, I'm gonna leave."
68,60,"I’m not saying the joke is a joke, I’m just saying it’s a joke and a good example of why people don’t understand it."
69,60,"I have never heard someone say ""I'm not going to get the vaccine in the US. I've seen a virus on my hand. I don't think a virus can be vaccinated because it's a tinker"" in my body. It's just an ""obvious"" thing to do."
75,60,AMAs are about the government. People want to get treated with a mask but can't afford it. There's no joke in that title.
78,60,What's the point of the AMA? Does the AMA show an actual doctor who was in a coma? I'm curious.
83,60,So you're saying people should go to the hospital and get a job because the CDC is not legally required to prescribe them? Because that's not what a joke is. Vaccines are not legally required. And they aren't legally required unless you are a doctor.
60,2,"A sex abuse joke is actually a joke if there is a specific type of joke that should be addressed in an AMA. AMAs are about the government, AMAs are about the government. AMAs are about government, AMAs are about government. AMAs are about government."
60,8,I would wear a mask and bend over and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please wear a mask and bend over please please use a mask and bend over
60,12,"So, when you tell the joke and AMA people don't feel the same way about it and are just going to lie about it?"
60,17,The AMAs are about the government. They're about the government and the AMAs. They are a joke.
60,18,"So, [what's your favorite AMA? The AMA I've read, but it’s been a little long](http://www.youriama.com/resources/advice-and-vaccination-advice-and-vaccine-is-a-joke.pdf)."
60,31,"AMAs are often about health issues that can't be resolved without a mask. The doctor can't say ""I'm not going to get the vaccine, but I'm on the vaccine"". If you get a mask, you should be able to use that to stop the spread of viruses."
60,43,AMAs are about the government and CDC's role in stopping the spread of a virus.
60,49,"The article is also being used as a template for the ""Cave A Trash"" type joke AMA."
60,50,"A doctor said ""I'm sorry, but I don't believe this is a joke."" I was joking. He said he didn't believe the joke that was made."
60,52,"In general, as a person who has seen viruses on my hand, I don't think it's a joke. AMAs are about the government, not the people. AMA's are about preventing the spread of a virus, but about the government's role in the pandemic. Vaccines are legal because they have the potential to cause fatalities. AMA's are about the government. AMA's are about the government, not about the people."
60,56,"You don't really need to read it because you can't read it because it's like ""Well, I think you need to make a mental note: You are essentially saying that the person who was trying to prevent the spread of the virus is the one who did it. And this isn't really a joke."""
68,60,"It was an example of what's going on here. ""I'm so confused - how many people are going to actually understand this. I'm so confused - how many people are going to actually understand how the joke is being made? "", ""I think it's pretty obvious the government is trying to be a joke"""
69,60,I believe that the humor is coming from the people who have been in a fight with AIDS to be vaccinated. This is one of the most popular jokes in the country.
75,60,I think it's a joke. But it's not a joke. The government is not the one who makes fun of the joke.
78,60,"There's no reason I think there's not anything there about it, but there's nothing. There is no time to read the book."
83,60,So what do you do when you get sick?
60,2,"There is a lot of overlap between the AMA, the joke, and the AMA. Isn't the entire idea of a joke about the AMA. I think it is a lot of overlap between the two."
60,8,The AMA is about preventing the spread of a virus. It's not a joke. It's a joke that people who are not immune have more power over the government. It is a joke that people who are immune have more power over the government.
60,12,I can't believe how a cult like that guy actually said that.
60,17,The joke is just an attempt to hide what's going on. You might need to put your mask on and see if you can wear it on someone who is not familiar with the subject.
60,18,AMAs and AMAs are about the government enabling people to wear a mask and bending over a mask and bending over a mask and bending over a mask and bending over a mask and bending over a mask and bending over and bending over and bending over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over and bend over
60,31,I think that you are joking. I'm joking.
60,43,"I read AMAs and learned that the word ""joke"" is only used in the words. AMAs are about the government and CDC's role in stopping the spread of the virus. AMAs are about the government and the government."
60,49,"Yes - ""We are a joke."" And when a doctor says, ""You seem like a joke. Not really a joke. They are all really just over the top. They are like saying, ""We should all keep it on the floor."""
60,50,"none of the jokes's an ""AMA."""
60,52,"The most popular one is ""...I'm so confused - how many people are going to actually understand this."
60,56,"I was referring to this post in general, which I am not familiar with."

69,60,"I'm not a doctor, but I like the way people put things."
75,60,I can relate to some of these comments.
78,60,I'm not a doctor.
83,60,"""I don't believe in the masked system in my country. I think we need more fads. But it's actually pretty easy to give them an incentive to be more protective than the government."
60,2,AMAs are about the government. They are about the government.
60,8,"In America, there isn't a joke to be made. It's that you are not comfortable with wearing a mask."
60,12,I'm also a doc and have a mask that's sexy enough to cover my head with a blanket and get my hands on my own clothes. It's a great way to keep your feet warm and make you feel more comfortable. The one in the photo is sexy enough to keep you on your feet and a neck and a hand as long as you have good airflow and a decent amount of breathing space.
60,17,I'd say it's funny because you can't get into the field of medicine without a mask. But it's a joke.
60,18,"AMAs are a great way to get people to talk about the issue, or even to talk about what AMAs really are. But in general they're kind of shady. AMAs are good. However, I personally don't see why people want to see them as a joke or a joke, and it's not really a joke. I think a AMA is a joke. But it's a joke. The joke is a joke, and it's not a joke. They're just being honest with themselves. And "
60,31,The AMA is based on the book and is not a satire. It's based on the book and is about how the government is going to help stop the spread of a virus.
60,43,"AMAs are an attempt to hide the joke – the ""people who are in a position to be a doctor and if they are in a position to be a doctor, they should be able to say something that is funny and not inappropriate. That's a joke."""
60,49,"I'm a doctor, and I would think that a very funny AMA would be about preventing the spread of a virus."
60,50,The AMA is about the government's mission and what it's about. They are trying to prevent the spread of the virus.
60,52,""". "", """"[[(https://www.abcc.gov/publications/faqs/FFAQs/FFAQs/FFAQs/FFAQs/fFAQs/fFAQs/][[[[[[[[[]]]]]]([[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[]]]]]]([[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[["
60,56,I agree with the others. The government is one of the few things that can cause me to think that it's not funny. I think a bunch of people who have been in a fight with AIDS should look to the doctor to see if they are able to get tested.
68,60,"""The government and the public is a joke."
69,60,"It's not funny, it's a joke."
75,60,"""Why is this joke about the government?"
78,60,I think the joke is an AMA.
83,60,Because the government is a fool who wants to be more protective.
60,2,"I'm going to assume that most people here know what the word ""joke"" means.'', ""I don't know what the definition of a joke is.'', ""I don't think they are being sarcastic about how they do things when they get sick. I've only seen one person do this on my family and I'm sure if they do something like this I'll be in the future"", ""I am not a jerk. I'm not an idiot."
60,8,"No. We're talking about the general premise of what is going on here, but we also want to think about what's happening in the world. I like that the article seems to focus on how a person with a cocky cocky face might rape others. Besides, it's just the opposite of how the government tries to spread a virus."
60,12,The joke should be banned. Its kind of a joke and not about the government. Its about trying to prevent the spread of a virus and how it makes people feel.
60,17,"The article describes how people get on AMAs with the government. The AMAs, I believe, are about the government and the AMAs. They are about government, AMAs, and the government's ad hominem. The joke is not a joke, but a joke. The AMAs are based on the book - a book."
60,18,"The point is, it's a joke and it's a joke. The point is, people are making fun of this person, not the AMA."
60,31,"This is a nice little reference to AMAs, and I think it's one of the nicer ones I've seen, and you're right that it's a joke, but it sounds like you have a point. Isn't that a joke?"
60,43,That's a very good point and it's also about the AMAs being done by the government.
60,49,"It sounds like a joke, not a joke. If you feel uncomfortable, you'll feel better, but a little harsh."
60,50,"People smear the government for it, and pretend to be the shady ones. They take the AMA as a show of what's shady."
60,52,"I'm going to assume that most people here know what the word ""joke"" means. I think it's really a joke. It's a joke, but it's not a joke."
60,56,"""I think it's funny because it is a joke, but the people wearing it are telling the joke in a way that's not really a joke."""
68,60,I'd be offended if people thought it was funny but they were trying to fuck a joke out of it.
69,60,"Vaccine Advocacy is one of the most popular jokes in the country. It's based on the book. The first part is basically a joke about how people can't get the vaccine because they are sick and do no medical work. I've heard that it's a joke that's not about a vaccine, but it's about the vaccine, if they don't have the tools to prevent it from spreading."
75,60,"That's not how you'd describe AMAs. They're about protecting the public, but the government isn't. And AMAs are very short."
78,60,"...and the movie was made by a very famous person who had an AIDS diagnosis....and I'm not a doctor, but I'm actually a doctor."
83,60,They aren't legally required unless you are a doctor. They aren't legally required unless you are a doctor.
60,2,"In the US a AMA AMA is a AMA on the government, in which the government says things about the person that is a doctor that he thinks is a doctor. In fact, a AMA is a AMA."
60,8,He could be getting a med in. A doctor who has been vaccinated is a troll.
60,12,There is no AMA. There is no AMA. This is a joke. I don't think it's a joke.
60,17,What is the point of this comic?
60,18,"So, ""They are not mandatory. They are not a good idea to stop it because people with the right mask will get sick."""
60,31,AMAs are based on the books.
60,43,"Because, while you may not be a doctor, you don't need a mask. If you are, it's your duty to wear it, and if it's the right thing to do, you should wear it. It's not going to stop it."
60,49,"""We have been tasked with a mission to stop the spread of a virus."""
60,50,I'm so sorry AMAs and AMA's aren't related.
60,52,I don't think it's a joke. You're not a doctor and it's a joke. AMAs are jokes that aren't about the government and the government.
60,56,I have to say that this is the most hilarious and most hilarious I've ever seen.
68,60,"It's about what the government is trying to accomplish, and not about what it's trying to accomplish, but not about how it's going to happen."
69,60,"It's not a joke. It's a joke. A joke, but it's a joke."
75,60,"[no relation to the AMA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osseus_Vs_Viem_Blood, p. 170.293) is a joke."
78,60,Vaccines are for life.
83,60,Vaccines are not legal because they have the potential to cause fatalities. Vaccines are not legally required because they have the potential to cause fatalities.
60,2,AMA ad: The CDC is a conspiracy theorist who tries to spread the truth while simultaneously accusing the government of infiltrating the national security system. It is one of the most popular jokes in the country.
60,8,"AMAs are written to help people better understand and understand what's going on in the world. The word ""joke"" is a way of making the joke."
60,12,This subreddit is a joke. It is about trying to stop the spread of a virus and how it makes people feel. The joke isn't a joke. It is a joke.
60,17,I'm actually pretty excited to finally see the video! Thanks for the AMA.
60,18,It's not a joke. This is about how the government is trying to prevent the spread of the virus. Vaccines are not legally required because people with the right mask will get sick. This is about the government trying to prevent the spread of a virus.
60,31,It's not a joke.
60,43,That's a joke.
60,49,It's not a joke.
60,50,I think the whole purpose of the AMA is to evoke a kind of empathy for people who would otherwise not be able to ascribe that sort of emotional resentment to someone who knows they are being a little crazy.
60,52,"'The AMA' is about the government and the people's role in the pandemic. 'It's a joke, but it's a joke, but it's not a joke.'"
60,56,"I suck my dick but it doesn't hurt. I have a dick too! And my friends want me to eat a dick and get it. So the best advice I can give to the people who would do it would be to get it off of the face and cut them off. I'd even suggest going to the ER or anything to get tested for the flu and see if it's a dick, or maybe a dick. If you can't have it off of the dick or just the face in the"
68,60,I would never be offended by a joke about it. I am very confused.
69,60,"A great joke is a joke, because it's a joke."
75,60,"No jokes about the government. But the government isn't getting the public the health care they need, so it's a joke."
78,60,I think this is a joke to make sure the doctor isn't referring to you as a doctor.
83,60,"""Vaccines are not legally required because they have the potential to cause fatalities."
60,2,"I am a teen, and I'm trying to understand what you are talking about. AMAs are generally funny and make people feel better about themselves. They're all about the government."
60,8,"CANNOTANSWER: I'm a kid who wears a mask at parties.

60,18,"The article states that ""In the US, the people who wear the mask must be infected with the virus, but don't get to choose which one is better for them"". And that there are also a lot of things you're saying in the AMA, such as: ""We all can't see why people would want to see it as a joke, but we can think about it as a joke."""
60,31,"That is why you can't even get a dick if you're on it, if the doctor doesn't tell you what to do, it's too much trouble a good dick is going to hurt you if you don't have the vaccine. It's more a way of getting the word out of your mouth and that's why he's going to try to put a mask on you instead of telling you what to do because you don't know anything about your life or the government. If you're on a dick"
60,43,That's a joke. I'm a doctor and I'm not a joke.
60,49,"Yes, I love that one. Totally different than the other."
60,50,I think I may have read this because my mind is a little tainted by it. It doesn't look like a joke at all to me. I just know I am a doctor.
60,52,"I don't know. You could say that, but you were a joke about the AMA, but you are an atheist."
60,56,You think it is a joke?
68,60,"My favorite part is I can think of a mask to protect me'', 'The only thing I can think of that I do for myself is a mask, and my nose. I think that's very important to the cause of the virus. ''I'm a patriot. ''The government is trying to help protect children.''''"
