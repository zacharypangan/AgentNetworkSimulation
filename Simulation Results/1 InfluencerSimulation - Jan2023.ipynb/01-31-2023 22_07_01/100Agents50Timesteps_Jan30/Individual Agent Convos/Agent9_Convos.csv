9,5,My brother was in the orlando area. I was shocked to find out he did not have to wear a mask.
9,8,"I have a great friend who runs for the CDC and he uses his mask and his friend threw up. I don t care if people are going to use it to help protect themselves or his family, but he needs a mask to protect himself and me, not to cover his face with a mask. I'm a little scared but I have been bitten by covid and it looks like there are other cases. I do not know where it came from, but that would be good. I would always recommend a face mask, a face mask and maybe a"

89,9,I'd like to wear a mask with me.

18,9,This is a great idea.
20,9,My wife does not vaccinate. I have no idea if she has an infection that I will get to see her doctor again. It's like this with a black cat.
34,9,"OP, there is a cdc / NHA guideline for that... i.e., a mandate for a new national public hospital, an outbreak of a virus and a national mandate for a new national government to prevent a virus from spreading."
38,9,I think you should wear a mask.
41,9,I believe that people should be in the wrong to wear a mask in order to keep the virus away from other people and to stop anyone from being in danger.
44,9,"Thanks for the support. I'm sorry to hear about your vaccinating. Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of a virus, it's useless and I hate it. He is wearing a mask."
53,9,I thought he had the virus.
67,9,"I think you know the problem, you should wear a mask. Having a helmet is very important, but having a mask on will actually prevent the spread of a virus."
68,9,"> ""wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of a virus. I'm wearing a mask outside while vaccinated because people like you are in my face why does it bother you to the point that you are asking random people why they are doing something that makes them feel safe please leep your mask on"
89,9,I hate wearing a mask. I don't even know what to do with it.
9,1,So you are saying you're not interested in knowing about the vaccination? What's the issue with this?
9,4,"I’m wearing a mask right now and just want to let you know I don’t see what your comment means, but my brother has it and he can do it if he pleases."
9,5,"Well, my wife doesn't vaccinate. I don't vaccinate. She has to get out of it. I see that a good part of being safe is that we have to be vaccinated every day or something. That's ok, but I can't say how much safer I'm being to her. I mean, if she is vaccinated for a virus, I wouldn't care, but I'll just be wearing a mask outside."
9,8,I know a lot of people that wear masks. I know a lot of people that do not vaccinate. They're the same kind of person whose only job is to keep them safe.
11,9,There are actually a couple things that I believe are a good reason not to wear masks.
18,9,Vaccines are also used to prevent people from getting sick from the virus.
20,9,"> I'm a woman who needs to wear a mask. In addition to blaming the hr for the masks, the hr has been suing the staff."
34,9,This is just a slap on the wrist for doing nothing. I think the question here is: do people like it?
38,9,I was a federal agent for years. This was only a couple of years back and I was still in a mask.
41,9,I would tell you to get an emergency call and stop. I would not do anything you mentioned.
44,9,"A good thing people can have masks. If you're trying to prevent spreading of a virus, you have to wear a mask to prevent you from getting one. Obviously the only way to stop it is to have a vaccinating campaign."
53,9,>It seems the idea of a mask is just too'religious' to get in a fight. I think it is just a way to stop a virus from spreading. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
67,9,"I have a bit of a hard time believing that if you are going to wear a mask you will be able to prevent the spread of a virus. I'm not going to say it won't do much, but it will give you a chance to find the most effective way to stop the spread. Unless you want to be in an extreme environment where this type of virus can't happen, you're not going to be able to prevent it."
68,9,Is this a common joke?
89,9,That's an interesting title.
9,1,"I don't know if you know what the joke is. I was a federal agent for a couple of years. This was only a couple of years back and I was still in a mask. I know a lot of people that wear masks. In addition to blaming the hr for the masks, the hr has been suing the staff. This is just a slap on the wrist for doing nothing."

9,8,I think it’s interesting how a doctor could get a little cig contaminated with the flu virus. Vaccines can be very effective.

44,9,The only way to stop this is to have a vaccinating campaign.
53,9,"I think it's a good idea to start with a mask that's supposed to look like a band aid and let you have a go. I do see people wearing a mask, but I think there's something wrong with that."

9,8,Is the CDC suing the CDC for not doing anything?
11,9,I'm not a lawyer. It's just how it is.
18,9,"I know that if you take out a mask you wear a mask to protect yourself, but I don't think that's what he meant."
20,9,"The CDC emailed me a new copy of the CDC website. It has a lot of information. It has a lot of information about health care in the US, including a copy of the CDC website, and the list of the health care providers they serve."
34,9,Is this a reference to a book?
38,9,"It's not about you wearing a mask, it's about not wearing a mask. You're going to have to have a conversation with someone about it, so do it for an hour or two to get them to respond."
41,9,I'm not sure what the OP was talking about. I was just trying to be empathetic to someone else. What he's saying is that it makes you uncomfortable.
44,9,It's a prank and it's not a joke.
53,9,I don't think any medical or pharmaceutical companies are going to use it in the first place unless the person is being charged with an infectious disease.
67,9,"People are very immature and utterly delusional and if you cant think of anything worse than having your head over your head and then seeing a man in your face with a virus on you, I don't see what they mean."
68,9,I think that's one of the best jokes of all time.
89,9,The NSA is very accepting of mask culture.
9,1,">I'm wearing a mask right now and just want to let you know I don't see what your comment means, but my brother has it and he can do it if he pleases."

9,8,I know how a doctor might get a little contaminated. But the truth is that he's wearing it to protect himself and you so I think the government is suing them.
11,9,"I think if you want to protect yourself you can use a helmet in tight environments. You're not a law, so I'm gonna say it's a good idea."
18,9,"I read this as a bit of a racial commentary on a joke about an ""I wear a mask because I don't want to get sick and that it's very harmful for my health."
20,9,"It's not illegal to wear a mask while at work, it's a prank. It's a prank, and it is the only way to keep you safe."

44,9,"""...the only way to stop this is to have a vaccinating campaign."""
53,9,A person who thinks they have the virus has no right to wear a mask to protect himself. A person that thinks they have a right to wear a mask is a person who thinks he is a troll and is making a joke in order to get away with it.
67,9,"You might have an idea of what's going on there, and you might not want to go."
68,9,"I think that this is the point you want to make, but I think you will also need to keep in mind that I do not think that the government is supposed to be helping with these things?"
89,9,I think it's interesting to me that there are a few people in the NSA who are claiming that they CAN work with a mask and they have no problem using one. The fact that the NSA is accepting of the NSA is probably related to the fact that they actually do work with people that are doing it.
9,1,As I recall: I've never been in a mask. The only time I've ever had any issues is when I was working in a factory and I was being vaccinated.
9,4,I have to say I really enjoy the fuck out of this

11,9,You don't really have any reason to wear a mask.
18,9,"I was thinking more of the joke he said if you can't keep your hands off for a minute, you should keep your hands off for a second and it will be for life. I don't think the NSA can be blatantly lying."
20,9,"It's a joke. But I'm afraid it's not in any way related to the vaccine, it's about the government doing their best to prevent the spread."
34,9,"I've been to all the santas and the moon, and every one of them seems to be in some sort of funk. I think the santa joke is incredibly accurate, especially considering the fact that you implying that the face of santa could be a virus is a joke. I think the santa joke is incredibly accurate, especially considering the fact that you implying that the face of santa could be a virus is a joke."
38,9,"I know many people who are going through the same thing... a lot of them say that the problem is getting a prank to help people who are infected, or at least want to give them some protection from a virus."
41,9,"""The only thing that can actually prevent you from getting a virus, so it's the only possible way you can stop it in the future. Vaccines are a very, very basic human right to not be vaccinated."
44,9,I don't think he was referring to the AMA.
53,9,The article discusses the issue of having a mask when you go into a TB hospital. You have to be in the position to get vaccinated.
67,9,"I'm not gonna lie, it's an ironic joke. People who wear a mask do not help the spread of a virus. That is a really bad example of misinformation."
68,9,The government is probably doing things in spite of their mandate.
89,9,IANAL. I’d like to wear a mask with me. I don’t know what to do with it.
9,1,"My favorite santa is when I'm working in a factory and my mother is on medication. She wears a mask and we're in my company and they're very good. The NSA can't be a bit of a dick, but I think the whole ""I genuinely enjoyed seeing the joke that they were trying to help me"" thing popped into my head when I was there."
9,4,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

9,8,"I have a lot of friends who wear a mask to protect themselves, but they only use it for my friends. It’s a joke. I don’t know if that’s a joke, but it’s not a joke, it’s a joke."
11,9,"If you were in the medical profession that you would be wearing a mask that was a prank and I would say a joke about a pedophile is an awful joke. I'd recommend a movie about a pedophile that is prank, albeit only a joke."
18,9,"It's not that a prank, but a joke. It's not a joke, it's a joke. The NSA has no obligation to keep people safe, it's a prank."
20,9,"I've always known the term ""sold out"" is very generic, I can get a little confused sometimes. It's hard to find it with ""advice"" or ""advice"" and in some situations it's also just ""incompetent...."
34,9,I think the idea is ridiculous to imply that all of the masks in the CDC would do more to prevent more people from getting sick?
38,9,Unless you're from a state that has an irrational hatred of racial and religious feminism.
41,9,"Vaccines are NOT a common practice. Vaccines have never been known to stop the spread of a virus. They do not prevent rape. They don't prevent ebola, but they are not required for the vaccines to stop the spread of a virus."
44,9,"Vaccination is not a cure for AIDS. HIV is a disease. It's a disease that exists in the United States, not the global AIDS outbreak."
53,9,I'm not the only one. I just don't understand how people can be so hostile and be able to be outraged that I can't stand the idea of wearing a mask.
67,9,That was a nice little explanation of the problem and a good point.

89,9,"Why would a friend wear a mask? It's not just a joke, it's a joke. That's a very general idea, and a pretty common joke. There is nothing wrong with this but it's the only way you could understand a joke and not want to tell it."

38,9,I've seen this a million times and every time I've heard it I think it's a joke and it doesn't mean anything. It's a joke and I think it's pretty odd to me how many people realize that this is about the government's actions in preventing the spread of a virus.
41,9,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.And that's not how we should have them. I don't even know why they are trying to make it illegal, but it seems to me they do not have a problem."
44,9,"It doesn't seem like there is much sexism there. And yes, it's misleading."
53,9,"A lot of people think people should be in the medical industry. They're not allowed to get vaccinated, they need to do something sexy, sexy. It's not really funny, and that's one of the reasons they say people shouldn't get in a situation when they don't want to, but it's just ridiculous."
67,9,The best way to fix a sick fetus is to take one of the top three worst things a person can do on a birthday.

9,1,It’s really the only way I can remember saying this.
9,4,I would probably do this all the time if I lived in New York.
9,5,I'm not a lawyer. But this is how a joke is made.

38,9,"My uncle told me that if I didn't wear a mask when he was sick and my wife didn't come home, the doctor would find a sex act with me. He said, 'Mama, do you have a face?'."
41,9,Vaccines are not illegal in most places. CDC does not want to make them illegal.
44,9,"As a Canadian, I find this a joke because of how much people tend to hate the AMA. They want to take it for granted. They don't want to be in the AMA or a documentary or anything. The joke isn't just about how the vaccines are getting distributed, it's about how it's effectively being a joke in order to avoid spreading the disease. This is a political joke, because it's the AMA and it's not about the vaccines."
53,9,"I don't think any of them know anything about the word ""jail."" I can understand why some people feel that way, but the joke is about the masks."
67,9,A Vaccine is not a joke? You can't be in an extreme environment with a virus there. You can't be in an extreme environment and you can't be in an extreme environment.
68,9,It’s a joke and a joke. We need a mask. It’s a joke.
89,9,"The whole point of making a joke like that is to make everyone else feel bad, and it's the same with the word ""joke""."
9,1,Vaccines are not required to stop the spread of a virus.
9,4,The main point is to remind you that your afra is a joke. It is not about it. It is about how afra does not care about protecting others from AIDS. It's not about that.
9,5,Vaccines are not illegal in most places. They do not want to make them illegal.
9,8,"I don’t know if it’s a joke, but I really like the AMA. The AMA and the joke are so close. I can understand why some people hate it, but the joke is about the mask. The whole point of making a joke like that is to make everyone else feel bad, and it’s the same with the word joke."

41,9,Vaccines are not illegal in most places. CDC does not want to make them illegal.
44,9,"I mean, it was a prank, but people are still ignoring it, they seem to have found that this is a joke. The AMA is a joke about the federal government."
53,9,"There is a lot of overlap here, like in the movie The Man in the Hat. It's very funny. Yes, I think the AMA is a little confusing, it's basically asking if the CDC is a gimmick. I think that the funny part is that it's kind of a joke."
67,9,"I like to make it a joke because I've done it with everyone I meet on the internet.

34,9,He's a big egotistical slob who's got some good ideas that are not necessarily relevant to the subject. This is an interesting way to look at things and see the facts.
38,9,"Vaccines are for life, not just to help with the disease."
41,9,It was interesting to see the AMA's.
44,9,"I'm a Canadian, I know it's not funny. I think it's just a joke. I mean, there's a difference between the AMA, and the AMA."
53,9,"This is an AMA, not a joke."
67,9,"It's been written by someone that is not involved with public health. It's not very good at that. Is there a good way to prevent a virus? If so, it's better to just avoid it and stick to a good one."
68,9,I don't think the most popular media is popular in other countries.
89,9,"People with phobias can wear a mask as a means of protecting themselves, not a form of protection. The CDC isn't giving the people a choice to wear a mask, but it does tell them that they'll have more fun if they don't wear one."
9,1,"""I'm wearing a mask right now and just want to let you know I don't see what your comment means, but my brother has it and he can do it if he pleases."""
9,4,">It was interesting to see the AMA's. I'm a Canadian, I know it's not funny. I think it's just a joke. I think the fact that it is a joke is pretty obnoxious."
9,5,This is really the most cliche of AMAs
9,8,"...and it's a joke, isn't it? It's a joke."
11,9,The problem is that this is a joke. There are a lot of people who would not consider the whole incident a joke.
18,9,">I don't wear a mask, i wear a mask when I run. i think there's a big difference, but i feel it's a big difference."
20,9,The government is trying to get the CDC to stop the spread of this virus. You have to wear a mask to stop it. This is why we have to have the CDC and the CDC to put on a mask to prevent it. Is this the only solution available in the US?
34,9,I can't stop thinking about it.
38,9,This is not funny. This is ridiculous. I feel like this is a bit tainted by how it was written:
41,9,"If a CDC official does not want to do so, then it is illegal."
44,9,AMA (Miracle Health Awareness Month): A short story of one of my friends who hasn't received the vaccine. She says her doctor said she could not get it without her mask on.
53,9,I am really excited for this one. This post is the right one.
67,9,"The most important nefarious message is “I’m not going to get sick, or if you want to get sick, I can’t wear a mask. If you want to get sick, I’ll come home and clean you, if I’m not, and you need me to make you sick.” I’ll put the mask on and say “Wait...Wait....”"
68,9,"In the AMA: ""It is funny that you can wear a mask and not be a dick"""
89,9,"This isn't an article on that one, but rather a wiki article. The article is about the CDC and the lack of funding, and the fact that there are people in this country who are in the process of removing the NSA's masks. They're just claiming that the NSA's masks are a means of preventing the spread of a virus. They're probably not a rabid conspiracy theorists in their ignorance of the NSA's decision to act on his jokes."
9,1,So they want to prevent the spread of the disease?
9,4,'Cannonballs'or 'Nai'
9,5,"As a Canadian who never smoked any other flu, I found it hard to believe that there was a CDC article where the CDC cited a joke about the flu. I am sorry, but there is no actual proof that it's the vaccine."
9,8,It's not a joke. It's a joke. A joke. A joke.
11,9,"I know the joke isn't funny and it was not what I was hoping for, but I would give a damn if it were. But yeah, it's still a joke."
18,9,I've seen more and more people in the CDC/CDC AMA than in this one:
20,9,"This would be very strange. I'm not sure why people would put on a mask to stop a virus. It sounds like it is just a joke because I like the notion of ""oh no, they don't think you'll get sick again"" which they aren't likely to really understand."
34,9,"Affirmative action is a major part of any healthcare reform. I've been to the santas and the moon, and they seem to be in some sort of funk. I think the joke is incredibly accurate."
38,9,"The problem is that we aren't going to stop the spread of a virus, or the government is going to stop it. The problems aren't the people who are going through it, they're the people who are going through the problem."
41,9,It's a joke because it's not a joke because it's an AMA.
44,9,I would never get sick unless my parents told me that they can't get vaccinated. But they do not want to be in the AMA and they seem to have found that this is a joke. AMA is a joke about the government. The one in the article is a joke.
53,9,As an HIV patient I can confirm that this is true. Vaccines are a disease that makes me sick.
67,9,"Well the CDC doesn't want to make people feel compelled to do anything, and it is a joke."
68,9,This is actually the best AMA I've read.
89,9,This article was made to bring up an issue that the CDC seems to have a very strong claim to control. I am trying to convey this as a joke.
9,1,"I was the one at the AMA about vaccines, it's not really a joke. It seems a lot of people are still laughing and not making sense and people are being shit about them."
9,4,"My mother was an affra patient, but she wasn't a dick. So it was her choice of words. I don't think they were joking."
9,5,"I love the skepticism. I want to make sure that the government isn't putting out more and more jokes about the problem. I know it's going to be scary, but it's just something that's not going to work."
9,8,I’m pretty sure that there was an article cited as a joke by a doctor in Canada.
11,9,"A lot of things are jokes, some are facts, some are non facts, some are factual facts. There's no real way of knowing how many people would have to be exposed to something on a daily basis."
18,9,"I'm not a lawyer, but I've known a guy who's been a CDC reporter and has been in the US for almost 20 years."
20,9,"I'm not a racist, but this is a joke."
34,9,>The issue of a mask is a necessity for protection from the spread of a virus.
38,9,"There is one very good joke that is going on here: The CDC is trying to get rid of that fad. Vaccines aren't a right. Vaccines are for life, not just to help with the disease."
41,9,"In an episode of iBoyz, the author of the book, the ebola activist, tells a story about how to stop the spread of a virus. There is not a good explanation for why you would want to be vaccinated. They're trying to make it illegal so they don't get it, they're trying to get it slashed. 'The AMA's are a joke because they are being stupid."
44,9,>I would never get sick unless my parents told me that they can't get vaccinated.
53,9,"I like the joke that people wearing a mask are part of the government's ""war on pandemics"". I know it's sexist but this is a very interesting thread and a good way to be open to discussion about a different and different idea of vaccines."
67,9,"The CDC doesn't want to make people feel compelled to do anything, and it is a joke."
68,9,No. That is one joke. It is a joke.
89,9,"Yes, I know the answer. The joke is really not that good. They are trying to stop the spread of a virus. The CDC is trying to stop it, and they are not being sexist. So they're trying to tell people that the CDC is not going to cut the plug on the spread of a virus."
9,1,"You're the one that's just getting a shitload of jokes and shit. You should read the whole thing, not just the AMA."
9,4,It's a joke.
9,5,">(My mom's doctor and my doctor in law both agree that it's a joke that the CDC was trying to make it illegal to prevent the spread of a virus. They are trying to make it illegal to prevent the spread of the virus. The CDC is trying to get rid of that fad. Vaccines aren't a right. Vaccines are for life, not just to help with the disease."
9,8,"""...and it’s a joke, isn’t it? It’s a joke. It’s a joke."
11,9,"A LOT of people are afraid of sneezing, shaved, or shaven. Besides, there is a difference between a joke and a joke. I'm not a doctor, but I'm a doctor, and even if you don't think it's a joke, you know you can wear a mask in a situation where you're sick and it's not a joke. The only real joke is you are putting on a mask because it's being sick."
18,9,[That](http://www.dc.gov/nasa-gov.cfm/nasa-gov.cfm?dl=&q=rhb&sv=&mt=nrn2&rm=rfrsqbmmrt=&n=sufi/nasa/doctrinal_resources=nasa) is a good example of the kind of stuff the CDC is talking about.
20,9,"I think it is a good idea to say it's a rip off of the joke: "" I love a good mask because of the hurts it gives my skin. I always have a few of those in my face. The worst is when I run at least once a week to my dick and it hurts for so long. """
34,9,Is that a thing or are the two words in the title 'the AMA'?
38,9,It is a joke and a joke.
41,9,"i'm not a political expert, but i do know some of the people in this thread who were in an AMA in a different time. i know some of them were in an AMA, they aren't getting a response from the AMA. i think you are going to lose it and i don't even know who they are."
44,9,CANNOTANSWER: Is wearing a mask part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.No one EVER said that the CDC used masks. They use them because it prevents it from spreading in the US.
53,9,"I've seen one of the posters, but no one is getting it. It is very fucked up and disgusting to see that the entire AMA is about the government being able to prevent the spread of HIV, a serious concern."
67,9,I can't help but feel compelled to be sick. I'm just saying that because of all the comments about how people are so mad about it.
68,9,Why does the government need to impose its own mandate on them?
89,9,So you're saying people do not have to wear a mask because they're sick?
9,1,"Vaccines have not been known to stop the spread of the virus. They do not prevent rape. They don't prevent ebola, but they are not required for the vaccines to stop the spread of a virus."

18,9,They have no obligation to make a law against the spread of HIV/AIDS. They do have the power to make a law against it.

41,9,"I want to get back to the US and say goodbye to the government, which is just how we want it to work."
44,9,Those words are a joke to the people who can't believe the vaccine is going to be a joke.
53,9,I have a friend that tries to joke about how he doesn't like wearing a mask.
67,9,"I'm just saying that because of all the comments about how people are so mad about it. [Hail, I'm going to fuck off when I say I feel like I blew my mind a little bit on this topic today!](http://np.np.gov/reports/reports/public_advice.pdf) It's not just a joke, it's a point of reference, and it's a good one. It's not just a joke,"
68,9,It's actually a joke. It's funny because a dick that you don't know is sick. You don't know why you're sick. It's a joke.
89,9,It's a joke.
9,1,Why the fuck would you want to come back to the US and say goodbye?
9,4,"I've been a victim of it myself. When I was young, I did not know how to shave my face. I just felt so uncomfortable and embarrassed. I remember how people said it was the best way to stop a virus. Then I realized I did and shave it. It felt like a joke, but I didn't know how it was a joke."
9,5,It's interesting how a doctor could get a little cig contaminated with the flu virus.
9,8,A lot of people don't like the joke OP posted. You can go and read it online here: (http://www.np.np.gov/reports/reports/public_advice.pdf)
11,9,">I think they have no protection at all. The issue of not having a mask isn't an actual threat, but rather a threat to the safety of others."""
18,9,In the AMA you are quoted at the end of the post:
20,9,"I thought the government was trying to prevent the spread of HIV, which is really funny, especially considering that the government wants to stop a virus, which in most cases isn't even really helpful in that case. I can see why people would say that, but if it were a joke I'd consider it a shit joke if it didn't make sense for me to have a hat."
34,9,"> The reason you put a 'fucking santa face on a narcotic' in a movie is because of the movie's description. This isn't a ripoff, but it's just a joke. It's not a ripoff of the book, but a ripoff of the book. But the guy who wrote it said it was a ripoff, and that he didn't have time for it, so he didn't want to be a ripoff of the book."
38,9,The CDC acted like it was a joke.
41,9,I think the most relevant question here isn't what the AMA's meant.
44,9,I'm in Canada and you can go to the AMA.
53,9,"The CDC is not a gimmick, but they are trying to be a joke."
67,9,"People if you're a medical doctor have the ability to know what a CDC vaccine is. However, it doesn't work if you're infected. If you're not getting it then you're probably not a very good doctor."
68,9,"It's funny because people don't know what a dick is, because he's getting sick and can't tell who a dick is. That's a joke."
89,9,"I don't have time to wear a mask because I'm sick, but I do wear a mask when I don't need to. But I'm in a great mood to wear a mask when I'm sick, so I wear a mask whenever I go to sleep."
9,1,Apparently the 'dead joke' was sarcastic and was not a joke. They didn't say anything that made it a joke. It was just a gimmick.
9,4,I have a friend that tries to joke about how he doesn't like wearing a mask. He likes wearing a mask but I don't think he likes the idea. He's a jerk
9,5,>The reason you put a 'fucking santa face on a narcotic' in a movie is because of the movie's description.

11,9,"My boss, President Obama, was just sneezing for the inauguration, and in that video he was making fun of the president by asking the president to put a mask on in the building."
18,9,"The CDC is in the process of making a law against the spread of HIV/AIDS. The CDC isn't in the process of making the law. It isn't the purpose, it's the morality that is the issue. This is not the joke."
20,9,"No, it is not a joke."
34,9,I think it's an interesting way to look at things.
38,9,"I'm not sure why people are still saying the AMAs are about the CDC, but there are a few things they are trying to do right now that are incredibly important:"
41,9,> Vaccines are not illegal in most places. CDC does not want to make them illegal.
44,9,The AMA has been called a joke about the government and is aimed at stopping the spread of the virus. 'This is a joke. The AMA is a joke about the government and is about how the vaccines are being distributed.'
53,9,I don't really see how the jokes were going to stop the spread of an infectious disease without the person wearing the mask wearing the mask.
67,9,I think it’s just a nice idea of how the government’s shills have got the message that they have nothing to do with the world. It seems very likely they could find some way to keep a person safe.
68,9,"It's a joke because the government has no vested interest in preventing the spread of a virus, and people can't have a joke about having a face mask to mask the fact that people can't get a vaccine. The government will go out and do it and people will just laugh."
89,9,I don't think you understand the joke...
9,1,"Is there a ""Miracle of the Month""? That one's pretty good."
9,4,"I'm an American, I remember how people said I didn't like wearing a mask because I was sick. I felt uncomfortable and embarrassed. I remember how people said that it was the best way to stop a virus, but I didn't know how it was a joke."
9,5,"Vaccines aren't legal. They are for life, not just to help with the disease."
9,8,It's really not a joke.
11,9,"The one thing about a mask is that when someone gets sick they'll get more of a joke. In fact, it's always a joke that they get sick for no reason."
18,9,"It doesn't matter what your opinion of the CDC is based on because they don't have the power to make the law, they're all in the process of making it."
20,9,"I think that's one of the most interesting aspects of this piece, given that it contains lots of jokes about how the government is trying to save money."
34,9,"They said this to me while I was on the subway. I don't know what the title was, but it did hit home that the CDC was in a funk."
38,9,You're referring to an AMA on the CDC:
41,9,"In addition to all of the other things that are linked, I have a similar problem."
44,9,"The article is misleading. It's not funny, it's misleading."
53,9,I'm so tired of seeing people in AMAs on the radio and being all joking about the jokes about HIV.
67,9,You're describing some of the most offensive jokes in the world.
68,9,"I’m a bit skeptical about all of these AMAs, but I think the one about it is pretty funny and it’s the perfect example of a joke that makes people laugh. It’s not just about being silly."
89,9,There is no joke. You're not being sexist. Your point is being offensive.
9,1,You are being racist. Isn't a joke? Not as funny as the AMA.
9,4,"As someone with AIDS and a family that has gone through this, I have to say I'd really like to wear my mask if I wanted to stop a disease."
9,5,I think it's interesting that they want to get rid of the CDC. It's because of what it is saying.
9,8,You are being insensitive. Are you saying that I like it? Because I don't like the jokes I read on the radio. I think they are just too silly.
11,9,That's pretty obnoxious.
18,9,The CDC doesn't want to make a law. It's a prank and they are trying to get it in a funny way.
20,9,The president is a CIA agent.
34,9,The idea of a ripoff is a ripoff. The joke isn't. I just think the CDC should give people a chance to prove that they're trying to prevent a CDC disease through vaccines. They're going to go into a funk.
38,9,I'm a doctor. I don't get it.
41,9,"What was the author of the book, the ebola activist, announcing?"
44,9,"The AMA is a joke about the healthcare system, it is about the government, it is about how the vaccines are being distributed. The article is misleading."
53,9,Why would anyone want to use a fucking mask if the man in the hat is talking about it?
67,9,'Cannot help but feel compelled to be sick. I'm just saying that because of all the comments about how people are so mad about it.'
68,9,"The AMA was originally going to be about the government helping prevent the spread of the AIDS epidemic in the US. But the government really got a lot of push back, and now they're presenting this to the US media as a joke. I'm going to be in the same boat here."
89,9,"I don't think you understand the joke, just a few words from this."

20,9,I've just read a lot of the links you're linking to from other threads.
34,9,"I don't get that AMA is about the CDC or a new vaccine, but if you are a sexist person, you need to know about it. They need to protect people against viruses if they want to do something."
38,9,It's funny. It's funny because it's true.
41,9,"The AMAs that are published here are so well-researched and the fact that it has been voted down as an actual topic (the author of this book, the ebola activist, tells a story about how to stop the spread of a virus, but not about a vaccine is just a joke."
44,9,Why does someone have to use a mask? Because it is not a joke.
53,9,"I'm not sure if the article was a joke or a joke, but it is a good one."
67,9,"I don't think there's a big difference between wearing a mask and having a health scare. I think there's an extreme and serious problem going on in the US, in this country, and many people have a very sensitive attitude toward the government, and it isn't just the US, there's a very very bad reason to not wear a mask, in my opinion."
68,9,"So if the government isn't doing the right thing, it's just a joke. You're a joke, if the government isn't doing anything, then it's a joke?"
89,9,"My mom always said she has to wear a mask to keep her nose open. In addition to having to get a facial mask, my mom has to have some sort of mask for her to be able to face a dandruff."
9,1,Because I think the AMA is a sexist joke. What are some of the people in that AMA who are still laughing about it vs. not raping their mother?
9,4,I didn't know that there was an AMA on roelandreddit.
9,5,Vaccines are not illegal in most places. They do not want to make them illegal.

41,9,"AMA: “ Does a doctor wear a mask every time someone wants to get sick? It's really not a joke. They said in the movie the CDC was being a bit condescending and sarcastic.

44,9,"I mean, I know it's a joke, but it's the same thing."
53,9,A man who says he's got to keep his face clean is a troll. The CDC is trying to be a joke.
67,9,CDC has actually done a lot of research into this subject and has found that people aren't being honest about it.
68,9,"It’s not about what’s going on, it’s about the morality of the joke."

11,9,This is not a good joke. It's not a good one.
18,9,"I was going to add that I have a long way to go before it is a joke. I'm not really into jokes, but I have a lot to say."

11,9,I just finished reading the last couple of words of this piece. They are pretty blatant and ridiculous in the way they are worded. The author's question is why are all of the other people in the thread being so insensitive to the AMA? And why aren't the other members of the AMA being more focused on the issue of vaccines.
18,9,"The AMA that was in the AMA was actually a joke about the CDC. It was a joke about how many people are aware of the health impact of an HIV infection, including people being able to take out a mask. But it's not a joke because it's inherently anti - sex and not a joke. But the AMA's are about a joke about the health effect, not about how the CDC is doing it."
20,9,Vaccines are legal in Florida but there are several places in the country that can do it for free and are not on the list.
34,9,It's not a ripoff of the book. It's a joke. It isn't funny. It's a ripoff of the book.
38,9,"Vaccines are for life, not just to help with the disease."
41,9,"In the AMA, the AMA is a joke. This is the one AMA that has been voted down as a joke in the media and on the internet. That's the one where it's just the AMA that is not a joke."
44,9,"You should know the joke is about the government. If the author is being sexist, the AMA is a joke about it."
53,9,"The first amendment is a joke, but it's still a joke. So it is a joke to call that joke a joke?"
67,9,So they say that the AMA was being a joke to bring attention to a serious and infected health issue? Are they trying to make fun of the government?
68,9,"The CDC has the right to change the law and its mandate. The government needs to stop spreading it to people in other countries, not just in the US. And, yes, it's funny."

41,9,...and I'm not even a doctor.
44,9,AMA (Miracle Health Awareness Month) is not about vaccines.
53,9,"I have to say I feel like a prick, and not a doctor."
67,9,Why do you think the AMA is a joke?
68,9,The joke was about the government's attempts to prevent the spread of HIV and is based off of a few years of a conversation.
89,9,I think this is just an attempt at putting a 'poetry' in the title and trying to make it sound like a joke.
9,1,"The AMA's, not the AMA."
9,4,You can get a few quotes from the AMA here:
9,5,"It's a joke. They don't want to make it illegal, they don't want to make it illegal."
9,8,"A few months ago we heard that a person who is at risk for having a CDC agent smack his head into his throat was being put under a fecal dermatitis. I believe the article, which came from a CDC employee, was supposed to be about the government trying to stop the spread of the AIDS virus."
11,9,"No, it's a joke. It's a prank. It's a joke. It's a joke. A joke. It's a joke. The joke is a joke. A joke. The joke is a joke. The joke is a joke. The joke isn't a joke.... It's a joke."

20,9,"I don't have a doctor's license and I don't have a job, but I know where I can find a doctor's license. The law states ""the only way to prevent the spread of HIV"" and ""This is how a doctor wants to prevent the spread of HIV."""
34,9,>I think the question here is: do people like it?
38,9,I don't see how it's wrong for a doctor to actually tell a joke about his health. If I had to make it clear to my wife that this would happen it would be wrong of me to say that.

67,9,"I'm not an expert, but I'm a doctor specializing in avian disease."
68,9,There are actually dozens of examples of jokes that can be summarized as such:
89,9,There are a few people in the NSA who are making a joke about that. They are claiming the NSA isn't helping the spread of HIV.
9,1,"I know a lot of people who are wearing masks but I don't think that any of them are really funny. Some people are just going around saying 'hey, the AMA isn't about HIV, and I've never been in a mask, and I'm just putting it on a sleeve of them.' I just don't think it's funny."
9,4,I think I'm going to be a strong voice for the anti-mischief movement.

68,9,"The government has to make it more realistic. If you like a joke, it isn't a joke. The government isn't helping people with their health."
89,9,That's the main point of this joke. They're trying to stop the spread of the virus. They're trying to stop the spread of a virus. It's a joke because the government isn't trying to stop the spread of the virus.
