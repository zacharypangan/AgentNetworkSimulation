57,46,excellent exandle of the importance and reliance of everyone in the community to do their part the people that put themselves at risk everyday so you can have food safely produced and delivered to you to eat it s not hard to wear a mask on a run

87,46,i m wearing a mask outside while vaccinated because people like you are in my face why does it bother you to the point that you are asking random people why they are doing something that makes them feel safe
98,46,i like wearing a mask because i can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows

46,8,I am really surprised by how often we get a mask like this on when we walk out of a store or restaurant.
46,41,I would much rather go to the health department and put on a mask.
50,46,'Covid' is not a disease.
52,46,It was great talking to you yesterday but you seem to be putting too much pressure on the president to enforce the mask mandate. It just sounds like a terrible excuse.
57,46,"I don t get it.. I am on a biker run and there is a guy on the sidewalk with a mask.. If you go on that trail, you don t get to go with a mask.."
59,46,Vaccinating children during the pandemic is the right thing to do.
61,46,'Making it up' is just a bit of an old fashioned joke that was brought up in school.
65,46,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.as uncomfortable as it may be especially with the conditions we work in i d rather adapt wear the mask and survive than contract the virus bc of what s more comfortable as uncomfortable as it may be especially with the conditions we work in i d rather adapt wear the mask and survive than contract the virus bc of what s more comfortable
82,46,I wish more people had the opportunity to explain what the government is doing
83,46,"We have a new program in place to help protect people from virus infected with TB. A simple program with masks has been a huge success. They work very well in the field and can stop spread, and it is useful for people to do their part."
87,46,I do not have any personal information. I have an infection in my nose that isn't going away.
98,46,"In a nutshell, the only thing I can do for myself is get dressed with a fat lip in and then a dark hat."
46,7,I think I’m going to take a deep breath and read this. But I like how this is not an important topic.
46,8,My nan is getting a full face dick shat in the face. Then she shows up. We need to have a face mask.
46,41,"I love to run into people in public, as I've been in the field, and have never seen anyone get sick on their own. It's like they say, We've got a new program."
50,46,And I'm pretty sure that's why the government has a right to not wear a mask.
52,46,"If you don't have a mask, you don't have a right to be on it. It's more important than the fact that people don't have to wear it. And it's not something I can say with certainty, because it's pretty common in America. That's just the way it is."
57,46,What the fuck is a tidbit about the government?
59,46,"The CDC is going to have a lot of scary cases of COVI, so maybe you should call the CDC? What a fun day!"
61,46,>The first paragraph was written as an attempt to discourage people from wearing a mask while walking to work.
65,46,"As someone with a virus, my instincts are to wear a mask. I always wear it, but because a doctor or nurse thinks of me as being vulnerable to the virus, I take a second look and see if I can recover from it, so I give it another try..."
82,46,I think it's helpful and also pretty useful if you can impose a new protection order that if you don't understand the reason behind it and keep in mind it's not an incredibly sane thing to do.
83,46,"I see that we don't need to put masks on people in their new home. And when you're not doing much walking, you can always stop and do whatever you want, especially if you have to walk all the way to a hospital."
87,46,"If I was going to ask people, I would tell them I had an infection in my nose and that I was wearing a mask outside while I was vaccinated. Then I could ask my doctor if I was wearing a mask outside while vaccinated."
98,46,"It's not a joke, it's a very important one. Wearing a mask to prevent a viral infection is the worst way to stop it, but it's useless and I hate it."
46,7,I don’t think I understand the meaning of ‘supposed to be a tidbit about the government’.
46,8,It sounds like you're on the right side of an interesting topic...
46,41,"I was born in Massachusetts, and my doctor had a job with a TB infection. It was so serious that he had to put me in a mask. He couldn't figure out what I was going to do, and I didn't want to make the mistake of having a mouth full with a face mask. I couldn't do anything about it. It was just a joke."
50,46,What does that say about the federal government?
52,46,I was in a medical school in california and I thought it was a great idea to put out a'mask'.
57,46,This is a really good joke. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
59,46,People wear masks to protect themselves from HIV. I think you're missing the point that wearing a mask can help prevent COVI transmission in a small percentage of cases because it can be treated with an antimicrobial.
61,46,"If it makes you feel better, I would wear a mask. I am sorry but I also feel bad because of the scar that is a part of mexican flu and I just don't know about it."
65,46,"People wear masks to stay in the habit, not to get sick. People wear them to stay in the habit, not to get sick."
82,46,"There's no reason to remove a mask and wear a helmet. And what's more, a shield is an essential part of protecting against the spread of a virus."
83,46,I know what you mean! I think we need more fads. But it's actually pretty easy to give them an incentive to be more protective than the government.
87,46,Vaccines are for life. It's not just a routine thing.
98,46,"That's a pretty good way to say that if you have a sick friend with an infection and you wear a mask, then you are very likely to have to make him wear one."
46,7,">I think I’m going to take a deep breath and read this. But I like how this is not an important topic.', 'I think I’m going to take a deep breath and read this. But I like how this is not an important topic."
46,8,You're talking about the government.
46,41,I don't think I understand the meaning of ‘supposed to be a tidbit about the government’. What does that say about the federal government?
50,46,OP's a liar and he sounds like he has a bad idea.
52,46,"I'm not sure why you're being downvoted. It's an incredibly simple but very vile problem and you should have the full respect of the whole government, and the community at large."
57,46,"I'm not saying this as a joke but as an excuse for not being vaccinated as a part of the prevention measures deployed by the government, i can honestly say it's a really good joke, but i just want to say that I can honestly say the same about people who wear masks while working, and they seem to be not putting themselves at risk because they're wearing masks that are unnecessary to the workplace."
59,46,"People wear a mask to protect themselves from HIV, not just a vaccine, it prevents it from spreading."
61,46,It doesn't make you a bad person. The 'Always wear a mask and you'll be able to make it happen' joke is about a joke where people will come out of the bathroom with a mask and put it in a place of rest.
65,46,i just had a good one of those days when i was so sick that i wore a mask to see if it worked.
82,46,Isn't the mask a kind of safety device? And that's about it.
83,46,"Yes it is. If there are a lot of people with TB in America who don't want to have to wear a mask to be safe from HIV and the government doesn't care about them, I would have to see a doctor."
87,46,I want to clarify: I don't know why I think that the AMA is so successful:
98,46,I'm going to be honest: It's really funny.
46,7,">Isn't the mask a kind of safety device? And that's about it. Yes it. If there are a lot of people with TB in America who don't want to have to wear a mask to be safe from HIV and the government doesn't care about them, I would have to see a doctor."
46,8,Wearing a mask to protect yourself from HIV is a basic precaution.
46,41,I mean I would go to the office and put on a mask.
50,46,"I've always wondered if the government just put a lot of emphasis on the gov't's failure to protect children, as if it was a joke. Regardless of whether they were vaccinated, it seems like all the people who care about the spread of a virus, especially children, know something that it's not. Vaccination is the only cure."
52,46,"Because you don't have to be in the middle of a run, because it's cold outside."
57,46,"I don't know if there is any evidence that the government is using a turban to stop pandemics, but I do know that it's used to help combat the spread of a virus."
59,46,[Wheels are part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.The government is being oblivious to a fact. I think the most important thing for people in need to do is to get tested before being vaccinated.
61,46,"CANNOTANSWER](https://www.stfu.edu/news/context/fshfu/science-review/fss_request_vaccination_admission_to_france/fshf/fsstv-rtd-ffndhhcihc) is actually the ""irrational, indulging, and sickening"" version of the joke."
65,46,">Is this the real reason for the fear in the US? There is something you can do with your mask that won't let you in, like bringing it to a party with a mask on and the mask on."
82,46,"He doesn't want to be a doctor. He wants to be a lawyer, and he wants to stop people from getting sick. He wants to be a doctor, and not a politician."
83,46,"I don't know if this was intended for me, but i am not sure if I'd want to get the government to buy a mask because of how much I hate the masked system. It has the tendency to make people look as if they're doing the same thing as I am, and it is a good way to entice the people to wear masked and not want to have to worry about the people at work because I don't think it's funny."
87,46,"I would not have had a problem with the mask, especially when the first infection came out of my nose. I would have had a hard time making eye contact."
98,46,"""I'm going to be honest: It's really funny. What you don't understand is that a mask is part of a joke. I am not saying that the people I know that wear masks are all jokes, but that the joke is not one of them."""
46,7,No. It is a joke. There's not one of these jokes I've ever heard. And this was actually a joke from the AMA.
46,8,There's no need to talk about the government. There's no way in hell the government could even try and prevent the spread of the virus.
46,41,"It would be very funny to be in a public health care professional, so why should the government care about it?"
50,46,Vaccination is the only cure. They don't just have a mandate but they also have a mandate to give people vaccinations.
52,46,I'm sure you're not the only one who thinks that a mask is a joke in order to prevent pandemics?

82,46,"No, this isn't ""right"", it's ""the government is acting to prevent the spread of a virus."" The government's doing nothing about it. This is a symptom of a virus, not a symptom."
83,46,"It's a good way to make people uncomfortable and take advantage of the danger. But, there is a difference in how people are treated and how they feel when they're sick. Vaccines are legal, but they don't do anything to help people."
87,46,I think the AMA is good because its in its rightful place.

57,46,"I have a turban and a hat and a hat, a hat, a mask, a mask, a mask, a mask, a mask, a mask, a mask, a mask, a mask, and a mask, a mask. I drew a line that goes something like ""My life and this life is not my life and this life is not my life."""
59,46,"People wear masks to prevent COVI a few times. I was wondering why you did this when you were a child, since the parents wore their masks all the time. Vaccines are a very obnoxious, ridiculous, dangerous drug. I was wondering why you did this when you were a child, since the parents wore their masks all the time. Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of a virus. Vaccines are a very obnoxious, ridiculous, dangerous drug."
61,46,The joke is 'People who wear a mask are scumbags and don't know what vaccinations they should have and don't want to wear them.
65,46,"I'd say it's not a good way to prevent infection. It's a good way to prevent illness, but it's also a very bad way to spread it."
82,46,"He's being sarcastic because he wants to be a doctor and not a politician. And yet, he has to wear a mask to prevent a disease. He can't stop people from getting sick."

87,46,Certainly the AMA is good because its in its rightful place.
98,46,You think it's funny that the joke is a joke? Or maybe he's putting a mask on when the joke isn't.
46,7,...and I don't think there is a difference between the government and the public.

46,41,"> There is something you can do with your mask that won't let you in, like bringing it to a party with a mask on and the mask on."
50,46,Yes. But this is the point.
52,46,I know it's not a joke but this has some nitpicking going on. I think it's a tad misleading to make a joke about a virus.
57,46,"Well, you are wrong. It is a joke, but that doesn't mean you are correct."
59,46,"""Waking a mask can help prevent COVI transmission in a small percentage of cases because it can be treated with an antimicrobial."""
61,46,Is there anything that the government needs to say to a kid? I have heard there's no way to give out vaccines unless a child is vaccinated.
65,46,"I've seen a number of places in my life where I've been in my masks and the problem is not only that it prevents infection, but also that it's a good way to protect myself and others, which i can understand for someone who has no control over a virus."
82,46,"I don't know why people are saying this, but I am a doctor so I know the issue with TB and TB is something they should have a discussion about."
83,46,"I don't know if it's intended for me or if it's intended for me, but i do think that masks are a joke and I don't think they are required, but they aren't."
87,46,"I wouldn't say a'relationship' is what the AMA is about, it's a very generalized statement that the AMA isn't about protecting children."

46,7,"This was not just a joke, it's a piece of nonsense. I don't know how the AMA works, but it's a joke based on actual information that would make it into the AMA's headline."

59,46,Vaccines are for life.
61,46,"Vaccine is a huge deal in the world, especially when it's not the official goal of the government. It's just a joke with a bit of jargon."
65,46,"I see a big problem with the masks. I think a lot of people wear them to stay safe, even if they are actually a prick for doing something like this. People are not just wearing masks to stop the spread of HIV. They are putting a little extra pressure on you to get a mask and also for getting that contaminated patient."
82,46,"a mask is a medical device, if there is a problem with it it's to stop the spread of the TB."
83,46,"Vaccines are legally legal, but you would have to have a mask to prevent infections."
87,46,I think the government will start trying to push it more seriously than a single AMA in the US.
98,46,"I'm pretty sure that if a person can't be the best person on earth to make a joke about a mask, it's not a joke."
46,7,This is ridiculous. I'm not asking people what kind of joke is this.

52,46,"I don't know about you, but a CDC employee isn't going to get the vaccine. The CDC isn't gonna help, nor will they help."
57,46,It's not a joke. A joke. It's not a joke. It's a joke. Vaccines are legal. Because vaccines are dangerous. They are not necessary. They are a very dangerous drug. They are legal.
59,46,"Why are there so many people wearing masks, as in they're not able to prevent spread?"
61,46,The government needs to make people aware that they are getting vaccines.
65,46,You can only wear it in public.
82,46,The best way to combat TB and TB in America is to tell people that it's a symptom of a virus. You get a new TB Virus vaccine every year. A virus that doesn't have a mask is a symptom of TB.
83,46,"I like the way they say ""The government is not legally required"" in this thread, and not ""I am saying if I'm not permitted to wear a mask on a job, then I'd have to see a doctor."""
87,46,"The article describes how people think the AMA is the best way to prevent disease. It does not mention the government is pushing it, but rather that the government is a force."
98,46,"I am not going to go into details here, but I'm going to say that a mask makes a joke. In fact, I think it's a joke to me that the CDC is telling people to keep them on. 'They are saying ""Waring a mask"" isn't a joke."
46,7,"The joke is based on information that makes it into the AMA's headline."""
46,8,""" I don't think people want to see people wearing my mask all the time to prevent a cold."""

52,46,"CDC trying to create a joke about women getting sick while running, the government is trying to make a joke about men not getting sick."
57,46,"I know how the media reacts, but I'm pretty sure the joke will not be as valid as the joke."
59,46,"I have had a friend who is trying to keep people from getting sick, even with the fact that he's wearing a mask. It's not the government's job to prevent the spread of a virus. It's the government's job to get sick. It's not even a joke. The fact that he has to wear a mask is a big red flag, and the government is oblivious to a fact."
61,46,"That movie is a joke. There are plenty of people who have no idea what a virus is, but don't want to have one. If you're not a good doctor, you shouldn't be trying to protect yourself. The reason vaccines are legal is that they protect you from all types of viruses. If you're not in the right place to be, you should start having a conversation."
65,46,"[By the way, I'm a nurse and have no control over the spread of a virus]."
82,46,Isn't a mask supposed to be meant to protect people from a virus?
83,46,"If you don't want to have to see a doctor, you need to wear a mask."
87,46,"It's not a joke, it's a jibe."

50,46,We need a mask. It's a good thing we do it. There's nothing wrong with it.
52,46,I've read many of the articles on here. It has an unsettling tone and it's difficult to find any examples of how the US government can actually be at fault. There are people here that have been vaccinated and they were not able to stop it as well. The only thing that remained was the fact that the person being targeted by the CDC is just using the CDC for what it is and how they are attempting to make a joke. The whole thing is a joke.
57,46,"If you have been at work all week, you're gonna have to wear a turban for a while, but you don't want a scar in your neck, and you need to put on a mask for a while."
59,46,I've been told the doctors are not required to give vaccinations to patients who do not have a medical license. Vaccines are actually a joke.
61,46,That's a really bad joke.
65,46,"... and also, you know, they want you to get vaccinated asap because you need to have a physical body. You can’t put a mask on someone you don’t trust."
82,46,I don't really see a joke here. People who think that masks are meant to stop a virus. That's just a symptom of a virus. The CDC is doing nothing about it.
83,46,"I'm sorry, but I don't think people should be allowed to make it into a ""joke."""
87,46,You're probably just wondering why he's going to not give a shit about if he's allergic to vaccines.
98,46,"I think the other comments are simply more about how they are being used, rather than a joke."
46,7,"What a joke. Until recently, it was a joke, now it's a joke."
46,8,"I mean, the problem is not that the US government is responsible for the virus, but that they can't be bothered to change it."
46,41,Vaccines are supposed to prevent illness.
50,46,I don't even like the notion of saying that a mask is the solution to the problems that the government is trying to solve.
52,46,A friend of mine is a vaccine specialist and he was at a CDC event where he got tested for a HIV infection and he got an AMA. He says it was the biggest joke of the day in my life. The entire thing was a joke. The AMA is incredibly important.
57,46,"I don't get why people think I can't be a joke but the joke isn't that. I know that the joke is just a joke, but it's funny that people use their own words to explain a joke."
59,46,The CDC is not in the lead but they should make a policy change to be able to do what the CDC does.
61,46,Vaccine is legal because they protect against all types of viruses. It's a joke because it's a joke and the government needs to say it.
65,46,"It's not just about not getting sick, it's about the need to know that they're not doing anything, even if they're not in a hurry."
82,46,>Making is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
83,46,"Yes, it's a joke and it's not a joke. You know a doctor would be able to prescribe it without going to a doctor."
87,46,AMA is actually a joke
98,46,Is it possible to have an autoimmune disorder because of a mask? I think this is a great post.
46,7,I think the biggest issue in the AMA is the question of why doctors will take you out of your office because you are allergic to HIV. There are lots of doctors out there that work with people who have HIV.
46,8,"As an American, I think you know how important a 'joke' is to you."
46,41,The AMA is not a joke. It's a joke.
50,46,Vaccination is the only cure and the government has been trying to provide a symptom.
52,46,"Having been diagnosed with the virus is a problem in and of itself. It's not as if a vaccine prevents the spread of it. It's not like they just enact an anti-vaccination approach to prevent the spread of the virus. The first part is a pretty vile thing to have in the world, and it doesn't have to be a joke.

98,46,I wore a mask in high school for an appointment. I think it made me feel safer because I was going out to party and I got a mask that he just wore when I was in public. I still feel terrible and my wife thinks it is the most appropriate thing to wear when she gets sick.

46,8,So basically this: I know the AMA of a doctor. That's why he has to wear a mask and tells us what it's like to be a doctor. But I don't know if he has to do it to get a sick person to get sick.

50,46,I reread that title and then I had to think about this a bit.
52,46,This is a really good point and one that's really needed in the debate - is this the kind of thing that everyone does?
57,46,I don't think that the entire purpose of a joke is to stop the spread of a virus.
59,46,I don't get why people have to wear masks.
61,46,It sounds like a joke. The joke is not about the government trying to stop the spread of a virus.
65,46,"I think your response to this is really weird, because I have a virus and I can relate to it and can relate to it in different ways."

65,46,I'd also love to be told that the CDC's incompetence was due to a lack of proper protection of the skin.
82,46,That is why I want to start a subreddit where people like this come up to discuss the problems that the government is attempting to solve. Not the problem with being a doctor. It is not the problem with the government. It is the problem with the government.
83,46,This is a great question. I can't help but wonder what the reason is.
87,46,AMAs are about prevention. It is about preventing the spread of a virus.
98,46,I'm a big fan of the idea of wearing a mask. You do not want to fuck with an autoimmune disease.
46,7,I'm not sure where the AMA comes from but the question of who is more responsible for how things are written and acted is a question.
46,8,"I'm not a doctor, but I do see that the government is working to prevent the spread of the virus, but the AMA's and the AMA are not intended to be a joke. They are about the lack of the health care system. AMA's are about preventing the spread of the virus, but the government is trying to stop it."
46,41,"I was trying to go to school. Then I walked in with a blank face and a mask on. It was a total messed up experience. I'm not gonna lie, I'm a little tired. I went to school with a man who didn't want to be an asshole and the doctor was the only person I could speak to that did that. I was told that I shouldn't have to talk to a doctor or anything."
50,46,“The government is trying to become a joke” (I don’t really like the concept)
52,46,"CANNOTANSWER, MD:"
57,46,So you know what is funny?
59,46,"> ""I think the most important thing for people in need to do is to get tested before being vaccinated.'"
61,46,I'd like to say the last sentence has been in my mind for a long time.
65,46,'The CDC is trying to make a joke about the CDC's failures to protect kids. It's not a joke in the sense that people haven't actually taken any steps to protect themselves. It's a joke about a joke about the CDC's failures to protect kids.
82,46,"It's a joke. If someone says it's the government's job, then there's no need for it. This is a joke."
83,46,If you read the comments you'll see the first part:
87,46,"It's like saying 'Cannot make a joke, isn't it?'"
98,46,I don't have a job. I just like to see people dressed like people to protect me from HIV.
46,7,I'm so sorry this happened.
46,8,AMA's are about stopping the spread of the virus. AMA's are about preventing the spread of the virus.
46,41,"You said this was all a joke, not a joke!"
50,46,"If that were the case then no. I would make an effort to make it a joke. I would tell the government to not give you any health coverage if you want. If it is no use, then it is a joke."
52,46,"CANNOTANSWER, MD"
57,46,The point of the joke is essentially to stop the spread of a disease.
59,46,"What did it say? It was a joke a couple years ago, and it made it sound like it was a joke a couple years ago."
61,46,"If you're not a doctor, I don't think you are a good doctor. I don't think there's anything wrong with that. It's a joke about people that need to get vaccinations."
65,46,"> People are not just wearing masks to stop the spread of a virus. I think that the first part of the article isn't really a joke at all, it's just a joke. ""I'm not a medical professional, I'm the NSA."" The CDC is trying to make a joke about the government's failures to protect children."
82,46,"The AMA is supposed to help people with TB. I'm not sure why, but this is a good way to explain it to people. It is not a joke because it is a joke because it makes people feel better about it, which is just not a joke."
83,46,"There's a problem, though."
87,46,"AMA is an important element of the AMA. I have never been vaccinated myself, and it does not do much to prevent that :("
98,46,Having been told that in this situation that the CDC is threatening to kill a lot of people in the near future (even if not the least) it doesn't seem like a reasonable place to start. It's a joke. It's a joke.
46,7,The article in question is a joke. The point of the joke is to stop the spread of the virus.
46,8,AMAs are a joke about a joke.
46,41,"AMA, NOT joke AMA, NOT AMA."
50,46,It is a joke. The AMA is a joke about the government's failure to protect children.

57,46,Vaccines are not legally required unless you are a physician. Vaccines are not legally required unless you are a doctor.
59,46,[NAME] from the Texas Department of Health.
61,46,I've never heard of a joke about vaccinations. I've heard that there's a law in the US for the government to do it.
65,46,"I believe the article said the CDC acted under a false pretense of humor, which they claim isn't, or who is behind the story, being incompetent."
82,46,"The AMA is not about the government, but a lot more about the government and its work against TB."
83,46,They're doing this because they think it's a joke.

57,46,I don't think the joke is funny.
59,46,"What was the point of the joke? A guy in this thread called them ""jobs that are done to protect people."""

82,46,They're not actually actually trying to stop the spread of TB. They're just trying to make fun of the government and try to push the problem away.
83,46,"I have to go get the doctor, it's in my budget, I have to pay for it!"
87,46,Its an AMA. The AMA is an attempt to prevent a virus. The AMA is about prevention. It is not a joke because it is the government's only action.
98,46,"If you like wearing a mask to protect yourself, then you should get on it. Not the joke itself. Wearing one doesn't make it funny."
46,7,"The AMA is really about preventing the spread of TB. But we do have people who have had to have a vaccine, who have been able to get them away from us because of this."
46,8,What's the point of the AMA?
46,41,The AMA is about the government splicing vaccines in to protect people from getting sick and preventing the spread of TB.
50,46,"What a raging snob, it's a nonsense AMA. You do it and it's no joke."
52,46,"And there is also the word ""joke"" in the title, which says ""I do know that the CDC is trying to make a joke about the HSVM vaccine."""
57,46,You mean it's funny?
59,46,"I'm not sure why they're making fun of the government, but the truth is that in a world where nobody really wants to go to school for vaccines, this joke is made up by a government official."
61,46,A doctor's joke isn't a joke. It is a joke. A doctor's joke isn't a joke. A doctor's joke is a joke. A doctor's joke is a joke. A doctor's joke is a joke.

The article also states that there is a joke in the headline that people are wearing a mask and don't want to get to know if they can get vaccinated."
82,46,"People like the AMA. This is a joke, not the AMA."
83,46,I can see the whole thing in comics being a joke. I can tell you that the point of the joke is to prevent people from getting sick. I can also see how the government is trying to change the joke.
87,46,"I have no hunch about being allergic to the vaccine, but it's the truth. The AMA is a joke. It's not a joke. It's about how to prevent infection. AMA is about prevention, not about the spread of a virus."

50,46,You're a joke. It's a joke because it's a combination of medication and therapy to help prevent the spread of a virus.
52,46,"The CDC isn't pushing it too hard. The CDC is trying to make it look like they're doing the right thing. The AMA is a joke, not a joke."

61,46,"The people who say ""If you're not a good doctor, I don't think you are a good doctor."" isn't a joke. A joke is one of the two things that is supposed to be used as a joke. I would definitely put on a mask if I were you."
65,46,"Considering that it's the government's job to help people vaccinate, I'd be interested to hear how they're addressing this."
82,46,"I am not sure I agree with this one, but there are a few things I will have to talk about during the AMA:"
83,46,I don't think the government is trying to change the joke. I think that it's an incredibly clever way of using humor.
87,46,"My first response was, ""The AMA is a joke, the thing I love is that it tries to be hilarious, and it’s based on fact. It doesn’t work."""
98,46,I see nothing wrong with being a doctor with a mask to prevent a virus. You're being sexist. And I'm sure most people don't agree with you that being a doctor is a joke. The CDC is trying to stop the spread of HIV. But they're trying to make a joke that the government can't stop the spread of HIV. A lot of people wear masks in order to stop the spread of HIV. And if they are not trying to stop it from spreading it then it will fail if they don't use them.
46,7,AMA: [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME] [NAME]
46,8,"I think you're referring to the way we equate the two AMAs, which is the kind of joke that's only a joke when it's the AMA, and not just the AMA."
46,41,I would definitely put it on the AMA.
50,46,"This is one of the worst things you can do in your free time. I'd be happy if I did this to my kids, but I'd feel bad about doing it to myself and I'd still be unable to go out to the doctors."
52,46,I’d like to agree with the others on this.
57,46,I think the joke is really funny. It's funny because you don't have a choice and it's funny because it makes it very awkward for someone else to take your place. It's also funny because that person would just be embarrassed to be wearing a hat while in a job. It's the joke that's funny.
59,46,"The best part is that it's a joke that's made up. I mean, it sounds like it's a joke."
61,46,That joke isn't a joke. A gimmick is a joke.
65,46,"They also spit out ""obvious misunderstandings that are being blown up by a joke of some sort"" as part of their ad for the movie."
82,46,"As a Doctor, I think the AMA is about the government. Not the government's job. The AMA. AMAs are about the government, but the government."
83,46,"In the UK you get a drug without a prescription, and a doctor prescribes one. That's not legal at all."
87,46,AMA is a joke because it's based on facts.
98,46,"It's a joke, but its a joke. It's an autoimmune disease and it's going to be a very scary situation, and you can be a little uncomfortable."
46,7,"You're a joke. You should not be wearing a mask to stop the spread of HIV. If you get HIV, you should not be wearing a mask to get it. Then again, you'll have to deal with a lot of risks associated with the AMA."
46,8,"This is the joke you're talking about. It's not intended to be a joke, it's to do a joke about what's going on in the healthcare industry and what's not."
46,41,"So the joke isn't a joke, it's about something else that people are a little too insensitive to."
50,46,"So, he didn't say he would wear a mask. The article didn't say that he would wear a mask or go outside for a month, and then the president said he would keep going to the doctor for the vaccine."
52,46,"""I don't need to be a doctor to get the vaccine."
57,46,"""I think it's funny"""
59,46,"I'm a doctor, and I think you're right. A joke is not a joke and the CDC is attempting to make it illegal."
61,46,"The whole point of the joke is ""sad people have no idea what the virus is, and have no idea how to make a joke about it, but that's because I've always felt it was funny and made the joke about me."
65,46,YES! It's a joke about the CDC and their failures to protect people.
82,46,"I would like to add to my conversation that if there was some kind of government mandate to protect against the spread of a virus, I would want people to do it."
83,46,But do they still have to go to a doctor? Do they have to ask anyone to get a prescription?
87,46,The government is actually trying to push vaccinations but not the health of the public.
98,46,I've learned to appreciate the jokes of people who do not believe in it.
46,7,"So the main objective of a AMA is to stop the spread of HIV, and stop a lot of people from getting it."
46,8,"AMAs can actually be a bit more serious than a joke. They may be a good way to stop the spread of the disease, but they are also a joke because it's about something else."
46,41,I'm not sure if you're just a twat about this but I do know that I'm a twat about that stuff. I don't want to look into any more things.
50,46,I don't like the idea of people wearing a mask or go outside to get vaccinated or something. I like the idea that people have to go to the doctor if they want to be protected from HIV because it isn't a joke.
52,46,"The second part of the joke was the joke, not the whole thing."
57,46,"""What is the point of a joke?"
59,46,I'm in the US. This is a joke that has nothing to do with a joke. It is the same joke that a doctor was making fun of a few years ago. This is a joke.
61,46,That's the joke. A joke is a joke. A joke is a joke. A joke is a joke. A joke is a joke.
65,46,"CDC and the CDC, as a whole are all putting together a joke about the fact that they're trying to prevent the spread of AIDS."
82,46,Because a doctor isn't a doctor. He's a doctor.
83,46,What does the US government do about TB?
87,46,">To be honest, I don't think I'm joking. I just thought that's a joke."
98,46,I am just being sarcastic about the fact that I'm not sure you'd like to believe that it's a joke.
46,7,I'm gonna have to read this. But I'm going to go read this. But I can't...
46,8,"I know this is a joke, but it's not about the health care system."
46,41,"AMAs are made about what they mean. Not'supposed' to be a joke, but 'as a joke'."
50,46,>It seems like the government is trying to be funny by going out to the doctors and talking to the public about vaccinations.
52,46,"The CDC is trying to make a joke about the HSVM vaccine, and the people who want to go to the doctor don't get it. It's a joke, but it's not a joke. It's a joke, but it's a joke."
57,46,I don't think it is funny.
59,46,"""The CDC is not in the lead but they should make a policy change to be able to do what the CDC does."""
61,46,>I read a whole article about this with the title of the joke and that it's funny.
65,46,There's a recurring theme here:
82,46,You've probably heard of the AMA AMA before? It's the name of a subreddit where you can find info and videos on how to stop the spread of TB and it's AMA AMA.
83,46,"In America, people with TB are not allowed to get the masked, but only the masked version of the vaccines."
87,46,"""The AMA is a joke. It is about how to prevent a virus. It is about how to prevent the spread of a virus. It is about protecting the public. There’s no reason to avoid the joke, not just to protect the public."
98,46,"I don't think that the word 'hoe' is correct, but that 'hoe' isn't that relevant."
46,7,"It's kind of funny that a doctor or nurse who is giving out advice about a mask in public, or who's telling you about a problem they're talking about in the AMA, would say something like ""Oh no!"" for no reason. I wonder how he would say that. I wonder if they're referring to this as ""the joke that was made to annoy the CDC."" or if it's a joke that is made by the government, since it's based on actual information, then the truth that people have been a joke"
46,8,"No. AMAs aren't a joke. They're a joke about the fact that there's no actual way to stop the spread of the virus, but a joke about what the CDC is trying to do about it."
46,41,> I'm not sure if you're just a twat about that stuff. I don't think it's funny.
50,46,"""...This is one of the worst things you can do in your free time. I'd be happy if I did this to my kids, but I'd still be unable to go to the doctor because it isn't a joke."
52,46,You can tell by your post /send your comment:
57,46,A funny joke in general is when someone says that someone is being sexist in order to hurt someone else. A good joke in general is when you get on a motorcycle and you get to ride the bike with your pants. It's a joke when you do it on the road or in the park and people start to feel like they're sexist.
59,46,"In Texas, the AMA has a place. You need to ask the question of why people are getting vaccinated. But I was asked ""Why does this matter?"""
61,46,> I think it's funny because it sounds funny. I'm also a slob.
65,46,"I think this is going to be hilarious. You can't stop seeing people in a mask as a joke, but they can tell you if it's a joke that you want to hear. So, as a doctor, I say ""you can't get a hat for your doctor but you can't get a hat for your doctor."" You'll see people 'put their mask on' and that's a joke, not a joke."
82,46,The only problem I have with this post is that it seems like this is only about the federal government. It’s not really about the AMA. It’s more about the public health issue. It’s about the AMA.
83,46,"Unless it's an AIDS joke, why would you want to wear a mask?"
87,46,"The headline reads as ""I'm wearing a mask outside while vaccinated."" The next part of the headline is ""What I want to clarify is I don't know why I think that the AMA is so successful"""
98,46,... [which is the most recent article about the government](https://www.facedadvice.com/r/virginia/)
46,7,"Its not a joke. The AMA is a joke. It is a joke. It is a joke. It is a joke about the government in general and in particular, if you're looking to save yourself from this disease, you're a joke."
46,8,A joke isn't a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.
46,41,There is no 'right' or'misleading' in AMAs and AMAs are not generally considered 'a joke' in any context.
50,46,"There are many problems with this vaccine. Vaccination does not exist, but it does create problems in the first place."
52,46,"I think this is a joke. People who don't have a proper mask are going to be vaccinated. If they don't have one, they will start going to the doctors or hospitals that have one."
57,46,"The CDC is not legally required to provide vaccines. It's legal because it's not required to deliver vaccines unless you are a doctor or a physician. They are not legally required to give people the vaccine, which is not a joke."
59,46,I was able to get vaccinated in my late 20s because I didn't have a visa. During my life I had to carry a mask that was designed for my age. I was lucky to get vaccinated because my dad was a nurse and I wore the mask and got the vaccine while I was under a hoodie.
61,46,"""Cannot understand the joke, but I am not a doctor, I don't think there's anything wrong with that."
65,46,"I had a very scary time, a lot of things. The doctor who put me in a hat went nuts."
82,46,"People say the AMA is the government's job, and they're doing nothing about it."
83,46,AIDS is a disease that happens when it's not infected. I'm sorry the CDC isn't legally required to prescribe TB vaccines.
87,46,"I think AMAs are more about preventive actions than about protecting the public. I think that the people who are in the audience should be asking questions that they could have the courage to answer, and not just the ""why does it bother you"" part. Is there a way for people to tell people what's right or wrong?"
98,46,"You're getting a lot of stuff wrong here. The CDC has a joke that you get off the mask, but it's not exactly the joke. It has something to do with what's being done or even if it's not in the original joke, it's just a joke."
46,7,"If the AMA is about preventing the spread of HIV/Aids and not about stopping the spread of HIV/AIDS/aids, then that is a joke about the government and a joke about the AMA about the AMA."
46,8,The best part about this post is how I understand it:
46,41,There is a whole bunch of nonsense in there and I'm just saying it isn't funny at all.
50,46,This is an excellent example of what the government can do with public health.
52,46,"[Miracle, the Government's job as a vaccine advocate](http://www.dcc.gov/hpp/Hp/hp/hp/) Vaccines are legal because they can cause fatalities. They are illegal because they can cause fatalities."
57,46,It's the same with jokes. I don't care what the point of a joke is if it's to stop the spread of a virus. Vaccines are not necessary. Unless you are a physician or a doctor. They are not legally required unless you are a physician. They are not legally required unless you are a physician. They are not legally required unless you are a physician. They are not legally required unless you are a physician. They are not legally required unless you are a doctor.
59,46,The AMA and AMA is just a joke that has nothing to do with a joke.
61,46,"In the context of a joke like that, I would just scream that I didn't understand it."
65,46,"if you have the resemblance to a hat, you can get one too - not in the first place. if you don't have the resemblance to a hat, or a hat, you can't be in the second place either."
82,46,It sounds like you're bringing up the government's role in stopping the spread of TB. I don't know what the joke is about but I think the AMA is a good joke.
83,46,"It's a joke. It's a joke because it's funny, but it's not legal. It's just one that makes a good point."
87,46,"The best way to tell that joke is to be the ""remember the joke"" part of the headline. AMAs are just a way of expressing how it's a joke."
98,46,I have a friend who is wearing a mask despite being a doctor and she says it's not funny.
46,7,We were given a joke to get vaccinated from being a doctor because of a CDC policy change. This is a joke that we've all heard a million times. This is something that's been around for years.
46,8,AMAs are the way to go. You're not being honest here. It's a joke.

52,46,"The government is trying to stop HIV from spreading, so the AMA is a joke, not a joke. It's going to be pretty obvious. And it's a joke, not a joke, but it's a joke, because it isn't actually a joke."
57,46,"A good joke is a joke, and some of the best jokes aren't about the joke but about the actual joke. It's not a joke and that's about the dangers of the drug. It's not a joke."
59,46,Vaccines are not a joke.
61,46,I think you're being a dick. I think it's a good idea to just put on a mask.
65,46,"No, it's not a joke."
82,46,It's not a joke. It's a joke.
83,46,If they didn't have to go to the doctor and prescribe a drug they wouldn't have to pay.
87,46,AMAs are not about preventing illness. They are about protecting people and public health.
98,46,"That's a joke. A joke is a joke. A joke is a joke, a joke is a joke. But the idea is to prevent the spread of HIV."
46,7,I am in the United States and this is what makes me happy about my job.
46,8,"""A little less joke then a joke."
46,41,People don't really like the idea of being allowed to do a joke if they want to do so.
50,46,"I am in the right, I need a joke."
52,46,Vaccines are for the prevention of diseases.
57,46,I think the joke is funny.
59,46,"It's a joke. Basically, it's a joke, a joke, a joke."
61,46,Is there anything that is meant to be a joke in the context of the movie?
65,46,This is my first sentence :(
82,46,"The people who like it are a snarky group of people, but they also like the idea of the AMA."

65,46,"As an American I cannot imagine how much of a joke that would be. Rather, it sounds like someone is saying it's a prick because it's a joke. So it's a little more serious than that. But what I'd like to say is: ''I don't want to be a joke because it's too early. I do think it's a joke because it's more about a joke about a joke about a joke about a joke about the CDC and the CDC."
82,46,"AMA: ""A lot of the AMAs aren't jokes. It's not a joke because people think it's about the government. It's a joke. They're just trying to make fun of the government and try to push the problem away. It's a joke, but it is a joke."

46,7,AMA: 'This is a joke. It is a joke because they are based on real information and they are trying to force the AMA on the public'.

57,46,That's a joke. Those jokes are not funny. They're funny because of the fact that they're not a joke about vaccines.
59,46,I thought it was funny because it was a joke about a joke and people were referring to it as a joke and not a joke about the government.

The CDC doesn't want people to wear masks for the purpose of preventing it and they want them to stop them. It's not a joke. Rather, it's a joke about someone who doesn't have AIDS."
