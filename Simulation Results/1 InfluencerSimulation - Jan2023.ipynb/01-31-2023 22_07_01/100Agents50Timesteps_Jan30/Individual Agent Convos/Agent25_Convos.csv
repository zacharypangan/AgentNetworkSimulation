25,15,i'm going to eat my way to the back of a pig and go go see you tomorrow.
25,24,The idea that everyone has the right to wear a mask is a great one. People with a valid reason aren't entitled to wear it.
30,25,This is the best thing to happen to anyone whose kids are being vaccinated if they aren't wearing a mask.
38,25,Wearing a mask helps stop the spread of a virus :(

67,25,Those people do need to wear their masks to show them they care about others. Seeing these people being scared and putting on a mask just won't be enough to stop a disease from spreading.

25,24,It is the best thing to happen to anyone whose kids are being vaccinated if they aren't wearing a mask.
30,25,You've got a message:
38,25,"In the meantime, you should not be able to wear a mask in public. A man who didn't wear a mask a week before the last day of work was going to be able to go home. I don't want to leave. I don't want to be able to go, or get in a position where I can't see his face."
41,25,"It's all about prevention. I'd rather do it than be called superspy, but it has been around a long time."
47,25,I'm in Texas and we have no law against my bare skin from wearing a mask.
50,25,It's called a mask and helmet in some countries. It's a mandatory safety feature for most countries.
52,25,"It's funny you think people are too afraid of things in general that aren't very likely to be fixed. That's true of people whose homes they're in. A friend of mine has a virus that's already in her life. The doctors don't always notice when they see his mask or his eyes unless they are absolutely certain that it's out in the open and he's really scared because he doesn't want to risk his life, even though they may be sick. I think it's really not that stupid to say you should wear a mask"
55,25,I see no reason why I want to wear a mask.
57,25,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. I would go out of my way to show my respect to people who are a total narcissist and will inevitably suffer the same thing.

79,25,We are in a bad place and you've already got a few more days to kill yourself.
83,25,"I'm not sure what a mask is. It's the government's way of saying ""you're gonna have to wear it for a while."" The word that comes up is, ""I have to wear a mask on a run. That's nice of you!"""
86,25,"There are several different kinds of masks out there. I mean, a mask that protects you from virus or a scleroscope and a mask that is intended to protect you from corona is designed to protect you from a virulent Virus and a scleroscope."
25,2,The NSA is inventing a solution to the problem that is currently infected. The solution is to remove a mask and bring a person in.
25,15,My wife has had two serious asthma attacks. The first one took the form of a fever. She wore a mask because it was the only type that survived the infection and that was a combination of two different medications. I didn't want to be in a state where I would be in the ER so I wasn't at home. I think she had a fever and had a rash.
25,24,"If a man doesn't wear a mask a week before the last day of work, and that he's afraid, he's being called superspy."
30,25,There isn't a lot of humor in this.
38,25,I have a very difficult time believing that a woman's right to wear a mask is indicative of what a virus is. The fact that the government doesn't know how to prevent the spread of a virus is indicative of what a virus is. The fact that the government doesn't know how to prevent the spread of a virus is indicative of what a virus is.
41,25,I wouldn't say the government is a superspy. That is a different idiom from what the word Superspy means.
47,25,"It's probably a little obvious from the title. You can wear a mask but I think it's a pretty good idea to have someone to run with with you if you want to run, since they can help protect you."
50,25,I don't think any mask mandate is a bad idea. That's the most stupid thing you can say to a non-expert.
52,25,You're not stupid. They're really vile.
55,25,"op, i was so confused because i read that he wasn't aware he was going to wear a mask."
57,25,I would go out of my way to show my respect to people who are a total narcissist and will inevitably suffer the same thing.
67,25,"You're so stupid that you don't understand how much masks do scream for ""stop the spread of the virus"""
75,25,"That's the reason that pandemics happen. If you're allergic to anything, you go to the hospital, or go to the doctor in the hospital. If you're a pandemic victim, the doctor is a pandemic victim. You don't have a mask. You wear it."
78,25,In my experience the government needs to stop the spread of a virus in order to stop it from spreading.
79,25,"The first part of the question is not whether this is relevant in the context of the 'Canceling' part, but whether the idea is."
83,25,"I just went to my local school and got a mask in my hand. A lot of people want to wear it but I never do. We have to wear a mask. It's a mask because we have to get a full blown antibiotic, and there is no way to vaccinate everyone but I don't think the government really cares about that stuff and it's a scam."
86,25,The most important thing to do is to get tested before being vaccinated. Because it's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.It's a mask. It's a mask. It protects from viruses.
25,2,"I don't know how much the mask thing is, and the context of the article is a bit unclear."
25,15,I have a mask for the bronchitis. Mostly for the bronchitis.
25,24,"Wearing a mask is a great idea, but I think we are arguing that the government is the one that is a spy because it is the only way to stop a virus from spreading."
30,25,"The only thing that really makes this a real issue is the way he describes the concept of a mask: ""Making a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus, or even make it easier to get around it. Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of a virus, or even make it easier to get around it."
38,25,"In order for this CDC to prevent this, we have to wear a protective clothing when the symptoms appear and prevent people from getting infected. Its not ""assailant"" that these people are being abused. And it is not something that is ""assailant"". There is no reason to be in a public place when someone is being sick."
41,25,This is the most fucked up thing I've read in years. I don't even know what they say.
47,25,"If you want to be safe in the public, that’s a great idea."
50,25,>wearing a mask and a helmet to protect you from corona and that everyone would have to wear to go outside for a month or that would allow us to open up the economy again.
52,25,"I don't think there's anything wrong with a mask on a run and then wearing it in public, but that's a pretty big'mock' that doesn't go away until after the next day."
55,25,"i just finished the video and the video was a bit of a jumble of ""people wear masks to prevent illness. They make people feel sneeze or shaved face."""
57,25,It's not a joke. It's a joke.
67,25,"They could not do anything about it. They are simply claiming that in a bid to deter the spread of a disease they would rather the government have a plan to prevent it from spreading. This is a pretty big problem to fix and doesn't seem to be an effective way to address it, they are focusing on a specific issue instead of a single issue."
75,25,I think this is funny because it is.
78,25,"I had to wear a mask to avoid infection. The part that made me want to be on the street was about trying to help people get better. My ex got me an erection and said, ""I need a mask, please don't give me an erection."""
79,25,[This sub ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
83,25,> I think we need more fads. But it's actually pretty easy to give them an incentive to be more protective than the government.
86,25,"I'm not sure what you mean by ""I'm wearing a mask outside while vaccinated because people like you are in my face why does it bother me to the point that you are asking random people why they are doing something that makes them feel safe Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
25,2,The most important thing to do is to get tested before being vaccinated. Because it's part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
25,15,What's the name of the woman who was in a mask? That is not a joke.
25,24,"'The most important thing to do is to get tested before being vaccinated.

30,25,"The only thing that really makes this a real issue is the way he describes the concept of the word ""mask""."
38,25,Yes. This dries up and leaves me a little paranoid.
41,25,The issue is with the government. There are several things that would be discussed.
47,25,">We're in Texas and we have no law against my bare skin from wearing a mask."""
50,25,"What are you talking about? A person without a mask can not be vaccinated. There's no need to be vaccinated, that's their choice."
52,25,"OP: The problem isn't that a person doesn't have a vaccine, but that a person has the ability to prevent any form of pandemic."
55,25,It’s pretty common for people who are afraid of getting hit by a car to work in the USA to avoid getting sneezed or shaved. And that’s a good thing.
57,25,This isn't just a joke. It's an issue. There is a whole section of the internet that says this : [Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wearing_a_maw_splash_from_the_vaccination_resources_item_item_name].
67,25,A lot of people make these kinds of jokes.
75,25,People like you can’t just stop being sick if they aren’t at the hospital.
78,25,Wearing a mask helps to stop the spread of a virus.
79,25,"It seems like some people have already started promoting HIV and HIVV vaccines, and are thinking of getting out of there, in some way. I mean it doesn't seem like the CDC is doing anything about that, but that would be a very 'fuck it' thing. It's about the awareness of what is coming about."
83,25,"My family in finland is a lot of people with a virus. We don't like wearing a mask on their own, but we've been told by the state doctors that wearing a mask is the best thing to do."
86,25,">I’ve been in a TB hospital for two months, and it was actually the first thing that came to mind. It was only a temporary thing, just like any other sort of protective gear. It’s probably not for everyone, but it's not something that's in the realm of possibility in a lot of places."
25,2,"You're not going to be able to put up with a government typhoid, and it would be very annoying if people were vaccinated without their mask. But if you don't you're able to do so without fear of getting hit by a car. And if you're too ill to put up with a TB you're going to tamper with your virus."
25,15,The article says that the government is making attempts to stop the spread of a virus.
25,24,I don't even think you understand why the government is promoting it.
30,25,"CANNOTANSWER: the first thing I do when I go to a doctor is to stop the spread of a virus, and then I get an injection for a virus."
38,25,This post is filled with untruths.
41,25,"I mean, there's a reason for a rapist to not wear a mask. If he wants to wear a mask because he's getting sick and can't get rid of a virus then he doesn't need a mask."
47,25,Is wearing a mask a misstep to help prevent the spread of a virus?
50,25,There isn't even any real definition of vaccine.
52,25,"It's a joke because people who are vaccinated are on a list that would make them not needing to go to the doctor, and not to the doctor who vaccinates them."
55,25,"It is a very effective way to protect against a virus, but people are scared of being attacked and should have their head cut if they were hit, too."
57,25,"I think it's a bit funny that the fucking thing is so controversial on here, because it's a really popular joke."
67,25,I'm a huge fan of your joke.
75,25,I have an epiphany. It's not just a joke.
78,25,There are many problems with being vaccinated. I’ve seen them a few times and my first time I was the cheapest person I knew. It made me feel like I had to wear a mask to avoid infection. It was not funny.
79,25,"[NAME]: ""There is absolutely nothing to be ashamed of in Texas, except that the CDC and the CDC, and the other hospitals are all completely unregulated. They can't help their own system with a way to do things that aren't doing anything."
83,25,What a waste of money. A lot of people don't realize that wearing a mask makes them feel bad.
86,25,Vaccines are pretty common.
25,2,I think you're not being sarcastic. A lot of people don't realize that wearing a mask makes them feel bad. Vaccines are pretty common.
25,15,What the fuck do you think about a mask being part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus?
25,24,It's just a joke. You don't need a mask to have a virus. There's nothing to be ashamed of in Texas.
30,25,"I don't know why anyone would wear a mask, I do not know why people don't wear them. I know how it feels to be infected with something so terrible but I don't know why people do that. Isn't this just a joke?"

You’re very caring and supportive of the people who have been treated and I’m very proud of the people who have been treated."
41,25,What kind of virus is he a rapist?
47,25,"So, you have to wear a mask to prevent the spread of HIV?"
50,25,"[Born in the USA], the government hasn't adopted the latest vaccines, or any other health care legislation that would protect children from the virus, except it does not have to be the gov't."
52,25,"It is also not a joke that the government is trying to make a joke, it is a political move."
55,25,"What do you think about the government's actions? Do you think that if they tried to prevent an outbreak, it would make it easier for them to start treating everyone with a vaccine? It's a legitimate threat, they're not going to take it."
57,25,"The last part of this is a joke. The first part is a joke about the lack of a protection system. You've never actually seen a cyborg on your hand, and I've never actually seen a cyborg on your hand."
67,25,It's actually really easy to think about.
75,25,"I don't like it when people joke about that because it's the opposite of what's common in those other threads. But I do like that people use the phrase ""I have an epiphany"" as it's an expression of what the government is trying to imply."
78,25,"The government is shit. This guy's not a doctor, and his friend is."
79,25,I don't see any reason for people to be ashamed of having a mask in public. This is part of the reasons people wear one. This is not about the government. It is about people having their own way of dressing.
83,25,I don't see how it is a joke. It's a joke. I'm not saying it is not funny. I just don't see it as a joke.
86,25,"Vaccines are pretty common, mainly to help people get healthy."
25,2,"That's not funny, it's just not true."
25,15,"He wrote a post about ""What's the last part of this is a joke. I don't see any reason for people to be ashamed of having a mask in public. This is part of the reasons people wear one. This is not about the government. It is about people having their own way of dressing."
25,24,"I'm a little skeptical of the actual facts, but I have an epiphany."
30,25,"Why don't we all go to the doctor and have a ""masked infection"" at home?"
38,25,What a joke. I would be very mad if I got a virus... I'd say a mask is not in the bill of rights.
41,25,It's a petty joke that's in r/politics.
47,25,"I am not trying to make you look bad, but in other words, I am trying to convince you that my current doctor is a legitimate anti-virus advocate."
50,25,The government has not been able to create a vaccine to prevent this. The gov't is trying to create a vaccine that prevents the spread of the virus.
52,25,"Yes, it's a joke, but I can't help but wonder why people are scared of that sort of thing when they're already infected."
55,25,"CANNOTANSWER: 'The NSA has an obligation to keep everyone safe - not the children and the government itself. I don't believe they have any protection at all. I think they have no protection at all."""
57,25,"I have seen a cyborg a lot of times on the news, and it's a joke. It's pretty blatant and not so much a joke and a little odd."
67,25,Vaccines are not what the government wants. They aren't what the government wants.
75,25,I would love to see an explanation of why this is a joke.
78,25,">The guy I was in on the bus, had to take me to the ER for a treatment because he was not able to find a doctor. I feel like a little harsh. I'm not a doctor, but I work in a hospital and I would go to the doctor to see if anyone was interested in the situation. Vaccines are for life. It's funny because 'A lot of people say ""Wearing a mask can stop the spread of the virus, so it's not just necessary."""
79,25,'When I was a kid I used to wear a mask all the time to avoid infecting other people with the virus.
83,25,"So, a joke is a joke? You are so right, I am not sure what a joke is, but it is a joke."
86,25,It is a really stupid thing to say.
25,2,"I was in the same situation as you. I was in a public hospital where the doctor was trying to get me to visit a friend. The doctor was asked if he was okay, he was refused the test because he didn't wear a mask and was unable to find a doctor. He said he had nothing to do with it. It was a joke."
25,15,"People need to go to the doctor. It's a joke, but it's not a joke."
25,24,">I think we are arguing that the government is the one that is a spy because it is the only way to stop a virus from spreading."""
30,25,"So you're saying they're not going to stop the spread of a virus? People with a face mask wear a mask to show them their lack of social skills. It's not a joke, it's just a joke."
38,25,"Vaccines are for life. It's a very, very basic human right to not be vaccinated."
41,25,It's not a joke. It's a good thing that you're not being jarred. It's not a joke.
47,25,I think this is a good time to go to the doctor without a mask. It may be better to get some more people to talk to the CDC.
50,25,A number of things have come to my mind:
52,25,"That's why the ""I'm a GP. And I've never gotten sick. What do you think is important?"""
55,25,"CANNOTANSWER: ""The NSA has an obligation to keep everyone safe - not the children and the government itself. I don't believe they have any protection at all. I think they have no protection at all."""
57,25,I don't think the joke is hilarious. The CDC has no interest in the cyborg but it sounds like it's a joke if people don't like the word it.
67,25,> Wearing a mask on your birthday will be very easy to fix.
75,25,"It sounds like they're trying to imply that people should have no rights to wear a mask. It sounds like the government is a bad idea. And he was trying to make a joke about it, and the CDC is a good joke about it, because he hasn't had any health issues and he's not a doctor, and that's just a joke."
78,25,"I think it's funny because you need to be vaccinated. You can't say, ""We should not be wearing a mask to prevent people from spreading a virus. This is a bad idea."""
79,25,There's a reason a lot of people in Texas are uncomfortable with wearing a mask.
83,25,"I'm a human being. If you don't care, you don't have to."
86,25,This is what I'm going to put out here.

41,25,"A lot of the arguments around the AMA are fucked up. They don't even mention being able to help with anything, especially if you don't have a licence."
47,25,"The article is called the ""Porn Porn"" and translates the whole thing as ""The CDC's work on preventing TB. It's about the CDC's work on preventing TB."
50,25,"They don't want to use it on kids. They want it to do them a favor and prevent them from becoming infected if they're infected. And they also want to help people, and people should be allowed to choose what they want. Is it only to protect them if they are infected and they're not? Or is it to give people a choice to not be infected?"
52,25,"Yes, it's a joke, but if the point of it is to make a joke it will not work."
55,25,I think you are right. I think the first point is that wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

83,25,I have never thought of a mask as a joke. Especially when someone tries to say it with a big “I don’t care” phrase.
86,25,"A mask that protects you from corona - one that protects from the flu - is used to protect you from corona. A mask that protects you from corona. It's a mask. It protects from viruses. I'm curious what that means by ""I'm wearing a mask outside while vaccinated because people like you are in my face why does it bother me to the point that you are asking random people why they are doing something that makes them feel safe. I don't think anyone would do it if not for the CDC."
25,2,"A bunch of people are calling this a ""commentary joke."""
25,15,"""I think we are arguing that the government is the one that is a spy because it is the only way to stop the spread of a virus."""
25,24,"> I think it's a bit funny that the AMA is so controversial on here, because it's a really popular joke."
30,25,If the CDC were to start doing the same thing I would just wear a mask and get vaccinated. I'm not going to even see a movie about it.
38,25,Vaccines are for life. They are just not necessary - if your employer gives you a mask it will only make you sick if you have the correct vaccinations - not for the sake of public health.
41,25,"You know what I mean, in a joke a lot of people are being jarred about things."
47,25,I think it's interesting how it seems the CDC is claiming to be a legitimate anti-virus advocacy organization in Texas. They are trying to make a joke that the people in Texas don't know enough about TB and can't tell you that the person they're trying to portray is a political activist. They are trying to bring a broader audience to the discussion and they aren't listening to the people themselves.
50,25,"As someone who is a bit of a neocon or anti-vaccine fanatic, there's nothing wrong with wearing a mask. It does, however, protect against many other diseases whose presence has gotten worse over the years."
52,25,What's the difference between a 'joke' and a joke?
55,25,It's a joke because it's easy to put an end to it. It's a joke because it's a joke because it's easy to put an end to it. The government can't help itself in that way.
57,25,Vaccines are legally required for children to get their hands vaccinated.
67,25,I can't believe I'm the only person in this sub.

78,25,"I'm in the UK, so I understand why a lot of people are confused."
79,25,"I'd like to add: I think it would be a good idea to have a ny mask mandate in place, and if it was mandated by the CDC and the other hospitals, to prevent that."
83,25,People are also putting up with this idea of being the only government to make it so. The government is in no position to prevent fapping of people. It's a joke.
86,25,The AMA is about preventing the spread of HIV. I think it's best if people have a better understanding of the disease.
25,2,A lot of people don't realize that wearing a mask makes them feel bad. Vaccines are pretty common. But if you don't you're going to tamper with your virus.
25,15,"If you're a doctor, you're not a doctor. It's not the CDC, but it's a CDC group. Vaccines, not a government agency."
25,24,"My parents were in the UK, so I don't recall ever hearing of this joke."

41,25,I feel like it would have helped us to be a better smug person when that was the case.
47,25,You're going to be a CDC expert in putting out the same info all over again.
50,25,There is no good reason not to use it on kids. They don't need to use it on them. They need to wear a mask to protect them. There is no good reason not to use it on kids.
52,25,"""It's funny you think people are too afraid of things in general that aren't very likely to be fixed. That's true of people whose homes they're in."
55,25,It's a ripoff of the book and I agree with this.

67,25,This sub is a joke.
75,25,"So, why is there a joke being made in AMA?"
78,25,"I'm from the UK, so I understand why a lot of people are confused by this."
79,25,"We're going to go up in Texas to get the CDC, the CDC, the CDC, etc., to make sure that we aren't getting any information about HIV causing people to suffer. People wearing masks as a courtesy is one thing, it’s a great idea."
83,25,"Wearing a mask on a run is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.It's actually a joke. I mean the government has some great policies that do the same thing. Like having to be in a hospital to go get some antibiotics or something. I would not want to wear a mask on my job, and I don't want to wear a mask in public."
86,25,"It's really a shame that so many people are using ""A mask that protects me from viruses"" to justify using ""Vaccines are for life""."
25,2,"So, it's funny to say that that's what's going on here."
25,15,"I am a doctor. I wear a mask every day, not in public or in public."
25,24,"I've always thought the government was a joke, but it's not."
30,25,I think the whole point of wearing a mask is to help people understand social concepts.
38,25,"So what, if I get a hat and my coworker 'helps' me with a virus. He's the one getting the hat."
41,25,"AMA (again, not as long as it's not just the joke)."
47,25,"There's a pretty good chance the CDC is going to be trying to make the CDC look bad by taking down a number of people without masks, and then re-programing their policy to keep people from becoming a dick. This guy just went out of his way to make sure that the CDC doesn't fucking screw it up by telling people to go to the doctor without a mask."
50,25,"[Did you know it's called a ""jail,""?"
52,25,"... and I think if you're going to make jokes about something that's not funny then you might be looking at something else. It's a lot of jokes and jokes, and it's not like they're all joking about things. There's so much going on here that the only thing that doesn't work is a joking joke."

75,25,I have a very hard time believing there is a joke about the AMA.
78,25,"I mean I am a professional and in the UK he's talking about getting vaccinated and there's a definite difference. You can be a professional at a health center without wearing a mask. There are no risks, you'll get sick, you'll need to get tested, and it is not good for your health."
79,25,Having a mask in public isn't the same as a job.

86,25,"I have no idea why this isn't a joke, but it's a great way to explain what the AMA is about. It is an exercise."
25,2,"AMA is a very interesting, interesting, and logical term. It's the AMA where they don't go out of their way to make the CDC look bad and just laugh at a joke - but that is the point of a joke."
25,15,">I am a doctor. I wear a mask every day, not in public or in public."
25,24,"I'm in a hospital right now, I don't think I'm going to be able to wear a hat on a run without a mask. I just want to know why the government is promoting this."
30,25,This is a really bad joke.

41,25,"AMA (again, not as long as it's not just the joke). I'm trying to say that a ""good joke"" about a ""joke"" isn't the best thing to do because it is a public health issue."
47,25,The CDC is not an anti-virus organization. They are an anti-viral advocacy organization.
50,25,I don't have anything to say about it.

55,25,"They've all been through it, and it seems there is no point in using the word ""joke"" to make any statements to make any statements about that."
57,25,I'm not saying it's funny. I'm just saying that if you don't believe the CDC's ban on wearing masks then you're lying. This is a joke.
67,25,"I mean, this sub isn't about how they stop the spread of a virus, and they're about how they keep it from spreading. They're about a disease that they don't want to stop, so they're just talking about it."
75,25,I'm assuming the AMA's title is referring to the fact that people are using it to talk about the pandemic. But the whole thing is a joke and it's just a joke.
78,25,CANNOTANSWER: The headline is funny.
79,25,"I think this is about the safety of people living in public places where they need a mask or they are in a position to avoid HIV. I don't think there's anything wrong with them promoting HIV and HIVV vaccines but it's definitely about'safety' and not about the health of people. I feel like I'm the one who's putting the issue in front of me. I'm not really into politics either, but I think it's a good idea."
83,25,"I think he thinks it's funny as a joke because of the fact that he says it with the ""I don't care"" phrase."

I think people should just don't wear a mask."
79,25,"It’s like, “If you aren’t aware that you have HIV, you’re just going to be infected with HIV.” That’s basically the point of this article. This isn’t just about a ripoff of the book, but about a joke that people are trying to spread."
83,25,The whole thing was about how people feel. And a lot of that was because the government wants to control the spread of a virus that they want to vaccinate.
86,25,I’ve jumped in to this thread wondering what that means.
25,2,"And the AMA is about a joke about the government, not the CDC. The AMA is a book, and the article is a book, which is a bit about the government, and the CDC."

25,24,AMAs aren't a joke.
30,25,">I think it's funny that the movie is about a guy in a cyborg costume, who was allergic to the virus and decided to play with his mask, because he knew that the guy had no idea what to do. I mean, you’re supposed to talk about this all on television..."
38,25,I'm not a doctor. I'm a doctor. I've been vaccinated for the last ten years and I've never seen a sick person. I am a medic so I don't have to wear any vaccinating clothing. It has to be nice and light and comfortable for my family.

83,25,">Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.A few years back a doctor asked if I was okay with putting on a mask. They had a great deal of fun. It was like a ripoff of the book, huh?"
86,25,I think a lot of people are confused about the entire point of the article....
25,2,It is just a joke.
25,15,"The problem is, the AMA is being trolled, and that is where this story is made. The author was clearly referring to the “real-world” and not the “big-time” joke."
25,24,"Is the word ""Joke"" from a joke?"
30,25,"CANNOTANSWER: This is the only thing that really makes this a real issue is the way he describes the concept of the word ""mask""."

75,25,I have a phobia of wearing a mask.
78,25,"I don't think I'm very good at writing these kinds of comments. I'm not saying a lot of people agree with the jokes. I'm saying if you don't like it, you don't want to, and you just don't want to say what they want is the joke you want."

67,25,"I think this is probably the most humorous and honest comment that came out of this thread. I am very sorry, but in all of those comments I was left feeling a bit out of touch and resent the fact that I said the opposite, not that I was joking."
75,25,"I think there's a difference between a ""commentary"" about the AMA and ""your opinion on a joke"""
78,25,What would the AMA be about?
79,25,The article was about the public health system in Texas and how they are trying to keep people from getting sick. I don't think it's appropriate for anyone in Texas to wear a mask.
83,25,"It's kind of like ""The law is very clear that a mask isn't necessary, and it's not necessary at all."" (As of December 10, 2010)"
86,25,"We have to have that kind of coverage. If it's the CDC, we'll have it by the end of September."

75,25,"I mean, I wouldn't even call the whole thing ""a joke"" because I'm more in the middle of pandemics than I am in the middle of. I mean, like it's pretty clear that all these things are a joke, and they can be construed as racist, sexist, and insulting. And I'm not sure if that is true or not."
78,25,"AMAs are just one thing. They are a means to communicate a message to the general public that it's not a joke. They do it for the purpose of telling people how bad it is for a disease. They don't want to make a joke, they want people to know how bad it is, and they want to hear it about the joke."

41,25,"""...but if you really don't care about the book or the movie. 'I'm really sorry about your health problems, but this is a joke, but it's about the government's failure to act on it.''"
47,25,CANNOTANSWER THE AMA TO PRESENT A JOKE?
50,25,"""That’s not a joke."""
52,25,"It's one thing to make people wear a mask because they don't get sick because they have the virus and a mask to protect them and if they don't, the doctor won't get sick if they aren't vaccinated."
55,25,The CIA doesn't have any protection from a virus. I think it's just too common.
57,25,"It's just a joke, it doesn't mean something to the people who make fun of it. It's a joke because it doesn't mean anything to them."
67,25,>[http://www.np.np.gov/reports/public_advice.pdf](http://www.np.np.gov/reports/public_advice.pdf) is about the problem that they are focusing on a specific issue instead of a single issue.

78,25,"This isn't a bad joke, it's a bad joke."
79,25,Then I saw that in the title.
83,25,"I've seen this movie about a dozen times, and I don't care."
86,25,"This is one of the many stories of a person who thought the AMA was about the government. AMA is about how the government is trying to prevent a disease causing illness, and the government is trying to get people to stop it causing it causing it. This was one of the stories I remember reading."
