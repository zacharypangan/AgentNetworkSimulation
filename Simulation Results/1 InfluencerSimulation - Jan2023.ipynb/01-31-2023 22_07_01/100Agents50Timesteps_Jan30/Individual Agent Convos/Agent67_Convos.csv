101,67,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
67,9,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
67,25,Those people do need to wear their masks to show them they care about others. Seeing these people being scared and putting on a mask just won't be enough to stop a disease from spreading.
67,56,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
74,67,This is where I come in first.

80,67,I like wearing a mask to help stop the spread of a virus.

101,67,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
67,9,"I think you know the problem, you should wear a mask. Having a helmet is very important, but having a mask on will actually prevent the spread of a virus."

74,67,">We have more than 1000 vaccines. We have about 50,000. Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
78,67,People wear a mask to stop the spread of the virus.
80,67,"If a clone is available, a person will wear a mask. This is a valid reason to wear a mask, but I doubt it will be effective."
85,67,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
101,67,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
67,9,"I have a bit of a hard time believing that if you are going to wear a mask you will be able to prevent the spread of a virus. I'm not going to say it won't do much, but it will give you a chance to find the most effective way to stop the spread. Unless you want to be in an extreme environment where this type of virus can't happen, you're not going to be able to prevent it."
67,25,"You're so stupid that you don't understand how much masks do scream for ""stop the spread of the virus"""
67,56,"I think you know the problem, you should wear a mask."
74,67,I don't like wearing a mask. I don't like wearing a mask. I'm not sure I understand why it's a bit ironic.
78,67,i can think of a lot of reasons why people should wear a mask and that's because they think people need to have a mask when going on a job or other. i wore a mask to keep the virus from spreading so i was able to be able to wear a mask at my job and not to get sick or have other bad things happen in the workdays to keep the virus from spreading. i wore a mask once and was taken out of the hospital with a virus.
80,67,"People just get fucked when their government gets their face out and they're doing something that can't be done, so they're in that position where they can't tell what a virus is, and they're getting a gpa and you can't be able to do that. The public needs to be more aware, they need to understand the problems that exist between the two parties and they want the government to be aware of it, but they can't have a solution to that problem."
85,67,"I was wondering if someone else might say the same thing, since they're like ""You wear a mask on your birthday, because you can go out in public with a fat lip in and nobody knows i wear a mask on my birthday."""
101,67,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
67,9,"People who are in a position to not know what a virus is, and get a gpa don't know what a virus is."
67,25,"They could not do anything about it. They are simply claiming that in a bid to deter the spread of a disease they would rather the government have a plan to prevent it from spreading. This is a pretty big problem to fix and doesn't seem to be an effective way to address it, they are focusing on a specific issue instead of a single issue."
67,56,">We have more than 1000 vaccines. We have about 50,000."
74,67,I'm an insurance adjuster in the state of Florida and I see people with masks all the time on the roads. The CDC is trying to stop the spread of AIDS and it's been going on since 2006.
78,67,That is a really bad example of misinformation. I'm not sure how you could be able to be able to put a mask on people when they were sick or infected.
80,67,A great piece of health advice ever written about people.
85,67,I'm a big fan of your joke.
101,67,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
67,9,"People are very immature and utterly delusional and if you cant think of anything worse than having your head over your head and then seeing a man in your face with a virus on you, I don't see what they mean."
67,25,A lot of people make these kinds of jokes.
67,56,"'We have more than 1000 vaccines. We have about 50,000."
74,67,"> We have more than 1000 vaccines. We have about 50,000. Wearing a mask does not help in stopping the spread of the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
78,67,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I have a bunch of stories about people who wear a mask at all times of the day, like the ones I used to go to the doctor or go on a drive and they'll tell me why. I'm not sure I'd be able to do it because of my age and I do not have an insurance doc who will work with me for this. Wearing a mask can stop the spread of the virus."
80,67,There's also a whole bunch of stuff you can find online on the Internet called 'You've got a doctor?
85,67,"I don't like wearing a mask, but when I do I wear a mask on my birthday."
101,67,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
67,9,"You might have an idea of what's going on there, and you might not want to go."
67,25,I'm a huge fan of your joke.
67,56,"Yes, it can stop the spread of the virus. The government has done so to deter a lot of these people from getting sick, they are actually doing a good job at that and they need to make sure the people who can t eat or drink it are safe and they can do that, so there's no need to act like they're just trying to fix the problem."
74,67,"That's an ironic joke. I think a lot of people are just being silly. The whole concept of a medical mask is silly, but to a large extent it is silly. People who wear masks are often the ones that actually know what's going on."
78,67,I feel like you are getting it.
80,67,"Vaccines are pretty common, mainly to help the body get healthy. A mask is supposed to protect you but it is designed to not protect against infection. scleroscopes are supposed to protect you but they are designed to not protect against infection. scleroscopes are supposed to protect you but they are designed to not protect against infection."
85,67,I think wearing a mask on your birthday will be very easy to fix.
101,67,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
67,9,"I'm not gonna lie, it's an ironic joke. People who wear a mask do not help the spread of a virus. That is a really bad example of misinformation."
67,25,It's actually really easy to think about.
67,56,"This is a good point, and a great one, that I'd have to disagree with."
74,67,"> I think that in order to stop the spread of a virus, a mask is necessary. Vaccines are not what the government wants. Vaccines are not what the government wants."
78,67,This is really not even a joke.
80,67,I don't like being in public and I don't like being in a public place. But I like to be in public. I don't want to be in a public place and I'm uncomfortable in public.
85,67,I'm pretty sure I see that in a lot of people who say 'I like wearing a mask on my birthday.'
101,67,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
67,9,That was a nice little explanation of the problem and a good point.
67,25,Vaccines are not what the government wants. They aren't what the government wants.
67,56,"> The whole concept of a medical mask is silly, but to a large extent it is silly."
74,67,"I would call it a joke, but because i have been told my job doesn't exist i can't see any reason to do it. The idea is to get a vaccine and let people live in it, and help people. That's not a joke either."
78,67,This is not even a joke.
80,67,I'm going to have to look up the CDC's decision to send me a new mask with the message: People who wear a mask all the time don't realise they are wearing it when running through public places.
85,67,I think the best way to fix a sick fetus is to take one of the top three worst things a person can do on a birthday.
101,67,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
67,9,The best way to fix a sick fetus is to take one of the top three worst things a person can do on a birthday.
67,25,> Wearing a mask on your birthday will be very easy to fix.
67,56,"I cant see the point of my post, but if they are telling the truth. There is no need to act like it isn't. The real problem is that the people we care about have done the right thing. But I don't see how anyone could ever stop them from spreading the virus. If you want to get vaccines, do it. You don't need a mask, and your body will be sick."
74,67,I wouldn't call it a joke because you're an insurance adjuster.
78,67,This isn't even a joke.
80,67,"I have a friend who used to wear a mask to prevent HIV and I had one of them that I could actually wear to work because she knew it wasn't appropriate for her situation. Fortunately she had been given a job and she didn't have to wear a mask because of her HIV. I can see where people would be in a worse position if she did it, or if she was in a better position to help."
85,67,"It's called a ""police-shaming"" sub. It's very useful to note that people who wear a mask all the time don't realise they are wearing it when running through public places."
101,67,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
67,9,A Vaccine is not a joke? You can't be in an extreme environment with a virus there. You can't be in an extreme environment and you can't be in an extreme environment.
67,25,> Wearing a mask on my birthday will be very easy to fix.
67,56,"> The whole concept of a medical mask is silly, but to a large extent it is silly."
74,67,There is no reason for a mask to be the best medicine in the world. If it were me I would never want to be vaccinated and it would not be a joke.
78,67,"Wearing a mask to stop the spread of a virus. I'm not a doctor, but I'm a doctor in a hospital, and I do have a mask, and my employer would give me a different mask than I am given. It's very common. I'm going on that AMA with the doctor, who will be presenting the results to a panel of doctors in an effort to help the people that were tested to get HIV (I was on a bus with a hammer!), but I think a joke."
80,67,>People who wear a mask all the time don't realise they are wearing it when running through public places. I like to make it a joke because I've done it with everyone I meet on the internet.

67,25,I can't believe I'm the only person in this sub.
67,56,Why is it silly? Why are people willing to pay for it?
74,67,You're a very immature person. If you were my employer I'd say you have a better chance.
78,67,"Honestly, I don't really get why people wear them when sick, and if they do get sick they might not wear them. I have a few issues, but when I'm sick / sick I don't think I can wear a mask. If it doesn't stop the virus, I have no problem with it."
80,67,The CDC wants to keep people from buying and selling public health kits and vaccines. There's not much to this.
85,67,I would be embarrassed to say that this sub hasn't existed. It's kind of like this.
101,67,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
67,9,"It's been written by someone that is not involved with public health. It's not very good at that. Is there a good way to prevent a virus? If so, it's better to just avoid it and stick to a good one."
67,25,This sub is a joke.
67,56,"Because it is ridiculous. You know, the world would be better without it. You could get caught with a bunch of the same people wearing masks for nothing. People would do anything, and their minds would become a lot more comfortable putting a mask on for fear of getting sick. They'd go to a hospital and get sick if they got sick if they tried."
74,67,Vaccines are a necessary part of the vaccines used to stop the spread of AIDS.
78,67,"""Well, I don't really get why people wear them when sick, and if they do get sick they might not wear them. I have a few issues, but when I'm sick / sick I don't think I can wear a mask. If it doesn't stop the virus, I have no problem with it."
80,67,">I'm not just saying we need to stop wearing masks, but that this problem is going to be tackled."
85,67,I don't see how the people being made to feel compelled to do anything but do what they do in the context of a fetus. I think this is part of why we need to take them away from our health and not ourselves.
101,67,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
67,9,"The most important nefarious message is “I’m not going to get sick, or if you want to get sick, I can’t wear a mask. If you want to get sick, I’ll come home and clean you, if I’m not, and you need me to make you sick.” I’ll put the mask on and say “Wait...Wait....”"
67,25,It's a bit of a hoax. It's a lot like what we've been doing so far.
67,56,It's not a joke at all. It's a joke because people don't realize they have a medical mask and they want to do it to prevent people from getting sick.
74,67,"They don't wear masks, they have masks to prevent the spread of the disease and stop it from spreading."
78,67,"People wearing masks to prevent spread of viruses are a bad thing, not to mention that the fact that they're not being tested against virus-infecting people is a good thing."
80,67,"My parents have a medically weakened tinnitus, but I'm afraid my parents wouldn't have done it."

67,9,"Well the CDC doesn't want to make people feel compelled to do anything, and it is a joke."
67,25,"I mean, this sub isn't about how they stop the spread of a virus, and they're about how they keep it from spreading. They're about a disease that they don't want to stop, so they're just talking about it."
67,56,The entire sub is a joke.
74,67,Vaccination is a combination of medication and therapy to help keep people from dying and getting sick. You get a medical mask on and a mask in your eyes. When you bleed out of a mask you can get a mask in your head to prevent future infections.
78,67,"[Hey, I feel like I blew my mind a little bit on this topic today!](http://np.np.gov/reports/reports/public_advice.pdf)"
80,67,"I can't believe people are asking for a joke and they don't seem to understand it is a joke - I've heard this before from a friend, so I understand. Is that why people are afraid of the government doing it if they don't care? I mean I know the answer to your question, I've gotten a lot of reassurances."
85,67,"if someone tells you to stop wearing a mask on your birthday, then yes, you're doing it right."

74,67,I don't think this is a joke.
78,67,Is this a joke or something?
80,67,I like to make it a joke and I've done it with everyone I meet on the internet.
85,67,>Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
101,67,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
67,9,I can't help but feel compelled to be sick. I'm just saying that because of all the comments about how people are so mad about it.
67,25,The CDC blew me away with this. [Darryl](http://www.np.np.gov/reports/reports/public_advice.pdf)
67,56,"It's not a joke, it's a point of reference, and it's a good one."
74,67,A little about the CDC - what are the CDC's vaccines?
78,67,"I thought the CIA would be a joke for a second. If I were you I'd know why they would ain't going to test me on vaccines. If I was going to test someone, but I still didn't, I wouldn't want to."
80,67,It's not just a joke. It's a joke about how the government doesn't do anything besides putting on a mask to prevent a virus.
85,67,I don’t know about a lot of people that are infected but who do? People have to be fucking miserable for a lot of reasons and not fucking be infected for the rest of their lives.
101,67,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
67,9,"I'm just saying that because of all the comments about how people are so mad about it.

It's not just a joke,"
67,25,It's a joke. It's a point of reference.
67,56,So this is a joke.
74,67,"What a joke. It's so obvious in the context of what's been going on. As far as I know, I've never heard of an AIDS vaccine. But it's very difficult to prove that it actually works, it's pretty obvious from what people have said that the treatment for AIDS is not necessarily the best option, it's just that if you use one for multiple people, you're not doing it in the wrong place."
78,67,"I mean, I think the whole point of wearing a mask to prevent the spread of a virus is, to stop the spread of a virus. It doesn't sound like a joke, but it's inappropriate. I feel like I am being kind of harsh."
80,67,"This is a joke. The CDC is not doing anything about it. They are attempting to rip the government off, because they have nothing to do with it."
85,67,I think I will look for more than just a few people to post to this sub.
101,67,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
67,9,"People if you're a medical doctor have the ability to know what a CDC vaccine is. However, it doesn't work if you're infected. If you're not getting it then you're probably not a very good doctor."
67,25,"This is a joke. Trying to rip the government off, because they have nothing to do with it. Is it a joke? Because I am going to take your comment and post it."
67,56,The government blew me away with this.
74,67,">It's pretty clear from the title that they are trying to prevent the spread of a virus, but they need to change the name so it makes people feel better. I love to wear my masks because I hate it."
78,67,I'm not joking here.
80,67,Why is this joke going to be downvoted?
85,67,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
101,67,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
67,9,I think it’s just a nice idea of how the government’s shills have got the message that they have nothing to do with the world. It seems very likely they could find some way to keep a person safe.
67,25,"I see that the jokes on this subreddit aren't about it, they're about how to fix the problem. Having to find a way to do it is just too much of a burden. Especially if it is going to make people uncomfortable. The problem is that they don't know what a virus is. So it's not like this is a joke. It's just a point of reference."
67,56,It's not a joke at all. It's a joke because people don't realize they have a medical mask and they want to do it to prevent people from getting sick. People would go to a hospital and get sick if they tried.
74,67,It's a joke. Vaccination is a combination of medication and therapy to help stop the spread of the virus.
78,67,"CANNOTANSWER: I have a bunch of stories about people who wear a mask when sick, and if they do get sick they might not wear them. I have a few issues, but when I'm sick / sick I don't think I can wear a mask. If it doesn't stop the virus, I have no problem with it. I feel like I am being kind of harsh."
80,67,"The AMA is misleading, because there is nothing there. It’s not a joke. This is a joke."
85,67,"This is a ridiculous joke. I would imagine if people thought it was a ripoff of the book, he would have never seen it. There's a lot of sexist stuff in here, but nobody actually makes jokes about it. A friend of mine said to me I did not wear a mask because I had a phobia, and I didn't say a damn thing about it."
101,67,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
67,9,You're describing some of the most offensive jokes in the world.

67,56,"I think this isn't a joke, but I'm saying if I'm going to have to laugh then I'm going to do it anyway because I can't get sick because I don't get sick from a medical mask."
74,67,Isn't that a joke?
78,67,The ad is very good in the past - but I've seen some awful people talk about it again.
80,67,"It's a joke about the government and scleroscopes being 'too dangerous' and ""too dangerous"" for everyone, and they are a joke about a government who wants to stop people from buying and selling vaccines and hats. 'They aren't legally required to prohibit people from buying and selling public health kits and vaccines. There is nothing to this."
85,67,It's actually a joke that's about a man who threw himself in a pool of water.
101,67,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
67,9,'Cannot help but feel compelled to be sick. I'm just saying that because of all the comments about how people are so mad about it.'
67,25,I've written for a few other subs.
67,56,This is why a mask is a joke.
74,67,No. This is not a joke. This is a joke.
78,67,"Getting tested for HIV can be a serious health issue, and you're not wrong."
80,67,They're also supposed to protect you from being infected.
85,67,You're pretty sure that I see that in a lot of people who say 'I like wearing a mask on my birthday.'
101,67,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
67,9,"I don't think there's a big difference between wearing a mask and having a health scare. I think there's an extreme and serious problem going on in the US, in this country, and many people have a very sensitive attitude toward the government, and it isn't just the US, there's a very very bad reason to not wear a mask, in my opinion."
67,25,"Well, that's the point, you're being a bit harsh and have a really bad time reading the AMA. There's no point in making such a joke about a situation or being a joke. The AMA is misleading, because there is nothing there. It's just a joke."
67,56,'What do you think of the government in your position? I don't see why it's a joke.'
74,67,Vaccines are not what the government wants. It is a joke. I think it's not a joke.
78,67,What do you think if you are not a doctor or an opportunist? Are you saying that wearing a mask to prevent the spread of AIDS is a bad idea?
80,67,"> 'I don't like being in public and I don't like being in a public place. But I don't want to be in a public place and I'm uncomfortable in public."","
85,67,">Why doesn't your friend of a friend have a phobia, and he could tell you what he thought of it. He said it was a joke, and he didn't want to rip off anything he thought of."
101,67,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
67,9,CDC has actually done a lot of research into this subject and has found that people aren't being honest about it.
67,25,This is a good one.
67,56,"""Moms are a joke because people don't realize they have a medical mask and they want to do it to prevent people from getting sick."""
74,67,I think the whole thing is an attempt to make fun of the government. The whole thing is a joke. People who wear masks are often the ones that actually know what's going on.
78,67,My friend and I have the same story about him and his daughter.
80,67,"You are right. A mask is supposed to protect you, but it is not designed to protect you. I think people need to see a doctor to help them understand what they need. The government is not doing anything about it."

67,25,"CANNOTANSWER DISCLAIMS: ""Is that why people are afraid of the government doing it if they don't care?"""
67,56,"Because I'm not a doctor and I've been in the AMA for three years, I can tell you this is not a joke."
74,67,"A good joke is the most offensive word. If it’s really that obnoxious and mean, I’ll say it. Vaccines are the best option to get people who don’t have AIDS. They are not the best choice to get them. They are not what the government wants."
78,67,It's an AMA because it's an anti-virus joke and it's about saving the world.
80,67,"I mean, I'm sure the government is doing everything it is doing. I mean, there's no reason to do it."
85,67,"""My friend threw himself in the pool of water. We don't want to talk about it at all."""
101,67,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
67,9,It is a joke based on a book and is a good one for an honest discussion of the topic. It is a good one because the AMA has an underlying message.
67,25,"I think this is probably the most humorous and honest comment that came out of this thread. I am very sorry, but in all of those comments I was left feeling a bit out of touch and resent the fact that I said the opposite, not that I was joking."
67,56,"As a side note, it seems like you have a lot more information in this sub - i.e., the doctor in your comments is not doing an AMA. You are not being funny. You are simply joking."
74,67,"The whole issue is about what is best for the people, not the government. I don't think that's a joke, but I'm not a big fan of this guy."
78,67,"I'm not a doctor, and I don't want people to be sick if the person that was vaccinated is not a doctor."
80,67,It's not a joke. It's a joke. And not about the government or what it's trying to control. And they need to cut the number of people who are willing to wear it to avoid the spread of an infection. It's a joke.
85,67,"I am so sorry this is not going to be an unbiased, honest discussion. Thank you for expressing a very important point. It is very important to have people willing to listen."
101,67,"Wearing masks does not help in stopping the virus, it's useless and I hate it."
67,9,"It’s about how people... are a bit immature and utterly delusional and if you’re not an expert, you’re not a doctor. You can do a lot of other things to make people feel compelled to do, but you can’t stop everyone from doing shit on the government, and people should be honest about their opinions on the issue."

67,56,It's a joke because it's a joke. The government is a joke.
74,67,Vaccines are not a joke. A joke is a joke because the idea of a joke is a joke. The idea of a joke is a joke.
78,67,Is it possible that the CDC is trying to protect people from getting the vaccine without testing them?

67,25,>[http://www.np.np.gov/reports/public_advice.pdf](http://www.np.np.gov/reports/public_advice.pdf) is about the problem that they are focusing on a specific issue instead of a single issue.
67,56,">The whole concept of a medical mask is silly, but to a large extent it is silly. It's a joke because people don't realize they have a medical mask and they want to do it to prevent people from getting sick."
74,67,"In some places, I am in the US and there are a lot of sarcastic jokes from sarcastics like ""Vaccines are a necessary part of the vaccines used to stop the spread of a virus. They are not what the government wants."" (http://www.nhsw.gov/vaccy/2013/01/dlmav_doh_o_u_nsf/)"
78,67,I'm not sure how to use a mask in a workplace to prevent a spread of a virus.
80,67,Are you saying that this is a joke? Because you don't understand it.
85,67,">I think it’s better to do this than any other situation. I’m afraid this is something that everyone knows that we should be concerned with."","
