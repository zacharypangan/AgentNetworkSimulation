92,3,You don't trust the vaccine. You have no respect for the citizens of that county. You don't trust it.
92,21,"I know what you mean. But why would you give someone that medically needed a mask, a medical mask, and a regular bath when you return home from work?"
92,28,I don't know much about the current vaccine or its effects.
92,29,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
92,40,"So... your point is that you need a vaccine, and that you have to have a sanitizer, so the patients should get it."
92,41,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
92,43,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
92,45,I don't believe the mask mandate is the only one required by law for those with HIV. So I don't believe that it's the only one required by law.
92,49,I am so sorry mark but I don t trust this vaccine i understand your concern for the residents of erie county i obey the mask mandate wash and sterilize my hands when returning home from work and elsewhere

92,52,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
92,57,This is a really good joke. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
92,59,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
92,61,The first time I see this link I think I've heard this in action.

92,77,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
92,83,"I know what you mean! When we get a new home we have to remove all our masks and scrub our hands with them. You need to have an MRI, a washcloth and a plastic bag, a mask and a pyjamas."
92,84,"I know that s a good idea to use the shield to avoid the spread of a virus in your life. However, in most places there are a variety of vaccines, the mask mandate isn t an ideal way to disinfect hands after you leave work, so this one is pretty useless."
92,88,"I have been there myself, I had no idea I had to get it, and I don't understand why I couldn't do that if I was sick if i was a tourist."
92,3,This is a great joke.
92,21,Because the government is trying to make vaccines illegal in a way that causes harm to other people. The CDC wants the public to be more concerned about health and safety if it is implemented. That s how it works.
92,28,I think you need to read /r/MilkGuide/RedditWomen.
92,29,I like that your message is part of the government's role as a protector of people and health. It's a good one but there is something going on with it.
92,40,It seems a bit ironic that people who have the right to a mask will always think that a vaccinated person is the best person on Earth.
92,41,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
92,43,"I have a medical history that I can relate to: ""I have to clean my hands every day from a day to day basis. I do not care for my body. I don't care for my husband who is healthy. He does not care about my family and I have to help my wife. I do not care about his mother's health. I care about my husband. I care about the best interests of my children."""
92,45,"I had a friend who had a virus that made him sick. She tried to get her mask removed and he asked the doctor to stop, but she couldn't because she couldn't find it and he thought it was sick. He took a MRI, made a diagnosis, had a test, and asked for it to come back and he was not given one."
92,49,"It doesn't annoy me that some people do not realize that ""Sterilizing hands when returning from work"" is part of the vaccination mandate, but it does remind people that ""Standardizing hands when returning home from work"" is part of the vaccination mandate, but it is not mandatory to sterilize your hands after leaving work."
92,51,Yes. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
92,52,This is not a joke.
92,57,A mask mandate is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
92,59,"This isn't just a joke about a government policy for preventing the spread of HIV. You're making a joke about the federal government's inability to stop the spread of a virus. It's a joke about how a government policy is allowing people to ""swipe"" their hands on the government's hands after going to work. Using a vaccine in a way that would prevent the spread of a virus is not a joke about a government policy."
92,61,"i've been there myself, I had no idea I had to get it, and I don't understand why I couldn't do that if I was sick if i was a tourist."

92,77,"Unless you're sick for a bit, you can't use a mask, because you don't trust the government. You have no respect for the citizens of the state. You don't trust the vaccine."
92,83,"I am so sorry mark but I don't trust the vaccine. You have no respect for the citizens of that county. You don't trust it. But why would you give someone that medically needed a mask, a medical mask, and a regular bath when you return home from work? I don't believe the mask mandate is the only one required by law for those with HIV. So I don't believe that it's the only one required by law."
92,84,[This is a really good joke. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.

92,40,"I am not a lawyer, I am a person, and a doctor, and I do not have a medical history to explain. I am not a doctor or a health professional, but I am a person who was told by a doctor that in an attempt to prevent an outbreak of the disease and to stop them from getting it, the CDC made a policy to make it illegal, but I did not think this was a joke."
92,41,"I was not aware of this before, but I was not aware of this policy. The idea that they require you to sterilize your hands on your own is inferred from the facts that the government has made it illegal for the public to do so."
92,43,There is a law that prevents people from wearing a mask on their return from work.
92,45,Why are you ignoring this? The federal government is attempting to make vaccinations illegal and has no real recourse for them. The government is also doing it to prevent the spread of HIV. This is not a joke. It's a joke because it's not a joke.
92,49,"There is a lot of misunderstanding here. The mandate of the vaccine is to prevent infections by preventing ebola. And it doesn't mean they need a mask to prevent them from getting sick. But when it comes to the CDC, the government is essentially going to make vaccines illegal if they don't do it."
92,51,"If it were a joke a government would simply call it a ""mask mandate""."
92,52,"Yes, this is a joke. You have to be a doctor, not a pharmacist."
92,57,"It doesn't annoy me that some people do not realize that ""Sterilizing hands when returning from work"" is part of the vaccination mandate, but it does remind people that ""Sterilizing hands when returning home from work"" is part of the vaccination mandate, but it is not mandatory to sterilize your hands after leaving work."
92,59,You're so sorry Mark.
92,61,"I'm a very vaccinated person, and I don't see a problem with having to vaccinate myself. Using the mask is part of the vaccine mandate. It isn't required in the US, but it is absolutely necessary. In many cases it's not necessary and has absolutely nothing to do with it, as they are not required in the US to do so. The government has no right to vaccinate people. I've heard of people who use a mask as part of the vaccine mandate. The other side of the joke is the fact that when"
92,72,This is the government trying to make vaccines illegal in a way that causes harm to other people. The CDC wants the public to be more concerned about health and safety if it is implemented.
92,77,"As a former medic who worked in public health and a doctor who travelled to Europe to help infected people, I can confirm this: You’ve already received a letter from your doctor saying that you don’t want to have a health care provider if you have an HIV infection. You may want to talk to your doctor about this to ensure that you get a proper diagnosis, or even better. You should not have to use your health care provider to prevent the spread of a virus."
92,83,">I have a medical history that I can relate to: ""I have to clean my hands every day from a day to day basis. I do not care for my body. I don't care for my husband who is healthy. He does not care about my family and I have to help my wife. I do not care about his mother's health. I care about the best interests of my children."""
92,84,A medical mask mandate is a requirement for people with HIV who want to know how to use a vaccinated hand.

92,29,"...and then the CDC tells me the law was made against people who were vaccinated to prevent people from getting HIV. That it is illegal to sterilize their hands, which would probably cause more harm than good. You're an idiot for not knowing anything about the vaccine mandate. The other side of the joke is the fact that the CDC has no recourse for them, and the government is trying to make vaccines illegal, so that a public health professional can be informed on the health risks of the vaccine."
92,40,It's a joke. It's not a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke.
92,41,"Vaccines are a very obnoxious, ridiculous, dangerous drug. I don't think that the public should have to do anything except put on a mask. I'm not saying that they are necessary."
92,43,Vaccination is not a good policy. It’s a fucking joke.

92,51,"I have no idea why the CDC is calling this a joke, but the fact that they have to sterilize people is the joke that would make it even more ridiculous. The government does not want to vaccinate people who don't have a medical history, and is trying to push the government to make it illegal. They are saying ""I have to be a doctor, not a pharmacist."" 'Your doctor is a doctor, not a doctor,"" is not a joke. I can tell you that you are a doctor who also wanted to vaccinate other people."

I feel like I've been put into a position where it's not necessary at all. So, I do not think the situation is a joke. I'd like to see you do what your husband does. But, I also don't think it's a joke that you do."
92,61,"I'm a doctor, so I can't say that I can't understand why people are so concerned about the situation. My experience is that there are many different types of vaccinated individuals that are not vaccinated themselves and they are likely to be unaware of this information that is being released to them, but there are very few who do. I guess I'm a little confused - what the heck are they talking about? I feel the need to be more informed when I think of vaccines, and there are also a lot of people who are aware of them, and are"

92,88,They are trying to protect themselves. But it is the CDC and government's decision.
92,3,The CDC is trying to make vaccines illegal.
92,21,"The article is about what vaccines can prevent infections, not the health risks."
92,28,It's not a joke. Vaccines are not a good policy.
92,29,"I don't understand why you're getting downvoted here, but he has a valid point about a joke."
92,40,"Vaccines are a very obnoxious, ridiculous, dangerous drug. I don't think they should be illegal. They should be voluntary."
92,41,"I'm a doctor. I'm in my 30s, and I'm doing great, and I'm so happy that the government is not pushing this ridiculous policy."

92,45,"They want to make it illegal, but don't say that they do. They want the government to tell us what they want to do based on how you think. It's a joke, but it's a joke."
92,49,Vaccines are not illegal in most places. CDC does not want to make them illegal.
92,51,"The government will not allow you to become a doctor, or get a license, nor do you have any rights or rights to be a doctor."
92,52,"So, here's a funny quote to make:"

92,88,"I don't know what a joke is, but you could say it's a joke."
92,3,"You are a funny guy, Mark. You don't understand the joke."
92,21,There are a lot of people out there who don't trust vaccinations and who want to protect themselves and their families from disease.
92,28,You're a doctor.
92,29,This is a very sensitive situation and you can't be convinced that the CDC is trying to make them illegal.
92,40,"What's more, this is the guy who is trying to make vaccines illegal."
92,41,"Vaccines are a very obnoxious, ridiculous, dangerous drug. They are not illegal. They are not legal. And they are not required. The CDC is trying to make vaccines illegal. The article is about what vaccines can prevent infections, not the health risks."

92,49,"I've heard that if the CDC sucks it'll be a very serious problem for us Americans. It was a joke at first, and it was a joke at the time, and it's not."
92,51,"I'm not a doctor, but I want a doctor that is educated about vaccines and he's not a doctor. The government wants them illegally, but the idea of getting a doctor is the one you're trying to convince yourself of. Vaccines are illegal and the CDC is trying to make it illegal."
92,52,Are you aware of what the CDC wants to make out of the article?
92,57,I don't believe you can be bothered by the jokes in this sub. It's really not a joke. Vaccines are dangerous. They are not necessary. They are a very dangerous drug.

92,45,"Because vaccines are dangerous, dangerous, dangerous. And they are illegal. They are not required. They are legal."
92,49,"If there were any actual medical reasons that were a joke, then I'd probably have a problem with them. That's the point. I am not sure if the law makes sense for a doctor to make that joke a joke, but it's an absurd one, especially since they're all very specific things."
92,51,"This is just a joke, and I know people who use it to get sick. That is all, except that there is no govt in their country."
92,52,I'm not sure why people are concerned. I'm a doctor. And I'm in my late 20s.

92,61,"I think there is a lot of conflict over the use of vaccines, but I just don't think it's a joke. You're a doctor, and aren't a doctor."
92,72,Vaccines are illegal and the CDC is trying to make it illegal.
92,77,Are you still able to call the CDC and explain what they're trying to make? Because I don't think they are going to be able to say any of this at this point.
92,83,"You are going to have to leave the hospital. The next time I visit, I will bring you your hand vaccinated."
92,84,This is a joke. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the federal government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
92,88,Vaccines are not necessary in most places. They are illegal.
92,3,Why is it a joke?
92,21,"It's a joke, I think. It's also the point of the joke, because in this case the ""public health""'s 'care is ''protection'''."
92,28,"I've gotten some serious medical issues and I've only had two, but I think the new law is just trying to keep people from using vaccines. It seems like it's being pushed by the government, not the CDC, in the last few years."
92,29,"He is calling them ""a joke"" (and maybe a joke) that is sarcastic. It doesn't really make sense to have a government trying to stop the spread of a disease by being ""inconvenient"" to a person who is a doctor."
92,40,Is this a joke? Because I don't know about the law.
92,41,"The article is about what vaccines can prevent infections, not the health risks."
92,43,"Vaccines aren't illegal in most places, and that they aren't required. They are not legal. They are legal. Because vaccines are dangerous, dangerous, dangerous. And they aren't required. They are legal."
92,45,"Because vaccinations are dangerous, dangerous, dangerous. And they are not required. They are legal."
92,49,"There is no way that any of those people are gonna see the law. If they get sick and aren't able to come and see a doctor to explain the law, it isn't really going to work."
92,51,And it is all about having a doctor's license and the right to vaccinate a person to prevent infections.
92,52,"That's a very stupid thing to say, and the worst part is that you have to rely on your gf for a mask."
92,57,It's not a joke. Vaccines are legal. Because vaccines are dangerous. They are not necessary. They are a very dangerous drug. They are a very dangerous drug.
92,59,"That's the joke, the joke isn't actually a joke. The joke is ""You don't want to see your hand vaccinated, or get some help getting it fixed. I feel like I've been put into a position where it's not necessary at all."""

92,88,"It's a slang term for a joke, but I don't think anyone would even use that."
92,3,"Vaccines are not illegal, as you say, because they are dangerous, dangerous, dangerous and have the potential to cause fatalities. Vaccines are not legal unless you are a physician."
92,21,"What makes you think that vaccines are illegal is that they're illegal. In other words, the CDC wants the public to be more concerned about health and safety if it's implemented."
92,28,He's being sarcastic. I'd get an answer that's not a joke.
92,29,"People are a little confused. A joke? Yes, a joke. A joke. A joke. A joke. A joke. A joke. A joke. A joke. A joke. A joke. A joke. A joke. A joke. A joke."
92,40,This guy is trying to make vaccines illegal.
92,41,You are going to end up in an argument that the CDC doesn't have a legitimate right to prevent infections by not having a medical license. This is something that's been going on for quite a while.
92,43,"As someone who has not been to the CDC, I can confirm that a lot of people have heard a good joke about the safety of the CDC, but that it is not legal. I'm sure people would think that the new law was a joke, but it's also not legal. I've just been called out on it and am sorry to say that."
92,45,"I'm a doctor, so I'm a good doctor."
92,49,"The first part of the joke that comes up is that ""...We are not legal. and they are not required. They are legal. Because vaccines are dangerous, dangerous, dangerous. And they are not required. They are legal."""
92,51,The only other comment I've seen is [NAME].
92,52,A CDC employee isn't gonna get any help. I've got two problems and have no idea how to get a free and unharmed vaccination for my hands.
92,57,">I've been working in public health for two years and I don’t want to go out every day without wearing a mask. I would like to see your hand vaccinated, or get some help getting it fixed. I don’t want to be a doctor, but I can’t help you, Mark. Vaccines are legal. Because vaccines are dangerous, dangerous, dangerous. And they are not required. They are legal. Because vaccines are dangerous, dangerous, dangerous. And they are legal."
92,59,"""We're not required in most places. They are illegal. Why is it a joke? It's also the point of the joke, because in this case the ""public health""'s 'care is ''protection''''. I've gotten some serious medical issues and I've only had two, but I think the new law is just trying to keep people from using vaccines."
92,61,The joke was thrown in by Mark for not focusing on being a doctor.
92,72,"I'm not going to lie, I'm not saying it is illegal, but I am saying that it's illegal."
92,77,I'm a doctor in my early 20s and have always had to use a mask. I have never felt unsafe.
92,83,"I have to ask this question: Why don't you come to the hospital at 7? It's not safe, so I just want to ask what it is about the situation."
92,84,It's very sad that these things happen in a CDC-led government that wants people not to have to deal with what you are saying.
92,88,What a silly joke! The government is not allowed to stop people from using these products because of some government policy. It's just a joke.
92,3,I can't understand why people have been calling out the CDC for what they want to make a joke about.
92,21,"""...We are not legal. and they are not required. They are legal. Because vaccines are dangerous, dangerous, dangerous. And they are not required. They are legal. Because vaccines are dangerous, dangerous, dangerous. And they are not required. They are legal. Because vaccines are dangerous, dangerous, dangerous. And they are legal."
92,28,"I'm not saying the CDC is not required to give vaccines to people with a medical license, but I am saying that the mandate isn't legally allowed."
92,29,Are there any other jokes you would find interesting?
92,40,CDC: I don't have a vaccine.
92,41,It's not about the vaccines. It's about their health. They can't prevent the spread of a virus if they want to get it.
92,43,"It seems like it's getting more and more prevalent in American culture, as the population goes on to do things like take precautions to protect themselves. People can't eat with your hands or wash your hands at work, and they're sick. They're not healthy for their bodies, and they are not safe for them."
92,45,There are a lot of people who aren't doctors.
92,49,"Yes, there is a difference between a joke and a joke. In one way or another, a joke is a joke."
92,51,"I don't want people to be sick and sick, but I would like to know about my options for getting a free and unharmed vaccine for my hands."
92,52,A CDC employee isn't going to get any help.
92,57,A friend of mine had a similar story for a while and it ended up with a terrible flu rash. She said that her body was a little scared of me and was frightened for two years and didn't want to do anything about it. Then she heard me asking him to stop fucking. It was horrible.
92,59,"What is this law? Do you think it is going to be a joke in a lot of states, or are there local governments where it would be illegal to allow people to wear a mask without a valid license?"
92,61,"Vaccines are legal. Because vaccines are dangerous, dangerous, dangerous. And they are legal."
92,72,"I would go see a doctor or take a vaccination if I were you. I'd probably be very surprised if it's a legal law to do so. It's not illegal but it's not really a joke, and this is not going to change anything."
92,77,"Because vaccines are dangerous, dangerous, dangerous. And they are legal. Because vaccines are dangerous, dangerous, dangerous. And they are not required. In other words, the CDC wants the public to be more concerned about health and safety if it's implemented."
92,83,"I was in a similar situation to mark, and he said he had been sick in the past. It was a joke that the government was putting up with."
92,84,"I'm not going to lie. I'm not saying that they are not legal, and they aren't required. But the federal government is trying to make vaccines illegal. Vaccines are not legal because they are dangerous, dangerous, dangerous and have the potential to cause fatalities. Vaccines are not legal unless you are a physician. What makes you think that vaccines are illegal is that they are legal. The CDC wants the public to be more concerned about health and safety if it's implemented."
92,88,>I do not care about my body. I don't care about my family and I have to help my wife. I care about the best interests of my children.
92,3,What's a joke?
92,21,"What a joke, because it makes you think a joke is a joke?"
92,28,The government is trying to make vaccines illegal.
92,29,"There's a real reason that the CDC hasn't legalized the medical vaccine, unless the government is trying to make them illegal."
92,40,>Another joke that the government was putting up with. I don't care about my body. I don't care about my family and I have to help my wife. I care about the best interests of my children.
92,41,I think it's a good thing the government is not pushing a vaccine issue.
92,43,People have to care more about their health than their kids. They have to think about it and figure out what they care about. They need to think about how much of it their kids care about.
92,45,I am a doctor in Texas. This is a joke.
92,49,"If they were gonna see the law, then it would be a joke."
92,51,I don't understand what you're saying. I don't understand the context.
92,52,I have the worst health issues in the country and I know where I live. It seems like it's not really going to work out well. It doesn't seem like it would make a difference in other countries.
92,57,[This is a really good joke. Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.What a silly joke! The government is not allowed to stop people from using these products because of some government policy. It's just a joke.
92,59,We are not required to give vaccines to those with a medical license. The government isn't allowed to do so because the government does not care about the people who have the disease.
92,61,"I don't want to say he's a doctor or a doctor, but he did not say he was a doctor, so I do not think he is being a doctor."
92,72,I've been at a public health hospital for two years now and the doctors have been telling me I am not going to go in every day without a mask. But I'm not going to take a bath or go to a doctor if I'm in a public hospital.
92,77,"Vaccines are not legal. Because vaccines are dangerous, dangerous, dangerous. And they are legal. Because vaccines are dangerous, dangerous, dangerous. And they are legal."
92,83,I am a lawyer and I don't even believe you are trying to justify the medical procedure of the medical doctor who is going to prescribe this to you.
92,84,"Vaccines are dangerous, dangerous, dangerous, dangerous and have the potential to cause fatalities. Vaccines are not legally required unless you are a physician."
92,88,"Vaccines are illegal because of the health of a person. It's dangerous, dangerous, dangerous. And they are legal."
92,3,I am a doctor in Texas. This is a funny joke.
92,21,"I've heard the phrase ""I have not gotten sick for two years. I will not even come out the door tomorrow."""
92,28,Why did we have this conversation a while back? Why would you keep your doctor in your office?
92,29,"I don't know why you are getting downvoted here, but he has a valid point about a joke."
92,40,"You're asking a question about the law, not the fact that the person is being a joke, or that a doctor is trying to make them illegal."
92,41,Vaccines are not illegal. They are not required unless the CDC is trying to make them illegal.
92,43,"I'm a physician in Texas. I can confirm that a lot of people have heard a good joke about the safety of the CDC, but that they aren't legally required to give vaccines to those with a medical license."
92,45,It's a joke and you're not gonna get a job.
92,49,"Yes, a joke is a joke."
92,51,"This is how to tell a joke. You can be a doctor and the government is trying to push it into law. It's a joke. This is a joke, not a law. You can't tell the CDC is trying to push it into law. If you think they are doing it on purpose, the government has to take the word ""higgins."" Seriously, people have no idea what they're talking about."
92,52,A lot of the people in the story are probably wrong.
92,57,"That's the joke. Vaccines are legal because they are dangerous, dangerous, dangerous, and have the potential to cause fatalities. Vaccines are not legally required unless you are a physician. Vaccines are not legally required unless you are a physician. Vaccines are not legally required unless you are a doctor. Vaccines are not legally required unless you are a physician. Vaccines are not legally required unless you are a doctor. Vaccines are not legally required unless you are a doctor."
92,59,"Why not just have a doctor that is a public health practitioner? Because, if I were you, I would think that a doctor would be a better fit for my wife."
92,61,"Because vaccines are dangerous, dangerous, dangerous. And they are legal."
92,72,They want to keep those who take the vaccine in the public hospital and go there every day.
92,77,It's a joke. That's how it works.
92,83,"You lied to someone. Now, you have to reevaluate your health."
92,84,"Vaccines are dangerous, dangerous, dangerous, dangerous and have the potential to cause fatalities. Vaccines are not legally required unless you are a physician. What makes you think that vaccines are illegal is that they are legal."
92,88,"I think there isn't anything to it in the context of this story. The government is pushing an illegal policy, not a joke."
92,3,"If people thought they knew better, you wouldn't care at all. If he's being funny, and you're being a fool, he doesn't deserve to hear the word joke. You seem to think he's being funny, and the same thing is true of all jokes. But if you read this and say ""I suck to get sick"" the guy isn't kidding, and the doctor's joke is a joke, not a joke."
92,21,"I'm a doctor in Texas, but it is also the only thing I can see that would be used as a joke. This is how the US's health care system operates. It isn't legally required by law, because you can't legally give someone a vaccine if it's already in your system. They aren't required by law because people are not authorized to get one."
92,28,"What you want a doctor to say? They want a doctor who will have a medical license that doesn't give them any protection, they want to keep those who take them in the public hospital and go there every day."
92,29,Are you sure you have a medical license?
92,40,"I've been to Texas to get vaccinated and there have been many times that I have gotten sick due to them. They have had to take vaccines twice and vaccinats once are considered an act of war. If I were in a position to prevent an outbreak of a virus, there would be some kind of drug or alcohol ban or something. That's just it, the point is not that the person is being a joke, but that a joke is being made."
92,41,"The only thing that has been going on in Texas for a while, I can confirm, is that this is a joke. Vaccines are not illegal. They are not legally required. And they are not required. They are not required. And they are not required."
92,43,"As a doctor who has been to the CDC, it seems that I'm being a joke, that's why I want to be a doctor."
92,45,"This isn't a joke, this is a law. It's a joke that is going to make the federal government work to make vaccines illegal."
92,49,What is a joke? What is a joke? Why isn't a joke just a joke?
92,51,"> ""I don't want people to be sick and sick. That is all, except that there is no govt in their country. "", ""I don't want people to be sick and sick, but I would like to know about my options for getting a free and unharmed vaccine for my hands."""
92,52,>We are allowed to get a free and unharmed vaccination for my hands. They are not illegal.
92,57,"I mean, why would a doctor want a doctor? Because that's a joke."
92,59,"I work in the private sector, and the public health office in my town. It's not as if they're legally required to provide services outside the clinic, and that's an illegal, poorly thought out joke, given that they are illegal in the local communities."
92,61,"Well, he didn't say he was a doctor and there are only a few doctors able to handle that sort of stuff. I guess he was thinking that the government is a joke to avoid being a doctor and the public."
92,72,I'm not an attorney. I'm not a lawyer.
92,77,"Is there a chance that you can get a job? I'm not sure, but there isn't any chance you can get one."
92,83,"I can say a lot of what you said about a joke that makes you believe that vaccines are illegal because they have the potential to cause fatalities. Vaccines are dangerous, dangerous, dangerous, and have the potential to cause fatalities. Vaccines are not legally required unless you are a physician."
92,84,That's not a joke. It's a joke.
92,88,"I'm a doctor. I would love to get one, but you guys are pretty pathetic."
92,3,"My mom says the same thing. 'Well, why would a doctor want a doctor? Because that's a joke."
92,21,"I've had to go back to my office once to get a vaccine to protect my hands from getting a virus, and I don't think there is a reason for that, but I think this is a really smart joke."
92,28,That's a joke. The government is trying to make vaccines illegal.
92,29,Why don't the CDC just tell them you're in need of a license? It's like a health care bill for a hospital in a state where you do not have access to medical care. I'm sure that you won't get a job.
92,40,Vaccines are illegal. This is the government's idea. The federal government has decided to go on with the job.
92,41,"That's what the joke is, isn't it?"
92,43,"No way he's being a joke. The government is causing you to get sick, you can't eat, you can't drink, you can't eat, you can't drink, you can't eat. The CDC is not going to ban them from having vaccines if they aren't properly licensed. The government is fucking up the law, and the government is pushing an illegal policy for the government to make vaccines illegal."
92,45,"A lot of people don't have a job, especially because they don't want to be in the medical field anymore. I'm a doctor, and I just want to know if I should be in the industry."
92,49,"I've been in the CDC for three years and it's absolutely the worst way I've ever been in my life. I can't see the difference between a joke and a joke. It was a joke at first, but the point is the government is pushing an illegal policy, not a joke."
92,51,>I'm a doctor and the CDC is trying to push it into law.
92,52,"If you can’t take one, you can’t even get one!"
92,57,Why are you in this sub.

92,83,"I'm not a doctor. I do not want to be the first person to take a vaccine that I can't have because of illness or lack of a proper health care provider. I want to get to know you better and to stay in touch with a licensed provider. I want to know if there are any responsibilities in your life that you can't have as a doctor. I would like to get to know you better, and also why they would want to make you stop going to the CDC to get a vaccine."
92,84,It's a joke. That's a joke. It's a joke.
92,88,"You can't have a medical record to help anyone. Vaccines are legal because of the health of a person. It's dangerous, dangerous, dangerous. And they are legal."
92,3,"Well, because I'm a doctor and my employer's insurance hasn't provided healthcare, that doesn't mean I have to do anything, especially if I am on public health insurance. If I don't care for my wife and have to help her, that's not going to be a joke."
92,21,"Are you a doctor in Texas? Because if you're a doctor. Because you have to get a vaccine, and the government doesn't care if you don't get your vaccine, then they're not allowed to take a vaccination on them."
92,28,And the only thing it's going to help to tell you about it is that you're not a doctor. I've also been trying to keep up with the health care debates with my insurance company. It's a joke.
92,29,Vaccines are not legal unless you have a CDC medical card or a prescription medication. They are not legal unless you have a prescription medication.
92,40,"They are illegal because they don't have to be mandatory or voluntary, and therefore can't be used by anyone. It's a joke."
92,41,"I had to take a class in Florida, to get my degree. I was on a PT program where I went to work every day. The classes were all about health, and you can do it if you want. The school is one of the best ones I could tell you about."

92,45,I'm sorry but I don't trust the mask mandate for those with HIV. So I don't believe that it's the only one required by law for those with HIV.
92,49,"I'm a doctor, and I've seen a few examples of a lot of people trying to get their hands on the vaccine, but I can't imagine being the first person to get a vaccine, or even a doctor to come and explain the law."

92,77,"In order to make this a joke, the government should make it illegal. But it will also be illegal for someone to take it if he did it."
92,83,The point is to make it legal.
92,84,I don't want to be the first person to take a vaccine that I can't have because of illness or lack of a proper health care provider.

92,40,"I don't know how a joke is made, but it doesn't help that it was intended in this particular context."

92,61,This is not a joke. The joke is actually quite funny.
92,72,"I read this in the context of a class in Florida, and while it wasn't a joke, the fact that I was in the hospital a lot in the early stages of the treatment of HIV is indicative of the fact that the government is trying to make it illegal, which is a pretty witty joke, as you can tell by the citation."
92,77,"I don't think anyone has mentioned that the government is trying to stop people from using the vaccine because of lack of a proper medical record, and that if you don't trust the government, you shouldn't be allowed to use your health care provider."
92,83,"""We are not legal. and they are not required. They are legal."""
92,84,"I've been reading through all of this for a while and you seem to have given me a huge chuckle. The word ""joke"" is a very generic joke referring to the CDC's attempts to make the federal government illegal."
92,88,It's not a joke. It's a joke. I don't think the CDC is going to pass any law in that state.
92,3,"I have a gf who is getting sick and is bringing up vaccinations as a joke. There's a joke about it being illegal. That's a joke about it being illegal. It's a joke, because it's a joke about something a good guy will say to get a laugh out of it."
92,21,This is a joke. This isn't a joke. This is a joke. This is a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. You're an idiot for not knowing anything about the vaccine mandate.
92,28,Are you a doctor? Because that's not one of the facts you have mentioned.
92,29,I'm a doctor and I get sick a lot of times but I am really bad at putting together a joke that's not a joke. It's not a joke. It's a joke.
92,40,"It's not a joke, but it's a joke."
92,41,My professor in grad school told me something about the CDC's attempts to make vaccines illegal in Texas.

92,49,That is exactly what you are trying to convey.
92,51,"I'm not a doctor. I can tell you what I'm telling you. I don't want people to be sick and sick, but I would like to know about my options for getting a free and unharmed vaccine for my hands."
92,52,"What if the government said ""I'm not a doctor. I'm not a pharmacist."" If people would say ""I don't want to be a doctor, but I do not care about his mother's health."" Whether it was a joke or not, there's a lot of misunderstanding here."

92,59,"That is a joke. I'm sorry Mark, but what do you mean?"
92,61,">I have been working in public health for two years and I don't want to go out every day without wearing a mask. This is not a joke. The joke is actually quite funny. I've been reading through all of this for a while and you seem to have given me a huge chuckle. The word ""joke"" is a very generic joke referring to the CDC's attempts to make the federal government illegal. It's not a joke."
92,72,"In what states is the CDC trying to make it illegal, and if it's made illegal, then it's illegal."
92,77,"In my city, doctors are not allowed to prescribe, get treated or refuse to prescribe any vaccines in public health care. They will only do it for that reason. It is also illegal to use a mask if someone doesn't want to. I would recommend getting a new one or re-visit a doctor's office, if your op can't do it, they are not required to do it."
92,83,What if there are no public health doctors?
92,84,That's the joke a lot of people want to be in public health. Hopefully you have read the article.
92,88,"Vaccines are illegal because of the health of a person. It's dangerous, dangerous, dangerous. And they are legal. They are legal. If there are real medical reasons for the CDC to make it illegal, then it's a joke."
92,3,"Is the word ""joke"" used in that article? I think I am missing the point, but the joke doesn't translate to something that is a joke."
92,21,if you do not know something about a vaccine that is illegal and you cannot read it you are a fraud and you must not follow it.
92,28,The joke is funny. It isn't a joke. It isn't a joke.
92,29,"I hate this sub, but I can't believe that this sub is full of people who think it's an easy joke that is used as a way of putting a joke together."
92,40,"There's an excellent explanation. I'll just say something along the lines of ""I don't want to be a doctor, but I do want to be a pharmacist."""
92,41,"So, is this a joke? Are the CDC trying to make it illegal?"
92,43,The problem isn't that it's not legal. It's that its a joke and its a way of bringing it up.
92,45,"I work in public health and they ain't trying to make it illegal. They are trying to make it illegal. They're gonna screw up, and if they get it wrong they don't even have a job. They don't have a mandate to make vaccines illegal, they're just gonna rip people off by saying they can't get a job."
92,49,"There are people out there whose medical job they are in whose job they do not have a doctor's license to use. In Texas, they have a 'doctor' license to use vaccines without the consent of the employer. They are there to get the vaccinated patients harmed, and the doctor or sceptics can make a referral to the doctor if needed. They don't want to fucking try to make them illegal, or not use them, but do not know the rules."
92,51,"It's an acronym for public health. It's the way doctors get treated. They know they can get their hands vaccinated, and they have the right to do it. They don't know they can prevent people from getting sick."
92,52,"CANNOTANSWER: a government agency that treats vaccines as a ""joke"" should do something about the CDC, not the federal government."
92,57,The CDC is in Texas. And the joke is that the CDC isn't going to make it illegal.
92,59,"People are sick of 'the vaccine mandate'? It's not a joke, it's a joke."
92,61,I’m a little confused because I don’t understand why a doctor would want to vaccinate people without permission of the public.
92,72,"In order to keep it illegal, the government must also make it illegal that people have the right to choose when they want a vaccine or when they need one."
92,77,I think that you're trying to convey a bit of a joke.
92,83,I would suggest that the doctor get a new one in Texas. This could work for anyone who can afford it.
92,84,"Yes, that joke is an excellent one."
92,88,"I'm sorry Mark, but I'm not a doctor, and I can tell you exactly what I'm telling you."
92,3,"Your story was quite interesting. If the government had made it illegal for vaccines, people wouldn't have taken the joke seriously."
92,21,"I'm not a doctor and don't know that the government is trying to make it illegal. I'm a doctor and I'm a good doctor, but not a doctor."
92,28,"I think a lot of people are going to think that vaccines are a joke, they're just saying that they are not legal and people are going to be dicks about them."
92,29,"Vaccines are illegal because of the health of a person. It's dangerous, dangerous, dangerous. And they are legal. If there are real medical reasons for the CDC to make it illegal, then it's a joke."
92,40,Why don't you get a job as a pharmacist?
92,41,A CDC official slapped a clause into the ACT.
92,43,I'd just like to say the truth of the story:

92,49,"This was one of the most ridiculous jokes I've heard in my life. I'm a doctor, and if I wanted to be in a public health organization, I had to look it up on my CV."
92,51,"I think they have some ideas about how to make it illegal, but that's a bit different."
92,52,"I've been in the U.S. for 5 years, and my grandmother didn't know that vaccinations were required in her state. I've told her to be a doctor. I know what I'm doing. I feel like I could not be more helpless about it."
92,57,The CDC is in Texas. And they aren't going to make it illegal.
92,59,"I'm not talking about that joke, but the CDC's ""joke"" that's using the word ""joke"" is actually that the doctor has the authority to prescribe vaccines without the doctor's license."
92,61,"Vaccines are dangerous, dangerous, dangerous. And they are legal."
92,72,"""Since my life hasn't changed, I'm gonna stop using them and be a doctor."

92,84,"I don't understand why the word ""joke"" comes across as like ""Jack."""
92,88,"This is the snarkiest part of this thread, and it's hilarious."
92,3,[I can not understand why people have been calling out the CDC for what they want to make a joke about.
92,21,I am not going to cite any actual facts for the joke if you want to use them as a substitute for the actual facts.
92,28,I'd like to say that the government is trying to make it illegal.
92,29,I get sick a lot of times but I am really bad at putting together a joke that's not a joke. It's like a health care bill for a hospital in a state where you do not have access to medical care.
92,40,"This is one of the most ridiculous jokes I've heard in my life. I feel like I could not be more helpless about it. Vaccines are illegal because of the health of a person.

92,41,The CDC is in Texas and if the article isn't a joke they don't have a right to make it illegal.
92,43,"I don't get the joke. It's just a joke, right?"
92,45,"The CDC in Texas is one of the few government agencies that recognize that a doctor is not a doctor in Texas. In that case, that is, an issue with a person without a license, because they don't have a license to prescribe them - they aren't legally allowed to use it and are not required to do so."
92,49,"I've been in the CDC for 5 years and it's absolutely the worst way I've ever been in my life. I'm a doctor, and I've seen a few examples of a lot of people trying to get their hands on the vaccine, but I can't imagine being the first person to get a vaccine, or even a doctor to come and explain the law."", ""There is literally no point to making a joke about your job and having a job."", ""There are people out there whose medical job they do not have the authority to use"
92,51,"Vaccines are illegal because of the health of a person. It's dangerous, dangerous, dangerous. And they are legal."
92,52,"I am so sorry you don't understand the ""judgement"" of these jokes in the ACT."
92,57,A doctor who is a doctor in Texas is a doctor.
92,59,"CANNOTANSWER: A government agency that treats vaccines as a ""joke"" should do something about the CDC, not the federal government. The CDC is in Texas. Is it legal because I do not have a license? And if not, do not get it."

92,72,"Vaccines are illegal because of the health of a person. It's dangerous, dangerous, dangerous. And they are legal."
92,77,"I don't want to be a doctor, but I would rather have a doctor in my home state."
92,83,"If we have no federal regulations on vaccinations, then it is a joke."
92,84,"I'm not a doctor and I don't think this joke is ridiculous. I mean, the FDA is one of the largest organizations in the world, but in most cases the FDA has some pretty bad laws about vaccines. The only ones I'm familiar with are public health organizations that actually require a license to prescribe vaccines. The CDC is not trying to make the federal government illegal."
92,88,"That's right, the CDC is a joke & they're not doing anything about it"
92,3,...and the joke is being made up.
92,21,"In some cases, a doctor who does not have a license is a doctor."
92,28,I can't think of anything wrong with wearing a mask because I get sick every day...
92,29,This was made up by a lawyer at the CDC.
92,40,A government agency putting up with a joke would make a joke about the law as well. It's not a joke. It's a joke. The CDC is trying to make it illegal.
92,41,"I'm a doctor in Texas and I work for the CDC. I understand that they use a ""cigarette"" and the CDC is a joke."
92,43,"This is just another witty joke, and one that comes from a guy who can't believe the government has already tried to make vaccines illegal. That joke is about medical and public health insurance."
92,45,"The CDC is in Texas. It's one of the few government agencies that recognize that a doctor is not a doctor in Texas. In that case, that is, an issue with a person without a license. They aren't legally allowed to use them and are not required to do so."
92,49,"There is a difference between ""a joke"" and a joke. You don't get the joke, and that's all there is to it. There are multiple reasons for not getting the joke."
92,51,"""Whilst I can't agree that it's illegal to be a doctor without a license, I'd like to know about my options for getting a free and unharmed vaccine for my hands. It's dangerous, dangerous, dangerous. And they are legal."""
92,52,I'm sure the CDC understands that the government needs to get on top of these things because it isn't in the right place.
92,57,"It's a snarky joke if you know what I mean, it's not legal to go to work without a mask. This is what you're saying."
92,59,"CANNOTANSWER: A government agency that treats vaccines as a joke should do something about the CDC, not the federal government. The CDC is in Texas. Is it legal because I do not have a license? And if not, do not get it."
92,61,I have been working in public health for 2 years and I don't want to go out every day without wearing a mask. The joke is actually quite funny.
92,72,The federal government is not trying to make vaccines illegal because people don't have the same health care responsibilities as doctors and their children. The federal government is just trying to make it illegal and get more people to vaccinate and help keep people safe.
92,77,No one is trying to stop people from using vaccines. It is a joke.
92,83,"Vaccines are illegal because of the health of a person. It's dangerous, dangerous, dangerous. And they are legal. Vaccines are illegal because of the health of a person. It's dangerous, dangerous, dangerous. And they are legal."

And they are not required. And they are not required. And they are not required. And they are not required. And they are not required.
92,43,So why can't you go to work without a mask and ask for one? Because you can do it all day without it and not to look in the mirror? Probably not.
92,45,''I can't trust the mask mandate for those with HIV. So I don't believe that it's the only one required by law.
92,49,That’s a joke that can be uttered without being made up.
92,51,The fact that you want to get a free and unharmed vaccine for your hands is just one of the most stupid jokes I've ever read.
92,52,"Is a doctor legally obligated to take vaccines in Texas? Because no, it's not legal to do so. I have a health history that i can relate to."

92,77,I'm a doctor in Texas and I work for the CDC.
92,83,The CDC and CDC are in Texas. The CDC is in Texas. The CDC is in Texas.
92,84,Because you said you had a health history of a virus. You have health histories that can be traced back to disease or illness. You have medical history of an illness that you haven't identified as HIV.
92,88,"Vaccines are illegal because of the health of a person. It's dangerous, dangerous, dangerous. And they are legal."
92,3,Vaccines are illegal in Tex. There is a government agency that is not legal to make them illegal.
92,21,"If you don't want to know why something is illegal, you should talk to a lawyer. That way you can make an informed decision and be sure that everyone who is in your field is properly protected."

92,83,"I was in a similar situation to Mark and he said he had been sick in the past. It was a joke that the government was putting up with.

92,61,The CDC does not want to make it illegal. It's illegal because they are unable to control.
92,72,The people who didn't say they were using them are not being able to have children at home.
92,77,"Yes, but I also wanted to point out that the CDC has not been asked to consider a mandatory vaccine to protect HIV in the past. This is just like the CDC."
92,83,I was in a similar situation to Mark and he said he had been sick in the past.
92,84,"CANNOTANSWER, MD: I work for the CDC."
92,88,"The question here is ""Why do the doctors in this state get such bad medical treatment?"""
92,3,"What if it wasn't illegal? Vaccines are not illegal in Texas, as they are in Texas."
92,21,"I've never seen someone use the term ""joke"" in that way before and I've heard that ""I have not gotten sick for two years. I won't even come out the door tomorrow."""
92,28,There are a few exceptions to the general public's view on medical malpractice.
92,29,"In general, if a doctor in a state with HIV is a doctor and he knows the truth then he is a doctor. But a doctor in a state with HIV is a doctor."
92,40,There's no good way to make a joke. It's a joke. There is nothing wrong with the law. It's just something people use to get rid of and they keep going.
92,41,"In the US, doctors are NOT legally required to have a vaccine for HIV because they are not in Texas. That's a joke."
92,43,A lot of people have jokingly stated that the CDC is in Texas.
92,45,"""I'm a doctor and a CDC member. I want a job in Texas because I can get one."""
92,49,This isn't really a joke. It's a joke that is intended to be funny and made to convey a moral and ethical point.
92,51,If you get sick a lot in the hospital then you have a vaccine and a doctor who is not a doctor will have to stop you.
92,52,"CANNOTANSWER, MD: ''When the government asks for a vaccination in Texas, I think it’s a good idea to make it illegal, and in doing so, we are preventing people from bringing it up. I don’t have a good idea what to do.’”"

92,84,I don't think you're going to get any jokes. The CDC has to provide medical care to all of the people and it's legal in Texas.
92,88,I work at a hospital that has a physician who believes that vaccinations are illegal in Texas but is not required by law. He wants to work as a doctor because it's a joke.
92,3,"I'm a lawyer and I have an attorney. My job is to write for the CDC on behalf of the CDC. My employer is the CDC but does not have the authority to make a joke about a legality or medical status of someone with HIV. Vaccines are not legal in Texas, because they aren't a federal agency."
92,21,There are two kinds of jokes:
92,28,The article says the CDC isn't required to provide the vaccine to people in the public hospital or at the hospital itself.
92,29,"...and then the CDC tells me the law was made against people who were vaccinated to prevent people from getting HIV. That it is illegal to sterilize their hands, which would probably cause more harm than good."
92,40,"Nope, just a joke. The government is doing it because a doctor does not like it, but because a doctor who has it is not allowed to have it, which is what a doctor should do if a doctor does not like it."
92,41,In a few states I could say they aren't required to have a vaccine for HIV as they are not in Texas.
92,43,So what did you say in your comment?
92,45,What are some of the reasons why you haven't seen it before?
92,49,The CDC doesn't have a mandate to sterilize your hands when he is out of work. They only require that you have a license to use them. The federal government doesn't want to make it illegal.
92,51,No. This is not a joke. This is a joke. It is a joke.

92,43,I'm a Texan and I've worked for the CDC for a number of years and they are in Texas. I have worked there for a while and the CDC is in Texas. I can confirm that they haven't passed the laws to allow vaccines in many places. They've not passed them yet.
92,45,"CANNOTANSWER, MD:"
92,49,It's a joke.
92,51,I'm going to ask why you were so concerned about this when you are in your 90s.
92,52,"""A doctor in a state where the CDC is not a federal agency, the CDC is in Texas. I don't trust the government."
92,57,"CANNOTANSWER is a doctor in Texas, and he wrote a lot of things here and I'm not sure where he started."
92,59,"This CDC is in Texas, and despite the jokes, I do not see why it's a joke."
92,61,Is there any point in being a doctor?
92,72,What the heck? Because you don't want a CDC/CDC-funded insurance plan?
92,77,The CDC has no authority to change this policy. The only reason they are required to do it is because they are a private agency.
92,83,"In Texas they need to be notified by state agency to the Federal Department of Health, so they have to provide the medical kit, not the vaccinated person's prescription. The doctor must be on his own and not contracted. There's no statutory authority on vaccination."
92,84,"In general, if a doctor in a state where the CDC is not a federal agency, the CDC is in Texas. I do not know what to say about this, but I do see the joke being a joke."
92,88,Are you a doctor? Because I am.
92,3,A lawyer here who has worked at the CDC has said there is a federal agency that is not legal to make vaccinations illegal. I am not a doctor in Texas. It is not illegal in Texas. The CDC is a federal agency.
92,21,"They need to notify the CDC that they are not required to change the law. In general, if a doctor in a state where the CDC is not a federal agency, they have to provide the medical kit, not the vaccinated person's prescription. The doctor must be on his own and not contracted. There's no statutory authority on vaccination."
92,28,"Yes. A joke. Yes, but a joke. It is a joke."
92,29,"'I'm going to point out that if the government wants to make it illegal, they need to take on some kind of new legal responsibility."""
92,40,I think what he was trying to say is:
92,41,"I don't know why people were so upset, but I've heard of someone saying it's a joke, not a joke. I've heard a lot of things from this guy."
92,43,"I'm a physician who works at a CDC for 5 years and is a doctor. But, when a doctor is a doctor, he doesn't need to be a doctor. He doesn't need to be a doctor."
92,45,"It is a joke, a joke that is a joke, and not a joke. It is a joke, and not a joke."
92,49,The joke is being made by a woman in Texas.
92,51,There is an online conversation on Reddit about the possibility that a joke would become legal when Congress passed legislation to prevent the spread of a virus.
92,52,"A doctor that refuses to provide vaccines to anyone, except one of its employees, has no right to have one."
92,57,"I don't think the person that is saying that is a joke. But the person who says it was a joke and I don't understand why they are being so obnoxious, and why they don't want to change the policy? Unless the person is a doctor, they shouldn't care about it."
92,59,It's a joke that's not legal in Texas.
92,61,"It's not a joke, it's a joke."
92,72,"CANNOTANSWER, MD: “I’ve been working in public health for two years and I don’t want to go out every day without a mask. I would like to see your hand vaccinated, or get some help getting it fixed. I don’t want to be a doctor, but I can’t help you, Mark. Vaccines are not required in most places, and that they aren’t required. They are not legal. Because vaccines are dangerous, dangerous, dangerous. And they are illegal."
92,77,"""I'm a doctor in my early 20s and have always had to use a mask. I have never felt unsafe."""
92,83,The joke isn't about the CDC and it's not about the CDC. It's about the CDC and the CDC not doing their own thing.
92,84,"As an attorney representing the CDC, you might want to consider filing a complaint with the CDC requesting a license and getting it vaccinated with the law. Generally speaking, people who work with the FDA are required to provide the vaccination kit at the medical clinic, and will have to pay up to $5,000 for the vaccine kit and any medication needed."
92,88,"IANAL, but the question you are asking is based on the first part of the title. It doesn't seem like an ideal state to be a doctor, and the question is, isn't it appropriate to have a doctor work in a different state than yours?"
92,3,"I work for the CDC as a physician, but I've never heard of someone saying something like ""This is a joke."" I don't understand your perspective. I know that people might not want to hear this joke, but it's very hard for me to understand that it's a joke and I'm sorry for your pain and frustration."
92,21,I work as a doctor and I've always wondered if you are a doctor in a govt state?
92,28,"I don't know what they say. I mean, I think the joke is being made by a woman, not a lawyer. The CDC and CDC are in Texas. The CDC and CDC are in Texas, so they are in Texas."
92,29,"I am not sure how the CDC was doing that, but a doctor whose job is to prevent or prevent people from getting HIV is still going to be a good doctor."
92,40,"Yes, it is a joke. It is a joke. It is a joke."
92,41,I am a medical student in a doctor's college. My boss is a doctor and that's pretty much how it goes.
92,43,"I feel like it's a joke because it is, but it doesn't sound like it's a joke. I just don't know what the joke is about, so I don't have a clue."
92,45,"I've never worked in a medical field, but I did work in a community clinic in texas and my supervisor has to remind me that the CDC's 'dangerous' vaccination mandate is an illegal requirement of work. There is a 'compromise' between a doctor and a doctor, as there is a difference between the mandate and a mandate of work."
92,49,"Then your first comment on this thread should be titled ""Which state are you in?"""
92,51,"When the issue is that he says he's not a doctor, it's a joke."
92,52,"I would argue that vaccination is a joke. I would say that in Texas you aren't required to be a doctor or a pharmacist to provide a vaccine, and the government isn't required to provide the vaccine. If you are not allowed to be a doctor, you are not required to be a doctor."
92,57,"I'm wondering if you mean I'm not a doctor, and if it would have something to do with the idea of having a doctor working in Texas, I'd guess that it'd just be because it's not legal and the person is not a doctor."
92,59,"Yes, he's trying to tell a joke about the state of Texas."
92,61,It's a joke.
92,72,"I read this in context of a class in Florida, and while it wasn't a joke, the fact that I was in the hospital a lot in the early stages of the treatment of HIV is indicative of the fact that the government is trying to make it illegal."
92,77,“I’m a doctor in my early 20s and have always had to use a mask. I have never felt unsafe.”
92,83,What do you think 'I'm so sorry mark but I don't trust the vaccine?'
92,84,"You are right. It is inappropriate to have a medical professional work in Texas. I’m sorry to say, but a doctor working in Texas shouldn’t be required to do that. And not like it is improper, but the doctors union is a bad organization, that can help a sick person live their own lives - they don’t if they have any responsibility for their health. It’s a joke to make, but it’s a joke to make. Especially considering the cost of an HIV vaccine despite the potential to make a doctor’s job, "
92,88,"""I would like to see your hand vaccinated, or get some help getting it fixed. I don't care about my body. I don't care about my family and I have to help my wife. I care about the best interests of my children."""
92,3,"If the person isn't a doctor, it's not a joke."
92,21,"I don't know if the joke is funny but I think the joke was made a bit too far. The government is trying to make it illegal by making it a joke, that's why it is illegal."
92,28,I had to read the first one and read the second one and a half times. I am sorry.
92,29,"Yes, I love the idea that people are using this as a platform for expressing opinions about doctors and what they want to do in general. The reason being is because people are not used to doctors or doctors not getting vaccinations, and they need to get their fucking hands cleaned up. It is a joke because people think they can do better. Then the doctor will find out what the government is trying to do, and that they'll be able to be more productive with the health care in their communities."
92,40,Do you have a job with the CDC?
92,41,"I work for a doctor's college in Texas and there are more than 10 doctors working in a community clinic in Texas, all of them who work there. They are in my city. I haven't even heard of anyone who questioned the validity of this claim."
92,43,"It is a joke, but not legal. Its not a joke, and is not legal."
92,45,"The CDC, the CDC, the CDC., [(http://www.aol.gov/):(http://www.aol.gov/):(http://www.aol.gov/):(http://www.aol.gov/):(http://www.aol.gov/):(http://www.aol.gov/):(http://www.aol.gov/):(http://www.aol.doc//"
92,49,I'm confused and confused because they do not use vaccines and I think it's wrong.
92,51,I think he means that he doesn’t want to be a doctor and is a doctor in the first place.
92,52,"The issue is the CDC is a joke, which is a joke."
92,57,"I am not a doctor, I am a pharmacist. I am not a doctor, I am a pharmacist."
92,59,I'd consider an employer who has no problem with 'emergency & safety issues' as a joke.
92,61, The government does not have the right to prevent people from using the vaccine without the consent of the public.
92,72,"""I'm not a doctor, but I don't want to take any medication if I'm not vaccinated. I'm sure I can. But I'm not gonna have a vaccine if I'm not vaccinated. I'm not going to have a vaccine if I am not vaccinated."""
92,77,"CANNOTANSWER, MD: Is the CDC in your state? Is it not?"
92,83,"Vaccines are illegal because they have the potential to cause fatalities. Vaccines are dangerous, dangerous, dangerous, and have the potential to cause fatalities."
92,84,It's a joke. It's not a joke. It's a joke.
92,88,"No, they're not. That's just not an ideal state. The government should be allowed to make a decision on these things, but in general, a joke is about this. Whether or not the government or the government are trying to make a bad joke is beyond the scope of that paragraph."
92,3,I'm a doctor and I work for the CDC.
92,21,The CDC wants to make vaccines illegal. [[[NAME]]:
92,28,I'm not a doctor. I am a doctor. I am a doctor.

92,41,Vaccines are illegal because they can cause fatalities.
92,43,People are jokingly saying that doctors are not legally required to give vaccines in the US. That is illegal and also illegal in many other countries. 'They aren't required to give vaccines' is a joke and not legal.
92,45,You are a doctor. You are a doctor.
92,49,Do you have a job with the CDC?
92,51,"It's not a joke, but it's a joke that the government is trying to push into law and make it illegal. The government is trying to make it illegal. It's a joke that the public hath no rights to, and it's actually illegal."
92,52,"The government needs to make it illegal, not legal."
92,57,I'm in Texas so I'm not sure what you are describing.
92,59,"I have a friend who works at a clinic in Texas. He has a license and it's a joke to the public. He works with doctors, but they are obligated to give them vaccines."
92,61,You're a joke isn't it?
92,72,"Vaccines are dangerous, dangerous, dangerous. And they are illegal. Because vaccines are dangerous, dangerous, dangerous. And they are illegal."
92,77,This is a good joke — but it's not legal — and in my opinion it's a joke — and it's just not legal — it's not illegal — it's not a joke.
92,83,">I'm not a doctor, but I don't want to take any medication if I'm not vaccinated."
92,84,"This is a joke. But a joke, is a joke."
92,88,I don't think there is any specific law that would make me think about this.
92,3,"As a lawyer, I can vouch that you're not in the wrong, but it's still a joke, and it's not legal. It's just a joke."
92,21,"I like you but I don't have a license, so I think my license is valid."
92,28,'It is a joke. The government is trying to make it illegal.'
92,29,"I like the idea that people are using this as a platform for expressing opinions about doctors and what they want to do in general. The reason being because people are not used to doctors or doctors not getting vaccinations, and they need to get their fucking hands cleaned up."

92,49,"They are in Texas so you don't have a job with the CDC. I don't want to say I don't think they are a joke, but they're a joke. They're a joke about what they are doing."
92,51,"This a lot of jokes and jokes, but a lot of people are joking too."
92,52,I'm from Texas. I work for the CDC.
92,57,You're in a joke
92,59,Is this a joke?
92,61,"The other side of the joke is the fact that doctors are not required to have vaccinated people without consent, which is not legal in the US. 'Vaccines are dangerous, dangerous, dangerous. And they are legal.'"
92,72,I think the CDC needs to make it illegal.
92,77,"If I was a doctor, I'd have a second thought. I'd be a doctor, but I don't think I'm a doctor, because I don't trust doctors."
92,83,"I am a doctor, and I am the only one that's legally required for people with HIV."
92,84,"I'm sorry I'm an CDC employee, but I don't believe that there is any actual law to make a vaccine illegal. It's legal."

92,3,I can't help but think that it's a joke about something that a good guy would say to get a laugh out of.
92,21,"I don't understand what the joke is about, and I don't get it."
92,28,Is the CDC required to provide the vaccine to people without permission?

92,43,I think the law needs to be made illegal and people are being called out and shit for it.
92,45,"You are in a joke and the government is trying to make it illegal. You are a doctor and a CDC member, and you are a doctor and a CDC member?"
92,49,The joke is being made by a woman in Texas.
92,51,I'm a medical doctor in Texas.
92,52,The joke has more to do with the CDC being not obligated to supply vaccines.
92,57,I'm from Houston and I'm a doctor and I don't want to have any kind of job that allows me to have a vaccinated person for free when I don't need a doctor. I do get my health insurance and I get my own doctor who is not a vaccinated person.
92,59,[Dj](http://www.unitrl.org/about-the-canadian-medical-care-laws) said in his post:
92,61,There are no laws in the US prohibiting people from using a mask without consent. A doctor would need to take care of their patients' hands. They need to get their hands cleaned up.

Vaccines are illegal because they can cause fatalities. People are jokingly saying that doctors are not legally required to give vaccines in the US.

92,77,Doctors are legal in most countries and aren't required to take a vaccine. They are not required to carry a vaccine.
92,83,Not legal as a joke.
92,84,"CANNOTANSWER, MD: The phrase ""joke"" is a very generic joke referring to the CDC's attempts to make the federal government illegal. The CDC is trying to make it illegal."
92,88,There are no laws to prohibit it. And there are no laws to prevent them.
92,3,"CANNOTANSWER, MD:"
92,21,"In my opinion, this joke is a joke that's very egregious and not a legitimate joke."
92,28,"So you're using the phrase ""joke"" in the same sentence? It's one of the many jokes I see posted at this website and I'm not the only one who finds it funny."
92,29,The first paragraph seems to describe what I mean.
92,40,"I had a vaccination that worked at a narcotics store in the midwest that didn't require you to get one. It triggered a lot of obnoxious and dangerous behavior in the public health system, which was the reason why it was considered a joke in many places, and that the narcotics market has been flooded with cases. And then the narcotics market has exploded. They are illegal because they can cause fatalities, but they are illegal because it is illegal to do that."
92,41,"It's all about the 'right' to be a doctor. But you need to work, I know, because the government has a lot of issues with them, and if you don't want to work, do it."
92,43,I'm actually a doctor here. I've been with the CDC for 5 years and I've heard the story. And I really don't want to go work without a mask.
92,45,The word 'joke' comes from a quote that's not only from the CDC but also from CDC members.
92,49,They don't want to make it illegal. They don't want to make it illegal.
92,51,"CANNOTANSWER, MD:"
92,52,"Yes, it is illegal to make a vaccine on the public's hands. I'm not sure why people are worried."

92,61,A very interesting fact that makes it even harder to figure out is that doctors can be medically vaccinated without consent to do so and there are no laws against that. I can't remember if they are legal.
92,72,"CANNOTANSWER, MD: The phrase ""joke"" is a very generic joke referring to the CDC's attempts to make it illegal. The CDC is trying to make it illegal."
92,77,The CDC is in Texas.
92,83,"There are not many laws that are relevant to medical malpractice laws in Texas, including the one that states that public health is not required to provide vaccinations for non-communicable diseases. That would be the legal definition of ""legally required"" in a non-female health care plan. Vaccines have not a vaccine for infectious diseases."
92,84,It doesn't make sense that you are on a job that isn't required to supply it unless you are a physician. It's simply not practical.

92,21,No one should ever be in the position of knowing something like this. It should be in the top 25.
92,28,You have a good point. That's how you have this question:
92,29,Vaccines are illegal because of the health of a person. They are illegal because they can cause fatalities. People are jokingly saying that doctors are not legally required to give vaccines in the US. That is illegal and also illegal in many other countries. Vaccines are illegal because they can cause fatalities.
92,40,"It's a joke, but I'm not sure why you want to work without a mask."
92,41,That's an interesting piece. The question is whether Vaccines are illegal in Texas.

92,45,"CANNOTANSWER, MD:"
92,49,"No? The CDC would never need a mandate to sterilize their hands without a CDC license, and it wouldn't be illegal, because that's the only way to guarantee that it's not legal. The fact that there are no laws to make it illegal."
92,51,The one you're referring to is a joke.
92,52,''I'm sure the CDC understands that the government needs to get on top of these things because it isn't in the right place.''
92,57,The CDC is not a federal agency. The CDC is not a private agency.

92,88,> We do not need to wear a mask to stop the spread of a virus. There are no laws to prohibit it. And there are no laws to prevent them. Vaccines are illegal because they can cause fatalities.
92,3,I haven't heard of anyone making a joke about vaccinations because I'm a doctor.
92,21,...that's why it's illegal. And what it's going to do is get a lot of media attention from the government.
92,28,No. This is a joke.
92,29,I haven't read the full article. It's kind of misleading that the CDC is trying to make it illegal unless a state attorney drafted an advisory board.

92,77,What the CDC says is not accurate and misleading. In general it is not a joke.
