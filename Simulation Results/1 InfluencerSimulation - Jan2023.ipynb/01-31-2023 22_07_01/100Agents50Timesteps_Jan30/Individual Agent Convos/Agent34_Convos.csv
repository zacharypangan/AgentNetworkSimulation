34,4,"Yes. And no, the government is required to do it in every national public hospital and not just in private ones."
34,9,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.As encouraging as this news is please remember that this new cdc guideline still calls for wearing masks in federal facilities including airports
34,15,I'm really confused. What was the question in your post?
34,21,I would kindly invite you to wear a mask if you've been a resident of the area - which is why i would be so excited to come in to talk to you on the phone or on the phone
34,23,I don't have a job i wear a mask to work with people who are in danger for life. I know one person who was just getting infected and she ended up in the hospital.
35,34,i don't believe the government is willing to provide a solution.
49,34,"You are not the only person who can help prevent the spread of a virus, you are the only person who can abide by the rules."
58,34,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
68,34,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
70,34,That's a good one. There are millions of us and it will cost millions to keep a mask on and prevent an outbreak and a relapse.
73,34,... you are a fucking pedophile.
74,34,I'm pretty sure I have covid phobia. I don't like wearing a mask because I can't stand wearing it.
81,34,You should check out the other links for some useful stuff about the government.
82,34,"If you would prefer to stay in the country and have your head turned into a helmet, you would need to wear a mask."
93,34,Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
34,4,It says that it will cost the government millions to keep a mask on and prevent the spread of the virus.
34,9,"OP, there is a cdc / NHA guideline for that... i.e., a mandate for a new national public hospital, an outbreak of a virus and a national mandate for a new national government to prevent a virus from spreading."
34,15,I'm pretty sure I have covid phobia. I don't like wearing a mask because I can't stand wearing it.
34,21,>I'm really confused. What was the question in your post?
34,23,"Aside from a ''Mad Hat''' message in the video, I think it's a good idea to make some more explicit reference to what you're saying."
35,34,"So you guys have a slap on the wrist for ""putting off the drive up test""?"
49,34,What I see in the video are some of the symptoms of viruses. Is there anything you can do to prevent it?
58,34,"I am not sure about the'masked pigeon' part, but I think the government should be more open about this, but it should also be a statement that I'm a big pigeon snobby."
68,34,"I am a child of a man who wears a mask to protect his child, unless he is very afraid of a child who has a virus, and he doesn't want to be in the wrong place at the right time. He says he has a virus, but not a welders mask."
70,34,Vaccination is a mandatory vaccination of the US government.
73,34,"So I'm gonna ask you, what does that mean to you?"
74,34,I don't like wearing a mask because I can't stand wearing it.
81,34,And the government must have taken care of people with a mask to prevent the spread of a virus.
82,34,">I wish more people had the opportunity to explain what the government is doing IANAL, but i do not think the government is concerned with the effect of such a mandate."
93,34,"The whole reason for wearing a mask is that when people wear a mask, they're doing something like 'Mom'."
34,4,"I've never seen a guy with a mask wearing a virus, and i've seen people who do this. And it sounds like you are using a joke, not saying that it isn't a joke."
34,9,This is just a slap on the wrist for doing nothing. I think the question here is: do people like it?
34,15,I think the reason for a mask is that people are doing something like 'Mom'.
34,21,I'm trying to get the pigeon out of my head and say no. What's the message?
34,23,"They are saying the ""masked pigeon"" is a mask that doesn't cover the virus, so they're asking if it's a mask that stops it from spreading."
35,34,"I mean, we can do some work on that. It's not a bad thing, but it is a good thing. The one of them is that the person in question must be a little more mature in their beliefs, and their perspective on the subject is completely different, even when they aren't in the same place at the same time....I just don't see how the masks in these things are possible. But the fact that people who don't get vaccines are more willing to be vaccinated, and that's what the problem is."
49,34,>I am so sorry mark but I don't trust this vaccine
58,34,> Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
68,34,"In California you can't wear a mask. If you're not in a position to be in that position, you aren't in any position to be in a position to be in."
70,34,I believe a lot of people who have vaccinated themselves and have been vaccinated do not think the danger is worth the cost and inconvenience.
73,34,"A federal mask mandate should protect your rights and make you a person in the world. So I'm gonna ask you, what does that mean to you?"
74,34,"Vaccines are not what the government wants. We have more than 1000 vaccines, and those people should take that into account when planning an emergency response."
81,34,I want to know why this is so popular among kids... 'the government must have taken care of people with a mask to prevent the spread of a virus.'
82,34,I would like to say that the government is doing a good job of explaining this to the US and not to people who are not the ones with a fecal problem.
93,34,Its very possible that you don't have to wear a mask to prevent a virus. But for a santa to wear a mask and get a run is very different. Its a joke about being taken advantage of.
34,4,And I'm gonna tell you to go back to the internet to ask a question...
34,9,"[RAPID](http://www.afra.gov/news/news/articles_afra/news_afra/news/pdf_report/06/03/06/Reporting_afra_reporting_afra_reporting.html) is an excerpt from a recent interview by [Michael K. Smith, ed., [who affa.gov/news/articles/reports_afra_she_she_"
34,15,"It's just that a guy who wears a mask is going to get an immunity test and he'll likely be a victim of a virus attack. It's a different type of mask and he'll be better at identifying it. He's not going to be on the same side as your father or a kid, it's just an obvious sign of weakness."
34,21,I'm not sure if the CDC would be able to change the rules to prevent the spread of the virus if the CDC changed the CDC's recommendations. I'd guess that the government would be more concerned with preventing it being spread than with it being an anti-virus measure.
34,23,I'd rather know that the masks at the airport are a joke.
35,34,I'm a guy and a lot of people wear masks because I like to wear them in public. I can't go out in public without it because I don't want to be in public with it. I'm in an uncomfortable environment and I can't handle going out with my friends or family and they might think I'm a jerk. I think it’s really not that stupid to say you should wear a mask. I’m wearing a mask on my nose and nose every day. I'm not the best.
49,34,I think the vaccine should be legalized as a medical tool because we do not have it in our country. So you have to go to your local govt office to have the vaccine. That's about the best you can do for you.
58,34,A few things I'm interested in:
68,34,You know how the USA works?
70,34,"> I don't even want to make this sound like a good news story. The world has moved on from the world without vaccines, and a lot of people..."
73,34,"I can't help myself but hate it. I'm a very sensitive person, and I'm not a big fan of the government. But I don't care how they talk about the virus, I care about the health and safety of my own health. It's really not what they should be doing."
74,34,I'm a kid who wears a mask to protect me from some kind of flu-like virus. I don't want to be the part of someone who has to deal with a virus with no protection at all.
81,34,I can't find it if you read the title of this post. It's not that I'm asking for answers. You are not being sarcastic.
82,34,It's in the 'Drugs and Drugs for You' list of all the things to do with the fecal virus vaccine.
93,34,"I've been to all the santas and the moon, and every one of them seems to be in some sort of a funk."
34,4,I'm in a similar situation.
34,9,Is this a reference to a book?
34,15,It's like a joke to some people with a virus who is scared of getting infected by a giant flying avian and then going to the airport with a man on his shoulders with a mask.
34,21,You ain't gonna help anyone. What's your favorite holiday to wear?
34,23,The article talks about how infecting a person with a virus would be different from getting a vaccine.
35,34,"""I wear a mask on my nose and nose every day. I’m in an uncomfortable environment and I can’t handle going out with my friends or family and they might think I’m a jerk."""
49,34,Are you a guy? You know you need to be at a med school.
58,34,I think the CDC needs to address this?
68,34,The way I feel is that when people are wearing a mask I don't have a problem with that. It's because I'm not the one that makes them feel uncomfortable. It is because they don't have the power to make them feel good.
70,34,"What's funny is that, a million people still wear a mask and that's enough karma for the government to continue their efforts."
73,34,"> The guy was clearly very misled and misled by the people, as you have shown."
74,34,"You just started listening to a new episode of ""Flexisexual Senses""."
81,34,What's the point of this?
82,34,>the fecal vaccine is one of the most harmful diseases in the world.
93,34,You have a lot of options but do you have the time? Because I guess you can't.
34,4,"[NAME]: We are the government, and all of our citizens."
34,9,This is not a good question.
34,15,">The guy was clearly very misled and misled by the people, as you have shown. You have a lot of options but do you have the time? Because I guess you can't."
34,21,"I've worn a mask for a while, but since I've been out there I still wear a mask. I mean you're being facetious, because this seems like an extreme case of getting the wrong kind of medicine at a very different time. You're getting that way too fast. This guy is a dick, right?"
34,23,>wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
35,34,"It's not a joke. It's a joke. The whole point of a joke is to just say, ""Oh you wear a mask because I like to wear it on my nose and nose every day."""
49,34,I am not sure how I should react to this.
58,34,Wearing a mask helps prevent the spread of the virus. It helps to make people aware that there are ways to stop it. Unlike using a mask to help prevent it.
68,34,"This is so ironic. There is an old joke where the people that wear a mask have to be vaccinated and the government doesn't like wearing masks because the people who wear them are apathetic. I can understand the idea, but I think the snide comments on this sub are coming from people who don't have a lot of self respect."
70,34,> Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the US government.
73,34,"It's a problem that was not supposed to arise. There's a law that requires it to have a federal mask mandate, which will not be used to protect against HIV."
74,34,I just can't understand why a doctor in my state said something stupid to you.
81,34,I think the problem here is that the movie is too long and you really need to take a break from that.
82,34,">Hey, I'm trying to find a way to help people in my community with the first one and the second one, I'm going to ask you what the big issue is in the first place. ""Making a mask is a great way to stop people from getting sick. Wearing a mask or wearing a helmet would save lives."""
93,34,"I've been to all the santas and the moon, and every one of them seems to be in some sort of funk. I think it's a rip off. Like a movie or a fable. I think this movie is funny. I've been to all the santas and the moon, and every one of them seems to be in some sort of funk. I think the santa joke is incredibly accurate, especially considering the fact that you implying that the face of santa could be a virus is"
34,4,I have a mask and I don't think it would be possible for me to wear a mask for work...
34,9,"I've been to all the santas and the moon, and every one of them seems to be in some sort of funk. I think the santa joke is incredibly accurate, especially considering the fact that you implying that the face of santa could be a virus is a joke. I think the santa joke is incredibly accurate, especially considering the fact that you implying that the face of santa could be a virus is a joke."
34,15,"If you want a funny and original joke about that and you're like, ""I'm not even going to use the word fucking."" then I say the best thing you can do is go see an actual movie about that."
34,21,This guy is the shit that will cause an explosion of cancer in your body.
34,23,"There is a story on here somewhere: a man has been sick since he was 16 and has an actual virus. The government is not interested in giving people the information that the human body needs in order to get vaccines to help people, so he is not going to make such a joke."
35,34,"A lot of people wear masks to make people feel better about themselves, especially in the context of public exposure, so it makes sense that someone is saying something like, ""But I think it's really not that stupid to say you should wear a mask because I like to wear it on my nose and nose every day."""
49,34,>I'm actually a doctor in the U.S. and I don't wear a mask in public anymore. I'm sure it's funny but also not funny at all. I don't understand why it's funny. I've heard that if the CDC sucks it'll be a very serious problem for us Americans.
58,34,"The idea of wearing a mask is based on a false alarm. It's not a health issue, it's a medical treatment that will prevent the spread of a symptom of a disease. It's not a health issue, it's a medical treatment that will prevent the spread of a virus."
68,34,"There aren't enough good people to get vaccinated for a virus, and there are not enough people to have their heads checked."
70,34,I don't see the difference in the two parts here. Vaccination is a medicine and a warning sign. The only difference is that it's the only way to protect people from getting sick versus not vaccinating them.
73,34,This ad is coming from a Texan. It seems like the whole Texan thing is so big that it needs to be explained.
74,34,"It sounds like a joke, but it's a joke."
81,34,...a lot of kids still think it's a great idea. It might be a little too easy to jar a child into the conversation and start to come off as too naive. The only thing that matters in a joke is that it's not a joke because the title is... not snide. It's a joke because it's not snide. It's a joke because it's not snide because it's too easy to put an end to it.
82,34,"[As a doctor, I can say this: The government isn't doing anything. I think a lot of people are thinking the NSA has ""done that""."
93,34,"A fable or a movie might actually do something interesting. I don't want to be sarcastic if I haven't seen it, and I can't be sarcastic."
34,4,It's not funny at all....because it's not really funny at all.
34,9,I think the idea is ridiculous to imply that all of the masks in the CDC would do more to prevent more people from getting sick?
34,15,"I don't think it is funny to say that the idea of wearing a mask is based on a false alarm. It's a medicine and a warning sign.

The only thing that matters in a joke is that it's not a health issue, and"
34,21,I've gotta look up how to make a joke and the internet.
34,23,"That's pretty ridiculous, and essentially the best way to find a solution."
35,34,"I don't think I've ever heard the phrase ""Mask"" before, I just don't know it. Rather, a funny joke, they've written it."
49,34,I am not sure how to respond to the entire sentence because I don't follow it. I just read the title and thought this was funny.
58,34,Wearing a mask helps to make people aware that there are ways to stop it. Unlike using a mask to help prevent it. Wearing a mask helps to make people aware that there are ways to stop it. Unlike using a mask to help prevent it.
68,34,I'm a little ashamed I don't want to be the cyborg shitjob in this country because I'm sick of him in the office.
70,34,It is actually a joke. The CDC will be willing to do more to combat the spread of the virus. It's just a joke.
73,34,> The man is a pedophile. He's not even on the statewide mask mandate.
74,34,"Vaccines are not what the government wants. We have more than 1000 vaccines, and those people should take that into account when planning an emergency response."
81,34,You're being a dick.
82,34,You’re actually going to be very much on the wrong side of the political spectrum here. You aren’t a political figure.
93,34,"> I'm not a santa or a clown. I don't like the way the movie ends, nor the characters, or the acting, but I think I am right about this."
34,4,"If you want to be humorous, wear a mask. If you don't, you don't need one. If you don't, it's okay. But if you don't want to be funny, don't."

34,15,"So, this guy is probably an NSA guy?"
34,21,"He's got some pretty serious vaccine issues on him and it will be in his best interest to have him in that CDC. Apparently he can't be a pedophile and therefore isn't a good vaccine. He is a pedophile, he is a pedophile. And if he ever is exposed to the disease and gets into a sick spot, he is going to have a vaccinated vaccine in the near future. That's not the worst possible way of defending the idea as in the story of how"
34,23,/r/theapartheid
35,34,The way this is being phrased is absurd.

58,34,"[NAME] I don't know what you mean by the'masked pigeon' part. I'm not sure about the'masked pigeon' part, but I think the government should be more open about this, but it should also be a statement that I'm a big pigeon snobby."
68,34,I feel like I'm being sarcastic here because I'm not sure how I'm supposed to be treated at my job. And then a few days later I went home and realised I was a child of a cyborg guy. But I didn't get any treatment. So I went to an AMA. I'm getting a mask for my kids. I'm afraid I just messed it up for my mother. I want them to be healthy and I'm not getting the sarcastic or offensive joke.
70,34,Yes. Vaccination is a medical treatment and a warning sign. Vaccination is a medicine and a warning sign.
73,34,"""(As a doctor, I can say that he is a doctor, not a politician. But I'm saying that they need to go and look at this more, or else they will become more violent."""
74,34,"If a nhsw doctor doesn't know how to vaccinate you, you should report it to the CDC a few weeks later. That's what is called a joke in many jurisdictions - a vaccine doesn't work if you have a health insurance policy in place."

34,23,"The problem is that in the US it is a federal law that prevents a man from vaccinating himself by wearing masks. I see no reason to think otherwise, and I'm just trying to make this clear - I'm not a politician and I don't like being portrayed as a funny or funny person."
35,34,"So what you said to me was, ""You know, I'm going to look at the mask again. What you've said to me is not the kind of joke you're going to think about me being asked. I'm not sure why a lot of people don't think this is funny."

74,34,I'm confused on why you have the excuse for not liking the idea of the mask in the first place. It's silly.
81,34,This isn't a joke. This is a joke. It's not a joke.
82,34,The biggest issue isn't the mask. The problem is the mask is not needed.

34,9,He's a big egotistical slob who's got some good ideas that are not necessarily relevant to the subject. This is an interesting way to look at things and see the facts.
34,15,"This is going to be a real discussion and the way I see it, I'll go ahead and explain what I'm thinking. I'm afraid I don't get why people hate the NSA. I just don't get why they would want to be in the public domain."
34,21,"I’m not really sure what is even an actual ad, but a lot of people wear masks to prevent an epidemic. The joke is that it’s supposed to help fight infection, not the disease."
34,23,I'm a doc and have never done any of these things and don't understand what the meaning is of a mask. There is no actual context to it other than that a man could have a virus. He was just looking for some explanation that he didn't like.
35,34,I feel so bad for my husband and I because I know the CDC doesn't want to do that. I'm not sure what I want to do about it.
49,34,"In a country with so much violence, this joke doesn't even have to be joke. It's a joke."
58,34,I'm in Florida so I don't know if I'm right. I have never been the victim of a TB vaccine.
68,34,Vaccination is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.AMA is what happens when a patient comes in contact with the government.
70,34,"""I think it's okay for you to keep being dubbed the ""I don't wear a mask in public"" as the title implies? Vaccination isn't a joke, but it is a warning sign.

The only difference is that it's the only way to protect people from getting sick versus not vaccinating them."" ""I think it's okay for you to keep being dubbed the ""I don't wear a mask in public"""
73,34,"That's one thing, it seems, it is completely untrue."
74,34,The joke isn't funny because of the fact that they have the power to stop the spread of a virus. The CDC isn't responsible for preventing the spread of a virus. It's useless and useless.
81,34,The word is still a joke. It's a joke because it's not a joke.
82,34,Affirmative action is a major part of any healthcare reform.
93,34,"I've been to the santas and the moon, and they seem to be in some sort of funk. I think the movie is a rip off. Like a movie or a fable. I think this movie is funny."
34,4,"I believe the CDC is making a huge mistake by discrediting ""McDavids"" and making them look like ""a joke"". Thats what the ""McDavids"" ad is about. The CDC, and not the CDC."
34,9,I can't stop thinking about it.
34,15,The movie is not going to be funny. The movie just has a bit of a tv show that has been on the air for years. This isn't a tv show.
34,21,"This has become a topic of discussion. In the context of the CDC, the CDC has also announced that it's working to keep the CDC from recommending vaccines on people."
34,23,"I feel like I'm at the top of a stack of shit, as is the rest of Reddit."
35,34,"I feel like a lot of people are trying to explain it in a way they don't understand. I don't even know if you're joking, I'm just saying I've learned a lot from those comments."
49,34,This is how it was always considered a joke.
58,34,It's not funny that people get mad because their masks are putting on a virus. Vaccines are not just a gimmick. They are supposed to help people get a little safer. Vaccines are not just a routine thing. There are other things you can do in the United States that help. Vaccines are for life. Vaccines are not just a gimmick. They are supposed to help people get a little safer. Vaccines are supposed to help people get a little safer.
68,34,I feel like this is all about the joke.
70,34,It's a joke because it is a warning sign. The only difference is that it's the only way to protect people from getting sick versus not vaccinating them.
73,34,">the problem is that a mask is actually something that the government can do and does not need to be done to stop the spread of AIDS. In a nutshell, the problem with the mask is that it's actually something that the government can do and does not need to be done to stop the spread of AIDS."
74,34,"This is ridiculous. Just because the CDC isn't responsible for preventing the spread of a virus, doesn't mean it isn't a joke."

82,34,"So - if you had a face mask, the government would want you to wear one?...."
93,34,The only way to be funny is to read and take one second to go on and watch the movie. I wouldn't do that. The only way to understand it is that it's a ripoff of the book.
34,4,"I'm going to go on with my work for a while now. I've seen plenty of rape and ebola on tv as I've been to so many places. But that's just me, so I have to say I know I've heard this a few times."
34,9,"Affirmative action is a major part of any healthcare reform. I've been to the santas and the moon, and they seem to be in some sort of funk. I think the joke is incredibly accurate."
34,15,So basically the entire concept of a mask is inherently a ripoff of the book.
34,21,"Vaccines are supposed to help fight infection, not the disease."
34,23,We have a lot of different ways to use vaccines. This is not funny in itself. The issue of a mask and the effect of a masked pigeon on a child with a virus is the same. There isn't much they can do. The people in this thread are in a funk because it's not funny. That's why a joke like this is a joke.
35,34,"Wearing a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.I think it's a joke, a joke, but not a joke. The movie is a joke."

68,34,AMAs - the snide ones.
70,34,"There's no ""everyone should wear a mask"" in public, it's just that a mask is a necessity for protection from the spread of a virus."
73,34,"Its not legal. Its just the fact that people feel admonishing them. People who wear masks are promoting a disease they aren't comfortable with, and they can't actually stop it."
74,34,"I don't think it's a joke, though it's funny to see people wearing the same mask every month."
81,34,"It's a joke, because it's a joke, and because the humor is an important thing for it."
82,34,"I would say ""I wish more people had the opportunity to explain what the government is doing IANAL, but i do not think the government is concerned with the effect of such a mandate."""
93,34,I'm not a fan of it either but I like it.

73,34,The CDC does not have funding for a new statewide mask mandate. There is no funding for it.
74,34,Vaccination is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. This is a very generalised version of the joke.

35,34,"We need to learn a bit more about this. The guy was saying that a CDC AMA - 'Making people feel better about themselves is a joke, but not a joke'. I thought he was referring to an article from a CDC staffer who recently got vaccinated for the flu. They weren't even trying to show that the AMA is about the CDC. They were attempting to make the vaccines mandatory to people that didn't get it. They aren't doing anything about that. Hopefully, the message is"

I don’t want to be the part of someone who has to deal with a virus with no protection at all.” joke in general seems like a really good idea unless you mean “I don’t like wearing a mask because I can’t stand wearing it.” joke is just that: “I don’t like the idea of a medical mask, but I can’t understand why a doctor in my state said something stupid to me"
81,34,"No, this isn't a joke. A joke. It's a joke. A joke."
82,34,I don't think there is any real political issue here.
93,34,"It's a good joke, and a ripoff of the book. The reason you put a 'fucking santa face on a narcotic' in a movie is because of the movie's description. This isn't a ripoff of the book, but a joke that the movie is based on."

34,21,"It doesn't make sense that a new ACA isn't in effect yet, but a few years ago it came into effect. The AMA is supposed to be about the government attempting to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS, and the CDC is trying to help prevent that, but it's a joke."

58,34,"The AMA is a joke, and the joke is not about vaccines. The movie is about a comedy film about the cyborgs that will spread the virus."
68,34,I think the best way to explain it is to 'help out' with the people that are trying to get them out of the health care system.
70,34,"""I don't get it at all."""
73,34,[I don't think they can send that funding to the CDC because they don't have funding for a new statewide mask mandate.''

35,34,A lot of people are going to make fun of the government if they don't get vaccinated. I'm a doctor and I think it's a good idea to have a doctor in your company that doesn't have to go to the hospital.
49,34,"It's an insult, it's not funny, and it's not a joke. AMAs aren't jokes, they're just comments."

73,34,"You're right that the CDC is inherently unpopular with the right people. It seems like this issue isn't a problem, it's a problem. It is not a problem because it's a problem because of the way they handle the issue."
74,34,It's a joke. Vaccination is a combination of medication and therapy to help stop the spread of a virus.
81,34,What's the point of wearing a mask in front of a TV in a movie if you know how to use it?
82,34,"It is a joke. I'd say just don't wear a mask. Wearing a mask doesn't mean you have to take off your protective gear outside if you want to do so. The more you go on, the more oblivious you are to it. It doesn't work."
93,34,The book is about santas.
34,4,You need to hear the joke. You don't need to hear it.

You seem to be saying that they can't get rid of the CDC, and that's the problem with them."
74,34,Vaccination is a combination of medication and therapy to help stop the spread of a virus.
81,34,I don't know if you understand what is going on in these paragraphs. But as in I know you're not a doctor. You just look at the title and you feel like there is a joke.
82,34,The problem is not the mask. It's the message of the vaccine that should not be pushed into our public view by people who do not want to take the risk of getting sick.
93,34,There is a ripoff of the book.
34,4,Vaccination is a combination of medication and therapy to stop the spread of a virus. What's the point of wearing a mask in front of a TV in a movie if you know how to use it?

58,34,"I think the biggest issue in the movie is people who get a t-zone, get sick or have a heart attack and feel like they have a sicker t-zone. The first thing people say when they start to think about a t-zone is that they want to stop, and the second thing they think about is not coming out to stop. The third thing that comes to mind is the fact that people wear their masks so they aren't being sick."
68,34,"Well, it's the government that's doing it. This is the government that's trying to stop the spread of a virus."
70,34,Is there anything funny about that?
73,34,"In my state, a mask is considered a statewide, but hasn't been legally required to protect against HIV."
74,34,"I can see where you're coming from. There are a ton of other things to consider here, but I'm curious as to why they don't have vaccines that work."
81,34,I can't even say what's a joke unless I have the courage to say it. This kind of joke is just a joke and they say the truth.
82,34,"AMA is about the government, the CDC, the worlds population. What kind of joke is it, and why do you think they shouldn't be using masks? Are they being used as a means of protecting someone's health? I'd say it's pretty obvious."
93,34,I think this joke is incredibly accurate. Like a movie or a fable.
34,4,"A few things to consider. Its not funny at all, it's a joke."
34,9,The idea of a ripoff is a ripoff. The joke isn't. I just think the CDC should give people a chance to prove that they're trying to prevent a CDC disease through vaccines. They're going to go into a funk.
34,15,I really don't know how I understand the CIA's 'hilarity' with the NSA...
34,21,As you said in the article.
34,23,"The thing about the masked pigeon and vaccines is it was just a joke. It's not funny that people wear them, they're just a joke, that they're just a joke."
35,34,You are being insulted. And I'm not going to argue with you. This isn't a joke. It's a joke. It's not a joke. It's a joke. But it's not a joke.
49,34,"I've had a few people in my life get sick of AIDS. I've had a few autoimmune diseases that I've never had a disease, and I've never had a disease I didn't have an infectious disease. They're just as bad as a joke in the US. Having a disease causes sickness and is the same thing with all the other things in the world. I have been vaccinated for a few years and have not had any problem with my symptoms if you've heard about this."

73,34,"This isn't illegal, I think you guys are being silly."
74,34,You're a fool for being an adult.
81,34,"It sounds like a joke, to me."
82,34,The answer to this question is the same as OP's comment. It’s not an AMA.
93,34,I don't think the author was being sarcastic.
34,4,"""Making a mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. I can see where you're coming from. There are a ton of other things to consider here, but I'm curious as to why they don't have vaccines that work."""

34,15,I feel like they're being very clear about their motives when they're able to make a joke out of it. I'd put it down to the NSA's lack of awareness of their work and a lack of awareness to prevent them from trying to get vaccines.
34,21,"> The joke is that it’s supposed to help fight infection, not the disease.'"
34,23,What's the'real' meaning of a joke?
35,34,A mask is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.
49,34,"I was just putting this in front of a lot of people, so I'm going to look up the AMA. You haven't asked me for anything."
58,34,AMA? I don't have the resources to make one. That's why they give AMAs. That they provide AMAs. There is no sexist stuff on this sub.
68,34,"It's not a joke, but it is a joke and it isn't a good example of what's going on here."

81,34,"That's a very good joke. You know, I was born with a nose and a big mouth when I was little. I thought that was a joke. Then I realized what I was saying: it's just a joke."
82,34,"I would think the most obvious problem is the mask, and the big issue is that people who don't have a helmet or the CDC don't use one."
93,34,"""I just don't like the way it ends, nor does it seem funny."""
34,4,Why would the CDC be allowed to wear the mask?
34,9,"As others have said, I think people like it because the author is trying to use sexist rhetoric in their AMA."
34,15,I think you're making the wrong impression here. A CDC AMA is just a ripoff of the book.
34,21,Are you a doctor? A doctor is the first person person to understand that a pedophile's sexuality is a risk factor for a pt.
34,23,"It's not funny. It's a joke, and not a joke."

58,34,"You know, this sub is basically a joke for a lot of different reasons. There's a lot of bad humor. People are stupid."
68,34,It is just a joke. People are prone to being infected if they're wearing a mask in public.

74,34,Vaccines are not what the government wants. It's an incentivization thing to talk about the government. It's an attempt to make fun of the government.
81,34,No one should be going on a date with a kid who wants to get vaccinated. Especially if they don't know what a joke is and are afraid to give them it.
82,34,"AMA is a bit of a troll joke, but not a real one at all."
93,34,I would go to any movie and make my own. I'm more interested in bringing something like the movie to an audience with whom I enjoy a lot.
34,4,"""We are the government, and all of our citizens."
34,9,"""Wait, are you being a dick. 'Cannot understand how this guy is a pedophile. He was clearly very misled and misled by the people, as you have shown.... I don't care how they talk about the virus, I care about the health and safety of my own health. It's really not what they should be doing."""
34,15,OP is missing the nato memo.
34,21,Why are a lot of people still using a mask in the ACA? What is the reason for this?
34,23,It's a joke and not a joke.
35,34,I'm a doctor.
49,34,"I grew up in the south and I've known a lot of people who have died of a different type of disease. My mom's brother died of a stroke. My mom has been vaccinated. I've had a lot of illnesses that were due to the CDC's shaming, I was not aware of the CDC."
58,34,"It is a joke because the CDC isn't in charge of that, and there's a lot of bad humor."
68,34,"It's not funny, it's funny. It's the best thing that we have a right to feel if we don't have any personal information, and it's the joke."
70,34,"I don't see how that is funny at all. That's funny. That's a joke. The CDC is trying to make a joke out of something a lot of people didn't know about. The phrase is ""We don't have to wear a mask to help stop the spread of the deadly virus."""
73,34,What’s the problem with the ad? That the CDC doesn’t actually have to use that? Why isn’t it illegal for them to just do a mask?
74,34,I'm not familiar with this so I'll give it a try.
81,34,"I'm sorry you have to read that in the past. I'm not saying it's a joke. I'm saying that it's a good idea, and one that I should be able to put on a mask in order to keep from spreading viruses. I'm saying that it's a joke because it's a joke. I'm trying to make a joke that's not a joke. Is that all I'm doing wrong?"
82,34,This is a bit egregious.
93,34,"I'd wear a mask and run around. I can tell it's a joke, it's a joke, and it's actually a bit of an incredibly ripoff of a book."
34,4,"I'm a nurse, and I wear a mask and I don't think it's funny. If you think it's funny you need to find out what it is about. If it's not a joke, then there is a pretty big problem with the ad."
34,9,It's a joke because the author ripped off a book. He just threw it around in a comedy.
34,15,I would be surprised if there was an AMA on tv that wasn't on the topic.
34,21,"It's not really a joke, it's just that it's ridiculous to use a mask to have a joke in the context of a policy that requires it. The fact that a CDC official said it would be against the law because it's not illegal in Texas is a little disingenuous. The CDC also is trying to get people to wear a mask to prevent the spread of the virus."
34,23,It's a 'joke'. It's a joke.
35,34,"It's called the ""Mask"" in English."
49,34,"AMAs aren't jokes, they're just comments."
58,34,"Basically it's the idea of a mask to prevent people from getting infected because people can't do it themselves and are putting their hands on the ground and not doing their job. In other words, they want to help and they want people to get more safe."
68,34,"It is not a joke, it is a joke."
70,34,"The joke is the one where ""I can see a little bit of the difference between me and the other person"", 'If you get sick, I'll have a cough and I have a headache, I won't have a cough'."
73,34,You can get the government to revert to a more fair and more acceptable treatment of HIV-related diseases.
74,34,"I mean, if a doctor is not familiar with the joke, they can't help you with the joke."
81,34,I'd say that I found it hilarious. I think the answer is that this is the best way to explain it. I'm not really sure about what exactly that is implying.
82,34,"AMAs have to be done in a public forum where the subject is ""Shocking: CDC, the government, and our health professionals are working on what is necessary to stop spread of a virus. AMAs about fecal virus vaccines and their effects are not being put into public view"" are not jokes. AMAs are about putting people at risk of getting sick and bringing attention to a very serious and ridiculous topic."
93,34,"I didn't know the OP was referencing the movie as the ""relatively new"" slant."
34,4,"In this AMA, the author of the ad calls it ""the CDC ripped off the book, ebola has spread everywhere."" It explains what they are trying to do, and it's not just an AMA about a CDC thing."
34,9,"This has to be a joke and it isn't going to be a ripoff in the right circumstances. It isn't a joke because it isn't on the books OP's AMA, but it has to be a joke."
34,15,"no, I'm just joking about being an affront to the NSA ad. I have no problem saying it's a joke, and I'd rather be able to say it's a joke than it's a ripoff of the book?"
34,21,>If I think it's funny you need to find out what it is about. It's a joke because the author ripped off a book. He just threw it around in a comedy.
34,23,I was referring to the problem of the CDC's policy that keeps people infected and to the fact that it's impossible to stop them from wearing the mask.
35,34,"I mean, I would just have to be nice to someone who didn't have to wear them because they were trying to force them to get vaccinated."
49,34,"It's really a joke, but people don't know what it's about."
58,34,"There's a very high rate of anti-vaccine jokes on this sub, the most of which come from people who don't know anything about tb."
68,34,I don't think the person he said was a patriot and was a patriot.
70,34,"As I was speaking from personal experience, I think that a very interesting piece of evidence is that the article implies the person who is in need of vaccines wears the mask that he or she has got the vaccine."
73,34,I'm not a big fan of the government but I don't think it is something that should be illegal.
74,34,"“We all know about your illness, but I don’t want to be part of the joke.”"
81,34,"I think they’re trying to make fun of the problem, and then make fun of them in other ways. They’re trying to make fun of the problem but don’t."
82,34,"AMAs aren't jokes. They're about the government, the CDC, and the worlds population. What kind of joke is it? ""Why do you think they shouldn't be using masks?"
93,34,There is also a little story of the Xmas party and the one where a troll robbed him while driving around on a train. One of the characters was a ghost from the original film. He thought it was good. The others are great too.

34,21,That is how the AMA is supposed to be done.
34,23,"The problem of masks is that if you're 'as an AMA' in a public forum, the most relevant part is getting all the AMAs, and then telling that to the public, there's nothing about them."
35,34,Its not a joke. Its a joke. Its a joke. Its a joke because it's funny. Its a joke because it's funny.
49,34,There are AMAs on r/religiousjokes. It’s a naive and stupid joke. They’re aimed at the public and it’s not to keep people from having their health impacted by the CDC.
58,34,"I don't think the government is obligated to stop spread of a disease, they are trying to make people aware of it."
68,34,I don't see why you would think that a joke would be funny because it's not a joke.

73,34,"It is a joke about how government, not only are treating people, but also how people think it is wrong to tell the truth by telling people the truth. There are so many problems with that."
74,34,It's a joke because it makes people feel better.
81,34,"I’m sorry, but that movie is fucked up and I can’t get a copy of the movie."
82,34,AMAs are about putting people at risk of getting sick and bringing attention to a very serious and ridiculous topic.
93,34,The first sentence of the paragraph was kind of sarcastic. I think the only way to understand it is that it's a ripoff of the book. It's a ripoff of the book.
34,4,P.S. : [in [English] (http://www.sc.gov/news_afra/news_afra/news_afra/news_afra.html).
34,9,"That's one of the things I've found so fun, and it's not about the fucked up book, it's about the ridiculous sexist joke and the real part that's hilarious."
34,15,That's a good thing you know. If you read the AMA that's been posted here before... you're not trying to be funny.
34,21,You've already learned a valuable lesson.

35,34,The joke isn't funny. It's just one of those things that you tell people a few times.
49,34,"I think the jokes are aimed at the public because they're about the government, not the government."
58,34,I want to apologize and say that I'm just being a fucking moron. I'm sure it's fun that some people will think this isn't a joke or something.
68,34,AMA is about how the government is trying to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS.
70,34,The CDC is trying to make the point that they should not be doing this is not a joke.
73,34,The fact that it's a joke seems to be a good sign that the government is doing something wrong.
74,34,"I think the best way to put it is to mention that there is a heightened risk of the illness happening, but the problem is that it's not enough to prevent the spread."
81,34,"Having a clone of the government is a fucking joke, and it's not the best way to put it. This is a joke. I have no idea what it is. I think it is the best way to explain it. I'm not really sure what the joke is, just that I think it's funny."
82,34,There are two parts of the question:
93,34,This isn't a ripoff of the book. The santa is a ripoff of the book.
34,4,The article is about the government trying to stop the spread of ebola. This is about how it's a joke.
34,9,It's not a ripoff of the book. It's a joke. It isn't funny. It's a ripoff of the book.
34,15,"'Peasant, I'm not a patriot.'"
34,21,"I'd say the CDC is using a lot of evidence to establish that there is a problem with the CDC in the USA, and that this is going to be a huge problem."
34,23,It's a joke.
35,34,It isn't a joke. It is a joke. It's just a joke. It isn't a joke.
49,34,"I know they're a joke but the point of the joke is to tell people that the government is trying to help. The joke is about the government trying to stop the spread of a virus. People don't know what a joke is. People don't know what a joke is. The whole idea of a ""fecal vaccine"" in the military is not very good, in fact, it's bad."
58,34,You got the jokes. You got the jokes. You got the jokes. You got the jokes. You got the jokes. You got the jokes. You got the jokes. You got the jokes. You got the jokes. You got the jokes. You got the jokes. You got the jokes. You got the jokes. You got the jokes. You got the jokes. You got the jokes. You got the jokes. You got the jokes. You got the jokes. You got a joke.
68,34,"I’m sure the AMA was a very serious joke, but it lasted almost ten minutes and it wasn’t actually intended to be a joke."
70,34,"I don't get why people downvote things, but I don't get why people downvote. You are being an asshole here. The article isn't a joke. They're just trying to make the government look stupid and bad. They're just trying to make the government look stupid and bad. They're just trying to make the government look stupid and bad."
73,34,They don't do a mask to stop the spread of HIV. A mask is a way to protect people. The government is trying to rework it for the same reason the CDC is trying to prevent HIV and keep that kind of coverage alive for people without it.
74,34,[[Teenager's Guide to Vaccination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenager_Guide_to_Vaccination_As_Ancient_Guide_of_Vaccination_As_Ancient_Guide_to_Preventing_The Spread of a Viral Disease)
81,34,Nope. That's a joke.
82,34,There is a problem that is not a joke. You can say it is a joke but not a joke at all.
93,34,"... I know... there is a good joke on it, but the'sarcasm' is not exactly the one I 'd' like to get, it's that I'd'really' enjoy it."
34,4,Are you a patriot? They’re going to fuck up your workplace.
34,9,>The whole idea of a ripoff of the book. The santa is a ripoff of the book. The santa is a ripoff of the book.
34,15,"What's the meaning of the word ""fake""?"
34,21,"It's funny that we are going to get a bunch of people complaining about rape and ebola in our country, and this article has a lot of rambling about how a mask should help stop the spread of the disease, and a number of people talking about the fact that people are being abused and abused in their community - that a mask will help."
34,23,The US has been a joke lately.
35,34,"I want to go to a doctor and say something like ""If we put that on you in public I'm gonna go into a hospital and see if we have to take your advice and do something about this. So i am going to ask you some questions, then we could go to a doctor and see what your next steps are in the process of doing this."
49,34,I am a doctor a few years ago. I am at a high school and a great teacher. I love to listen to the doctors.
58,34,"What I mean is, it's not a joke that people want to go to the doctor to find the cause of a bacterial infection, but rather that the people who use vaccines are not a good person to do it for."
68,34,I think the best way to explain it is to 'help out' with the people that are trying to get them out of the health care system.
70,34,I don't have a good memory of when that happened. It was one of those things that I listened to a lot when I was younger.
73,34,It's not illegal to wear a mask in a state that does not have Medicaid funding for statewide coverage. It's a joke to rape you for the money they're sending a fucking kid.
74,34,If you're sick you should get a new mask to protect you and I think it could be a joke.
81,34,> I don't understand what is going on in these paragraphs.
82,34,"You're right. I like to have a joke in public, but in a way that will make people think they have a better life. I'm going to tell you, as well as what's going on, that this is an example of an AMA that's not a joke. What's an AMA about? Why are these people talking about the AMA? The joke is a joke."
93,34,So I thought I was being sarcastic... but that's a bit odd to you.
34,4,What's the point of a mask in front of a TV? Isn't it a joke?
34,9,>I think the question here is: do people like it?
34,15,The joke is not a joke. The NSA is a troll posing as a threat to the US health care system. I think it's a joke.
34,21,We've seen plenty of rape and ebola on TV.
34,23,It's a joke because the CDC is a joke because they are not helping the epidemic of HIV/AIDS in the USA.
35,34,"I'm the one that thinks that ""It's a joke, but not a joke."""
49,34,"This is one of the most dangerous things in the world. It makes the person on the street more likely to die from something they don't actually think about, and makes it harder for the person to find out. Vaccines are a joke."
58,34,"I would probably make a pretty big joke about it, but I would also probably write about it like this: ""Feeling sick, but I don't understand it."""
68,34,It’s the most important thing that we have to do to stop the spread of HIV in this country.
70,34,Vaccination is a medicine and a warning sign. The only difference is that it is the only way to protect people from dying and getting sick. The only difference is that it is the only way to protect people from dying and getting sick. The only difference is that it is the only way to protect people from dying and getting sick. The only difference is that it is the only way to protect people from dying and getting sick. The only difference is that it is the only way to protect people from dying and getting sick.
73,34,>The only problem I have with the government is that people will become more violent if they don't wear them.
74,34,"As an american, I am in denial. I don't know about it."
81,34,"I don't like the name of the comment. It doesn't sound like a joke. I would say it sounds like a joke, and not a joke, but that it's a good joke and makes the point that it's not a joke."
82,34,I'd be a little skeptical of the joke.
93,34,I'm not a fan of the movie. I just don't like it and I don't like the movie.
34,4,What's a joke?
34,9,"I think the 'twice in a million times' in ""the whole idea of a ripoff of the book. It's a joke."
34,15,The CIA is making fun of their employees. It is so disgusting to me. The government is making fun of them.
34,21,Vaccination is a joke. Its a joke because the NSA is a troll posing as a threat to the US health care system.
34,23,Those are just a few jokes. They're the jokes that everyone else thinks.
35,34,"So, the point of the joke is to get a guy to think a funny joke isn't a joke. It's a joke. It's a joke, because the joke isn't a joke. It's a joke because it's a joke. The joke is a joke, because it's a joke."
49,34,AMAs aren’t jokes. They’re just comments. It’s a joke.
58,34,">""People say ''You guys got a t-zone and you get a t-zone, you need to get a t-zone and you get a t-zone. Because that's how people ''wrap the t-zone in the first place""',"""
68,34,AMA's are about the government's attempt to stop the spread of HIV.
70,34,The jokes themselves are going to be stupid.
73,34,"This is a joke. This is not a joke, it is a joke."
74,34,Because they use medical masks to prevent the spread of the virus.
81,34,"I read that, it sounds like a joke. Having a clone of the government is a joke."
82,34,"'As a doctor, I can say this: The government isn't doing anything. I think a lot of people are thinking the NSA has ""done that"".', ""You’re actually going to be very much on the wrong side of the political spectrum here. You aren’t a political figure."""

34,9,"It's not a joke, it's a joke, it's a joke."
34,15,You have no idea what this is about.
34,21,Vaccination is a joke. Its a joke because the CDC is a troll posing as a threat to the US health care system.
34,23,"There is no real problem. It's not a joke, and it's a joke. It's a joke, and it's a joke."
35,34,Isn't this the kind of person who gets a bunch of jokes about the fact that he has a friend who is a joke to everyone?
49,34,"I think it's a joke because the people I talk to who are just trying to tell jokes and AMAs have not made it a joke, and I think they are actually just jokes. The jokes themselves aren't a joke either."
58,34,I would rather a joke than a joke.
68,34,What kind of joke is it? What do you know about the AMA? Are there any other examples of AMAs about the AMA being made?
70,34,Why do people need to wear masks in the US when they are sick? Because it's not a good reason to wear a mask in the US?
73,34,I'm gonna go look into some more things about this with the other members of AMA.
74,34,"""Vaccines are not what the government wants. We have more than 1000 vaccines, and those people should take that into account when planning an emergency response."
81,34,"I'd tell my parents, if they're like ""It's a joke, because I think it's a joke"" (not that it's a joke) that it's a joke, then just stop making jokes about it."
82,34,> I thought it was funny AMA was about preventing the spread of HIV. There are many a jokes about being a doctor and being a politician.
93,34,"I've got the first four sentences in this post. It's called ""a rip off"" because it's an incredibly ripoff of the book that was written by a ripoff of a book. This is a great place to start a new week."
34,4,I know this is a joke.
34,9,It's a joke because the author was trying to be a ripoff of the book. The idea isn't as good as a ripoff of the book. The CDC is a troll posing as a threat to the US health care system.
34,15,I think the difference is that the actual CDC will be required to send someone to an AMA where you can get more info on the issues.
34,21,Are you a doctor? The doctor is a troll who claims to not be a doctor. You can make a joke based on the person you said.
34,23,"I'm a doctor, i work with people and they don't say what they feel. It's a joke that I have to go into detail about but that is not what the book is about."
35,34,"I think you should have done your own research on the topic. Vaccines are not an excuse to stop or prevent the spread of HIV, it's just a joke, as far as I can tell. It's a joke, because it's funny."
49,34,"As a former GP, I find it amusing that there are a lot of different jokes about the government and their shaming to the government. I'm surprised that this one doesn't get picked out as a joke in the US."
58,34,"Despite all of the horrible shit that it's caused by the AIDS epidemic, the AMA is one of the shitniest."
68,34,"It's funny, but it's not the kind of funny that's often referred to as a joke. The thing is that it's not the kind of joke that's referred to in the sub that seems like it has no idea what the word is in it."
70,34,What's funny is that I heard that the only people with allergies have to wear masks to protect themselves from the disease. It's just a joke.
73,34,"I was talking to a person, who was a doctor. A friend of mine, who was diagnosed with HIV when she was 12, was in the hospital after a long syphilis to help people. They were having the same thoughts but they did not know that the CDC is responsible for all of it."
74,34,It’s a joke and they’re making fun of people. I can’t even begin to think of any excuse why the government does not have vaccines that stop the spread of a virus.
81,34,"If it's just a joke and they have no idea what a joke is, then there is no point in going out there and trying to stop it. They're trying to make fun of the government. The government has a joke about the government trying to stop the spread of a virus."
82,34,No joke is a joke. What's the joke?
93,34,"OP's original comment in a ""Boy's Book"" thread was a joke. I would think you sarcastic, but then he would have called the book ""a ripoff"" of the book."

35,34,"i have a comma. i'm a comma. it's called a ""jake"" or ""a joke"""
49,34,I don't think the joke's funny. I'm a pretty conservative guy.
58,34,I figured this would be a joke. The AMA is an attempt to make people feel better and I don't see the joke as anything more than a joke.
68,34,The story is so amazing. I've never seen it.
70,34,Vaccination is a medicine and a warning sign. It is the only way to protect people from dying and getting sick.
73,34,"I know that the problem with using a mask is that they can't make it legal. I don't think that statewide mask mandates are a good idea, especially because they're going to go against the principles of the AMA. It's not like the AMA is about the AMA and it's not about what the AMA is about."

68,34,I don't think a joke is about a virus. It's a joke about a virus. It's a joke about how a virus is causing or spreading something. AMAs are generally the best way to describe a virus without saying something offensive or sarcastic.
70,34,"You could use the sentence, ""The problem with this is that it has no scientific basis. People want to protect their lives, and the CDC doesn't.
