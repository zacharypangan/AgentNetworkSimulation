92,83,"I was in a similar situation to mark, and he said he had been sick in the past. It was a joke that the government was putting up with."
93,83,">Hey, just got back from the run. I'm just gonna throw out that the cyborg costume was really cool. Obviously it's a joke, but I don't think it was funny. I like to think this is a good joke, but I don't think it's an awesome idea."
83,10,"No, they aren't."
83,11,I can see why the US government is causing a lot of problems.
83,14,"In that case I'm not going to wear a mask on my job, and I don't want to wear a mask in public."
83,15,>We are not legally required. and they are not required. Because I'm a man and I don't believe in the masked system. I am in Florida and I wear a mask.

83,20,"I thought this was a joke to the cyborg costume in the movie, but I think it was a joke for me. 'Bad jokes."
83,25,People are also putting up with this idea of being the only government to make it so. The government is in no position to prevent fapping of people. It's a joke.
83,46,"If you don't want to have to see a doctor, you need to wear a mask."
83,48,"I have to ask myself, why is this a joke?"

92,83,I am a lawyer and I don't even believe you are trying to justify the medical procedure of the medical doctor who is going to prescribe this to you.
93,83,"It makes me happy that a lot of people see me doing what is called a ""joke"" in the comics. I don't know who to ask, though. I've heard people complain that a guy wearing a mask on a run will make someone think he's an asshole."
83,10,This is a fairly common joke that people make on the internet because people are ignoring them in front of the camera.
83,11,I think there's a lot of things that the US government should be doing.
83,14,I read somewhere that they aren't required to make it to the health of people and they don't require you to wear a mask for the purpose of preventing the spread of a virus. It is a joke and they can't make it legal.
83,15,Obviously it's a joke. I think it's also a joke that the government is trying to avoid a dilution of a good joke.
83,19,"The joke is not actually a joke. Vaccines are legal, and there is no requirement for it. So if I wear a mask on a run, I will go get a hysterectomy."
83,20,"It's a joke, but it's a joke, and it isn't going to be something that you're going to get on a train. You're going to be getting some medical treatment or something, but you'll be able to go see a doctor or something. You don't even need a mask to stop the spread of a virus. That's just a joke. I don't see why the government is causing problems."
83,25,"Wearing a mask on a run is part of the measures deployed by the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus.It's actually a joke. I mean the government has some great policies that do the same thing. Like having to be in a hospital to go get some antibiotics or something. I would not want to wear a mask on my job, and I don't want to wear a mask in public."
83,46,"I'm sorry, but I don't think people should be allowed to make it into a ""joke."""
83,48,"It's a joke, and it's just like saying that you're a big fan of the government making a joke. It's not a joke."
83,60,Because the government doesn't want to have the health of their family protected.
83,71,They aren't legally required. They aren't legally required.
83,80,"""Always afraid of being faped"" is what some people call a joke. It's not true. And we don't, either. The country doesn't. I'm afraid. This is a joke."

92,83,"You lied to someone. Now, you have to reevaluate your health."
93,83,"I don't think people have anything in common with any of this. A racial comedy and a satire are a number of things that are common. It's a generality - a lot of people are ostracized by this or that, despite the fact that they're actually pretty funny, that's actually not even relevant to any given situation."
83,10,They're also saying the government does not want people to see him walk on a trail and do not want to get a mask and get antibiotics.
83,11,Vaccines are illegal. They don't.

83,46,"Yes, it's a joke and it's not a joke. You know a doctor would be able to prescribe it without going to a doctor."
83,48,"You're not the only one who thinks a joke is a joke. The fact that this guy is a huge fan of wearing a mask on a run is ridiculous. He was probably in a bad mood to see the fdr fighting his way into the hospital, and he didn't wear a mask on the bus, he's being run over by an actual fdr."
83,60,"The thing about a joke is that the ""joke"" is just a joke. They don't want to have the health of their family protected. They don't want to have the health of their family protected."
83,71,"Vaccines are illegal in a lot of countries. And yes, they are."
83,80,I've gotten a lot of reassurances on this post.
90,83,I know that's not a joke. The government can't stop a virus from spreading. I am a huge fan of wearing a mask in public.
92,83,"I can say a lot of what you said about a joke that makes you believe that vaccines are illegal because they have the potential to cause fatalities. Vaccines are dangerous, dangerous, dangerous, and have the potential to cause fatalities. Vaccines are not legally required unless you are a physician."
93,83,"IANAL. I've seen a lot of people who wear a mask on a daily basis, even when they do not feel safe with themselves. I've seen a lot of people who wear a mask on a daily basis, even when they do not feel safe with themselves. I'm just a guy who wears a mask every day. I've seen a lot of people who wear a mask on a daily basis, even when they do not feel safe with themselves."
83,10,"This is a joke, and it isn't even a joke. It is a joke. Is this a joke."
83,11,Vaccines are not legally required to protect people from spreading a virus. They are not legally required.
83,14,"People who do not understand the concept of a ""job"" are blaming their own health care and health system, while avoiding the dangers of wearing a mask."
83,15,"It's called a joke because the government is trying to avoid a dilution of a good joke, not because it's a joke."
83,19,The government doesn't really control the amount of money the public can spend to get rid of this.
83,20,It's not a joke.
83,25,"I think he thinks it's funny as a joke because of the fact that he says it with the ""I don't care"" phrase."
83,46,"[It's] a joke that says, ""the government can't stop the spread of a virus. They aren't legally required. They aren't legally required."

83,10,"Yes. The government has the right to prevent people from getting sick by giving people medical care, so they are required to get vaccinated, or have it approved."
83,11,It's a joke.
83,14,I think the joke about wearing a mask on a job is hilarious. It's a joke.
83,15,Vaccines are not legally required but in some places you do not have to be a doctor to wear one. I have no idea how that's possible.
83,19,"My dad had a joke that we were to protect ourselves when we got sick a while back. So he wore a mask every day and he had to tell us something. I genuinely don't care about the actual health benefits of the medical system because that's what he was thinking. It was just a joke, because he knew people had been sick enough to wear them to run, that's why I couldn't do anything with him. The truth is, he wore a mask during the day he would run to run in front of his car or"
83,20,A lot of people on here say that you have to wear a mask to protect yourself from the spread of a virus.
83,25,That's a joke.
83,46,The only thing I'm willing to change is the fact that they are a joke. I don't have to wear a mask.
83,48,"Vaccines are illegal, and the government shouldn't force people to wear them on the job unless there's a specific situation that fits them - for example - because it can make them not feel safe - if they're not going to be going on a job and there is a particular situation in which the government would like to have a serious fight with them. If they're going to have an attack on it, it would have to be pretty eloquent about the safety precautions they take to prevent the spread of HIV - and people"
83,60,Vaccines are not legally required to prevent spread of a virus. They aren't legally required unless you are a doctor.
83,71,"You have to wear a mask on your job because you don't want a virus to get to you. It is a joke because a joke means you don't think that it's a good joke. It is a joke because a joke means you know that the government doesn't want you to wear a mask on your job, but you don't really think it's a joke because it's a joke."
83,80,"I've always wondered why people wear them, because that's a funny, non-judgemental joke"
90,83,I don't see why you would say anything to this guy when it is a joke. I can only imagine how many times I would feel bad for them when it was a joke.
92,83,"I'm not a doctor. I do not want to be the first person to take a vaccine that I can't have because of illness or lack of a proper health care provider. I want to get to know you better and to stay in touch with a licensed provider. I want to know if there are any responsibilities in your life that you can't have as a doctor. I would like to get to know you better, and also why they would want to make you stop going to the CDC to get a vaccine."
93,83,"As a guy who grew up wearing a mask, I can tell you I don't think it's fun or a good idea. It's a silly joke."
83,10,I think a good joke is:
83,11,What are you trying to say?
83,14,Vaccines are not legally required unless you are a doctor. You have to wear a mask on your job unless you are a doctor. It's a joke. It's funny and not legal.
83,15,I have a few friends who wear masks as well.
83,19,"A joke, a joke, a joke. This is not really a joke."
83,20,"I'm sorry that's not my understanding. This is not a good joke, it's just a joke."
83,25,He doesn't know what a joke is. He knows what it means and doesn't care.
83,46,"You're going to get a big deal if you think the government has any say in what is a joke. I'm not going to stop them. I'm going to tell them that they're a joke, and then try to force them to get the Government involved."
83,48,"In the US, people wear hats for work, which are more likely to lead to a job attack and therefore cause a broader problem."
83,60,Vaccines are illegal. And they aren't legal. And they aren't required unless you are a doctor. Vaccines are not legally required unless you are a doctor.
83,71,"I would wear a mask if I were a doctor because I have no right to keep myself from getting sick. I know, it makes sense but it's a joke."
83,80,I don't think it is a joke.
90,83,"The fact that there are people who have a ""do you know how many people wear masks?"" comment, [https://www.fwdr.fl.gov/comments/5/AssistantAssistantAssistantAssistantAssistantAssistantAssistantAssistantAssistantAssistantAssistantAssistantAssistantAssistantAssistantAssistant"

83,11,"Isn't it safe to wear a mask in the workplace as well? I'm not a doctor, so I don't know if I could wear a mask in the office if my husband is going to get sick."

83,15,"In my country, people who wear masks have zero say in whether or not they're allowed to wear them."
83,19,"I know the idea that a doctor should take a hat to get his shit together and get a hat to cover the hat to stop the hat being inserted unless it's a doctor, and a doctor shouldn't use a mask. Honestly, I don't care if I am going to be on a run and being cynical about the hat."
83,20,"What is a joke? Vaccines are legal, if you're a doctor you have to be."
83,25,"It's funny if it's not legal, but not a joke. Those who want to protect themselves are getting sick because they want to protect their own health, unless they're in a dangerous position or are really sick."
83,46,I don't care if it's the joke.
83,48,"It's pretty easy to say they're not legal but some things are a bit different than others. You're a joke to the CDC, because your job is a joke. You can ask them ""are you OK with hats? because they're a joke? if so why are you not okay with hats? because you don't want them to change the meaning of a joke?"""
83,60,"I'm not a doctor. I am a public health officer. That means you need to be a CDC spokesman. You do not get a mandated job to be a CDC spokesman. This isn't a joke and is not a joke, it's just an insult."

90,83,I don't know about you but I think that you could be saying that you could have a very different point of view. I was told this in a TED talk and in response to an article about how I was uncomfortable with wearing a mask and I'm glad it's a part of the policy.

93,83,"Andersen & Jack & Jack are both edgy and quirky people who put out a lot of good stuff for a joke. This isn't about people who make jokes, but that's a lot of people who make great jokes in a satire that you'ren't even aware of."
83,10,Yes. It's a joke because it's a joke. It's not politically motivated.
83,11,"This is a joke in a lot of countries. The CDC doesn't need a mandate to provide a 'job' to support doctors. You are not a doctor. You don't need a job. The CDC doesn't have any mandates for doctors to do work, because they don't have the authority to prescribe the drugs."

They want you to think about how you feel in your own body and how that is harmful to your health. Unless you're really a fan of hats. You're not going to think about that."

83,11,People should be able to use a mask to prevent spread of disease without needing it.
83,14,Vaccines are not legally required in most countries because they are not mandated by the government.
83,15,That... was a good joke. It is a joke. It is a joke. It is a joke.
83,19,This is the logical conclusion of many books written by politicians:
83,20,Vaccines are legal if you're a doctor. They are legal if you have a license. They aren't even required. They are legal if you have a license and if you're a doctor you have to be. The CDC has to follow their own rules.
83,25,"Vaccines are illegal in most countries, and yes, they are."

83,60,"What about ''The Man in the Hat'' and ''Dear Senator Trump, I thought you were sarcastic.''"

83,80,"The US is one of the most anti-viral countries, and the current administration needs to put a lot more effort into controlling that."
90,83,It's a joke. It's the best part of the conversation.
92,83,The CDC and CDC are in Texas. The CDC is in Texas. The CDC is in Texas.

83,15,It's a joke.
83,19,They have done a lot to control what people do in the USA. We just need to let them go.
83,20,"The joke isn't even about the joke. It's about the fact that it was said and portrayed as a joke and not about being a shill, or having to talk to the people in the world or something. It's a joke."
83,25,It's not a joke. It's a joke. A joke. It's a joke. I think it's a joke.
83,46,I'd give them my number.

Mark said vaccines are illegal because they have the potential to cause fatalities. Vaccines are dangerous, dangerous, dangerous, and have the potential to cause fatalities. Vaccines are illegal because they have the potential to cause fatalities. They are not legally required. They are not legally required. And they are not legally required."
93,83,"It's one of the more sarcastic things in the world, and if it does get any worse, it would be as if there are a lot more people who aren't comfortable with wearing a mask."
83,10,Isn't there a good joke in that one?
83,11,"I don't know where this is from, but I would be able to go if my husband is going to get sick."
83,14,What does the CDC do?
83,15,Vaccines are illegal in most countries because they are not mandated by the government.

83,25,"Vaccines are illegal in most countries. And yes, they are. I'd like to think that the masks in the movies are in fact just a joke."

83,71,A friend of mine says that they have made it a point to stop people from getting sick and getting sick and to stop them from having to worry about it.
83,80,"I was in an office in the US for ten years and was given an anti-viral joke on the first day I got home from work. I kept the face mask and put on a shirt with my hands down and stayed out of the office for four days while wearing them. It made me feel a lot better, and I'm just so ashamed to have lost one hand to my insecurities."

92,83,I was in a similar situation to Mark and he said he had been sick in the past.

83,15,Vaccines are illegal in most countries because they are not mandated by the government. I don't know why this is a joke.
83,19,There are a couple of good ones if you're in the mood for something different.
83,20,"I would probably feel a bit uncomfortable for wearing a mask on a job, but that's just not what a joke is."
83,25,"In my opinion, a joke isn't a joke. A joke is a joke that happens in public. But the actual joke is in the story, if not the actual joke. I think the whole idea of a joke is that the CDC and the FDA are all trying to fix this."
83,46,"The government is taking the blame for what they can't do in the UK, and we will get better if we do that. They are doing this because fucking a lot of people don't wear masks."

83,60,Vaccines are illegal because they have the potential to cause fatalities. Vaccines are illegal because they have the potential to cause fatalities.
83,71,"I'm very sick and sick because of vaccines, and I'm getting sick to death. It's so embarrassing that if a doctor had a doctor come in a couple of days and didn't have a sprained ankle or something, they would need to say something to him."
83,80,The current administration is blatantly discrediting it and putting a lot of pressure on the government to remove it from the public eye.
90,83,I have a feeling that I have a virus and that I can't fuck around with a mask because it messes with my immune system.
92,83,"If you have a case in Texas where the CDC and CDC are not a federal agency, you should call the department of public health and be sure that you know of all of these things."

83,14,I'm the CDC's assistant.
83,15,It's about what's a joke.
83,19,Vaccines are illegal in most countries.

83,48,"I have a friend that is a CDC aficionado who was just told that when people said they would wear a mask for a job, their doctor would be asking him to leave, so he would be wearing a mask to keep the virus at bay. It is the CDC's job to deal with the virus as they rely on you to protect you."
83,60,"I don't even have a clue why the movie ended despite a doctor mentioning it, but that's not what I'm talking about."
83,71,"CANNOTANSWER, MD: “I am so sorry mark but I don't trust the vaccine.” I'm a bit worried that a movie, like that, might end up a joke."
83,80,We need more sexist and anti-vaccine stances. The masks are just jokes.
90,83,You're using the word 'raped' wrong. You sound more like the other commenter.

83,15,The movie [Cannonman) is not about a joke.
83,19,Vaccines are illegal in most countries because they aren't mandated by the government. Vaccines are legal. They aren't. But they aren't. And they aren't. And they aren't required.

83,25,"""Vaccines are illegal in most countries. And yes, they are."","
83,46,This is a great question. I can't help but wonder what the reason is.
83,48,The US has a few exceptions. One is just a few. One is a one time thing. One is a joke.
83,60,Vaccines are not legally required because they have the potential to cause fatalities. Vaccines are not legal because they have the potential to cause fatalities.
83,71,Because it is funny that a joke is not the end all.
83,80,"> You can't wear a mask in the government to aid in stopping the spread of a virus. If you know what I mean, a lot of people think that the government is trying to change the system and make them work better, and that's what a joke is. I'm also an HIV patient."
90,83,"That's right. It's a joke, but it's a joke and it's not a joke."
92,83,"In Texas they need to be notified by state agency to the Federal Department of Health, so they have to provide the medical kit, not the vaccinated person's prescription. The doctor must be on his own and not contracted. There's no statutory authority on vaccination."
93,83,I like the idea of a mask on a run and would wear it in case it was a joke.
83,10,"I feel like if you want to be the joke, then you need to be the joke."
83,11,"""Making fun of people in the workplace, but you're not a doctor, you don't need a job, and I don't have a job, so I think we should be able to do something funny."""
83,14,"As an Md, I am afraid of having to put on a mask. Is the health care of other people good? Does the job elicit health care information?"
83,15,There is no way we are going to go down this path with the government without the people to agree on a side of things. We have a lot of stances that have never been discussed in the other places. There are plenty of places where people can be abused based on how they behave. That's a joke in itself.
83,19,A joke? There's something really funny about this.
83,20,That's one of the big ones.
83,25,"I'm not sure what to say to those who have thought that it's a joke and are now thinking of sexist jokes. But I can't say how many more of them are actually funny and some are just sexist jokes, that's why you got downvoted."
83,46,If you read the comments you'll see the first part:
83,48,The whole point of the joke isn't to get the CDC to make it illegal and force a person to wear them at all. It's about helping people prevent the spread of a virus.
83,60,It's a joke.
83,71,I was in the military when I learned that vaccines are not required.
83,80,"If they need to wear a mask, they can't. You're being an asshole, and there are only a few reasons they can't."
90,83,I think the joke is that it's not the only thing in the world that is a joke.
92,83,The joke isn't about the CDC and it's not about the CDC. It's about the CDC and the CDC not doing their own thing.
93,83,"No one likes a joke because its an old joke, and it sounds like a ripoff of a book. But it's a ripoff, and it's hilarious and the humor it makes seems like it's not the only thing."
83,10,The first part of the title is an interesting response.
83,11,And that is why you're a huge fan of this.
83,14,"The word ""joke"" isn't as funny, but it's in reference to the joke 'Making fun of people''."
83,15,"You can make the joke about this if you want. It's a joke. It doesn't mean anything. I'm not saying it's the best thing to do, but it's not a joke. I'm saying it's the most appropriate way to do it."
83,19,I think you're getting really downvoted here. This isn't a joke. I think this is a joke.
83,20,> The whole point of the joke isn't to get the CDC to make it illegal and force a person to wear them at all.
83,25,">I think if we need more fads. But it's actually pretty easy to give them an incentive to be more protective than the government."","
83,46,"There's a problem, though."
83,48,"There's an argument that the masks should be on a bus, but not on a job."
83,60,"People have to ask themselves: Why is the movie a joke? Because you need to make sure they think they are telling a joke. Because they are sexist, but because people are using it as an excuse to not get a job? Because they don't want to pay for that job? Because they don't want to get a job? Because that's what a joke is."
83,71,"Despite all of the above comments about what the federal government's stance on vaccination is, what this story is based on sounds pretty funny to me. There is no statutory authority on vaccinations. The health department, however, does not have authority over the use of vaccinations."
83,80,"I thought I was the only one here. I'm a bit concerned, and it seems I'm the only one who hasn't heard a joke."
90,83,"I am surprised that 'assistant' actually referred to himself as an ""assistant"" to anyone in public."

83,11,"So, in a few words:"
83,14,"This sounds like a great idea, but it's also not quite funny because the CDC's stance on vaccines are so sexist it's very ridiculous"
83,15,This isn't a joke. This is a joke.
83,19,"I'm a guy who ran in the military, got a bit sick while I was there, and I had no idea there were anything serious about it. Honestly, I think this is the most humorous thing I've ever heard. I'm still cynical."
83,20,I am a doctor and I work on a full schedule for the government and I see no need for a mask on the job. But I feel like the joke is about people who don't know where they are and want to be more protective.

83,60,"""They're not legally required to prevent spread of a virus. They aren't legally required unless you are a doctor."","
83,71,This is the best way to describe the vaccines that are in the United States.

90,83,I think they've gotta change the name. What is the joke?

83,14,I'm a doctor and I'm not a medical assistant.
83,15,"The whole vaccine joke is a joke, you're just going to do whatever you want. And then the joke is based on a fact: a group of people are going to be going to a movie that is about an epidemic of HIV."
83,19,"I can understand being cynical about this, but I also see the point that a mask is about preventing people from getting sick. I don't understand the premise of a joke if I don't believe it."
83,20,They are legal if you have a license. They are legal if you're a doctor and you have to be. The CDC has to follow their own rules. It's not a joke.

83,46,"I have to go get the doctor, it's in my budget, I have to pay for it!"
83,48,People who can't do the job without a mask are allowed to use them in the context of public work.

You know, that's all, I get to play a lot of the sarcastic ones in the comics, but it's really not that funny if it's an impromptu piece of writing. You might also like the book. But you'd probably never get into it, it's just one of those books that's the best kind of sarcastic if the joke doesn't make sense"
83,10,"The government has the right to prevent people from getting sick by giving people medical care, so they are required to get vaccinated, or have it approved."
83,11,"It doesn't mean a joke. It means a joke, which explains why you need a job to protect yourself from spreading a virus. But it also means it means you need a job. Especially if the health department is there."

83,19,"[The film is directed by Mark Rupert.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas/Vaxx-Habrg/), is a fictionalized documentary, and was made up by David Hicks and Steven Adler. The movie is also directed by Tom Hanks (whose voice is in the book)."
83,20,[The first sentence makes it sound like the government is making the joke.
83,25,"If you read the book, you will understand that it was a joke. It is also a joke. It’s a joke."
83,46,"""As of December 10, 2010) Wearing a mask on our jobs and put on a mask is the best way to stay safe."
83,48,"People who have a job don't wear hats. I don't think that's how many people do, I've just gotta remember that."
83,60,"""Vaccines are not legally required because they have the potential to cause fatalities."
83,71,I can't really tell if this is a joke or not. The government seems to have little control over the spread of HIV/AIDS.
83,80,"I think the joke is sexist because people are not willing to put their heads in the sand when they're vaccinated by a doctor who doesn't really like to wear masks. The joke is that the people wearing masks in this situation don't like putting on a mask because they're not allowed to go out in public, and then just wear them on their head."
90,83,">I don't know why you would say anything to this guy when it is a joke. It's a joke, but it's not funny. The joke isn't funny. People use the word 'a joke' to stop the spread of the virus. They're trying to stop the spread of the virus. The government isn't responsible for the spread of the virus. They're trying to stop the spread of the virus. It's an inhumane joke, that's what."""

83,10,"'We don't even have to wear a mask on the job, but we do have to wear a mask on the job, we have to wear a mask'"
83,11,This is a very very complex question. And the first sentence is a rip off of the book. And so it's the most reasonable answer. I don't think the humor is appropriate.
83,14,If it's a joke then its not a joke.
83,15,The government is trying to prevent this shit.
83,19,"People have a right to want a doctor to see them, but no one can afford to know what a doctor's opinion is or how it's perceived to have a right to the government."
83,20,"It sounds like the government is trying to stop a virus from spreading on your dick, that's why."
83,25,"I've seen this movie about a dozen times, and I don't care."
83,46,I read a book about the AIDS epidemic a while back and it was such a bad book. I couldn't handle that.
83,48,I'm a doctor here. The movie is a joke.
83,60,I'm going to keep it short for [i think I'm a joke.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas/Vaxx-Habrg/)
83,71,"A doctor told me that when I was working as an assassin in the army, they'd want me to wear a mask on the job in order to prevent someone else from getting sick. The guy asked why I was uncomfortable with my mask and I responded with ""no I am not going to change your mind. You've made me a mess a lot and I am not going to change your mind. This is what they want me to do."""
83,80,"I'm a doctor, I am a doctor, and I would not go to the CDC for a mask to prevent the spread of a virus. And a mask in public would be an awesome way to get out and see people and do their best to protect themselves."
90,83,The article goes on to say that this is one of the most recent examples of this type of behavior to occur in the US in the context of the CDC and that the FDA is working on reducing the spread of AIDS.
92,83,"I am an RN with a degree in a variety of fields, so I have no legal knowledge of those fields or the CDC, but I can confirm with a general practitioner in an office that is not a veterinary doctor if they are not able to prescribe vaccinations."
93,83,"No, they were based off of the book."
